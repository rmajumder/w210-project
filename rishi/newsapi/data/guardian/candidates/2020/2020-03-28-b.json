  "<p>Sir Denis Follows, 71, short and bald, started every day\u2019s work by opening his post. It was a habit he\u2019d had as secretary of the Football Association, and a habit he kept as chairman of the British Olympic Association. In between the two jobs, he\u2019d been knighted. Which was some going, for the son of a stationmaster, but it hadn\u2019t changed him much. He still wore a pair of thick horn rims, still worried about putting on weight, was still the same avuncular, pragmatic man who had kept the Jules Rimet trophy under his bed and carried it out to Mexico 70 in his briefcase. And he still had the same set of principles.</p> <p>First among them his idea that sport was above politics. Follows was so \u00adadamant about this that his own daughter still isn\u2019t sure which way he voted, and that adamancy made him one of the key figures in what the Labour parliamentarian Denis Howell described as \u201cthe most epic political battle in which I have ever been engaged\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/24/olympic-postponement-inevitable-but-finding-right-way-to-do-it-caused-delay\">How Tokyo's 2020 hopes turned to ashes \u2013 but can rise again in 2021 | Sean Ingle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On Tuesday 22 January 1980, Follows\u2019s morning mail included a \u00adletter from the prime \u00administer, Margaret Thatcher. A month \u00adearlier, the Soviet Union had invaded Afghanistan; six months later, the Soviet Union was due to host the Olympics. Thatcher and the US \u00adpresident, Jimmy Carter, had already decided on a boycott. Thatcher\u2019s foreign secretary, Lord Carrington, pointed out that there was just one problem: \u201cparticipation is not a \u00admatter for governments\u201d, but the national Olympic associations. All the government could do was advise on a course of action.</p> <p>Still, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/feb/24/past.Olympics2012\">the prime minister willed it</a>, when the president of the US wanted it, how much of a \u00adproblem could it really be? Looking back on the Moscow boycott 40 years later, with the benefit of all Thatcher\u2019s declassified papers, briefings and correspondence, the most striking thing about it is how this one man, Sir Denis Follows, an elderly bureaucrat, squared up to the two most \u00adpowerful leaders in the western world and stared them down.</p> <p>\u201cIn an ideal world, I would share entirely the philosophy of the Olympic movement that sport should be divorced from politics, sadly, however, this is no longer a realistic view,\u201d Thatcher wrote. To go to Moscow \u201cwould be to give the \u00adappearance of condoning\u201d the \u00adinvasion. It didn\u2019t occur to her that Follows might \u00addisagree. She pressed ahead with asking him to \u201capproach the International Olympic Committee urgently and propose that the Summer Games be moved from the Soviet Union\u201d. She was convinced the Games should be relocated and suggested Britain could co-host them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e387ea2771c8071f5d616d49c63ae025863b0e64\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e387ea2771c8071f5d616d49c63ae025863b0e64/0_329_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Former British Olympic Association chairman Sir Denis Follows (centre) insisted sporting boycotts \u2018never do anyone any good\u2019, much to the chagrin of Margaret Thatcher.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Former British Olympic Association chairman Sir Denis Follows (centre) insisted sporting boycotts \u2018never do anyone any good\u2019, much to the chagrin of Margaret Thatcher.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Thatcher had made a mistake here, as the West German chancellor, Helmut Schmidt, took great pleasure in explaining to Carrington. Her idea to move the Games at six months\u2019 notice was \u201ca still-born child\u201d, Schmidt said. \u201cThose who proposed it had no concept of the organisation of international sport.\u201d But she stuck with it and had a working party run up a list of available venues, even after Follows had told her that the IOC\u2019s response to her idea was \u201cnot \u00addifficult to imagine\u201d.</p> <p>So Thatcher ramped up her \u00adrhetoric. \u201cThe Soviet government hope as another government did in 1936 that the Games will give an immense boost to the state\u2019s prestige internationally,\u201d she told parliament. \u201cThe solution is to move the Games to a place where politics do not predominate.\u201d (The Labour MP Eric Heffer called out: \u201cWhere\u2019s that? The moon?\u201d)</p> <p>Carter, who was facing an election in the autumn, was so glad for her support that he wrote her a \u201cDear Margaret\u201d to express his \u201cdeep personal appreciation\u201d for her speech and applaud her \u201cleadership in launching the Olympic boycott\u201d. In private, her press secretary, Bernard Ingham, was briefing that Thatcher had won over \u201cthe US, the UK, Australia, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Iran, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Bahrain\u201d to the boycott. Or so they thought.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/jun/15/50-olympic-stunning-moments-allan-wells\">50 stunning Olympic moments No39: Allan Wells wins 100m gold in Moscow | Rob Bagchi</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Then, on 1 February, Follows sent his full reply. There was \u201clittle or no support for the suggestion the Games be moved\u201d he said. As for the \u00adboycott, it wasn\u2019t just his decision, but had to be made by a committee of the heads of each of the individual sports \u00adfederations. They were due to vote on 4 March but had postponed until 25 March, because they had \u201cno desire to embarrass the government\u201d. Follows told Thatcher to \u201crest assured your views will be considered\u201d.</p> <p>Thatcher didn\u2019t \u201crest assured\u201d. Three days later, the cabinet started discussing the possibility of withdrawing all their funding to the Sports Council, who funnelled public money to the BOA. It decided not to. But there were other levers to pull. The government talked to the BBC about cancelling coverage, British Airways about cancelling charter flights to Moscow and the BOA\u2019s corporate partners about cancelling sponsorship. Bupa did and the BOA were left scrabbling to scrape together funds in a public fundraising drive, boosted by support from the unions and several Labour councils.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In the Commons, Cranley Onslow MP blamed Follows\u2019 'thick skull' for causing 'a national disgrace'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Thatcher wrote again to Follows: \u201cFor British athletes to go would be for them to seem to condone an international crime.\u201d She decided to deny leave to all civil service, military and police personnel who were due to compete. That, Follows said, \u201crather stiffened\u201d his resolve. When he was called in to face the foreign affairs select committee, he fired back. \u201cBoycotts never do anyone any good,\u201d he said. \u201cSport helps to bridge the gulf between nations, it is the most unifying thing in the world today.\u201d Follows did promise the BOA would \u201cnot ignore\u201d a vote in the Commons on the boycott. But he didn\u2019t promise they would obey it.</p> <p>The MPs voted for the boycott by 315 to 147. Thatcher, who had said she was astonished by Follows\u2019s stance at the select committee, wrote to him again. She was more placatory this time. \u201cWe have the highest admiration for the Olympic ideals. It is not we who are perverting that ideal; rather, it is the Soviet Union.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d60609d4db2dc4da174057f6d1aea16a69321361\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d60609d4db2dc4da174057f6d1aea16a69321361/0_137_3602_2162/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The opening ceremony of the Moscow Olympics in 1980.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The opening ceremony of the Moscow Olympics in 1980.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tony Duffy/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By now, Carter\u2019s special counsel, Lloyd Cutler, had flown to Europe to meet Follows. Cutler was clear the success of the boycott turned on how Thatcher handled the BOA. \u201cThe prospects for the political success of the boycott remain good provided the impending British defection can be deferred or contained,\u201d Cutler said. The problem was Follows. \u201cSir Denis is a living Colonel Blimp,\u201d he told Carter. \u201cHe is a pure Olympian who puts aside all responsibilities as a \u00adcitizen of the west in favour of sports as the last hope of world peace. His views of Mrs Thatcher and the president are visibly apoplectic.\u201d The feeling was mutual.</p> <p>Follows told Cutler he was \u00ad\u201cperfectly willing to have the British team be the only western European team in Moscow because this would show the BOA followed Olympic principles while the others bowed to their governments\u201d even though \u201che knows the effect on the British government\u2019s prestige at home and abroad will be disastrous\u201d.</p> <p>On 25 March, the BOA voted to go to the Moscow Games. \u201cServes her right,\u201d said Schmidt. Thatcher warned that it was \u201cnot the end of the matter\u201d. In the Commons, the Conservative Cranley Onslow blamed Follows\u2019 \u201cthick skull\u201d for causing \u201ca national disgrace\u201d, and his colleague Keith Best asked Thatcher to \u201cwrite a charming letter to Sir Denis Follows not necessarily describing any part of his anatomy\u201d.</p> <p>But Thatcher was wrong. It was the end of the matter. The British team travelled and won 21 medals, five of them gold, for Duncan Goodhew, Daley Thompson, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2006/mar/05/features.sport9\">Allan Wells</a>, Steve Ovett and Seb Coe, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/apr/18/50-olympic-moments-coe-ovett-moscow-1980\">fought their famous duels over 800m and 1500m</a>.</p> <p>Thatcher conspicuously did not invite them, or anyone else, to Downing Street to celebrate. By the time the team were home, Carter\u2019s boycott was already seen as a public relations disaster. His policy foundered on the rock of Follows\u2019s principles. History isn\u2019t always the work of great men, but sometimes modest, unassuming ones too.</p>",

Tara Reade, who worked with Biden when he was a Delaware senator, alleges he inappropriately touched her and penetrated her with his fingers without consent in 1993.</p> <p>\u201cIt happened all at once, and then \u2026 his hands were on me and underneath my clothes,\u201d Reade recalled in an interview <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/katie-halper/tara-to-post\">with podcast host Katie Halper</a> on Wednesday. \u201cHe said \u2018come on, man, I heard you liked me. For me, it was like, everything shattered \u2026 I wanted to be a senator; I didn\u2019t want to sleep with one.\u201d</p> <p>Rightwing news outlets have gleefully seized upon the accusations against Biden; the story has also been discussed by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/zackbeauchamp/status/1243246641072738304?s=20\">left</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/zackbeauchamp/status/1243246641072738304?s=20\">wing commentators</a>. However, the mainstream media has largely ignored the allegations. Instead there have been headlines like <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/26/politics/joe-biden-kamala-harris-elizabeth-warren-amy-klobuchar/index.htm\">The top 10 women Joe Biden might pick as VP</a> (CNN) and <a href=\"https://apnews.com/d71a735b53f8a5c9c417e144de9af544\">Joe Biden\u2019s inner circle: No longer a boy\u2019s club</a> (AP).</p> <p>It is hugely frustrating to see conservatives, who couldn\u2019t give a damn about the multiple sexual assault allegations against Donald Trump, weaponize the accusations against Biden. However, it\u2019s also frustrating to see so many liberals turning a blind eye. The accusations against the former vice-president are serious; why aren\u2019t they being taken seriously?</p> <p>One obvious reason is that Reade\u2019s accusations are very hard to prove. The incident happened a long time ago and there weren\u2019t any witnesses. Reade also gave a slightly different version of events last year; she <a href=\"https://www.theunion.com/news/nevada-county-woman-says-joe-biden-inappropriately-touched-her-while-working-in-his-u-s-senate-office/\">accused Biden</a> of touching her neck and shoulders in a way that was inappropriate and uncomfortable, but did not say anything sexual took place. This inconsistency obviously doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s lying; unfortunately, it is easy to use against her.</p> <p>Reade\u2019s story may be impossible to verify, but this is the case with the vast majority of sexual assault allegations. It is nearly always a case of \u201che said, she said\u201d \u2013 and it is nearly always the \u201che\u2019 that is automatically believed. The #MeToo mantra \u201cBelieve Women\u201d doesn\u2019t mean that women never lie; it means that our systems of power are biased towards believing men never lie. It means that it takes decades of allegations and scores of women coming forward for powerful men like Harvey Weinstein, Jeffrey Epstein and Bill Cosby to be brought to justice. All the mantra means is that you shouldn\u2019t automatically disbelieve women.</p> <p>You know who has talked publicly about the importance of taking women seriously? Biden. During the Brett Kavanaugh hearings, Biden stood up for Dr Christine Blasey Ford, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/joe-biden-when-a-woman-alleges-sexual-assault-presume-she-is-telling-the-truth/2018/09/17/7718c532-badd-11e8-a8aa-860695e7f3fc_story.html\">noting</a>: \u201cFor a woman to come forward in the glaring lights of focus, nationally, you\u2019ve got to start off with the presumption that at least the essence of what she\u2019s talking about is real.\u201d</p> <p>Does this presumption not apply when the guy being accused is a Democrat running for president? It would seem that way. In January, according to <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/03/24/joe-biden-metoo-times-up/\">reporting from the Intercept</a>, Reade asked for help from the Time\u2019s Up Legal Defense Fund, which has supported accusers of high-profile people like Weinstein. Reade was reportedly told by the National Women\u2019s Law Center, the organization within which the Time\u2019s Up fund is housed, that it couldn\u2019t assist with accusations against a presidential candidate because it would jeopardize their non-profit status. The Intercept further notes that \u201cthe public relations firm that works on behalf of the Time\u2019s Up Legal Defense Fund is SKDKnickerbocker, whose managing director, Anita Dunn, is the top adviser to Biden\u2019s presidential campaign\u201d.</p> <p>There are some people who will insist that drawing attention to the new allegations against Biden is playing into the Republicans\u2019 hands. That it will destroy Biden\u2019s campaign and guarantee us four more years of Trump. Not only is that argument hypocritical, it is also hugely unlikely that Reade\u2019s accusations will do any damage whatsoever to Biden\u2019s ambitions. Allegations of sexual assault certainly haven\u2019t posed any hindrance to Trump. The allegations against Kavanaugh didn\u2019t stop him from becoming a supreme court justice. The allegations against Louis CK didn\u2019t kill his career in comedy. And the <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/joe-biden-allegations-women-2020-campaign-2019-6\">multiple women</a> who have accused Biden of touching them inappropriately in the past haven\u2019t exactly derailed his career.</p> <h2>Why does coronavirus kill more men than women?</h2> <p>Around the world, men in every age bracket are dying from coronavirus at higher rates than women. Men have accounted for 71% of Covid-19 deaths in Italy, for example.

  "<p>In recent days, we have witnessed an astonishing about-face by Republican politicians on policies that were anathema to them just a few short years or even weeks ago. Democrats must use the occasion to press home the fundamental wrongheadedness of the Republican worldview before they inevitably reverse course and pretend that nothing has changed.</p> <p>Let\u2019s start with stimulus. I remember early 2009, when the economy was melting under the weight of home foreclosures and bankruptcies that led to what is now called the Great Recession, the second worst economic downturn in history after the Great Depression.</p> <p>Conservative economists opposed fiscal stimulus for various reasons. They said it would not work because the deficit took out of the economy whatever the stimulus put in, making it a wash, economically. They said that any government stimulus would delay the necessary economic readjustment and sow the seeds of the next recession. The deficit was already too large and stimulus would only make it worse; fiscal prudence would do more to revive the economy than make-work jobs and such, many argued.</p> <p>Implicitly, Republicans favored a do-nothing policy. I don\u2019t recall any meaningful alternative stimulus program. Indeed, I still recall some saying government spending should be slashed to reduce the burden of government, which would be the best stimulus. None seemed to be aware that this is exactly what Franklin Roosevelt did in 1937 and it quickly led to a <a href=\"https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/recession_of_1937_38\">sharp economic downturn</a>.</p> <p>Republicans also decried bailouts for private businesses, especially those carried out under <a href=\"https://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/financial-stability/TARP-Programs/Pages/default.aspx\">Tarp</a>, the Troubled Asset Relief Program. Subsequently, Republicans universally blamed Barack Obama for any problems with this program even though it was proposed, enacted and signed into law by George W Bush.</p> <p>A few conservative academic economists resisted the do-nothing approach, rightly fearing a replay of the Great Depression, which only got so bad because of Herbert Hoover\u2019s do-nothing policies in 1929-1933. But they also argued that fiscal stimulus was unnecessary and counterproductive. Rather, they said that the Federal Reserve could fix the problem easily with no need to expand government.</p> <p>Such economists, such as <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/event/infrastructure-spending-grow\">Anna J Schwartz</a> and Robert Lucas, harkened back to the work of Milton Friedman, who died in 2006. He had <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/books/frie65-1\">argued</a> that the Great Depression was due solely to the Fed\u2019s mistake in allowing the money supply to shrink by a third, which created deflation. This came about because when banks went under in those days depositors lost everything; their money, which was mostly in the form of checking accounts, literally disappeared.</p> <p>Friedman said that the Fed could have countered this deflation by buying vast amounts of Treasury securities and creating the money out of thin air to do so. Indeed, that is the Fed\u2019s standard operating procedure to this day, which is called an <a href=\"https://www.stlouisfed.org/in-plain-english/a-closer-look-at-open-market-operations\">open-market operation</a>. It increases the money supply and leads to economic expansion \u2013 and inflation, eventually. Conversely, when the Fed sells securities from its portfolio the money supply shrinks and inflationary pressure diminishes.</p> <p>As it happened, the chairman of the Fed at that time was a Republican economist named Ben Bernanke, who had previously served as George W Bush\u2019s principal economic adviser. Bernanke was also extremely familiar with Friedman\u2019s work, having devoted his academic career to studying it. Bernanke implemented exactly the policies Friedman would have advocated and it successfully kept the banking system from imploding as it did during the Great Depression.</p> <p>Rather than praise Bernanke, however, conservative economists largely turned against him. So opposed were they to any stimulus whatsoever they even opposed what Friedman advocated. By 2010, they were predicting hyperinflation from Bernanke\u2019s policies and he was urged to <a href=\"https://economics21.org/html/open-letter-ben-bernanke-287.html\">reverse them as soon as possible</a>.</p> <p>Now, of course, all these conservative ideas have gone out the window. Republicans are pushing a $2tn stimulus, even though just a few weeks ago the $1tn Green New Deal to save the planet itself was deemed too expensive. A huge chunk of the stimulus is in the form of bailouts for big businesses. Opposition to such bailouts led to creation of the Tea Party in 2009. Where are they today? (Sound of crickets chirping.)</p> <p>The chairman of the Fed, Republican Jay Powell, appointed by Donald Trump, is pumping up the money supply with his foot all the way down on the accelerator. (Disclosure: Powell and I worked together at the treasury department.) Yet Trump and his staff continually berate him for not being even more aggressive. No letters from conservative economists warning of hyperinflation are anywhere in sight.</p> <p>The hypocrisy is so thick you can choke on it, but at least for now we need fiscal stimulus, easy money and maybe some bailouts too for the same reasons we needed them back in 2009, when virtually every Republican in Congress voted against Obama\u2019s $800bn stimulus, much more modest than Trump\u2019s.</p> <p>However, Republicans\u2019 propensity to lie and reverse course when it suits them means they will inevitably become born-again deficit hawks warning about the evil Fed and its hyperinflationary policies one minute after Joe Biden is elected. I have warned about this before in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/nov/20/republican-tax-cuts-democrats\">the Guardian</a>. Just as Bill Clinton wasted most of his first year getting a budget deal passed, I expect that Republicans and their allies on Wall Street will do the same to Biden.</p> <ul> <li><p>Bruce Bartlett is an economist who has worked on Capitol Hill, in the White House, and at the treasury department.

  "<p>Video conferences from a basement, glitchy internet and bouts of restlessness. Joe Biden, like the rest of America, is working from home.</p> <p>The former vice-president\u2019s confinement began abruptly on 10 March, when he touched down in Cleveland for a primary-night campaign event only to learn that the state\u2019s governor had called for all major indoor events to be canceled as the nation slowly grasped the seriousness of the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>That night, one of the most consequential of the Democratic primary, he delivered a victory speech from a nearly empty room in Philadelphia, near where his campaign is headquartered. It was his last traditional event on a campaign trail that has now changed beyond recognition. </p> <p>Since then Biden, a retail politician who enjoys rope lines and now-forbidden handshakes, has become an unwilling pioneer in presidential campaigning in the age of the coronavirus as the pandemic has thrown the Democratic race \u2013 and all US politics \u2013 into confusion.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s no playbook for what a former vice-president should be doing or saying in the middle of a global pandemic,\u201d said the Democratic strategist Lis Smith, who helped catapult the former South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg from obscurity to contention in the Democratic primary. \u201cWe are in uncharted waters here.\u201d</p> <p>Biden\u2019s campaign has converted fundraising events to virtual ones and his podium is a room in his basement in his Wilmington, Delaware, home. His public appearances are usually once-a-day televised critiques of whatever Donald Trump\u2019s administration is doing to combat the virus. His campaign has cautiously been exploring new ways to keep supporters active.</p> <p>But the Democratic frontrunner is still grappling with how to adapt to the new challenges. His first live-streamed town hall, on 13 March, was hampered by audio and technical difficulties. \u201cI\u2019m sorry this has been such a disjointed effort here because of the connections,\u201d Biden said, his irritation evident.</p> <p>He then seemed to fade from the national stage, eclipsed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/24/donald-trump-coronavirus-briefings-2020-campaign-rallies\">Trump\u2019s daily White House coronavirus briefings</a> and by governors including Andrew Cuomo, whose daily updates on the toll of the crisis in New York have become must-watch TV for many Americans.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/25/democrats-woman-vice-president-joe-biden-running-mate\">\u2018Opening a door that was closed too long\u2019: the hunt for a female vice-president</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Biden\u2019s absence inspired the Twitter hashtag #whereisJoe, which was promoted and shared by supporters of his Democratic rival, Senator Bernie Sanders, before being picked up by the Trump campaign.</p> <p>On a fundraising call last weekend, a Biden donor noted that Americans watch Trump every day at his briefings, events that his critics say increasingly resemble \u2013 in tone and length \u2013 the campaign rallies he has been forced to abandon.</p> <p>\u201cI would just love to see you more,\u201d the donor said of the Democrat. \u201cLike how do we get more of you and less of him on our airwaves?\u201d</p> <p>Biden assured the donor that he was raring for a comeback: his team had installed high-speed internet and built a TV studio in his basement. Soon Biden was pushing out his message. In a matter of days the question would be: where isn\u2019t Biden?</p> <p>He began the week with an address from the newly outfitted recreation room, books, a lamp and memorabilia from his decades in public life behind him. The speech was followed by back-to-back TV appearances, roundtables, a virtual happy hour with young voters, the launch of a newsletter, a podcast in the works and a CNN town hall.</p> <p>The former vice-president has also enlisted an advisory board to counsel the campaign on the coronavirus that includes Ron Klain, who coordinated the Obama White House\u2019s Ebola response. An <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1241416531684331526\">explainer video featuring </a>Klain and a white board has already racked up millions of views.</p> <p>\u201cThe new technologies are quite effective,\u201d Biden mused to reporters on Wednesday, noting that a recent address was not carried by the national TV networks but received 3.8m views online.</p> <p>Yet even with the ramped-up online schedule, it can still be difficult for Biden to break through as he is overshadowed by other figures actually fighting on the frontlines. On Monday, he delivered his speech an hour earlier than advertised; it would otherwise have conflicted with a Cuomo press briefing. His interview with The View on Wednesday was pre-empted by another Cuomo briefing and a press conference with the Washington DC mayor, Muriel Bowser.</p> <p>After serving more than 30 years in the Senate and eight years as vice-president, Biden acknowledged the difficulty of watching his former colleagues \u2013 and presidential rivals \u2013 confront the pandemic while he watched from the sidelines as a private citizen with nothing but a bully pulpit at his disposal.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m chomping at the bit. I wish I were still in the Senate, you know, being able to impact on some things,\u201d Biden told reporters on video conference press call hosted by Zoom. \u201cBut I am where I am.\u201d</p> <p>But critics still aren\u2019t convinced that Biden is doing enough to prove that he is ready to take on Trump in November.</p> <p>\u201cI think that he needs to lead,\u201d Larry Cohen, the chairman of the pro-Sanders Our Revolution organization, said. \u201cHe could collaborate with Bernie, who\u2019s doing plenty, and they could lead together on an issue that unites all Democrats. It\u2019s unimaginable to me what\u2019s going on with him, period.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ba1260fcf187c98104549e39faa1e332c8a2a750\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ba1260fcf187c98104549e39faa1e332c8a2a750/0_158_5264_3160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chicago residents watch Joe Biden during his Illinois virtual town hall on 13 March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chicago residents watch Joe Biden during his Illinois virtual town hall on 13 March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charles Rex Arbogast/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For much of the 2020 campaign, Biden\u2019s signature approach was to avoid unnecessary fights and press. His campaign allowed the nearly two dozen other candidates in the primary to have their moments in the sun before imploding. But now that low-key approach might work against him.</p> <p>Even before the pandemic hit, Democrats worried about being able to match the Trump re-election campaign\u2019s financial war chest. Biden, throughout the primary campaign, has been out-raised by his rivals. Campaigning from afar during a pandemic isn\u2019t going to make raising cash any easier \u2013 especially with a team not noted for its digital prowess.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/26/trump-facebook-ads-immigrants-coronavirus\">Trump's deluge of Facebook ads have a curious absence: coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cFundraising has been a challenge for Joe Biden since he started running for president 500 years ago,\u201d quipped Connor Farrell, a veteran Democratic fundraiser. \u201cThis cycle in particular has been no exception. He\u2019s been trailing his competitors throughout the primary but it\u2019s obviously shown money isn\u2019t everything. That being said, he does need lots and lots of money to take on Donald Trump. In particular, his online fundraising hasn\u2019t been as good as other candidates and that\u2019s going to become much more important now that you can\u2019t do in-person fundraisers, where he shakes down executive and wealthy donors for checks in person.\u201d</p> <p>Farrell added that Biden \u201cis going to have to rely on telephone calls and digital fundraising. There\u2019s no other way around it.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not a great sign that their first fundraiser via Zoom was rescheduled due to technical difficulties,\u201d Farrell added. \u201cThis is a skill that the campaign needs to learn yesterday for the future of the country.\u201d</p> <p>The Trump campaign has pivoted from taunting Biden over his absence on the national stage to mocking his re-emergence. An email blast from the Republican National Committee accused the former vice-president of attempting a \u201csorry interpretation of a president\u201d.</p> <p>Biden has been critical of Trump\u2019s response, but he has also insisted he doesn\u2019t want to engage Trump in a \u201cpolitical fight\u201d with so much at stake for the American people.</p> <p>\u201cThe coronavirus is not his fault, but the lack of speed with which to respond to it has to move much faster,\u201d he said on The View. \u201cThis is not about Democrat or Republican. This is not about what your party is. It\u2019s about getting through this.\u201d</p> <p>At the moment, however, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/26/coronavirus-donald-trump-triumph-or-disaster\">Trump is enjoying</a> the highest approval rating of his presidency, with 60% supportive of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, according to the <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/298313/president-trump-job-approval-rating.aspx\">latest Gallup poll</a>.</p> <p>Gallup noted a \u201cpresidential rally effect\u201d in moments of national crisis as a possible explanation.</p> <p>Biden\u2019s predicament is also complicated by the fact that he is not yet the party\u2019s nominee. Despite consecutive weeks of victories, and an all-but insurmountable delegate lead, Sanders has shown no signs of leaving the race any time soon.</p> <p>Instead, the Vermont senator has turned his campaign into a pandemic response operation, hosting expert roundtables and leveraging his vast network of donors to raise money for organizations helping to alleviate the economic impact of the crisis. And this week his campaign called for yet another Democratic primary debate.</p> <p>But, with a long time to go until November, and the whole world in flux, Biden and his time still have ample time to make a difference.</p> <p>Mo Eilethee, a former Democratic communications strategist and the executive director of Georgetown University\u2019s Institute of Politics and Public Service, said offering a radically different vision of leadership during moments of national crisis was a \u201cliving, breathing example of why Biden got into the race in the first place\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cHe can use these opportunities to speak to Americans\u2019 fears, spell out a different approach or set the record straight,\u201d Eilethee said. \u201cNow the real question is: how much does he seek these opportunities?\u201d</p>",

In terms of intensive care, we have doubled the capacity ... and there are beds available right now with the ventilators right now to deal with people if they require it. [Intensive care] is a very small component of those now 3,400 cases in Australia, as I mentioned. Only 30 in total. And less than that currently. </p> \n   <p>We will not be seeing a peak on the 10 April, as has been reported in some places. That is not the case. The other matter I would refer to, just in terms of cruise ships, there is an emerging issue off the coast of Western Australia at the moment in relation to several cruise ships, two in particular.<br></p> \n   <p>One is a local ship, the Vasco Da Gama. The other is the Artania, which mainly has people from Germany. There are people with Covid-19 on that ship and we are working as a federal government with the WA government very closely, as well as with the German government, to repatriate anyone who is fit to fly back to Germany and other places in Europe tomorrow.

  "<p>When the definitive history of the coronavirus pandemic is written, the date 20 January 2020 is certain to feature prominently. It was on that day that a 35-year-old man in Washington state, recently returned from visiting family in Wuhan in China, became the first person in the US to be <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191\">diagnosed</a> with the virus.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/27/new-york-coronavirus-help-de-blasio-urges-trump-us-hotspots-emerge\">New York mayor urges Trump to help as more US coronavirus hotspots emerge</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>On the very same day, 5,000 miles away in Asia, the first confirmed case of Covid-19 was <a href=\"https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200121-sitrep-1-2019-ncov.pdf?sfvrsn=20a99c10_4\">reported</a> in South Korea. The confluence was striking, but there the similarities ended.</p> \n<p>In the two months since that fateful day, the responses to coronavirus displayed by the US and South Korea have been polar opposites.</p> \n<p>One country acted swiftly and aggressively to detect and isolate the virus, and by doing so has largely contained the crisis. The other country dithered and procrastinated, became mired in chaos and confusion, was distracted by the individual whims of its leader, and is now confronted by a health emergency of daunting proportions.</p> \n<p>Within a week of its first confirmed case, South Korea\u2019s disease control agency had summoned 20 private companies to the medical equivalent of a war-planning summit and told them to develop a test for the virus at lightning speed. A week after that, the <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-testing-specialrep/special-report-how-korea-trounced-u-s-in-race-to-test-people-for-coronavirus-idUSKBN2153BW?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_source=twitter\">first diagnostic test</a> was approved and went into battle, identifying infected individuals who could then be quarantined to halt the advance of the disease.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1e9b8e382f2bd553dcf7afd55b54cde69b6f2e06\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e9b8e382f2bd553dcf7afd55b54cde69b6f2e06/0_0_8256_5504/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A nurse at testing booth outside the Yangji hospital in Seoul.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A nurse at testing booth outside the Yangji hospital in Seoul.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ed Jones/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Some 357,896 tests later, the country has more or less won the coronavirus war.

He has exacerbated the problems encountered by federal agencies by playing musical chairs at the top of the coronavirus force. </p> \n<p>The president began by creating on 29 January a special coronavirus taskforce, then gave Vice-President Mike Pence the job, who promptly <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/vice-president-pence-announces-ambassador-debbie-birx-serve-white-house-coronavirus-response-coordinator/\">appointed Deborah Birx</a> \u201ccoronavirus response coordinator\u201d, before the federal emergency agency Fema began taking charge of key areas, with <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/kushner-coronavirus-team-sparks-confusion-plaudits-inside-white-house-response-efforts/2020/03/18/02038a16-6874-11ea-9923-57073adce27c_story.html\">Jared Kushner</a>, the president\u2019s son-in-law, creating a shadow team that increasingly appears to be calling the shots.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s no point of responsibility,\u201d the former senior official told the Guardian. \u201cIt keeps shifting. Nobody owns the problem.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Trump: everything\u2019s going to be great</h2> \n<p>Amid the confusion, day-to-day management of the crisis has frequently come directly from Trump himself via his Twitter feed. The president, with more than half an eye on the New York stock exchange, has consistently talked down the scale of the crisis.</p> \n<p>On 30 January, as the World Health Organization was declaring a global emergency, Trump said: \u201cWe only have five people. Hopefully, everything\u2019s going to be great.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5b86d89c-98d6-4d80-ba4b-9c7affda275f\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NezEbDx4B9A?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>On 24 February, Trump claimed \u201cthe coronavirus is very much under control in the USA\u201d. The next day, Nancy Messonnier, the CDC\u2019s top official on respiratory diseases, took the radically different approach of <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2020/02/25/cdc-expects-community-spread-of-coronavirus-as-top-official-warns-disruptions-could-be-severe/\">telling the truth</a>, warning the American people that \u201cdisruption to everyday life might be severe\u201d.</p> \n<p>Trump was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/07/us/politics/trump-coronavirus.html\">reportedly</a> so angered by the comment and its impact on share prices that he shouted down the phone at Messonnier\u2019s boss, the secretary of health and human services, Alex Azar.</p> \n<p>\u201cMessonnier was 100% right. She gave a totally honest and accurate assessment,\u201d Konyndyk told the Guardian. And for that, Trump angrily rebuked her department. \u201cThat sent a very clear message about what is and isn\u2019t permissible to say.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b1a029b5b3129746e52d3c6295846e913d6c1f4e\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b1a029b5b3129746e52d3c6295846e913d6c1f4e/0_0_4416_2944/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Traders, some in medical masks, work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange last week.

That\u2019s when he began to despair about the federal handling of the crisis.</p> \n<p>\u201cI thought, \u2018Holy Jesus!\u2019 Where\u2019s the discussion on protecting our hospitals? Where\u2019s the discussion on high-risk populations, on surveillance so we can detect where the virus is. I knew then that the president had set the priority, the bureaucracy was following it, but it was the wrong priority.\u201d</p> \n<p>So it has transpired. In the wake of the testing disaster has come the personal protective equipment <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/coronavrirus-medical-staff-beg-for-masks-social-media\">(PPE) disaster</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/17/upshot/hospital-bed-shortages-coronavirus.html\">hospital bed disaster</a>, and now the <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-26/n-y-death-toll-up-to-385-ventilators-used-as-long-as-30-days\">ventilator disaster</a>.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/us/politics/coronavirus-ventilators.html\">Ventilators</a>, literal life preservers, are in dire short supply across the country. When governors begged Trump to unleash the full might of the US government on this critical problem, he gave his answer on 16 March.</p> \n<p>In a phrase that will stand beside 20 January 2020 as one of the most revelatory moments of the history of coronavirus, he said: \u201cRespirators, ventilators, all of the equipment \u2013 try getting it yourselves.\u201d</p> \n<p>To date, the Trump administration has supplied 400 ventilators to New York. By Cuomo\u2019s estimation, 30,000 are needed.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou want a pat on the back for sending 400 ventilators?\u201d Cuomo scathingly <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/sergeiklebnikov/2020/03/24/cuomo-mocks-fema-shipment-you-want-a-pat-on-the-back-for-sending-400-ventilators/#35884a3ca7b8\">asked on Tuesday</a>. He added: \u201cYou pick the 26,000 who are going to die because you only sent 400 ventilators.\u201d</p> \n<h2>\u2018A total vacuum of federal leadership\u2019</h2> \n<p>In the absence of a strong federal response, a patchwork of efforts has sprouted all across the country. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/27/us-governors-coronavirus-trump\">State governors</a> are doing their own thing. Cities, even individual hospitals, are coping as best they can.</p> \n<p>In an improvised attempt to address such inconsistencies, charitable startups have proliferated on social media. Konyndyk has clubbed together with fellow disaster relief experts to set up <a href=\"https://covidlocal.org/\">Covid Local</a>, an online \u201cquick and dirty\u201d guide to how to fight a pandemic.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are seeing the emergence of 50-state anarchy, because of a total vacuum of federal leadership. It\u2019s absurd that thinktanks and Twitter are providing more actionable guidance in the US than the federal government, but that\u2019s where we are.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/mar/27/coronavirus-and-volunteering-how-can-i-help-in-the-uk\">Coronavirus and volunteering: how can I help in the UK?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Valerie Griffeth is a founding member of another of the new online startups that are trying to fill the Trump void.

They resigned themselves to a terrible new reality.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe said to ourselves we are going to get exposed to the virus.

In a few moments I will request a vote on the CARES Act which means members of Congress will vote on it by pushing \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d or \u201cpresent.\u201d</p> \n   <p>The Constitution requires that a quorum of members be present to conduct business in the House. Right now, millions of essential, working-class Americans are still required to go to work during this pandemic such as manufacturing line workers, healthcare professionals, pilots, grocery clerks, cooks/chefs, delivery drivers, auto mechanics, and janitors (to name just a few). Is it too much to ask that the House do its job, just like the Senate did?</p> \n   <p>I am not delaying the bill like Nancy Pelosi did last week. The bill that was worked on in the Senate late last week was much better before Speaker Pelosi showed up to destroy it and add days and days to the process.</p> \n   <p>This bill should have been voted on much sooner in both the Senate and House and it shouldn\u2019t be stuffed full of Nancy Pelosi\u2019s pork \u2013 including $25 million for the Kennedy Center, grants for the National Endowment for the Humanities and Arts, and millions more other measures that have no direct relation to the Coronavirus Pandemic. </p> \n   <p>That $25 million, for example, should go directly to purchasing test kits. The number one priority of this bill should have been to expand testing availability and creation of tests so that every American, not just the wealthy and privileged, have access to testing. We have shut down the world\u2019s economy without adequate data. Everyone, even those with no symptoms, needs immediate access to a test. This bill creates even more secrecy around a Federal Reserve that still refuses to be audited. It allows the Federal Reserve to make decisions about who gets what, how much money we\u2019ll print. With no transparency.</p> \n   <p>If getting us into $6 trillion more debt doesn\u2019t matter, then why are we not getting $350 trillion more in debt so that we can give a check of $1 million to every person in the country?</p> \n   <p>This stimulus should go straight to the people rather than being funneled through banks and corporations like this bill is doing. 2 trillion divided by 150 million workers is about $13,333.00 per person.

She added in a statement on Friday: \u201cMuch more must be done. The president must use the full powers of this law to address the dire, widespread shortage of materials required to fight this pandemic, including diagnostic test supplies, masks and other personal protective equipment.\u201d</p> \n<p>Critics say Trump ignored early warnings about the threat of the pandemic and had he acted sooner, mass production of ventilators would now be well under way. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/us/politics/coronavirus-ventilators.html\">The New York Times reported</a> estimates that if the White House had reacted to the shortage in February, the private sector might have had them ready in mid- to late April; instead it is now unlikely to be before June.</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s call for the building of more ventilators comes one day after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/27/trump-ventilators-coronavirus-cuomo-new-york\">he expressed scepticism</a> about New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and medical experts\u2019 prediction that his state would need 30,000 to 40,000 ventilators when the coronavirus outbreak peaks there.</p> \n<p>On Friday Trump refused to back down on his comments, saying: \u201cI think their estimates are high. I hope they\u2019re high.\u201d</p> \n<p>He suggested the ventilators produced by GM and others would serve not only New York but other parts of the US was well as helping the UK, Italy, Germany and Spain. When he called Boris Johnson, the British prime minister, who has tested positive for the virus, Johnson immediately said, \u201cWe need ventilators,\u201d Trump recalled. \u201cWe\u2019ll take care of our needs but we\u2019re also going to take care of other countries.\u201d</p> \n<p>During Friday\u2019s briefing, Trump also lashed out at state governors. \u201cAll I want them to do, very simple, I want them to be appreciative. I don\u2019t want them to say things that aren\u2019t true. I want them to be appreciative.

But the idea of a vaccine \u2013 the quintessential silver bullet \u2013 has come to bear an almost unreasonable allure. The coronavirus arrived at a ripe moment in genetic technology, when the advances of the past half-decade have made it possible for vaccine projects to explode off the blocks as soon as a virus is sequenced. These cutting-edge vaccines don\u2019t use weakened forms of the germ to build our immunity, as all vaccines once did; rather, they contain short copies of parts of the germ\u2019s genetic code \u2013 its DNA or RNA \u2013 which can produce fragments of the germ within our bodies.</p> \n  <p>Thus, for the first time ever, scientists have been able to muster up vaccine prospects mere weeks into a new, fast-spreading disease. Right now, there are at least 43 Covid-19 vaccines <a href=\"https://milkeninstitute.org/sites/default/files/2020-03/Covid19%20Tracker%20032020v3-posting.pdf\">in development</a> around the world \u2013 in Brisbane and Hong Kong, in the US and the UK, in the labs of universities and companies. Most of these are DNA or RNA vaccines. One vaccine, made in 63 days by an American biotech firm named Moderna, <a href=\"https://www.niaid.nih.gov/news-events/nih-clinical-trial-investigational-vaccine-covid-19-begins\">moved into</a> human trials on 16 March, entering the bloodstream of the first of 45 healthy adult volunteers in Seattle. It was a \u201cworld indoor record\u201d, said Anthony Fauci, the doctor who heads the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. \u201cNothing has ever gone that fast.\u201d</p> \n

The idea is simple: there are businesses which will have to close their doors. They will have to keep them closed either because we have made it necessary for them to do so, or simply because there is just not the business to keep their doors open. We want those businesses to start again. And we do not want over the course of the next six months or as long as it takes, for those businesses to be so saddled by debt, so saddled by rental payments, so saddled by other liabilities that they will not be able to start again on the other side.

If you see news you think our readers should know, or something that might lower our collective stress levels for a moment, let me know on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/helenrsullivan\">@helenrsullivan</a>. </p> \n  <p>A lot has happened in the last few hours. Here are the main developments: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The US now has the highest number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the world.</strong> Johns Hopkins University suggests the US now has more suspected and confirmed cases of Covid-19 than China with 82,404 reported in the US and 81,782 in China. Italy is third with 80,589.</li> \n   <li><strong>The global number of confirmed cases of coronavirus has passed the half a million mark,</strong> according to the latest figures on the Johns Hopkins University global dashboard. The latest number of confirmed cases worldwide is 529,093.</li> \n   <li><strong>Leaders of the G20 industrialised nations committed to do \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to minimise the social and economic damage of the world-wide pandemic.</strong> But a largely unspecific and uncontroversial joint communique set no specific commitments such as deferring debt repayment to the world\u2019s poorest countries, as sought by the World Bank and the IMF.</li> \n   <li><strong>China has announced it will close its borders to foreign nationals from this weekend</strong>. Other measures include restricting foreign airlines to a single route, with no more than one weekly flight. Each Chinese airline is permitted one route to any specific country with no more than one flight a week.</li> \n   <li><strong>South Africa came under a nationwide military-patrolled lockdown on Friday, </strong>joining other African countries imposing strict curfews and shutdowns in an attempt to halt the spread of the coronavirus across the continent.Some 57 million people are to be restricted to their homes during South Africa\u2019s three-week total lockdown which began at midnight.</li> \n   <li><strong>Brita</strong><strong>in\u2019s prime minister, Boris Johnson, called on governments around the world to work together to create a vaccine</strong> as quickly as possible and make it available to anyone who needs it.</li> \n   <li><strong>The International Monetary Fund on Thursday asked G20 leaders to back a doubling of its emergency financing capacity</strong> to strengthen its response to the rapidly spreading coronavirus pandemic that is set to cause a global recession in 2020.</li> \n   <li><strong>France </strong><strong>began evacuating coronavirus patients from Alsace using a special high-speed train.</strong> About 20 patients were taken from Strasbourg to hospitals in the Pays-de-la-Loire and other regions. The move is aimed at relieving pressure on hospitals overwhelmed in Alsace.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>The WHO said it sees \u2018encouraging signs\u2019 in Europe. </strong>The World Health Organiszation says it is encouraged by the lower rate of new infection in Italy. </li> \n   <li><strong>A slower rise in deaths was reported in Spain. </strong>Spain has announced anothera further 655 coronavirus fatalities, taking the country\u2019s total to more than 4,000. As the increase is below the daily rise recorded on Wednesday it offers support to government claims that the rise is deaths in Spain is stabilising.</li> \n   <li><strong>India announced a stimulus package. </strong>India has announced a 1.7tn-rupee (\u00a318.9bn) economic stimulus plan to millions of people, affected by a nationwide lockdown. </li> \n   <li><strong>Iran posted a record rise in cases. </strong>The health ministry confirmed another 157 deaths from the virus in the last 24 hours, taking Iran\u2019s total to 2,234 fatalities. A record 2,389 new cases had been recorded over the same period. Five days ago, the numbers being infected daily was below 900.</li> \n   <li><strong>The UK recorded its biggest daily rise in deaths.</strong> The number of people who have died from coronavirus in UK hospitals has risen by 115 in a single day to 578, as of 5pm on Thursday. It is the biggest daily rise in deaths across the country since the outbreak began.</li> \n   <li><strong>Moscow shut down as Russia banned flights. </strong>Moscow announced it would close restaurants, bars, parks, and shops other than grocery stores and pharmacies. It came as Russia posted record growth for confirmed coronavirus cases for the second day in a row.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-27T00:13:49.778Z\">at 12.13am GMT</time></p> \n</div>"
