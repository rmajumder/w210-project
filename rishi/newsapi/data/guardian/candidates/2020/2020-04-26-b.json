  "<p>So concludes the election campaign to be World Rugby\u2019s top dog. Voting has begun, though we will not know for sure whether Bill Beaumont or Agust\u00edn Pichot has prevailed for more than two weeks. There are, of course, mitigating circumstances but, as convoluted processes go, you might have thought lessons would be learned from the contest to host the 2023 World Cup (more on that later).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/23/european-clubs-collision-course-world-rugby-unacceptable-fixture-plans\">European clubs on collision course with World Rugby over 'unacceptable' plans</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It may yet prove to be the smoothest of ballots, but a fortnight is a long time in sports politics. That the vote is secret and heavily weighted so that the Six Nations countries each get three votes, Fiji or the USA one, serves only to muddy the waters further.</p> <p>On to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/21/world-rugby-administration-needs-to-work-many-not-few\">candidates</a> and Beaumont has had a trying couple of weeks, what with his campaign being backed by a convicted killer who has been condemned by Amnesty International. The Fiji rugby union chairman, Francis Kean, has been denied a visa for the US but astonishingly he emerged as a key supporter of Beaumont\u2019s bid. It is just one of this campaign\u2019s great ironies that a key part of Sir Bill\u2019s manifesto is a fit and proper persons test for elected officials.</p> <p>To briefly recap, Beaumont has been nominated by France and seconded by Fiji. In turn, Bernard Laporte, who is running unopposed as his vice-chairman, has been nominated by the Rugby Football Union while Kean was seconded by France for a role on World Rugby\u2019s executive committee. This was all announced nearly two weeks ago but then fresh allegations of homophobia by Kean came to light and Beaumont had to act, with Fiji pressured to stand down Kean from the World Rugby council and the election. Meanwhile, Fiji\u2019s vote falls to Frank Bainimarama, the president of the union and who happens to be Kean\u2019s brother-in-law and his country\u2019s prime minister. Bainimarama, lest we forget, took charge of the country in 2006 via military coup.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5e2524fe8d7e6b76a1fd9a7f01734fd102646d0d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e2524fe8d7e6b76a1fd9a7f01734fd102646d0d/0_68_3504_2102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Agust\u00edn Pichot in action for Argentina at Twickenham in 2011.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Agust\u00edn Pichot in action for Argentina at Twickenham in 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Hevezi/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is against this backdrop that Beaumont has also had to deal with the white knight in white trainers coming up the rails. Pichot has portrayed himself as the underdog but he has gathered late momentum. For this is an election fought on the north-south divide, the traditionalist Beaumont against the revolutionary Pichot, the dinosaur versus the dynamo. Accordingly, Beaumont has undergone a bit of a rebrand, trying to come across as a bit more avuncular. Pichot has called for a new rugby computer game to spin the world game on its axis, Beaumont insists: \u201cI\u2019m not bad with modern technology.\u201d You get the gist.</p> <p>While Beaumont has the backing of the European stronghold, Pichot has the Sanzaar votes and has been canvassing for the support of the tier two nations. This new radical wants to shake up the existing order. Indeed, Pichot wants to spread the British &amp; Irish Lions gospel in the Americas. That\u2019s Argentina\u2019s Pichot, who was appointed to the USA Rugby board in late 2018.</p> <p>There is also the matter of the 2027 World Cup. Argentina had been expected to bid but Pichot recently revealed that was no longer the case and instead the union would be getting behind Australia. Pichot\u2019s nomination in the election was seconded by Rugby Australia. It is only a couple of years ago that RA was furious to learn of his<a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/sport/rugby-union/twiggy-recruits-world-rugby-deputy-to-head-mining-push-in-argentina-20180816-p4zxwd.html\"> relationship with the Australian iron ore billionaire Andrew \u2018Twiggy\u2019 Forrest</a> \u2013 the brains behind the rebel World Series Rugby competition.</p> <p>Indeed, eyebrows were raised when he appointed Pichot, not previously famous for being an expert in the field, as head of his South American mining operation. So much so that one of RA\u2019s leading officials, Brett Robinson,<a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/sport/rugby-union/twiggy-recruits-world-rugby-deputy-to-head-mining-push-in-argentina-20180816-p4zxwd.html\"> reportedly demanded that Pichot declare his conflict of interest</a> to World Rugby. It seems the pair have made up, however, because Robinson\u2019s nomination to World Rugby\u2019s executive committee was seconded by the Argentinian union.</p> <p>Beaumont and Pichot have spent the past four years as chairman and vice-chairman respectively, but this election battle has long since been coming. According to one well-placed source, they were \u201cwatching each other\u2019s every move\u201d throughout the Japan World Cup and their manifestos do not differ greatly from each other. But while Pichot has decided to go it alone, Beaumont has enlisted Laporte\u2019s services. And Laporte is a political animal.</p> <p>It was he who, despite an official recommendation that South Africa should be awarded the 2023 World Cup, convinced the voters to plump for France. It seems likely Laporte fancies a crack at the top job, a year after delivering that tournament, and while that 2023 fiasco came at great embarrassment to Beaumont, clearly he recognised the Frenchman\u2019s influence. Indeed, it was Laporte who almost convinced the uber-conservative Six Nations to back the Nations Championship proposal.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/21/world-rugby-administration-needs-to-work-many-not-few\">Trad turkeys of World Rugby unlikely to vote for Christmas on election day</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Having Laporte as his No 2 has not been without its difficulties, however. There is his role in the Kean affair and Beaumont was also forced to row back on Laporte\u2019s recent claims that World Rugby would run a proposed Club World Cup and the Champions Cup would be ditched as a result. It is unlikely that was a slip of the tongue by Laporte who, crucially, understands the balance of power within the global game and just how much of it lies with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/25/premiership-rugby-union-clubs-in-danger-funding-shortfall-from-paused-season\">clubs in England</a> and France.</p> <p>We have heard plenty about a new-found cooperation between unions and clubs in recent weeks, but already the cracks are beginning to show. World Rugby wants to play Tests in October, the European clubs have balked at the idea. The best way to interpret Laporte\u2019s comments is as planting a flag, the Frenchman aware that the coronavirus crisis has rendered the clubs weaker than usual. Because, for all that Beaumont and Pichot have both promised change, it will only happen with the say-so of the clubs, regardless of whoever accrues most votes on 12 May.</p>",
  "<p>For almost six years now, a network of volunteers in Europe and Africa have been providing a service that some of the world\u2019s wealthiest countries have chosen not to. When migrants get into distress in the Mediterranean, they can call <a href=\"https://alarmphone.org/en/\">Alarm Phone</a>\u2019s emergency number; the call is relayed by a team of people spread across France, Tunisia, Italy, Germany, the UK, Morocco and elsewhere to the coastguard service nearest the boat.</p> <p>On the night of 10 April, Alarm Phone received a call from one of 63 people on board a rubber boat drifting between Libya, Italy and Malta that was slowly filling up with water.<a href=\"https://alarmphone.org/en/2020/04/16/twelve-deaths-and-a-secret-push-back-to-libya/\"> According to Alarm Phone</a>, the EU was aware of the boat but Malta, the country that should have been responsible for rescuing it, held off until the migrants could be returned to Libya, where torture and other forms of mistreatment are well documented. The boat drifted for five days, during which time five people died of thirst, according to survivors, and another seven people went missing, presumed drowned.</p> <p>Malta\u2019s prime minister, Robert Abela, is now<a href=\"https://www.thejournal.ie/malta-prime-minister-migrant-deaths-5078016-Apr2020/\"> under police investigation</a> for the incident but remains defiant: \u201cMy conscience is clear because we have done everything in our power to protect our people and all those who live in this country,\u201d he said, explaining that Malta\u2019s ports were closed during the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cIn a health emergency, this country is not a safe port for migrants.\u201d</p> <p>To many people, this logic \u2013 we must look after our own \u2013 will seem unassailable, despite the costs. Malta is not the only country to shut off help to vulnerable migrants during the pandemic: Italy has also<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/italy-declares-own-ports-unsafe-to-stop-migrants-disembarking\"> closed its ports</a>, while the UK <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/12/patel-refuses-to-take-children-from-greek-camps-threatened-by-covid-19\">declines to evacuate</a> refugee children with relatives in Britain from unsanitary Greek camps, and the US has <a href=\"https://apnews.com/7e9426532434bdda47f270a57d091c91\">quietly suspended</a> its entire asylum system. Earlier this month, nearly 400 Rohingya refugees were found starving on a boat near Malaysia, which had reportedly <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-52305931\">cited the pandemic</a> as a reason not to take them in.</p> <p>Temporary limits on movement \u2013 within countries and cities, as well as internationally \u2013 are regarded by most public health experts as an essential part of the fight against the coronavirus. But the overriding message from leading scientists has been that this needs to be based on a system of testing and contact tracing that tracks the spread of the virus, rather than blanket assumptions about foreigners and other outsiders. If clampdowns on national borders are offered as a substitute for more meaningful forms of protection then everybody loses.</p> <p>In recent years, as rightwing populism has become a defining political force in many parts of the world, the demand for tougher border control has come to stand in for a range of wider anxieties about identity, culture and economic security. The political theorist Wendy Brown links this to decades of neoliberal policies that have allowed finance-driven global capitalism to undermine wages, infrastructure and social security in wealthy countries; her book<a href=\"https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/walled-states-waning-sovereignty\"> Walled States, Waning Sovereignty</a> suggests that the politically potent image of the border wall has come to stand in for security that the state no longer provides.</p> <p>Nowhere does this seem more apt today than the US. Universal healthcare and comprehensive unemployment support is anathema to much of the political elite; what they have instead is a president who grandstands about flight bans and protecting Americans<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/apr/21/trump-us-immigration-ban-pause-green-cards\"> from being \u201creplaced\u201d</a> in their jobs by immigrants even as he actively undermines domestic social distancing policies and efforts to source vital medical equipment. But the impulse is present in Europe too: as the coronavirus arrived on the continent the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/28/coronavirus-outbreak-migrants-blamed-italy-matteo-salvini-marine-le-pen\"> first response of many rightwing populists</a> was to attack refugee policy and the EU\u2019s internal free movement rules. Some of these voices<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/01/populist-right-coronavirus\"> have, for the moment, been dimmed</a> as many citizens prioritise the advice of scientific experts in a time of medical emergency.</p> <p>If the border is a dominant symbol of national welfare, it is not the only one. In the UK, while a vocal minority on the right<a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/03/30/course-must-stop-coronavirus-not-cost-becoming-police-state/\"> continues to play on this theme</a> in order to attack domestic lockdown measures, it has been eclipsed by the call to rally around the NHS. There is no more powerful symbol of collective good in the British political lexicon; not even politicians who oppose the principle of socialised medicine dare say so openly. It sits at the heart of the government\u2019s call to action: <em>stay home, protect the NHS, save lives</em>.</p> <p>The solidarity expressed by millions of people at a moment of crisis is an amazing thing. As in other afflicted countries, the vast majority of the UK\u2019s population have made huge, largely voluntary changes to their lives for collective benefit. But our desire for security can nonetheless be pushed in an exclusionary direction. \u201cIt\u2019s the national health service, not the international health service,\u201d<a href=\"https://twitter.com/matthancock/status/1195997609942560768\"> wrote</a> the health secretary Matt Hancock during last year\u2019s general election campaign, promising to extend the health surcharge to non-resident EU citizens after Brexit.</p> <p>Over the past decade, as the strength of the NHS has been depleted by austerity economics, along with other public services, the right has pushed the claim that foreigners are an unacceptable drain on the state, accompanied by a host of bureaucratic measures \u2013 charges, restrictions, surveillance, punishment \u2013 to police their activities even as the rest of society benefits from their labour. It is no small irony that as Britain expresses a newfound gratitude to the immigrants that help keep the NHS and other key services running, the Home Office is<a href=\"https://twitter.com/MayaGoodfellow/status/1252550524790018048\"> fighting to maintain</a> many of its notorious hostile environment policies.</p> <p>Once the pandemic subsides, and we are left to deal with the social and economic upheaval in its wake, nationalist demands for wealthy countries to turn inwards are likely to intensify. These may well start with demands to exclude outsiders but they are likely to turn on \u201cundeserving\u201d citizens too. Events in the Mediterranean may seem distant from many everyday concerns right now, but the way our governments treat people in need is the defining question of our time. If you want to see what happens when death and suffering are swept under the carpet and rendered acceptable by political euphemism and omission, then the frontiers of the rich world are a useful place to start. This is a planetary crisis, not a national one, and it is vital that we do not allow our respect for human life to end at the border.</p> <p>\u2022 Daniel Trilling is the author of Lights in the Distance: Exile and Refuge at the Borders of Europe</p>",
  "<p>Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1986 wisecrack \u2013 \u201cThe nine most terrifying words in the English language are: I\u2019m from the government and I\u2019m here to help\u201d \u2013 would not get a lot of laughs today. In much of the world, people are desperate for the government to show up and rise to the challenge of the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>Reagan\u2019s attitude to government solidified into orthodoxy for more than three decades, spreading abroad \u2013 particularly in the UK with the help of Margaret Thatcher \u2013 and captured the centre ground of politics in both countries.</p> <p>The antipathy to the state was selective: Reagan, like Donald Trump today, racked up huge deficits, spent heavily on defence and built up a system of corporate welfare through subsidies and tax breaks. But on both sides of the Atlantic, the prevailing wisdom was the state should wherever possible get out of the business of trying to control inequality and provide services to the less fortunate.</p> <p>There are already some signs that the Covid-19 shock may challenge those attitudes. Disease and mass unemployment have always been far better recruiting sergeants for the cause of big government than any party manifesto \u2013 and this crisis is unlikely to be an exception.</p> <p>Some social scientists and historians argue that this pandemic could become a turning point in social history \u2013 on a par with the New Deal in the US or the post-war Labour government in the UK.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been on this kind of trajectory for last 30-odd years where the individual was taking priority over the collective. And now we\u2019re actually back into the kind of spirit that our parents and grandparents lived through in which communities have to pull together,\u201d Fiona Hill, a British-born historian who served on Trump\u2019s national security council.</p> <p>Hill pointed to the UK, where 750,000 people <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/13/a-million-volunteer-to-help-nhs-and-others-during-covid-19-lockdown\">signed up as volunteers for the National Health Service (NHS)</a> and a wave of climate activism on both sides of the Atlantic.</p> <p>\u201cI do think there is a huge appetite among younger people, trying to get more government action.

He said: \u201cWhat we would actually face in the US is an ever-increasing discrepancy between the demand for change, and the total absence of change.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Long before Joe Biden became the presumptive Democratic nominee, he was welcoming recommendations for his vice-presidential running mate. At campaign rallies, town halls and, more recently, virtual fundraisers, Biden has gamely engaged the subject, answering questions about his search, naming potential contenders and describing in detail what he is looking for in a partner, and, potentially, a successor.</p> \n<p>His approach is unusual. The process of selecting a running mate is typically shrouded in deep secrecy. But, as Biden likes to remind voters, it\u2019s a role he knows intimately.

Covid-19 has revived the storyline. But now it\u2019s not so funny.</p> <p>Around the world, authoritarian leaders are exploiting, exacerbating or grossly mishandling the response to the pandemic, placing selfish interest ahead of public good.</p> <p>They are mostly male. Their behaviour is frequently appalling.

Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel, New Zealand\u2019s Jacinda Ardern, and Taiwan\u2019s Tsai Ing-wen are among competent and compassionate women singled out for praise.</p> <p>Yet do the worst-performing leaders share dysfunctional characteristics beyond mere maleness? A war fixation is one. Poverty of imagination is another. They routinely trot out tired martial metaphors and cliches such as \u201cwartime president\u201d, \u201cblitz spirit\u201d, and \u201cfighting the invisible enemy\u201d.</p> <p>Lack of empathy also seems to be a common denominator, even among self-styled \u201cman of the people\u201d populists.

His initial response to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/turkeys-covid-19-infection-rate-rising-fastest-in-the-world\">growing Covid-19 threat</a> was to put the economy before lives. Erdogan is accused, like Trump, of politicising the crisis, for example by banning fundraising efforts by opposition-controlled city councils in Istanbul, Izmir, and Ankara. The impressive performance of Istanbul\u2019s mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu, a possible 2023 presidential rival, is said to worry him more than the disease.</p> <p>Rushed curfews and protective measures have caused confusion and panic-buying. And Erdogan fumbled a chance to foster unity of purpose when an early release of prisoners excluded jailed political opponents, journalists and human rights activists.<br><br>The world expects better of Turkey. In the Philippines, the macho antics of Rodrigo Duterte, a president notorious for celebrating extrajudicial murder, are par for the course. Like right-wingers elsewhere, Duterte minimised the Covid-19 threat, then over-reacted.</p> <p>A typically heavy-handed clampdown has followed belated lockdown measures. Duterte ordered the police and military to kill those who did not comply. \u201cShoot them dead,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/04/poverty-punished-philippines-tough-virus-pandemic-200413063921536.html\">he urged</a>. \u201cInstead of causing trouble, I\u2019ll send you to the grave.\u201d</p> <p>Duterte\u2019s assumption of emergency powers mirrors power-grabs in other countries with weak systems of democratic accountability. Hungary\u2019s rightwing populist leader, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, says his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/hungary-jail-for-coronavirus-misinformation-viktor-orban\">new power to rule indefinitely</a> by decree can be revoked any time. Opponents fear a tame parliament may never do so.</p> <p>Some of the world\u2019s most authoritarian leaders have reacted with a morbid mix of crass irresponsibility and calculation. Jair Bolsonaro, Brazil\u2019s president, <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/04/20/brazil-jair-bolsonaro-coronavirus-denialism-fire-mandetta-mourao-wont-hurt-him/\">appears to hope</a>, Trump-like, that he can turn the poor\u2019s hostility to job-destroying lockdowns to political advantage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6660836db4c2e7e136a4dab7c3165663591b400b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6660836db4c2e7e136a4dab7c3165663591b400b/0_0_3203_2185/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police check the temperature of motorcyclists in Manila on Friday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"682\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police check the temperature of motorcyclists in Manila on Friday.

If Brazil\u2019s economy implodes, Bolsonaro, weirdly, could be the gainer \u2013 unless he is impeached first.</p> <p>China\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, is also using the pandemic for political ends, as evidenced by the opportunistic arrest last week of 15 veteran Hong Kong pro-democracy figures. Virus-related security and economic fears <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/fresh-hong-kong-crackdown-will-result-in-deaths-says-democracy-leader-martin-lee\">are being exploited</a> to justify an ever tighter crackdown after last year\u2019s failure to halt anti-Beijing protests.<br><br>But the hard men are not having it all their own way. Xi\u2019s carefully nurtured reputation for quasi-celestial infallibility has taken a knock in the wake of the Wuhan disaster. The shine is also coming off India\u2019s Hindu nationalist prime minister, Narendra Modi.</p> <p>Modi seemed to carry all before him last year, especially following the Kashmir crackdown. A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/01/india-delhi-after-hindu-mob-riot-religious-hatred-nationalists\">brutal anti-Muslim pogrom</a> in Delhi barely dented his domestic standing. But self-inflicted economic and social damage arising from clumsy, chaotic anti-virus measures are painting a less flattering portrait of incompetence and irrelevance.<br><br>Likewise the credibility of Vladimir Putin, the Russian president who specialises in exporting lethal germs, is in question after a slow start to the fightback.</p> <p>Shielding himself from harm, he-man Putin <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/04/20/russias-coronavirus-outbreak-why-it-could-be-bad-news-for-president-putin.html\">looks on impotently</a> as Russia\u2019s coronavirus caseload spirals upwards and the global oil price, key source of Kremlin cash, goes the other way.<br><br>In contrast, the pandemic has saved Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, from deserved oblivion. After a third, inconclusive election, and with a corruption trial looming, Netanyahu looked dead and buried. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/netanyahu-and-gantz-agree-to-form-unity-israeli-government\">His resurrection</a> is largely due to unscrupulous use of the virus threat as a national rallying cause.<br><br>Faced by all this bad behaviour, despair is an option. As Eliot wrote in<em> </em>The Hollow Men, \u201cThis is the way the world ends/ Not with a bang but with a whimper\u201d. And yet, perhaps not.</p> <p>Progressives can take comfort from the way autocrats and rightwing populists have mostly flunked the Covid-19 challenge. Maybe people around the world, shocked by all the high-handed bungling, will begin to resist and reverse the recent trend towards authoritarianism.</p> <p>It would be reassuring to think so. On the whole, democracies have behaved better during the crisis. But the UK and US responses have been dismal. Maybe that\u2019s because, in both cases, a certain kind of shallow, arrogant man is in charge.</p>",

  "<p>There have not been too many encouraging graph lines in recent weeks. One that does offer a breath of optimism, however, is the slight downward curve that implies one of the most toxic trends of our times \u2013 the anti-vaxx movement \u2013 might just be in retreat. The shift is incremental, but in a UK-wide survey in mid-March, 7% of people insisted they would refuse to have a coronavirus vaccine if one were available. By early April, with hospital wards and mortuaries filling up, that number had dropped to 5%. Perhaps vaccine conspiracy cannot bear too much pandemic reality.</p> <p>As with the strategies against the virus itself, however, the response to any likely \u201ccure\u201d seems likely to vary from country to country. A similar survey in France, also conducted by the London-based <a href=\"https://www.vaccineconfidence.org/\">Vaccine Confidence Project</a>, suggested 18% of people would refuse a vaccine, while in a poll in New York, the city worst affected by the pandemic, 29% insisted they would not consent, a number that may render any programme ineffective.</p> <p>The depth of misplaced fear about vaccination \u2013 which remains one of the unambiguous triumphs of global public health \u2013 has been further illustrated in widely shared remarks from lockdown. Novak Djokovic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/19/novak-djokovic-coronavirus-covid-19-vaccination-tennis\">last week volunteered</a> that he would have to think seriously about whether he could even carry on playing tennis if a vaccine were to become mandatory to travel. The rapper MIA went further in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/22/mia-claims-british-vogue-pulled-article-about-her-over-anti-vax-comments\">informing her 650,000 Twitter followers</a> melodramatically, that \u201cif I have to choose the vaccine or a [location-tracking] chip, I\u2019m gonna choose death\u201d.</p> <p>The most prominent American anti-vaxxer, Robert Kennedy Jr, meanwhile, amplified an unhinged conspiracy that believes Bill Gates is using the virus as part of a supposed plot to control the world\u2019s population through immunisation.</p> <p>All pandemics trail a ready market in superstition, quackery and prejudice \u2013 a sense of powerlessness generates in some the need for catch-all theories, however deranged. At the time of the great plague in London, the spread of miracle cures and scapegoating prophecy was almost harder to contain than the infection itself. As part of its strategy the government was moved, <a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/376/376-h/376-h.htm\">Daniel Defoe reported</a> in his <em>A Journal of the Plague Year</em>, to \u201csuppress the printing of such Books and Pamphlets as terrify the People\u201d. The efforts to prevent the spread of damaging conspiracies across our own media have shared a similar profile \u2013 and often a similar success rate \u2013 to the efforts to curb the disease.</p> <p>In this respect, the pandemic is something of a test case for the social media monopolies of Silicon Valley to deliver on their widely trumpeted commitment to slow the spread of dangerously false information. After being confronted with the evidence of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/nov/10/facebook-fake-news-election-conspiracy-theories\">manipulation in the elections of 2016</a>, and the spread of such vile conspiracies as that which argued that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/31/alex-jones-pay-sandy-hook-conspiracy-theory\">Sandy Hook massacre was a hoax</a>, Facebook and Google and the rest have been forced to step up efforts to monitor and block extreme misinformation campaigns on their various platforms. Arguably, that effort is finally starting to show some effect.</p> <p>Counterintuitively, some evidence for that might be found in the response to the most pernicious of the current conspiracies which has, entirely without scientific foundation, sought to link the spread of coronavirus with the rollout of the 5G data network. The real-world effects have been the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/04/uk-phone-masts-attacked-amid-5g-coronavirus-conspiracy-theory\">acts of vandalism and arson</a> against mobile phone masts in the past weeks.

Nah, I thought at the time; it will never catch on.</p> <p>In the 14 years since, it has become second nature to trace the originators of particularly incendiary memes. <a href=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/5g-coronavirus-conspiracy-theory\">A story in </a><em><a href=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/5g-coronavirus-conspiracy-theory\">Wired </a></em><a href=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/5g-coronavirus-conspiracy-theory\">magazine</a> located the origin of the 5G conspiracy in an interview of 22 January in a Belgian newspaper with Kris Van Kerckhoven, a general practitioner from Putte, near Antwerp. He was quoted as saying that \u201c5G is life-threatening\u201d, but then added a speculative comment (\u201cI have not done a fact-check\u201d) that linked that falsehood to the virus then confined to China. The \u201clink\u201d became an ill-advised clickbait headline. (The piece, in <em>Het Laatste Nieuws</em>, was subsequently withdrawn.)</p> <p>If these words marked the moment when the 5G conspiracy established its RNA, however, the \u201cwet market\u201d for those ideas to jump species and spread human to human was a conference given on 11 March at the Health and Human Rights Summit, in Tucson, Arizona. The headline act was the original anti-vaxxer Andrew Wakefield, the discredited English doctor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/may/24/mmr-doctor-andrew-wakefield-struck-off\">who was struck off</a> by the GMC after being shown to have deliberately falsified evidence to make bogus claims of a link between the MMR vaccine and autism. Wakefield was in this case upstaged by a Californian, Thomas Cowan, author of <em>Cancer and the New Biology of Water</em>, who is serving a five-year suspension from medical practice for prescribing unlicensed drugs to cancer patients. Cowan claimed, entirely falsely, that Covid-19 was caused by electromagnetic waves and, also incorrectly, that Wuhan, where it originated, had been the guinea-pig city for 5G.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/04/uk-phone-masts-attacked-amid-5g-coronavirus-conspiracy-theory\">UK phone masts attacked amid 5G-coronavirus conspiracy theory</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Videos of this talk were viewed 1.8 million times on YouTube and widely shared on Facebook before the sites moved to take the posts down.</p> <p>In their book <em>A Lot of People Are Saying</em>, their study of conspiracism in the Trump era, Russell Muirhead and Nancy Rosenblum classify people such as Cowan as \u201cconspiracy entrepreneurs\u201d.

Their combination with media attention around the decision to allow Huawei to supply some of the UK\u2019s 5G infrastructure, and the fact that telecoms engineers were designated key workers, appears to have ignited dangerous lockdown fears. Challenges were laid down in Facebook groups and Reddit threads for \u201cfirestarters\u201d to \u201ctake the 5G out\u201d.</p> <p>Social media platforms, fearing sanction, took long overdue action. Facebook has accepted a responsibility <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/12/facebook-acts-to-halt-far-right-groups-linking-covid-19-to-5g\">to remove false claims</a> that 5G technology causes Covid-19, while promising a modification that will direct people who look for such content toward accurate information from the NHS and the WHO.</p> <p>Some of the belated efforts to police \u201calt-right\u201d conspiracy content in the past couple of years are also helping to contain the spread of the madness. There has been no more virulent \u201cconspiracy entrepreneur\u201d than Alex Jones and his web channel, InfoWars. Jones has predictably loud-hailered the 5G and anti-vaxx lines: \u201cThis is the plan, folks,\u201d he grunted at his viewers. \u201cThey plan \u2013 if they\u2019ve fluoridated you and vaccinated you and stunned you and mesmerized you with the TV and put you in a trance \u2013 on killing you.\u201d Meanwhile, \u201cthey\u201d were determined \u201cto make sure you don\u2019t learn about the known antivirals\u201d. Prominent among these, apparently, were Jones\u2019s own \u201cwellness\u201d products: SuperSilver Whitening Toothpaste and ABL Nano Silver Gargle which, he claimed, \u201ckills the sars-corona family at point-blank range\u201d. (The only scientifically proven effect of the active ingredient in these products, <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/does-colloidal-silver-work/\">colloidal silver</a>, is that it turns your skin blue.)</p> <p>Up until last year Jones\u2019s vicious untruths would have been spread by millions of followers on YouTube and Facebook and Twitter.

For Trump and his minions, Virgil\u2019s take became a touchstone.</p> <p>Enter the New Yorker\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/contributors/david-rohde\">David Rohde</a>. Under the subtitle \u201cThe FBI, the CIA, and the Truth About America\u2019s \u2018Deep State\u2019\u201d, the two-time Pulitzer-winner rejects the nomenclature of conspiracy theorists. In doing so he relies in part on Will Hurd, a moderate Republican congressman from Texas who served overseas with the CIA, opposed impeachment and is not seeking re-election.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Trump placing his hand on the shoulder of an FBI director and whispering into his ear is the stuff of Scorsese\u2019s films</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But Rohde does little to dispel the notion that government is riddled with entrenched interests, and that career officials can find themselves at odds with incumbent presidents and vice versa. In Rohde\u2019s view, civil servants are part of \u201c\u2018institutional government\u2019\u201d, a relatively benign term that masks turf fights, budget battles, policy skirmishes, built-in biases and well-formed points of view. The left has frequently derided the military industrial complex. Name-calling plays both ways.</p> <p>Rohde acknowledges that \u201call countries have permanent governments\u201d, but says the US imposes greater political control over its employees and the resultant process. Even so, campaign finance records reflect that the federal bureaucracy is not a Republican bastion.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-taxonomy-of-scandals-is-obama-nearing-a-breaking-point\">Going back in time</a>, in 2012 Internal Revenue Service employees donated to Barack Obama over Mitt Romney by a 4\u20131 ratio while lawyers at the National Labor Relations Board and the education department <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-age-of-obama-a-strong-government-and-a-weak-america\">shut out Romney completely</a>. In 2020, Joe Biden is outpacing Trump at the IRS and the justice department, as Hillary Clinton did in 2016.</p> <p>Of course, who joins the federal government is not necessarily in sync with who prevails on election day. But the Trump presidency appears unique and disheartening. The fight between the president and law enforcement and intelligence was an avoidable consequence of Russia\u2019s \u201cactive measures\u201d <a href=\"https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Report_Volume4.pdf\">in support of the Trump campaign</a>, and a candidate all too willing to accept the sordid bounty.</p> <p>\u201cI love WikiLeaks\u201d was bound to gain attention. And as Rohde makes clear, Trump has waged a persistent assault upon the rule of law, the ideal of a justice department removed from politics and the concept of an intelligence community loyal to the country rather than the man in the Oval Office.</p> <p>A recent Senate intelligence committee report <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/21/us/politics/russian-interference-senate-intelligence-report.html\">observed</a> that the intelligence community has \u201cpresent[ed] a coherent and well-constructed intelligence basis for the case of unprecedented Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election\u201d. As Robert Mueller reminded us, absence of indictment was not akin to prosecutorial absolution, despite what <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/01/20/william-barr-trumps-sword-and-shield\">the attorney </a><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/01/20/william-barr-trumps-sword-and-shield\">general, William Barr</a>, may have thought and said.</p> <p>On that score, <a href=\"https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/6805-judge-walton-ruling-on-barr-cr/2df9b5c6d7de0fef1e35/optimized/full.pdf#page=1\">in an opinion issued last month</a> Reggie Walton, a George W Bush appointee to the federal bench, \u201cseriously\u201d questioned Barr\u2019s integrity and credibility, using words like \u201cdistorted\u201d and \u201cmisleading\u201d to drive the point home.</p> <p>Suffice to say, all this is coming with a steep cost to our democracy and our post-Watergate system, which sought to make law enforcement something other than the handmaiden of the White House. Trump placing his hand on the shoulder of an FBI director and whispering into his ear is the stuff of Martin Scorsese\u2019s films. \u201cLock her up\u201d is chant befitting a democracy in decay \u2013 or worse.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In Deep also pays attention to the Trump administration\u2019s privatization of foreign policy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Rohde, however, reminds us that Trump\u2019s predecessor was by no means angelic when it came to encroachment on civil liberties, despite stints on the Harvard Law Review and as a professor of constitutional law at the University of Chicago.
