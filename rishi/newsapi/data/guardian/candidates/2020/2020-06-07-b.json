  "<p>A senior editor at the New York Times has resigned amid a furious backlash over the newspaper\u2019s publication of a controversial and unfiltered comment piece penned by a Republican senator.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/opinion/tom-cotton-protests-military.html\">The article</a> by Tom Cotton, junior senator for Arkansas and a fierce ally of Donald Trump, titled Send in the Troops, called for the president to invoke the Insurrection Act of 1807 and use US military forces against citizens to quell unrest sparked by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">death of George Floyd</a>.</p> <p>In the days following its publication on 3 June, numerous current and former Times journalists <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jun/03/new-york-times-op-ed-tom-cotton-backlash-staff\">criticised the decision to run it</a> and the newspaper added a note to the essay on 5 June conceding it \u201cfell short of our standards and should not have been published\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jun/05/new-york-times-says-tom-cotton-opinion-piece-did-not-meet-editorial-standards\">New York Times says senator Tom Cotton's op-ed did not meet editorial standards</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On Sunday, the Times <a href=\"https://www.nytco.com/press/james-bennet-resigns-as-editorial-page-editor-of-the-new-york-times-katie-kingsbury-named-acting-editorial-page-editor/\">announced</a> that James Bennet, its editorial page director since May 2016, had resigned with immediate effect, and that one of his deputy editors, Jim Dao, had been reassigned to the newsroom.&nbsp;</p> <p>The announcement gave no explanation for Bennet\u2019s resignation or Dao\u2019s transfer, but the news drew swift comment from Trump, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1269733556865118211\">who tweeted</a> that the opinion editor had \u201cquit over the excellent Op-Ed penned by our great Senator @TomCottonAR.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThe New York Times is fake news,\u201d the president added, repeating a familiar claim.</p> <p>Cotton <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TomCottonAR/status/1269732987660312579\">also weighed in,</a> accusing the Times of lying and smearing his character. Cotton claimed he had not called for troops to be used against protesters but should be called on as a back-up \u201conly if police are overwhelmed\u201d.</p> <p>Earlier in the day, Cotton blasted Bennet and the Times for reversing their initial decision to defend publication of the column in the aftermath of the staff revolt.</p> <p>\u201cThe New York Times editorial page editor and owner defended it in public statements but then they totally surrendered to a woke child mob from their own newsroom that apparently gets triggered if they\u2019re presented with any opinion contrary to their own, as opposed to telling the woke children in their newsroom this is the workplace, not a social justice seminar on campus,\u201d Cotton fumed in an <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/sen-tom-cotton-blasts-ny-times-for-caving-to-woke-child-mob-of-staffers-over-op-ed\">interview on Fox News Sunday</a>.</p> <p>Sewell Chan, a former NY Times editorial page director, was among those who spoke out against his former employers for running the article in the first place.</p> <p>\u201cThe decision to publish [Cotton] calling for troop deployments to quell unrest falls short of sound journalistic practice,\u201d<a href=\"https://twitter.com/sewellchan/status/1268324215536578561\"> he tweeted</a>.</p> <p>Nikole Hannah-Jones, a black New York Times magazine writer, said she was \u201cdeeply ashamed\u201d of the newspaper <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nhannahjones/status/1268334601166106624\">in a tweet</a> that amassed almost 120,000 likes.</p> <p>The New York Times publisher AG Sulzberger acknowledged the turmoil in an internal memo sent to Times staff on Sunday.</p> <p>\u201cWhile this has been a painful week across the company, it has sparked urgent and important conversations,\u201d Sulzberger wrote in the memo, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/07/media/james-bennet-new-york-times-resigns/index.html\">reported by CNN</a>.</p> <p>\u201cLast week we saw a significant breakdown in our editing processes, not the first we\u2019ve experienced in recent years.

Earlier this year&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/dec/28/bret-stephens-new-york-times-jewish-intelligence-eugenics\">readers and staff spoke out</a>&nbsp;against a piece published by the columnist Bret Stephens that critics said embraced eugenics.</p> <p>The protest at the newspaper came as staff at the Philadelphia Inquirer called in sick over the newspaper\u2019s decision to use the headline <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jun/06/philadelphia-inquirer-editor-resigns-buildings-matter-too\">Buildings Matter, Too</a> on an architecture article, a choice considered tone deaf and insensitive to the Black Lives Matter movement.

  "<p>The statement from the college heads of Oxford University is a weak voice wafting over the perfectly trimmed college hedges answering the angry calls of protesters outside (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/04/oxford-college-heads-stand-with-black-students-to-fight-against-systemic-racism\" title=\"\">Letters</a>, 4 June). It is not good enough. Many colleges <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2019/mar/21/oxford-college-to-investigate-its-own-role-in-colonialism\" title=\"\">were built on</a> the systematic abuse of black lives and livelihoods. The statement is passive and allows racism to breathe when black men and women cannot.</p> <p>While recognising the role that education \u201ccan play in building racial equality and fair inclusion of black voices\u201d, the heads fail to acknowledge that education perpetuates inequality and the silencing of black voices. If the Black Lives Matter movement is going to succeed, then we must recognise our past and present failures.</p> <p>They write to \u201creassert our belief in the need to promote, protect and advance equal dignity and respect\u201d, but to reassert statements only acknowledges that previous statements, like this one, have been ineffective. No marks are awarded for repetition in Oxford exams and I am not going to give them any for repeating hopes, wishes and acknowledgements, with no resultant action.</p> <p>This statement comes from the high echelons of academia, yet I can only conclude that the authors are either out of touch or unable to admit their part in the problem. Despite the influence these heads wield, they have offered no suggestions or ideas to create effective and meaningful change. This statement means nothing other than \u201cwe made a statement so we\u2019ve done something, please stop shouting at us\u201d. This is a failure to support the ignored and unheard.</p> <p>It is time to see statements of performative justice not just as ineffective, but offensive. And all this anger from a privileged white girl. Imagine the anger and pain of those who feel the effects of this prejudice constantly.<br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><strong>Ginny Gough</strong><br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><em>Cambridge</em></p> <p>\u2022 Concerning the letter by the heads of Oxford colleges, may we make three points. First, while education, open discussion, etc, are useful tools to tackle racism, they are never enough. As many reports have pointed out, economic inequality also plays a crucial role, and all attempts should be made to reduce its blatant forms. Second, racism does not begin at the age of 18. It starts much earlier and we need to mobilise pre-university institutions as well. Third, we hope the authors are not using the term black just to mean black members of our community but in the modern political sense of non-whites. While recent events in the US continue to reveal the egregious treatment of members of the black community, one should not forget the Chinese, the Indians, the Pakistanis and the Jews, among others, who too have been frequent victims of systemic racism.<br incopy-break-type=\"webbreak\"><strong>Anant Parekh</strong><em> Department of Physiology, University of Oxford,</em><strong> Bhikhu Parekh</strong><em> Labour, House of Lords</em></p> <p>\u2022 In the surreal times we are living through, the simple act of breathing has taken on a disturbing dual symbolism. On the one hand, we have seen the tireless efforts of NHS staff to help Covid-19 patients breathe, while on the other, we witness the horrific events in the United States where police officers have killed a black man by denying him the ability to breathe (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/02/trump-and-biden-offer-starkly-different-visions-with-nation-at-a-crossroads\" title=\"\">Trump and Biden offer starkly different visions with nation at a crossroads</a>, 2 June).</p> <p>Covid-19 has disproportionately affected minority communities in both the UK and the US. The persistence of racial inequality in both countries should be yet another wake-up call to put adequate measures in place to deal with structural racism.

The Trump administration is simply suspending convention, ditching the pretence of pious protocol and ritual that has always been central to the survival of the \u201cnot in America\u201d myth.

American exceptionalism is the proverbial cockroach weathering a nuclear attack \u2013 it survives everything. It survives <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/29/teachers-call-for-ban-on-shooter-drills-in-us-schools\">school shootings</a>, the suspension of due process in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, and the torture and killing of millions of innocent civilians from Vietnam to Iraq. It is&nbsp;at&nbsp;this moment surviving despite the US having the highest coronavirus death toll in the world.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>American exceptionalism is at its most robust when faced with the reality of its structures of racial oppression, the central challenge for which it was designed. In the founding years of the US, a belief in its inherent morality, godliness and superiority to its European origins had to be squared with its savage cruelty toward, and exploitation of, black slaves on an industrial scale.</p> \n<p>The closer the threat of abolition came, the more elaborate the excuses became. In order to defend slavery, John C Calhoun, seventh vice-president of the US, leaned on Aristotle\u2019s theory of natural slavery, the history of Greek democracy and the glory of the Roman empire. The argument was that not only was slavery a positive good, it was a feature of successful civilisations and not bad at all for the slaves themselves who, according to Calhoun, had never \u201cattained a condition so civilised and so improved, not only physically, but morally and intellectually\u201d.</p> \n<p>The reconciling of moral mutual exclusivities continues to reproduce the same&nbsp;denial: racism without racists to pin it on to&nbsp;when black Americans die at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/black-americans-death-rate-covid-19-coronavirus\">disproportionately high rates</a> of Covid-19; police killings without murderers&nbsp;when their perpetrators aren\u2019t charged; and a president who exploited racial animus for support but for whom no racists voted, only the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.economist.com/democracy-in-america/2018/04/26/trump-voters-were-motivated-by-fear-of-losing-their-status\">left behind</a>\u201d.&nbsp;</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/07/britain-is-not-america-but-we-too-are-disfigured-by-deep-and-pervasive-racism\">Britain is not America.

Vulgar and relishing conflict, he seems to be ushering it closer to some endgame. There is something old and something new in this latest racial conflagration. Its global resonance and its national traction is a result not of its uniqueness, but its intensity&nbsp;following an escalation of events. Trump\u2019s rhetoric, the bloodlust of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jun/05/new-york-times-says-tom-cotton-opinion-piece-did-not-meet-editorial-standards\">Republicans spoiling for a fight</a>, police with clear orders&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jan/29/st-louis-police-city-hall-scuffle-unapologetic-pushing-woman\">appetite</a>&nbsp;to stifle protest, and emboldened white supremacists, have heaped provocation on a nation that was already a tinderbox after three years of Trump related polarisation.</p> \n<p>It will inevitably be a wasted opportunity if the recent entrants to the race war, Trump and his emboldened cohort, are seen as&nbsp;too central to the crisis. Too often, the US is cast as a protagonist in a morality play, wrestling with demons that will eventually be defeated&nbsp;if only the right conditions are met. If only the Democrats hadn\u2019t nominated Hillary Clinton, if only Joe Biden can win the election, if only another messianic Barack Obama figure would appear and heal the nation.</p> \n<p>These historic moments will be written rhapsodically in liberal publications, where the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/an-american-tragedy-2\">American tragedy</a>\u201d, as David Remnick called it in his New Yorker essay on the day of Trump\u2019s election, will once again be decried. But they will reach the wrong conclusions, as Remnick did, when he ended on the note that the way forward is \u201cto struggle honorably and fiercely in the name of American ideals\u201d. There are not two competing visions of America battling it out. There has always been one \u2013 under Trump, Obama or whoever is to come next. And its ideals have always been the same: to deny its black population the human rights it extends to its white one, and whenever it is caught doing so graphically, brutally, undeniably on camera, convince itself that this is the exception and not the norm.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Nesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist</p> \n<p>\u2022 On Tuesday 9 June at&nbsp;7pm BST (2pm EDT) the&nbsp;Guardian&nbsp;is&nbsp;holding a&nbsp;live-streamed&nbsp;event&nbsp;about the meaning of George Floyd\u2019s killing,&nbsp;featuring&nbsp;Guardian&nbsp;journalists including&nbsp;US southern bureau chief&nbsp;Oliver Laughland, reporter&nbsp;Kenya Evelyn, writer&nbsp;Chris McGreal and columnist&nbsp;Malaika Jabali.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/event/guardian-newsroom-the-killing-of-george-floyd-107707269342\">Book tickets here</a></p>",
  "<p>As protests over the police killing of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a> continue across the US, a slew of influential rightwing figures have been urging an ever more violent crackdown on the demonstrations \u2013 and it appears <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> is listening.</p> <p>Republican politicians, media personalities and rightwing activists have floated ideas including deploying specific units of the military, while one Republican candidate for Congress has even suggested she will shoot protesters.</p> <p>With a president who has previously formulated policy based on what is being mooted on conservative <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/fox-news\">Fox News</a> or among the rightwing Twitter-sphere, the consequences of this lobbying for violence could be severe.</p> <p>Tom Cotton, a US senator for Arkansas who is said to be <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/its-never-too-early-tom-cotton-headed-to-new-hampshire-to-put-a-toe-in-2024-waters\">plotting a run for president</a> in 2024, has been one of the loudest voices.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cIf local law enforcement is overwhelmed and needs backup, let\u2019s see how tough these antifa terrorists are when they\u2019re facing off with the 101st Airborne Division,\u201d Cotton <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TomCottonAR/status/1267448171636174848?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1267522468400562183&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rightwingwatch.org%2Fpost%2Fafter-days-of-unrest-%25E2%2580%258Bthe-right-lusts-for-george-floyd-protesters-blood%2F\">tweeted on Monday</a>, pulling off the neat trick of both labelling <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/01/far-right-conspiracy-theory-us-civil-war\">anti-fascist activists</a> \u201cterrorists\u201d and plugging his own service in the US army.</p> <p>In a follow-up tweet, Cotton added: \u201cAnd, if necessary, the 10th Mountain, 82nd Airborne, 1st Cav, 3rd Infantry\u2014whatever it takes to restore order. No quarter for insurrectionists, anarchists, rioters, and looters.\u201d</p> <p>The phrase \u201cno quarter\u201d has historically meant to kill opponents, rather than arrest them, as MediaMatter\u2019s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/LisPower1/status/1267484636378288133\">Lis Power swiftly pointed out</a>, but Cotton\u2019s demand for the US military to take to the streets of cities and towns across the country was cheered by the president.</p> <p>\u201c100% Correct. Thank you Tom!\u201d Trump tweeted, as he reposted Cotton\u2019s idea.</p> <p>In commentary on the demonstrations against police brutality, Cotton has repeatedly painted the situation in the US as a dystopian nightmare. He has suggested, wrongly, that there are \u201cmass gatherings of rioters destroying our cities\u201d, whereas the majority of the protests in the US have been non-violent.&nbsp;</p> <p>In a column, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/opinion/tom-cotton-protests-military.html\">published by the New York Times</a> amid <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jun/03/new-york-times-op-ed-tom-cotton-backlash-staff\">controversy</a> and under the headline \u201cSend in the troops\u201d, Cotton suggested \u201crioters have plunged many American cities into anarchy\u201d. This will probably come as a surprise to people living in American cities, but this framing allowed Cotton to carry on his demand for a potentially violent crackdown on the protests.</p> <p>\u201cOne thing above all else will restore order to our streets: an overwhelming show of force,\u201d Cotton said in the NYT article, suggesting only this could end what he called an \u201corgy of violence\u201d.</p> <p>The agitating hasn\u2019t been restricted to Cotton.&nbsp;</p> <p>On Sunday Noah Pollak, a writer for the conservative Washington Free Beacon, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NoahPollak/status/1267176707640840192\">posted a photograph on Twitter</a> of inmates being held in stress positions at Guant\u00e1namo Bay \u2013 the US naval prison where many Muslim men have been tortured since it opened in 2002 \u2013 along with the suggestion:</p> <p>\u201cWe did it with al-Qaida terrorists, now it\u2019s time to do it with antifa. Imagine the joyous feeling if you knew the people wearing orange jumpsuits in this picture had face piercings, purple hair, and were from Portland, Oregon. Camp X-Ray, GITMO.\u201d</p> <p>As the protests spread to cities across the country, the tough talk, largely from people paid to sit at desks, came thick and fast.</p> <p>\u201cNow that we clearly see antifa as terrorists, can we hunt them down like we do those in the Middle East?,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mattgaetz/status/1267601406766264323/photo/1\">tweeted Matt Gaetz</a>, a Florida congressman who has built a political career through his fealty to Trump.

Just a few months ago, he was painting the Democrats as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/01/trump-conservatives-socialism-bernie-sanders-politics\">radical socialists</a> in thrall to Senator Bernie Sanders, but the party\u2019s nomination was secured by the moderate Joe Biden. He was also trumpeting the strength of the economy, but that narrative was shredded by the coronavirus pandemic \u2013 although there was some encouraging news at the end of last week to suggest that US jobs were returning after the lockdown was lifted in many states.</p> <p>Trump pivoted to blaming China for the virus but polls suggested this gained little traction as voters scrutinised the president\u2019s own sluggish response. But then came the tragedy of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd,</a> an African American man killed when a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his neck with his knee. The subsequent social unrest, the most widespread in half a century, may now have thrown Trump a political lifeline.</p> <p>The great majority of the protests, including that outside the White House on Monday, have been peaceful, highlighting the injustices of 400 years of slavery and segregation. Some have been met with vicious state-sanctioned force. However, incidents of violence, including ransacking stores and burning police cars, received outsized TV coverage and handed Trump a cultural wedge issue to exploit.</p> <p>Mandy Jenkins, a journalist, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mjenkins/status/1268558449098526721?s=20\">tweeted on Thursday:</a> \u201cMy friends and family in rural Ohio honestly believe large swaths of America\u2019s cities are being destroyed by lawless bands of looters who are the same people that are protesting. They get their news exclusively from TV. I don\u2019t think those things are unrelated.\u201d</p> <p>Like an autocrat in a teetering regime, Trump has staged a massive show of force in the humid capital, with Gen Mark Milley, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/defense/500626-joint-chiefs-chair-walks-dc-streets-amid-protests-we-protect-freedom-of-speech\">strutting the streets</a> in combat fatigues while military helicopters roared overhead.

This week James Mattis, the former defense secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/03/james-mattis-comdemns-trump-george-floyd-protests\">broke a long silence</a> to describe Trump as a threat to the constitution and the first president in his lifetime who does not try to unite the American people.</p> <p>But there are doubts over whether such a pitch can work in a country facing its biggest public health crisis since 1918, biggest economic crisis since 1933 and biggest race relations crisis since 1968.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MichaelSteele?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Michael Steele,</a> former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said: \u201cIt\u2019s not the smartest strategy in the world, given not just the complexity but the volatility of the nation\u2019s grappling with race and the death of this young man and the response by the police and now the response by the administration.</p> <p>\u201cSo I think that cooler heads will ultimately try to prevail. I doubt they will be successful, at least completely, with Trump because he sees the law-and-order angle as his gate key to open up a new line of conversation. For example, we\u2019re not talking about Covid-19 and the failure of the administration to grapple with the enormity of that crisis.\u201d</p> <p>Some around Trump compare the moment to 1968, when <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2020/06/04/1968-2020-riots-pandemic-law-and-order/\">Nixon ran as the law-and-order candidate</a> after a summer of riots and won the White House.

If you are a liberal and you\u2019re worried about this working against Biden, then 71 and 72 are the years that give you nightmares.\u201d</p> <p>Nixon and Trump came from very different starting points, however. Jamelle Bouie, an opinion columnist at the New York Times, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/02/opinion/floyd-trump-nixon-coronavirus.html\">wrote this week:</a><strong> \u201c</strong>As former vice-president to Dwight Eisenhower \u2013 who led the nation at a time when the white American majority felt culturally and economically secure \u2013 Nixon could credibly claim to represent stability in the face of chaos, a steady hand in an uncertain time.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/john-kelly-trump-character-ethics-mattis\">John Kelly says Americans should \u2018look harder at who we elect\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cTrump can do no such thing. He built his entire political persona around discord and disruption. Having promised t<em>o</em>&nbsp;throw the system into disarray, Trump could not then sell himself as an avatar of order and control. He can sell himself as an avatar of violence \u2026 but there\u2019s no evidence that most Americans want that kind of \u2018leadership\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Recent polls show <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/us/politics/trump-campaign-virus-protests-polls.html\">Biden leading Trump</a> nationally and in swing states, and eating into his advantages among older voters. The president\u2019s law-and-order stance would seem calculated to win them back while setting a political trap for Biden, who must strike a delicate balance between validating anger over police brutality towards African American while condemning violence as a response.</p> <p><a href=\"https://johnzogbystrategies.com/about-us/\">John Zogby,</a> a pollster and author, said: \u201cTrump has seen some serious slippage among white voters over 65. That was a bedrock of his base, so this could be a way: these are people that are far removed from the violence in the streets and fairly one-dimensional in their view of both protesting and violence in the streets, and the most conservative on matters of race.</p> <p>\u201cNow, will it work? It\u2019s risky and it\u2019s hard to see it working but then he has defied so many rules of engagement. It\u2019s really incumbent now on Joe Biden and the Democrats to win.\u201d</p>",
  "<p><br>The menacing sight of heavily armoured US military vehicles and personnel seizing control of the streets is a familiar one for residents of Baghdad and Kabul. Last week, citizens of Washington and other American cities experienced similar treatment \u2013 at the hands of their own government.</p> <p>Donald Trump\u2019s alarming over-reaction to the mostly lawful protests that followed George Floyd\u2019s death produced a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/04/aclu-lawsuit-trump-protesters-church-white-house\">powerful backlash</a> among political and military leaders. It also highlighted increased US reliance, at home and abroad, on the aggressive use of force as a first resort.<br></p> <p>The militarisation of US police forces, and American society as a whole, is rooted in the response to the 9/11 attacks, when George W Bush plunged the country into a state of perpetual war. Paradoxically, his \u201cglobal war on terror\u201d intensified international and domestic insecurity.</p> <p>It sparked a huge, parallel expansion in the powers and reach of the homeland security apparatus. As <a href=\"https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2019/12/19/pentagon-finally-gets-its-2020-budget-from-congress/\">Pentagon spending</a> grew to a whopping $738bn this year, total <a href=\"https://www.urban.org/policy-centers/cross-center-initiatives/state-and-local-finance-initiative/state-and-local-backgrounders/police-and-corrections-expenditures\">police and prison budgets</a> have also soared, reaching $194bn in 2017. About 18,000 law enforcement agencies employ 800,000 officers nationwide. Many are armed to the teeth.<br></p> <p>Deserving or not, members of the US armed forces are routinely described as heroes by Trump and others. Amid high levels of gun violence, many on the frontline of domestic law enforcement plainly feel they are worthy of similar status and protection.</p> <p>Yet when police officers are uniformed, equipped and armed like soldiers, it is unsurprising that they act with soldier-like impunity, treating civilians as the enemy in what Mark Esper, the defence secretary, calls the <a href=\"https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2020/06/01/secdef-encourages-governors-to-dominate-the-battlespace-to-put-down-nationwide-protests/\">urban \u201cbattlespace\u201d</a>. In the past week, there were multiple incidents of police combat and resulting gratuitous violence.<br></p> <p>Trump\u2019s panicky actions further blurred the line between military and civil power, by linking patriotism and militarism. He is not the first president to wrap himself in the flag. But this Vietnam draft-dodger who is commander-in-chief exhibits scant understanding of what fidelity to country and constitution means.</p> <p>Trump boasts about US military power and his bigger, better nuclear weapons. He sought personal legitimacy by hiring savvy generals such as HR McMaster and James Mattis, then rejected their advice. He recklessly threatens states such as North Korea with \u201cfire and fury\u201d. He mounts <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-48877172\">military parades</a> to glorify himself.<br></p> <p>But the problem is not simply Trump or the police. Since declaring cold war victory in 1991, an unfettered America has increasingly relied on the continuous projection of military force overseas, downgrading diplomacy, mediation and \u201csoft power\u201d approaches.</p> <p>This militarist mindset, ever focused on warfare, conflict and supremacy (or \u201cdomination\u201d, to quote Trump), has had an inevitably&nbsp;corrosive impact at home. The bill fell due last week.<br></p> <p>James Madison, one of the founding fathers, warned of the danger over 200 years ago. \u201cOf all the enemies to public liberty, war is perhaps the most to be dreaded \u2026 In war, the discretionary power of the executive is extended \u2026 No nation could preserve its freedom in the midst of continual warfare,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/359542-of-all-the-enemies-to-public-liberty-war-is-perhaps\">Madison wrote</a>.<br></p> <p>The belief that unchecked militarism is inimical to liberty has been usefully explored in recent years by Andrew Bacevich, a Boston university historian and former army colonel and Vietnam veteran.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>More dangerous is the damage to American leadership and the global cause of democratic governance</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cToday as never before in their history, Americans are enthralled with military power,\u201d he wrote in his 2005 bestseller, <em><a href=\"https://www.independent.org/publications/tir/article.asp?id=569\">The New American Militarism</a></em>, which excoriated Bush\u2019s \u201cimmoral, illicit and imprudent\u201d Iraq invasion. The quest for supremacy always ended in degeneracy.<br></p> <p>\u201cAmerica will surely share the fate of all those who in ages past have looked to war and military power to fulfil their destiny. We will rob future generations of their rightful inheritance. We will wreak havoc abroad. We will endanger our security at home. We will risk the forfeiture of all that we prize,\u201d Bacevich warned.</p> <p>Neo-conservatives hated his message. But with present-day <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/03/james-mattis-comdemns-trump-george-floyd-protests\">generals up in arms</a> about Trump\u2019s abuse of military power, and the nation enraged at the actions of paramilitary police, maybe the right is listening now.<br></p> <p>Patriotism and pride in one\u2019s country are not the issue here. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with saluting the flag and supporting the troops \u2013 or the police, if they do their job right.</p> <p>But when it becomes a fetish, when it\u2019s obligatory, when such natural instincts are hijacked by demagogues such as Trump, when militarism, ultra-nationalism and hateful jingoism, fuelling entrenched racism and xenophobia, take hold \u2013 that\u2019s when catastrophe looms.</p> <p>It renders the US a threat to itself and others, and weakens its global influence. Perhaps the police and social reforms urged by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/03/obama-george-floyd-remarks-protests-trump\">Barack Obama</a> will gain traction as anger over Floyd subsides. Internationally, the harm done to US standing looks serious.<br></p> <p>Scornful <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/mr-president-dont-go-hide-china-goads-us-over-george-floyd-protests\">Chinese and Russian claims of hypocrisy</a>, and the appalled reaction of allies in Europe, Canada and Australia, are galling but manageable. More dangerous is the damage to American leadership and the global cause of democratic governance.<br></p> <p>Trump\u2019s repressive action \u201cgives a tool to dictators, autocrats and thugs\u201d, Jake Sullivan, senior adviser to Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, told a <em>Foreign Policy</em> magazine webinar. \u201cIt leads them to believe they are righteous, that they don\u2019t have to listen to complaints about human rights, equality and democracy.\u201d</p> <p>Ironically, it also undermined US national security, Sullivan said. \u201cThe US cannot be a secure country if it is not capable of being a just and equal country.\u201d</p> <p>That warning was echoed by Richard Haass of the US Council on Foreign Relations. \u201cThe US is and appears to the world divided, diminished and distracted,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cHard to believe we will not be challenged somewhere, somehow by someone wanting to take advantage of these circumstances. These are truly dangerous times.\u201d</p> <p>In other words, as a militarised America turns its fire on itself, outside enemies take aim.<br></p>",
  "<p>Britain is \u201cabsenting itself from the world stage\u201d by refusing to show leadership over Hong Kong residents, confront China or condemn President Trump over his handling of the fallout from George Floyd\u2019s killing, the shadow foreign secretary has warned.</p> <p>In her most stinging attack on Britain\u2019s foreign policy, Lisa Nandy said that the government was now displaying \u201ca pattern of behaviour that is becoming very, very troubling\u201d, and that the UK\u2019s actions were being noted by leaders around the world.</p> <p>In an interview with the <em>Observer</em>, Nandy suggested that the offer made by Boris Johnson to hand \u201ca route to citizenship\u201d to around three million Hong Kong residents eligible for a British National (Overseas) passport was too vague to be taken seriously by Beijing.

The prime minister has been remarkably silent about that as well.</p> <p>\u201cIt seems to me that we lose all moral authority to talk about police brutality in Hong Kong and elsewhere if we are not prepared to apply those standards equally to other parts of the world. This is a pattern of behaviour that\u2019s becoming very, very troubling \u2013 that the UK is absenting itself from the world stage at precisely the moment when we need to show global leadership.\u201d</p> <p>Nandy praised the work of former Tory foreign secretary William Hague, but warned that British foreign policy had been \u201centirely framed through the lens of growth and trade\u201d since his departure in 2014.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThat has led us into a position where we have been courting the Chinese government, praising the golden era of Sino-British relations, without paying due attention to the need to have strategic independence and to be able to speak from a position of our values.

The offer was made as he urged China to rethink its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/china-vote-npc-national-security-laws-hong-kong-us-protest\">controversial security law</a>, which pro-democracy campaigners say threatens rights in Hong Kong.</p> <p>However, Nandy did not commit Labour to backing a scheme that would allow eligible Hong Kong residents to settle in the UK. \u201cThere\u2019s a moral case for ensuring that people who want to leave Hong Kong can and that they\u2019re provided with a safe haven elsewhere. But there is also a moral case to make sure that any sanctions that we pursue, while they have an impact on China, don\u2019t unduly harm the people of Hong Kong.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>She warned that the government\u2019s approach to the threat to Hong Kong was part of its wider reluctance to confront Beijing: \u201cWe need a strategy at home and we need a strategy abroad in relation to the rise of China \u2026 and at the moment, we\u2019ve got neither.\u201d</p> <p>She also criticised the decision to involve Huawei in the UK\u2019s 5G network, saying that a failure to develop domestic technology meant Britain was not in a \u201cposition of greatest strategic independence\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe government is likely to bring forward a bill before the summer recess to chart a path forwards that will reduce dependence on Huawei in the 5G network. We would support that \u2013 we\u2019ll obviously have to see the detail.</p> <p>\u201cAfter Huawei, there will be other issues.

  "<p>The political obituaries of Donald Trump were all prepared. At the end of a week that has seen American cities convulsed by protests over the killing of <a href=\"heguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/jun/05/george-floyd-protests-donald-trump-hydroxychloroquine-live\" title=\"\">George Floyd</a>, the president would be faced with an increase in unemployment worse than anything seen in the Great Depression.</p> <p>Well, it didn\u2019t turn out like that. The US economy actually <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/05/us-unemployment-may-great-depression-job-loss\" title=\"\">created 2.5 million jobs in May</a> and the unemployment rate went down rather than up. The consensus among analysts was that it would shed 7.5 million jobs, a colossally wrong call. And a deeply significant one.</p> <p>Instead of Trump being the new Herbert Hoover \u2013 the one-term occupant of the White House from 1929-33 \u2013 the amazingly good jobs figures hold out the prospect of him stealing Bill Clinton\u2019s nickname and being the next comeback kid.</p> <p>The US has a reputation for bouncing back from adversity quickly, but even by its own standards the turnaround has been remarkable. If the data from the Bureau for Labour Statistics (BLS) are to be believed, large numbers of workers who lost their jobs when the economy went lockdown in March were rehired as restrictions were eased from mid-May onwards. On Thursday, the day before the official payroll data was released, there had been figures out showing almost 2 million Americans had filed jobless claims the previous week, taking the total to more than 40 million since the crisis began.</p> <p>Trump seemed as surprised as anyone by the news, but for once his hyperbole was fully justified. The president tweeted that the numbers were incredible, stunning and stupendous \u2013 as indeed they were. He also praised himself for the sudden reversal of fortune, which was less justified. If any one man can claim credit, it is the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, who acted early and acted big to provide record amounts of stimulus.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There\u2019s no getting away from the fact that this was good news for Trump at a time when he appeared to be overwhelmed by a triple-whammy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Stock markets soared on the news. For days, equity prices have been rising amid optimism about a V-shaped recession, even though there has been little hard evidence to support this view. Now there is. The BLS said there had been sharp increases in hiring in those sectors especially hard hit by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\" title=\"\">Covid-19</a> lockdown: hospitality, leisure, retail, construction and education. Average earnings also fell, a sign that the lower-paid employees that bore the brunt of the pandemic-induced layoffs have started to find work again.</p> <p>All that said, the labour market is still a long way from being in the sort of rude health that an incumbent president would wish it to be five months before an election. The number of job losses for March was revised up, meaning that employment in the US has fallen by 20 million since peaking earlier this year. The unemployment rate has almost quadrupled from 3.5% to 13.3% and social distancing is likely to mean that the pace of hiring will be slower than it would be otherwise. There could be a second wave of the virus when temperatures start to drop in the autumn.</p> <p>But there\u2019s no getting away from the fact that this was good news for Trump at a time when he appeared to be overwhelmed by a triple-whammy of coronavirus, street protests and rising unemployment. He will now be hopeful of further falls in unemployment as lockdown restrictions are eased in the densely populated north-eastern states, and that the better jobs news will continue to keep the stock market running hot.</p> <p>None of which is to say that Trump will get a second term come November. But if he does, the May jobs report will have proved to have been a decisive moment.</p> <h2>Facebook\u2019s stance on presidential tweets risks a staff exodus</h2> <p>Compare the responses of two social media giants to President Trump\u2019s threat to Americans protesting about the death of George Floyd at the hands of police. \u201cWhen the looting starts, the shooting starts,\u201d Trump tweeted, later claiming that he had been ignorant of the rhyme\u2019s racist origins.</p> <p>Both Facebook and Twitter hosted the message, but the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/29/twitter-hides-donald-trump-tweet-glorifying-violence\" title=\"\">latter quickly distanced itself from the president\u2019s words</a>, hiding the post on the grounds that it glorified violence. In a bold move, a private company censored the White House.</p> <p>Facebook, on the other hand, took a long hard look at what Trump had said and shrugged its shoulders. Its founder and boss, Mark Zuckerberg, said Facebook was aware of the racist resonance of the president\u2019s comment but had a policy of allowing states to warn the public about the potential use of force.</p> <p>Reports of Facebook\u2019s demise are usually premature, but this could yet prove a defining moment.</p> <p>It isn\u2019t so much that Facebook risks sparking an exodus of socially conscious young people. After all, it is already the social network of their parents\u2019 generation rather than their own. Its users are, typically, a cohort who have little appetite for migrating to new platforms but who wield the kind of spending power that keeps advertising dollars rolling in.</p> <p>The Silicon Valley starlets who keep Facebook at the cutting edge of progress might prove more of a problem. Its staff are famed for their almost cultish devotion to Zuckerberg\u2019s empire but their dear leader\u2019s stance has sparked insurrection. Hundreds staged a walkout while several came forward to condemn Zuckerberg\u2019s stance. Some have even quit in disgust.</p> <p>Facebook has no shortage of brilliant engineers queuing up to work at the company. But in the fast-evolving world of Silicon Valley, it needs to attract and retain the very best. Many of them may now be looking elsewhere.</p> <h2>This crisis must not become a reason to postpone climate action</h2> <p>For those hoping the coronavirus crisis might be the moment to steer Britain towards a greener, cleaner future, the publication of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/04/chemicals-firm-basf-biggest-beneficiary-of-uk-coronavirus-loan-scheme\" title=\"\">list of companies who have benefited from the Bank of England\u2019s cheap Covid-19 loans</a> will have made depressing reading. Airlines and car manufacturers are among the major beneficiaries.</p> <p>That list was disclosed amid revelations that the government has been pondering car industry demands for a \u201cmarket stimulus\u201d, or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/03/uk-car-industry-pushes-for-scrappage-scheme-to-help-buy-new-petrol-and-diesel-vehicles\" title=\"\">scrappage scheme</a>, that would not discriminate between diesel and electric vehicles.</p> <p>With the chill winds of an economic reckoning ahead, once the lockdown spring and summer is over, it could be tempting to simply boost demand and preserve any and all jobs. Right now, simply to restore a functioning economy and society might appear a sufficiently worthwhile and ambitious target for government. But the hard truth is that when the pandemic is over, the climate emergency will loom ever closer and larger \u2013 as even Boris Johnson acknowledged on Friday\u2019s World Environment Day.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1268843310162022402\" title=\"\">prime minister\u2019s tweets</a> had the scent of a Green New Deal, talking of a recovery that would help shape more resilient, relevant industries for the future. The world economy has now seen how its foundations can be rocked by a natural disaster \u2013 and, sooner or later, there will be another one. But few will now have faith that the government\u2019s actions will match its environmental rhetoric.</p> <p>So far, the only condition imposed on emergency funding appears to be demanding fare rises on Transport for London\u2019s public services. It would be perverse indeed now to refrain from the tough love of attaching environmental conditions to private firms. Any scrappage scheme that simply allowed the UK taxpayer to subsidise the purchase of more fossil-fuel cars, and did not attempt to significantly alter emissions and infrastructure, would be an appalling missed opportunity.</p>",
  "<p>America has been here before, split by racial division that left its cities in flames and its citizens demanding a different country.</p> \n<p>But not for half a century, and never with a president whose responses to demands for basic justice were so belligerent and divisive that even his former top military officials have turned on him.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/06/breonna-taylor-louisville-protest-george-floyd\">'She should be with us': Louisville protesters remember Breonna Taylor</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>By the end of the week, Donald Trump, who promised to build a \u201cbig, beautiful wall\u201d to protect America, had thrown up a large steel fence around the White House as the sense of a presidency under siege grew.</p> \n<p>The fires lit in Minneapolis by a police officer squeezing the life out of George Floyd, by kneeling on his neck for nearly nine minutes, ignited the biggest protests since the anti-Vietnam war and civil rights movement of the 1960s.</p> \n<p>Most of the demonstrations were peaceful, and where they weren\u2019t that was frequently down to the police. But rioters left a five-mile long scar through southern Minneapolis as they burned and looted their way along one of the area\u2019s main shopping thoroughfares after ransacking the police station at the centre of the storm over Floyd\u2019s death.</p> \n<p>From there, a surge of anger radiated across the country, driven in good part by the nature of the nine-minute video of Floyd\u2019s killing, but also the frustration that for all the promises made with each police killing of an unarmed black man they do not stop.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0617b81f-5431-457d-b963-3e057fc1b578\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gfIWyPgE_E0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>When the traumatic video of Floyd begging for his life met the tinder of weeks of coronavirus lockdown, surging unemployment and a tanking economy the fire raced through America. It ignited protests and riots from New York to Los Angeles and the south, and then London, Berlin and beyond.</p> \n<p>Now, as 50 years ago, the national guard were called out to face down the demonstrators, although this time it was also to stand guard over the violent dispersal of a legal and peaceful protest to provide a photo op for Trump. Now, as then, the president accused \u201coutside agitators\u201d \u2013 Trump called them terrorists \u2013 of stirring up trouble.</p> \n<p>But this time, voices from the American establishment spoke up in support of those demands, and warned that the US is at an inflection point.</p> \n<p>So, apparently, was Trump\u2019s presidency, as he flailed while his tested tactic of divide-and-rule proved less effective. The power of the nearly nine minutes of Floyd\u2019s suffering as the police officer charged with his murder, Derek Chauvin, looked into the camera was taken as a statement of police contempt for African American lives and the Black Lives Matter movement.</p> \n<p>It was the moment when many of the doubters in America, the people always prepared to give the police the benefit of the doubt, were confronted with the indisputable evidence that police treat black people differently. If further evidence was required it came in the swirl of recordings of officers beating peaceful unarmed demonstrators that in some cities, including New York, drew accusations of a police riot.</p> \n<p>By the end of the week, the entire culture and practice of policing in America was on trial and not just over Floyd. But it was more than just policing.</p> \n<p>Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota, where the protests began, described the uprising as a singular opportunity in his state\u2019s history to break the chain of \u201csystemic racism and the lack of accountability up and down our society that led to a daytime murder of a black man on a street in Minneapolis\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think this is probably our last shot as a state and a nation to fix this systemic issue,\u201d he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b7eb9a5cff8de613c39db210ac178f039ef819bf\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b7eb9a5cff8de613c39db210ac178f039ef819bf/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman in Washington on Friday holds a placard demanding justice for George Floyd.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman in Washington on Friday holds a placard demanding justice for George Floyd.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eric Thayer/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The Rev Al Sharpton, a central figure in America\u2019s civil rights movement, put it more succinctly in a rallying cry at the Minneapolis memorial service for Floyd on Thursday. White America, he said, needed \u201cto get off our neck\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe reason we could never be who we wanted and dreamed of being is you kept your knee on our neck,\u201d he cried to shouts of agreement. \u201cWe could do whatever anyone else could do. But we couldn\u2019t get your knee off our neck. What happened to Floyd happens every day in this country in education and health services and in every area of American life.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s time for us to stand up in George\u2019s name and say: get your knee off our necks.\u201d</p> \n<p>There were signs that the rest of America is ever more willing to hear that message than ever.</p> \n<p>Almost no one was willing to try to defend Chauvin\u2019s abuse of Floyd.</p> \n<p>Whereas construction workers turned on the anti-war protesters who marched through New York after the national guard shot demonstrators at Kent State University in 1970, this week \u201chard hats\u201d working in the city were seen clapping the demonstrators demanding justice.</p> \n<p>As the police teargassed and shot at people protesting legally from Portland to Kansas City, those on the receiving end included Americans not usually found marching to demand police accountability. Even some Republicans normally quick to defend the police were alarmed enough by the video of Floyd\u2019s death to turn out to march.</p> \n<p>In many places, the violent police response to legitimate protest only strengthened the sense that the problem lies deep in the culture of militarised police departments that act like occupation forces in minority communities.</p> \n<p>Yet there were also glimpses of progress. Police officers in other parts of the country \u2013 in Texas, Kentucky, Florida and other Trump states \u2013 went down on bended knee in a show of solidarity with the demands of demonstrators. Among them was the police chief of Ferguson, Missouri \u2013 the birthplace of the Black Lives Matters movement six years ago following riots and protests over the police killing of Michael Brown.</p> \n<p>The president instinctively lashed out over a crisis he couldn\u2019t control, with his tested attempts to create division and mayhem. But it proved to be the week when lines began to be drawn on the limits of Trump\u2019s power to subvert.</p> \n<p>The president has already neutralised the US justice department, freeing his allies from prison and compromising investigations. The supreme court is weighted in favour of his agenda, thanks to the highly politicised nomination process placing ideology over competenceunder a Republican-run Senate afraid of Trump.</p> \n<p>That left the military as the remaining branch of government over which his malign influence was not yet decisive.</p> \n<p>Then came what was quickly tagged the Battle of Lafayette Square, a small patch of park in front of the White House.</p> \n<p>A large and noisy group of protesters had gathered there to make known their support for demands that all of the police officers involved in Floyd\u2019s death be arrested. Ever sensitive to criticism, Trump was feeling humiliated by a report that he\u2019d bolted for a bunker under the White House a few days previously when demonstrators tried to climb its fence.</p> \n<p>Driven by his inner Putin, Trump decided to prove his courage by wading manfully into Lafayette Square to have his photo taken holding a Bible in front of a church. That would have the added benefit of playing to the evangelical vote.</p> \n<p>But first the peaceful protesters had to be cleared. Trump\u2019s attorney general, William Barr, ordered the police to empty the square, which they did with teargas and baton charges backed by soldiers of the national guard.</p> \n<p>Not long after, the sight of the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, Gen Mark Milley, in combat fatigues marching behind the president as he strode across Lafayette Square seemed to give a stamp of approval to Trump\u2019s threat to turn out the military against those he was labelling domestic terrorists.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/06/nfl-decision-to-permit-kneeling-protest-by-players-enrages-donald-trump\">NFL decision to permit kneeling protest by players enrages Donald Trump</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The defence secretary, Mark Esper, had told state governors to \u201cdominate the battle space\u201d by which he meant up the use of force in their cities. The president\u2019s allies in Congress upped the ante, with Senator Tom Cotton proposing to send in the 82nd Airborne or \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d against those he called \u201cinsurrectionists\u201d. Trump, as ever on Twitter, gave that idea the thumbs up.</p> \n<p>Faced with this, America\u2019s military establishment chose a side.</p> \n<p>The first to break cover was James Mattis, the marine general who resigned as Trump\u2019s defence secretary in December 2018 and kept silent until now. He described himself \u201cangry and appalled\u201d at Trump\u2019s response to the protests and called him as a threat to the constitution.</p> \n<p>\u201cDonald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people \u2013 does not even pretend to try.

He accused Trump of disdain for the right of peaceful protest and said he was \u201cdeeply worried\u201d that the military will be co-opted for political purposes.</p> \n<p>\u201cI have to date been reticent to speak out on issues surrounding President Trump\u2019s leadership, but we are at an inflection point, and the events of the past few weeks have made it impossible to remain silent,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>The head of the national guard, Gen Joseph Lengyel, felt it necessary to stake out a position just in case anyone thought he was siding with the president on the value of black lives. He said he was \u201csickened\u201d by Floyd\u2019s killing and \u201cenraged\u201d at the deaths of unarmed black men at the hands of \u201cpolice brutality and extrajudicial violence\u201d.</p> \n<p>Esper retreated. On Wednesday, he disavowed the idea of sending the military in to control the streets of America\u2019s cities. Not long after, the Pentagon began pulling out 1,600 troops moved to the Washington DC area during the protests. Few expect Esper to survive in his job for very much longer.</p> \n<p>But the real damage was inflicted on Trump. His chaotic handling of Covid-19, with deaths close to 110,000 and rising, had already damaged his diminishing prospects for re-election.</p> \n<p>The pandemic has also badly hit the one issue on which many Trump voters were prepared to forgive him all else: the economy. More than 20m jobs were lost in April. May saw 2.5m of those return, although unemployment for African Americans kept rising.</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s response to the employment numbers on Friday was to describe it as a \u201cgreat day\u201d for Floyd.</p> \n<p>\u201cHopefully, George is looking down right now and saying, \u2018This is a great thing happening for our country. A great day for him, a great day for everybody,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>For his critics, the comment was another piece of the president\u2019s casual callousness mixed with self-obsession. But for all his boasts, Trump can no longer make claims for a booming economy, even if stock market growth did not translate into better standards of living for most Americans.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf 110,000 people have died and there\u2019s been no response, if we can move the national guard in a matter of hours but we can\u2019t keep people safe from a pandemic, it goes to show what the priorities are,\u201d said Annie Isler, a middle school teacher outside the Floyd\u2019s memorial in Minneapolis.</p> \n<p>Opinion polls put Joe Biden, now officially the Democratic nominee, ahead by 10 points or more.</p> \n<p>Confronted with this on Fox News, Trump said that four years ago the polls said Hillary Clinton was going to win and they were wrong. In any case, he has his own numbers.</p> \n<p>\u201cI have other polls where I\u2019m winning, and you\u2019ve seen them, too, I guess,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>No one else appeared to know where these polls were.</p> \n<p>As Minneapolis picked up the pieces, Al Sharpton led the memorial service for George Floyd. Alongside his demand for white America to \u201cget off our necks\u201d, and the heart rending glimpses into Floyd\u2019s life from his family, perhaps the most tortuous part for the mourners was when Sharpton asked them to stand in silence for eight minutes and 46 seconds to understand just how long Chauvin kept his knee pressing down on the African American man\u2019s neck.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"da96bd09b3befd5006cca61fc0b4895deeb7d5e1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da96bd09b3befd5006cca61fc0b4895deeb7d5e1/0_0_3500_2323/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Black Lives Matter mural in Washington.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Black Lives Matter mural in Washington.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlos Barr\u00eda/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cAs you go through these long eight minutes, think about what George was going through, laying there for those eight minutes, begging for his own life.

Activists who have long fought to cut law enforcement budgets say they are seeing an unprecedented wave of support for their ideas, with some elected officials for the first time proposing budget reductions and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/minneapolis-public-school-end-police-contract\">divestments from police</a>. Here\u2019s what we know about the movement, and how cities and states are responding. </p> \n  <h2><strong>What does it mean to </strong><strong>\u2018defund the police\u2019</strong><strong>? </strong></h2> \n  <p>For years, community groups have advocated for defunding law enforcement \u2013 taking money away from police and prisons \u2013 and reinvesting those funds in services. The basic principle is that government budgets and \u201cpublic safety\u201d spending should prioritize housing, employment, community health, education and other vital programs, instead of police officers. Advocates argue that defunding is the best way forward since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/31/the-answer-to-police-violence-is-not-reform-its-defunding-heres-why\">attempts to reform police practices</a> over the last five years have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/us-police-officers-fired-rehired-why\">failed</a>, as evidenced by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/04/american-police-violence-against-black-people\">brutal killing of George Floyd</a>. Groups have a range of demands, with some seeking modest reductions and others viewing full defunding as a step toward abolishing contemporary police services. </p> \n  <h2><strong>How much does America currently spend on police? </strong></h2> \n  <p>In the past four decades, the cost of policing in the US has tripled and is now $115bn, according to a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-04/america-s-policing-budget-has-nearly-tripled-to-115-billion\">recent analysis</a>. That steady increase comes as crime has been consistently declining. In most cities, spending on police is <a href=\"https://populardemocracy.org/sites/default/files/Freedom%20To%20Thrive%2C%20Higher%20Res%20Version.pdf\">significantly greater</a> than spending on services and other departments ($1.8bn on police in Los Angeles, for example, which is <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-06-04/lapd-budget-cuts-garcetti-protests-explainer\">more than half</a> the city\u2019s general fund). The Covid-19 economic crisis has led cities and states to make drastic budget <a href=\"https://www.changethenypd.org/nycbudgetjustice\">cuts</a> to education, youth programs, arts and culture, parks, libraries, housing services and more.

It has never been. We can no longer use the flag to turn people away or distract them from the real issues that face our black communities. We did this back in 2017, and regretfully I brought it back with my comments this week. We must stop talking about the flag and shift our attention to the real issues of systemic racial injustice, economic oppression, police brutality, and judicial &amp; prison reform. We are at a critical juncture in our nation\u2019s history! If not now, then when? We as a white community need to listen and learn from the pain and suffering of our black communities. We must acknowledge the problems, identify the solutions, and then put this into action. The black community cannot do it alone. This will require all of us.</a></p> \n     <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A post shared by <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/drewbrees/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading\" style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;\" target=\"_blank\"> Drew Brees</a> (@drewbrees) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2020-06-06T02:10:07+00:00\">Jun 5, 2020 at 7:10pm PDT</time></p>\n    </div>\n   </blockquote> \n   <script async src=\"//www.instagram.com/embed.js\"></script> \n  </figure> \n  <p>\u201cTo @realdonaldtrump.

  "<p>History teaches that mass protests against oppression can lead either to liberation or brutal repression.</p> <p>This past week, Donald Trump bet his political future on repression. Much of the rest of America, on the other hand, wants to liberate black people from police brutality and centuries of systemic racism. As of this writing, it looks like Trump is losing and America winning, but the contest is hardly over.</p> <p>Trump knows he can\u2019t be re-elected on his disastrous response to the coronavirus pandemic or on what\u2019s likely to be a tepid economic recovery.

We must reject and hold accountable those in office who would make a mockery of our constitution.\u201d</p> <p>It was an \u201cemperor-has-no-clothes\u201d moment that prompted the Republican senator Lisa Murkowski to admit she was considering not voting for Trump and suggest other Senate Republicans felt the same way.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cPerhaps we\u2019re getting to the point where we can be more honest with the concerns that we might hold internally and have the courage of our own convictions to speak up,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Trump expected white voters to recoil from the rioting and looting.

All have grants from a Chan Zuckerberg Initiative program working to prevent, cure and treat neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s disease.</p> <p>They said the letter had more than 160 signatories. Shepherd said about 10% were employees of foundations run by Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan.</p> <p>The letter objects specifically to Zuckerberg\u2019s decision <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/jun/05/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-trump-policies-review\">not to act on a post</a> by Trump that stated \u201cwhen the looting starts, the shooting starts\u201d. The letter\u2019s authors called the post \u201ca clear statement of inciting violence\u201d.</p> <p>Zuckerberg has faced significant backlash, including from Facebook staff, over the choice not to remove Trump\u2019s post this week amid nationwide protests over police brutality. Twitter had both flagged and demoted a Trump tweet using the same language.</p> <p>In a statement, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative noted that the philanthropic organization was separate from Facebook and said \u201cwe are grateful for our staff, partners and grantees\u201d and \u201crespect their right to voice their opinions, including on Facebook policies\u201d.</p> <p>Some Facebook employees have publicly objected to Zuckerberg\u2019s refusal to take down or label misleading or incendiary posts by Trump and other politicians. But Zuckerberg has so far refused.</p> <p>On Friday, Zuckerberg said in a post that he would review \u201cpotential options for handling violating or partially-violating content aside from the binary leave-it-up or take-it-down decisions\u201d.</p>"
