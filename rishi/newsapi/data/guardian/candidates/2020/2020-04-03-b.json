  "<p>The Trump administration decided to end a $200m early warning program designed to alert it to potential pandemics just three months before it is believed Covid-19 began infecting people in China.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/31/us-coronavirus-budget-cuts-trump-underprepared\">US underprepared for coronavirus due to Trump cuts, say health experts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The project, called Predict, had been run by the US Agency for International Development since 2009. It had identified more than 160 different coronaviruses that had the potential to develop into pandemics, including a virus that is considered the closest known relative to Covid-19.</p> <p>A decision to wind down the program was made, however, in September, just three months before the first reports of people becoming infected with Covid-19 in Wuhan, China. The end of the program saw the departure of dozens of scientists and analysts working to identify potential pandemics in countries around the world, including China.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a genius, visionary program that USAid took a big risk to fund and it\u2019s a crying shame it was canceled,\u201d said Peter Daszak, president of EcoHealth Alliance, a non-profit specialist in tackling wildlife-borne disease that was one of the major partners in the program.</p> <p>Daszak said he did not know why the initiative was scrapped or if the White House played any direct role in its ending. EcoHealth Alliance has been given a temporary extension to work on the program but the role will finally come to a close in September.</p> <p>The news about Predict\u2019s demise was <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2020-04-02/coronavirus-trump-pandemic-program-viruses-detection\">first reported </a>in the Los Angeles Times.</p> <p>Predict\u2019s work focused on the dangers of viruses spreading from wildlife to humans and causing possible pandemics like the Covid-19 outbreak that has resulted in much of the world grinding to a halt. It is suspected that Covid-19 made the leap to humans from a bat sold at a Wuhan market.</p> <p>Daszak said there are an estimated 1.7m mystery viruses in wildlife that may have the potential to transfer to humans and cause another pandemic, making the early detection of these diseases imperative for public health and economic reasons.</p> <p>\u201cWe should\u2019ve been more unsettled about this before all this happened,\u201d he said. \u201cWe got a lot of flak for spending money in other countries but just think how much even a few billion would be worth to stop this sort of pandemic. It\u2019s sad to see the project finish because it\u2019s the way of the future, in 50 years they will be bog-standard.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not confident we will learn the lessons from this, though. We saw the same thing happen after Ebola and then Zika. We are always behind with pandemics, we are flying blind. We have hit the snooze button several times and now here\u2019s the big one.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s not clear whether a continuation of the project would have dampened the current pandemic, although the Trump administration has faced criticism for its preparation before the outbreak. The administration reduced a team working in China on pandemics and has repeatedly attempted to cut funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p> <p>A spokesman for USAid told the Los Angeles Times that the Predict program was \u201cjust one component of USAid\u2019s global health security efforts and accounted for less than 20% of our global health security funding\u201d. A new initiative to help prevent the spread of diseases from animals to humans is due to start later this year.</p>",

One election official said he feels \u201csick\u201d asking people to work the polls, knowing it could kill them. Others have advised some voters to isolate their mail-in ballot envelopes for 24 hours before getting a witness to sign it to avoid spreading the virus.

Days ahead of the election, Neil Albrecht, executive director of the city\u2019s elections commission, didn\u2019t know where those sites would be or who would staff them. The city usually requires 1,400 poll workers, but had just 400 earlier this week.</p> <p>\u201cWe are over our heads in chaos right now,\u201d Albrecht said. \u201cThe level of public confusion will be so rampant and the access to voting will be so limited.</p> <p>On Friday, Wisconsin\u2019s governor, Tony Evers, <a href=\"https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/WIGOV/2020/04/03/file_attachments/1418891/EO073-SpecialSessionElections%20final.pdf\">ordered the </a><a href=\"https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/WIGOV/2020/04/03/file_attachments/1418891/EO073-SpecialSessionElections%20final.pdf\">legislature to meet</a> in special session at 4pm on Saturday to decide the fate of the election.

The 7 April election will be the most significant test of whether a state can safely conduct a fair election amid a global pandemic.</p> <p>So far, using aggressive public messaging, Wisconsin has successfully convinced more than 1.2 of its 3.3 million voters to request a mail-in ballot. That is unprecedented \u2013 in its 2016 spring election, the state issued just under 250,000 mail-in ballots.</p> <p>But there is still deep concern that confusion and rules around mail-in voting will leave many unable to participate. On Thursday,<a href=\"https://www.wispolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/200402Order-1.pdf\"> a federal judge</a> ordered the state to ease some of its restrictions around absentee balloting. Republicans are appealing the ruling.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be imperfect, some voters will be disenfranchised,\u201d said Barry Burden, director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be inequality and access to the ballot that will affect the election outcome.\u201d<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/apr/2020-04-03T14:02:07/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Graph detailing the number of absentee ballot requests in Wisconsin\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/apr/2020-04-03T14:02:07/embed.html\">Graph detailing the number of absentee ballot requests in Wisconsin</a> </figure>  <p>The hurdles could impact the state\u2019s presidential primary election, local races and a critical contest for a state supreme court seat where Democrats are looking to narrow the conservative majority.</p> <p>Until Friday, Evers, a Democrat, <a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/03/17/tony-evers-sticking-wisconsins-april-7-presidential-primary/5073696002/\">has rebuffed</a> calls to postpone the election, citing the need to fill local offices in the state as terms expire and saying he does not have unilateral authority to move the primary. In late March, Evers called for mailing an absentee ballot to every voter, a Sisyphean feat so close to election day. Democrats <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/02/tony-evers-wisconsin-democrats-primary-election-161423\">have criticized</a> Evers\u2019 response, and Republicans who control the Legislature immediately called it a \u201c<a href=\"https://apnews.com/687cbb0e6a162b8f3e831a2e5cf76d85\">fantasy</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Meanwhile, voters applying for mail-in ballots have been faced with confusion around the quickly changing rules. Normally Wisconsin requires people to submit a picture of their ID to get an absentee ballot, and all voters needed a witness to sign their ballot. These restrictions have been especially hard for senior citizens, as well as students and other people who move a lot, Burden said.</p> <p>Patricia Ginter, a 72-year-old real estate agent who lives alone in Wauwatosa, said in <a href=\"https://642cf75b-6e65-4c0d-82e2-11357e0523f7.filesusr.com/ugd/85cfb4_fd5031b5c752493fa160525360716d99.pdf?index=true\">a court filing</a> she has only left her house once in the last few weeks to go to the grocery store. She filled out her absentee ballot, but has no way of getting a witness because she\u2019s in isolation. Ginter is a plaintiff in one of several federal lawsuits challenging restrictions around Wisconsin absentee ballots.</p> <p>A Wisconsin elections commission <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KLQBN-KEwY1v9PGNvL8uNpzaPph7U7dP/view?usp=sharing\">memo</a> said people like Ginter could rely on delivery people to observe voters filling out their ballot through a window, or mail the witness certificate to someone who could observe over video chat. Lawyers representing Ginter and the other plaintiffs called those guidelines unworkable.</p> <p>On Thursday, however, the US district judge William Conley eased some of those rules and said Wisconsin voters could submit an absentee ballot without a witness signature if they provided a declaration they could not get one, and left local clerks with the authority to determine validity. He said cities like Milwaukee, which has already received hundreds of ballots without witness signatures, could count them with the declaration as well.</p> <p>The judge called the election \u201cill-advised\u201d but <a href=\"https://www.wispolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/200402Order-1.pdf\">said he had no authority to stop it</a>.</p> <p>Meanwhile Wisconsin\u2019s controversial identification rules have not been eased. Officials in Madison said Wednesday they received over a thousand requests for a mail-in ballot from people without acceptable ID \u2013 about half of which were from senior citizens.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MadisonWIClerk/status/1245456746384064512\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We are unable to process over 1,100 absentee requests because we do not have the voter&#39;s ID on file.

He requested his absentee ballot on 26 March, but as of Thursday had yet to receive it. The local clerk\u2019s office told him his ballot was sent to an address in a different town. \u201cIt\u2019s been such a confusing process so far,\u201d he said.</p> <p>To account for the severe delays, Conley extended the deadline by which local election officials have to receive ballots from 8pm on election night to nearly a week later, at 4pm on 13 April. Conley <a href=\"https://twitter.com/srl/status/1246113340004450305\">also blocked</a> election officials from releasing election results until the later date.</p> <p>The change will probably allow thousands of Wisconsin voters to have their votes counted. And provide relief to election officials like Albrecht, who said he needs 300 workers to count ballots and had less than 50.</p> <p>Local officials still plan to run a small number of in-person voting sites \u2013 significant because voters can register to vote on election day. In previous spring elections, about 20% of voters in Milwaukee made use of that process, Albrecht said, and disproportionately voters of color.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we talk about communities in poverty, which is where we\u2019re seeing the hotspots of the pandemic, getting to the voting center may not be as accessible to you,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But the Wisconsin elections commission reported a shortage of at least 7,000 poll workers. And there is valid reason for many of them to drop out: poll workers tend to skew older, the demographic most likely to develop severe complications from Covid-19. <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/article241539451.html\">Two poll workers in Florida</a> tested positive for coronavirus after the election there last month.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e9a727943f6127c2ad01ecc4295ffd264cd78e6d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9a727943f6127c2ad01ecc4295ffd264cd78e6d/0_0_3900_2600/1000..jpg\" alt=\"FILE - In this Feb. 18, 2020 file photo poll worker Bill Martens mans the ballot machine and \u201cI Voted: stickers at the Hart Park Muellner Building in Wauwatosa, Wis.

The dominant issue was aged care. A senior official familiar with the discussion on that day insists that only Queensland, which had already declared a health emergency, and New South Wales, had a sharp grasp of what was coming. Victoria was slow, but would come in forcefully later. \u201cThere really was no national leadership at that point,\u201d the official says.</p> <p>Morrison and the government would doubtless contest this assessment by pointing to the steady accumulation of action since 20 January. The government was also beginning to talk itself around on the likely need for fiscal stimulus. The first package of measures was in its infancy.</p> <p>But the clear impression from the states in late February, at least at the health intersection point, was Canberra hadn\u2019t yet locked on just how bad the Covid-19 health crisis would ultimately get.</p> <p>In March, the operating tempo would change.</p> <p>Two key events would drag the federation of Australia into the new normal.</p> <h2>The week that changed everything</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/03/australia-coronavirus-lockdown-rules-nsw-victoria-qld-queensland-explained-can-i-visit-my-partner-family-friends-walk-dog\">Australia's coronavirus lockdown rules explained: can I still visit my partner and other questions</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Covid-19 pandemic is an extraordinary event.

Schools would be closed, entire workforces would be working from home, sporting events would be cancelled. \u201cThat time will come,\u201d Andrews said. \u201cWe are going to ask a lot of Victorians.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"fdd6cb1901e32ffb7270786b25b537c78f142ba0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fdd6cb1901e32ffb7270786b25b537c78f142ba0/0_0_5369_3376/1000..jpg\" alt=\"The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, inspects an ICU pod with the state\u2019s health minister, Jenny Mikakos, on 10 March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"629\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, inspects an ICU pod at Royal Melbourne hospital with the state\u2019s health minister, Jenny Mikakos, on 10 March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Crosling/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Two days later, in Canberra, Morrison launched the first fiscal stimulus package, which was predicated on businesses being open, at least in some form, and consumers being able to spend. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/12/six-million-low-income-earners-to-receive-750-cash-under-coalitions-coronavirus-stimulus\">He told reporters</a> he was confident the targeted measures would be enough to \u201cdo the job\u201d of propping up the economy. If more was needed, there was always the budget in May.</p> <p>By the evening of 12 March, the premiers and chief ministers were at Kirribilli House with Morrison for a social gathering ahead of Coag the next day. Some of the leaders noticed when Andrews hung back when others left. The Victorian premier congratulated the prime minister on the stimulus, but predicted government assistance would shortly need to tick over into survival payments. Swathes of the economy were going to have to shut down.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Morrison was visibly annoyed the health guidance had changed in what felt like the blink of an eye</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>By the time the leaders woke the next day and made their way out to Parramatta stadium, which was the venue for the Coag talks, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/13/australia-coronavirus-live-news-formula-one-f1-gp-grand-prix-melbourne-australian-government-stimulus-economic-package-asx200-latest-updates\">the world had reached 130,000 Covid-19 cases</a>, and more than 4,700 deaths had been recorded.

Live coverage could barely keep pace with events. But inside the cavernous football stadium, the Coag meeting started with the preordained agenda. There were briefings from the Reserve Bank of Australia and from Treasury. Murphy, the chief medical officer, also supplied a detailed briefing. The leaders then broke for a cup of tea.</p> <p>Running parallel with the leaders, health advisers from the states were also conferring by teleconference. Murphy was shuttling between the leaders meeting and the teleconference. Victoria, which had recorded the first case of community transmission that Friday, and Queensland, pushed during the discussion for stronger and more urgent action to force social distancing. People familiar with the dynamic in the meeting of medical officers insist it wasn\u2019t a boil over, but the forward-leaning states insisted more was needed. They sought a consensus to craft new, stronger, recommendations to be put to the leaders.</p> <p>Murphy conveyed that shift to the leaders meeting. That news hit the group like a thunderclap. Morrison was visibly annoyed the health guidance had changed in what felt like the blink of an eye. Officials were promptly turfed out of the room and the leaders were left in a huddle, in a cavernous, empty football stadium in western Sydney, to determine what to do next.</p> <p>The table had been set for lunch. Lunch didn\u2019t happen. Tumult happened. But within the hour, entirely on the hop, nine political leaders had invented a new governance structure. No papers, no proposals, no guidance from officials. Morrison suggested they manage the crisis by convening regularly as a national cabinet. The proposal materialised in the room. The states agreed and insisted the group just be them, first ministers \u2013 no opposition leaders.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/02/free-childcare-what-do-the-governments-coronavirus-changes-mean-for-my-family\">Free childcare: what do the Australian government's coronavirus changes mean for my family?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The group created an emergency national government of nine. Morrison later bolted in the national cabinet as a subcommittee of the regular cabinet.</p> <p>The leaders then moved to the discussion about imposing new limits on crowds, and how that would be announced to the public. There was a debate about when the proposed restriction should commence. Now, or Monday? Did people need to be given notice given it was now mid-afternoon on a Friday and events were scheduled for the weekend? There was a view some notice was required.</p> <p>Morrison war gamed in the leaders huddle about whether going to the opening game of the NRL season on Saturday night \u2013 something the prime minister had been foregrounding for days \u2013 would be a good or a bad signal. Would people be unsettled if he suddenly wasn\u2019t going? The leaders resolved the position they would telegraph, and emerged, and Morrison announced there would be a ban on non-essential gatherings of 500, effective Monday. The prime minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/video/2020/mar/13/scott-morrison-defends-decision-to-attend-rugby-league-game-during-coronavirus-outbreak-video\">said he\u2019d be going to the football on Saturday night</a> because there was no cause for alarm, and \u201cit might be the last game I get to go to for a very long time\u201d.</p> <p>The day wasn\u2019t yet over. Shortly after the leaders scattered, there was another bombshell. The home affairs minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-peter-dutton-tests-positive-to-covid-19-after-returning-to-australia-from-us\">Peter Dutton had been infected with the virus, likely during a trip to America</a>.

The story bounced quickly into American news outlets.</p> <p>By 7.30pm on Friday night, Morrison was not going to watch his beloved Sharks.</p> <h2>State-federal tensions boil over</h2> <p>The rapid recalibration at Coag was the first of two gear changes. The next one played out over the following weekend.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/28/australias-coronavirus-toll-covid-19-related-deaths-across-the-country\">Australia\u2019s coronavirus toll: Covid-19 related deaths across the country</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Covid-19 is a health crisis that has triggered the most profound economic shock since the global financial crisis. Morrison has told colleagues the impact of this pandemic will be more far-reaching than the Depression. As the world wobbles, Australia is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/australian-prime-minister-to-ask-global-leaders-to-fund-urgent-research-for-coronavirus-vaccine\">worried about failed states</a>, and the risk of a global sovereign debt crisis.</p> <p>The national government is responsible for economic wellbeing. This crisis has triggered a legitimate dialogue between the tiers of government about protecting lives and livelihoods; how to craft public health measures that save lives without deepening an economic crisis that would threaten wellbeing in other ways. Morrison wanted to craft measures that would enable Australia\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/overseas-arrivals-to-australia-to-be-quarantined-in-hotels-for-two-weeks-over-coronavirus\">economy to move into a period of hibernation</a>, and he wanted to sequence the inevitable health restrictions to flatten the curve of infections with bursts of significant fiscal firepower.</p> <p>The economic response to this crisis is massive, as it was a decade ago during the global financial crisis. The Morrison government is drawing on the central bank, on the Council of Financial Regulators, on the retail banks, on big corporates, on coordination commissions. Public servants are being redeployed to frontline agencies. Sacked call centre workers are being picked up by Centrelink, and working in contact-tracing call centres in the states. Morrison and Frydenberg are talking regularly to their counterparts overseas.</p> <p>While the economy is largely Canberra\u2019s problem, the states manage health systems, and there was concern in the two most populous states that tough restrictions necessary to stop infections were not moving fast enough. Which brings us to the events of the weekend of 21 and 22 March.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Ruby Princess, the boat two Coalition governments failed to stop, would cause a spike in infections</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It was this weekend where the inevitable tension in the federation between saving jobs and preventing unmanageable numbers of ICU patients reached its peak, and manifested publicly as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/as-australia-goes-off-the-coronavirus-cliff-the-question-is-how-hard-will-it-land\">sonic boom Sunday</a>.</p> <p>The NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian, had endured a terrible few days.

A tipping point had been reached.</p> <p>In Canberra, Morrison was hunkered down with colleagues finalising the government\u2019s second stimulus package. The plan was to unveil the $66bn worth of new measures on Sunday. Journalists were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/22/scott-morrison-to-announce-66bn-stimulus-including-income-support-for-workers\">briefed late on Saturday</a> so stories could appear in the Sunday papers and on the political shows.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2020/apr/03/how-has-the-morrison-government-responded-to-the-coronavirus-crisis-australian-politics-live-podcast\">How has the Morrison government responded to the coronavirus crisis? \u2013 Australian politics live podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But in Sydney and Melbourne, Berejiklian and Andrews were alarmed. They felt public health restrictions needed to be imposed more quickly, because people were ignoring polite entreaties from politicians and chief medical officers. Canberra was not blocking action, but a dialogue about how hard to go with social distancing restrictions that would force businesses to close remained unresolved.</p> <p>Berejiklian and Andrews were in touch throughout Saturday, into Saturday night and then again Sunday morning. Berejiklian told Morrison on Saturday night that NSW and Victoria wanted to implement the first stage of restrictions pronto \u2013 the closure of places like pubs and clubs. She said the two states were prepared to move ahead of other jurisdictions if there wasn\u2019t prompt consensus through the national cabinet.</p> <p>Not all states were persuaded that it was time to force widespread lockdowns, and worried they would be dragged along in the slipstream when there wasn\u2019t a solid evidence base. Politically it would be hard for premiers to explain to their constituents why some states were moving and they were not. One official from another state says: \u201cWe [were] moving ahead of the health advice, and all the political pressure is to go further; to be out in front of this\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The story had been briefed to Canberra reporters at a time to capture national attention, while Morrison was on his feet</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But the ACT was fully on board with the NSW/Victoria view that stage one lockdowns had to happen, and now. The chief minister, Andrew Barr, noted there could not be one rule for Canberra and another for Queanbeyan. A leaders meeting scheduled originally for Tuesday had been brought forward to Sunday evening.</p> <p>The two premiers were not mucking around. Morrison was in his courtyard in Canberra about two-thirds of the way through unveiling stimulus round two when a reporter from the Nine Network asked the prime minister to comment on a new push by NSW and Victoria \u201cfor a total shutdown on non-essential businesses\u201d.

He responded by saying he would be guided by the health advice that was currently being prepared by the chief medical officers. If he had a view, he would be expressing it in the national cabinet, not on the hop to journalists. \u201cThat\u2019s the orderly and calm way to deal with these things, and to make decisions in a responsible manner.\u201d</p> <p>Public statements from the two states followed confirming that was in fact the position: restrictions needed to happen, and they were prepared to go in advance of others. Victoria upped the ante by signalling it would close schools from Tuesday. The national cabinet had been jolted into more urgency on the health side. The view in the states intent on pushing the envelope was this was a necessary jolt, delivered just in the nick of time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"84a39b5d533f2a1fb5af3d19ebada1cd6b940863\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/84a39b5d533f2a1fb5af3d19ebada1cd6b940863/0_0_6720_4480/1000..jpg\" alt=\"A sign out the front of a restaurant in Surry Hills after pubs, clubs and cafes were closed for dining in.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A sign out the front of a restaurant in Surry Hills after pubs, clubs and cafes were closed for dining in.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carly Earl/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Later that night, after the national cabinet discussion, Morrison fronted the cameras and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/victoria-nsw-lockdowns-scott-morrison-coronavirus-national-cabinet\">confirmed pubs and clubs would close</a>. Restaurants and cafes would be restricted to takeaway only. Schools, confusingly, seemed to be both open and closed.</p> <p>Given the obvious tumult of the day, Morrison also felt compelled to affirm the national cabinet had not splintered. The self-created government of nine had mauled, inelegantly, to a point of consensus. It has weathered its first big test. \u201cAll of its members are very committed to its processes and decisions,\u201d the prime minister said.</p> <h2>The new normal</h2> <p>This pandemic is close. It casts a shadow. \u201cWe are all next to it,\u201d Josh Frydenberg tells Guardian Australia while downing a late dinner in his Canberra digs one night this week. As the treasurer was working up the third economic support package in as many weeks \u2013 the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/30/from-tight-purse-strings-to-massive-fiscal-firepower-the-coalitions-staggering-transformation\">$130bn for wages subsidies the government unfurled early this week</a> \u2013 his cousin was seriously ill in intensive care in a Melbourne hospital. Frydenberg\u2019s cousin had picked up the virus during a trip to London with his wife, and soon succumbed to a high temperature and breathing difficulties. Fortunately, he is now recovering well.</p> <p>After the watershed weekend in March, the public health restrictions have only gathered pace. Stage one was followed quickly by stages two and three. One of the recent national cabinets decreed that gatherings would go from 10 to two. Some insiders say the health advice going into the meeting was to maintain the restriction at 10, but leaders defaulted to two. Queensland pushed for one of the more recent measures \u2013 quarantining returning travellers in hotels. The state argued that particular measure would have the biggest positive impact on infection rates without inflicting more pain on the general community.</p> <p>Messaging at the beginning was confusing, and at times contradictory. But the public health messaging has become simpler, and more forceful. Stay home, unless there is a very good reason to go out. The commonwealth meanwhile keeps rolling out economic support. Wages subsidies. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/02/free-childcare-what-do-the-governments-coronavirus-changes-mean-for-my-family\">Free childcare</a>, at least for some.

It is disconcerting. Gathering places that once teemed with life are empty. States are walled off. The businesses still open wonder when they will have to close their doors. The federal parliament is only sitting in short sessions to pass specific measures. Liberty has been curtailed by emergency powers now in place across all the states and territories, enforced by state police. It is reasonable to wonder how long the public will consent to these arrangements. Australia is a vibrant, noisy, democracy, not a police state.</p> <p>Things feel grim, because they are grim. The suspension of ordinary existence is absolutely necessary in the service of saving lives, but we have entered a new normal that could persist not for six months, which is the timeframe invoked most regularly by political leaders, but for a year. Or two.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Governments had to go further and deeper because of the lack of community buy-in initially</p> <footer> <cite>Dr Tony Bartone</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The medical profession remains on the fence about whether the governments of Australia are currently getting the balance right. The president of the Australian Medical Association, Tony Bartone, tells Guardian Australia that can only be judged with the benefit of hindsight. \u201cThe truth of the matter is governments had to go further and deeper because of the lack of community buy-in initially,\u201d Bartone says.</p> <p>\u201cWe can raise all number of reasons about why that\u2019s the case including mixed messaging, poor information and communication, and indifference by younger sections of the community who thought it was an old person\u2019s disease and they didn\u2019t have to worry. For all those reasons, governments have had to take the community on a conversation.\u201d</p> <p>Bartone also cautions against some of the optimistic commentary that has emerged over the course of the past week that Australia has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/datablog/2020/apr/01/is-australia-flattening-the-coronavirus-curve-look-at-the-charts-\">begun to flatten the curve of new infections</a>. \u201cWe are flattening it but remember that also, we had a big spike in numbers last week and previously because half the Australian population abroad returned home before the lockdowns.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/datablog/2020/apr/01/is-australia-flattening-the-coronavirus-curve-look-at-the-charts-\">Is Australia flattening the coronavirus curve?

I sent him a text the other night to say no prime minister in our lifetime has had to face down something as significant as this, and that national cabinet is working extremely well, and this was a fantastic suggestion from him and we are all very grateful to be acting as one government almost, if you like, across the country rather than nine of us doing our own thing.\u201d</p> <p>He says the federation creates a tension reflecting divided responsibilities. \u201cThere is that tension, that\u2019s perfectly healthy and appropriate. It\u2019s a big thing to close businesses and see people stood down. These are massive decisions to make and there is a very big toll that comes with that including anxiety and all sorts of other issues, often tragic issues, like increased family violence rates for instance and all sorts of other mental health considerations. It\u2019s not a bad thing that we are all grappling with that very difficult choice, trying to smash the virus and trying to preserve the economy as much as we can.\u201d</p> <p>Barr says the ad hoc government of nine is learning on its feet. \u201cWe are getting there now but we weren\u2019t quite there initially around fully appreciating how much the health curve would impact on the economic outcome. I think that gap is now being closed.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s been a few things that in hindsight you would like to have got there a week to 10 days earlier, but we have got there, sometimes just in time. What I would like to see in the next phase of this is we are not playing catch-up so much; that we are shaping the future a bit more rather than reacting to the past.\u201d</p> <p>Barr insists the national cabinet has brought out the best in the federation, and could, in fact, be a segue to a newer, more effective style of politics and governance. \u201cThis mechanism has forced cooperation that we haven\u2019t seen before. The level of information sharing is much improved from the case before.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/30/australia-coronavirus-shutdown-rules-stage-3-not-lockdown-what-is-closed-open-restrictions\">Australia coronavirus shutdown: what is open, closed and banned under the current rules?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIf you were observing that national cabinet from outside and you knew nothing about Australian politics you wouldn\u2019t know which side of the fence people were on.

  "<p>Even in these extraordinary times, the sight of the president of the United States presenting a slide which announced as a \u201cgoal\u201d the death of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/donald-trump-coronavirus-briefing-painful-us-deaths\" title=\"\">up to 240,000</a> of its citizens was almost beyond belief. To hit the lowest end of the target, a staggering 100,000 American deaths, would show that his administration had done \u201ca very good job\u201d, Donald Trump claimed this week. The highest end would be more than double the US casualties in the first world war. This could only be considered a positive outcome because the alternative is so shocking: without mitigation measures, if people fail to stay at home as advised, the US could be heading for between 1.5 million and 2.2 million deaths.</p> <p>The US is now the new centre of the pandemic, with more than a fifth of the million cases reported worldwide, and more than 5,000 deaths. The vast majority of Americans \u2013 more than 300 million \u2013 are now under some form of lockdown, though the stringency of restrictions varies greatly and a few states are still holding out. Those measures have come too late to stop hospitals from being overwhelmed.</p> <p>The richest country in the world is structurally ill-equipped to cope with such a crisis. The lack of universal healthcare or basic employment rights such as statutory sick pay, and the low incomes on which so many Americans survive, are conducive to the spread of disease and to it having the most serious consequences.</p> <p>But an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/28/trump-coronavirus-politics-us-health-disaster\" title=\"\">utter failure of leadership</a> \u2013 the lack of will, intelligence, basic competence or even consistency on the part of the Trump administration \u2013 has turbocharged the problem. And without the work of state governors and institutions, who have pre-empted the administration and gone far beyond it in taking action, matters would be even worse. Mr Trump has at best left them to fend for themselves and at worst actively hindered the fight against coronavirus.</p> <p>His culpability actually predates the virus\u2019s emergence in China. The administration <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/24/trump-cuts-undermine-coronavirus-containment-cdc-watchdog-report\" title=\"\">got rid of most of the staff</a> who worked on identifying global health problems in China, while repeatedly attempting to slash funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A comprehensive document on battling pandemics, drawn up under the Obama administration, was \u201cthrown on to a shelf\u201d by its successor. Only last October, an internal federal government report warned that the US was woefully underprepared and underfunded to tackle a virus without a cure.</p> <p>Even after the virus was confirmed to have reached the US, Mr Trump downplayed the crisis at every opportunity, fearing the impact on the economy. As late as 25 February he called it \u201cvery well under control\u201d. He has touted unproven remedies. Last week, he said he wanted to reopen large sections of the country <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/24/trump-coronavirus-us-easter-new-york-fauci-birx\" title=\"\">by Easter</a> and to see \u201cpacked churches all over our country\u201d \u2013 though he has, thankfully, since extended the federal \u201cstay at home\u201d guidance until the end of this month. The federal government should have mobilised long ago to acquire an appropriate supply of testing kits, protective equipment and ventilators. It did not. This week, he was forced to acknowledge that the government\u2019s emergency stockpile of protective equipment is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/01/trump-coronavirus-stockpile-ppe-briefing\" title=\"\">almost exhausted</a>.</p> <p>The economy is reeling. An astonishing 6.6 million Americans signed on for unemployment welfare last week. The emergency <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/senate-passes-coronavirus-stimulus-package\" title=\"\">$2tn relief package</a>, while necessary and welcome, offers more to corporate America than those on the breadline.</p> <p>Some wonder if this could finally break his spell. So far, people are rallying around the flag: a national crisis tends to prompt people to support the leadership. Despite his dereliction of duty, Mr Trump\u2019s approval ratings have actually increased, as they have for leaders <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/c7f5a8bc-eb0e-45e5-a080-bbfd6d317def\" title=\"\">in almost every democratic nation</a>. He may also benefit from the rock-bottom expectations people have of him. And he is already trying to rewrite the facts and pin the blame on others, attacking governors both for failing to prepare and for hoarding equipment.</p> <p>These efforts may yet succeed. But the truth is that, as he has finally acknowledged, the coming weeks will be \u201cvery, very painful\u201d \u2013 and that his inaction has made them much more so.</p>",
  "<p>Between 1990 and 2004, Joe Diffie was one of the most commercially successful artists in country music, notching up more than 30 singles on Billboard\u2019s country chart, including five No 1s. Diffie, who has died aged 61 after contracting Covid-19, built up a huge and loyal following with songs based around shrewd observations of everyday life, which he performed with rambunctious rowdiness and easygoing humour.</p> <p>It was in this uncomplicated spirit that he recorded hits such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz6zIpW8z1w\" title=\"\">Bigger Than the Beatles</a> (No 1 in 1995), the tale of love between a waitress and a hotel lounge singer featuring a crafty nod to the Beatles\u2019 She Loves You. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6AwQPW6myWo\" title=\"\">John Deere Green</a> (No 5, 1993) entwined the John Deere tractor, traditionally dear to the hearts of American farmers, with the lifelong romance of Billy Bob and Charlene. Perhaps his philosophy was best captured in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMiEFyTuuh8\" title=\"\">Prop Me Up Beside the Jukebox (If I Die)</a> \u2013 No 3 in 1993 \u2013 in which Diffie sang: \u201cFill my boots up with sand, put a stiff drink in my hand / Prop me up beside the jukebox if I die.\u201d</p> <p>Diffie was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma. His mother, Flora, was a schoolteacher and also ran a flower shop. His father, Joe, held a variety of jobs including rancher, truck driver and welder, and would later become the tour bus driver for the country artist Toby Keith. Joe Sr also played the guitar and banjo, while Flora was a singer, and Joe Jr began singing while still an infant. At 14 he launched his performing career by appearing with his aunt Dawn Anita\u2019s country band. The family moved around between San Antonio, Texas, Washington State and Wisconsin before settling in Velma, Oklahoma, where Joe attended high school. </p> <p>He developed his skills as a musician and harmony singer with a variety of gospel and bluegrass groups including Higher Purpose and Special Edition. He lived for a time in Duncan, Oklahoma, where he worked in a foundry and played in local bars and dancehalls, but the foundry closed and his first marriage, to Janise Parker, broke up.</p> <p>In 1986 he moved to Nashville, determined to succeed in the music business. While working during the day with Gibson guitars, he focused on his songwriting and sang on demo recordings. He enjoyed a breakthrough in 1988, when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/nov/27/guardianobituaries.obituaries1\" title=\"\">Hank Thompson</a>, the \u201cking of western swing\u201d, recorded his song Love On the Rocks. \u201cThere\u2019s really no magic formula,\u201d Diffie commented, about his songwriting. \u201cI\u2019ve just always drawn on my own experience, whether it\u2019s falling in love or hanging out in a bar. I feel like if I can relate to it, other people will too.\u201d</p> <p>A deal with Epic Records followed, and Diffie\u2019s debut album, A Thousand Winding Roads, appeared in 1990. This gave him his first country No 1 hit with his debut single <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6y7Aa9aSkM\" title=\"\">Home</a>, a showcase for his smooth and supple voice and the beginning of a streak of six consecutive Top 5 singles including another chart-topper, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sdutns1wWXg\" title=\"\">If the Devil Danced (In Empty Pockets)</a>.</p> <p>He was inducted into the Grand Ole Opry in 1993, a year when he also released the platinum-selling album Honky Tonk Attitude. The following year brought his most successful long-player, Third Rock from the Sun, which reached 6 on the US country chart. This contained one of his biggest hits, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9I51JXpcLwk\" title=\"\">Pickup Man</a>, which played on the double entendre of sexual attraction and pickup trucks \u2013 \u201cI met all my wives in traffic jams / There\u2019s just something women like about a pickup man\u201d.</p> <p>In 1998 he won a Grammy for his appearance on a star-studded recording of Same Old Train with Emmylou Harris, Marty Stuart, Merle Haggard and others. His songs were frequently covered by other artists, including <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-A5LqcqiqEw\" title=\"\">Memory Lane by Tim McGraw</a>, and Jo Dee Messina\u2019s take on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o40fwZgSFPI\" title=\"\">My Give a Damn\u2019s Busted</a>. In 2013, Jason Aldean\u2019s song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Wsfi3fB70\" title=\"\">1994</a> name-checked several of Diffie\u2019s hits, and contained a chorus consisting of the chant \u201cJoe, Joe, Joe Diffie!\u201d This supplied Diffie with the title of his final album, released in 2019.</p> <p>Diffie was three times divorced. He is survived by his fourth wife, Tara Terpening, whom he married in 2018, and by four sons, Parker, Travis, Drew and Tyler, and two daughters, Kara and Kylie.</p> <p>\u2022 Joseph Logan Diffie, musician, singer and songwriter, born 28 December 1958; died 29 March 2020</p>",

  "<p>The trump card of Donald Trump was always going to be the economy. If it wasn\u2019t the job market, it was the stock market. You could read it every day in his endless, mindless tweeting or the oh-so-subtle briefings of his campaign aides. November was going to be all about the economy, stupid.</p> <p>Having ripped off so much of Ronald Reagan\u2019s 1980s paraphernalia \u2013 including <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/make-america-great-again-who-said-it-first-n645716\">the slogan</a> he now claims to have invented himself \u2013 Trump was all set to ask the voters the same question that Reagan posed just before his own re-election: are you better off than you were four years ago?</p> <p>For an astonishingly large number of Americans, their answer is a deafeningly loud no. For almost everyone else, the answer is soon to be no.</p> <p>This week\u2019s unemployment numbers have taken the same rocket-ship trajectory as the number of coronavirus cases. Last week it was a record 3.3 million new claims; this week it doubled to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/02/us-unemployment-coronavirus-economy\">another 6.65 million new claims</a>. That\u2019s almost 10 million newly unemployed Americans: more than the previous 10 months combined.</p> <p>Experts already believe that the unemployment rate has jumped from historic lows of 3.5% to numbers we haven\u2019t seen since the Great Depression of around 17%. You don\u2019t need to be an expert to know we have yet to reach peak pain.</p> <p>We can argue about what number represents the greatest suffering in this pandemic: the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2020/apr/02/coronavirus-map-of-the-us-latest-cases-state-by-state\">number of the victims</a> or the unemployed. Each one of the people affected \u2013 by the virus and by the virus-led recession \u2013 is more important to consider than the fate of one man watching cable television in the White House.</p> <p>But we also need to talk about the carnival barker who played a businessman on reality TV for a few years. Because we have never seen someone more ill-suited for leadership at a time of crisis. The history books tell us about Herbert Hoover\u2019s failures to intervene to stop the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/21/100-years-on-another-great-depression-coronavirus-fiscal-response\">Great Depression</a>. They tell us about James Buchanan\u2019s support for slavery and his failure to head off the secession of the slave states.</p> <p>Still, Trump stands alone: an incredibly shrinking man who looks and sounds smaller as the numbers of dead and unemployed grow ever larger. Even George W Bush\u2019s epically disastrous war in Iraq pales into insignificance. More Americans have died from this pandemic than in Bush\u2019s war of choice: more than 6,000 dead at the most recent <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">count</a>.</p> <p>Before the revisionists <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/01/us/politics/hannity-limbaugh-trump-coronavirus.html\">try too hard</a> to make us forget, Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/28/trump-coronavirus-politics-us-health-disaster\">leadership</a> as the virus spread was as loud as a red cap perched on an orange combover. He abolished the pandemic group inside his own national security council, set aside the pandemic playbook left by his predecessor, and proposed <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-cut-cdcs-budget-democrats-claim-analysis/story?id=69233170\">cutting the CDC\u2019s funding</a> at the very moment the pandemic was taking hold. He spent February pretending like the pandemic was a <a href=\"https://factba.se/transcript/donald-trump-speech-kag-rally-north-charleston-south-carolina-february-28-2020\">hoax</a> or would <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/11/politics/fact-check-trump-administration-coronavirus-28-dishonest/index.html\">disappear</a>, and spent March telling governors to fend for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-respirators.html\">themselves</a>.</p> <p>So how did he respond to the worst weekly unemployment claims in American history? By changing the subject to the oil industry, suggesting that the Saudis and Russians might just be cutting production. As he bizarrely <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1245720677660925952\">tweeted</a> to a shell-shocked nation, \u201cIf it happens, will be GREAT for the oil &amp; gas industry.\u201d</p> <p>Only this sociopath of a president could imagine that what\u2019s good for the oil industry is good for the souls of 10 million newly unemployed Americans.</p> <p>Later in the day, at his so-called press briefing, he said he knew \u201cbetter than anybody\u201d what people were suffering in the restaurant business. His cure is to allow corporations to make their restaurant expenses deductible from their taxes. If only people were going to work and having boozy business lunches, this might just be an idea worth throwing in the trash can. Instead, it\u2019s yet another presidential brain fart.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve learned so much, <em>so much</em>, that we really have a chance to be bigger and better and stronger,\u201d he concluded, treating the epic disasters of the pandemic and recession as just one more lesson in his on-the-job training course.</p> <p>Sadly Trump\u2019s capacity to learn is far smaller than the economy\u2019s capacity to shed jobs. So we have stimulus cash designed to help people through the worst of the pandemic arriving not this month, or next, or the one after that. Some people won\u2019t receive the help until September, according to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/irs-to-begin-issuing-1200-coronavirus-payments-april-9-but-some-americans-wont-receive-checks-until-september-agency-plan-says/2020/04/02/8e0cfc84-751e-11ea-85cb-8670579b863d_story.html\">internal documents</a> from the Internal Revenue Service.</p> <p>How could we face such a botched preparation for a pandemic and such a botched response to a recession? Look no further than our botcher-in-chief, who decided to write to the Democratic leader in the Senate yesterday as if the only crisis that mattered was the one that threatened his ego.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s spat with Chuck Schumer began, appropriately enough, with the New York senator appearing on cable news. Demonstrating the full scope of his leadership skills, <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/02/politics/trump-schumer-letter-politics/index.html\">Trump wrote a letter</a> that ran the gamut of his emotions from infantile to childish.</p> <p>\u201cIf you spent less time on your ridiculous impeachment hoax, which went haplessly on forever and ended up going nowhere (except increasing my poll numbers),\u201d he wrote, \u201cand instead focused on helping the people of New York, then New York would not have been so completely unprepared for the \u2018invisible enemy.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>When it comes to haplessly going on forever, Trump may be something of an expert. It makes up for his lack of expertise in preparing for the invisible enemy that everyone but Trump could actually see coming.</p> <p>Now the man who could not prepare for one pandemic disaster is even less prepared for the economic disaster unfolding at the same time.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/03/coronavirus-economic-crisis-financial-impact\">How do countries differ in their response to the coronavirus economic crisis? | Ricardo Reis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Back in the late stages of the 2008 election, in the middle of the financial collapse, then-candidate Barack Obama was stunned to hear the economists\u2019 projections of 10% unemployment. \u201cWe\u2019ll have riots on the streets if that happens,\u201d one of his closest aides said in disbelief at the time. For his part, Obama joked darkly in private that maybe it would be better to lose the election after all.</p> <p>Unemployment peaked at 10% a full year later.

Those states just happen to be where the spike in unemployment claims is among the highest in the country.</p> <p>It won\u2019t be long before Biden\u2019s aides wonder what country they will face next January.

He\u2019s asked me to get involved in different projects. The vice-president and I speak, probably, sometimes five, 10 times a day, but everything that I\u2019m doing is at the direction of the vice-president.\u201d</p> \n<p>He glanced over at Pence, who smiled benignly.</p> \n<p>Earlier on Thursday, Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, announced a new House committee would oversee \u201call aspects\u201d of the federal response to the coronavirus pandemic and did not rule out an investigation in the style of the commission on the 9/11 terrorist attacks.</p> \n<p>Such a prospect clearly stung Trump, who compared it to the special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation and the congressional hearings into his dealings with Ukraine that led to his impeachment.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is not the time for politics,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cEndless partisan investigations \u2013 here we go again \u2013 have already done extraordinary damage to our country in recent years.

It\u2019s not any time for witch-hunts.\u201d</p> \n<p>Yet even as the president spoke, the White House was releasing a letter in which he assailed Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader from New York. \u201cThank you for your Democrat public relations letter and incorrect sound bites, which are wrong in every way,\u201d Trump wrote.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"037307b73ae975b2605dcdeec2ac0312fc73f673\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/037307b73ae975b2605dcdeec2ac0312fc73f673/0_0_5574_3716/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Shortages of equipment have roiled healthcare facilities in New York and across the US.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shortages of equipment have roiled healthcare facilities in New York and across the US.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vanessa Carvalho/REX/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cIf you spent less time on your ridiculous impeachment hoax, which went haplessly on forever and ended up going nowhere (except increasing my poll numbers) and instead focused on helping the people of New York, then New York would not have been so completely unprepared for the \u2018invisible enemy\u2019.\u201d</p> \n<p>Along with Kushner, Trump introduced Peter Navarro, the national Defense Production Act (DPA) policy coordinator. Navarro claimed there was a \u201cblack market springing up\u201d to drive up prices of protective gear, involving brokers and middle men.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are going to crack down on the hoarders,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Navarro, a hardliner on trade, also used the opportunity claim the pandemic showed \u201cwe\u2019re over-dependent on a global supply chain\u201d and was a \u201cvindication\u201d of Trump\u2019s stance on buying American goods and strengthening borders. More than once he praised \u201cTrump time\u201d \u2013 shorthand for getting things done fast.</p> \n<p>Trump said he was again invoking the DPA to ensure parts were available for the mass production of ventilators. Adm John Polowczyk, in charge of the supply chain, said the federal government had now produced 22.4m pairs of protective gloves, 5.2m face shields and 7,600 ventilators.</p> \n<p>But distributing the supplies to the places most in need has been a problem.
