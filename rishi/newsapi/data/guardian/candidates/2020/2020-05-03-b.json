Why do you believe Biden, and not Kavanaugh? Are they not both entitled to the same presumption of innocence, regardless of their political views? </p> \n  <p>Whitmer: \u201cYou know, Jake, as a survivor and as a feminist, I will say this. We need to give people an opportunity to tell their story. But then we have a duty to vet it. And <strong>just because you\u2019re a survivor doesn\u2019t mean that every claim is equal</strong>. It means we give them the ability to make their case, and the other side as well, and then to make a judgment that is informed. </p> \n  <p>\u201cI have read a lot about this current allegation. I know Joe Biden, and I have watched his defense. And there\u2019s not a pattern that goes into this.

We owe it to every woman who has a story <strong>to listen to that story, and then to vet that story,</strong> ask the questions and be critical thinkers, and then make a judgment, based on all of those pieces. I have done that in this instance. </p> \n  <p>\u201cAnd I will tell you this. I don\u2019t believe that it\u2019s consistent with the Joe Biden that I know.

But at the same time we pulled that back, I said ... I highly recommend [wearing masks] ... Unless you have a physical reason you can\u2019t wear the mask, and we understand that, but when you go into a retail store, that is the kind thing to do because I worry and we should all worry about the folks who are stocking shelves in grocery stores, the people who are [on] the check-out line who work there all day, and we got to try to protect them.\u201d</p> \n  <p>DeWine also <strong>stopped short of saying he would issue another stay-at-home order if cases started to rise</strong> after the reopening. </p> \n  <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to watch numbers every single day,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re going to communicate those numbers to the people of Ohio.

I don\u2019t think anything\u2019s been decided yet.\u201d</p> <p>Sanctuary cities, mostly run by Democratic authorities, do not comply with federal attempts to detain and deport undocumented migrants under Trump\u2019s hardline immigration approach.</p> <p>Speaking at the White House this week, the president said: \u201cIf you\u2019re going to get aid to the cities and states for the kind of numbers you\u2019re talking about \u2013 billions of dollars \u2013 I don\u2019t think you should have sanctuary cities.\u201d</p> <p>It is not clear that the White House <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/30/politics/trump-sanctuary-city-coronavirus/index.html\">would be legally able</a> to mandate such compliance. Observers have also questioned the propriety of tying economic aid to states and cities to policy priorities, particularly in a time of national crisis.</p> <p>The US has recorded more than 1.1m coronavirus cases and the death toll has passed 66,000. More than 30 million people have filed for unemployment in the past six weeks.</p> <p>Lawmakers are discussing a fourth coronavirus relief bill. Democrats are calling for aid to cities and states and some governors have warned of massive layoffs.</p> <p>New Jersey governor Phil Murphy told Fox News Sunday federal help would be \u201cabout firefighters, police, EMS, teachers at the point of attack\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re already seeing some layoffs in New Jersey,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need a big slug of federal, direct cash assistance.\u201d</p> <p>Illinois governor JB Pritzker, another Democrat, rejected Trump\u2019s argument that states with budget problems before the coronavirus outbreak should not be bailed out.</p> <p>All 50 states are suffering from the lack of revenue, Pritzker told CBS\u2019s Face the Nation, and \u201ccoronavirus has caused that. All of us are having to spend more on social services and healthcare to take care of people.\u201d</p> <p>Some Trump advisers have said the need for another stimulus bill is not yet clear. Kudlow said \u201cthere may well be additional legislation\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe know the economy is still in a terrible, contractionary phase, tremendous hardships everywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to work through this. I don\u2019t want to rule in or out anything right now. We are in discussions internally and with leading members of Congress.\u201d</p> <p>The White House, Kudlow said, was \u201cjust trying to stabilise things and get folks through this, and then we\u2019ll see, we will see in a couple of weeks, what needs to be done and perhaps how to do it\u201d.</p> <p>Kudlow was asked if aid to small businesses would be increased again, given how quickly the money is being claimed.</p> <p>\u201cIt may be,\u201d he said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t made a decision yet. This has been an extremely popular and effective programme. Keeping folks on the payroll is extremely important.\u201d</p> <p>While Democrats support more money for state, local and tribal governments, Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader of the Senate, has demanded protection for businesses from Covid-19-related lawsuits.</p> <p>Also on CNN, Maryland governor Larry Hogan, a Republican, chastised the White House, the Senate and the Democratic-held House for tying \u201cdivisive politics\u201d to the need for coronavirus relief.</p> <p>\u201cStop and focus on helping,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Trump is focused on the stalled US economy, seeing its recovery as vital in a re-election year as polls put him behind Joe Biden, his presumptive challenger, in key states.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/03/science-donald-trump-coronavirus\">Pandemic brings Trump's war on science to the boil \u2013 but who will win?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kudlow said: \u201cWe had a very strong economy during the Trump years and even during the first few months of this year. We\u2019d like to apply the same free enterprise principles. Besides [a] second-half rebound [this year], I think 2021 could be a spectacular year in the economy with the right set of policies.\u201d</p> <p>The president has backed protesters demanding an end to social restrictions, even when those protesters were armed and entered a statehouse, as in Michigan this week. That state has seen more than 43,000 cases and more than 4,000 deaths from Covid-19.</p> <p>More than half the 50 US states are now relaxing their social distancing guidelines, even as public health experts caution against moving too fast.</p> <p>On Sunday, senior Michigan adviser Dr Joneigh Khaldun told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press: \u201cIf we don\u2019t do well with these social distancing measures, more people will die and that is just the facts.\u201d</p>",

There are too many calculations involved. So, the most important thing is that we have a ballot. If you want to vote for someone, you vote for that person.\u201d</p> <p>Many observers suggest third-party candidates can change presidential elections.</p> <p>In 1992, for example, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/09/ross-perot-obituary\">Ross Perot ran as an independent </a>and won 19% of the vote as a Democratic challenger, Bill Clinton, beat incumbent Republican George HW Bush.</p> <p>Green candidate Ralph Nader\u2019s run eight years later is perhaps the most famous third-party campaign, given that George W Bush beat Al Gore in a desperately tight race.</p> <p>Nader told the Guardian this week \u201cthere are all kinds of other reasons that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats\">Democrats</a> lost\u201d in 2000, not least that Bush \u201cwas selected by five out of nine supreme court justices in a judicial coup d\u2019etat\u201d.</p> <p>But the political strategist Bob Shrum countered that Nader \u201churt because he attacked Gore from the left: that was his argument.\u201d</p> <p>Shrum added: \u201cI don\u2019t know that Amash is in the same position. The assumption that he would take votes from Biden rather than Trump seems dubious to me at best.\u201d</p> <p>Amash is <a href=\"https://www.clubforgrowth.org/scorecards/app/?party=all&amp;chamber=H&amp;yr=2018&amp;state=all&amp;rep\">a stringent conservative</a>, unlikely to appeal to many supporters of a centrist Democrat pushed left on policy by the challenge of Bernie Sanders and committed to naming a woman, quite possibly an African American, as his proposed vice-president.</p> <p>In 2016, the Libertarian Gary Johnson took nearly 4.5m votes nationally. Trump however lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton by nearly 3m ballots.</p> <p>The White House was won, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/11/donald-trump-rick-wilson-running-against-the-devil\">as it always is</a>, in the electoral college.</p> <p>In that fight Amash\u2019s home state, Michigan, was a key win for Trump over Clinton by just 10,704 votes, less than 0.25%, while Johnson <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/michigan\">won the support of 172,136 Michiganders \u2013 or 3.6%</a> of turnout.

  "<p>Since the sudden easing of a three-week lockdown in Ghana\u2019s two major cities, Accra and Kumasi, daily life is gradually returning to normal.</p> <p>Markets and commercial districts that had ground to an eerie halt have buzzed back to life. Stores and banks have slowly reopened. Modest traffic jams have emerged as many people who had escaped the lockdown return to the cities. But schools, places of worship, restaurants and bars remain shut.</p> <p>The reaction to President Nana Akufo-Addo\u2019s unexpected order to <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-19/ghana-president-lifts-lockdown-on-improved-virus-preparedness\">ease restrictions</a> two weeks ago has been mixed.</p> <p>Among the west African country\u2019s corporate workers and affluent classes, many people continue to work from home and fear that the easing of the lockdown is premature.</p> <p>From his apartment in Accra\u2019s affluent East Legon, 30-year-old Delvin Cooper, who works for digital creation firm Pulse Ghana, worries that the severity of the coronavirus outbreak has not fully registered in the country.</p> <p>\u201cThe government should have waited at least a little bit longer,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople still haven\u2019t got the actual understanding of what the situation is.\u201d</p> <p>However, for millions of people living on the edge, working in Ghana\u2019s largely informal economy, each day of the lockdown deepened their worries.</p> <p>Outside a small factory in a quiet neighbourhood in northern Accra, Raphael Awitor, who is in his 40s, stirs sand and cement with a shovel. Toiling in the blazing sun, he races to make as many bricks as possible. On good days he can earn 80 cedis (\u00a311).</p> <p>\u201cI planned to come to work on Monday whether or not the lockdown was lifted,\u201d Raphael said. \u201cWe were really hungry.\u201d</p> <p>He had become desperate after quickly spending his savings of just 300 cedis.</p> <p>Ghana\u2019s government has halved electricity costs and cancelled water bills for three months, and distributed food supplies to ease the effects of the lockdown. But the help has not reached everyone, Raphael laments. \u201cI didn\u2019t even see the trucks that were sharing it.\u201d</p> <p>Nearby, Nyamekye Agyemang, 55, sets her steel pots containing wraps of fufu, banku and a mix of stews on small stools in a wooden kiosk, waiting for custom from construction workers and passers-by. Food vendors were permitted to work during the lockdown but the impact on her income from reduced footfall was immense.</p> <p>\u201cIf the lockdown had continued, it would have been a disaster,\u201d she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c722eab1e0c9b2359cdac0c6bd9dbff4ee017a58\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c722eab1e0c9b2359cdac0c6bd9dbff4ee017a58/0_0_2738_1883/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People wait to receive food and water from volunteers in Accra during the partial lockdown on 4 April.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"688\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People wait to receive food and water from volunteers in Accra during the partial lockdown on 4 April.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Francis Kokoroko/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since the lockdown was eased, however, confirmed Covid-19 cases have doubled to more than 2,000. The number of deaths stands at 17. </p> <p>The government has defended its decision, arguing that the country\u2019s early lockdown allowed it to assess Ghana\u2019s needs, and that it bought the authorities time to boost health infrastructure, testing capacity, and pinpoint where the outbreaks were.</p> <p>In his speech announcing an easing of the lockdown, the president promised to improve testing. \u201cWe are ranked number one in Africa in the administering of tests per million people,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The government said it was starting the largest investment in the country\u2019s healthcare, with 96 new hospitals planned for the next year and improved services.</p> <p>Ghana\u2019s information minister, Kojo Nkrumah, told the Guardian the lockdown had helped the government to assess its health systems and what the country would need, based on increased data collection from Covid-19 tests.</p> <p>\u201cWe decided not to wait but to do a precautionary lockdown early and within that period get mass findings and data to help us,\u201d he said. About 110,000 tests were administered.</p> <p>The government has increased its supply of ventilators, said Nkrumah, to around 200. Among the first 1,200 patients fewer than five required intensive care or ventilation.</p> <p>According to Nkrumah, the length and function of lockdowns had to be decided by individual countries. \u201cWe should guard against assuming that there is a one size fits all approach. You should let the local context be applied when enforcing these lockdowns,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But pressure to ease the restrictions was mounting before the president made the decision. Ghana\u2019s powerful Trade Union Congress had pressed Addo to adopt a different strategy.</p> <p>\u201cNearly 90% of Ghanaians work in the informal economy,\u201d the secretary general, Anthony Baah, told the Guardian. \u201cIn a lockdown the impact can become unbearable, so we are happy with what the government has done.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fb5d64577ed266edfb1acdfc25bf48c19fa558b2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb5d64577ed266edfb1acdfc25bf48c19fa558b2/0_0_4000_2857/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman sells hand sanitiser at the Makola market, Accra.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"714\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman sells hand sanitiser at the Makola market, Accra.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nipah Dennis/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And just days after the lockdown was imposed at the end of March, pockets of demonstrations broke out in Ghana.</p> <p>Traders protesting in a market in Kasoa, western Accra, said they knew the lockdown was needed to curb the spread of the virus but they were not in a position to survive it. \u201cThe president\u2019s directive is good but it won\u2019t help us,\u201d said one.</p> <p>The mass outcry so early on during the lockdown was a worry for the government, particularly in what is supposed to be an election year.</p> <p>Many fear the government has been too hasty. Seizing the moment, former president John Mahama sparked the sparked the criticism in a tweet before Addo\u2019s announcement. \u201cConcerns persist that the government has taken a gamble,\u201d he said. \u201cMany health experts continue to suggest the necessity and appropriateness of an extension of the restrictions.\u201d</p>",

In 1992, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jul/09/ross-perot-obituary\">Ross Perot,</a> an eccentric Texan billionaire, took 19% of the vote, arguably denying George HW Bush a second term and putting Bill Clinton in the Oval Office. Perot ran again in 1996 but only garnered 8%.</p> <p>In 2000, Nader\u2019s Green Party bid took less than 3% of the vote but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/nov/10/uselections2000.usa8\">was widely blamed</a> for having cost Democrat Al Gore vital support and contributed to George W Bush\u2019s narrow win, a fork in the road that had dizzying implications for the Iraq war, climate crisis and the entire shape of the 21st century.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/BobShrum?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Bob Shrum,</a> a senior adviser for the Gore campaign, said this week: \u201cI haven\u2019t forgiven him. I think whatever good he did in the early part of his life is more than made up, for example, by the Iraq war. He hurt because he attacked Gore from the left: that was his argument. I don\u2019t know that Amash is in the same position. The assumption that he would take votes from Biden rather than Trump seems dubious to me at best.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e889c978b17f707360e25d115c37c2cd5c36c04f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e889c978b17f707360e25d115c37c2cd5c36c04f/0_182_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ralph Nader speaks at Boston University in November 2000.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ralph Nader speaks at Boston University in November 2000.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amy E Conn/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now 86, Nader is a consumer advocate who still follows politics closely, firing off <a href=\"https://nader.org/2020/04/27/the-uplifting-magic-of-mothers-day-in-these-perilous-days/\">columns and newsletters</a>. He denies that his candidacy handed the presidency to Bush.</p> <p>\u201cThere are all kinds of other reasons that the Democrats lost,\u201d he said. \u201cGore doesn\u2019t blame the Green Party at all. He said: \u2018It\u2019s us. We did it. I lost my home state of Tennessee. We bungled it in Florida.\u2019 On and on.</p> <p>\u201cAnd then George Bush wasn\u2019t elected, he was selected by five out of nine supreme court justices in a judicial coup d\u2019etat [following a dispute over the count in Florida]. The only way the Democratic party can explain its constant loss to the worst Republican party in history is to scapegoat the Greens. It\u2019s built into their DNA.\u201d</p> <p>Nader ran in 2004 and 2008 but polled less than 1% both times. Campaigning could be a frustrating experience, he recalls.</p> <p>\u201cAlmost all the interviews had nothing to do with <a href=\"http://www.votenader.org/\">my agenda, which was a precursor</a> to Bernie Sanders\u2019 agenda \u2013 universal healthcare, free tuition, living wage, cracking down on corporate crime. All they wanted to ask about was \u2018spoiler\u2019 and that\u2019s partly because the Democratic party is much more scapegoating toward the small left parties than the Republican party is to the Libertarian party.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know whether that will happen this year, but by far the Democrats are much more aggressive to get third-party candidates like the Green Party off the ballot, harassing them, calling them spoilers and setting the media\u2019s agenda for spoilers.</p> <p>\u201cEven the European media would call me up and say: \u2018Do you think you\u2019re helping George W Bush? Are you a spoiler?\u2019 And I\u2019d say: \u2018Spoiler? I\u2019m trying to fight a spoiled political system.\u2019 A multi-party system creates more meaning for voters because it gives them more voices and choices.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018We need more parties\u2019</h2> <p>Nader welcomes the entry of Amash and others as an expression of first amendment freedoms but is uncertain about the likely political consequences.</p> <p>\u201cIf he plays his cards right and he basically is viewed as the lawmaker who stood up to the foul mouth, snarling, lying, bungling betrayer of his own voters, then he will take more from Trump,\u201d he said of Amash. \u201cBut if he tries to appeal to all voters, then it\u2019s another equation and nobody knows what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d</p> <p>Johnson, a former governor of New Mexico, came third in 2012 and did so again in 2016. But it was the Green candidate, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jill-stein\">Stein</a>, who was accused of robbing Clinton of the presidency after gaining more votes in Michigan and Wisconsin than Trump\u2019s margin of victory in both states.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"924700c3cdcb2732c06503699a14593711750021\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/924700c3cdcb2732c06503699a14593711750021/381_289_3902_2341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Evan McMullin campaigns in Draper, Utah in October 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Evan McMullin campaigns in Draper, Utah, in October 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rick Bowmer/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Utah in 2016, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EvanMcMullin?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Evan McMullin</a>, a former CIA operations officer, finished third in his home state with 21% of the vote.</p> <p>Now executive director of the pro-democracy group <a href=\"https://standuprepublic.com/\">Stand Up Republic, </a>he said: \u201cYou take criticism from both sides when you run as a third-party candidate or as an independent.

We need more competition and more ideas.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018A huge mistake\u2019</h2> <p>Amash could prove attractive to small-government Republicans who already lean libertarian. But the former Illinois congressman <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WalshFreedom?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Joe Walsh</a>, who challenged Trump in this year\u2019s Republican primary, argues that this is not the time.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s a huge mistake, it\u2019s the wrong thing to do,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will help get Trump elected. Amash and I are friends, we\u2019re colleagues, but he\u2019s clearly putting what\u2019s best for Justin Amash ahead of what\u2019s best for the country. If he does it, it\u2019s a selfish thing for him to do.

  "<p>Donald Trump is getting nervous. Internal polls show him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/26/donald-trump-xenophobia-re-election-campaign-2020\">losing in November</a> unless the economy comes roaring back.</p> \n<p>But much of the economy remains closed because of the pandemic. The number of infections and deaths continue to climb.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/02/us-healthcare-system-coronavirus-pandemic-bernie-sanders-pramila-jayapal\">The pandemic has made the US healthcare crisis far more dire. We must fix the system | Bernie Sanders and Pramila Jayapal</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>So what is Trump\u2019s re-election strategy? Reopen the economy anyway, despite the risks.</p> \n<h2>Step 1</h2> \n<p><strong>Remove income support, so people have no choice but to return to work.</strong></p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s labor department has decided that furloughed employees \u201cmust accept\u201d an employer\u2019s offer to return to work and therefore forfeit unemployment benefits, regardless of Covid-19.</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s ally, Iowa\u2019s Republican governor, Kim Reynolds, says employees cannot refuse to return to work for fear of contracting the disease. \u201cThat\u2019s a voluntary quit,\u201d making someone ineligible for benefits.</p> \n<p>GOP officials in Oklahoma are even threatening to withhold the $600 a week of extra unemployment benefits Congress has provided workers, if an employer wants to hire them. Safety is irrelevant.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf the employer will contact us \u2026 we will cut off their benefits,\u201d says Teresa Thomas Keller of the Oklahoma Employment Security Commission.</p> \n<p>Forcing people to choose between getting Covid-19 or losing their livelihood is inhumane. It is also nonsensical. Public health still depends on as many workers as possible staying home. That\u2019s a big reason why Congress provided the extra benefits.</p> \n<h2>Step 2</h2> \n<p><strong>Hide the facts.</strong></p> \n<p>No one knows how many Americans are infected because the Trump administration continues to drag its heels on testing. To date only 6.5m tests have been completed in a population of more than 200 million adults.</p> \n<p>Florida, one of the first states to reopen, has <a href=\"https://www.tampabay.com/news/health/2020/04/29/florida-medical-examiners-were-releasing-coronavirus-death-data-the-state-made-them-stop/\">stopped</a> releasing medical examiners\u2019 statistics on the number of Covid-19 victims because the figures are higher than the state\u2019s official count.</p> \n<p>But it\u2019s impossible to fight the virus without adequate data. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/02/white-house-blocks-fauci-congress-trump-senate\">Dr Anthony Fauci</a>, the administration\u2019s leading infectious disease expert, warns that reopening poses \u201ca really significant risk\u201d without more testing.</p> \n<p>Not surprisingly, the White House has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/02/white-house-blocks-fauci-congress-trump-senate\">blocked Fauci from testifying</a> before the House.</p> \n<h2>Step 3</h2> \n<p><strong>Pretend it\u2019s about \u201cfreedom\u201d.</strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"517acb50-d7a2-4c3d-87b3-6c6adde69b2f\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zXXFf0Q2bcU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Weeks ago, Trump called on citizens to \u201cLIBERATE\u201d states like Michigan, whose Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer, imposed strict stay-at-home rules.</p> \n<p>Michigan has the third-highest number of Covid-19 deaths in America, although it is 10th in population. When on Thursday Whitmer extended the rules to 28 May, gun-toting protesters rushed the state house chanting: \u201cLock her up!\u201d</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/01/trump-michigan-protesters-gretchen-whitmer\">Rather than condemn their behavior</a>, Trump suggested Whitmer \u201cmake a deal\u201d with them.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe Governor of Michigan should give a little, and put out the fire,\u201d he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1256202305680158720\">tweeted</a>. \u201cThese are very good people, but they are angry. They want their lives back again, safely!\u201d</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, the attorney general, William Barr, has directed the justice department to take legal action against any state or local authorities imposing lockdown measures that \u201ccould be violating the constitutional rights and civil liberties of individual citizens\u201d.</p> \n<p>Making this about \u201cfreedom\u201d is absurd. Freedom is meaningless for people who have no choice but to accept a job that risks their health.</p> \n<h2>Step 4</h2> \n<p><strong>Shield businesses against lawsuits for spreading the infection.</strong></p> \n<p>Trump is pushing to give businesses that reopen a \u201cliability shield\u201d against legal action by workers or customers who get infected by the virus.</p> \n<p>This week, he announced he would use the Defense Production Act to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/28/trump-executive-order-meat-processing-plants-coronavirus\">force meat-processing plants to remain open</a>, despite high rates of Covid-19 infections and deaths among meatpackers.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to sign an executive order today, I believe, and that\u2019ll solve any liability problems,\u201d Trump said.</p> \n<p>The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, insists that proposed legislation giving state and local governments funding they desperately need must include legal immunity for corporations that cause workers or consumers to become infected.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have a red line on liability,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cIt won\u2019t pass the Senate without it.\u201d</p> \n<p>But how can the economy safely reopen if companies don\u2019t have an incentive to keep people safe? Promises to provide protective gear and other safeguards are worthless absent the threat of damages if workers or customers become infected.</p> \n<h2>The truth</h2> \n<p><strong>The biggest obstacle to reopening the economy is the pandemic itself.</strong></p> \n<p>Any rush to reopen without adequate testing and tracing \u2013 far more than now under way \u2013 will cause a resurgence of the disease and another and longer economic crisis.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/01/trump-stock-market-economy-unemployment\">Unemployment is ravaging America.

But Donald Trump couldn\u2019t care less. He was slow to respond to the threat, then he lied about it, then made it hard for states \u2013 especially those with Democratic governors \u2013 to get the equipment they need.</p> \n<p>Now he\u2019s trying to force the economy to reopen in order to boost his electoral chances this November, and he\u2019s selling out Americans\u2019 health to seal the deal.
