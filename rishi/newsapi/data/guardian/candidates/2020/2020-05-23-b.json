But a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/one-final-viral-infusion-trumps-move-to-block-travel-from-europe-triggered-chaos-and-a-surge-of-passengers-from-the-outbreaks-center/2020/05/23/64836a00-962b-11ea-82b4-c8db161ff6e5_story.html\">new Washington Post story</a> reveals how that decision and the muddled messaging surrounding it may well have sealed the country\u2019s coronavirus fate.</p> \n  <p>While Trump points to his travel ban of China as evidence of his proactive response, mounting evidence indicates the outbreak was \u201cdriven overwhelmingly\u201d by Europe:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The images [of airport chaos] showed how a policy intended to block the pathogen\u2019s entry into the United States instead delivered one final viral infusion. As those exposed travelers fanned out into U.S. cities and suburbs, they became part of an influx from Europe that went unchecked for weeks and helped to seal the country\u2019s coronavirus fate.</p> \n   <p>Epidemiologists contend the U.S. outbreak was driven overwhelmingly by viral strains from Europe rather than China. More than 1.8 million travelers entered the United States from Europe in February alone as that continent became the center of the pandemic. Infections reached critical mass in New York and other cities well before the White House took action, according to studies mapping the virus\u2019s spread. The crush of travelers triggered by Trump\u2019s announcement only added to that viral load.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And <em>about</em> that China ban, which has become the bulwark of Trump\u2019s defense of his administration\u2019s response:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>When Trump moved to block travel from China in January, there were few indications of disruption at affected airports. But while the president has depicted that decision as one he made before anyone else recognized it was necessary, in reality major airlines were forcing his hand.</p> \n   <p>Delta and American had announced on Jan. 31 they were suspending routes to China before Trump announced the restrictions. United informed the White House it had already decided to do the same but was willing to hold off on announcing it publicly if Trump was prepared to act swiftly in issuing an order, officials said.

Bryan Armen Graham will be here to take you through the day later, but for now, I\u2019m your guide. </p> \n  <p>According to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/may/15/coronavirus-map-us-latest-cases-state-by-state\">researchers at Johns Hopkins University in Maryland</a>, <strong>the US has now recorded 1,601,260 cases and 96,002 deaths</strong>. </p> \n  <p>Rates are slowing in some states hard-hit in the first part of the outbreak, New York notably among them, and increasing elsewhere. Nonetheless, most states are attempting some form of economic reopening \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/21/us-unemployment-figures-jobs-lost-coronavirus\">nearly 40m Americans have filed for unemployment under lockdown</a>, after all \u2013 and debate is raging over whether those states moving fastest are moving too fast for safety.</p> \n  <p>It\u2019s Memorial Day weekend, the traditional start of the American summer, and the title of this piece by Amanda Holpuch, Nina Lakhani and Khushbu Shah rather sums up the question: <strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/23/america-coronavirus-covid-19-second-wave\">America begins to unlock for summer \u2013 but is it inviting a disastrous second wave?</a></strong></p> \n  <p>Donald Trump doesn\u2019t think so, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/22/donald-trump-churches-mosques-synagogues-reopen\">on Friday at the White House</a> he invoked powers he doesn\u2019t have to say governors<strong> should reopen all places of worship</strong> and if they didn\u2019t, he would. Once again, he can\u2019t, or couldn\u2019t if it came to it, do that. <a href=\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/can-federal-government-override-state-government-rules-social-distancing-promote-economy\">Tenth amendment, etc</a>. As for the motivation behind Trump\u2019s curt announcement, there are reports that his <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/22/trump-churches-evaneglicals-coronavirus-274842\">support among evangelicals is slipping</a>.</p> \n  <p>That would be intensely worrying for Trump in <strong>a re-election year already marked by economic meltdown</strong>. On the upside for the president, on Friday a gaffe by his notoriously gaffe-prone opponent, Joe Biden (if he were a British football manager, he would\u2019ve earned the standard honorific \u201cthe Gaffer\u201d many years ago), showed how swiftly and ferociously the Trump campaign machine still runs.</p> \n  <p>Some say Biden needs only to stay in his Delaware basement to beat Trump. But on Friday, from his basement, the former vice-president told an African American radio host if you \u201c<strong>have a problem figuring out whether you\u2019re for me or Trump, then you ain\u2019t black</strong>\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/22/joe-biden-draws-criticism-americans-who-back-trump-aint-black\">Biden apologised as the Trump campaign pounced</a> \u2013 and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/22/black-americans-joe-biden-democratic-party-relationship\">liberals too</a>.</p> \n  <p>So there\u2019s that, and any resultant fallout, to consider along with all things coronavirus-related.</p> \n  <p>In the meantime, some further reading. Khushbuh Shah reports from Georgia, a Republican state turning slightly more Democratic, on how one\u2019s view of how soon to reopen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/23/georgia-coronavirus-us-reopening-covid-19-brian-kemp\">depends largely on the way one votes</a>: </p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/23/georgia-coronavirus-us-reopening-covid-19-brian-kemp\">\u2018It depends on your politics\u2019: Georgia\u2019s uneven reopening breaks along party lines</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div>",

  "<p>Former president Barack Obama has dipped his toes into the 2020 presidential campaign recently and is positioned to do more in the coming months as Joe Biden\u2019s effort to defeat Donald Trump gathers steam.</p> <p>Interviews with about a dozen Democratic strategists, officials and people close to Obama indicated members of the party want the popular former president to use his powerful online presence and focus on rallying key Democrat constituencies that are critical to a Biden victory.</p> <p>Obama is regarded as one of the most popular figures in American politics and a huge asset within the Democratic party. He left the White House with a <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/116479/barack-obama-presidential-job-approval.aspx\">near-60%</a> approval rating. His endorsement for any candidate is the political campaign equivalent of an oilman and hitting a gusher.</p> <p>Obama would be most effective, interviewees said, in highlighting his former vice-president\u2019s r\u00e9sum\u00e9, rallying key Democratic groups like African American women, and pushing voters to register.</p> <p>The situation is unique. There hasn\u2019t been a popular former two-term president eager to hit the trail for his former running mate for years. On top of that, the coronavirus pandemic limits in-person campaigning and rallies. Still, the strategists interviewed say Obama is valuable and should be used everywhere.</p> <p>\u201cYou rarely have a former president that is more popular than the now-sort-of-nominee,\u201d Democratic pollster Cornell Belcher said. \u201cBarack Obama is the most popular political figure in America right now.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1e89ef8ce941aff9d62032b0647df61543fcd572\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e89ef8ce941aff9d62032b0647df61543fcd572/0_166_2200_1321/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Biden and Barack Obama before a presidential primary debate in 2007.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Biden and Barack Obama before a presidential primary debate in 2007.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Young/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Valerie Jarrett, who served as a senior adviser to Obama during his time in the White House, said Obama is \u201ccommitted to helping Vice-President Biden in any way the Biden campaign thinks is helpful. The pandemic is forcing everyone to be more creative since the conventional ways of doing business, including campaigning, are not possible.\u201d</p> <p>Obama has a robust social media presence with millions of Twitter followers, and Jarrett pointed to Obama\u2019s endorsement of Biden, which took the form of an online video now that campaign rallies have become a thing of the pre-pandemic past.</p> <p>\u201cI think you can tell from the video that he rolled out with his endorsement, one very useful platform is President Obama\u2019s social media platform where he has more followers than any other politician by far.\u201d</p> <p>According to a Democratic strategist familiar with Obama\u2019s thinking, the former president is eager to campaign for Democrats \u201cup and down the ballot\u201d in 2020. He plans to follow the lead of the Biden campaign as well as that of the main Democratic campaign arms \u2013 the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and other umbrella organizations.</p> <p>Obama was an active surrogate to boost Democrats in the 2018 midterm elections but since then has taken a more restrained approach to the national spotlight. He has only waded into current politics a few times and mostly on an indirect basis.</p> <p>Most recently, though, he delivered a commencement speech for college graduates where he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/16/barack-obama-coronavirus-donald-trump-criticism-speech-covid-19\">said</a> the coronavirus pandemic had \u201cfinally torn back the curtain on the idea that so many of the folks in charge know what they\u2019re doing\u201d. Obama didn\u2019t mention Trump by name but the speech was widely regarded as a direct allusion to the president. It could also herald what Obama\u2019s public appearances in the final months of the 2020 presidential campaign would be like.</p> <p>Separately, during a closed event with thousands of supporters and Obama alumni, the former president <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/09/us/politics/obama-flynn-coronavirus-trump.html\">warned</a> that the justice department\u2019s decision to drop charges against the former Trump administration national security adviser Michael Flynn put the rule of law at risk.</p> <p>Campaign veterans and strategists say Obama is useful less as an attack dog going head to head with Trump and more as someone who highlights a positive vision of why voters should elect Biden.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"65f2635a13f2d6e816e814bead1ccc1686037e92\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/65f2635a13f2d6e816e814bead1ccc1686037e92/0_19_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"President Obama endorses Joe Biden via online video link.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">President Obama endorses Joe Biden via online video link.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Cahn/Zuma Wire/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cTo me, Obama is the world\u2019s best character witness,\u201d said Teddy Goff, who was digital director for Obama\u2019s second presidential campaign. \u201cYeah, he can make the case that Trump is bad. He can certainly validate the case for Biden\u2019s policies. But essentially he\u2019s the most popular political figure on planet Earth and the one guy he entrusted with the single most important appointment of his life was Joe Biden.\u201d</p> <p>But Obama could also persuade more people to vote.</p> <p>Meg Ansara, who was national regional director for Obama\u2019s first presidential campaign and more recently battleground states director for Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential campaign, said one of the key priorities, especially in this environment, is voter registration.</p> <p>\u201cI think voter registration is a huge place,\u201d Ansara said, adding that persuading undecided voters is important for someone like Obama as well. \u201cI\u2019m a big believer that you need to do both in the bulk of these battleground states.\u201d</p> <p>There have been moments during the last three years when Democrats had wondered why Obama didn\u2019t speak out more against Trump or weigh in more during the Democratic primary. That\u2019s actually an asset now and adds weight to when Obama does speak out, said Guy Cecil, who runs the Priorities USA Super Pac.</p> <p>\u201cI think in some respects the Biden campaign benefits from the fact that Obama has not spent three and a half years in the political limelight, attacking the president, attacking the administration, engaging in a back-and-forth with [Trump],\u201d Cecil said. </p> <p>Corey Platt, a veteran Democratic strategist and campaign manager, said that Obama and Biden have done a good job of appearing together so far and he should keep doing that rather than just focusing on going head-to-head with Trump.</p> <p>\u201cI think he if continues to remind people about competency and progress under his administration it will make people feel good about Biden, change and sanity. If he engages Trump I think that could backfire,\u201d Platt said. \u201cHe can help articulate Biden\u2019s vision for what happens next year and promote confidence in getting through this crisis together.\u201d</p>",

The result is that some Georgia residents venture out and businesses tentatively open, while many others remain closed. The pattern of reopening seems to mirror the political divides of the state.</p> <p>Many businesses in <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/atlanta-neighborhood-2016-presidential-election-results-map/\">predominantly</a> liberal-leaning communities, similar to the one where Ponce City Market is based, have resisted the easing of restrictions.

Atlantans are seeing a rift: uneven re-openings across the city, at times based on the faultlines of their communities as Georgians wait to see if their lives can return to normal.</p> <p>\u201cI live in suburbia in north Atlanta, and the attitude up there about this whole thing is completely different,\u201d says Brian Maloof, the owner of Atlanta restaurant Manuel\u2019s Tavern, as he watches a regular eat a hamburger under an outdoor tent near his restaurant on CCTV.</p> <p>\u201cIt is completely dependent upon your political philosophy, on whether or not you\u2019re going to open and throw the doors open and everything is fine, or if you\u2019re going to be more cautious about it.\u201d</p> <p>But the economy is flickering back to life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f86c8b1d467cef2b54cbfcd283fa8b4dbed5ffeb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f86c8b1d467cef2b54cbfcd283fa8b4dbed5ffeb/5_706_3040_1824/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tourists shop at the River Street shops in Savannah.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tourists shop at the River Street shops in Savannah.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sebastien Duval/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Around Mother\u2019s Day, as restaurants welcomed people to celebrate, Holeman and Finch, one of Georgia\u2019s largest bakeries, saw an increase in sales, reaching a pandemic high of 10% of normal business.</p> <p>The wholesale bakery\u2019s goods, found in approximately 300 restaurants statewide, are delivered to only half of its partners nearly a month after the governor lifted the state\u2019s short lived shelter-in-place, and at a small fraction of its usual profit, says the company\u2019s director of business operations Brittany Brown.</p> <p>But the damage is done, and the road back looks hard as fears of the virus \u2013 or its return \u2013 remain. The company has let go more than 80 employees in the past two months, and recently asked 14 to return to work. Only four showed up, Brown says, many of them unable to make it back to work because public transportation has not returned to full capacity. One employee told her he would have to walk eight miles each day, in between various legs of public transport, to get to work right now. He wouldn\u2019t be able to return to work, he told her.</p> <p>But even as employees have the go-ahead to return to work, it doesn\u2019t mean they or their employers are open for business. The Georgia department of labor <a href=\"https://dol.georgia.gov/press-releases/2020-05-21/georgia-reports-highest-unemployment-rate-record\">announced Thursday</a> that more than 2m regular initial unemployment claims have been processed in the past 10 weeks \u2013 more than the 1.7m claims filed over the last five years combined.</p> <p>More than <a href=\"https://dph.georgia.gov/covid-19-daily-status-report\">40,000 Georgians</a> have tested positive for coronavirus since 1 February, with no downward trend of cases that the governor projected while announcing his plans to revive the economy at the end of April. Instead, a misleading chart was posted on the public health department\u2019s website showing a steady decline in cases over two weeks, with the dates out of order, <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/confused-and-scared-georgians-frustrated-over-shifting-virus-data/k9oUbZDE3z6iyouWQBF7gJ/\">according</a> to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.</p> <p>\u201cI have said from the very beginning that we are making decisions based on data, science and the advice of public health officials like Dr Toomey,\u201d Kemp said at a news conference Thursday, referring to the head of the public health department. \u201cWe are also committed to full transparency and honesty as we weather this healthcare crisis.\u201d</p> <p>The chart has since been taken down. Georgia\u2019s Republican governor was one of the last to declare a shelter-in-place and the first to lift the order. According to the state\u2019s own data, the numbers are ping-ponging on the chart, similar to a plateau, rather than a decline, three weeks after restrictions eased.</p> <p>As the numbers fluctuate, by the state\u2019s own additions and miscalculations, Georgians watch those numbers weary and impatient to return to their daily rituals.</p> <p>Recently, Maloof, the owner of Manuel\u2019s Tavern, received a call from a group who had been meeting at his restaurant for nearly three decades. They wanted to meet inside, they begged him, asking him to make an exception for them as he served dozens of others takeout only. He relented by cordoning off space for his loyal customers, making space for the group.</p> <p>On the day he opened for them, he counted the people in a corner of his restaurant, the ones who came through the door.</p> <p>\u201cOnly eight were willing to come inside,\u201d Maloof says. \u201cIt was very telling to me how much fear there is, and how much concern is still out there.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>A year ago, Soyoung Lee was one of a crowd of climate activists demonstrating on the streets of Seoul in a campaign inspired by the global school strike founder Greta Thunberg.</p> <p>Today, the 35-year-old lawyer is the youngest member of the South Korean parliament and a driving force in the government\u2019s green new deal, which aims to create millions of jobs in renewable energy and help the economy recover from the coronavirus lockdown.</p> <p>Lee\u2019s transformation highlights how much progress the global wave of youth climate activism has made in a remarkably short space of time. It also raises hopes that South Korea \u2013 a country long considered one of the world\u2019s worst <a href=\"https://climateanalytics.org/latest/south-korea-leads-list-of-2016-climate-villains/\">climate villains</a> \u2013 will set a global example by accelerating the shift away from fossil fuels.</p> <p>Lee was invited to stand as a candidate for the president Moon Jae-in\u2019s Democracy party in last month\u2019s legislative elections. She proposed a green new deal in the campaign manifesto as a way to appeal to young voters.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"684567da67d4f0346ce50101ba428b940606f3de\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/684567da67d4f0346ce50101ba428b940606f3de/0_0_1089_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Soyoung Lee\" width=\"1000\" height=\"661\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Soyoung Lee</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Office of Lee Soyoung</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI was the first to suggest that,\u201d she said. \u201cI want to decarbonise Korean society. This is my personal mission. That is why I went into politics.\u201d</p> <p>Winning her seat in a landslide, she is now part of a ruling coalition with a huge majority to push through any measures it chooses.</p> <p>The government\u2019s priority is to boost the economy after the Covid-19 crisis. South Korea has won praise around the world for its handling of the health pandemic, but its powerful industrial conglomerates have taken a big hit from the downturn in global trade.</p> <p>Many business leaders and veteran ministers want recovery to focus purely on digital technology. But civil society and lawmakers like Lee have persuaded the president that it is possible to create jobs and raise climate ambitions.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s clear the green new deal is the way for us to go,\u201d Moon <a href=\"https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2020/05/113_289851.html\">announced this week</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s necessary to lay out a grand plan for the green new deal to harmonise with the establishment of digital infrastructure.\u201d</p> <p>For the president, the priority is job creation and demonstrating to the world that South Korea is a responsible member of the international community.</p> <p>Recent history gives cause for scepticism. This high-tech nation has a low-grade energy supply. After the 2008-09 financial crisis, the government promised a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/apr/21/south-korea-enviroment-carbon-emissions\">\u201cgreen growth\u201d strategy,</a> but the plans for more river protection and bike lanes were an excuse for construction companies to pour more concrete than ever.</p> <p>In the years since, coal use and carbon emissions have surged. The country is calculated to have $106bn of fossil fuel assets incompatible with the Paris climate agreement \u2013 more than any other nation. In 2016, activists described South Korea as the world\u2019s <a href=\"https://climateanalytics.org/latest/south-korea-leads-list-of-2016-climate-villains/\">biggest carbon villain</a>.</p> <p>Analysts say this time is different because the president has already set a goal of raising the share of electricity coming from renewables from 3% to 20% by the end of the decade. That will require an investment of about 100tn Korean won (\u00a366bn).</p> <p>Byunghwa Han, a senior analyst at Eugene Investment and Securities and a longtime advocate of renewables, said the political stars were now finally aligned.</p> <p>\u201cI am very optimistic. This is the best opportunity in Korea since I have been involved in this field since 2008,\u201d he said. \u201cThe government is very ambitious about the green new deal and, with a strong majority in the national assembly, the president can enact policies with no roadblocks.\u201d</p> <p>Lee vowed to prevent a repeat of the last greenwashing project. \u201cToday is totally different. In our green new deal, the starting point is the reduction of emissions,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to legislate measures for a 2050 net zero goal, phase out coal earlier and enhance our ambitions for renewable energy.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"11a088fbca1c665add810011991fba0fca7887d9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11a088fbca1c665add810011991fba0fca7887d9/0_85_1280_768/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Soyoung Lee announcing the Green New Deal manifesto at the press conference during the general election\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Soyoung Lee announcing the Green New Deal manifesto at the press conference during the general election.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Office of Lee Soyoung</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The central test of the government\u2019s convictions will be cuts to domestic coal consumption and overseas financing of coal projects. South Korea plans to generate 30% of its electricity from this dirtiest of fossil fuels by 2030. Lee says this would make it impossible to reach the net zero goal by 2050.</p> <p>South Korea could make a still greater contribution to global climate efforts if it halted support for coal plants in south-east Asia. It is one of only three nations \u2013 along with China and Japan \u2013 that still provide loans for such projects, which are blackballed by most nations and a growing number of international financial institutions.</p> <p>\u201cIf we stop this funding, it will show the transition in our country and across the global community,\u201d Lee said. \u201cWe need to give up on sectors that make short-term profit.\u201d</p> <p>The companies that have the most to lose, including the power utility Kepco and the heavy engineering conglomerate Doosan, are already pushing back. Local media report heated disputes among ministers, who say coal is important for developing nations.</p> <p>Lee argues South Korea will have more stranded assets the longer it delays transition away from fossil fuels. \u201cIt makes economic sense to change. These kinds of businesses will not be viable in the future.\u201d</p> <p>In the coming weeks, the green new deal will dominate discussions of the new session of the national assembly, another sign of how far the climate has moved up the political agenda.</p> <p>Lee credits the school strike movement for raising awareness. She has campaigned for decarbonisation for many years and worked as a lawyer on climate litigation suits, but she says there was little public support until recently.</p> <p>\u201cI was a minority in civil society, but the global school strikes sparked a lot of activism in Korea,\u201d she said. \u201cGreta [Thunberg] inspired Korean youth. Last October we had a climate emergency demonstration with 5,000 people. That was the biggest so far. There was also a big one in May. I join them them all the time.\u201d</p> <p>Her journey from the streets and the courtroom to the corridors of power is a sign of how Generation Greta is coming of age. Lee says there is still a long way to go.</p> <p>She estimates that just 10 of the 300 legislators are seriously committed to climate issues. \u201cIt is definitely still not mainstream,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the green new deal is now at the centre of political discussion for the first time. We need to see whether this means a sudden revolutionary change or the start of something incremental.</p> <p>\u201cI am not going to be over optimistic about securing a tremendous budget with huge goals. But it is important that the government is setting targets and moving in the right direction.There is a lot of value in that. We will do our best to make South Korea a model in this, as it has been in its handling of Covid.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Efforts to highlight Donald Trump\u2019s largesse during his time in office have backfired after his press secretary appeared to display the US president\u2019s personal bank details to the world.</p> \n<p>At a press conference on Friday, Kayleigh McEnany announced that Trump would donate his quarterly pay cheque to the Department of Health and Human Services to \u201csupport the efforts being undertaken to confront, contain and combat the coronavirus\u201d.

People usually celebrate by travelling, visiting family and gathering for lavish meals, all of which will be largely prohibited as authorities try to prevent new virus outbreaks. The holiday will begin on Saturday or Sunday, depending on the sighting of the new moon, and the dawn-to-dusk fasting of Ramadan will come to an end.</p> \n  <p>Some countries, including Turkey, Iraq and Jordan, will impose round-the-clock curfews for the holiday. In Saudi Arabia, home to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, people will be allowed to leave their homes only to buy food and medicine. </p> \n  <p>Most restrictions have been lifted in Jerusalem, but the Al-Aqsa mosque compound \u2013 the third holiest site in Islam \u2013 will remain closed until. Shopkeepers in the Old City, empty of tourists and pilgrims since March, are reeling from the six weeks of lockdown. </p> \n  <p>In Egypt, authorities have extended the curfew, which will now begin at 5pm instead of 9pm, and halted public transportation until 29 May. Shopping centres, malls, beaches and parks will be closed.<br></p> \n  <p>In Indonesia, the largest Muslim-majority country, the president, Joko Widodo, said restrictions would remain in place through the holiday. The country, with a population of 270m, has reported more than 18,000 cases, including about 1,200 deaths. Since the start of the Ramadan, the government has imposed an outright ban on \u201cmudik\u201d, a holiday tradition in which millions of Indonesians living in big cities flock to their home towns to celebrate with relatives.

He writes:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Sweden has received considerable media scrutiny in recent days. According to figures published on Tuesday, it now has the highest <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/05/20/sweden-becomes-country-highest-coronavirus-death-rate-per-capita/\">coronavirus-per-capita death rate in the world</a>, with an average of 6.08 deaths per million inhabitants a day on a rolling seven-day average between 13 and 20 May. As of 22 May, Sweden has had 32,172 confirmed cases and 3,871 deaths. These figures are lower than those of Italy or the UK. But they are higher than those of Portugal and Greece, two countries with a similar size of population to Sweden. The <a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/\">figures</a> are also much higher than Sweden\u2019s Nordic neighbours, with Denmark at 11,182 cases and 561 deaths, Norway at 8,309 and 235, and Finland at 6,537 and 306 ...</p> \n   <p>But despite the high number of deaths, about 70% of Swedes <a href=\"https://www.msb.se/contentassets/01163f676a3348cfa68491c617b5e1d0/1544449-msb_resultat-coronaundersoknng_200510.pdf\">support</a> their government\u2019s approach. In fact, there has not been much public debate or organised opposition to the strategy. The deaths have indeed shocked many Swedes, especially the disproportionately high number of deaths among those over 70 in care homes and those from working-class, immigrant backgrounds. The debates, however, seem to be taking a more socioeconomic angle. In other words, the reasons for these deaths are being blamed on structural, economic, and social deficiencies \u2013 but not on the strategy itself.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/22/sweden-u-turn-controversial-covid-19-strategy\">Why Sweden is unlikely to make a U-turn on its controversial Covid-19 strategy | Tae Hoon Kim</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-22T18:07:44.933Z\">at 7.07pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec7ea0e8f0886ce4f5d8a05\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-22T15:21:38.106Z\">4.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Africa reaches 100,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>More than 100,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus have now been reported across Africa, according to figures collated by the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC).</p> \n  <p>According to the <a href=\"https://africacdc.org/covid-19/\">interactive coronavirus dashboard</a> hosted on the African Union health agency\u2019s website, there have so far been 3,101 deaths across the continent from Covid-19, while 39,416 people have recovered. </p> \n  <p>Unlike other regions, particularly Europe to the north, the coronavirus has been slow to spread across Africa.

Here\u2019s is what\u2019s foremost today so far:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>America\u2019s top public health expert <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/19/trump-fauci-relationship-coronavirus-us\">Anthony Fauci</a>, the head of the White House coronavirus task force, urges caution as millions head out of doors for the Memorial Day weekend</strong>, the first weekend that signals the start of the summer holiday season. All 50 states have reopened for business in some fashion \u2013 some much more restricted than others \u2013 and the public is heading to the beaches, bars and bowling alleys. There is potential for chaos and risk of infection. <strong tabindex=\"-1\">Fauci said last night: \u201cGo out, wear a mask. Stay six feet away from anyone you see.\u201d</strong> Not everyone will be taking that advice and some local leaders are not echoing that message. Donald Trump last night ordered flags to fly at half staff on federal buildings and national monuments over the weekend, to mark the deaths from coronavirus and to honor America\u2019s military dead.</li> \n   <li><strong>Donald Trump hit out last night at the attorney general of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/michigan\">Michigan</a>, Dana Nessel, after she severely</strong> <strong>criticized his refusal to don a mask</strong> for the cameras at the Ford factory he visited in the state yesterday, as an example to others and to comply with Michigan law, even if he, as he said, had tested negative for coronavirus that morning. She called him a \u201cpetulant child\u201d, he called her a \u201cwacky do nothing\u201d, so that\u2019s all useful stuff. Pictures <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/22/pictures-show-donald-trump-wearing-mask-after-ford-factory-row\">did emerge</a>, as the president predicted they would, of him wearing a mask behind the scenes before he stepped in front of the assembled media and told them he didn\u2019t want to give the press the pleasure of seeing it.</li> \n   <li><strong>Democratic congressional leaders <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/nancy-pelosi\">Nancy Pelosi</a> and Chuck Schumer had asked the president to lower the flags to mark the grim milestone of 100,000 US deaths from coronavirus, which will be reached any day now</strong>. Trump chose his own way of doing it. The number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the US has now surpassed 1.57m and the death toll has surpassed 94,000.</li> \n   <li><strong>The US has called on the World Health Organization (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/world-health-organization\">WHO</a>) today to begin work immediately on investigating the source of the coronavirus, as well as its own handling of the response to the pandemic.</strong><br>Brett Giroir, US Assistant Secretary for Health, told the WHO\u2019s executive board in a written statement: \u201cThere is no time to waste to begin on the reforms needed to ensure such a pandemic never happens again.\u201d<br>An independent, comprehensive review of the WHO-led global response \u2013 as agreed in a resolution adopted by the WHO\u2019s annual ministerial assembly on Tuesday \u2013 should seek \u201ccomplete and transparent understanding of the source, timeline of events, and decision-making process for the WHO\u2019s response to the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/27/what-is-covid-19\">Covid-19</a> pandemic\u201d, he said.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></li> \n   <li>White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany has scheduled a press briefing at 2pm ET.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n</div>"
