[but] sometimes, if you\u2019re alone and you\u2019re fighting someone, it\u2019s tough,\u201d he said in an interview with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/fox-news\">Fox News</a> on Friday.</p> \n<p>He gave an example of a \u201creally bad person\u201d confronting a police officer and said that situation had played out amid the protests, which were sparked after a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on Floyd\u2019s neck for almost nine minutes during an arrest attempt in May.</p> \n<p>The autopsy report concluded homicide and the now former officer, Derek Chauvin, was charged with murder. A video by a witness went viral and spurred protests over police bias and brutality and wider issues of societal racism.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou saw some very good people protesting, but you saw some bad people also,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd you get somebody in a chokehold. What are you going to do now? Let go and say, \u2018Oh, let\u2019s start all over again\u2019?\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump later said be believed chokeholds to be theoretically acceptable, but he acknowledged they are often used inappropriately by police.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think the concept of chokeholds sounds so innocent and so perfect,\u201d Trump said, adding that \u201cyou have to be careful. With that being said, it would be, I think, a very good thing that, generally speaking, it should be ended.\u201d</p> \n<p>The remarks followed action by a number of US cities and states towards banning police chokeholds. In the latest such move, the New York governor, Andrew Cuomo<strong> </strong>signed legislation on Friday morning to ban chokeholds in the state.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\"

  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/09/burundi-president-dies-illness-suspected-coronavirus-pierre-nkurunziz\">Pierre Nkurunziza</a>, who has died unexpectedly aged 55, was the outgoing president of Burundi whose 15-year-rule, particularly towards the end, was marked by brutal repression.</p> <p>In 2015, Nkurunziza\u2019s decision to run for an unconstitutional third term led to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/10/burundi-ethnic-violence-refugees\">an outbreak of protests and violence </a>that spread across the country. He responded with brutal violence. Over the next two years, his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2017/apr/19/un-human-rights-chief-condemns-grotesque-rape-chants-burundi-youth-militia\">youth-led militia group</a>, known as the Imbonerakure, as well as various state security forces, <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/09/fear-warns-burundi-atrocities-polls-190904133751594.html\">killed </a><a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/09/fear-warns-burundi-atrocities-polls-190904133751594.html\">more than 1,200 Burundians</a> in an attempt to quash street protests. Four hundred thousand more fled the country. A born-again Christian, Nkurunziza spent much of that time organising prayer meetings.</p> <p>When donors cut aid, he retaliated by barring most foreign media outlets from reporting inside Burundi. When the <a href=\"https://www.icc-cpi.int/burundi\">international criminal court (ICC) </a>opened an investigation into crimes against humanity in 2017, he responded by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/law/2017/oct/28/burundi-becomes-first-nation-to-leave-international-criminal-court\">withdrawing Burundi from the Rome statute</a>; the first nation ever to do so. In 2019, he went a step further and shut down the <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=24254&amp;LangID=E\">U</a><a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=24254&amp;LangID=E\">N\u2019s </a><a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/en/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=24254&amp;LangID=E\">human rights office </a>in the country after 23 years, claiming he had made sufficient progress in human rights.</p> <p>Yet when Nkurunziza first came to power following the 1993-2005 Burundian civil war, which pitted Hutu rebels against the Tutsi-led army, he had seemed genuinely committed to the ideals of peace and democracy. As the leader of the CNDD\u2013FDD (National Council for the Defence of Democracy \u2013 Forces for the Defence of Democracy) Hutu rebel group, he had begun negotiating a peace deal in 2001. Two years later he signed the <a href=\"https://peacemaker.un.org/node/1207\">Arusha agreement</a>, which ended the civil war, in which 300,000 people died. He transformed his rebel group into a political party and joined the transition government as a minister for good governance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7a180bcca7db08b01c48deea4377ea52d8f88853\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a180bcca7db08b01c48deea4377ea52d8f88853/946_0_4526_3273/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pierre Nkurunziza, riding a bicycle, with his wife, Denise Bucumi, right, go to vote in the 2015 presidential election, in his birthplace of Ngozi.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"723\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pierre Nkurunziza, riding a bicycle, with his wife, Denise Bucumi, right, go to vote in the 2015 presidential election, in his birthplace of Ngozi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Berthier Mugiraneza/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2005 Nkurunziza became president after his party won the elections by a landslide. A year later he lifted a curfew that had been in place since 1972. In 2007 Burundian soldiers joined an African Union (AU) peacekeeping force in troubled Somalia. The <a href=\"https://umoya.org/2009/03/13/burundi-paris-club-creditors-cancel-burundis-debt/\">Paris Club group</a> of creditors cancelled Burundi\u2019s debt in 2009.&nbsp;</p> <p>But after being re-elected with 92% of the vote in the 2010 poll, which was boycotted by many opposition candidates, Nkurunziza became increasingly authoritarian, power-hungry and intolerant. In 2014 <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-27818254\">he even banned jogging</a> out of \u201cfears it could be used by his opponents as a cover for subversion\u201d.</p> <p>Burundi was inching so close to another Hutu-Tutsi conflict that in 2016 the AU approved a pre-emptive deployment of a 5,000-strong <a href=\"https://theglobalobservatory.org/2016/02/burundi-nkurunziza-african-union-maprobu/\">African Prevention and Protection Mission </a>in Burundi, which has yet to be deployed because Nkurunziza objected to it.&nbsp;</p> <p>Colonisation has produced many crises that continue to haunt post-independence Africa but few have been as destructive as the Hutu-Tutsi divide. In neighbouring <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-26875506\">Rwanda in 1994 it fuelled a genocide in which 800,000 </a>mostly Tutsis were killed by the Hutus. Twenty years earlier, in Burundi, it led to a wave of mass killing of mostly Hutus by the Tutsi-led army following a failed Hutu coup in 1972. Experts estimated that more than 100,000 people were killed.</p> <p>Like Rwanda, the 1972 killings affected Burundi so deeply that it has become a defining political factor. Almost all recent Hutu leaders, including the country\u2019s first democratically elected president, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melchior_Ndadaye#:~:text=Melchior%20Ndadaye%20(March%2028%2C%201953,a%20Burundian%20intellectual%20and%20politician.&amp;text=His%20assassination%20sparked%20an%20array,decade%2Dlong%20Burundi%20Civil%20War.\">Melchior Ndadaye</a>, whose assassination triggered the 1993 civil war, was a 1972 refugee. Nkurunziza\u2019s father, Eustache Ngabisha, a former member of parliament and governor of Ngozi and Kayansi provinces, was a victim of the 1972 ethnic killings. Nkurunziza was eight years old at the time of his death.&nbsp;</p> <p>Born in Ngozi, Nkurunziza was the son of Ngabisha and of Domitille (nee Minani), a Tutsi assistant nurse. After his father\u2019s death, his family moved to Gitega, where Nkurunziza attended Athen\u00e9e de Gitega secondary school.</p> <p>A fitness enthusiast and keen footballer who in later life owned his own team, Hallelujah FC, Nkurunziza studied physical education at the University of Burundi. After graduation in 1990, he worked as a high school PE teacher at Muramvya high school. He married Denise Bucumi, who later became a pastor, in 1994.</p> <p>The following year, while working as a lecturer at the University of Burundi, in Bujumbura, Nkurunziza was shot at during a Tutsi attack on the campus, which killed hundreds of students. He joined one of several rebel Hutu groups, CNDD\u2013FDD, as a soldier.&nbsp;Two of his six siblings were killed after civil war erupted in 1993 and three others died while fighting with CNDD-FDD. By 1998 Nkurunziza was promoted to deputy secretary-general of the group, and in 2001 became its leader.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cb01ebc0ae6464f3f642b53c6eb0b7a1da884e10\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cb01ebc0ae6464f3f642b53c6eb0b7a1da884e10/0_11_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anti-government protestors in Bujumbura, 2015.

His fellow party member Evariste Ndayishimiye won last month\u2019s presidential election. Nkurunziza was elevated to the status of \u201cParamount Leader and Champion of Patriotism\u201d, a title that came with a $535,000 retirement package and villa.&nbsp;</p> <p>His cause of death was officially given as a heart attack, yet many suspect it was Covid-19.&nbsp;Ten days before his death, his wife was airlifted to Kenya for treatment for coronavirus symptoms, <a href=\"https://www.nation.co.ke/dailynation/news/burundi-first-lady-denise-nkurunziza-airlifted-to-nairobi-for-treatment-310894\">according to the Daily Nation</a>.

He should, regardless, still win the electoral college votes of Oklahoma, a solidly Republican-voting state.</p> <p>The rally has already proved controversial, however, because of the site and the date.

The book is now due out on 23 June.</p> <p>Bolton was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/10/trump-fires-john-bolton-national-security-adviser\">ousted</a> last September after months of disagreement over America\u2019s foreign policy approach, especially Trump\u2019s freewheeling ways, amid revelations of searing internal divisions within Trump\u2019s inner circle. Trump said he had \u201cdisagreed strongly\u201d with Bolton, who claimed he was in the process of resigning when Trump moved to fire him.</p> <p>According to the release on Friday, the new book \u201cargues that the House committed impeachment malpractice by keeping their prosecution focused narrowly on Ukraine when Trump\u2019s Ukraine-like transgressions existed across the full range of his foreign policy <strong>\u2013 </strong>and Bolton documents exactly what those were, and attempts by him and others in the administration to raise alarms about them\u201d.</p> <p>Critics will probably pounce on Bolton for not publicly raising concerns about these \u201ctransgressions\u201d while they were occurring \u2013 and for later refusing to testify to the House about them. Bolton refused to provide a deposition during the impeachment inquiry.</p> <p>Bolton also criticizes Trump for focusing solely on his chances of re-election as he made major policy decisions. \u201cI am hard-pressed to identify any significant Trump decision during my tenure that wasn\u2019t driven by re-election calculations,\u201d he writes.</p>",

People have taken to the streets in Paris and Berlin, Tel Aviv and Stockholm; Floyd\u2019s face has been painted as a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HaraldDoornbos/status/1270437663003246594\">mural on a shattered wall</a> in Idlib, Syria. \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d has become a universal slogan. Floyd once told a high school classmate, \u201cI want to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/podcasts/the-daily/george-floyd-protests-funeral.html?showTranscript=1\">touch the world</a>\u201d. And he has.</p> <p>Of course, the protests are not solely in solidarity with Floyd and black Americans. In each country, they have been rooted in the very specific <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aamnamohdin/status/1271010943422599169\">experience of that </a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/aamnamohdin/status/1271010943422599169\">country</a>. But America was the spur to action. Bristolians had been campaigning for years against the statue of Edward Colston. But it took the killing of a man in faraway Minnesota <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/08/edward-colston-statue-history-slave-trader-bristol-protest\">to bring it down</a>, and spark a national inquiry into who and what gets memorialised in stone and bronze \u2013 the debate that got Johnson\u2019s Twitter finger twitching, and to which we shall return.</p> <p>It\u2019s a paradox. The world denounces the racism that remains the defining birth defect of the United States, pointing its collective finger at that country to shame it \u2013 and yet, by that very act of castigation, it confirms America\u2019s power. The US is still the global arena, the place where issues that vex every nation are played out. It remains the reflecting glass in which so much of the world sees itself.</p> <p>Racism offers a clear example. There is hate in every country, of course, but largely thanks to its colonisation of the global imagination through TV and movies, America\u2019s horrors are endowed with a vivid, even epic quality that somehow renders them uniquely universal. A killingin Minneapolis can trigger a global reaction, in a way that one in Manchester never would. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHBKmT6eNGw\">Gene Hackman</a> never starred in a film called Brixton Burning.</p> <p>The result is that an episode that should be damaging for America\u2019s global influence, its soft power, somehow only adds to it. Just as capitalism can co-opt and profit from anticapitalism \u2013 with corporations now seizing on the slogan Black Lives Matter as a useful bit of <a href=\"https://www.personneltoday.com/hr/global-businesses-embrace-black-lives-matter-movement/\">ad copy</a> \u2013 so the US can gain from its failure to address the racism that has disfigured it since the founding of the republic.</p> <p>We shouldn\u2019t be surprised. This is a country that can turn even its most dysfunctional excesses into commercial gold \u2013 witness <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/20/tiger-king-joe-exotic-netflix-series\">Netflix\u2019s Tiger King</a> \u2013 and it has done so for decades. While Britain tried to hush up its atrocities overseas, even burning incriminating documents through the so-called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/nov/29/revealed-bonfire-papers-empire\">Operation </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/nov/29/revealed-bonfire-papers-empire\">Legacy</a>, Hollywood made a cottage industry of examining, for example, the Vietnam war, cementing its place in international pop culture. And so while British teenagers in the 1980s might know nothing of Britain\u2019s brutal crushing of the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-12997138\">Mau Mau insurgency</a> in Kenya, they certainly did know that the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sajngb0W6I\">average age of a US </a>combat soldier in Vietnam<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sajngb0W6I\"> </a>was 19.</p> <p>This dynamic works well for America, but it should have the rest of us on our guard. For the aftermath of Floyd\u2019s death has revealed the risks of importing yet another trademark US product: namely, the culture war.</p> <p>Take Johnson and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BorisJohnson/status/1271388180193914880\">those tweets</a>. The language (and punctuation) may not have been Trumpian, but the form is pure Trump. Not a speech, not a TV interview, but a direct, unfiltered appeal via social media to his base, and on a topic calculated to polarise public opinion. Cannily, Johnson avoided the question of slaver statues, opting to speak instead in defence of the Whitehall <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/10/far-right-protesters-plan-defence-of-statues-such-as-churchills\">memorial to Winston Churchill</a> defaced by protesters last weekend. You don\u2019t need a poll to tell you that the PM is likely to have a comfortable majority on his side for that one.</p> <p>There is a lesson here for campaigners and activists, a lesson from America. The right loves a culture war, because such a battle changes the subject \u2013 almost always shifting from ground on which they would lose to ground on which they can win.</p> <p>Let\u2019s imagine the initial focus had remained instead on a demand to tackle <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/11/honour-george-floyd-learn-lessons-lawrence-inquiry\">discrimination in policing and criminal justice</a>, expanding to include the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/02/covid-19-death-rate-in-england-higher-among-bame-people\">higher death rates</a> from Covid-19 among black Britons. Johnson and others in power would now be on the defensive, forced to promise action.</p> <p>But once the focus shifted, they could exhale with relief. Not only is a debate about statues or faulty <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/jun/11/fawlty-towers-dont-mention-the-war-episode-removed-from-uktv\">TV shows</a> a handy distraction from the specific injustices at the heart of all this, it also splits the coalition, even the consensus, that had, remarkably, formed in revulsion at Floyd\u2019s killing. Once statues of Gandhi and Mandela are also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PickardJE/status/1271373255329435650\">boarded</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/PickardJE/status/1271373255329435650\"> up for their own protection</a>, as they now are, it means precious unity has been lost.</p> <p>Of course, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/08/edward-colston-statue-history-slave-trader-bristol-protest\">the case against </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jun/08/edward-colston-statue-history-slave-trader-bristol-protest\">memorials to slavers</a> is cast-iron and just. But widening the focus allows those in charge to stop talking about something hard for them, and shift to something much easier. US-style culture wars don\u2019t just poison the air: even when progressives win, victory often comes at the expense of the structural change that might matter more. In America, celebrities have been coaxed to make the right noises on race for years \u2013 and all the while the Minneapolis police department was left untouched.</p> <p>So let\u2019s be wary of adopting one of the US\u2019s most unappetising exports. Let\u2019s borrow instead the slogan, and wisdom, of its civil rights movement of nearly 60 years ago \u2013 and keep eyes on the prize.</p> <p>\u2022 Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist</p>",

  "<p>Gay rights and homophobia are likely to be major issues in Poland\u2019s delayed presidential election after the frontrunner pledged to \u201cdefend children from LGBT ideology\u201d.</p> <p>Andrzej Duda, the incumbent president, who is allied with the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party, made the pledge while launching a so-called \u201cfamily charter\u201d. The move appeared designed to energise the party\u2019s conservative base as polls showed his lead narrowing.</p> <p>After the vote was moved from 10 May to 28 June owing to the coronavirus pandemic, the liberal mayor of Warsaw, Rafa\u0142 Trzaskowski, entered the race, and polls suggest that in a run-off against Duda the vote could be split almost evenly.</p> <p>Trzaskowski, of the centre-right Civic Platform, has been a supporter of LGBT rights as Warsaw mayor. He attended Warsaw\u2019s pride event, the first time a mayor of the capital has done so.</p> <p>PiS has been accused of <a href=\"Incumbent%20president\">democratic backsliding and erosion of the rule of law</a> since winning a parliamentary majority in 2015. It has often hit out at gay rights and what it calls \u201cLGBT ideology\u201d, in rhetoric that is popular with parts of its base and the Catholic church.</p> <p>Among other things, Duda\u2019s new charter pledges no support for gay marriage or adoption by gay couples, with Duda describing the latter as part of \u201ca foreign ideology\u201d. It also seeks to \u201cban the propagation of LGBT ideology\u201d in schools and public institutions \u2013 language reminiscent of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/17/vladimir-putin-gay-winter-olympics-children\">notorious Russian law</a> targeting so-called \u201cgay propaganda\u201d.</p> <p>There has been a concerted effort to portray the centrist Trzaskowski as an anti-Polish radical. Last week the pro-government weekly Sieci <a href=\"https://twitter.com/notesfrompoland/status/1269633753611149312\">featured Trzaskowski on its cover</a> wearing a rainbow armband and black hoodie, with the caption \u201cthe extremist candidate\u201d.</p> <p>Jacek Karnowski, the editor-in-chief of Sieci, said the magazine had chosen the cover because the politician was presenting himself as moderate when in fact, during his time as mayor of Warsaw, \u201che was trying to introduce LGBT ideology into schools and public life\u201d. Karnowski said PiS was focusing on the LGBT issue because it \u201cresonates on an emotional level\u201d with a large part of the Polish population.</p> <p>Government and church leaders have on various occasions compared \u201cLGBT ideology\u201d to communism, Nazism and the plague. Marek J\u0119draszewski, the archbishop of Krak\u00f3w, used an address to mark the religious holiday of Corpus Christi on Thursday to denounce foreign ideologies that he said \u201cundermine the institution of marriage and the family\u201d.</p> <p>The messaging does have an effect. In a survey last year, when asked to name the biggest threat to Poland, the most popular answer among men under 40 was \u201cthe LGBT movement and gender ideology\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6c25d1de1bfec97c17176d11cb4418dcb3eb0c42\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c25d1de1bfec97c17176d11cb4418dcb3eb0c42/0_127_4045_2429/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People with rainbow flags take part in a flashmob in front of the presidential palace in Warsaw.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People with rainbow flags taking part in a flashmob in front of the presidential palace in Warsaw this week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Czarek Soko\u0142owski/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In a statement addressed to Duda this week, Poland\u2019s Campaign Against Homophobia said: \u201cMr President, let us say it out loudly and clearly once again: there is no such thing as \u2018LGBT ideology\u2019, it\u2019s just a homophobic construct. LGBTs are lesbians, gays, bisexual and transgender persons who personally experience the consequences of homophobic and transphobic hate which you also fuel.\u201d</p> <p>On Thursday evening dozens of LGBT people and supporters gathered outside the presidential palace in Warsaw for a \u201csilent disco\u201d in protest at Duda\u2019s charter. A number of opposition politicians called on people not to attend the protest, saying images of it would be used as propaganda and could help PiS win the election.</p> <p>Those present were angry at Duda\u2019s messaging and also at the lack of support from other candidates. \u201cWe need solidarity, but almost all the candidates in the presidential election are scared to be associated with the LGBT community, and that\u2019s scary,\u201d said Jvlia \u015awi\u0119ch, one of those involved in creating the event.</p> <p>The election was originally scheduled for May as the PiS leader, Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, was keen to take advantage of polling that suggested Duda would win easily in the first round. It was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/11/poland-holds-ghost-election-with-0-turnout\">called off with days to go</a> and rescheduled. Poland has since relaxed many lockdown rules, although it is recording more new infections a day than in May.</p> <p>Recent polls suggest the race will be much closer, with Duda projected to win around 40% of the votes in the first round, requiring a second-round run-off that would be held two weeks later.</p>",
  "<p>Amid a continuing pandemic and a painful national introspection on race, a volatile American economy is also forcing Donald Trump and Joe Biden to recalibrate how they campaign in 2020\u2019s presidential election.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/jun/11/us-economy-unemployment-us-states\">Stock markets tumble as another 1.5m Americans file for unemployment</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For Trump, any positive news about the economy needs to be trumpeted. That\u2019s what the president did when the most recent unemployment figures came in surprisingly lower than expected, at 13.3%.</p> <p>For Biden, Trump\u2019s Democratic opponent in the 2020 presidential election, the approach is to remind voters that the soaring unemployment numbers are unacceptably high. Virtually every time he can, Biden looks to link the virus-cratered economy to Trump.</p> <p>But as with many other things in 2020, there is nothing normal or easy to predict about the US economy as the election unfolds.</p> <p>Unlike normal recessions, the devastation unleashed on the American jobs market has come about because of deliberate shutdown policies aimed at curbing the pandemic\u2019s spread. That makes blaming Trump for the 40 million plus new jobless Americans a little more difficult.</p> <p>By the same token, coaxing the economy back into life is not just a matter of trying to stimulate demand or tinkering with interest rates. It is instead deeply entwined with public health policy, where reopening the artificially shut-down economy could cost tens of thousands of US lives.</p> <p>That situation poses problems for both contenders as they seek to make the economy central to their campaigns.</p> <p>Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who served as the 2008 John McCain campaign\u2019s director of domestic and economic policy, said the challenge for Biden and Trump is different as they seek to persuade voters they have the answers to solve the problems posed by an economic freefall driven by a virus.</p> <p>\u201cFor the Biden campaign, the challenge is to ask themselves every day: \u2018OK, what looks presidential in this moment?\u2019\u201d Holtz-Eakin said. \u201cBoth have to appear presidential, but Trump in particular has to be a source of trustworthy information.</p> <p>\u201cPeople derive great comfort from someone who can tell them what\u2019s happening.\u201d</p> <p>For Trump, he either needs to communicate a convincing argument to be optimistic that he can lead the economic recovery, or show that Biden is a worse alternative.</p> <p>A swath of recent polling has shown Biden beating Trump in a general election matchup. But on the economy, Trump is still competitive. A recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found that a plurality of voters still think Trump is preferable on dealing with the economy and cutting the unemployment rate.</p> <p>Trump has habitually pointed to certain metrics \u2013 such as the stock market \u2013 to argue that he\u2019s the stronger candidate on the economy. He also likes to say Democrats are the party that wants to raise taxes.</p> <p>Holtz-Eakin expects Trump to focus more on bashing Biden as the election nears, regardless of how the economy is doing on any particular day.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3cf984203adfab9aa199a329835721683c8e1da6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3cf984203adfab9aa199a329835721683c8e1da6/12_0_5296_3179/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Biden at an economic roundtable discussion in.

He and his campaign, publicly and privately, have put a heavy focus on race relations, and the unrest around the police killing of George Floyd. Talking points sent to some Biden surrogates on Monday and obtained by the Guardian did not mention the economy, and instead focused on Floyd.</p> <p>But Biden\u2019s fundraising schedule this week includes multiple economy-related events, according to invitations obtained by the Guardian.</p> <p>One fundraiser on Wednesday was labeled a \u201cVirtual Conversation on Rebuilding a Most Resilient Health Economy after Covid-19\u201d. Another fundraiser featured Peter Orszag, the former director for the Office of Management and Budget during the Obama administration.</p> <p>In public remarks, Biden has also eagerly pivoted to addressing the economy and laying out his policy platform.</p> <p>\u201cTrump&nbsp;has loved to crow about the great&nbsp;economy&nbsp;he built. But when the crisis hit, it became clear who that&nbsp;economy&nbsp;has been built to serve. Not workers. Not the middle class. Not families,\u201d Biden said in recent public remarks.</p> <p>In addressing the economy, Biden often ties it to race relations or the coronavirus. On Thursday, Biden\u2019s campaign released a new factsheet titled \u201cThe Biden Plan for an Effective Re-Opening that Jumpstarts the Economy\u201d.

That in turn triggered white mobs to attack black businesses, homes and individuals.</p> \n<p>Over two days of violence, according to a later Red Cross estimate, 1,256 houses were burned, and two newspaper offices, a school, a library, a hospital, churches, hotels, stores and black-owned businesses were among the buildings destroyed or damaged by fire.</p> \n<p>Although the official tally at the time claimed just 36 people had been killed, historians believe the number to be considerably higher. In 2001, the report of the Race Riot Commission suggested there were between 100 and 300 deaths.</p> \n<p>The US journalist <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DanRather/status/1270841047988318208?s=20\">Dan Rather said on Twitter</a>: \u201cSo. Let\u2019s set the stage... President Trump has chosen as the venue for his first rally in months, Tulsa, Oklahoma, site of a horrific massacre of African Americans. And he has set the date for June 19th, Juneteenth, a celebration of the end of slavery in the United States.\u201d</p> \n<p>The LA Times tweeted on its official account: \u201cThe Trump rally will occur on Juneteenth Day, when many Americans commemorate the end of slavery, in a city that was home to an infamous 1921 massacre of Black people, one of the worst racial atrocities in the nation\u2019s history.\u201d</p> \n<p>Katrina Pierson, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign, said that as the party of Lincoln, Republicans were proud of the history of Juneteenth.</p> \n<p>The campaign was aware that the date for the president\u2019s return to rallies was Juneteenth, according to two campaign officials, who were not authorised to speak publicly about internal discussions and spoke on condition of anonymity.</p> \n<p>They said that when the date was discussed, it was noted that Biden had held a fundraiser a year ago on Juneteenth. Although choosing 19 June was not meant to be incendiary, some blowback was expected, the officials said. But the campaign was caught off guard by the intensity, particularly when some linked the selection to the 1921 massacre.</p> \n<p><em>Associated Press contributed to this report</em></p>",

LaTosha Brown, a co-founder of Black Voters Matter,<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/06/09/georgia-primary-election-voting-309066\"> told Politico</a> it took her three hours to vote in her majority African American precinct in Atlanta on Tuesday, but she saw no line at a polling place in a predominantly white area later in the day.

Donald Trump is already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/trump-mail-in-voting-election-2020-election-attacks\">making repeated baseless accusations</a> of voter fraud in what appears to be an effort to lay the foundation for contesting the legitimacy of the 2020 election.</p> <p>Activists were already deeply concerned about the mass closure of polling places and the Covid-19 pandemic has given election officials justification for doing so. More than 1,600 polling places in jurisdictions previously covered by the Voting Rights Act were closed between 2012 and 2018,<a href=\"https://civilrights.org/democracy-diverted/\"> according to a report </a>by the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. That includes <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/voting-precincts-closed-across-georgia-since-election-oversight-lifted/bBkHxptlim0Gp9pKu7dfrN/\">214 polling places </a>in Georgia.</p> <p>Democrats and voting rights groups are also pushing states across the country to extend the deadline by which absentee ballots need to arrive to be counted. Many states require the ballots to arrive by election night, a cutoff that could leave eligible voters disenfranchised. In Wisconsin, Democrats secured a court order requiring the state to count ballots as long as they were postmarked before election day and arrived within six days of the election.</p> <p>More than <a href=\"https://elections.wi.gov/sites/elections.wi.gov/files/2020-05/May%2020%2C%202020.Final_.pdf\">79,000 ballots</a> that normally would have been thrown out were counted during the extension (Trump won the state in 2016 by just under 23,000 votes).&nbsp;</p> <p>There is also growing concern about plummeting voter registration in recent months and an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/18/us/Voting-republicans-trump.html\">unprecedented </a>Republican effort to monitor the polls and challenge the eligibility of voters who appear, something that could result in voter intimidation. The Republican National Committee, freed from a decades-old court order prohibiting them from such activity, is seeking to recruit up to 50,000 volunteers.</p> <p>The window for states to understand the problems from their primaries and implement solutions for November is rapidly closing. Recommended deadlines for purchasing necessary equipment and other measures are approaching and in some cases have <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/preparing-election-day-deadlines-running-safe-election\">already passed</a>. Republicans in Congress have also scaled back funding to help states run elections, allocating just $400m so far, a small fraction of the billions experts say is needed. The Republican National Committee also plans to spend at least $20m to oppose efforts to expand vote by mail.</p> <p>\u201cIf no one, legislators/advocates/voters/election officials, listens to what is being said it will be a debacle in November,\u201d Tammy Patrick, who works on election administration at the Democracy Fund, said in an email. \u201cThe primaries have been the canary in the coalmine.\u201d&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2df0a2519fd7ebb296c59cef615f46223f7f041b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2df0a2519fd7ebb296c59cef615f46223f7f041b/0_181_5465_3281/1000.jpg\" alt=\"New state-issued voting machines proved problematic in a number of locations in Georgia\u2019s primary.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">New state-issued voting machines proved problematic in a number of locations in Georgia\u2019s primary.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Erik S Lesser/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, there have been some encouraging signs. After Wisconsin\u2019s chaotic April primary, the state\u2019s bipartisan election commission released a <a href=\"https://elections.wi.gov/sites/elections.wi.gov/files/2020-05/May%2020%2C%202020.Final_.pdf\">detailed analysis</a> of what went wrong and unanimously voted to send an absentee ballot application to all voters who <a href=\"https://madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/elections-commission-approves-sending-absentee-ballot-applications-to-2-7-million/article_4f2cd7af-4e3a-58ef-8f26-d30333e6528f.html\">hadn\u2019t requested one</a> for November. The commission also moved to give local clerks \u2013 who were overwhelmed by ballot requests during the primary \u2013 more help. California <a href=\"https://www.gov.ca.gov/2020/05/08/governor-newsom-issues-executive-order-to-protect-public-health-by-mailing-every-registered-voter-a-ballot-ahead-of-the-november-general-election/\">announced in May </a>&nbsp;it would send a ballot to all registered voters. Michigan \u2013 which saw long lines at some election offices during its March primary \u2013 is also sending an absentee ballot application to all voters.&nbsp;</p> <p>But other signs suggest states may move in the opposite direction. In Georgia, Brad Raffensperger, the state\u2019s top election official, refused to acknowledge systemic problems in the way the election was run this week, instead blaming local election officials. In Iowa, Republicans<a href=\"https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2020/06/05/iowa-senate-republicans-propose-limiting-absentee-ballot-request-forms-paul-pate-covid-19/3155908001/\"> are considering legislation</a> that would prohibit the secretary of state, Paul Pate, from sending absentee ballot applications to all voters, something Pate, a Republican, did ahead of the state\u2019s June primary when there was record turnout. Ohio Republicans are also considering legislation that would<a href=\"https://www.cleveland.com/open/2020/06/ohio-house-passes-bill-restricting-future-changes-to-elections.html\"> bar the state\u2019s</a> top election official from paying for postage on absentee ballot requests and the ballots themselves.</p> <p>\u201cOn the one hand, it\u2019s very concerning,\u201d said Amber McReynolds, CEO of the National Vote at Home Institute, which is <a href=\"https://www.voteathome.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/VAHScale_StrategyPlan.pdf\">advising election officials</a> on how to prepare for November. \u201cOn the other, what I would say is that this is a wake-up call.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Stacey Abrams, the 2018 Democratic nominee in Georgia who put voting rights at the core of her campaign, said some states were better positioned for November \u201cbecause those states have an intention of actually letting every person vote\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt is not that we don\u2019t know the answer. It is that the Republican party in particular has been resistant to solving the problem and that will put our elections in jeopardy,\u201d she said.</p>",

  "<p>Welcome to this week\u2019s roundup of developments from the coronavirus pandemic. As more countries ease out of lockdown, scientists shed light on how the virus attacks and raise questions over the wastewater that drains from sinks and bathrooms.</p> \n<h2>Lockdowns work</h2> \n<p>Substantial lockdowns around the world have taken their toll on millions of lives and dented economies globally. So it was a relief to hear that the bluntest tool of all in the outbreak management toolbox did actually work. Lockdowns in Europe saved more than 3 million lives, including an estimated 470,000 in the UK, 690,000 in France, and 630,000 in Italy, according to researchers at Imperial College London.</p> \n<p>Outbreak modellers found that lockdowns slashed the average number of people that contagious individuals infected by 81%. In the UK, that amounted to lowering the all-important reproduction number of the virus, R, from 3.8 to 0.63, the researchers <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2405-7\">reported in Nature</a>. In 11 countries from France and Germany to Spain and Italy, lockdowns pushed the R value below one, meaning the epidemics went into decline.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/10/global-report-eu-nations-continue-steady-exits-from-lockdown\">Global report: EU nations continue steady exits from lockdown</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The modelling showed that by 4 May between 12 million and 15 million people in those countries had been infected by coronavirus but \u201cattack rates\u201d varied dramatically, from 0.46% of Norwegians infected to 8% of Belgians. In the UK an estimated 5.1% of people were infected. Prof Axel Gandy, a statistician on the team, said the model suggested \u201cwe are very far away from herd immunity\u201d, where at least two-thirds of the population need to have acquired protective immunity to the disease. \u201cWe need to tread very carefully,\u201d he added.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2404-8\">More work on lockdowns</a> came from the University of California, Berkeley. Scientists there estimated that lockdowns in the US, France, China, South Korea and Iran had prevented about 530m infections. The research came as New Zealand\u2019s prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, declared the country virus-free and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/08/new-zealand-abandons-covid-19-restrictions-after-nation-declared-no-cases\">scrapped all coronavirus restrictions</a>, except strict border controls.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"634b5ed6-bc05-4cf6-9564-3cf587cdcfc3\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gTskXsdMwc0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Enter the virus</strong></h2> \n<p>Scientists worked out early on how the virus invades human cells and establishes infections. Spikes on the virus bind to so-called ACE-2 receptors that pepper the surfaces of many human cells, most importantly those in the respiratory tract. Once latched on, the virus gains entry and replicates over and over, until millions burst out to infect more cells.</p> \n<p>But that might not be the only way in. Separate teams led by the Technical University of Munich and Bristol University found that the virus attaches to a second human cell receptor called NRP1. Like ACE-2, it peppers cells in the respiratory tract, but it is also abundant in olfactory tissues, those that are used to smell.</p> \n<p>Both groups found that blocking the receptor prevented the virus from infecting human cells in the lab, adding weight to the idea that it is important. What is most intriguing about the receptor is that it may be a gateway to the brain, and in particular allow the virus to reach olfactory centres and potentially disrupt the sense of smell.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.07.137802v2\">two</a> <a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.06.05.134114v1\">papers</a> are tentative for now and have yet to be published in scientific journals. But if the results are sound, they might explain some of the disease\u2019s stranger symptoms and help to steer future vaccine design.</p> \n<h2><strong>Keep your distance</strong></h2> \n<p>Politicians on either sides of the Atlantic became embroiled in debates over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/10/science-behind-coronavirus-distancing-rules-2-metre\">safe distancing</a>. The US vice-president, Mike Pence, posted \u2013 and then swiftly deleted \u2013 a photo of President Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign staff displaying zero physical distancing. Meanwhile in the UK, the Tories <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/11/mps-pressure-boris-johnson-cut-2-metre-distancing-rule-tories-covid-19-england-uk-economy\">piled pressure on Boris Johnson</a> to reduce the 2-metre distancing guideline to 1 metre, amid concerns for the economy, in particular pubs, cafes and restaurants. Johnson made clear <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/09/englands-2-metre-distancing-rule-still-under-review\">he wants to ease the rule</a>, but uncertainty around whether the advice will be changed has caused chaos for councils and retailers, who may have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/11/uncertainty-over-2-metre-distancing-rule-in-england-causing-chaos\">wasted millions of pounds</a> on signs and other preparations for reopening the high streets.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/10/science-behind-coronavirus-distancing-rules-2-metre\">What is the science behind the UK's coronavirus distancing rules?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Prof Susan Michie, who sits on the behavioural science subgroup of the government\u2019s Sage committee of experts, said reducing the distance to 1m would undermine messages of how the virus is transmitted. \u201cIt seems to me that now is not the time to be lifting restrictions unless there\u2019s a very good argument.

Previous research has shown that the virus can survive for anything from four hours on a copper surface to five days on glass, with cardboard, plastic and wood all lying somewhere between. What was less clear was how often domestic objects and surfaces are contaminated with the virus.</p> \n<p>A team of virologists at the University of Bonn hunted for the virus in air samples, wastewater and on surfaces in 21 randomly selected households. All were in quarantine after at least one member had tested positive for the virus. None of the air samples tested positive for the virus, but among the water samples taken from sinks, showers and toilets, 15.5% contained the virus. Strikingly, tests on 119 surfaces, including door knobs, handles, electronic gadgets, furnishings, food and drink items, clothes, plants and pets, yielded only four positives. These came from one TV remote control, two metal doorknobs and one wooden stove overlay. The scientists could not grow infectious virus from any of the samples they collected.</p> \n<p>The researchers are not suggesting that people ease up on hand-washing or cleaning surfaces, particularly when sharing a home with an infected person. But <a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.28.20114041v1\">the work</a>, which has yet to be peer-reviewed, suggests that while wastewater deserves more attention, surfaces may not be a major source of infection.</p>",

Now the work begins</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Now James, arguably America\u2019s most prominent athlete, is seeking to galvanize black voters during nationwide unrest over the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. The Los Angeles Lakers star is forming More Than a Vote, a group with current and former basketball players aimed at protecting voting rights of Black Americans and bolstering voter turnout. According to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/us/politics/lebron-james-voting-rights.html\">the New York Times</a>, James and business partner Maverick Carter will reportedly provide the initial funding for More Than a Vote and the group will organize as a 501(c)(4) nonprofit organization, meaning it will not engage in any candidate advocacy.</p> <p>The nascent organization begins in the same week that <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/voting-june-9-primaries/2020/06/09/df6b8aa2-a9e7-11ea-a9d9-a81c1a491c52_story.html\">Georgia endured hours-long wait times</a>, malfunctioning voting machines and a shortage of poll workers during its primary.

James told the New York Times \u201cI\u2019m inspired by the likes of Muhammad Ali, I\u2019m inspired by the Bill Russells and the Kareem Abdul-Jabbars, the Oscar Robertsons \u2013 those guys who stood when the times were even way worse than they are today. Hopefully, someday down the line, people will recognize me not only for the way I approached the game of basketball, but the way I approached life as an African-American man.\u201d James hopes to use his extraordinary media influence \u2013 he has 66.1m Instagram followers, 46.4m Twitter followers and multiple digital platforms \u2013 to help boost voter turnout. Young said that he hopes to be an influence to other young black men, <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/05/12/black-voter-turnout-fell-in-2016-even-as-a-record-number-of-americans-cast-ballots/\">a group whose turnout declined in the 2016 presidential election</a>.</p> <p>Since the Supreme Court partially repealed the 1965 Voting Rights Act in the 2013 decision Shelby County v Holder, voter disenfranchisement has become one of the nation\u2019s most urgent political issues: Michelle Obama launched the voting rights organization When We All Vote in 2018 and Georgia politician Stacey Abrams launched Fair Fight Action after she narrowly lost the gubernatorial election to Brian Kemp, who oversaw the election as the presiding Secretary of State and was widely accused of rigging the election (Abrams sued Kemp through Fair Fight Action and the case is pending). More Than a Vote is expected to join forces with both organizations, though neither When We All Vote nor Fair Fight have confirmed any partnership with James\u2019s group.</p> <p>It\u2019s yet another bold undertaking from James, who has gone beyond the standard calls for change and charity donations. The LeBron James Family Foundation has spent millions underwriting college scholarships for low-income students to attend the University of Akron and his elementary school, I Promise, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/12/education/lebron-james-school-ohio.html\">posted excellent performances</a> in its first district assessments. James did not explicitly reference US president Donald Trump, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KingJames/status/911610455877021697\">whom James once called a \u201cbum\u201d</a>, but his move into the voting rights debate is direct action against a president <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/03/30/trump-voting-republicans/\">who has linked higher voter turnout</a> to increased likelihood of Republican losses in elections.</p> <p>The debate over voting rights is already one of the nation\u2019s most intense: The Trump administration adamantly opposes any expansion of vote-by-mail despite the public health threat of Covid-19 and Georgia\u2019s debacle during Tuesday\u2019s primaries was just one instance of voters facing long lines and faulty machinery to vote. In April, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/us/wisconsin-election-voting-rights.html\">the Supreme Court reversed a decision</a> to postpone the forthcoming election in Wisconsin by a week to assure that its residents could safely vote. The ruling forced thousands to go to the polls at the height of the pandemic. A report from the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation and Research indicates that voter registration is down 70% across 11 states compared to 2016, largely due to Covid-19 restrictions.</p> <p>Judging by his public comments, James envisions his foundation doing more than mass voter registration. \u201cYes, we want you to go out and vote, but we\u2019re also going to give you the tutorial,\u201d James told the Times. \u201cWe\u2019re going to give you the background of how to vote and what they\u2019re trying to do, the other side, to stop you from voting.\u201d</p>",

What other countries have handled racism or slavery better than the US? I\u2019m not saying that waving the red, white and blue; but so often people look at America and all they see is blatant acts of racism and then they are deaf, dumb and blind to racism in their own country. I understand why the US gets the scrutiny, because supposedly it\u2019s the cradle of democracy, and we do [racism] better than anyone else!&nbsp;</p> <p>Also, because of Hollywood. Because of television. It is my belief that the US is not a leader in the world because we have more nuclear weapons than anybody; it\u2019s the export of culture. Music, dance, Apple, Nike \u2013 that\u2019s how America dominates.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"ea592900232ee12b3f790161397aeafeea76d28b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea592900232ee12b3f790161397aeafeea76d28b/0_0_619_619/500.png\" alt=\"George Miller\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/07/mad-max-australian-cinema-ozploitation\">George Miller</a></strong><br>Director</h2> <p><strong>Why do you think we are impelled to tell each other stories?&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>First of all, I gotta give love!
