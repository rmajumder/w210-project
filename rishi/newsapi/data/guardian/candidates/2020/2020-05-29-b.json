About 175,000 had died.</li> \n   <li><strong>The number of Covid-19 cases linked to a live export ship which docked in Western Australia doubled from six to 12. </strong>Of these seven new cases recorded in the state on Thursday, six are crew members from the Al-Kuwait ship which docked in Fremantle this week.

But European diplomats said the US was half-hearted in its campaign and lost the tussle with China.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s interesting, looking at the last WHA meeting for me, was a very clear sign that American influence has diminished significantly,\u201d said Abraham Denmark, a former deputy assistant secretary of defence for East Asia. \u201cIt was embarrassing that we weren\u2019t able to wrangle international support for our policy goals in that meeting, and that China was able to really get what they needed out of that.\u201d</p> \n<p>The move appeared to confirm the suspicions of many in the WHO and in western capitals that Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/us-gives-g7-countries-a-list-of-reforms-it-wants-who-to-undertake\">never intended to seek reforms or open a dialogue with the WHO</a>, but left the body for political reasons.

He confirmed that the US would restrict entry to Chinese students, and cease to treat Hong Kong as autonomous, ending preferential trade relations.</p> \n<p>He also said there would be sanctions against Chinese officials.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe US will also take necessary steps to sanction PRC [People\u2019s Republic of China] and Hong Kong officials directly or indirectly involved in eroding Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy,\u201d he said.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/15/trump-turns-against-who-to-mask-his-own-stark-failings-on-covid-19-crisis\">Trump turns against WHO to mask his own stark failings on Covid-19 crisis</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Leaving the WHO would mean abrogating a treaty, the latest in a series of international agreements Trump has pulled out of.

Either the very weak Radical Left Mayor, Jacob Frey, get his act together and bring the City under control, or I will send in the National Guard &amp; get the job done right.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>In a second tweet, Trump wrote: \u201cThese THUGS are dishonoring the memory of George Floyd, and I won\u2019t let that happen \u2026 Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thank you!\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Twitter has since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/29/twitter-hides-donald-trump-tweet-glorifying-violence\">hidden</a> the second tweet behind a warning that it violated \u201cTwitter rules about glorifying violence\u201d, fanning the president\u2019s anger toward the social media company.&nbsp;</p> <p>Frey responded to the attack when a reporter read aloud Trump\u2019s tweets directed at him and the protests.&nbsp;\u201cLet me say this: weakness is refusing to take responsibility for your own actions. Weakness is pointing your finger at somebody else at a time of crisis,\u201d Frey said.</p> <p>The mayor shook his head when the reporter read that Trump called him a \u201cvery weak radical left mayor\u201d.</p> <p>Frey said: \u201cDonald Trump knows nothing about the strength of Minneapolis. We are strong as hell. This is a difficult time, yes, but you better be damn sure that we\u2019re going to get through this.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Late on Thursday night, the protests took a dramatic turn as a police precinct was set <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/george-floyd-minnesota-governor-national-guard-protests\">alight</a> by demonstrators. Police officers working in the precinct fled the building after unconfirmed reports that gas lines had been cut and explosives were in the area. Although no explosions went off in the night, the building continued to burn into the early hours of the morning.&nbsp;</p> <p>At the press conference, Frey said it was his call to evacuate officers from the building. \u201cThe symbolism of a building cannot outweigh the importance of life,\u201d he said.&nbsp;</p> <p>Frey also denounced the riots that were taking place in the context of the demonstrations.</p> <p>He said: \u201cWhat we have seen over the past several hours and past couple of nights is unacceptable. These are banks that people rely on to get cash, grocery stores that people rely on to get food. They are essential to our community.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier, Frey called on the district county attorney to arrest the officer who suffocated Floyd.</p> <p>\u201cIf most people, particularly people of color, had done what a police officer did late Monday, they\u2019d already be behind bars,\u201d Frey <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Jacob_Frey/status/1265708253264195586\">tweeted</a> on Wednesday.</p>",
  "<p>The US has shown \u201cgross incompetence \u2026 at the highest levels\u201d in dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic, according to Samantha Power, who served as US ambassador to the United Nations under Barack Obama.</p> <p>Speaking to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/philippe-sands\">Philippe Sands</a> for the online version of the Hay festival, Power said that Donald Trump\u2019s administration had failed to learn from the countries hit by the coronavirus before the US.</p> <p>\u201cWe could have had an awful lot in place before it struck in earnest on the continent,\u201d she said, highlighting the \u201cgross incompetence\u201d shown \u201cnot by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/15/coronavirus-us-health-care-worker-death-toll-higher-official-data-suggests\">the heroic health workers and public servants</a> who are on the frontlines, but at the highest levels, diminishing the threat posed by the pandemic in its early stages\u201d.</p> <p>Power served for four years as Obama\u2019s human rights adviser and from 2013 to 2017 in his cabinet and as US ambassador to the UN.

But the idea that that would be laid squarely on political globalisation or on alliances or on the United Nations, it was not accurate, it seemed like too big a leap to get the fuel and the momentum that Trump has given it, so we were wrong to underestimate that,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Power was asked by Sands if there was any coming back for the US after what he called \u201calmost irrecoverable\u201d damage done to the support for global order by the Trump presidency. Power said it wasn\u2019t just about Trump threatening to pull out of the World Health Organization, and withdrawing the US from organisations including Unesco and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/unitednations\">United Nations</a>&nbsp;human rights council.</p> <p>\u201cThere is that. But maybe even more damaging than that is the pullback from alliances that are at the heart of effective multilateralism \u2026 How do you recover the belief among German, French, British, Irish, Spanish citizens that when America attaches its name to an agreement, whether a climate agreement, or an Iran nuclear agreement, that is going to be an enduring signature?\u201d she said. \u201cWhat Trump has jeopardised more than anything is the sense of American constancy, [that] we\u2019re going to be there when you need us. And that\u2019s going to be the hardest thing of all, I think to build back that trust.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4a17f4c052b4d131e59f050c68d13df2433c3424\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a17f4c052b4d131e59f050c68d13df2433c3424/0_0_3397_2269/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Biden campaigning in Detroit in March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hopeful \u2026 Joe Biden campaigning in Detroit in March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Sancya/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Power was hopeful that Joe Biden will emerge the victor at this <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2020\">November\u2019s presidential election</a> due to Trump\u2019s handling of the pandemic. </p> <p>\u201cYou can holler <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/dec/18/what-is-fake-news-pizzagate\">fake news</a> and be kind of tribal in terms of your party mentality.

I\u2019m going to hand you over to my colleague <strong>Sarah Marsh</strong> in London. Here\u2019s the latest from the Minneapolis protests: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Protests against police brutality have continued in cities across the US, including Minneapolis, Denver, New York and Oakland following the killing of George Floyd. </strong>Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died in police custody after a white officer handcuffed hum kneeled on his neck for several minutes as Floyd pleaded that he could not breathe.</li> \n   <li><strong>In Minneapolis, police abandoned the 3rd precinct police station, which has been a major protest site.</strong> Crowds breached the station and set the entrance on fire. Elsewhere, businesses were looted and blazes set as the evening wore on.</li> \n   <li><strong>Donald Trump tweeted about the protests, calling those involved \u201cthugs\u201d and threatening to send in the national guard.</strong> Trump described the city\u2019s mayor, Jacob Frey, \u201cvery weak\u201d and wrote: \u201cwhen the looting starts, the shooting starts.\u201d</li> \n   <li><strong>In response, to the president\u2019s comments, Frey said during a press briefing: \u201cWeakness is pointing your finger at someone else during a time of crisis.\u201d</strong> The city\u2019s mayor said he had ordered the evacuation of officers from the 3rd precinct after reports of \u201cimminent threats to both officers and the public\u201d.</li> \n   <li><strong>The Minnesota National Guard </strong><strong>sent 500 soldiers to St Paul, Minneapolis and surrounding areas after the state\u2019s governor</strong><strong> declared a state of emergency. </strong>Governor Walz wrote in the proclamation that he supported peaceful protests but \u201cunfortunately, some individuals have engaged in unlawful and dangerous activity, including arson, rioting, looting, and damaging public and private property\u201d.</li> \n   <li><strong>The US attorney\u2019s office and the FBI in Minneapolis said earlier on Thursday they were conducting \u201ca robust criminal investigation\u201d</strong> into the death and making the case a priority. The FBI is also investigating, focusing on whether Floyd\u2019s civil rights were violated.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-29T07:01:07.860Z\">at 8.01am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed0b0908f0898700351e5e2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-29T06:50:08.046Z\">7.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Frey faced questions about the apparent absence of police and the National Guard on the city\u2019s streets. He was pointedly asked by one reporter: \u201cwho is in charge?\u201d. He directed questions about the role of police to the city\u2019s commissioner, but called the protests \u201cunacceptable\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Frey:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There is a lot of pain and anger right now in our city. I understand that, our entire city recognises that. What we have seen over the past several hours and past several nights in terms of looting is unacceptable. Our community cannot and will not tolerate it ... We are working with our officers right now of course, with resources provided by the state ... It was clear as of last night [that] we needed additional help and we got that, some form the state and we are expecting more as well.\u201d </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed0aee28f0898700351e5de\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-29T06:44:43.759Z\">7.44am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Frey, in that press conference just now, also addressed the decision to abandon the city\u2019s third precinct police station. He said he made the order for police to evacuate the building, which it appears has since been significantly damaged by fire, after reports of \u201cimminent threats to both officers and the public\u201d</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The symbolism of a building cannot outweigh the importance of the lives of our officers or the public.

Louisville, Kentucky, as protesters turned out to demand justice for <strong>Breonna Taylor</strong>, a black woman fatally shot by police in her home in March.</p> \n  <p>It comes amid demonstrations across the country following the death of a black man, <strong>George Floyd</strong>, in Minneapolis police custody.</p> \n  <p><strong>Louisville Metro Police</strong> confirmed in a statement early Friday that there were at least seven shooting victims, at least one of whom is in critical condition. The statement said there were some arrests, but police didn\u2019t provide a number. Police had initially confirmed reports of gunfire around 11:30 p.m.</p> \n  <p>Police spokesman Sgt. Lamont Washington told The Associated Press that all seven were civilians. Around 500 to 600 demonstrators marched through the Kentucky city\u2019s downtown streets on Thursday night, the Courier Journal reported. </p> \n  <p>Understandably, emotions are high, Louisville Mayor <strong>Greg Fischer</strong> tweeted just before midnight, sharing a Facebook post asking for peace that he said was written on behalf of Taylor\u2019s mother. </p> \n  <p>Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency medical tech, was shot eight times on March 13 after Louisville narcotics detectives knocked down the front door. No drugs were found in the home.</p> \n  <p>Attention on Taylor\u2019s death has intensified after her family sued the police department earlier this month. The case has attracted national headlines alongside the shooting of <strong>Ahmaud Arbery</strong> in a Georgia neighborhood in February. <br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed09c758f084e882655acf5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-29T05:24:53.075Z\">6.24am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>As the US grapples with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/george-floyd-minnesota-governor-national-guard-protests\">third night of protests</a> over the death of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis, here is what we know so far:</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/george-floyd-protests-what-we-know-so-far\">George Floyd protests: what we know so far</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed09aed8f087e3ca0f65835\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-29T05:22:38.991Z\">6.22am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"85e45214b5100392da2ba230044752fa9fa6a972\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85e45214b5100392da2ba230044752fa9fa6a972/0_182_4946_2967/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Unrest continues over the death of George Floyd\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Unrest continues over the death of George Floyd</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen Maturen/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aedf20a97152427c41e1f15d458c41885aa4cb1a\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aedf20a97152427c41e1f15d458c41885aa4cb1a/0_322_4895_2938/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters look at a burning liquor store across the street from the Minneapolis Police Department 3rd Precinct during protests over the arrest of George Floyd\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters look at a burning liquor store across the street from the Minneapolis Police Department 3rd Precinct during protests over the arrest of George Floyd</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tannen Maury/EPA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b4afc770b9a3c05f099855d9771caadf6eeaa455\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4afc770b9a3c05f099855d9771caadf6eeaa455/0_232_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters gather around after setting fire to the entrance of a police station as demonstrations continue in Minneapolis\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters gather around after setting fire to the entrance of a police station as demonstrations continue in Minneapolis</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlos Barr\u00eda/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed099698f084e882655acec\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-29T05:11:54.922Z\">6.11am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Minneapolis mayor <strong>Jacob Frey</strong>: \u201cWe all need to work together to ensure the safety of our friends, family, and Minneapolis residents.

  "<p>Unhinged as it may be for the president to accuse, without a scintilla of evidence, a morning television host of murder, that particular conspiracy theory was not the most disturbing accusation to issue from Trump\u2019s Twitter feed this week. No, that prize goes to his tweet from 26 May, claiming:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There is NO WAY (ZERO!) that Mail-In Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent. Mail boxes will be robbed, ballots will be forged &amp; even illegally printed out &amp; fraudulently signed \u2026 This will be a Rigged Election. No way!</p> </blockquote> <p>The president\u2019s defamation of Joe Scarborough is no more than an extreme version of something we have seen throughout Trump\u2019s tenure in office:&nbsp;his ability to deflect attention from one colossal misstep by simply committing a fresh outrage.&nbsp;The fact that even a handful of Republicans have expressed mild regret at Trump\u2019s bizarre accusation only underscores that it has served its instrumental purpose. For the moment, the news cycle is consumed not with the fact that 100,000 Americans have died in a pandemic that the White House recklessly insisted posed no threat; instead, all attention is riveted on the spectacle of a sitting president accusing an opponent in the \u201clame stream media\u201d of homicide.&nbsp;</p> <p>Trump\u2019s attack on mail-in ballots, by contrast, is far more ominous. Here, the president is defaming not an individual but the integrity of our electoral process, confidence in which is a key to a stable democratic order. And the purpose of this attack is not distraction but pointedly political. The politics of disenfranchisement has emerged as a staple of Republican electoral strategy, and the reasons for targeting mail-in ballots are not hard to divine. The bulk of such ballots are cast in urban areas, where Democratic voters predominate, and as the nation continues to grapple with the Covid-19 outbreak, we can expect millions of urban voters to cast mail-in ballots in November as a hedge against the obvious health risks that come with in-person voting. Trump\u2019s tweets serve, then, the politics of voter suppression.&nbsp;</p> <p>But that is only one aspect of the dark logic behind the tweets. Far more alarmingly, Trump\u2019s attack on the reliability of mail-in votes establishes the groundwork for a radical refusal to acknowledge electoral defeat. In contrast to ballots cast in-person on 3 November, mail-in ballots often cannot be fully counted until several days after the election. This means that in a very tight race, the results announced on election day may be no more than provisional; and second, because of the demographic patterns I mentioned above, the full counting of ballots may well swing the outcome in the favor of Democratic candidates.&nbsp;</p> <p>The 2018 Arizona senatorial race witnessed a particularly dramatic case of this effect, dubbed the \u201cblue shift\u201d by election law expert Ned Foley. On election day, Martha McSally, the Republican candidate, enjoyed a 15,000-vote lead over her Democratic rival, Kyrsten Sinema. By the time the state\u2019s canvassing had ended, however, McSally found herself defeated by Sinema by some 56,000 votes \u2013&nbsp;a swing of 71,000 thousand votes.&nbsp;</p> <p>Trump is more than familiar with the phenomenon of blue shift. Also in 2018, when the senatorial race in Florida saw Republican Rick Scott\u2019s lead over Bill Nelson shrink from over 56,000 on election day to an uncomfortable 10,000 by the time the state completed its canvass, Trump had urgently tweeted:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Florida Election should be called in favor of Rick Scott\u2026in that large numbers of ballots showed up from nowhere, and many ballots are missing or forged. An honest vote count is no longer possible\u2014ballots massively infected. Must go with Election Night!&nbsp;</p> </blockquote> <p>Recall that in 2016, Trump\u2019s margin of victory over Hillary Clinton was a <em>combined</em> 70,000 votes in the swing states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. It is more than possible that Trump could narrowly capture these states on 3 November, only to see his victory vanish as mail-in ballots are tallied in the days following the election. His tweet from Tuesday tells us how he would respond to such a loss. He will reject it as a product of fraud. That is an eventuality \u2013 or even a certainty \u2013 that the nation must prepare itself for.&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li><p>Lawrence Douglas is the author, most recently, of Will He Go?

However, I believe Joseph Lerner\u2019s 1950 Guilty Bystander is a true hidden gem, one lost in obscurity for many years due to the one unwatchable taped-from-TV copy floating around. There was no negative in existence, nor could we find any prints \u2013 until my restoration team located what may be the one remaining copy in the world at the British Film Institute, which graciously allowed us to restore this film and turn what had been blurry VHS rust into pure cinematic gold.

It is likely to face legal challenges.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/28/donald-trump-move-against-twitter-factchecking-could-backfire\">Donald Trump's move against Twitter factchecking could backfire</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As he prepared to sign the order, the president added: \u201cThey\u2019ve had unchecked power to censor, restrict, edit, shape, hide, alter virtually any form of communication between private citizens or large public audiences.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no precedent in American history for so small a number of corporations to control so large a sphere of human interaction.\u201d</p> <p>Twitter responded by calling the executive order a \u201creactionary and politicized approach to a landmark law\u201d .</p> <p>\u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Section230?src=hashtag_click\">#Section230</a> protects American innovation and freedom of expression, and it\u2019s underpinned by democratic values,\u201d the company <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Policy/status/1266170586197262337\">said in a tweet</a>. \u201cAttempts to unilaterally erode it threaten the future of online speech and internet freedoms.</p> <p>The move was welcomed by observers who argue that Facebook and Twitter should be held responsible for their content and subject to the same laws as the New York Times and other mainstream outlets.</p> <p>But many in the business and technology sectors argue the order could curb freedom of speech on the internet and it conflicts with existing law \u2013&nbsp;which only Congress, not the president \u2013 can change.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/trump-draft-order-could-expose-twitter-and-facebook-to-more-lawsuits\">Trump expected to sign executive order in bid to target Twitter and Facebook</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Matt Schruers, the president of the Computer and Communications Industry Association, told the Associated Press: \u201cThe irony that is lost here is that if these protections were to go away social media services would be far more aggressive in moderating content and terminating accounts. Our vibrant public sphere of discussion would devolve into nothing more than preapproved soundbites.\u201d</p> <p>Gary Shapiro, the president and chief executive of the Consumer Technology Association, said: \u201cWe oppose today\u2019s unconstitutional, ill-considered executive order. The free speech protections in Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act are the legal underpinning of our vibrant US online economy and our nation\u2019s global digital leadership.</p> <p>\u201cAmerica\u2019s internet companies lead the world and it is incredible that our own political leaders would seek to censor them for political purposes. These same politicians extensively advertise on them and just a few minutes online will reveal these platforms contain a multitude of political views.</p> <p>\u201cSection 230 protects these companies as well as any start-up website which hosts others\u2019 speech \u2013 from community bulletin boards to social media sites to the Fox News comments section.\u201d</p> <p>The US Chamber of Commerce said in a statement: \u201cWe believe that free speech and the right to engage in commerce are foundational to the American free enterprise system.</p> <p>\u201cRegardless of the circumstances that led up to this, this is not how public policy is made in the United States. An executive order cannot be properly used to change federal law.\u201d</p> <p>Many sceptics regard Trump\u2019s action as politically motivated ahead of the November election. He and other conservatives have long accused social media companies of liberal or pro-China bias, even as Twitter has this week allowed the president to tweet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/may/26/lori-klausutis-husband-asks-twitter-delete-trump-joe-scarborough-smears-death\">baseless conspiracy theories accusing a TV host of murder</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/may/26/lori-klausutis-husband-asks-twitter-delete-trump-joe-scarborough-smears-death\">Widower asks Twitter to delete Trump's 'horrifying' lies about wife's death</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ted Cruz, a Republican senator from Texas, said \u201cbig tech\u201d can no longer go unchecked. \u201cFor too long, social media platforms like Twitter have hid behind their opaque algorithms and Section 230 immunity to target speech with which they disagree and advance their own political agendas,\u201d he added.</p> <p>\u201cThis doesn\u2019t just stifle Americans\u2019 free speech; it shapes what Americans see, hear and ultimately think about the major issues facing our country, including how those issues should be addressed and who should be elected to address them.\u201d</p> <p>Brad Parscale, the Trump 2020 campaign manager, said on Thursday: \u201cSocial media has been allowed to operate unchecked for years while enjoying the protection of federal law.</p> <p>\u201cThese Silicon Valley giants have set themselves up as the arbiters of truth, censoring or labeling posts they disagree with, but they have shown that they cannot be trusted to be honest and fair. We have known for a long time that social media companies have it in for conservatives in general and President Trump specifically.\u201d</p> <p>But, critics say, after Twitter\u2019s intervention on Trump\u2019s false claims about mail-in voting, the company merely became the latest convenient punchbag for him to cultivate victimhood, rile up his base \u2013 and deflect attention from the coronavirus pandemic death toll.</p> <p>Ron Wyden, a Democratic senator from Oregon, warned: \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s order is plainly illegal. After driving our country into an economic and healthcare disaster, Trump is desperately trying to steal for himself the power of the courts and Congress to rewrite decades of settled law around Section 230. All for the ability to spread unfiltered lies.\u201d</p>"
