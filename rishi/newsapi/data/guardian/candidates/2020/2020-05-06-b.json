However, with 84% of today\u2019s 1,032 new cases and 67% of the national total located in the capital, the health minister <strong>Jaime Ma\u00f1alich</strong> has taken to referring ominously to the situation as the \u201cbattle for Santiago\u201d.</p> \n  <p>According to official statistics released by the health ministry, Chile had largely kept its epidemic under control. However, the country now has 23,048 confirmed cases and 281 people have died having tested positive.</p> \n  <p>Chile has maintained the highest level of testing in Latin America with more than 230,000 tests carried out. And the government has suggested an increase in testing could have contributed to the recent uptick in cases.</p> \n  <p>But the pandemic has also pushed out of the wealthier western suburbs of Santiago into more deprived, poorer-equipped areas of the capital. And the government has announced that 12 more districts will go into quarantine from Friday as part of its \u201cdynamic\u201d approach to enforcing and lifting lockdowns.</p> \n  <p>Checkpoints will also be set up around the nearby coastal cities of Vi\u00f1a del Mar and Valpara\u00edso \u2013 the country\u2019s second-largest population centre \u2013 where cases are currently far lower than in the capital.</p> \n  <p>Amid the rise in cases, the government has also softened its rhetoric with regard to a passport-style scheme that it had said would certify \u201cimmunity\u201d. A WHO directive has since urged caution regarding such policies.</p> \n  <p>Nonetheless, the government has said the first cards will be issued on Friday, although they will simply confirm that a person has tested positive for the virus, not that they are immune.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T18:49:32.198Z\">at 7.49pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb3011f8f08597eeb1b7403\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T18:42:03.149Z\">7.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Iceland has all but eliminated the virus as 97% of infected patients have recovered and only two new cases have been confirmed in the last week, the country\u2019s chief epidemiologist <strong>Thorolfur Gudnason</strong> has said.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We have been pleasantly surprised to see a very fast deceleration of the pandemic in Iceland.

That suggests that the virus was already being transmitted extensively around the globe from early on in the epidemic. </p> \n  <p>Balloux said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>All viruses naturally mutate. Mutations in themselves are not a bad thing and there is nothing to suggest SARS-CoV-2 is mutating faster or slower than expected.</p> \n   <p>So far we cannot say whether SARS-CoV-2 is becoming more or less lethal and contagious.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Balloux said the 198 small genetic changes, or mutations, that the study identified appeared to have independently occurred more than once. </p> \n  <p>These may hold clues to how the virus is adapting and help in efforts to develop drugs and vaccines. Ballouz explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>A major challenge to defeating viruses is that a vaccine or drug might no longer be effective if the virus has mutated. </p> \n   <p>If we focus our efforts on parts of the virus that are less likely to mutate, we have a better chance of developing drugs that will be effective in the long run.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The UCL team\u2019s findings, published on Wednesday in the journal Infection, Genetics and Evolution, confirm that the virus emerged in late 2019, Balloux said, before quickly spreading across the globe. </p> \n  <p>The study was not able to confirm the exact starting point or location. </p> \n  <p>A study by <strong>French scientists</strong> published earlier this week found <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/french-hospital-discovers-covid-19-case-december-retested\">a man there was infected with Covid-19 as early as 27 December</a>, nearly a month before France confirmed its first cases. <br></p> \n  <p> The <strong>World Health Organization</strong> said the French case was \u201cnot surprising\u201d and urged countries to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/who-seeks-early-coronavirus-cases-as-merkel-warns-over-german-lockdown\">investigate any other early suspicious cases</a>. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb2913a8f084fb5ab57d176\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T10:33:23.726Z\">11.33am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Twitter</strong> said it would tackle the spread of damaging conspiracy theories linking mobile phone technology and coronavirus with a prompt to direct people searching for 5G to British government-verified information. </p> \n  <p>The theory, which has spread on social media, has resulted in attacks on mobile telecoms masts and abuse directed at engineers in <strong>Britain</strong>. </p> \n  <p>Scientists, phone companies and the government have said it is completely untrue. </p> \n  <p>Twitter said the search prompt would inform users that the government had seen no link between 5G and Covid-19, and include a link to a government website with credible, factual and verified information in relation to 5G. </p> \n  <p>Katy Minshall, Twitter UK\u2019s head of government, public policy and philanthropy, said the move was the latest step in its focus on connecting people with authoritative information regarding Covid-19. </p> \n  <p>\u201cOur partnerships throughout this pandemic have allowed us to take proactive steps in bringing people the information most relevant and useful for them,\u201d she said. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e555962df387d1ecb97d8a5465f2d04a1df7d65c\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e555962df387d1ecb97d8a5465f2d04a1df7d65c/0_0_5568_3340/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A burned down mobile phone mast in London.

Also today, Nicola Sturgeon told Holyrood her government would start to lift restrictions \u201cas soon as possible\u201d, after the latest data showed coronavirus-related deaths in Scotland fell for the first time, and the Welsh government said it expected a \u201ccareful and cautious approach\u201d to relaxing the lockdown from Westminster.<strong> <br></strong></li> \n   <li><strong>Rishi Sunak is preparing to wind down the job retention scheme from July as the government plans to gradually remove lockdown measures.</strong> A decision is yet to be made, but the Treasury is understood to be examining several options for tapering the scheme, including cutting the 80% wage subsidy to 60% and lowering the \u00a32,500 cap on monthly payments. Another option promoted by employers\u2019 groups to allow furloughed staff to work, but with a smaller state subsidy, is also under consideration.</li> \n   <li><strong>The official UK coronavirus death toll passed 30,000 as another 649 fatalities were recorded.</strong> The new total of 30,076 represents the number of people who have tested positive for Covid-19 and died, so the true number will be much higher.</li> \n   <li><strong>Heathrow airport is to begin temperature screening of passengers in an effort to minimise transmission across borders.</strong> The airport\u2019s chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, said it would trial technologies and processes that could form the basis of a common international standard for health screening at airports, including cameras in immigration halls.</li> \n   <li><strong>No 10 scaled down the scope of the PM\u2019s new \u201c200,000 tests per day\u201d target as the government missed its 100,000 daily tests goal for a fourth day running.</strong> The PM\u2019s spokesman said that when Johnson set the new testing target for the end of May during PMQs, he had been referring to testing capacity.

Kandola said society had an opportunity to show zero tolerance towards racist behaviour once the lockdown is eased.</li> \n   <li><strong>The tube will only be able to run at 20% capacity to allow for physical distancing, Sadiq Khan said.</strong> The mayor of London said the transport system could not operate at pre-crisis levels while maintaining physical distancing at all times, so capacity would have to be reduced to 13-20% and the carrying capacity of double-decker buses could be reduced from 85 to 15 passengers. He argued that everyone in London who could work from home would have to continue to do so for the foreseeable future. </li> \n   <li><strong>And police decided not to take action against Prof Neil Ferguson after he breached lockdown rules.</strong> The scientist resigned last night after it emerged that he had broken lockdown restrictions by receiving visits from his lover. This morning the health secretary, Matt Hancock, said it was right that he had stepped down and backed any action the police decided to take. However, Scotland Yard said that since Ferguson had accepted responsibility for his error of judgment, no further action would be taken.

Some new research from the Centre for the Mathematical Modelling of Infectious Diseases (CMMID) at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine suggests that the figure may be much higher than people assume.</p> \n  <p>The researchers looked at data from the coronavirus outbreak on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, where eventually 80% of passengers and staff were tested. Combining this data with information with data about when people developed symptoms, and modelling showing how the virus would have spread, the team estimated that 72% of people on the ship infected with the virus remained asymptomatic.</p> \n  <p>The research has not been peer-reviewed, but there is a preliminary outline <a href=\"https://cmmid.github.io/topics/covid19/asymp-transmission.html\">here</a>, and a press release <a href=\"https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/newsevents/news/2020/almost-75-people-board-diamond-princess-covid-19-may-have-been-asymptomatic\">here</a>. Here\u2019s an extract.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The research team estimated that 72% of people infected with Covid-19 onboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship remained asymptomatic. For each asymptomatic case, it remained uncertain how infectious they were although they were unlikely to be as infectious as a symptomatic case.</p> \n   <p>Overall, the team estimate that asymptomatic cases were responsible for 11-84% of all infections during the outbreak. Work will be extended with more data (where available) and to other outbreaks, which the team hopes will enable more accurate estimates of the impact of asymptomatic cases on all infections over the coming period.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Rein Houben from the CMMID, who led the research, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We know that a substantial number of people infected with the coronavirus are asymptomatic, and there is anecdotal evidence that this group can transmit the virus, However, there are few reliable estimates on the proportion of people with Covid-19 who don\u2019t show symptoms, and their overall contribution to the spread of the virus.</p> \n   <p>This information is crucial for health policymakers to develop the most effective response strategies, including exiting from lockdowns.

Here are the main points.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The prime minister\u2019s spokesman signalled that cabinet and Cobra, the government\u2019s emergency committee, will meet at the weekend to agree the plan to start easing the lockdown</strong>. The cabinet will meet, as usual, tomorrow. But the spokesman also said that it was \u201centirely possible\u201d that cabinet would meet at the weekend. And he indicated that Cobra, the committee that includes representatives of the devolved administrations, would also meet shortly before the announcement gets made by Boris Johnson on Sunday. </li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman refused to comment on reports suggesting that the government may abandon its \u201cStay home\u201d slogan at the weekend, replacing it with another message consistent with the lockdown starting to ease.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said that, when Boris Johnson set a new testing target in the Commons of 200,000 tests by the end of May (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/may/06/uk-coronavirus-live-furlough-scheme-government-ease-lockdown-pmqs-covid-19-latest-updates?page=with:block-5eb29b558f084fb5ab57d22f#block-5eb29b558f084fb5ab57d22f\">12.12pm)</a>, the target applied to testing capacity</strong>.

But the spokesman said the actual target referred to by Johnson at PMQs this afternoon just covered capacity, not actual tests. In recent weeks daily capacity for testing almost always been significantly higher than the number of tests actually carried out. The spokesman said the target also covered antibody testing, which looks at whether people have had the virus, as well as the antigen testing, which looks at whether people have the virus. The current figures only cover antigen testing because a reliable antibody test for use at home is not yet available.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said Prof Neil Ferguson would no longer be advising the government in any way.</strong> But he said that others from Imperial College contribute to Sage, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies. The spokesman said that the government wanted Imperial\u2019s \u201cinvaluable work\u201d to continue to be available to it. The spokesman also said that Johnson thought Ferguson had taken the right decision to resign from Sage, and that the social distancing rules were there for a purpose.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman dismissed suggestions that Ferguson\u2019s resignation exposed double standards over the social distancing rules.</strong> There have been claims that Robert Jenrick, the housing secretary, and Johnson himself have both broken these rules, because <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/04/10/robert-jenrick-pressure-quit-claim-mansion-family-home-called/\">Jenrick left London with his family to stay in a home in the country</a>, and Johnson and his fiancee stayed at Chequers after Johnson come out of hospital. The spokesman said that Jenrick was just travelling to rejoin his family, and that Johnson went to Chequers on the advice of his doctors.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>The spokesman said that when Johnson spoke at PMQs about a a \u201cpalpable improvement\u201d in care homes, he was referring to death rates falling.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Jenrick, the housing secretary, will take this afternoon\u2019s press conference, the spokesman said.</strong> Prof Yvonne Doyle, the medical director of Public Health England, and Nikki Kanani, the medical director of NHS England, will also be appearing. The questions at the press conference are being allocated to regional newspapers, not national newspapers.

But, of course, there is no chance of PMQs resuming its shouting match status any time soon (one of the few benefits of this ghastly crisis) and instead Boris Johnson was left looking exposed and diminished as he faced Sir Keir Starmer for the first time.</p> \n  <p>As had been widely expected, Starmer was impressive \u2013 focused, calm, and rational. His interventions today were crisper than in his previous two outings (probably an improvement), and he always ended with a very direct question, simple yet incriminating. No doubt he could manage in a rowdy Commons, but the courtroom silence seems to suit him better, and the overall impression left by the encounter was of a rather floundering prime minister struggling to respond to a full-on grown-up channelling the questions a critical nation wants answering.</p> \n  <p>Another difficulty for the PM in Zoom PMQs is that he can\u2019t pick the brains of the specialist minister sitting alongside him. Prime ministers are normally more reliant on prompts from colleagues at PMQs than people realise, and Johnson looked particular in need of verbal assistance from Matt Hancock when asked about PPE.</p> \n  <p>In normal PMQs a struggling PM would resort to sloganising, and hope the backbench noise machine might do the rest, but with that no longer an option it did seem as if Johnson was more reliant on making points of substance. He could not answer Starmer\u2019s questions easily (they were designed to be hard to answer \u2013 at least, hard to answer without admitting gross negligence), but he did show some leg on a public inquiry, and provide a relatively revealing answer about why he is making the lockdown announcement on Sunday.</p> \n  <p>Starmer will be pleased with how the exchanges went. But if the new format militates against sloganising, then that is potentially a problem for the leader of the opposition too. At his first PMQs against Tony Blair, David Cameron came out with the memorable line about <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1504993/You-were-the-future-once.html\">how Blair \u201cwas the future once\u201d</a> \u2013 a soundbite and a slogan, but a good one, that defined Cameron successfully. A week today, we will remember that Starmer looked the part at his first PMQs, but we are less likely to remember what he actually said.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a7f096d5dac89cbce07220f508fc55079de8dfdd\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7f096d5dac89cbce07220f508fc55079de8dfdd/0_110_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson speaking at PMQs.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson speaking at PMQs.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Taylor/UK PARLIAMENT/EPA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T15:25:22.222Z\">at 4.25pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb2a8438f0898654cef9874\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T12:06:38.336Z\">1.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"54809a4eec44f2ab805f5141829adbb3098cc936\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/54809a4eec44f2ab805f5141829adbb3098cc936/0_0_3500_2313/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Larry the cat sits in front of 10 Downing Street.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"661\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Larry the cat sits in front of 10 Downing Street.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Henry Nicholls/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb2a69e8f0898654cef9856\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/severincarrell\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T12:00:50.043Z\">1.00pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The proportion of all Scottish coronavirus deaths happening in care homes rose to 59% last week, up from 52% the week before, adding to the sense of crisis in the sector.</p> \n  <p><strong> National Records of Scotland</strong>, the government agency, said that deaths overall from Covid-19 had declined week on week for the first time since the outbreak began, with 523 deaths relating to the virus recorded in the week ending 3 May (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/may/06/uk-coronavirus-live-furlough-scheme-government-ease-lockdown-pmqs-covid-19-latest-updates?page=with:block-5eb29d6e8f0898654cef97ad#block-5eb29d6e8f0898654cef97ad\">12.22.</a>).</p> \n  <p>That was a fall of 135 from the previous week, with the data including deaths in all settings, including hospitals, homes and other places.

And double decker buses could end up carrying just 15 passengers, he says.</p> \n  <p>Here is an extract.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It\u2019s an inescapable fact that no mass transport system of the scale we have in London can operate at full capacity while maintaining social distancing at all times. Even with Tube ridership standing at just five per cent at the moment, there are times when passengers struggle to keep their distance. </p> \n   <p>This means that if the social distancing requirements remain in place, the total carrying capacity of the Tube will have to be reduced to between 13 to 20 per cent of pre-crisis levels \u2013 even with close to 100 per cent of trains running. We will also need to have a fundamentally different approach to operating stations, with strict queuing systems to limit the number of people who can access the network at any one time. Certain major stations where TfL and National Rail services interchange are likely to present the biggest challenge.</p> \n   <p>Likewise, there will need to be big changes to how we run the bus network. The carrying capacity of double decker buses could be reduced from 85 passengers to just 15. During the lockdown, we have been encouraging social distance queuing at some of our 21,500 bus stops by putting markings on the pavement. But this system will not be possible to maintain when passenger numbers start to increase. We are looking at possible solutions and have already started working with London boroughs to widen pavement space in key locations to alleviate the pressure. However, it will still be impossible to maintain social distance if passenger numbers increase even modestly.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>One consequence of this, Khan argues, is that in London \u201ceveryone who can work from home will have to be told to continue to do so for the foreseeable future.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb293048f0898654cef96e8\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T10:42:27.872Z\">11.42am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Chinese in Britain 'too scared to venture out alone' amid rising levels of anti-Asian racism</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Rising levels of racist abuse that forced people of Chinese heritage to withdraw from UK society before the lockdown are likely to escalate when it lifts, an academic has warned.</p> \n  <p>Chinese people have been coughed at, attacked and told to \u201cgo back home\u201d, according to research led by Prof Binna Kandola.

Another family withdrew their four-year-old boy from a football club after other parents told their children not to stand close to him. One respondent told Kandola:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Nearly every British-born Chinese person I\u2019ve spoken to is genuinely very shocked about what has happened. They are British, have lived all their lives in Britain and yet they feel like outsiders now.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Prof Kandola said society has an opportunity to show zero tolerance towards racist behaviour when the UK eases lockdown measures. Condemnation from leading politicians and the media would help those affected feel like they are being listened to, he said, while also suggesting local authorities direct victims of abuse to helplines or support groups. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There\u2019s a role for all of us to keep our eyes and ears open about what is going on around us and, when we see it, to intervene.</p> \n   <p>We are actually better than this. As a nation we are better than this.</p> \n   <p>And there are a lot of people in this country who will be shocked about what is going on, and will do something about it.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T10:53:15.648Z\">at 11.53am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb2929a8f0898654cef96dd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T10:34:36.720Z\">11.34am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"edf44dd9c1828ed4ea750d32298f009b98d57048\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/edf44dd9c1828ed4ea750d32298f009b98d57048/0_155_4733_2839/1000.jpg\" alt=\"PPE supplies arrive at Bournemouth International Airport from Kuala Lumpur.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">PPE supplies arrive at Bournemouth international airport from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Finnbarr Webster/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T10:45:37.736Z\">at 11.45am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb287b98f082f9b4099b2b0\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T10:29:42.773Z\">11.29am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Hancock's Q&amp;A on Sky News - Summary</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here are some more lines from <strong>Matt Hancock</strong>\u2019s Q&amp;A on Sky News. I have already posted on what he said about Prof Neil Ferguson.

Asked about this data, Hancock said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think we\u2019ve got to be very cautious with these data. I think we\u2019ve got to be really careful in how we describe it, because you\u2019ve got to take a lot of things into account.</p> \n   <p>Firstly, we are one of the biggest countries in Europe and that matters, so there are smaller countries which naturally will have a lower death rate because they have got fewer people.</p> \n   <p>Spain and Italy, for instance, don\u2019t include deaths outside hospital in their figures. We didn\u2019t used to, because it is harder to count deaths in the community and in care homes, and we now do ...</p> \n   <p>If you talk to the statisticians and the chief medical officer, what they say is it\u2019s only afterwards, looking back and looking at the total number who have died during the peak, compared to the normal number - because you\u2019ve also got to take into account the age profile, factors like obesity.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>What Hancock is saying about Italy contracts what No 10 said <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/882243/2020-04-29_COVID-19_Press_Conference_Slides.pdf\">in a caption to one of the slides shown at the daily press conference on 29 April</a>.

That is right at the front of my mind.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He suggested that cafes may be able to open for customers sitting outside relatively soon.</strong> Asked by a viewer who wanted to know when their cafe could open, he replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The business secretary is working on the rules for safe working so, when we get the rate of new infections down, we can work on how people can get back to work as safely as possible. And we are going to say more about that very shortly.</p> \n   <p>There is strong evidence that outdoors the spread is much, much lower, so there may be workarounds that some businesses, for instance cafes, especially over the summer, may be able to put into place.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said it would too soon to say when schools would be allowed to open.</strong> Asked about this, he said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We don\u2019t know. We don\u2019t know because we have to see the progress of the disease and we don\u2019t know how people are going to behave in terms of the lockdown measures which are the thing that have the biggest impact on getting the disease down.</p> \n   <p>I understand the frustration of people wanting to know the answer \u2013 will it be June, will it be September, for what age groups? We just don\u2019t yet have the data but I think we are coming to a position relatively soon.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Hancock said the government could have explained the help available to care homes more effectively.</strong> Asked about problems with testing for people in care homes, Hancock said the government had to build the capacity for those tests to take place. Asked what he could have done differently, he said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think it\u2019s very hard. I feel like we\u2019ve put a huge amount of effort and resources behind supporting care homes from the start, maybe we should have explained that more clearly.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He claimed the UK was now a world leader on testing.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We invented the test in January. In February we got the number of tests up to 2,000 [a day]. In March we multiplied that by five times to 10,000. Then we set the 100,000 target.</p> \n   <p>The Germans started with this enormous diagnostics industry. But if you look at other countries around the world we are miles ahead on testing and we are now one of the world leaders.</p> \n   <p>It is true that Germany has a very high capacity \u2013 about the same as ours. So we have basically caught up with Germany that started with this massive capability. We are miles ahead of South Korea now.

Ian Hamilton, an expert in addiction and mental health from the University of York, who organised the letter, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It is encouraging to see the Department of Health recognise the need to provide flexible arrangements for the supply and use of controlled drugs during the Covid pandemic. This is long overdue as some of the regulations place onerous restrictions on health care staff and pharmacists who are already stretched.</p> \n   <p>The re-use of medicine like morphine is a sensible and pragmatic move which will not only be welcomed by health care workers but has the potential to ensure unnecessary suffering is avoided, as patients who are in pain or experience severe breathlessness can be treated in a timely and safe way. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The call comes after the home secretary Priti Patel <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/letter-to-the-acmd-on-advice-on-emergency-legislation-to-enable-supply-of-controlled-drugs/letter-from-the-home-secretary-to-the-chair-of-the-advisory-council-on-the-misuse-of-drugs\">wrote to the Advisory Council for the Misuse of Drugs saying</a>: \u201cI must be clear that these measures will not come into use with immediate effect.

And he started by escalating the criticism of Prof Neil Ferguson, suggesting there could be a case for the police getting involved.</p> \n  <p>Asked by the presenter <strong>Kay Burley</strong> if Ferguson should be prosecuted for breaking the lockdown rules, Hancock replied:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>You can imagine what my views are.</p> \n   <p>It\u2019s a matter for the police. As a government minister, I\u2019m not allowed to get involved in the operational decisions of police matters. But I think that the social distancing rules are very important and should be followed.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Burley said that Dr Catherine Calderwood, the Scottish chief medical officer who resigned after it emerged she had visited her second home, had been issued with a warning by the police. Asked if he approved of what the police did in that situation, Hancock said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Absolutely I back the police. I back the Scottish police, I would back the police here. They will take their decisions independently from ministers, that\u2019s quite right. It\u2019s always been like that.</p> \n   <p>And that\u2019s why, even though I\u2019ve got a view as to what I think, as a minister the way we run the police is that they make their decisions like this. So I give them their space to make that decision. But I think he took the right decision to resign.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Hancock also said he was speechless when he heard what Ferguson had done. In his statement to the Daily Telegraph, <a href=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/05/05/exclusive-government-scientist-neil-ferguson-resigns-breaking/\">which broke the story</a>, Ferguson justified his decision to meet a lover who lived in another household on the grounds that he was acting on the basis that he was immune, because he had had coronavirus. But Hancock said that he had also had coronavirus and that he has specifically asked the chief medical officer if that meant he was at lower risk. Hancock said he had been told he still had to observe the social distancing rules.</p> \n  <p>Hancock could easily have dodged Burley\u2019s questions about police involvement, but he chose to answer in a way that clearly implied this was a case where the police might want to get involved.</p> \n  <p>However, in doing so, Hancock also suggested he is not fully familiar with the regulations imposing the lockdown rules on England - the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) Regulations 2020, which Hancock himself introduced. These say that during the emergency period \u201cno person may leave the place where they are living without reasonable excuse\u201d.</p> \n  <p>But, according to the Telegraph story, Ferguson did not leave him house to see his lover. She came to visit him. There might be grounds for saying that she has broken the regulations, but not Ferguson.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"963772ac069d5ae89af0c53a00e3e2bd24561f6e\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/963772ac069d5ae89af0c53a00e3e2bd24561f6e/240_3_1487_892/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matt Hancock on Sky News with Kay Burley (left)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matt Hancock on Sky News with Kay Burley (left)</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: sky news</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T10:24:52.239Z\">at 11.24am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb27b6e8f085c470051f0da\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T09:05:05.916Z\">10.05am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Yesterday Downing Street told us that Boris Johnson has started taking a daily walk around St James\u2019s Park as part of his lockdown exercise regime.

A polarised politics has taken hold. It views the world through a prism of winners and losers and sees compromise and co-operation as signs of weakness. Lost is the idea that countries do better by working together to solve common problems, even if doing so sometimes means an apparent sacrifice of short-term benefit for the greater good. In its place is a cynical calculus: \u201cI\u2019m right and you\u2019re either with me or against me.\u201d This is the world that the pandemic hit.</p> \n   <p>A highly infectious novel virus, life-threatening for many, might seem to be just the sort of thing countries would want to work together on. Instead, it has been treated as a national issue for countries to deal with alone. Researchers and scientists may work together across the world but there is little evidence of politicians doing so ...</p> \n   <p>There remains no collective international view as to what works best in dealing with the virus \u2014 nor does there seem to have been any attempt to form one. This risks exacerbating the shift towards nationalism and absolutism which is emasculating the institutions that served us well over decades. A world in which a few \u201cstrong men\u201d square up to each other and expect everyone else to choose between them would be a dangerous one.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T08:20:16.148Z\">at 9.20am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb26c5f8f08da022712b4a6\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T07:53:12.222Z\">8.53am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Minister hints there will be inquiry into coronavirus, saying all governments will need to learn lessons</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>James Brokenshire</strong> has also been speaking on BBC Breakfast, and pushed on the <strong>UK\u2019s death toll</strong>, which is now the highest in Europe, Brokenshire said after the pandemic there will be a chance to see \u201cwhat mistakes have been made\u201d.</p> \n  <p>He told BBC Breakfast: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It is an absolute tragedy for anyone to lose a loved one. And there will be, I\u2019m sure, plenty of reflection and time once we are through this terrible virus to be able to look at actions that have been taken and to see what lessons can be learned, what mistakes have been made. And every government I think will need to do that and we are no exception to that.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The government has not yet confirmed that there will be a public inquiry into its handling of the coronavirus crisis once it is over, but Brokenshire\u2019s words may be the closest any minister has come to saying it\u2019s inevitable.</p> \n  <p>Asked the government\u2019s <strong>lockdown plans</strong>, Brokenshire said there is likely to be a \u201ccareful\u201d, \u201ccautious and thoughtful\u201d approach:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It does need to be done with that great care and thought, because the last thing that we need is another second surge, for the NHS to be overwhelmed and all of the issues that that would bring.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Pushed on <strong>testing</strong>, Brokenshire said the government decided to stop testing and tracing for coronavirus in the community on March 12 due to a \u201cshift\u201d in expert advice. He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We\u2019ve always been informed by the expert advice in this. There was a shift in terms of how testing was done - we\u2019ve already heard about some of the issues of overall capacity at that point of time and some of the evidence that (Sir) Patrick Vallance, our chief scientific officer (sic), has given.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Asked whether, had there been the capacity, track-and-tracing should have continued, the Home Office minister said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Would there have been benefit in having that extra capacity, as Patrick Vallance highlighted in his evidence yesterday? Yes.</p> \n   <p>The challenge that we had was that we have some fantastic laboratories, some fantastic expertise, but it has been the capacity restraints that we have had, and therefore that has posed challenges, but also that has now been ramped up to go from 2,000 tests (per day) in February to 120,000 at the end of April.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Reminder: this is what the UK\u2019s chief scientific adviser<strong> Sir Patrick Vallance</strong> told the Commons Health Select Committee yesterday:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> I think that probably we, in the early phases, and I\u2019ve said this before, I think if we\u2019d managed to ramp testing capacity quicker it would have been beneficial.</p> \n   <p>And, you know, for all sorts of reasons that didn\u2019t happen.</p> \n   <p>I think it\u2019s clear you need lots of testing for this [but] it\u2019s completely wrong to think of testing as the answer.</p> \n   <p>It\u2019s just part of the system that you need to get right. The entire system needs to work properly.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Brokenshire defended the decision <strong>not to close UK borders</strong> in a bid to stop the virus spreading across the country, after Vallance said most of the coronavirus strains being spread across the UK in March came from people returning from Spain and Italy. Brokenshire said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think it is important to note that the scientific advice was very clear that, up to this point in time, placing restrictions at the border would not have had any significant impact on epidemic progression in the UK. </p> \n   <p>Sage looked at this on March 23 - the numbers coming from other countries were estimated to be insignificant compared with domestic cases, comprising around 0.5% of total cases at the time.</p> \n   <p>Since then, obviously, you\u2019ll be more than aware, with all of the issues in the aviation sector, how we\u2019ve seen a reduction in air passengers by around 99% since the start of the outbreak.</p> \n   <p>It is something we will continue to keep under review as we look to the next phase but, at that time, the advice was clear that placing restrictions would not have had any significant impact.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"001a1982ed967b47e55d3e2c3ac4610ccc8fdfa6\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/001a1982ed967b47e55d3e2c3ac4610ccc8fdfa6/0_116_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James Brokenshire, the security minister.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Brokenshire, the security minister.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yui Mok/PA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T08:51:05.259Z\">at 9.51am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb26a948f085c470051f052\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T07:45:22.478Z\">8.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Prof Ferguson right to step down, says minister</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Security Minister <strong>James Brokenshire</strong> has called Prof Neil Ferguson\u2019s resignation a \u201cmatter of regret\u201d but an \u201cappropriate course\u201d of action.

He said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We are still very firmly discussing with the sector, with Public Health England and reaching out to ensure that capacity is reaching where it needs to be.</p> \n   <p>That work still continues. We are obviously concerned about issues in care homes, ensuring there is that reach - it is there in terms of the capacity, having gone up - and how we ensure we can get that further, where it is needed, given the whole point of investing in that was to ensure that it can give that sense of reassurance.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T08:44:12.819Z\">at 9.44am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb2662c8f085c470051f035\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T07:25:15.815Z\">8.25am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Will coronavirus spell the end of the party for Ibiza?</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/06/its-a-tough-island-to-live-on-why-coronavirus-spells-doom-for-ibiza\">'It's a tough island to live on': why coronavirus spells doom for Ibiza</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb263548f085c470051f02b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T07:14:36.202Z\">8.14am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>My colleague <strong>Steven Morris</strong> has this report on the name change of the <strong>national assembly of Wales</strong>:</p> \n  <p>There will be no fanfare and little ceremony but the body formerly known as the national assembly of Wales has a new name.</p> \n  <p>From now it will be known as Senedd Cymru \u2013 the Welsh parliament.

  "<p>On a sun-speckled, tree-lined street on a sunny Sunday afternoon, Ahmaud Arbery ran through his neighborhood in the coastal town of Brunswick, Georgia. Neighbors had seen him run by their homes every day for years.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/05/georgia-brunswick-shooting-ahmaud-arbery-grand-jury\">Georgia to consider charges in killing of unarmed black jogger as video emerges</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>One of them was Lauren Bennett, 26, who says running was what Arbery was known for around their Fancy Bluff neighborhood in Brunswick. Her security camera would ping into her phone as he raced by each day.</p> \n<p>\u201cYup, there goes Ahmaud,\u201d she told the Guardian, recalling his bouts of exercise. She\u2019d heard he used to wave to another neighbor on his daily runs.</p> \n<p>It should just have been another ordinary run for the 25-year-old Arbery back in February. But a series of events unfolded that ended in his brutal killing at the hands of two white men, which has caused anger across America and especially among black Americans and campaigners for social justice.</p> \n<p>Now, as Bennett watches the video of how his last run through her neighborhood ended in his death, she cries.</p> \n<p>That sorrow \u2013 and rage \u2013 has spread through Georgia and the rest of the US, and has reignited a long-running debate over the killings of young black men by white people. It was sparked by a 36-second video released online months after that late February run \u2013 a video that shed new light on how Arbery was killed. In the film, an unidentified person in a car films Arbery jogging towards a white truck parked on the road, where two men stand: one in the bed of the truck and another just to its side.</p> \n<p>One shot rings out as Arbery disappears off camera, swerving around the truck. Another shot rings out as Arbery struggles back into frame as yet another shot is heard. Finally, he falls to the ground.</p> \n<p>Before police made it to Arbery, he was already dead.</p> \n<p>According to a police report, the two men, Gregory McMichael, 64, and his son, Travis McMichael, 34, had grabbed their weapons, a .357 Magnum revolver and a shotgun, jumped into a truck and began following Arbery after seeing him run by.</p> \n<p>In the video, it appears Arbery is running in the moments leading up to his death.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ff982312-edb3-412b-afb8-5d08db8a14a9\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8EysSdqmQQI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The two men involved in the incident have not been charged or arrested over Arbery\u2019s death, but the case will now go to a grand jury following the release of the video and the condemnation that it produced, according to a statement from the district attorney in charge, Tom Durden.</p> \n<p>This month, the state chapter of the NAACP visited Arbery\u2019s family, calling for an end to race-based discrimination in Brunswick, a majority African American city. Tuesday evening, its local chapter<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4bkzjWrLAV0&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;fbclid=IwAR0__Izq6azDSEKizfDsFU2kQn2zwpGEi5g-Ret0Md1XRrAbj7_HR0UIdZc\"> called for swift action</a>, urging arrests to be made in the case and the immediate dismissal of the Glynn county police chief.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is murder,\u201d wrote Lee Merritt, a civil rights attorney who is representing Arbery\u2019s mother, in a statement posted to Facebook.</p> \n<p>Arbery\u2019s mother has been unable to watch the video that now has over 4 million views and has drawn condemnation from prominent figures across the country, including the former vice-president and 2020 Democratic candidate Joe Biden.</p> \n<p>The McMichaels, according to numerous reports, argue they were abiding by Georgia\u2019s stand-your-ground statute, a similar defense to that used by security guard George Zimmerman in the killing of black teenager Trayvon Martin in Florida.</p> \n<p>Arbery\u2019s death is one of dozens of killings of black boys and men across America, who have been shot in their communities often while engaging in everyday activities. Tamir Rice was killed at a playground in Ohio; Terence Crutcher slain while being pulled over by police; and Walter Scott shot dead in South Carolina after a traffic stop.</p> \n<p>L Chris Stewart, an Atlanta-based civil rights attorney who has represented a number of families like Arbery\u2019s, has a close relationship with the lawyer representing Arbery\u2019s mother. The two have spoken about what happened to Arbery. When Stewart first heard what happened, he thought to himself, \u201cI jog and I live in a predominantly white neighborhood now. And, you know, if someone suspects you\u2019re a criminal because you\u2019re black, then this is going to turn into the Wild Wild West.\u201d</p> \n<p>Glynn county, where Brunswick sits, has a history of controversy in its police departments. Last year, <a href=\"https://www.wtoc.com/2020/02/28/glynn-county-vidalia-police-chiefs-indicted/\">a former county police officer was indicted</a>. Initially, the prosecutors involved with the case chose not to press charges against the elder McMichael and his son. Documents and state records show the older McMichael is a <a href=\"https://law.georgia.gov/press-releases/2009-02-25/execution-date-set-man-convicted-glynn-county-murder\">former police detective</a> and <a href=\"https://thebrunswicknews.com/news/local_news/judge-signs-order-of-execution/article_5197ce3d-f667-5533-af39-665c715b6b98.html\">district attorney investigator</a> in Glynn county.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a really corrupt police department,\u201d Stewart said.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday night, more than two months after Arbery was shot in the middle of the street, the Georgia bureau of investigations announced the Glynn county police had not asked them to investigate the shooting, but rather, looked into threats against those involved in the investigation.</p> \n<p>The state\u2019s governor and attorney general spoke out after the video was released on Tuesday. \u201cI expect justice to be carried out as swiftly as possible,\u201d the attorney general, Chris Carr, said in a statement.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday evening, Bennett saw dozens of people coming to and from a protest in front of the McMichaels\u2019 home. On Wednesday, <a href=\"https://www.wsbtv.com/news/georgia/ahmaud-arbery-shooting-gbi-joins-investigation-video-surfaces-social-media/CCIAX3SWRVEDRI63SA5RDBZHVE/\">protest</a><a href=\"https://www.wsbtv.com/news/georgia/ahmaud-arbery-shooting-gbi-joins-investigation-video-surfaces-social-media/CCIAX3SWRVEDRI63SA5RDBZHVE/\">ers gathered</a> in Atlanta at the state capitol.</p> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on through the McMichaels\u2019 heads, and if they think the black community is shaken. But all races are hurt. We\u2019re all upset,\u201d Bennett said.</p> \n<p>But she was not surprised this happened in Brunswick \u2013 or anywhere in America.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s just racism, honestly. To me, it\u2019s never gonna die.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Guardian has published an edited version of the video after Benjamin Crump, an attorney for Arbery\u2019s father, said the family consented to its public dissemination.</p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 7 May 2020. Walter Scott was shot dead in South Carolina after a traffic stop, not shot dead in Louisiana leaving a convenience store as an earlier version said. An erroneous suggestion that four shots, rather than three, had been fired at Ahmaud Arbery was also corrected.</p>",
  "<h2>Trevor Noah</h2> <p>On the Daily Show, Trevor Noah examined the escalating \u201ccorona mask wars\u201d since the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html\">revised its guidelines</a> to encourage people to <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html\">wear a mask</a> in public. \u201cNow, this all seems reasonable enough, right? Everyone just needs to wear a mask when you\u2019re gonna be outside around other people,\u201d said Noah. \u201cBut apparently, it\u2019s the furthest thing from simple.\u201d Outlets across the country reported this weekend on people refusing to wear masks, in some cases <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/oklahoma-city-ends-face-mask-rule-shoppers-after-store-employees-n1198736\">threatening store employees</a> who attempted to enforce the order.</p> <p>\u201cWhy are people so angry?\u201d asked Noah. \u201cForget a vaccine, scientists need to start working on a chill pill. Health officials are asking for <em>us</em> to cover <em>our</em> faces to protect <em>ourselves,</em> and everyone is acting like they have to get spayed and neutered. And the people who don\u2019t wear masks are ruining it for everyone.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1257855285286371328\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Many Americans refuse to wear a mask because it makes it harder to breathe.

First, he conceded, they\u2019re not very comfortable. Which is why a woman in Kentucky <a href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/coronavirus/ny-coronavirus-20200504-qjpnujrrpzdtzlxlsavkfanjie-story.html\">went viral</a> for wearing a mask \u2026 with holes cut into it for her nose and mouth to make it \u201ceasier to breathe\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI think some people are missing the point of the mask: it\u2019s not about conforming, it\u2019s about safety,\u201d Noah explained. \u201cCan you imagine if people brought this attitude to sex? \u2018Don\u2019t worry, babe, of course I used a condom. I just ripped the top off because it was really uncomfortable for my penis and made it look like it was robbing a bank. But we\u2019re good! We\u2019re totally safe.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/may/05/seth-meyers-trump-what-you-get-when-you-make-tv-star-president\">Seth Meyers: 'This is what you get when you make a TV star president'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ultimately, Noah continued, the mask failure comes from the top: last week, Mike Pence <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/28/mike-pence-face-mask-mayo-clinic-visit-coronavirus\">refused to wear a mask at the Mayo Clinic</a> despite an explicit policy to do so, and this week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/06/trump-live-and-let-die-mask-factory-video\">Donald Trump visited a mask-making factory</a> barefaced. Both incidents have given license to people who have adopted not wearing a mask as a political position.</p> <p>\u201cLook, I don\u2019t even understand how a public health issue like wearing a mask became so politicized,\u201d Noah concluded. \u201cBut it is really weird to me that so many of these people who refuse to wear masks claim to be proud patriots who would do anything for their country. Because right now, America is at war with the coronavirus. And if you\u2019re going out in public without wearing a mask, well then, you\u2019re fighting for the other side.\u201d</p> <h2>Stephen Colbert</h2> <p>\u201cWhen Trump said as the weather gets warmer [coronavirus] would miraculously go away, I didn\u2019t know he meant our response,\u201d said Stephen Colbert on the Late Show about news that the White House is allegedly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/05/white-house-coronavirus-taskforce-winding-down-why\">winding down the coronavirus taskforce</a>, even as cases <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/04/us/coronavirus-live-updates.html\">are projected to rise in the US</a>.

Still, the taskforce\u2019s prognosis is murky, Colbert continued, because the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/05/us/coronavirus-live-news.html\">administration reportedly planned</a> the taskforce\u2019s \u201cgradual demise\u201d might \u201cnever be formally announced\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-tyYcfP8p0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/l-tyYcfP8p0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u201cSo \u2026 we might not ever really know what happened to the group that was supposed to let us know what was really happening?

But he\u2019s gonna want to make one small change,\u201d said Colbert over the photo of an amended banner: \u201cTransmission Accomplished.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt seems really doubtful that we can reopen the economy this soon and keep the disaster under control,\u201d Colbert continued. \u201cBut of course, anyone who\u2019s seen Donald Trump knows he always wants to have his cake and grope it too, because even though Trump made a big deal about releasing his own social distancing guidelines, he now <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-cheers-on-governors-as-they-ignore-white-house-coronovirus-guidelines-in-race-to-reopen/2020/05/04/bedc6116-8e18-11ea-a0bc-4e9ad4866d21_story.html\">shows no problem with states that ignore them</a>.\u201d</p> <p>Some, such as New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, have said the implicit question behind Trump\u2019s decision to dangerously relax physical distancing guidelines and shutdowns is \u201c<a href=\"https://abc7ny.com/coronavirus-new-york-ny-cases-in-news/6153317/\">how much is human life worth</a>?\u201d In a press conference, Cuomo criticized Trump\u2019s plan and asserted human life as \u201cpriceless\u201d.</p> <p>Cuomo\u2019s words, said Colbert, at least offered a \u201crefreshing contrast to Trump\u2019s position: a human life is worth about one trip to Buffalo Wild Wings\u201d.</p> <h2>Jimmy Kimmel</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QiUKCHTmSqA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QiUKCHTmSqA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel addressed a personal attack from Trump, who on Tuesday tweeted congratulations to Fox News host Greg Gutfeld for ratings which \u201cbeat no talent Stephen Colbert, nice guy Jimmy Fallon, and wacko \u2018last placer\u2019 Jimmy Kimmel\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI hope he wasn\u2019t talking about me!\u201d Kimmel deadpanned. \u201cI think this may be another typo situation.

  "<p>During a pandemic that has seen more than 70,000 deaths in the US (almost a quarter of the global amount), there is probably no worse song the president could walk out to than Live and Let Die, a cover by the rock band Guns N\u2019 Roses.

  "<p>He was once fearful of endangering the country\u2019s deep economic relationship with China, but the Australian prime minister, Scott Morrison, has now begun to campaign for an international inquiry into the Covid-19 outbreak.

And a US intelligence community <a href=\"https://www.odni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/item/2112-intelligence-community-statement-on-origins-of-covid-19\">statement</a> on the origins of Covid-19 was agnostic. Whether they can resist <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/30/us/politics/trump-administration-intelligence-coronavirus-china.html\">pressure</a> from the Trump administration to produce a politically convenient narrative, as reported in the New York Times, is an open question. But given that anti-Chinese sentiment so evidently plays into ramping election rhetoric in the US, a <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/24/gop-memo-anti-china-coronavirus-207244\">blame-shifting operation</a> seems to be under way.</p> <p>Even so, there is a good case for an inquiry. From the <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30382-2/fulltext\">shameful cover-up of the initial outbreak</a>, such as the silencing of the heroic doctor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/feb/07/coronavirus-chinese-rage-death-whistleblower-doctor-li-wenliang\">Li Wenliang</a>, to the subsequent censorship, the <a href=\"https://www.thestar.com.my/news/regional/2020/03/16/chinese-tycoon-ren-zhiqiang-goes-missing-after-criticising-beijings-response-to-coronavirus-outbreak\">disappearance of critics</a> and <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-health-coronavirus-eu-china/china-pressured-eu-to-drop-covid-disinformation-criticism-sources-idUKKCN22703A\">sowing of disinformation</a>, there\u2019s still a lot to learn. China has seen a litany of food and agriculture scandals (amazingly, it is still not well understood why <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/29/dead-pigs-china-water-supply\">16,000 pig carcasses</a> floated down the Huangpu river in 2013); its citizens certainly deserve to know more about the role of intensified animal agriculture and environmental destruction in propelling new pathogens into human population centres. Greater understanding may help societies across the world to better rebuild economies and improve public health and preparedness systems.</p> <p>But US and Australian demands get us no closer to solving these problems in China or anywhere else. International inquiries do happen (into Venezuela and Myanmar, <a href=\"http://libraryresources.unog.ch/factfinding/chronolist\">most recently</a>), but great powers don\u2019t play by the same rules as small countries. China will not accept being singled out by such an inquiry, any more than the US would have accepted a China-led inquiry into its role in sowing the 2008 global financial crisis. And even if it went ahead, China would likely give an inquiry the <a href=\"https://www.chathamhouse.org/expert/comment/two-years-south-china-sea-ruling-remains-battleground-rules-based-order\">same heed</a> it gave a critical 2016 UN ruling on the South China Sea, calling it \u201cnothing more than a piece of waste paper\u201d.</p> <p>Instead of spurring learning or action, this type of aggressive diplomacy will only lead to the further emboldening of hardline nationalist and protectionist narratives in Beijing, along with the escalating sabre-rattling that keeps us as far as ever from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/05/prevent-coronavirus-chernobyl-international-disaster\">the cooperation required </a>to handle the pandemic and its aftermath.</p> <p>Chinese elites may indeed be <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-sentiment-ex/exclusive-internal-chinese-report-warns-beijing-faces-tiananmen-like-global-backlash-over-virus-sources-idUSKBN22G19C\">fearful</a> of international pressure, with one intelligence-linked thinktank warning of the global fallout from anti-Chinese opprobrium. But punishing China will not improve international cooperation, any more than it will bring freedom of speech, encourage China to share information on future health crises, or improve supply-chain coordination on medical supplies.</p> <p>After the outbreak, China banned eating wildlife and stepped up efforts to disrupt the illegal wildlife trade. <a href=\"https://eia-international.org/blog/chinas-ban-on-eating-wildlife-is-good-but-its-messaging-between-the-lines-is-a-cause-for-concern/\">It can go much further</a>, and next year it will rightly be under scrutiny when it <a href=\"https://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/11873-Explainer-COP15-the-biggest-biodiversity-conference-in-a-decade\">hosts</a> the UN Convention on Biological Diversity talks in Kunming \u2013 this aims to reduce the destruction of ecosystems and biodiversity, which helps pathogens to pass between animals and people. In many other negotiations \u2013 such as the Paris climate agreement, and debt relief for the world\u2019s poorest \u2013 the sheer size of its economy means China plays a critical role.</p> <p>And while many Chinese citizens were initially furious about the government cover-up, there is also a widespread assumption in the country that \u201caccusations from western governments are in bad faith\u201d \u2013 as the academic Chenchen Zhang<em> </em><a href=\"https://madeinchinajournal.com/2020/05/04/covid-19-in-china-from-chernobyl-moment-to-impetus-for-nationalism/\">put it</a>. This has only grown in recent weeks,<em> </em>especially since these same \u201cinternational actors were silent\u201d about China\u2019s plight in late January and early February.</p> <p>Carlson may dislike Americans \u201csquabbling about lockdowns\u201d, but criticising one\u2019s government\u2019s response is the right of citizens in open societies. Of course, the Chinese government will silence its critics and engage in blame-shifting rhetoric. It took <a href=\"https://hongkongfp.com/2020/03/07/china-censors-report-authorities-hid-coronavirus-genome-sequence-test-results-14-days/\">brave, independent journalists</a> in China to break the story of the Covid-19 cover-up, despite fears of reprisals, and pressure from the authorities to spread \u201c<a href=\"https://qz.com/1798070/china-seeks-to-create-positive-media-coverage-about-coronavirus/\">positive energy</a>\u201d that hews to the official government line.</p> <p>But in countries like the US, Australia and the UK, citizens have a choice. We can scrutinise our governments and societies \u2013 for the glaring failures of the pandemic response; the debasement of scientific inquiry and media freedom; the politicisation of intelligence; <a href=\"https://jewishcurrents.org/a-new-cold-war-threatens-chinese-americans/\">attacks</a> on the \u201cdual loyalties\u201d of ethnic Chinese \u2013 or we can fall into line, direct our ire at the foreign enemy, and jettison the possibility of progress into the grinding gears of a great power conflict.</p> <p>\u2022 Sam Geall is executive director at China Dialogue and associate fellow at Chatham House, a thinktank in London</p>",
  "<p>A prosecutor in Georgia said he would ask a grand jury to decide if charges should be filed against a white former law enforcement officer and his son over the fatal shooting of an unarmed young black man as he ran through a small town.</p> \n<p>The shooting of 25-year-old Ahmaud Arbery outside Brunswick, Georgia, in February was captured on videotape and posted on social media on Tuesday, stirring outrage over the reluctance of prosecutors to file charges against Gregory McMichael and his son, Travis. </p> \n<p>The video footage, which was taken by an unidentified witness in another car, shows Arbery jogging down a narrow two-lane road and around a white pickup truck stopped in the right lane, its driver\u2019s door open.</p> \n<p>As Arbery crosses back in front of the truck a gunshot is fired. Arbery is then seen struggling with a man holding a long gun as a second man stands in the bed of the truck brandishing a revolver. Two more shots are heard before Arbery stumbles and falls face-down on to the asphalt.</p> \n<p>The graphic footage has prompted an outcry and demands for justice; the activist Shaun King posted the video on Twitter, describing it as \u201cone of the worst things I\u2019ve seen in my entire life\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ff982312-edb3-412b-afb8-5d08db8a14a9\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8EysSdqmQQI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p> Tom Durden, the acting district attorney for a neighboring district, said in a letter posted on Facebook that he believed \u201cthe case should be presented to the grand jury of Glynn county for consideration of criminal charges against those involved in the death of Mr Arbery\u201d.</p> \n<p>Durden, who was assigned to investigate the fatal shooting after prosecutors in Brunswick and a neighboring district recused themselves due to potential conflicts of interest, said he would present the case to the next available grand jury in Glynn county. That grand jury might not meet until mid-June or later because courts were under restrictions imposed by the coronavirus pandemic, he said.</p> \n<p>According to a police report obtained by the New York Times, Gregory McMichael, a former police officer and district attorney\u2019s investigator, told investigators the incident began when he spotted Arbery from his front yard \u201chauling ass\u201d down the street.</p> \n<p>McMichael told police that, because he suspected Arbery in a string of recent neighborhood break-ins, he summoned his son and the two men gave chase in the truck, Gregory McMichael carrying a .357 Magnum revolver and Travis armed with a shotgun.</p> \n<p>Gregory McMichael said Arbery began to \u201cviolently attack\u201d his son and fought over the shotgun, prompting Travis to open fire. It is not clear from the police report or the videotape if Gregory McMichael also fired on Arbery.</p> \n<p>But it appears from the video footage that by the time the clearly unarmed Arbery is tussling with Travis McMichael, who is holding the long gun, a shot has already been fired.</p> \n<p>The Democratic presidential candidate and presumptive nominee Joe Biden tweeted that it was clear Arbery was killed \u201cin cold blood\u201d and called for a full murder investigation.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1257876833581912065\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The video is clear: Ahmaud Arbery was killed in cold blood.

  "<p>Donald Trump has been accused of personally causing the deaths of 40,000 Americans through his \u201creckless\u201d handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, in a new website launched on Wednesday under the provocative title Trump Death Clock.</p> <p><a href=\"https://trumpdeathclock.com/\">The website</a>, created by independent film-maker Eugene Jarecki, is a conscious echo of the <a href=\"https://www.usdebtclock.org/\">National Debt Clock</a> which since 1989 has given a running score near Times Square in Manhattan of total US borrowing. The Trump Death Clock extends the idea dramatically by providing a tracker measured not in dollars but in lives allegedly lost by the president\u2019s own inept actions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/05/trump-coronavirus-taskforce-pence-us-death-toll\">Trump poised to wind down Covid-19 taskforce as US death toll tops 70,000</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI am seeking accountability for reckless leadership,\u201d Jarecki told the Guardian. \u201cWe have meticulously isolated just that portion of the US death toll where one can see a specific line between the president\u2019s decisions and actions and the loss of life.\u201d</p> <p>The Trump Death Clock provides a bald tally of lives that it claims were needlessly lost to Covid-19 that ticks upwards in real time. At the time of reporting this article, it stood at 39,435 \u2013 laying responsibility for almost 40,000 American lives at the White House door.</p> <p>The figure is in turn based upon the authoritative running tally of total deaths from Covid-19 compiled by the <a href=\"https://covidtracking.com/data/us-daily\">Covid Tracking Project</a>. From its daily read-out of coronavirus fatalities, Jarecki\u2019s team has created the Trump Death Clock through a simple mathematical calculation of 60% of total deaths from the disease in the US.</p> <p>The 60% ratio used in the death clock was drawn from a study by two prominent epidemiologists, Britta Jewell of Imperial College, London, and Nicholas Jewell, a professor of biostatistics at UC Berkeley. Writing in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/14/opinion/covid-social-distancing.html\">the New York Times</a> in April, they posited the theory that if Trump had introduced the White House social distancing guidelines not on 16 March but a week earlier on 9 March, a 60% reduction in the expected final death count could have resulted given the exponential spread of the virus.</p> <p>That formula runs the risk of coming across as reductionist and motivated by political animus. But Jarecki, whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/07/out-of-prison-after-23-years-thanks-to-his-mother-and-a-documentary\">previous work</a> in movies has focused on abuses in public life, insists that his clock is founded upon the credible scientific thinking of top public health experts and epidemiologists, and that it is conservative in its estimations.</p> <p>\u201cI believe we need a national measure of the cost of the recklessness of the president\u2019s pandemic response,\u201d Jarecki said. \u201cHe was advised multiple times by the intelligence services and his own public health experts of the significance of this pandemic and the need to take mitigating action, and yet those warnings were not acted upon.\u201d</p> <p>Even Dr Anthony Fauci, the leading infectious disease expert in the US who has been central to the federal Covid-19 response, has publicly noted the cost in American lives of failing to lock down early on. \u201cIf you had a process that was ongoing and you started mitigation earlier, you could have saved lives,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/12/politics/anthony-fauci-pushback-coronavirus-measures-cnntv/index.html\">he told CNN</a>.</p> <p>Jarecki is already thinking about giving physical form to his Trump Death Clock following the example of the National Debt Clock. He told the Guardian that as he was developing his idea, associates encouraged him to create an actual physical tracker that might be placed in full public view in New York and other large cities across the country.</p> <p>Trump has responded to criticism of his handling of the pandemic with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2020/mar/20/sensationalism-trump-lashes-out-at-journalist-during-coronavirus-briefing-video\">volatility</a> in the past. He has accused several reporters of being \u201cnasty\u201d and of peddling \u201cfake news\u201d after they questioned him during his daily White House coronavirus briefings.</p> <p>Asked whether he was anxious about how Trump might respond to being directly accused of causing tens of thousands of deaths, Jarecki replied: \u201cI can\u2019t think about that. I feel I owe it to people who lost their lives to demand accountability and more responsible leadership going forward so that they did not die in vain.\u201d</p>",

This will be the first formal preselection conducted through a plebiscite under democratic reform rules in NSW, something which I and many others fought for over many years. </p> \n   <p>My decision was also strongly influenced by the fact that I must have surgery on a condition I have been putting off for the last year because of politics. I cannot put surgery off any longer and I will enter hospital tomorrow and expect a full recovery. </p> \n   <p>The Morrison government has led us brilliantly through Covid-19 crisis, and as a proud resident of Eden-Monaro, I shall join my fellow Liberals in campaigning fiercely for our endorsed candidate to join the prime minister\u2019s team as he guides Australia back to a secure, safe and prosperous post-Covid-19 existence. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T07:22:37.091Z\">at 8.22am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb229398f085c470051ef28\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/naaman-zhou\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T03:05:33.232Z\">4.05am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A paramedic who took a sick passenger off the Ruby Princess wrote that the patient was \u201csuspected [of] Covid\u201d, a special inquiry has heard.</p> \n  <p>Earlier today, the ship\u2019s port agent, <strong>Dobrila Tokovic</strong>, said ambulances had not been called for respiratory issues but because the patients had \u201cother conditions\u201d affecting their hearts and nerves. </p> \n  <p>But she said the ship\u2019s doctor had told her to let paramedics know the passengers had been swabbed for Covid-19 and they should wear protective equipment. </p> \n  <p><strong>Simeon Pridmore</strong>, a trainee paramedic who transported one passenger, told the inquiry that his case description on the day had said: \u201cOn board testing showed negative for influenza and suspected Covid.\u201d</p> \n  <p>He said his case description was \u201can amalgamation of both a doctor\u2019s report \u2013 I received a verbal handover and a written handover \u2013 as well as info provided by the patient\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Earlier, Tokovic told the inquiry that sick passengers were usually sent to St Vincent\u2019s hospital, but that these two were had been to Royal Prince Alfred hospital. </p> \n  <p>Counsel assisting, <strong>Richard Beasley </strong>SC, asked if this was because Royal Prince Alfred was \u201callocated as a \u2018Covid response hospital\u2019\u201d and Tokovic said she did not recall. </p> \n  <p>Pridmore later told the inquiry that he had been taken \u201cdirectly to a Covid-designated area\u201d when his ambulance arrived at Royal Prince Alfred.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T07:21:30.268Z\">at 8.21am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb227878f08da022712b36f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T03:01:26.719Z\">4.01am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Walkley Foundation may as well hand over the award for headline of the year now, we\u2019ve just flushed the competition (sorry). </p> \n  <p>Trust Sydney\u2019s rental market to have already developed a vaccine for Covid-19. </p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/06/toilet-kitchen-sydney-studio-apartment-rent-surry-hills-australia\">Room with a poo: the tiny Sydney apartment for rent with a toilet in the kitchen</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb226268f085c470051ef1a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-06T02:56:04.440Z\">3.56am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here\u2019s something I missed from that earlier interview of <strong>Scott Morrison </strong>by<strong> </strong><strong>Ray Hadley</strong>.

  "<p>It is 2040. Coronavirus is a distant memory. Boris Johnson has fathered his 19th child. Toy Story 12 and Fast &amp; Furious 32 are playing in cinemas. Donald Trump is a cuddly nonagenarian who is cooed over by liberals. \u201cRemember the good old days when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/25/donald-trump-coronavirus-disinfectant-sarcastic-tipping-point\">Donny joked about injecting bleach</a>?\u201d people will reminisce fondly. \u201cWhat a legend!\u201d</p> <p>Does that last prediction sound improbable? It shouldn\u2019t: just look at the ongoing rehabilitation of George W Bush. It is only 11 years since Bush left office, but widespread amnesia regarding his regressive record appears to have set in. People have already giggled over <a href=\"https://uk.style.yahoo.com/george-w-bush-fighting-rain-194703735.html\">his adorable struggle to put on a </a><a href=\"https://uk.style.yahoo.com/george-w-bush-fighting-rain-194703735.html\">poncho</a> during Trump\u2019s inauguration and praised <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/oct/08/ellen-degeneres-george-w-bush-lgbt\">his unlikely friendship with Ellen DeGeneres</a>. Now many liberals are fawning over Bush for the incredible achievement of being an iota more sane than Trump.</p> <p>On Saturday, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheBushCenter/status/1256607729151619073?s=20\">Bush put out a video</a> calling for compassion and national unity during the coronavirus crisis. In it, he declared: \u201cWe are not partisan combatants; we are human beings.\u201d This is a lovely message; really, it is. It is just a shame he wasn\u2019t so invested in our shared humanity when he used the fabricated threat of weapons of mass destruction to bomb Iraq into oblivion. It is a pity he didn\u2019t think about \u201chow small our differences are\u201d when he fought LGBTQ+ rights. It is unfortunate he wasn\u2019t so concerned about compassion during <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2017/sep/08/us-presidents-and-how-to-deal-with-hurricanes-video-explainer\">his botched and heartless response to Hurricane Katrina</a>.</p> <p>If there were an Oscar for best use of cinematography to whitewash a bloody legacy, then Dubya has certainly earned it. His three-minute message \u2013 which was part of <a href=\"https://unite.us/\">The Call to Unite</a>, a project featuring videos from celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey and Julia Roberts \u2013 has been viewed more than 6m times and generated widespread praise. With Trump in office, suddenly Bush <a href=\"https://theweek.com/articles/912481/how-george-w-bush-exposed-trumps-biggest-failure\">doesn\u2019t seem so bad</a> to many observers. At least Bush could reach across the political aisle now and again. \u201cBush handled post-Katrina by asking his father and Bill Clinton to help,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/maggieNYT/status/1256780608015138819?s=20\">tweeted Maggie Haberman</a>, the New York Times\u2019 White House correspondent. \u201cThe current president has been uninterested in asking his predecessors to get involved as the country deals with Covid.\u201d</p> <p>We don\u2019t have to do this. We don\u2019t have to normalise Bush or rewrite his record just because Trump is unleashing his own campaign of shock and awfulness. We don\u2019t have to minimise the enormous damage Bush did just because he didn\u2019t tweet misspelled abuse at his political enemies. We don\u2019t have to do any of this \u2013 but a lot of Americans seem desperately to want to. This is partly because the US has a deep-seated reverence for its heads of state, as illustrated by the fact <a href=\"https://bigthink.com/politics-current-affairs/honorific-president-impeach\">they retain the honorific of </a><a href=\"https://bigthink.com/politics-current-affairs/honorific-president-impeach\">president</a> after they have left office. Perhaps because Britain is a monarchy with a longer history than the US, we don\u2019t see our head of government as a national mother or father figure in quite the same way.</p> <p>However, the bigger motivation behind the apparent desire to rehabilitate Bush is probably a desperation among liberals to see Trump as an anomaly who doesn\u2019t reflect the \u201creal\u201d US. But Trump is not an aberration. He didn\u2019t emerge from a vacuum. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/20/george-w-bush-donald-trump-speech-blood-hands\">The lies, </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/20/george-w-bush-donald-trump-speech-blood-hands\">jingoism and anti-intellectualism of the Bush era helped pave the way for him</a> \u2013 and the steady rehabilitation of Bush is paving the way for Trump to evade accountability in the future.</p> <p>You don\u2019t move forward by forgetting and forgiving the past; you move forward by learning from it. It seems we haven\u2019t learned anything. Nevertheless, my greatest respect goes out to Bush\u2019s PR people for their incredible work transforming him into a national treasure.

  "<p>One of the most obvious problems with parking yourself in a chair next to a colossal statue of Abraham Lincoln is that you look so very small.</p> <p>Not one of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/30/brad-parscale-trump-social-media-rasputin-campaign-manager\">political</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/13/opinions/hope-hicks-white-house-return-hossain/index.html\">communications</a> brains behind Donald Trump bothered to point this out when they dreamt up the dingbat notion of a live TV interview inside the hallowed Lincoln Memorial.</p> <p>Nobody thought it was anything other than genius to compare the two presidents. One of them saved the Union and created the model for the muscular federal government we know today; the other got impeached for corrupting that government for his personal profit.</p> <p>One gave his life to unite the country and free it from slavery. The other wants tens of thousands of Americans to give up their lives to free the country from lockdown.</p> <p>One was known as Honest Abe. The other <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-cohen/fbi-documents-point-to-trump-role-in-hush-money-for-porn-star-daniels-idUSKCN1UD18D\">lied</a> about paying off porn stars with hush money. You can see how they confused the two.</p> <p>To be fair, presidents in times of crisis often reach for the same analogy. It calms them in their hour of need to think that Lincoln was also misunderstood as he stood alone in the maelstrom of history.</p> <p>George W Bush <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/15/us/politics/abraham-lincoln-the-one-president-all-of-them-want-to-be-more-like.html\">supposedly</a> read 14 Lincoln biographies while in office as he grappled with his disastrous war in Iraq. Barack Obama all but wore a stovepipe hat as he quoted <a href=\"https://time.com/4178331/state-union-barack-obama-abraham-lincoln/\">liberally</a> from the Great Emancipator in a career of speeches ranging from his campaign announcement to his presidential inauguration to his final State of the Union.</p> <p>To be less fair, Donald Trump somehow missed the entire point of Lincoln while sitting inside a secular temple to one of the greatest presidents of them all.</p> <p>When asked by a fan if he couldn\u2019t tone down his bullying \u2013 if only to help the world understand what a great leader he is \u2013 Trump sailed on by like a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/28/world/asteroid-earth-flyby-1998-or2-scn-trnd/index.html\">giant</a> asteroid spinning on its thoughtless journey through the galaxy.</p> <p>\u201cI am greeted with a hostile press the likes of which no president has ever seen,\u201d said the gas-filled lump of rock. \u201cThe closest would be that gentleman right up there. They always said Lincoln \u2013 nobody got treated worse than Lincoln. I believe I am treated worse.\u201d Frankly Lincoln had it easy. Apart from that night at the theater, and that blood-drenched civil war. Not like the Trump presidency, where every hour brings another nasty word or two from a talking head on cable news.</p> <p>Sitting at the feet of Honest Abe, Trump naturally lied about why he was even there. \u201cYou know, I didn\u2019t know that it was creating criticism,\u201d he innocently explained to his softball interviewers at Fox News. \u201cBut I thought it was your choice, not ours.\u201d</p> <p>This must have been news to Fox News, whose executives <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/04/us/politics/trump-lincoln-memorial.html\">confirmed</a> that it was the Trump White House that wanted him to be seated inside the Lincoln Memorial. In fact, they wanted it so badly they changed the federal rules to allow Trump to speak inside the inner sanctum.</p> <p>Their official reason? It\u2019s the pandemic, stupid: \u201cGiven the extraordinary crisis that the American people have endured, and the need for the president to exercise a core governmental function to address the nation about an ongoing public health crisis,\u201d explained Trump\u2019s interior secretary, David Bernhardt.</p> <p>As it happens, the American people have endured only the start of this extraordinary crisis. If this president could exercise any core governmental function \u2013 or any core brain function \u2013 America\u2019s ongoing public health crisis would look far less deadly.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The total American death toll is likely to be around 134,000 by early August \u2013 but could also reach double that figure</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Instead, Trump\u2019s own experts \u2013 if that\u2019s not a political paradox \u2013 are predicting 3,000 deaths a day by early June. According to a CDC document <a href=\"https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/6926-mayhhsbriefing/af7319f4a55fd0ce5dc9/optimized/full.pdf#page=1\">leaked</a> to the New York Times, instead of flattening the curve, America is building a Trump Tower of new infections over the next month.</p> <p>Those stunning numbers are in fact the middle range of the new projections, which could be as high as 10,000 deaths a day. Independent modeling by the University of Washington\u2019s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation <a href=\"https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america\">suggest</a> the total American death toll is likely to be around 134,000 by early August \u2013 but could also reach double that figure.</p> <p>Since we\u2019re indulging in historical comparisons, that\u2019s more than the number of Union <a href=\"https://ehistory.osu.edu/exhibitions/cwsurgeon/cwsurgeon/statistics\">soldiers</a> Lincoln lost in combat. It\u2019s more than America lost in the first world war. It\u2019s the equivalent of a 9/11 massacre every day, just one month from now.</p> <p>Why are the numbers rising so sharply? Not, as Trump likes to claim, because of China. Not because the experts are too pessimistic with their public health models. But because so many governors are following Trump\u2019s toxic mix of arrogance and ignorance to relax their own lockdowns. This is a deadly pattern of dunce-like leadership. Instead of suppressing coronavirus spread in January and February, Trump obsessed about his own job survival. Instead of surging medical supplies in March, Trump <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/how-trump-shifted-his-tone-on-coronavirus-134246\">claimed</a> he was doing a great job on this whole pandemic thing. Instead of figuring out contact tracing in April, he <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/01/politics/donald-trump-michigan-gretchen-whitmer-protests/index.html\">encouraged</a> armed protesters to pressure for an end to lockdown. Trump has brought a whole new meaning to the concept of killing time.</p> <p>Soon the rock-solid Trump voters in previously Republican states will understand the true cost of Trump\u2019s leadership. Trump\u2019s partisan blame game will fall apart before Memorial Day. The most recent <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/texas/\">polling</a> in Texas suggests Trump is now tied with Joe Biden in a state he won by nine points in 2016.</p> <p>These are the kind of numbers \u2013 not the death toll \u2013 that keep Trump up at night. It was past one in the morning on Tuesday, when Dishonest Don rage-tweeted against a group of former Republican operatives who call themselves the Lincoln Project.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re all LOSERS, but Abe Lincoln, Republican is all smiles,\u201d our Lincoln expert <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1257532114666508291\">tweeted</a>, in a rhetorical flourish that evoked Gettysburg.</p> <p>What peeved the great insomniac in the executive mansion where Lincoln once slept? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/28/lincoln-project-donald-trump-cooper-union-rick-wilson\">The Lincoln Project</a> crossed a bright red line by remaking the epic 1984 re-election ad about how Reagan had made America great again.</p> <p>Like most Trumpian tales, it is a parody of the presidency. It tells the story of lives lost \u201cfrom a virus Donald Trump ignored\u201d and the economic decimation that followed. It tells the story of an American sunset, not a sunrise.</p> <p>They <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_yG_-K2MDo\">called</a> it, naturally, Mourning in America. But if the projections are correct, this nation\u2019s mourning is only just beginning.</p>",
  "<p>A federal judge has reinstated New York\u2019s June Democratic presidential primary, siding with Andrew Yang, the former candidate, who sued the state in federal court and <a href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.536316/gov.uscourts.nysd.536316.16.0.pdf\">called</a> the recent decision to cancel the contest \u201cauthoritarian and illegal\u201d.</p> <p>The judge ruled Tuesday that the state had wrongfully removed the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, Yang and eight other former presidential candidates from the ballot.</p> <p>The decision came after two Democrats on the state\u2019s election commission cancelled the presidential primary <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/04/27/846549412/new-york-cancels-primary-election-angering-sanders-supporters\">last week</a>, relying on a new budget provision allowing them to remove presidential candidates who suspended their campaigns. The move outraged Sanders supporters and other progressives who said New York, a Democratic bastion, was actively disenfranchising voters.</p> <p>\u201cIt goes against what the party stands for,\u201d said Heather Key, who volunteered for the Sanders campaign. \u201cThey\u2019re always on the case about gerrymandering and cheating with the GOP. And yet here they are controlling whether we can vote for the president of our choosing.\u201d</p> <p>The US district judge Analisa Torres wrote that the state had deprived voters of their constitutional guarantee of freedom of association. New York voters, she said, weren\u2019t just voting for a presidential candidate, but also for delegates who could influence the direction of the Democratic National Convention in August. (Sanders and Biden announced an agreement <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/biden-camp-agrees-let-sanders-keep-lost-convention-delegates-n1196631\">last month</a> to let Sanders keep hundreds of delegates, and make sure the senator is represented at the Democratic national convention.)</p> <p>\u201cThe removal of presidential contenders from the primary ballot not only deprived those candidates of the chance to garner votes for the Democratic party\u2019s nomination \u2026 it deprived Democratic voters of the opportunity to elect delegates who could push their point of view in that forum.\u201d</p> <p>Election officials had argued that holding a largely symbolic presidential primary would be costly and put people\u2019s health at risk during the coronavirus pandemic. In <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/52-worked-voted-wisconsin-election-covid-19-70406317\">Wisconsin</a> and <a href=\"https://www.news4jax.com/news/local/2020/03/30/duval-county-poll-worker-tests-positive-for-coronavirus/\">Florida</a>, poll workers and voters tested positive for Covid-19 after election day. \u201c[T]he holding of a presidential primary could strain the system to the point of buckling,\u201d Robert Brehm, the co-executive director of the New York State Board of Elections, <a href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.536316/gov.uscourts.nysd.536316.27.0.pdf\">wrote in a court filing</a>.</p> <p>But Torres noted that the state was<a href=\"https://www.syracuse.com/coronavirus/2020/04/new-york-primary-all-voters-to-get-absentee-ballot-application-by-mail.html\"> encouraging voters </a>to vote by mail and doubted that cancelling the presidential primary entirely would significantly stop the spread of Covid-19. (A spokesman for the New York State Board of Elections declined to comment on the ruling, saying lawyers were reviewing it.)</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/02/michael-bloomberg-expands-influence-network-within-democratic-party\">Michael Bloomberg expands influence network within Democratic party</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Before Tuesday\u2019s decision, Sanders supporters said the cancellation amounted to a stunning episode of voter suppression from Democrats at a time when the party is making expanding voting rights a core part of its platform. \u201cIt\u2019s an insult to us,\u201d said Habiba Choudhary, who had been canvassing for the senator.</p> <p>But New York has long placed severe restrictions on voting, despite its reputation as one of the most progressive states in the US. The state had one of the lowest <a href=\"https://www.nonprofitvote.org/documents/2019/03/america-goes-polls-2018.pdf/\">voter turnout rates</a> in the 2016 election.</p> <p>Biden is unlikely to lose New York and its 29 electoral college votes in November. But not giving Sanders supporters the chance to cast even a symbolic vote for him would have left his supporters unmotivated to commit to organizing for Biden, said Melanie D\u2019Arrigo, who is running in a Democratic congressional primary in June.</p> <p>\u201cWill those voters knock doors, will those voters make calls, will those voters advocate on behalf of Joe Biden? I don\u2019t know,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Some voters, such as Key, had also considered not voting in the general election at all.</p> <p>It\u2019s possible the back and forth of the election commission could still cause confusion. The cancellation would have meant that 35 of New York\u2019s 62 counties will have a reduction in the number of voters who have primaries, and <a href=\"https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.536316/gov.uscourts.nysd.536316.27.0.pdf\">seven counties</a> wouldn\u2019t have had a primary at all. Campaigns have been relying on text messaging and email campaigns to keep people informed.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s uncanny how many people think the next election is in November now,\u201d said Jabari Brisport, a Democrat who is running in a primary for a state senate seat in Brooklyn.</p> <p>There\u2019s more at stake than the presidential primary in New York. New York has become home to a wave of progressive politicians, most notable Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Brisport said botching the primary would make it harder to replicate that success.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of progressive challengers like myself see this a direct attempt to protect incumbents,\u201d he said of the previously cancelled presidential primary.</p> <p>With just a few months until the Democratic conventions, Rachel Himes, an organizer with the Democratic Socialists of America who canvassed for Sanders, said New York voters deserve to have their voices heard.</p> <p>\u201cThe principle of democracy is such that even when it seems like the election is a foregone conclusion, everyone should be able to vote,\u201d said Himes. \u201cPeople don\u2019t have investment in the process, and why would they?\u201d</p>",

A sign at the entrance urged visitors to wear masks at all times, but a White House official said the company had informed them in advance that a mask was not required.</p> \n<p>The visit was meant to underscore the administration\u2019s efforts to nudge a cautious nation, still grappling with economic and public health disasters inflicted by the virus, to return to a more normal way of life. It was also an opportunity for Trump, who has been sharply criticized for his handling of the virus and not doing more to secure protective medical equipment, to point to the mass manufacturing of vital supplies.</p> \n<p>Trump has cheered moves by some governors to reopen their economies, despite a failure to meet guidelines for lifting safety restrictions issued by the White House and concern from public health officials that states are acting too quickly.</p> \n<p>Despite Trump\u2019s optimism, wide majorities of Americans oppose the reopening of businesses and restaurants.

Trump pledged $600m to help the Navajo Nation fight the pandemic during a roundtable with tribal leaders.</p> \n<p>Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, said Trump had worsened the public health crisis by refusing to reopen enrollment in the Affordable Care Act amid the pandemic, which Ducey recommended.</p> \n<p>\u201cPresident Trump will try to paper over his administration\u2019s failed response to the Covid-19 pandemic when he travels today to Arizona,\u201d he said in a statement, \u201cbut nothing can cover up how he failed to prepare our country for this pandemic and his slow response.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>A political battleground in Arizona</strong></h2> \n<p>Some of Trump\u2019s most raucous rallies have been in Arizona, where he has a devoted base.
