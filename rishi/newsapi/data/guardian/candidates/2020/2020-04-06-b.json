It will decide whether or not we will rise again after Easter,\u201d Kurz said, referring to the resurrection of Jesus, the culmination of the Easter feast, which is widely celebrated in the overwhelmingly Catholic country.</p> \n  <p>From 1 May, all shops, shopping centres and hairdressers will be allowed to open.

They should be used by the whole of the country. Those who don\u2019t have a mobile phone will be required to wear a special key-ring style device, the chancellor said at the weekend.

It is being developed in conjunction with a European app that 130 researchers are developing, and will warn people if they might have had contact with infected persons. Its use is expected to be anonymous and voluntary, although surveys show a large number of Germans are prepared to use it if it leads to a relaxation of lockdown rules. The ultimate aim should be to have a single, Europe-wide tracking app. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIts use should be voluntary, but obviously with the hope that as many people as possible will use it,\u201d Steffen Seibert, spokesman for the German government said this afternoon. \u201cPeople who use it will be doing their significant bit to reduce the spread of the infection and helping measures to fight it.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-06T13:52:18.409Z\">at 2.52pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8b1a298f08c35a1d11ad59\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-06T12:08:27.447Z\">1.08pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Eugen Tomac, a Romanian MEP, has tabled a written question in the European parliament asking what measures the European commission intends to take to forestall the spread of Covid-19 among refugees in the Greek islands. <br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> \n  <p>Fears are growing that the conditions in which refugees are living on Europe\u2019s borders are ripe for the spread of pandemic disease.

As the EU\u2019s fight to contain the virus continues, nearly 42 000 asylum seekers are living in squalid conditions in hotspots on the Greek islands. This is likely to lead to an outbreak. Hence, can the Commission answer the following questions:</p> \n   <p>1. How does it intend to ensure the right to health in the refugee camps is respected?</p> \n   <p>2. What measures have been taken to prevent a COVID-19 outbreak within the overcrowded camps?</p> \n   <p>3.

The Fox News hosts Laura Ingraham and Sean Hannity have been promoting hydroxychloroquine on their shows.</p> \n<p>Last week the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) provided hydroxychloroquine with an \u201cemergency use authorization\u201d to use on coronavirus patients in some circumstances. State officials in New York have said that about 4,000 seriously ill patients are now being treated with the drug.</p> \n<p>But with some Americans turning to unconventional, and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/03/24/coronavirus-chloroquine-poisoning-death/\">potentially deadly</a>, treatments for coronavirus, medical experts have called for considered, accurate information to avoid exacerbating the pandemic.</p> \n<p>Last month an Arizona man <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/coronavirus-cure-kills-man-after-trump-touts-chloroquine-phosphate\">died</a> and his wife was left in critical condition after the couple took chloroquine phosphate, an additive used to clean fish tanks that is related to the composition of the anti-malaria treatment promoted by Trump.</p> \n<p>\u201cTrump kept saying it was basically pretty much a cure,\u201d the woman told NBC, before advising: \u201cDon\u2019t take anything. Don\u2019t believe anything. Don\u2019t believe anything that the president says and his people \u2026 call your doctor.\u201d</p> \n<p>Here are the key things to know:</p> \n<h2><strong>What is hydroxychloroquine?</strong></h2> \n<p>Hydroxychloroquine, also known by its brand name, Plaquenil, is a drug used to treat malaria. It is a less toxic version of chloroquine, another malaria drug, which itself is related to quinine, an ingredient in tonic water.</p> \n<p>It is also readily available to Americans \u2013 already approved as a malaria and anti-inflammation treatment by the FDA \u2013 where it is an off-the-shelf drug with various low-cost generic versions. Despite the emergency use order, the FDA has not conducted clinical trials to fully ascertain whether the drug is an effective treatment for Covid-19.</p> \n<h2>Why is Trump touting it?</h2> \n<p>Trump was influenced by a widely publicized study in France where 40 coronavirus patients were given hydroxychloroquine, with more than half experiencing the clearing of their airways within three to six days. This apparent improvement is important as it would curtail the timeframe in which infected people could spread Covid-19 to others.</p> \n<p>However, experts have warned that the study is small and lacks sufficient rigor to be classed as evidence of a potential treatment. The French health ministry has warned against the use of hydroxychloroquine for Covid-19, with Olivier V\u00e9ran, France\u2019s health minister, saying that it shouldn\u2019t be used by anyone with the exception of \u201cserious forms of hospitalization and on the collegial decision of doctors and under strict medical supervision\u201d.</p> \n<h2><strong>What does the evidence show?</strong></h2> \n<p>The French study followed work by Chinese researchers which suggested that hydroxychloroquine can slow infections from Sars-CoV-2, the virus behind Covid-19, by blocking it from entering cells in the body. But more recent, albeit small-scale, research from China has shown that patients who were treated with the drugs fought off coronavirus no more quickly than those who didn\u2019t get it. Indeed, one patient given hydroxychloroquine severely worsened in condition while four patients on the medicine developed signs of liver damage and experienced diarrhea.</p> \n<p>Regardless of these findings, any drug being used for a certain purpose before full clinical trials are completed is, by definition, untested and unproven. It\u2019s too early to say if hydroxychloroquine can have a major benefit or not.</p> \n<p>The European Medicines Agency, an agency of the EU, has said hydroxychloroquine should not be taken by coronavirus patients except for clinical trials or emergency use programs.</p> \n<h2>Are there any downsides to this drug being in demand?</h2> \n<p>Like many drugs, hydroxychloroquine comes with a number of potential side-effects. These include headaches, dizziness, stomach pain, weight loss and mood changes.</p> \n<p>Worse, a sudden surge in demand for hydroxychloroquine risks shortages of the drug for those who need it most. Hydroxychloroquine is able to keep lupus, a chronic autoimmune disease, in check but some people with the condition have complained they are now unable to find Plaquenil. Trump\u2019s pushing of the treatment has caused many Americans, whether they need it or not, to stock up on the drug.</p> \n<h2>What should people do instead?</h2> \n<p>The latest Chinese research suggests that using hydroxychloroquine is no better than more conventional coronavirus treatments, such as bed rest, antiviral drugs and oxygen inhalation. There are about 40 different research efforts around the world to find a vaccine, which may take a year or more, while scientists rummaging around in the existing medical cabinet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/19/prospects-treatment-coronavirus-drugs-vaccines\">have identified some other drugs</a> that may be repurposed to tackle Covid-19. But this work, too, will take time.</p> \n<h2>Conclusion?</h2> \n<p>There is no magic cure for this pandemic, no matter what Trump says.</p> \n<p><em>Due to the unprecedented and ongoing nature of the coronavirus outbreak, this article is being regularly updated to ensure that it reflects the current situation at the date of publication.

  "<p>A court in Slovakia has sentenced a former soldier to 23 years in prison for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/26/slovakian-journalist-investigating-claims-of-tax-linked-to-ruling-party-shot-dead\">murder of the investigative journalist</a> J\u00e1n Kuciak and his fiancee, Martina Ku\u0161n\u00edrov\u00e1, in February 2018.</p> <p>The double murder of the recently engaged couple, both of whom were 27 at the time, shocked Slovakia and led to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/06/slovakia-thousands-protest-against-business-as-usual-under-new-leaders\">protests that eventually </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/06/slovakia-thousands-protest-against-business-as-usual-under-new-leaders\">led to the resignation of the prime minister</a>.</p> <p>On Monday, a court in Pezinok, north of Bratislava, handed down the sentence to 37-year-old Miroslav Mar\u010dek. He was also convicted of carrying out an unrelated hit on a businessman in 2016. The alleged mastermind of the murder, a businessman who had previously threatened Kuciak, will stand trial in a separate court case.</p> <p>\u201cIt was cold-blooded and malicious. The victims did not have a chance to defend themselves,\u201d said the presiding judge, Ruzena Szabova, handing down the verdict to Mar\u010dek. She said his confession and eventual cooperation with authorities had been a mitigating circumstance. Mar\u010dek can appeal to Slovakia\u2019s supreme court over the verdict.</p> <p>Kuciak was a young and well-liked reporter specialising in data journalism, who had reported on corruption and links between the crime world and official figures for the Slovak news outlet Aktuality.sk. At the time of his death, he was midway through an investigation about links between Italian mafia groups and the Slovak political system.</p> <p>The businessman Mari\u00e1n Ko\u010dner is accused of organising and paying for the murder. Three other people are also charged with aiding the murder. Last month, Slovak police said they had arrested 18 people, including 13 judges, who are accused of attempting to obstruct the investigation into the murders.</p> <p>Ko\u010dner has admitted carrying an illegal firearm but denies murder. Kuciak had written about Ko\u010dner and even been threatened by him, but few believed his life was in danger, and the murders shocked the country. The killings sparked large-scale protests, which led to the resignation of long-standing prime minister Robert Fico a month later. Then, last year, the liberal former civil society activist Zuzana \u010caputov\u00e1 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/13/zuzana-caputova-slovakia-president-spiritual-liberal-progressive-values\">won the presidency</a> after promising a gentler and kinder politics.</p> <p>Fico\u2019s Smer party continued to be the governing party until two months ago, when it was ousted by a coalition of four other parties, after a general election campaign in which rule of law and the legacy of the Kuciak murder played a large part.</p> <p>Ko\u010dner\u2019s trial is due to start later this month.</p>",

A year later, Wisconsin deactivated roughly 308,000 registrations, but eventually, the state <a href=\"https://www.wiscontext.org/navigating-confusion-wisconsins-voter-roll-purge\">reinstated</a> approximately 7,000 voters who were erroneously struck off.</p> <p>In 2019, the state decided it wouldn\u2019t remove voters from the rolls until 2021, to avoid making the same mistake before this year\u2019s presidential election. Yet in November, the Wisconsin Institute for Law &amp; Liberty (<a href=\"https://www.will-law.org/\">Will</a>), a conservative non-profit law firm, sued the Wisconsin elections commission, claiming it violated state law by putting off the cancellations.</p> <p>The removals have so far continued to be blocked, but Will is asking the Wisconsin supreme court to hear the case before the election.</p> <p>Will\u2019s president, Rick Esenberg, has argued that the process won\u2019t disenfranchise voters because they can register at the polls <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/same-day-registration.aspx\">on election day</a>. But in-person voting may be hampered by the coronavirus outbreak.</p> <p>\u201cThis Will lawsuit says: let\u2019s deactivate these people immediately and get them to register again. But that defeats the whole purpose,\u201d said Reid Magney, a spokesman for the Wisconsin election commission. \u201cThe more people who have to re-register on election day, the longer the lines are.\u201d</p> <p>The zip code in Wisconsin where voters had the greatest odds of being put on the list of potential movers was composed entirely of student housing for the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Here, one in four voters, who are likely to vote Democrat, got a mover letter from the state.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/index-html-9-zip/giv-39026r6VIWfFLJQe/index.html\" data-alt=\"College student population vs probability of receiving a voter form\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/index-html-9-zip/giv-39026r6VIWfFLJQe/index.html\">College student population vs probability of receiving a voter form</a> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2018/08/interactive-now-and-then-embed/embed/embed.html?mobile_before=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55d08cf489f6b8ff2b28740c794c1228881cb81e/0_7_3003_1803/master/3003..jpg----width=500____quality=85____s=f26e5428676d9969738952505ff6ab87&amp;desktop_before=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55d08cf489f6b8ff2b28740c794c1228881cb81e/0_7_3003_1803/master/3003..jpg----width=1000____quality=85____s=70e0cb7538e013878c56ee8047f453b2&amp;label_before=1&amp;mobile_after=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c665db46a5ef04df0fddf1cfa397950a3314b5d/0_7_3003_1803/master/3003..jpg----width=500____quality=85____s=4ade8f8a514d78aa20e51f69dc0a4d9a&amp;desktop_after=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c665db46a5ef04df0fddf1cfa397950a3314b5d/0_7_3003_1803/master/3003..jpg----width=1000____quality=85____s=f1f80cc431c7e177fee1730b212faedb&amp;label_after=2&amp;analytics_label=wisconsin&amp;type=fader&amp;\" data-alt=\"a map of parts of Wisconsin that have at least a 10% college-student population compared to where at least 8% of households received voter purge forms\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/2018/08/interactive-now-and-then-embed/embed/embed.html?mobile_before=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55d08cf489f6b8ff2b28740c794c1228881cb81e/0_7_3003_1803/master/3003..jpg----width=500____quality=85____s=f26e5428676d9969738952505ff6ab87&desktop_before=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/55d08cf489f6b8ff2b28740c794c1228881cb81e/0_7_3003_1803/master/3003..jpg----width=1000____quality=85____s=70e0cb7538e013878c56ee8047f453b2&label_before=1&mobile_after=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c665db46a5ef04df0fddf1cfa397950a3314b5d/0_7_3003_1803/master/3003..jpg----width=500____quality=85____s=4ade8f8a514d78aa20e51f69dc0a4d9a&desktop_after=//i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9c665db46a5ef04df0fddf1cfa397950a3314b5d/0_7_3003_1803/master/3003..jpg----width=1000____quality=85____s=f1f80cc431c7e177fee1730b212faedb&label_after=2&analytics_label=wisconsin&type=fader&\">a map of parts of Wisconsin that have at least a 10% college-student population compared to where at least 8% of households received voter purge forms</a> <figcaption>Guardian graphic | Source: Guardian investigation</figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not hard to see why college students \u2013 who have notoriously unstable addresses while they are in school, often changing one or more times a year \u2013 would be flagged,\u201d said Kenneth Mayer, a political science professor at UW-Madison.</p> <p>This can lead to confusion.

Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>One person closely involved said: \u201cThe difficulty is that the crisis is so all-enveloping, the PM could not stop working. No one likes to think they are dispensable. The first step was to get him to admit to himself how ill he was becoming. What was subsequently admitted to the nation was a second order issue\u201d.</p> \n<p>Even now No 10 is reluctant to go into detail on the prime minister\u2019s health, stressing in its statement that the hospital admission was simply a precautionary step to undertake tests, rather than an acknowledgement that he had deteriorated. He would continue to be briefed at his hospital bed and was very much in charge.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"d6a01fe6-79ff-49a8-89ef-f39231b8bcc6\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0Q6jmZ7RLDw?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>By contrast, Donald Trump in opening his Sunday press conference provided a dramatic, possibly melodramatic, medical bulletin on Johnson\u2019s health, offering the US\u2019s prayers to help Johnson in \u201chis personal fight with the virus\u201d. Trump has a relationship with the truth that could be described as sometimes adjacent, but he did not give the impression that Johnson was going to hospital for routine tests.</p> \n<p>If No 10 is being economical about a more serious illness, it would not be the first time the public has been misled by a serving prime minister about his health. The UK may be at war with an invisible virus, but British prime ministers at times of conflict have always been reluctant to admit they have been incapacitated. David Lloyd George in 1918 suffered a bout of influenza so severe his valet said it was touch and go whether he would survive. Medical bulletins at the time made no suggestion he was in any danger.</p> \n<p>Andrew Bonar Law resigned in 1923 only on receiving a diagnosis of terminal throat cancer, and Henry Campbell-Bannerman, prime minister from 1905 to 1908, died days after his resignation in 10 Downing Street.</p> \n<p>During Winston Churchill\u2019s two wartime illnesses, the full extent of them was never revealed. In February 1943, after the then 69-year-old contracted pneumonia, his personal physician Charles Wilson drafted a bulletin, but Churchill immediately demanded to see it. He dismissed it as \u201calarmist\u201d and liable to cause confusion and despondency and was, in any case, untrue.</p> \n<p>Churchill, therefore, dictated his own bulletin, but Wilson said it was inaccurate and misleading and he could not possibly sign it. Elaborate textual negotiations led to a compromise, and subsequent bulletins always referred to his improving condition.</p> \n<p>A further bout of pneumonia in August 1944 was not publicised at all, and according to his wife, Clementine, only the smallest circle was informed.</p> \n<p>Similarly, the cocktail of drugs being taken by Anthony Eden during the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/mar/14/past.education1\">Suez crisis</a> was known only to a few, and even now the impact on his judgment is a matter of dispute.</p> \n<p>But these were more discreet times, and the ruling class could form a small circle of trust. That in turn made it easier to put out bland medical bulletins that disguised more than they revealed.</p> \n<p>The White House has been equally skilled at suppressing the truth about its president\u2019s health. Franklin D Roosevelt famously had polio, Dwight D Eisenhower had both a heart attack and a stroke while in office. John F Kennedy suffered Addison\u2019s disease, hypothyroidism and severe back pain, none of which was publicly disclosed during his lifetime. Grover Cleveland in 1893 even had a secret operation to remove a cancerous growth that took place on a boat, dressed up as a fishing trip on a lake.</p> \n<p>The fear that power, credibility and respect will seep away if ill health is revealed remains. Not just the electorate will lose faith, but your cabinet colleagues may sniff a succession. Tony Blair was reluctant to reveal his heart issues for fear allies of the the then chancellor, Gordon Brown, might take advantage.</p> \n<p>Hillary Clinton was hammered when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/11/hillary-clinton-health-pneumonia\">she contracted pneumonia</a>, and wobbled in front of the TV cameras when walking to a car. In 2016 news of her illness received 13 times more coverage than revelations about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/07/donald-trump-charity-foundation-misuse-lawsuit\">fraud in Trump\u2019s charitable foundation</a>. Bernie Sanders has frantically denied <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/04/bernie-sanders-heart-attack-hospital-release\">his heart attack</a> makes him the weaker of the three septuagenarians seeking the presidency.</p> \n<p>But outright suppression of the truth in modern politics has its downsides. Figures such as Peter Mandelson, Gordon Brown\u2019s chief communicator after the financial crash, have warned the prerequisite for national unity at a time of genuine crisis is a government that levels with the British public about the difficulties the Whitehall machine is facing. </p> \n<p>There will come a point when, if Johnson\u2019s condition is serious, the medical and spin doctors will have to tell the public as much.</p>",
  "<p>Holly Rasmussen is not one to pay much attention to the detail of politics, and certainly not to sit through presidential press conferences. After all, she has a business to run. Or used to.</p> <p>But in recent days, Rasmussen, who lives in northern Iowa, has been drawn to Donald Trump\u2019s widely scorned daily television briefings, and she likes what she sees.</p> <p>\u201cI think he is staying extremely optimistic and I think that\u2019s what a lot of us need,\u201d she said. \u201cI think he\u2019s leading. And this is an unprecedented time to do the best he can without having more people die and the economy completely tank.\u201d</p> <p>Rasmussen is one of those voters who swung from Barack Obama to Trump and then stuck with the president because she reckoned he was doing a good job with the economy. Now, as coronavirus destroys lives, jobs and businesses \u2013 and threatens to drive Rasmussen\u2019s cosmetology school to the wall \u2013 she is among those Americans who have bumped up the president\u2019s approval ratings even as he faces a barrage of scorn over his handling of the pandemic.</p> <p>The latest <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/298313/president-trump-job-approval-rating.aspx\">Gallup poll</a> gave Trump the highest approval numbers of his presidency, bolstered by swing voters, independents and even some Democrats.</p> <p>The poll is no more than a snapshot in a rapidly evolving crisis, and opinions may change radically in the coming weeks as the death toll rises and the loss of jobs bites deep.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0f1a65de87350a7a68c4ec3c6275c86ac5714466\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f1a65de87350a7a68c4ec3c6275c86ac5714466/0_305_4032_2419/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Holly Rasmussen: \u2018I think he is staying extremely optimistic and I think that\u2019s what a lot of us need.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Holly Rasmussen: \u2018I think he is staying extremely optimistic and I think that\u2019s what a lot of us need.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris McGreal</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In addition, Rasmussen lives in the small city of Cresco close to Iowa\u2019s northern border with Minnesota. Like much of the midwest, it has yet to be badly hit by the virus and attitudes to the president\u2019s handling of the crisis may shift against him when it is.</p> <p>But for now, towns and cities across the region are watching the approach of coronavirus with fearful resignation, and many there are prepared to give Trump the benefit of the doubt for now.</p> <p>In southern Missouri, Cindy Anderson \u2013 doing her job in the payroll department of a mental health counselling service from home \u2013 worries that when the virus finally hits, small cities like Kennet will be woefully unprepared not least because its only hospital closed a few months ago.</p> <p>\u201cI think we\u2019ve been forgotten about in a little part of the world because we\u2019re rural. Unfortunately, the area in which we live, there is a lot of poverty and a lot of sick people. When it hits, I\u2019m sure that it will be devastating,\u201d she said.</p> <p>For all that, Anderson thinks Trump is making the best of a bad situation even if he has made mistakes. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he\u2019s got it right, but I think he\u2019s trying. I think he\u2019s effective,\u201d she said.</p> <p>But the 65-year-old is frustrated at what she regards as politicised attacks on Trump over his actions, or lack of them, early on in the crisis when she says the focus should be on how to get through this.</p> <p>\u201cI think that a lot of the news media, they don\u2019t tell the whole story. They tell the piece that sounds the most damning and they don\u2019t add the other piece,\u201d she said.</p> <p>That\u2019s a view shared by Rasmussen.</p> <p>\u201cI would rather have just the issues of what\u2019s going on with the coronavirus and what they are doing to help us then just nit picking stuff that I was seeing,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Rasmussen is critical of the scorn poured on the president when he hesitated to call for businesses to close because of the economic impact. She said his concerns about the financial consequences were legitimate.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1873c078c4517e97dc4804a41c5d15f31a57b945\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1873c078c4517e97dc4804a41c5d15f31a57b945/0_190_4000_2400/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump delivers remarks at a coronavirus briefing at the White House.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump delivers remarks at a coronavirus briefing at the White House.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The shut down required Rasmussen to close her cosmetology school, leaving her workers without pay and her school facing bankruptcy if the shutdown lasts more than another two months.

At first, the numbers of deaths from coronavirus, compared them to lives claimed by flu, opioid overdoses and car crashes did not look startling, and some wondered if the threat was far away and overblown.

It is a less toxic version of chloroquine, another malaria drug, which itself is related to quinine, an ingredient in tonic water.</li> \n   <li>Like many drugs, hydroxychloroquine comes with a number of potential side-effects. These include headaches, dizziness, stomach pain, weight loss and mood changes. </li> \n   <li>A sudden surge in demand for hydroxychloroquine risks shortages of the drug for those who need it most. Hydroxychloroquine is able to keep lupus, a chronic autoimmune disease, in check but some people with the condition have complained they are now unable to find Plaquenil. Trump\u2019s pushing of the treatment has caused many Americans, whether they need it or not, to stock up on the drug.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8a65e88f08c9eaf0daf04c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-05T23:13:24.910Z\">12.13am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>US president Donald Trump opened tonight\u2019s White House briefing with well wishes for UK PM Boris Johnson. </p> \n  <p>\u201cHe\u2019s a great friend of mine,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI\u2019m sure he is going to be fine, he\u2019s a strong man, a strong person.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8a65658f08c35a1d11a814\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/sarahboseley\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-05T23:11:14.340Z\">12.11am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <h2>Johnson\u2019s hospital admission suggests virus may have progressed</h2> \n  <p>Most people recover from Covid-19 within a week and cannot even be certain they had it, as they probably won\u2019t be tested.

Spain has recorded 130,759 confirmed cases, according to the health ministry. </p> \n  <p>The latest data suggests the growth in the number of infections has slowed to around 5% \u2013 the smallest increase seen since officials began tracking the outbreak. The actual number of cases in the country, however, is likely higher after hard-hit regions such as Madrid and Catalonia instructed people with mild symptoms to self-isolate rather than seek testing,</p> \n  <p>While officials urged caution in interpreting the data, they noted the figures hint at a downward trend, with fewer hospitalisations and a drop in patients needing critical care. \u201cThe sense that we\u2019re getting from the regions is that the pressure is easing,\u201d said Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9 Sierra of Spain\u2019s health emergency centre. \u201cIt\u2019s what we expected after three weeks of distancing measures.\u201d </p> \n  <p>Hans Kluge of the World Health Organization echoed her cautious tone. \u201cCareful optimism as a result of bold measures, innovative approaches and courageous decisions,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hans_kluge/status/1246732106946023430\">he wrote on Twitter</a> after wrapping up a mission to Spain. </p> \n  <p>He added that he had been deeply impressed by the heroism of the country\u2019s frontline workers and the solidarity among Spain\u2019s residents.</p> \n  <p> The impact of the virus has been widespread across the country, which not a single Spanish region spared. As the number of cases continues its steady climb upwards, a handful of municipalities have cut themselves off from the rest of Spain \u2013 and the world \u2013 in hopes of keeping the virus out.</p> \n  <p>Among the most fervent is the southern Spanish municipality of Zahara de la Sierra. Home to some 1,400 people and perched high on a mountain, local officials have used chains and fences to block off all but one of the five access roads to the white village.</p> \n  <p> Police keep constant watch over the one road that remains open, stopping every vehicle that passes to ensure they have the necessary authorisation to enter the town. </p> \n  <p>Those that are allowed through are sprayed with disinfectant before they can proceed up to the fortress town. \u201cFortunately, we don\u2019t have one (coronavirus) case in this municipality, nor anyone in quarantine,\u201d mayor Santiago Galv\u00e1n told Europa Press. </p> \n  <p> Nearby, the village of Setenil de las Bodegas has also sprang into action. Popular with daytrippers who flock to visit its houses built into the rocks that loom over the village, officials have dumped hundreds of kilograms of dirt to block off most roads leading into the municipality.</p> \n  <p> Home to some 2,700 people, the local council <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aytodesetenil/status/1243961681346248705\">recently announced plans to disinfect</a> all of the streets of the village on a daily basis while any vehicle that enters must pass under a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aytodesetenil/status/1244986737052524545\">custom-built arch</a> that showers them with disinfectant.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-05T12:20:42.889Z\">at 1.20pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e89c4398f080bdb9f53482d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-05T11:45:52.497Z\">12.45pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Singapore </strong>has recorded a 60% increase in coronavirus cases in a single day.</p> \n  <p>The county\u2019s health ministry reported 120 new cases of the virus on Sunday, in comparison to 75 on Saturday.
