The spike protein is the main target of leading vaccine programmes around the world, and if it changes too much those vaccines may no longer work.

The government cannot immediately ensure a return to normality ... we are still in this pandemic.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Autonomous moves by regions would be considered illegitimate, he added, opening the way for confrontations with regional chiefs set on defying the central government.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-30T14:01:54.973Z\">at 3.01pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eaad1b78f08a459b6585143\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-30T13:26:58.472Z\">2.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>It\u2019s <strong>Simon Murphy</strong> here taking over the live blog while my colleague, <strong>Alexandra Topping,</strong> takes a well-earned break.

<p>\u201cWe\u2019re not yet at the peak of the distress as a result of the lockdown. It will emerge over the coming weeks,\u201d said Sir Peter Gluckman, who was the chief science advisor to New Zealand\u2019s prime minister from 2009 until 2018.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWith that will emerge some groups of people who will do well, they will find in the change opportunity, but many people who will be very uncertain, very scared, frustrated, angry, and we know from other disasters that about 10% or more even will progress to actual depression and to suicidality.\u201d</p> \n  <p>However Gluckman also said the country possessed unique assets that could see it navigate the coronavirus crisis better than other nations would.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/emotional-fallout-of-covid-19-lockdown-yet-to-peak-says-new-zealand-scientist\">Emotional fallout of Covid-19 lockdown yet to peak, says New Zealand scientist</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eaa5da48f08745586318479\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/martinfarrer\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-30T05:10:32.755Z\">6.10am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In the UK, the cabinet will meet today to discuss <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/29/social-bubbles-of-small-groups-could-be-early-step-out-of-lockdown\">when to start easing the lockdown</a> as the government deadline for testing 100,000 people per day looks like passing without the target being reached.

Under that scheme, people are referred for help by their GPs. In some cases, volunteers have called the person \u201cin need\u201d and they have no idea why they are being contacted. Mutual aid networks, in comparison, work almost street by street, with most doors have had a flyer offering help pushed through the letterbox. These networks are also not hamstrung by concerns about data protection and privacy regulations or worries about insurance.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/sitting-at-home-seems-wrong-coronavirus-volunteers-helping-the-nhs-a-photo-essay\">'Sitting at home seems wrong': NHS coronavirus volunteers \u2013 a photo essay</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eaa57e48f0882b206dcfbe0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-30T04:55:09.300Z\">5.55am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Dr Deborah Birx, the White House\u2019s coronavirus taskforce coordinator is known for her reassuring appearances at Donald Trump\u2019s erratic and often astonishing White House press briefings.<br></p> \n  <p>Most recently, a video of her face <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/26/coronavirus-birx-trump-disinfectant-remarks\">as the US president suggested injecting disinfectant </a>into human beings might cure coronavirus went viral.

  "<p>Fifa is preparing to press the authorities in Switzerland to prosecute Sepp Blatter for alleged corruption, after the Swiss attorney general dropped part of its investigation despite police reports listing years of apparent gifts and payments provided to the then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/sep/29/jack-warner-banned-football-life-fifa-ethics-committee\">vice-president, Jack Warner</a>, in return for votes for Blatter in Fifa presidential elections. </p> <p>Senior Fifa officials are understood to be considering all options if the case against Blatter is discontinued, potentially including suing the attorney general\u2019s office for failing to prosecute.</p> <p>In two Swiss federal police reports seen by the Guardian, a conclusion is drawn that Warner wielded crucial votes to support Blatter and elect him Fifa president in 1998 and 2002 in return for \u201cpreferential treatment\u201d, including TV contracts for the 2010 and 2014 World Cups.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/07/world-cup-likely-to-stay-in-qatar-despite-new-bribery-accusations-in-us\">World Cup likely to stay in Qatar despite new bribery accusations in US</a> </p> </aside>  <p>From 1990 to 2011 Warner was president of Concacaf \u2013 the Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football \u2013 which had more than 40 countries as members and whose votes, invariably wielded as a bloc, were crucial in presidential elections.</p> <p>Blatter\u2019s tenure as president of Fifa, from his successful 1998 election campaign to his fall in 2015, was marked throughout by corruption allegations, which he denied, but efforts to oppose him, mostly marshalled by the Scandinavian countries\u2019 FAs, failed to garner sufficient votes.</p> <p>One police report states Warner and Concacaf had \u201calready been granted a financial advantage in May 1998\u201d a month before Blatter, previously the Fifa general-secretary, was elected president for the first time. The other report contains details of a 2005 contract signed by Blatter, granting the TV rights for the 2010 and 2014 World Cups to the Caribbean Football Union, of which Warner was also president.</p> <p>The report noted that a $14m payment from a broadcaster for the rights was diverted by means of a sub-agreement to a company owned by Warner. It states $3.78m was due back to Fifa under the terms of the agreement but the CFU never paid it and Fifa has never received it.</p> <p>\u201cOn the basis of the information at hand,\u201d the police report states in its conclusion, \u201ca link can be established between the preferential treatment of Warner and the Concacaf votes required for Blatter\u2019s election at the Fifa presidential elections in the years 1998 and 2002.\u201d</p> <p>In a statement the Swiss Office of the Attorney General confirmed it is ending one part of its investigation into Blatter for alleged \u201caggravated criminal mismanagement\u201d. This was opened in September 2015 as his presidency collapsed under multiple anti-corruption proceedings, mainly mounted by the US Department of Justice. The OAG said the concluded part relates to \u201cthe criminal investigation\u2019s facts and accusations regarding the contractual relationship with the Caribbean Football Union\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/dec/11/fifa-prepares-to-sue-michel-platini-and-sepp-blatter-to-get-15m-back\">Fifa prepares to sue Sepp Blatter and Michel Platini to get \u00a31.5m back</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Although the OAG said it continues to pursue other areas of its investigation, officials at Fifa working under Gianni Infantino, who replaced Blatter in February 2016, are said to be intent on pressing the case. Fifa as an organisation is formally classed as a victim in the proceedings and is taking legal action for the return of any money found to have been illicitly paid out. Some unfavourable comparisons are being drawn between the lack of prosecutions in Switzerland five years since investigations began and multiple convictions secured by the US authorities.</p> <p>Blatter has not been charged by US authorities and maintains his innocence of any wrongdoing. His representative said he had no comment to make. Warner is indicted for multiple corruption offences in the US, which he rejects, and he is contesting extradition proceedings from his home island of Trinidad. He did not respond to an email from the Guardian about the contents of the Swiss police reports.</p> <p>A Fifa spokesperson said in an official statement: \u201cFifa will continue to cooperate with all law enforcement agencies, including those in Switzerland, in the hope and belief that all those responsible for causing harm to football will finally be held to account.\u201d</p>",

Congressional Republicans rejected funding for the postal service in the latest stimulus bill, as Trump called it a \u201cjoke\u201d and claimed it undercharges Amazon for its packages (his administration has debunked this) on account of his personal obsession with Jeff Bezos for owning the Washington Post.</p> <p>The postal service, crucial for mail-in voting, has seen volume drop by a third, more than 1,200 workers out with coronavirus and many more concerned about lack of basic supplies and protections on the job. Still, it\u2019s \u201cone of the only federal agencies directly authorized in the constitution, and it\u2019s one of the most democratic institutions we have\u201d, Bee explained.</p> <p>\u201cBut even if their voters like it, Republican leaders hate when the government actually works,\u201d Bee added. \u201cThey\u2019re been trying to undermine the postal service for decades, going back to 1982, when Ronald Reagan signed a law requiring NBC\u2019s Thursday night lineup to feature at least one asshole mailman at all times.\u201d In all seriousness, Republicans have in recent years tried to lower wages, reduce benefits and cut routes in an effort to privatize the service. \u201cIt\u2019s ridiculous to expect the post office to be a money-making enterprise! It\u2019s a public good,\u201d Bee said. \u201cExpecting the post office to turn a profit is like expecting public libraries to sell the right to use their bathroom.\u201d</p> <h2>Trevor Noah</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1255692600343883776\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">A look at how COVID-19 is wreaking havoc on the food supply chain around the world: <a href=\"https://t.co/IPqV4wAKmg\">pic.twitter.com/IPqV4wAKmg</a></p>&mdash; The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1255692600343883776?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 30, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>And on the Daily Show, Trevor Noah addressed food supply fears, as meat-processing plants across the country shut down due to coronavirus updates. Earlier this week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/28/trump-executive-order-meat-processing-plants-coronavirus\">Trump signed an executive order</a> under the Defense Production Act to keep some processing plants open and running at maximum capacity. \u201cYou know, I will say this about Trump: he is very clear about what his priorities are in life,\u201d said Noah. \u201cBecause he was warned for months about the pandemic coming to America and he did practically nothing. But you tell the man once that there could be a beef shortage and he springs into action like the world\u2019s hungriest superhero.\u201d</p> <p>Still, few places in America have experienced higher rates of coronavirus than meat-processing plants. And \u201calthough there doesn\u2019t seem to be a danger to the food itself, in most of these facilities, the workers are quite literally putting their lives on the line\u201d. At many plants, several thousand employees work in close proximity; workers have alleged they were given hairnets to use as face masks.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really sad that these workers are being forced to keep the food chain going but nobody is being forced to protect them while they do it,\u201d Noah concluded. \u201cThey need equipment to keep safe while doing their jobs. And if you eat meat, you especially should want these workers to be treated right, because without them, the only way you\u2019ll get your bacon is if you fight the pig yourself.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Justin Amash\u2019s announcement that he is exploring a run for president on the Libertarian party\u2019s ticket set off a firestorm of debate as to whether his candidacy helps or hurts Donald Trump\u2019s re-election prospects.</p> <p>With paranoia of potential \u201cspoiler\u201d effects running high, <a href=\"https://thebulwark.com/justin-amash-should-not-run-for-president-this-year/\">Never Trump Republicans worked hard to deter Amash from running </a>and upon his announcement, influencers in the movement like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JRubinBlogger/status/1255509011031613449\">Jennifer Rubin</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BillKristol/status/1255484652208390152\">Bill Kristol</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RadioFreeTom/status/1255541955704041474\">Tom Nichols</a> immediately denounced his candidacy.</p> <p>Their wariness is well supported by polling data, which shows <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_biden-6247.html\">Biden\u2019s consistent lead over Trump in general election</a> head-to-head polling <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/04/27/biden-leads-trump-2020-amid-coronavirus-concerns/3029325001/\">narrows when an independent or third-party option is </a>included. It is important to recognize that voters respond to generic independent or third-party candidate cues from their own ideological frame of reference: a progressive probably pictures a progressive candidate, a conservative, a conservative one.</p> <p>It isn\u2019t until these choices solidify into actual candidates and are presented to voters in a context that includes named party nominees that \u201ctrue\u201d third-party or independent receptivity becomes clear. The \u201cpulling from both sides\u201d issue from generic ballots probably distorts the attractiveness of these types of candidates.</p> <p>Further complicating matters, current polling still reflects the contested and contentious Democratic party nomination process. It will take some time for Democrats to consolidate around their party\u2019s nominee in rates comparable to Republican consolidation around Trump, which averages 90%. The inclusive head-to-head ballot test as well as <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/30/us/politics/trump-biden-enthusiasm-gap.html\">nominee enthusiasm</a> are still reflecting after-effects from the primary.</p> <p>We also know that as the election cycle swings into action and campaign activity kicks in, some voters previously open to third-party candidates \u201ccome home\u201d\u2013 which is why <a href=\"https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/blog/none-above-polling-and-third-party-candidates\">third-party candidates tend to underperform their polled vote shares</a>. The \u201ccoming home\u201d effect also affects independents, <a href=\"https://www.people-press.org/2019/03/14/political-independents-who-they-are-what-they-think/\">most of whom are \u201cleaners</a>\u201d, voters who initially say they\u2019re independent, but when prompted with a follow-up question asking whether they are more closely aligned to one party or the other, admit to having a party preference. These voters almost always end up voting for the candidate of the party they lean towards, which is why it is possible that Biden\u2019s large advantages on the generic ballot until now may be inflated.</p> <p>In 2016, the Libertarian party pulled voters from both sides of the ideological spectrum.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUSDIZTSDDg\">unabashed admission to pot use </a>endeared him to thousands of younger voters.

Amash\u2019s presence in the race all but ensures Ventura would be blocked from running on the Libertarian ticket where due to far broader ballot access, he would have more potential \u201cdisruption\u201d power.</p> <p>This means the Libertarian party\u2019s appeal in 2020 will largely hail from voters on the right side of the ideological spectrum. That party leaders have <a href=\"https://reason.com/2019/05/21/libertarians-and-never-trump-republicans-court-justin-amash-to-run-for-president/\">not-so-quietly pushed Amash into running</a> suggests the party\u2019s core membership wants to return to more traditional Libertarian orthodoxies.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>An Amash run may help buffer Democrats from what is sure to be a full court press by Trump\u2019s GOP to encourage disaffected Sanders voters to defect from Biden</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the end, the influence of third-party candidates in the 2020 cycle may be stunted due to the pandemic.

Personally I am and I have been a non-violent man. I don\u2019t understand how someone can make me look like an executioner to the point where families would feel intimidated by me.\u201d</p> <p>The FHF said that it took<strong> \u201c</strong>such serious allegations very seriously. To date, we have never received any complaints to this effect.\u201d</p> <p>It added: \u201cOur project is first of all a human project which aims to change the future of young people, to roll back the exclusion through play even if we know that in this country and even in the world some spirits are always at war against the beautiful and the good.\u201d</p> <p>Players usually move to the centre when they are teenagers, often rescued from a life on the streets. Funded by Fifa\u2019s \u201cGoal\u201d programme to support football development, the centre was described as an opportunity to \u201clevel the international playing field\u201d by the former Fifa vice-president Jack Warner when established in 2001. Haiti\u2019s men\u2019s team confounded expectations by reaching the semi-finals of last year\u2019s Concacaf Gold Cup, but several witnesses have alleged to the Guardian the facility is in a dilapidated state after years of neglect despite having received up to $6m from Fifa\u2019s \u201cForward\u201d programme since 2016.</p> <p>\u201cThe last time I set foot there, I wanted to vomit,\u201d said a coach who used to work there regularly. \u201cIt is despicable.

The federation received millions, and they didn\u2019t even buy sheets.\u201d<br><br>The coach added: \u201cThis centre is a nightmare. Fifa\u2019s inspectors came, we thought they were going to say something, but it didn\u2019t happen. It\u2019s impossible. How can they say nothing? The young people have no medical monitoring, they eat the same thing every day \u2013 rice, pasta, bananas, chicken \u2013 drink water that you wouldn\u2019t ever drink and in the meantime the FA officials have their own doctor and organise banquets. It is obscene.\u201d</p> <p>In response to the allegations of neglect, the FHF\u2019s statement provided a list of new facilities that have been built at the centre, including an air-conditioned apartment block for senior players.</p> <p>\u201cThese are modern and more than decent facilities and all our foreign visitors come out amazed by the beauty of the place and the efforts made by our young people and our managers to keep it very correct,\u201d it said. \u201cWe are making a lot of effort to increase the self-esteem of our young people and their supervisors, otherwise they would not have been able to achieve such beautiful feats in the face of the countries of America and the Caribbean, clothing and other needs all year round.\u201d<strong><br></strong><br>A Fifa spokesman said the FHF was asked about allegations of sexual abuse at the centre following questions by the Guardian. The Fifa spokesman said the questions were raised by a member of staff from the office of V\u00e9ron Mosengo-Omba, Fifa\u2019s chief member associations officer.</p> <p>\u201cFifa was in contact recently with the Haiti Football Association as part of a general round of contacts with Fifa\u2019s 211 member associations in relation to the current coronavirus pandemic,\u201d said the Fifa spokesman. \u201cThe purpose of the call was to inquire about the situation of Haitian football as a consequence of the pandemic.

Considering that more than 700 workers at the Smithfield pork processing plant in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, have contracted Covid-19, it\u2019s hard to have confidence that meatpacking companies \u2013 which have already done such a poor job protecting their workers from the virus and which traditionally put huge emphasis on line speed and productivity \u2013 will rush to take the voluntary steps recommended to assure worker safety, steps that would cost money and slow down the plants\u2019 all-important line speed.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a guideline. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/28/business/economy/trump-meat-food-supply.html?action=click&amp;module=Spotlight&amp;pgtype=Homepage\">It\u2019s not a regulation.

It\u2019s all about production; the workers are forgotten, invisible cogs in Trump\u2019s political machinations. In his executive order he declares: \u201cIt is important that processors of beef, pork, and poultry in the food supply chain continue operating and fulfilling orders to ensure a continued supply of protein for Americans.\u201d</p> <p>It would have been nice if Trump had flown out to Iowa, Nebraska or South Dakota to meet with workers and explained the situation before making an announcement that could ultimately threaten the lives of thousands of meatpacking workers. That\u2019s what a president who truly cared about workers would have done. But that\u2019s not how Trump rolls.</p> <p>And even less would Trump would have wanted to be seen standing alongside meatpacking workers since such a high percentage of them are immigrants, often brown people from south of the border or black people from east Africa \u2013 people whom Trump has made his whipping boy. Trump doesn\u2019t mind using these workers as production fodder so long as it keeps meat on America\u2019s table. A shortage of meat \u2013 an all-American symbol and a macho symbol \u2013 could make Trump look bumbling and incompetent and serve as yet another reason for Americans to vote against him in November.</p> <p>Who ever imagined that putting sirloin and filet mignon on your table would be a national defense issue? Trump evidently did, because he invoked the Defense Production Act to order meat plants reopened. When past presidents invoked the Defense Production Act, it was usually to order corporations to do what they don\u2019t want to do \u2013 to rush to produce this item or that one. But here Trump has invoked the act to do what many corporations want \u2013 to have their plants reopened despite the safety worries of all those irritating governors and mayors and labor unions and workers.</p> <p>Perversely, the Trump White House is pushing hard to give meatpacking companies, and all of corporate America, a disincentive to act quickly and properly to protect their workers against the pandemic. Trump\u2019s administration is pressing Congress to enact an extraordinary liability shield that would insulate corporations from lawsuits their workers bring asserting that their employers were negligent in doing too little to protect them against Covid-19.</p> <p>If you\u2019re going to force plants to reopen and in effect force wary employees back to work \u2013 they\u2019ll lose their unemployment benefits if they don\u2019t go back to work at their reopened plants \u2013 shouldn\u2019t you have some weapon, whether an emergency Osha regulation or the threat of a lawsuit to ensure that corporations step up and do what they should do on safety during the worst pandemic in a century?</p> <p>It\u2019s also rather shocking that Trump, in this executive order, does this big favor for American consumers, farmers and corporations and does nothing to thank the workers whose lives would be put on the line. At a minimum, Trump should demand that the meatpacking companies or Congress ensure that these workers receive substantial hazard pay for work he has deemed essential to the national defense.

restaurants closed.</p> \n  <p>Myer had a 170.9 per cent year-on-year rise in entertainment sales driven by cooking appliances, with some of the best performing products being coffee machines and mixers.</p> \n  <p>Coles has seen a rise in purchases of vegetable, such potatoes, onions and carrots, while larger volumes of broccoli, lettuce and cabbage are being grown.</p> \n  <p>Woolworths said after disinfectants, bread mix was the second most popular purchase, with demand growing by 88 per cent between March 18 and April 14.</p> \n  <p>The supermarket chain also saw sales of dried herbs

But Trump\u2019s opposition<strong> </strong>appears based on a thinly veiled political calculus: the fewer Americans who vote, the better the political prospects for the Republican party.</p> <p>\u201cThey had things, levels of voting, that if you\u2019d ever agreed to it, you\u2019d never have a Republican elected in this country again,\u201d the president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/08/trump-mail-in-voting-2020-election\">said in March</a>, dismissing Democratic efforts to expand mail-in voting.</p> <p>That Republican estimation has been at the center of many of the hotly contested fights over voting rules in recent years. The party has generally favored restrictions on voting, such as voter ID, while Democrats have pushed to make it easier to cast a ballot.</p> <p>When it comes to vote by mail, however, the calculation is <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/us/politics/vote-by-mail.html\">unsupported by evidence</a>. Making it difficult to vote by mail could actually wind up hurting the Republican party.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s become an explosive issue because President Trump and some others at the top of Republican party, including [RNC chair] Ronna McDaniel, have made it an issue,\u201d said Rick Hasen, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine. \u201cThat puts Republicans in somewhat of a bind, because in many places in the country, vote by mail is a successful and safe way that Republicans get the vote out among their supporters.\u201d</p> <p>A Stanford study examining the switch to vote by mail in California, Washington and Utah found that it <a href=\"https://siepr.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/publications/20-015.pdf\">did not</a> benefit Democrats or Republicans, and only modestly increased turnout. Colorado <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/11/the-colorado-gop-mailed-it-inbut-won-112612\">elected</a> a Republican US senator the year after it switched to all vote-by-mail elections.

They dismissed plans to require states to automatically mail everyone a ballot, expand early voting and implement online voter registration. So far, the parties have agreed on allocating <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/us/coronavirus-voting-stimulus.html\">$400m</a> to states to help them prepare for elections, a fraction of the minimum $4bn <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/estimated-costs-covid-19-election-resiliency-measures\">experts say</a> is needed.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really disappointing that our political leaders aren\u2019t all working to ensure that every eligible American is able to cast a ballot that will count,\u201d said Myrna P\u00e9rez, director of the voting rights and elections program at the Brennan Center for Justice. \u201cThere used to be a point in time where having free and fair access to the ballot was a bipartisan issue.\u201d</p> <p>Currently, <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/all-mail-elections.aspx\">five US states</a> conduct their elections entirely by mail, while access to mail-in balloting varies widely in others. To run an election that relies heavily on vote by mail would require investing millions of dollars in ballots, staffing, new technology and messaging,<a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/estimated-costs-covid-19-election-resiliency-measures\"> according to</a> the Brennan Center.</p> <p>In Orange county, California, switching to vote by mail took three or four years of planning and cost at least $3m, said Neal Kelley, the county\u2019s registrar of voters. In Washington state, it took five years to transition to an all vote-by-mail system. Most US election offices \u2013 some with just one or two full-time employees \u2013 do not have the resources to make this transition in time for November without support.</p> <p>\u201cThe clock is ticking,\u201d said Amber McReynolds, the chief executive of the National Vote at Home Institute and Coalition, which advocates for vote by mail.</p> <p>In recent weeks, Democrats and voting groups have filed a slew of lawsuits \u2013 taking aim at restrictive state laws that require voters to give an excuse to vote by mail or have an in-person witness for their ballots. Advocates also want states to pick up the cost of postage on mail-in ballots and registration forms, calling it an unconstitutional poll tax.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There used to be a point in time where having free and fair access to the ballot was a bipartisan issue</p> <footer> <cite>Myrna P\u00e9rez</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But Republicans in Texas, Wisconsin, New Mexico and Nevada have opposed these lawsuits.

Election offices were overwhelmed with absentee ballot requests, and some voters never received ballots at all. Turnout didn\u2019t drop as severely as many projected, but voters in Milwaukee were forced to wait hours in line to vote.

There might be a delay in issuing ballots, and voters might get their ballots too late to vote, said Michael McDonald, a University of Florida political science professor. A nefarious actor could intentionally slow down the election process by making multiple ballot requests, forcing the election official to investigate (<a href=\"https://www.wbay.com/content/news/Green-Bay-City-Clerk-responds-to-spring-election-concerns--569845391.html\">one clerk</a> in Wisconsin reported a voter requested a ballot 11 times).</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re already seeing failure in a low-turnout election. It\u2019s not gonna get any better in a high-turnout election,\u201d McDonald said.</p> <p>More voting by mail will also slow down reporting of election results, since election officials would have to count ballots coming in after election night. This could leave room for a candidate to question the legitimacy of the results.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m concerned not only that a delay in reporting results will leave room for people to claim fraud, but also potentially for a candidate who\u2019s ahead in an early count to claim victory while the votes may shift as additional votes are counted,\u201d Hasen said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/23/coronavirus-fight-to-vote-us-voters\">'We can\u2019t afford to wait': coronavirus could shut out droves of new US voters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Breaking from Trump, some Republican officials have embraced vote by mail, though modestly.

Her government experience includes the US Department of Homeland Security and the White House management and budget office, in George W Bush\u2019s administration. Before Branch\u2019s federal appellate confirmation, she was a judge on Georgia\u2019s court of appeals, her 11th circuit biography <a href=\"http://www.ca11.uscourts.gov/judges/hon-elizabeth-l-branch\">says.</a></p> <h2><strong>John K Bush</strong></h2> <h2><strong>Sixth </strong><strong>circuit </strong><strong>court of </strong><strong>appeals</strong></h2> <ul> <li><p><strong>Eastern and </strong><strong>western </strong><strong>districts of Kentucky; </strong><strong>eastern and </strong><strong>western </strong><strong>districts of Michigan; </strong><strong>northern and </strong><strong>southern </strong><strong>districts of Ohio; </strong><strong>eastern, </strong><strong>middle</strong><strong> and </strong><strong>western </strong><strong>districts of Tennessee.</strong></p></li> </ul> <p>Since ascending to the appellate bench, Bush\u2019s decisions have indicated a pattern with the potential to undermine oversight and civil rights, progressive court-watchers contend. Bush, 55, and Judge Joan Larsen, who is also a Trump appointee, upheld the dismissal of a lawsuit that involved an airline employee who was terminated after complaining to company higher-ups about safety concerns involving her supervisor.</p> <p>The former employee, a technical writer whose work involved operations and maintenance manuals for pilots, claimed that she was protected from the firing despite being an \u201cat will\u201d worker. She cited an Ohio law that prohibits firing people if doing so is in violation of public policy. She contended that she was protected under this law, arguing that public safety was public policy, says PFAW.</p> <p>In his January opinion, Bush wrote that she \u201cfailed to provide clear notice \u2026 that she was invoking a governmental policy in her complaints\u201d, meaning her \u201cdismissal did not jeopardize any public policy, and the facts of her case do not trigger Ohio\u2019s public-policy exception to the at-will employment doctrine\u201d.</p> <p>In July, Bush voted to affirm the dismissal without trial of a free speech case. In that lawsuit, protesters had claimed that they were wrongfully arrested while trying to protest against the Kentucky Farm Bureau for alleged discriminatory policies.</p> <p>\u201cBush is one of the earliest judges that was put on the court by Trump and therefore he has one of the longest records \u2013 and his record is broad and deep and bad in a wide variety of cases,\u201d Mincberg said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to find a single area where Bush hasn\u2019t written a decision, or dissent, that would take the law backwards.\u201d</p> <p>Before Bush\u2019s confirmation, Buzzfeed <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/zoetillman/one-of-trumps-judicial-nominees-blogged-under-a-pen-name#.yf0mEWZK5\">reported</a> that he had likened abortion to slavery in a pseudonymous blogpost, writing that they were the \u201ctwo greatest tragedies in our country\u201d.

  "<p>The Trump administration has ratcheted up its efforts amid the coronavirus pandemic to overhaul and overturn Obama-era environmental regulations and increase industry access to public lands.</p> <p>The secretary of the interior, David Bernhardt, has sped efforts to drill, mine and cut timber on fragile western landscapes. Meanwhile, the EPA, headed by the former coal lobbyist Andrew Wheeler, has weakened critical environmental laws and announced in March that it would cease oversight of the nation\u2019s polluters during the Covid-19 crisis.</p> <p>The rollbacks appear to follow a playbook put forth by influential conservative thinktanks, urging the White House to use the pandemic as justification for curtailing, or eliminating, environmental rules and oversight. President Trump should have \u201cthe ability to suspend costly regulations without extensive process\u201d, according to a recent <a href=\"https://dinosaur-lily-78e9.squarespace.com/recommendations\">report</a> by the Heritage Foundation.</p> <p> Critics, such as Melyssa Watson, executive director of the Wilderness Society, accuse the administration of using the pandemic as a smokescreen to further its pro-industry agenda. \u201cFrom rolling back EPA\u2019s pollution standards, to pushing for more oil and gas drilling and stifling the public review process, the federal government is fast-tracking rollbacks that deserve public scrutiny,\u201d she said.</p> <p>While millions of acres of public lands across the country have been shuttered to visitors, they remain open to oil and gas companies. And despite plummeting oil prices, the Bureau of Land Management has announced no plans to cancel, or even scale back, upcoming auctions that would make hundreds of thousands of acres of public lands across the western US available to energy companies.</p> <p>One of the most controversial sales would offer up 150,000 acres in southern Utah to energy companies. Some of the parcels are located within a half-mile of Canyonlands national park. The bureau did not respond to requests for comment.</p> <p>Environmentalists, however, say that the push to drill near the iconic red rock landscapes of Arches and Canyonlands is not only destructive but also unnecessary in light of an oil glut that has swamped storage capacity, driving oil prices last week into negative territory for the first time in history.</p> <p>\u201cThe idea that it would be \u2018critical\u2019 work to speed up oil production on public lands while the planet drowns in oil tells you all you\u2019d ever want to know about the corruption, both intellectual and actual, of the Trump administration,\u201d said the climate activist and author Bill McKibben.</p> <p>In addition to ramping up oil and gas development on public lands, the Department of Energy announced plans last week to \u201crevitalize\u201d the US uranium mining and processing industry. Such a scheme, say environmentalists, puts uranium-rich Grand Canyon national park and Bears Ears national monument at extreme risk.</p> <p>\u201cEnriching special interests with taxpayer resources so they can plunder national treasures like Bears Ears and the Grand Canyon will harm our land, water and public health,\u201d said America Fitzpatrick, a spokeswoman for the Wilderness Society. \u201cTo do so in the face of a global pandemic is an abuse of public trust.\u201d</p> <p>The water demands of the uranium industry are significant. Depending on the method of extraction, a mine can require hundreds, even thousands, of gallons per minute. Those requirements are particularly onerous considering that the largest uranium deposits are found in some of the most water-starved parts of the country.</p> <p>Another rule change takes aim at the western forests. In March, the BLM announced a proposal that would allow the BLM and US Forest Service to destroy large parcels of pi\u00f1on and juniper forests across the western US with minimal environmental review. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"125d9168c91e8db01244819b904b172b38be15d0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/125d9168c91e8db01244819b904b172b38be15d0/0_166_5000_3002/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Changes to EPA regulations could lead to a dramatic increase in carbon emissions.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Changes to EPA fuel efficiency standards could lead to a dramatic increase in carbon emissions.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00c9tienne Laurent/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Other recent Trump administration actions threaten air and water quality and herald a drastic increase in carbon emissions. At the end of March, the Department of Transportation and Environmental Protection Agency announced plans to roll back Obama-era automobile fuel efficiency standards that would have increased the average fuel efficiency of the American vehicle fleet by more than 6 miles per gallon. Referred to by the EPA as \u201cthe largest deregulatory initiative of this administration\u201d, the reduction in fuel efficiency standards will result in close to a billion additional tons of carbon emissions per year.</p> <p>Days earlier, the EPA announced that it would suspend enforcement of environmental regulations during the Covid-19 outbreak, allowing industrial firms \u2013 from oil refineries to small manufacturers \u2013 to self-monitor and avoid penalties for violations if they can prove that those violations somehow resulted from the pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cThe Covid-19 pandemic is a nationwide phenomenon,\u201d the EPA administrator, Andrew Wheeler, wrote in a letter to Congress. \u201cDiverting EPA staff time to respond to individual questions about routine monitoring and reporting requirements would hinder EPA\u2019s ability to focus on continued protection of human health and the environment.\u201d</p> <p>Others see it differently: \u201cThis is an open license to pollute,\u201d said the former EPA administrator and current Natural Resources Defense Council president Gina McCarthy. \u201cThe administration \u2026 is taking advantage of an unprecedented public health crisis to do favors for polluters that threaten public health.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 1 May 2020.

She told the paper that she was asked to serve drinks at an event because Biden liked her legs and, when she refused, was sidelined and eventually pushed out of his employ. </p> <p>A year later, in an interview with the leftwing podcast commentator Katie Halper, Reade alleged that Biden had pinned her against a wall and digitally penetrated her in the basement of a Capitol Hill office in the spring of 1993. She said she had not come forward with the allegation sooner because she was scared of the backlash and was still grappling with what had happened to her.</p> <p>Reade said she filed a report in the Senate and claims she was forced out of his office after complaining to her supervisors, a charge disputed by several former Biden aides but corroborated in part by people she said she told at the time and in the years after.</p> <p>In an interview this week with the conservative website the Daily Caller, Reade called on Biden to release any documents related to her employment.

The group wants to force the state to immediately remove voters it suspects have moved from the voter rolls.

But now that the election had passed, Kelly said he saw no ethical obstacle preventing him from hearing the case. \u201cIn light of the fact that this case cannot now affect any election in which I would be a candidate while the case is being decided, there is no ethical bar to my participation in the consideration of the petition for review or the merits of the case if the petition for review is granted,\u201d Kelly wrote in a Wednesday order. Karofsky\u2019s 10-year term begins on 1 August, and she will narrow the conservative majority on the court from 5-2 to 4-3.</p> \n  <p>Stephen Gillers, a law professor at NYU and an expert on judicial ethics, said he did not see anything improper in Kelly\u2019s decision. \u201cIt is rare but not unheard of for a judge who recuses to unrecuse,\u201d he wrote in an email. \u201cJudge Kelly is still a judge and the matter is before his court.

Before it was blocked by a lower court in 2016, it prevented around 30,000 people from registering to vote. </p> \n  <p><strong>Kris Kobach</strong>, the former Kansas secretary of state nationally known for his anti-immigrant views and support of voting restrictions, championed the measure, saying it was necessary to prevent non-citizens from registering to vote in his state.

The court noted that \u201cat most\u201d 39 non-citizens had registered to vote in Kansas over the last 19 years. Many of those cases, the court be explained by administrative error, and did not justify the burden placed on 30,000 voters. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/rickhasen/status/1255520426798862339\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Whoa!
