  "<p>Donald Trump on Friday signed into law the largest economic stimulus package in US history, a bill designed to rush federal assistance to workers and businesses as the coronavirus pandemic devastates the economy and healthcare system.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/27/coronavirus-live-news-update-us-infections-outnumber-china-uk-deaths-europe-global-cases-number-500000-latest-updates\">Coronavirus live news: Spain records highest single-day death toll and withdraws 'inaccurate' testing kits</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Congress acted with unprecedented speed and bipartisanship in a moment of national crisis, negotiating the $2.2tn bill over several days in an urgent effort.</p> <p>\u201cWe got hit by the invisible enemy and we got hit hard,\u201d the president said at a White House signing ceremony.</p> <p>Remarking on the sheer scale of the package, he said: \u201cI never signed anything with a \u2018T\u2019 on it.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier, the House approved the package by voice vote, after leaders in both parties united to overcome a Republican\u2019s last-minute attempt to delay its passage.</p> <p>Thomas Massie, of Kentucky, attempted to use a procedural maneuver to force a recorded vote and require lawmakers to vote individually. He was overruled by a unanimous show of force, House leaders seeking to avoid a recorded vote so lawmakers would not be forced to return to Washington. The last-minute drama brought strong bipartisan criticism of Massie, from the White House down.</p> <p>The legislation will deliver one-time direct payments of $1,200 to most taxpayers and substantially enhance unemployment benefits. The measure also creates a $500bn lending program for businesses, cities and states and a $367bn fund for small businesses.</p> <p>The US has surpassed China and Italy in the number of confirmed coronavirus cases and a record 3.3 million Americans have filed for unemployment. The Senate approved the measure in an extraordinary 96-0 vote on Wednesday night.</p> <p>Earlier on Friday, Trump berated Massie, calling him a \u201cthird rate Grandstander\u201d and \u201ca disaster for America, and for the Great State of Kentucky!\u201d </p> <p>\u201cHe just wants the publicity. He can\u2019t stop it, only delay, which is both dangerous \u2026 &amp; costly,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cWorkers &amp; small businesses need money now in order to survive.\u201d</p> <p>Trump also heaped praise on former secretary of state John Kerry, a frequent target of his wrath, for a tweet claiming Massie \u201ctested positive for being an asshole\u201d.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RepThomasMassie/status/1243565641858191361\">series of 11 tweets</a>, Massie, a libertarian member of the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus, explained his rationale.</p> <p>\u201cThe constitution requires that a quorum of members be present to conduct business in the House,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cRight now, millions of essential, working-class Americans are still required to go to work during this pandemic such as manufacturing line workers, healthcare professionals, pilots, grocery clerks, cooks/chefs, delivery drivers, auto mechanics and janitors (to name just a few). Is it too much to ask that the House do its job, just like the Senate did?\u201d</p> <p>A memo from the sergeant-at-arms, Paul Irving, and the House attending physician, Brian Monahan, suggested members of the chamber whose ages span from 30 to 86 consider staying home. In bolded and underlined text, they wrote: \u201cMembers should use extreme care and deliberation when making the determination to travel to Washington DC.</p> <p>Earlier, Massie dismissed concerns about legislators having to fly back to Washington, noting he chose to drive and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alanhe/status/1243181431783899136\">suggesting</a> stranded colleagues might \u201chitch a ride with a trucker\u201d.</p> <p>His colleagues were furious. At least two House members have tested positive for coronavirus, while a number of others are awaiting test results or in quarantine after coming into contact with an infected person.</p> <p>\u201cIf you intend to delay passage of the coronavirus relief bill tomorrow morning, please advise your 428 colleagues RIGHT NOW so we can book flights and expend [more than] $200,000 in taxpayer money to counter your principled but terribly misguided stunt,\u201d the Minnesota congressman Dean Phillips tweeted late on Thursday.</p> <p>The Republican Fred Upton, of Michigan, drove nearly 10 hours to \u201chelp get this thing over the finish line\u201d. Several lawmakers from western states said they would fly in.</p> <p>\u201cGetting on a red eye,\u201d the California congressman Mike Levin tweeted. \u201cToo much is at stake and Americans can\u2019t afford to wait any longer.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI am jumping on the red eye tonight,\u201d the Arizona congressman Ruben Gallego, a Democrat, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RubenGallego/status/1243358229226119170?s=20\">tweeted</a>. \u201cThanks Massie.\u201d</p> <p>\u200bAs the crisis deepened across the country, with the US death toll rising to more than 1,200, lawmakers shared a sense of urgency. In more than three hours of debate, which began on Friday morning and was split evenly between Republicans and Democrats, lawmakers made impassioned pleas for their communities.</p> <p>Congresswoman Haley Steves, a freshman Democrat from Michigan who <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HaleyLive/status/1243032265250258950\">drove through the night </a>to get to Washington,wore pink latex gloves to emphasize the risks faced by medical professionals combatting the virus.</p> <p>When her speaking time had expired, Stevens, whose district outside Detroit has been devastated by the spread of the disease and the economic fallout, began to shout over the chairman as he ruled her out of order.</p> <p>\u201cI rise for every American who is scared right now,\u200b\u201d she shouted, holding her gloves in the air as the presiding chair banged the gavel and other members joined the fray.</p> <p>\u201cYou will see darkness! You will be pushed,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u200bMoments later the New York congresswoman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/alexandria-ocasio-cortez\">Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez</a>, whose state is at the center of the outbreak, delivered an impassioned speech on the shortcomings of the bill.</p> <p>\u201cWhat did the Senate majority fight for?\u200b\u201d she said, her arms punching the air in fury.\u200b \u201cOne of the largest corporate bailouts with as few strings as possible in American history.

He said: \u201cWhen the president says New York doesn\u2019t need 30,000 ventilators, he is not looking at this astronomical growth, and a ventilator means you live or die. We have in New York City 2,500 ventilators in the last week or so. The state needs 30,000, [of which] the city needs 15,000.

Which means \u201cthe answer to the riddle \u2018How do you get the president to go to a meeting?\u2019\u201d said Meyers, \u201cis a fucking pandemic\u201d.</p>",
  "<p>The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has suspended its enforcement of some environmental laws during the ongoing coronavirus outbreak.</p> <p>In an extraordinary move that has stunned former EPA officials, <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2020-03/documents/oecamemooncovid19implications.pdf\">the Trump administration said</a> it will not expect compliance with the routine monitoring and reporting of pollution and won\u2019t pursue penalties for breaking these rules.</p> <p>Polluters will be able to ignore some environmental laws as long as they can claim in some way these violations were caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. In the event of an imminent threat to public health, the EPA will defer to the states and \u201cconsider the circumstances\u201d over whether it should intervene.</p> <p>There is no end date set for this dropping of enforcement.</p> <p>Andrew Wheeler, administrator of the EPA, said that coronavirus had made it difficult for businesses to protect workers and the public while adhering to clean air and water rules.</p> <p>\u201cThis temporary policy is designed to provide enforcement discretion under the current, extraordinary conditions, while ensuring facility operations continue to protect human health and the environment,\u201d Wheeler said.</p> <p>The new stance has caused uproar among former EPA officials and environmental groups who warn that the sweeping will pose a further risk to public health amid the pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cEPA should never relinquish its right and its obligation to act immediately and decisively when there is threat to public health, no matter what the reason is,\u201d said Cynthia Giles, who was head of EPA enforcement during the Obama administration.</p> <p>\u201cI am not aware of any instance when EPA ever relinquished this fundamental authority as it does in this memo. This memo amounts to a nationwide moratorium on enforcing the nation\u2019s environmental laws and is an abdication of EPA\u2019s responsibility to protect the public.\u201d</p> <p>A letter sent to the EPA by Giles and a number of other environmental advocates states that while it may be \u201creasonable in limited circumstances\u201d to relax certain enforcement during the crisis, the blanket waiver of environmental requirements poses a danger to the American public.</p> <p>There is particular concern over air pollution emitted by industrial facilities, which are predominantly located in communities with large numbers of low-income people and people of color. Covid-19 attacks the respiratory system, with its spread causing states to scramble for more ventilators to prevent thousands of infected people from dying.</p> <p>The air pollution that industrial plants will not have to monitor damages the respiratory system, which is especially dangerous for already at-risk populations who may also become infected with Covid-19, which attacks the lungs.</p> <p>\u201cExcusing the potential release of excess toxic air pollutants and other pollution that exacerbates asthma, breathing difficulty and cardiovascular problems in the midst of a pandemic that can cause respiratory failure is irresponsible from a public health perspective,\u201d the letter states.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not about reporting and paperwork,\u201d said Eric Schaeffer, executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re flying blind because you\u2019re not monitoring for pollution and the public\u2019s flying blind because you\u2019re not reporting it, a lot of problems that come to light when you do those things are going to stay hidden,\u201d Schaeffer said.</p> <p>In one example, oil refineries will not be compelled to report on and reduce their carcinogenic <a href=\"https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fbusiness%2F2020%2Ffeb%2F06%2Fus-oil-refineries-exceeding-limits-for-cancer-causing-benzene-report-finds\">benzene emissions</a>. Ten refineries, most of them in Texas, have already been exceeding limits.</p> <p>The relaxation of environmental laws follows lobbying from the American Petroleum Institute, an oil and gas industry group, which sent the EPA a letter this week calling for the suspension of rules requiring repair of leaky equipment as well as monitoring of pollution.</p> <p>The EPA\u2019s move goes even further than this request, although the regulator said it expects businesses will comply with laws \u201cwhere reasonably practicable\u201d and that it will not tolerate flagrant, intentional breaches of the law.</p> <p>However, Michael Brune, executive director of Sierra Club, indicated that the move may be challenged in the courts. \u201cWhile there may be no limit to the lengths Trump and Wheeler are willing to go for corporate polluters, there is a limit to what the public will allow,\u201d Brune said. \u201cThis illegal and reckless action will not go unchecked.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This story was amended on 8 May 2020 to clarify that it is only the enforcement of some environmental laws that has been suspended.</p>",
  "<p>Speaking before the largest inauguration crowd in human history, Donald Trump made a bold prediction.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/mar/27/coronavirus-us-live-news-trump-stimulus-vote-house-thomas-massie-latest-updates\">Coronavirus US live: single Republican may stall $2.2tn stimulus package</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cFrom this day forward, a new vision will govern our land. From this moment on, it\u2019s going to be America First,\u201d he declared.</p> <p>\u201cI will fight for you with every breath in my body \u2013 and I will never, ever let you down. America will start winning again, winning like never before.\u201d</p> <p>And so it came to pass that America is indeed winning like never before. First among nations, to be sure. With all the new vision that an ostrich has while examining the sand from below.</p> <p>The news that Donald Trump\u2019s America is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/coronavirus-outbreak-us-latest-trump\">first</a> in the world for coronavirus cases should give nobody any pleasure. The fact that the nation passed this grim milestone on the same day it <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/26/us-unemployment-rate-coronavirus-business\">reported</a> a record number of unemployment claims \u2013 3.3 million in just one week \u2013 underscores the superlative nature of this presidency.</p> <p>He represents the greatest, the biggest, and the most tremendous failure of leadership in living memory. He has made America great again in ways nobody could ever imagine or conceive.</p> <p>How did Trump mark this date which will live in infamy? By praising himself, of course. If he had been president at the time of Pearl Harbor, he would have claimed that the bombing was just confirmation that he had built the world\u2019s greatest navy.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a tribute to the amount of testing that we\u2019re doing,\u201d he said on Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019re doing tremendous testing, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019re not able to tell what China is testing or not testing. I think that\u2019s a little hard.\u201d</p> <p>To be honest, it\u2019s a little hard to tell what\u2019s happening here too. As of Thursday evening, there have been 519,000 tests <a href=\"https://covidtracking.com/data/\">performed</a> in the United States, among a population of 327 million. That\u2019s 0.15% of all Americans. In South Korea, with a population one-sixth of the size, they have <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/25/politics/coronavirus-testing-trump-south-korea-fact-check/index.html\">performed</a> more than 357,000 tests.</p> <p>Overtaking South Korea in total tests was of course a reason to celebrate in Trump\u2019s very small book. It was also a reason to lie.</p> <p>\u201cJust reported that the United States has done far more \u2018testing\u2019 than any other nation, by far!\u201d he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1242824631230308353\">tweeted</a>. \u201cIn fact, over an eight day span, the United States now does more testing than what South Korea (which has been a very successful tester) does over an eight week span. Great job!\u201d</p> <p>Yes, great job! Totally awesome. We\u2019re only six times behind where we should be on the South Korean scale of what Trump considers to be \u201ctesting\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s not entirely clear that anyone has \u201ctested\u201d Trump with a multiple-choice quiz about this pandemic and how to end it. Lobbed an obvious question about the tests on Wednesday, he spun his tale of failure into a Technicolor tapestry of dopey lies and lazy delusions.</p> <p>\u201cWe have tested, by far, more than anybody. We\u2019re testing more than anybody right now. There\u2019s nobody even close. And our tests are the best tests. They\u2019re the most accurate tests,\u201d he riffed, as if his words had uncoupled themselves from the gravitational pull of meaning and begun floating into the upper reaches of his empty skull.</p> <p>\u201cBut if you\u2019re saying we\u2019re going to test 350 million people,\u201d he continued, \u201cI disagree with it. We can go to certain states \u2013 I could name them now, but I\u2019m not going to do that \u2013 but we can go to certain states right now. They have virtually no problem or a very small problem.\u201d</p> <p>There is only one place where that claim is true, and that would be the state of denial: Donald Trump\u2019s home state when the going gets tough.</p> <p>For those looking at far less important numbers, like Trump\u2019s rising approval ratings or the yo-yo stock market, these are confusing times. How can anything be rising when we have such catastrophically incompetent leadership?</p> <p>This is the crackerjack team that is dithering over a $1bn deal to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/us/politics/coronavirus-ventilators-trump.html?action=click&amp;module=Spotlight&amp;pgtype=Homepage\">produce</a> 80,000 critically needed ventilators while waving through a $2tn stimulus bill that includes $50bn for airlines. Flying may be important to the economy, but breathing is surely worth one-fiftieth of the support.</p> <p>Trump would dearly love to tell a story about Democratic states suffering while Republican ones are virus-free. But Florida complicates that picture, and the pesky numbers show the virus has reached every state in the union. Even with the fractional testing that we\u2019re doing.</p> <p>Like every con artist, Trump knows when the mark has moved on. You can fool some of the people all of the time, especially if they watch Fox News. You can even fool a plurality of the people at election time, with a billion dollars of Facebook disinformation. But you can\u2019t fool all of the people, especially at a time of pandemic and recession.</p> <p>So his numbers are sliding <a href=\"https://navigatorresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Public-Opinion-on-Coronavirus-Navigator-Daily-03.26.20.pdf\">downwards</a> just as surely as the virus numbers are climbing upwards.

We will bring back our wealth. And we will bring back our dreams.\u201d</p> <p>Thanks for all that. The jobs and wealth are evaporating before our eyes. The virus didn\u2019t respect the borders.

He waded across a river and walked through Luxembourg and Belgium into Holland. A kindly Dutch policeman, concerned the boy would be turned away without a visa, smuggled him back into Germany.</p> <p>Within a fortnight, in July 1939, G\u00fcnter boarded a train to safety. Their farewell at Cologne station was the last time he saw his parents. He received letters from them via the Red Cross, until his mother wrote in February 1942 to say they were being \u201cresettled\u201d in Poland. </p> <p>In Britain, G\u00fcnter was given a home in Birmingham by the Free family, and resumed his education near their North Wales holiday home. He then attended Yardley grammar, a Birmingham school evacuated to Lydney, Gloucestershire, where he lived with another family, the Allsopps. </p> <p>He was offered a place to study chemistry at Birmingham University, but turned it down to volunteer for the British army. He was advised to change his name, and chose Sterling after the currency, but the officer wrote Stirling; his comrades called him Joe. He served in the Royal Army Ordnance Corps, then the Educational Corps, and met Jean Skitmore, a Norfolk woman serving in the Auxiliary Territorial Service. They married in 1946.</p> <p>Settling in Norfolk, in Attleborough and then Norwich, he worked in accounts for a brush factory. In 1950 he became the full-time Labour party secretary-agent for the Central Norfolk constituency and then in Norwich; he was a councillor from 1958 to 1961. A colleague asked him to organise a Rhineland holiday for Labour Club members and after much research, and a poignant family holiday to his old haunts, he led a 30-strong party to Germany in 1955. Two years later he began operating trips abroad and Stirling Holidays was born.</p> <p>After retiring at 73, he indulged a love of classical music at concerts and was a volunteer visitor at the elderly lifers unit in Norwich prison, where he played scrabble with Ronnie Biggs. He was also a leading light in the Lions Club for more than 50 years, giving support to good causes and forging links of friendship around the world. </p> <p>Jean died in 2002. Joe is survived by his children, Jane, Ian, Martin and Johanna, six grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/ridley-scott\">Ridley Scott</a>, the director of Alien, Blade Runner, Gladiator and The Martian, has taken aim at Donald Trump and Boris Johnson over their leadership during the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus pandemic</a>.</p> <p>Speaking to Variety from his home in Los Angeles, Scott, 82, said he thought \u201cthis orange-headed fellow that\u2019s running us\u201d is \u201ca nutcase, isn\u2019t he\u201d?</p> <p>Looking more widely, Scott suggested that half the world\u2019s leaders were \u201cidiots\u201d and the other half \u201cdespots\u201d. \u201cThere are very few worthwhile ones,\u201d he said. \u201cIf anyone has half a brain, they wouldn\u2019t want to go into politics anyway, right?\u201d</p> <p>Scott, who was born shortly before the second world war, suggested that countries, the UK in particular, should reintroduce rationing because \u201cpeople are buying so much food and then the food is rotting\u201d.</p> <p>He continued: \u201cJesus, Boris, get out your thinking cap, cos what we\u2019re now talking on is an iPhone: a perfect coupon distributor to limit what you can buy each time you go to the shops.

  "<p>Should we reopen the US economy in a couple of weeks? Both sides of the argument have their merits. We <em>need</em> to put US workers <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/24/politics/trump-coronavirus-economy-open-health/index.html\">back to work</a> as quickly as possible to slow the economic damage inflicted by mass physical distancing policies.

Yet our economy today is dramatically different from that of the early 20th century.</p> <p>American goods and services are reliant on the output of other countries around the world, whose production is in turn dependent on the output of still other nations, and so on. We can\u2019t successfully put American companies back to work unless other countries simultaneously do the same with their domestic industries.</p> <p>Production of US automobiles, for example, simply won\u2019t be feasible until <a href=\"https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/2020/03/06/coronavirus-covid-auto-parts-supply-chain-china/4964022002/\">nations that produce required components</a> also reopen. And if US automakers can\u2019t source the materials they need for domestic production, related service companies \u2013 like marketing firms \u2013 won\u2019t have much work, either. If marketing companies have little to market, online advertising giants such as Google and Facebook will in turn see limited revenues.</p> <p>Our global economy is remarkably <a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/sti/ind/global-value-chains.htm\">interconnected</a>. Pull out an important thread, and the whole tapestry of our production system <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-20/a-covid-19-supply-chain-shock-born-in-china-is-going-global\">unravels</a>.</p> <p>This economic interdependence necessitates all parts working in harmony. Unfortunately, the pandemic is asynchronous \u2013 it hits countries at different times with different rates of growth and severity. While China is <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-autos-parts/as-one-of-chinas-detroits-reopens-worlds-automakers-worry-about-disruptions-idUSKBN20V14J\">reopening</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-52024239\">India</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/opinion/coronavirus-trump-lockdown.html\">US</a> are shuttering. If portions of Chinese production require unavailable intermediate goods from India or the US, such production won\u2019t be possible. Even if China can produce items for export, if their normal buyers in the US are closed, who will they sell to? And what happens when China \u2013 still <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/chinas-premier-warns-local-officials-not-to-cover-up-new-covid-19-cases-as-hubei-reopens\">lacking herd immunity</a> \u2013 needs to close its economy again right when India or the US are looking to reopen and use Chinese inputs?</p> <p>The staggered nature of the virus outbreak coupled with worldwide production presents a <a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2020/simchi-levi-supply-chain-covid-19-0325\">remarkable</a> \u2013 and quite possibly insurmountable \u2013 global coordination problem. Globalized on-demand supply chains simply aren\u2019t well suited for a worldwide pandemic.</p> <h2><strong>Political hurdles</strong></h2> <p>The economic argument for reopening US production assumes that it would be broadly socially acceptable to sacrifice the lives of Americans to save our economy \u2013 and that politicians will therefore be willing to pursue it. We suspect, to the contrary, that premature reopening will soon be revealed as political suicide.</p> <p>Once the <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-12/grim-toll-of-virus-deaths-will-get-worse-even-as-outbreak-wanes\">lag in deaths</a> catches up to the exponentially increasing number of cases in the US, <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2020/03/24/covid-19-italian-priest-who-donated-his-ventilator-has-reportedly-died/2906351001/\">myriad</a> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/us/coronavirus-deaths-united-states.html\">heart-wrenching</a> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/nyregion/coronavirus-death-brooklyn-school-principal.html\">stories</a> of <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/coronavirus-georgia-mom-who-worked-hospital-found-dead-home-her-n1168386\">the</a> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/uk-woman-21-with-no-health-issues-dies-from-covid-19-family-say\">lives</a> of those lost will ensue.

Yet its speed and severity take many by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/20/coronavirus-italy-lessons-countries-crisis-information\">surprise</a> as it <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/23/820009377/italy-witnesses-relentless-rise-in-covid-19-deaths\">rapidly</a> runs through communities. The marked difference between expectations and reality exacts a heavy psychological toll.</p> <p>Once the coronavirus touches citizens\u2019 lives, they are quite <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bill-gates-on-trump-call-for-quick-end-to-lockdown-its-tough-to-tell-people-keep-going-to-restaurants-go-buy-new-houses-ignore-that-pile-of-bodies-over-in-the-corner-2020-03-24\">unlikely</a> to immediately switch back into status-quo behavior. Even if officials were to remove restrictions on movement and social gatherings, we suspect most people will continue to limit non-essential outings.

If you knew coronavirus was still ravaging your city, would you head out to the barber shop or go to a concert?</p> <p>Many normal activities, from the enjoyable to the mundane, now produce some level of anxiety. That association won\u2019t be undone overnight, and fear is a remarkably powerful deterrent to economic activity.</p> <p>So, should we restart our economy while the virus is still rapidly spreading?

Governors, the typically aloof top state officials, are currently some of the most reliable sources of information on confirmed coronavirus cases and updates on medical supplies in response to the virus.</p> <p>\u201cThe governors are acting in a way governors traditionally act, it just so happens that governors have more of an audience for it now,\u201d said the former Delaware governor Jack Markell, a Democrat.</p> <p>Responses to the pandemic have varied from state to state. Partially because not every governor has the same amount of authority. Some governors can activate the national guard or order schools closed essentially on their own. Others have had to take legislative routes or make other bureaucratic moves.</p> <p>There have been some markings of a deeper ideological divide to responding to the virus. Some Republican governors, such as Arizona\u2019s Doug Ducey, have loudly touted new partnerships with private business to fight the pandemic while some Democrats have leaned more on executive orders to slow the outbreak down.</p> <p>Governors have also received more attention from Donald Trump than they otherwise would.</p> <p>New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, has received both praise and criticism from the president. Cuomo has regularly been in touch with Trump but at times criticized the federal government\u2019s help to his state. Illinois\u2019 governor, JB Pritzker, and Michigan\u2019s governor, Gretchen Whitmer, , have gotten into public spats with Trump on Twitter.</p> <p>At the same time, Republican and Democratic governors are learning how to shape their public comments under the intense scrutiny of a TV-obsessed president eager to return praise and respond to criticism with more criticism. It is a tough tightrope to walk and in the face of dealing with a pandemic comes with life-or-death high stakes.</p> <p>California\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, usually an eager critic of the president, has repeatedly praised the Trump administration for how it has responded to the crisis. Newsom has praised Trump for the president\u2019s \u201cfocus on treatments\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"64387f0b348e5060da7753c1a8de9c6afa857da7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/64387f0b348e5060da7753c1a8de9c6afa857da7/0_0_4354_2613/1000.jpg\" alt=\"California\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, speaks in Rancho Cordova, California, on 23 March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">California\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom, speaks in Rancho Cordova, California, on 23 March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rich Pedroncelli/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Conversely, Pritzker found himself in a Twitter feud with the president where, at one point, the top Illinois Democrat called Trump a carnival barker. Trump has also fumed at Washington\u2019s governor, Jay Inslee, calling him a \u201csnake\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a two-way street,\u201d Trump said of dealing with governors during a Fox News town hall. \u201cThey have to treat us well.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s been an increased level of coordination and note trading between governors as well. Usually, each governor is mostly siloed off from even their closest neighbors. But conference calls with the White House or one-on-one calls and joint statements between governors have become more regular.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019ve just started texting and calling each other as we look to [ask] \u2018Why did you do this?

What was the thought process behind this?\u2019 as we\u2019re trying to make decisions for our own states.\u201d</p> <p>The National Governors Association, the nonpartisan umbrella organization, has helped to facilitate conference calls between the governors and a White House. The Democratic Governors Association and the Republican Governors Association have been sharing information about what governors have been doing on the pandemic with their members.</p> <p>A call between Florida\u2019s governor, Ron DeSantis, and Georgia\u2019s governor, Brian Kemp, on Covid-19 was listed on DeSantis\u2019s public schedule in mid-March. Whitmer, a Democrat, and Ohio\u2019s Republican governor, Mike DeWine issued a joint statement urging Trump to take extra steps to protect the auto industry from financial ruin during the pandemic and resulting economic collapse.</p> <p>The White House has been interacting with governors regularly. South Dakota\u2019s governor, Kristi Noem, talked extensively with Larry Kudlow, the director of Trump\u2019s National Economic Council, on Wednesday. On Thursday the Trump administration <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/mar/26/coronavirus-us-live-house-vote-2tn-stimulus-package-bill-senate-news-updates-trump?page=with:block-5e7ceffd8f081e5eda237764#block-5e7ceffd8f081e5eda237764\">released a letter sent to every governor</a> detailing how it planned to release new guidelines for classifying counties as \u201chigh-risk\u201d, \u201cmedium-risk\u201d or \u201clow-risk\u201d on the coronavirus. The Trump administration has regularly held conference calls with governors.</p> <p>According to a Republican aide to one of the governors on those calls, oftentimes the calls start out with \u201cVice-President Mike Pence giving an update on what the latest is that\u2019s going on on a federal level\u201d.

  "<p>Chinese president Xi Jinping has called on Donald Trump to take \u201csubstantive actions\u201d to improve relations between the two countries, as China prepared to shut its borders to foreign arrivals amid fears of infections coming from abroad.</p> \n<p>On Friday, Trump and Chinese president Xi Jinping held a phone call about the coronavirus outbreak in an attempt to repair strained relations, following weeks of traded barbs over the virus. According to state media, Xi told Trump in a phone call on Friday that US-China relations had reached an \u201cimportant juncture\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cWorking together brings both sides benefits, fighting hurts both. Cooperation is the only choice,\u201d he said.

Chinese diplomats have in turn pushed the idea that the virus, which emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, originated in the US.<strong><br><br></strong>Xi also said he hoped the US would take \u201ceffective measures\u201d to safeguard the lives of Chinese citizens in the US, describing the pandemic as the \u201ccommon enemy of mankind.\u201d He said: \u201cOnly by united can the international community defeat it.\u201d</p> \n<p>After the phone call, Trump said he had a \u201cvery good conversation\u201d with Xi. He wrote on Twitter that China had \u201cdeveloped a strong understanding of the virus\u201d and was working with the US.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1243407157321560071\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Just finished a very good conversation with President Xi of China.

The ban comes as the country reported its first locally infected coronavirus infection in three days and reported 54 imported cases. The move was greeted with broad support inside China.</p> \n<p>The measure applies to those with valid visas or residence permits and amounts to China shutting its borders, inviting criticism given that Beijing previously <a href=\"https://qz.com/1795806/china-compares-israel-coronavirus-controls-to-holocaust/\">condemned other countries</a> for similar moves. At the time, World Health Organization also advised countries not to shut their borders to Chinese travellers.</p> \n<p>China\u2019s Civil Aviation Administration said late on Thursday that 90% of international flights would be suspended. The number of incoming passengers would be cut to 5,000 a day, from 25,000. China has also ordered local airlines to maintain only one route per country, once a week, as of 29 March.</p> \n<p>Some say the new measures are unwarranted given already strict screening of arrivals and the fact that many incoming carriers of the virus are Chinese citizens. Vice foreign minister Luo Zhaohui said at a press conference this week that 90% of imported cases were Chinese passport holders.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/do-not-relax-covid-19-measures-in-wuhan-too-soon-scientists-warn\">Do not relax Covid-19 measures in Wuhan too soon, scientists warn</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In Beijing, all overseas arrivals must undergo quarantine at government-designated centres.

  "<p>Of the dozens of places where a coronavirus vaccine might be born, one is DIOSynVax, a small company started by a Canadian pathologist named Jonathan Heeney. In ordinary times, I\u2019d have visited Heeney in his office, in a stately red-brick building in Cambridge. I\u2019d have met his team and his Aria III cytometer, which looks like as if might brew a strong, space-age espresso but which, in fact, uses its four lasers to separate cells marked with fluorescent dyes as they flow through the machine at 10,000 cells per second. I\u2019d have tried to wangle my way into the lab designated <a href=\"https://mrc.ukri.org/documents/pdf/ssr/standards-for-containment-level-3-facilities/\" title=\"\">containment </a><a href=\"https://mrc.ukri.org/documents/pdf/ssr/standards-for-containment-level-3-facilities/\" title=\"\">level 3</a>, the highest-but-one level of biosafety security, where Heeney\u2019s biologists investigate pathogens such as the West Nile virus or the tuberculosis bacterium. These would be so lethal if they escaped that the lab is nearly hermetic. The joints along the walls, floor and ceiling are sealed and re-sealed; the steel panels in the walls, according to government guidelines, have to be \u201cof the type used in the nuclear industry\u201d; a flow of air must constantly be forced in if the door is open, to prevent the germs inside from drifting out. I would have even seen the coronavirus vaccine candidates themselves: samples of clear liquid, held in glass vials.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/apr/13/its-a-razors-edge-were-walking-inside-the-race-to-develop-a-coronavirus-vaccine-podcast\">'It\u2019s a razor\u2019s edge we\u2019re walking': inside the race to develop a coronavirus vaccine \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Heeney couldn\u2019t take the risk. Understandably, he didn\u2019t want anyone carrying Covid-19 into his lab and infecting his staff. \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge already, because when they go home to their families every day, you don\u2019t know who they\u2019re passing on the bus or the train,\u201d he said when I first spoke to him last week. At the time, Heeney was considering quarantining himself. A Cambridge college had offered him a room, so that he could shuttle between lab and bed, meeting as few people as possible. \u201cI don\u2019t have time to get sick,\u201d Heeney said. He runs his company out of Cambridge University\u2019s department of veterinary medicine, where he is a professor. He\u2019s just a 12-minute bicycle ride from where I live, but we video-conferenced on Zoom.</p> <p>Since 2016, Heeney has been honing a set of methods \u2013 a platform, in vaccine parlance \u2013 that can be used to fashion vaccines that destroy whole families of viruses. Last year, he won a Gates Foundation grant of $2m (\u00a31.6m) to fund research into a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/jan/24/endless-hunt-for-the-perfect-influenza-vaccine-flu-jab\" title=\"\">universal flu vaccine</a> \u2013 one that will prevail against every kind of flu virus. \u201cIt\u2019s the mother of all challenges, the holy grail,\u201d Heeney said. In January, he kept an eye on a new disease that was flying across eastern China. After two weeks, when Chinese scientists published the coronavirus\u2019s genetic sequence, Heeney told me his team decided: \u201cLet\u2019s do with this what we\u2019re doing with the flu.\u201d</p> <p>Defeating Covid-19 will call for more than vaccines; it will involve quarantines, social distancing, antivirals and other drugs, and healthcare for the sick. But the idea of a vaccine \u2013 the quintessential silver bullet \u2013 has come to bear an almost unreasonable allure. The coronavirus arrived at a ripe moment in genetic technology, when the advances of the past half-decade have made it possible for vaccine projects to explode off the blocks as soon as a virus is sequenced. These cutting-edge vaccines don\u2019t use weakened forms of the germ to build our immunity, as all vaccines once did; rather, they contain short copies of parts of the germ\u2019s genetic code \u2013 its DNA or RNA \u2013 which can produce fragments of the germ within our bodies.</p> <p>Thus, for the first time ever, scientists have been able to muster up vaccine prospects mere weeks into a new, fast-spreading disease. Right now, there are at least 43 Covid-19 vaccines <a href=\"https://milkeninstitute.org/sites/default/files/2020-03/Covid19%20Tracker%20032020v3-posting.pdf\" title=\"\">in development</a> around the world \u2013 in Brisbane and Hong Kong, in the US and the UK, in the labs of universities and companies. Most of these are DNA or RNA vaccines. One vaccine, made in 63 days by an American biotech firm named Moderna, <a href=\"https://www.niaid.nih.gov/news-events/nih-clinical-trial-investigational-vaccine-covid-19-begins\" title=\"\">moved into</a> human trials on 16 March, entering the bloodstream of the first of 45 healthy adult volunteers in Seattle. It was a \u201cworld indoor record\u201d, said Anthony Fauci, the doctor who heads the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. \u201cNothing has ever gone that fast.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c6068963952d884702689af1e873ed51e5604dae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c6068963952d884702689af1e873ed51e5604dae/83_0_7834_4700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Coronaviruses are named after the corona (crown) of surface proteins (outer dots) that are used to penetrate a host cell.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Coronaviruses are named after the corona (crown) of surface proteins (outer dots) that are used to penetrate a host cell.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pasieka/Getty/Science Photo Library</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Until this century, crafting a vaccine for even a long-familiar pathogen such as the polio virus, ushering it through trials and bringing it to market could take as long as 10 or 20 years. The first of these three stages is now staggeringly quick; a scientist at one company, Inovio Pharmaceuticals, told <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2237742-how-soon-will-we-have-a-coronavirus-vaccine-the-race-against-covid-19/\" title=\"\">New Scientist magazine</a> that her team had a preliminary model for a Covid-19 vaccine after just three hours of work.</p> <p>The thrust of this revolution \u2013 the capacity to create an infinitesimal part of an already minute virus, without handling a virus specimen at all \u2013 can seem godlike. But the next two stages \u2013 testing vaccines in humans and then manufacturing them for wide use \u2013 remain mortally slow. This is especially so because these newest types of vaccines \u2013 DNA or RNA vaccines \u2013 have never yet been licensed for use on humans. Outside a lab, they are completely unproven. With Covid-19, both contagion and vaccine are so new that there\u2019s no telling what human trials will reveal, or how long they will take. Every scientist, policymaker and researcher I spoke to said that we\u2019ll be lucky to have a vaccine for use within 12-18 months.</p> <p>If a DNA or RNA vaccine against Covid-19 is ever approved, it will be a watershed moment \u2013 not just because it will bear out the promise of this technology, but also because the technology will fortify us against future pandemics. Over the past few years, epidemiologists, risk analysts and policymakers have made concerted efforts to sharpen research and rethink the industrial model of vaccine production, all in preparation for the hypothetical disaster they call Disease X: any unknown disease that springs suddenly into our species and races ruinously through it. Covid-19 is the first Disease X to arise since the term was invented, but it won\u2019t be the last. The climate is warming, we\u2019re hacking down forests, our population is expanding and our skills at waging biological warfare are improving. The odds that we\u2019ll keep encountering more and more Disease Xs are increasing. We will need all the vaccines we can make.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Heeney was spending part of his winter break with friends in Canada when he first read about an outbreak in China. \u201cI\u2019m a scientist,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t help but follow this kind of news, even on holiday.\u201d Back then, it seemed like a version of flu or pneumonia that might stay in Wuhan. A few days into the new year, though, the disease\u2019s eagerness to travel became evident, and by the time Heeney rejoined his team in Cambridge, the nature of the pathogen had become clear, too. \u201cWe thought: \u2018OK, this is a coronavirus. It\u2019s going to be a tough one.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The first time Heeney encountered coronaviruses was in 1988, as an HIV researcher at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the US. Heeney had initially trained as a vet, so his boss asked him to investigate a flurry of coronavirus cases in an unusual group of patients: a pack of cheetahs. \u201cSome collector out in Oregon was trying to preserve the species by breeding them in a captive colony,\u201d Heeney said. The cheetahs lost weight, their gums swelled and their livers and kidneys struggled to function. They moped about their park, depressed and ill. Later, Heeney found that the feline coronavirus had been passed to the cheetahs by a domestic cat. For the next couple of decades, Heeney remained an HIV scientist. He didn\u2019t work much with animal viruses again until 2007, when he came to Cambridge to study diseases that spilled from animals to humans, and to develop vaccines for them.</p> <p>In its essence, even the most advanced vaccine functions on the same premise as the earliest mode of immunisation: cotton pads soaked in smallpox pus that were stuffed into the nostrils of healthy children in 16th-century China. The principle of vaccination is still to bluff the body: to slip in weakened germs, or even parts of germs, that do no harm but induce the release of antibodies that grant long-lasting immunity. The inducements have grown more sophisticated, but they continue to rely on the body\u2019s biological defences. Humankind has developed no system of immune response more effective than the one that\u2019s been inside us for hundreds of thousands of years.</p> <p>The latest class of vaccines \u2013 the type that Heeney works on \u2013 hold genetic material such as DNA or RNA; these are the kind that have never yet been licensed for use. They can be developed quickly, and they jog our immunity in distinctly different ways from everything that came before. The oldest method of vaccination involves dosing a person with inactive or enfeebled forms of the pathogen. For most of the past century, sourcing these was a laborious affair. For decades, scientists depleted the strength of viruses by growing them in human cell strains kept in labs at low temperatures; once the virus was sufficiently weak, it was safe to be sent into the human body in a vaccine. One line of lung cells, sourced from an aborted foetus in Sweden and multiplied again and again in lab cultures in the US, helped inoculate 300 million people against rubella, rabies, mumps and several other diseases.</p> <p>In the 1980s, researchers learned to mass-produce sub-units of a virus, each fragment assembled out of proteins and sugars. This might be a toxin or a part of the viral shell \u2013 just a signature whiff of the pathogen that can trigger immune reactions when introduced into the body. These molecular fragments are called antigens, because they generate antibodies that target them. Despite this technological advance, all these antigens still had to be cultivated in labs or factories.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until this century that the real leap occurred, propelling scientists towards DNA and RNA vaccines of the kind that Heeney and others develop. Once computers became powerful enough to sequence the genetic code of a pathogen quickly and cheaply, scientists were able to easily create snippets of its genes, which could then be sent into the human body. These snippets, using our own cells as miniature factories, can manufacture their antigens within us. As soon as a germ\u2019s gene sequence is known, scientists can begin concocting a vaccine for it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1dec4b762566ae17faaf4ea53e316eb39c06ff12\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1dec4b762566ae17faaf4ea53e316eb39c06ff12/0_0_4419_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A scientist in a lab in Rockville, Maryland working on a vaccine for Covid-19.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"679\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A scientist in a lab in Rockville, Maryland working on a vaccine for Covid-19.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Caballero-Reynolds/AFP via Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That\u2019s what happened with Covid-19. On the last day of 2019, Wuhan\u2019s health authorities reported the strange pneumonia variant to the World Health Organization. By mid-January, Chinese scientists had <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947\" title=\"\">posted</a> online the full, machine-readable genome of the Covid-19 virus: all 29,903 nucleic bases that comprise its sequence of RNA \u2013 ribonucleic acid, its genetic material.</p> <p>For scientists around the world, this was the starter pistol being fired. By studying the published genome, they could single out sets of genes that make specific proteins in the Covid-19 virus: the S-protein making up the spikes on the virus\u2019s outer envelope, for instance, or the phosphorus-laden protein in the walls of an inner capsule, packaging the RNA within.</p> <p>Shortly after the coronavirus\u2019s sequence was published, Heeney\u2019s team set to work. The central question in their research is this: what antigens \u2013 what portions of the virus \u2013 can be found that are similar across a range of coronaviruses? If scientists discover these and, by deploying them in vaccines, drill our immune systems to recognise them, we will have given ourselves a way to fend off several kinds of coronavirus diseases, including Covid-19. The spike proteins jutting out of all these viruses, giving the appearance of a fringed crown, are a prime example of such antigens. Every coronavirus uses its spikes to invade human cells. Once our immune systems engineer antibodies in reaction to a vaccine of spike-protein antigens, they will have not just a method to identify coronaviruses, but also a prospective point of attack to cripple them.</p> <p>The first thing Heeney\u2019s team did was compare the genetic sequences of the Covid-19 virus and other coronavirus strains, to figure out what structural commonalities they might use as antigens. This approach put me in mind of a captain of some medieval army, who had obtained the plans of the castles he planned to attack and was now studying them to see if they all contained the same weak drawbridges, so that he could order up a single siege engine to knock them all down.</p> <p>When, after a few days, they had selected their antigens \u2013 the spike protein, but also some others \u2013 the biologists in Heeney\u2019s lab looked for their \u201cblueprints\u201d: the genes that direct the virus to construct each of these antigens. These lie in the gene sequences of the coronaviruses: one section of genetic code that holds the information to make a spike protein, another section for a different antigen, and so on. In late January, the lab sent these sections of code electronically to a German company, which built them out into synthetic genes \u2013 made artificially, but otherwise consisting of the same sugars and other material as our own DNA.</p> <p>These minuscule lengths of DNA were sent back to Cambridge suspended in vials of colourless, viscous fluid. In any eventual human trials, this DNA will be injected into the body to do what it\u2019s meant to do: construct antigens to prod the immune system into action. This is all meticulous, elaborate work, but the power of modern computing can hurry it along at astonishing speed. By the first week of February, Heeney said, his scientists were carrying out trials in mice.</p> <p>In all of this, no one in Heeney\u2019s team handled the coronavirus itself; in fact, until the synthetic DNA arrived from Germany, most of their work was on computers. This would have been unimaginable for earlier generations of vaccine scientists, who took in full-strength pathogens and then, with immense care, whittled down their potency. Heeney longed to know, first-hand, how the virus behaves in cells and what kinds of antibodies respond to it. For weeks, he said, \u201cno one outside China had isolated the virus\u201d. Then, towards the end of January, scientists at the University of Melbourne announced that they\u2019d grown cultures of the virus.</p> <p>Braving the uncertainties of travel, Heeney flew via Thailand to Australia, arriving in time for the first inoculation of a mouse with the cultured virus on 19 February. \u201cI wanted to establish some collaborations with these teams. They\u2019ll be important for us down the line,\u201d Heeney told me. In a bygone time, he might have brought back a vial of virus with him. \u201cWhen I was a youngster, people would just put samples in their briefcases, or in the breast pockets of their coats. But the biosecurity protocols are intense now, so you can\u2019t do that any more.\u201d</p> <p>Unlike Heeney\u2019s project, which takes on a whole family of viruses, most vaccine projects are targeting just the virus causing Covid-19, but they follow the same basic, still-experimental approach: synthesise DNA or RNA, tuck that genetic material into a vaccine and have it build antigens once it\u2019s shot into the body. (I found only a couple of projects that are working the older way, using a weakened form of the whole virus in a vaccine.) Heeney is fully aware that these DNA and RNA vaccines may all still collapse in trials. \u201cThere are graveyards full of failed viral vaccine candidates,\u201d he said. But if even one succeeds, \u201cthen we\u2019ll be entering a brave new world of vaccines\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>To an outsider, the design of a DNA or RNA vaccine in a lab seems like cool, ordered science, conducted by computers, technicians in sterile oversuits, and machines that hum quietly. The next stage \u2013 when the vaccine has to negotiate clinical trials \u2013 is rife with all the messy uncertainties of human biology. In other words, while genetic technology has dramatically shrunk the first leg of the process from years to weeks, the second leg remains as long as ever, so that vaccine development now resembles a pair of misshapen trousers.</p> <p>Regulatory trials take months or even years because, for one, they can\u2019t go faster than the rate at which humans metabolise vaccines. But they\u2019re also time-consuming because so much is at stake, and because it\u2019s impossible to predict how our complex physiology will react to a new vaccine. These trials determine if a vaccine is safe, what its dosages should be, how effective it is, and what its side effects are. In the US, 90% of drugs fail to make it past these trials. The overriding purpose of the process is abundant caution; a vaccine that unexpectedly proves harmful is the industry\u2019s worst nightmare.</p> <p>In the literature, past mishaps flash like red warning signals. In 1942, a yellow fever vaccine contaminated with a hepatitis B virus was given to more than 300,000 American troops; nearly 150 of them died. The field\u2019s classic reference text, Plotkin\u2019s Vaccines, by the physician Stanley Plotkin, refers sombrely to \u201cthe Cutter incident\u201d \u2013 a 1955 episode in which a manufacturer named Cutter Laboratories failed to properly deactivate the virus in its polio shot. The faulty vaccine caused roughly 40,000 cases of polio, paralysed 260 people and killed 10.</p> <p>The US\u2019s strict rules to regulate vaccines <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1383764/\" title=\"\">emerged</a>, in part, because of Cutter Laboratories. The company survived, but paid out millions in civil damages. The Cutter incident set a precedent for more lawsuits during the next three decades, in which parents argued that their children had been disabled by malfunctioning vaccines. Some pharma firms, worried about multimillion-dollar claims settlements, abandoned vaccines altogether; others hiked their prices to cover any future legal costs. To keep vaccines cheap and vaccinations regular, the US government had to set up a compensation fund that eased most of the liability on vaccine companies.</p> <p>In the midst of a pandemic, so many forces tug at the vaccine development process \u2013 politics, industry, science, money, fear, hope \u2013 that there\u2019s a perpetual hazard of clinical trials being hurried or of a poorly planned vaccination scheme being rushed out. One historical analogue is found in 1976 \u2013 like 2020, an election year. That February, a bout of swine flu broke out in an army post in New Jersey, and one soldier died. In comparison to Covid-19, the outbreak now seems minor, but it jolted President Ford\u2019s government, which was already suffering from the second-hand shame of Nixon\u2019s resignation just two years earlier. The administration fretted that, in the autumn, at the height of flu season, the virus would exact a huge loss of life; one government estimate figured that 1 million Americans would die.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Get the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-long-read\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Long Read email\u201d data-form-description=\u201cGet the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\u201d scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning</figcaption> </figure>  <p>So Ford announced a plan to vaccinate everyone in the country, and had the Centers for Disease Control draft a $136m plan to do it. He ignored Albert Sabin, one of the heroes of the polio vaccine, who advised against immunisation, believing that no epidemic was imminent. Ford also ignored the warnings coming out of clinical trials, in which one of the four manufacturers was found to have formulated some unknown number of its 2.6m doses with a different flu virus altogether. Congress exempted all these companies from liabilities if their vaccine harmed anyone. Beginning in October, 40 million Americans were vaccinated, but by mid-December, it emerged that the shot came with a slightly increased risk of contracting Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome, an immobilising neurological condition.</p> <p>The vaccine campaign was scrapped soon after; by that time, close to 450 people had been afflicted with Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9. It was impossible to say how many of these cases were seeded by the vaccine. And if the vaccine really did prevent a swine flu epidemic, there was no way to know; the counterfactual \u2013 no vaccination, a ravaging pandemic \u2013 was hidden from view. This vaccine\u2019s legacy, in public memory, was the paralysis of those hundreds of people.</p> <p>Already, the temptation to accelerate the trials of Covid-19 vaccines is becoming apparent. Earlier this month, Donald Trump suggested using \u201ca solid flu vaccine \u2026 on corona\u201d. Not possible, scientists informed him. When he declared that a vaccine would be available within a few months, he had to be told that, in that time, vaccines would only be ready for testing. Ordinarily, human trials come after many phases of animal testing, but at least two companies \u2013 one of them Moderna \u2013 have decided to do both in parallel. The scientists I spoke to, though, kept telling me that testing couldn\u2019t be rushed. \u201cThere will be many trials, and we need to be ready for some failures,\u201d Heeney said. He leaned in towards his webcam as if to push his point physically through the internet to me. \u201cWe have to avoid overpromising, because if there\u2019s an accident with one of those first vaccines \u2013 if someone gets ill and it gets into the Daily Mail, \u2018New vaccine threatens survival\u2019 or some ridiculous headline \u2013 then people won\u2019t want to take even the later vaccines that do work. It\u2019s a razor\u2019s edge we\u2019re walking here.\u201d</p> <p>Among the peculiarities of this pandemic, moreover, is the fact that we, the general populace, might determine how well human trials go. If huge swathes of society become infected before the vaccine is ready to test on humans, the trials will be difficult to conduct, said Sarah Gilbert, an immunologist at the University of Oxford\u2019s Edward Jenner Institute for Vaccine Research. Gilbert\u2019s team also has a vaccine candidate for Covid-19, based on an earlier vaccine it had devised for Middle East respiratory syndrome, or Mers, another coronavirus disease. In mid-March, Gilbert had to put an auto-response on her email. When her team was ready to recruit subjects for vaccine trials, it would be advertised on the website, she wrote. \u201cPlease do not contact me about volunteering.\u201d</p> <p>Gilbert\u2019s worry is that, at the peak of infection, the virus will be bouncing so frantically around the population that \u201cyou can\u2019t screen your volunteers. By the time you get their results back, they may have been exposed.\u201d Organising trials after the peak subsides presents another problem, because so many people will have cultivated a natural immunity by then. Transmission will have dropped as well, Gilbert said \u2013 it\u2019s hard to know how well a vaccine trial is going if the subjects aren\u2019t being exposed to the virus at all. \u201cThis is herd immunity \u2013 good for the population, but it makes testing a vaccine more difficult,\u201d she explained.</p> <p>The best possible scenario involves delaying the pandemic\u2019s peak \u2013 pushing it through the summer towards August, to buy scientists a few extra months to run their trials. \u201cSo we\u2019d really be pleased,\u201d Gilbert said sternly, \u201cif everyone will just do what they\u2019re being told and stay at home.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>At some point in March, Heeney\u2019s sense of time started to grow muddled. Things happened so fast, and his weeks were so full, that dates lost their meaning; once, while speaking to me, he had to thumb back through his email to recollect even roughly when a particular step in his research had happened. \u201cThe coronavirus dominates our days,\u201d he said. He wakes before dawn to pore through feeds of scientific data and journal articles. \u201cThere are conference calls, there\u2019s all this paperwork to fill out so we can deal safely with pathogens, there\u2019s the need to scale up the lab to work on the vaccine. There\u2019s just no routine anymore. It feels like the wild west right now.\u201d</p> <p>Like every other scientist, Heeney spends part of his days worrying about funding. All these vaccine projects hurtling towards trials may yet be drawn to a screeching halt by a lack of money. Trials are expensive; so is the outlay on manufacturing and marketing vaccines. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to make enough doses for the whole world, you\u2019re going to need billions and billions of dollars,\u201d Heeney said. Earlier this week, the Wellcome Trust put an exact number on it: a further $3bn, across the industry, to fund and produce enough vaccines to beat the pandemic.</p> <p>Most of this money will go towards trials and production, the costs of which are now frequently borne by drug companies. After the 80s, when a series of mergers left the pharma industry in the hands of a few behemoth companies, vaccines fell thoroughly under the sway of market forces, subject to the kind of logic that prompted Goldman Sachs, in a 2018 report, to wonder: \u201cIs curing patients a sustainable business model?\u201d (It isn\u2019t, the analysts <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/04/curing-disease-not-a-sustainable-business-model-goldman-sachs-analysts-say/\" title=\"\">concluded</a>.)</p> <p>Diseases that are borne out of poverty, and that require cheap vaccines, such as cholera, are largely ignored, says Peter Jay Hotez, the dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. So are diseases that are uncommon, or diseases that have come and gone. Taxpayers fund most vaccine research, but the pharma titans that can make them at scale are reluctant to commit to a vaccine if the likelihood of profit is meagre. \u201cWe have a broken ecosystem for making vaccines,\u201d Hotez told me.</p> <p>If the business wasn\u2019t set up this way, Hotez thinks, he\u2019d have a Covid-19 vaccine to offer, based on an earlier project that wilted from lack of funding. The story of Hotez\u2019s vaccine is a parable for this field, and it foretells one highly possible future for all the exciting vaccine work currently underway against Covid-19.</p> <p>When Sars broke out in 2002, scientists and companies rolled up their sleeves to deliver a vaccine. But after 2004, no Sars cases were reported, so research flagged; one vaccine, from Sanofi, never made it past clinical trials. Ideally, Hotez says, vaccines would still have been run through the first few steps of trials and kept in reserve for future emergencies. Between 2011 and 2016, Hotez and his team designed a potential vaccine for Sars, and had the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research make 20,000 doses, to test on humans. But none of Hotez\u2019s usual funders gave him a grant for these trials. \u201cSars dropped off their list of priorities,\u201d Maria Elena Bottazzi, one of Hotez\u2019s collaborators at Baylor, told me. \u201cWe had other situations, like Ebola or Zika.\u201d The industry\u2019s attention is easily diverted, Hotez said. \u201cIt\u2019s like little kids playing a football game. The ball goes in one direction and all the kids run after it. Then it goes in another direction and all the kids run that way.\u201d</p> <p>So much about Covid-19 is still unclear that companies can\u2019t yet gauge the profit margins on a vaccine. Will the disease fade before a vaccine is approved? Will DNA or RNA vaccines even work? Will everyone be inoculated \u2013 a bumper payday from billions of doses \u2013 or will vaccines go to just a few at-risk groups, such as healthcare workers or anyone over 40? \u201cAt some point, there will be a go/no-go decision to make for companies,\u201d said Jason Schwartz, a vaccine policy scholar at Yale. \u201cAnd then they\u2019ll have to figure out if it\u2019s worth the risk.\u201d One way to make it worthwhile is to engage in price gouging, which drug companies have always been happy to do. Earlier this month, the US <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/03/13/big-pharma-drug-pricing-coronavirus-profits/\" title=\"\">passed</a> a coronavirus spending bill that deliberately left out controls on vaccine prices.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d7c7fd093581e39edb35d088209056ac2824f8fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d7c7fd093581e39edb35d088209056ac2824f8fd/0_0_2000_1333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Equipment in a Biocad lab, a Russian biotechnology company, working on a Covid-19 vaccine.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Equipment in a Biocad lab, a Russian biotechnology company, working on a Covid-19 vaccine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Biocad Press Office/TASS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the same time, pharma companies are indispensable, said Charlie Weller, who heads the vaccines programme at the Wellcome Trust. (When Weller spoke to me one evening on the phone, she had to break off for a minute to comfort her little daughter, who\u2019d burst into tears after learning that, as the child of a key worker, she\u2019d have to keep going to school even while her friends stayed home.) Pharma firms pay for most clinical trials, invest in experts and equipment, and bring drugs to market. They assume the right to set prices and decide what vaccines to sell because they claim to bear the most financial risk. \u201cIf we have to be ready for more Disease Xs, we need to rethink this whole underlying structure,\u201d Weller told me. \u201cWe have to do it so that the risk is shared.\u201d</p> <p>Two years ago, the Coalition of Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (Cepi) was founded to do just this: to allay some of the financial risk of research, and to keep this research going even in the troughs between epidemics. Cepi\u2019s funding \u2013 about $740m \u2013 comes from a combination of philanthropists and governments. Melanie Saville, its director of vaccine development, told me that they were funding eight ongoing Covid-19 vaccine projects. But Cepi\u2019s own money for Covid-19 was going to run out by the end of March. Without more donations, none of its funded vaccines would progress beyond the first phase of clinical trials.</p> <p>One of Cepi\u2019s ambitions is to create its own \u201cinvestigational stockpile\u201d of vaccines \u2013 vaccines that have passed the first two out of three stages of clinical trials, and that then bide their time in cold storage. Everyone hopes they will never be required, but if necessary, they can be brought forth, hustled through the final clinical trial stage \u2013 which must be conducted in a real outbreak \u2013 and launched into production. Saville said Cepi has no storage or clinical facilities of its own, and that the stockpiles would reside individually with manufacturers. This disappointed me; for a second, I\u2019d dreamed of a vaccine storehouse nestled somewhere in the Arctic \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/may/20/the-doomsday-vault-seeds-save-post-apocalyptic-world\" title=\"\">a Svalbard</a> against sickness, a vault so titanic that it dwarfed the germs it intended to fight by zillions of orders of magnitude.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>A week after I met Heeney on Zoom, I called him again. He gave me a phone number in his Cambridge college; he had decided to self-quarantine himself in a room after all. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019ve been at risk, but if one of us goes down, we all go down like dominoes,\u201d he said. He was full of praise for his team \u2013 \u201call these bright, talented individuals who are still living at home but are otherwise trying to live isolated lives, like monks in a monastery\u201d. When Heeney moved into his room, he wiped down all the surfaces. One day, he went to get a cup of coffee, and when he came back to his room, he saw that two men had come in to change the batteries in the fire alarm. \u201cIt was crazy. I thought: \u2018Here I am trying to keep the risk factor low. Does this have to happen now?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>His lab is still running trials in mice. It\u2019s a long process, he said. \u201cYou take tissue cultures from the mice and you study them. We\u2019re getting all this data, so that we can see what works and what doesn\u2019t.\u201d It\u2019s too early to tell which of the vaccine projects out there will succeed, he said. \u201cYou know, I think it\u2019s pretty amazing that humans have got vaccines in trials already,\u201d Heeney said. \u201cThe trials will tell us what we need to know. My worry is that the devil is in the details with this coronavirus. But I hope I\u2019m wrong. I really hope I\u2019m wrong.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022</em> Follow the Long Read on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a>, and sign up to the long read weekly email <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/info/ng-interactive/2017/may/05/sign-up-for-the-long-read-email\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p>",

The bill offers laid-off workers an additional $600 a week for four months and extends unemployment benefits to gig workers, independent contractors, and others who have not previously been eligible for unemployment, including people forced to leave their jobs to care for family members with coronavirus, or to care for children whose schools have closed.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/26/us-stimulus-bill-worker-relief\">'$1,200 isn't enough': what a $2tn relief bill means for American workers</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7d39128f08af215f6fc1a8\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-26T23:22:50.192Z\">11.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Florida poll workers test positive for coronavirus</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><em>The Guardian\u2019s Sam Levine reports:</em></p> \n  <p>Two Florida poll workers tested positive for coronavirus after the state\u2019s March 17 primary, the Broward County supervisor of elections announced Thursday.</p> \n  <p>The announcement came after Florida<a href=\"https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2020%2Fmar%2F15%2Fflorida-primary-tuesday-coronavirus-fears\"> faced criticism</a> for moving ahead in-person voting despite concerns over coronavirus.

So far, only three countries have followed the commission\u2019s advice to create \u201cgreen lanes\u201d (minimal checks) to speed up the traffic.</p> \n  <p>* <em>We\u2019re still waiting for a press conference by Von der Leyen and Charles Michel, president of the European council, to start.</em></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f481062edc5783621a9338b3ff2a1516b3a8fcc6\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f481062edc5783621a9338b3ff2a1516b3a8fcc6/0_133_3975_2385/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A member of European Parliament wearing protective masks and gloves attend a mini plenary session of European Parliament in Brussels, Belgium, on March 26, 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A member of European Parliament wearing protective mask and gloves at the European parliament in Brussels.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aris Oikonomou/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-26T17:57:59.898Z\">at 5.57pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7ce7bf8f081e5eda2376f1\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-26T17:36:53.497Z\">5.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Covid-19 threatens to 'tear us apart', G20 leaders told by WHO director</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The leaders of the powerful G20 countries have been urged to unite to find joint solutions to the coronavirus pandemic and \u201cignite a new global movement\u201d to ensure it never happens again.</p> \n  <p>Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the World Health Organization, urged leaders \u201cto fight without excuses, without regrets \u2013 thanking countries who have already taken steps and urgently asking that they do more\u201d. <br></p> \n  <p>A WHO press statement issued in the last few minutes added that Ghebreyesus had told G20 leaders: \u201cYou have come together to confront the defining health crisis of our time: we are at war with a virus that threatens to tear us apart \u2013 if we let it.\u201d</p> \n  <p> He also welcomed G20 leaders\u2019 commitment \u201cto do whatever it takes to overcome the pandemic\u201d to protect lives and livelihoods, as well as restore confidence and shore up stability in trade and other sectors, and to commit to take all necessary health measures and seek to ensure adequate financing to contain the pandemic and protect people, especially the most vulnerable.\u201c</p> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/26/coronavirus-live-news-update-world-lockdown-global-deaths-india-uk-us-australia-china-latest-updates?page=with:block-5e7cd9df8f081e5eda2375ed#block-5e7cd9df8f081e5eda2375ed\">As we reported earlier,</a> the G20 issued a largely unspecific and uncontroversial joint communique which set no specific commitments such as deferring debt repayment to the world\u2019s poorest countries, as sought by the World Bank and the IMF.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-26T18:00:13.883Z\">at 6.00pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7ce4b38f0878a2a48aae2e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/rorycarroll\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-26T17:24:27.930Z\">5.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ireland\">Ireland</a> has found a readymade force in the fight against coronavirus: the postal service.<br></p> \n  <p>Postal workers have volunteered to check in on elderly and vulnerable people during their rounds, a potentially invaluable safeguard while such groups cocoon.</p> \n  <p>The employees suggested the idea to the Communications Workers\u2019 Union, which took it to management and the government, who gladly accepted.</p> \n  <p>Postal workers are known and trusted by the people they serve, David McRedmond, the CEO of An Post, the Irish postal service, told a news conference. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThey\u2019re going with a set of questions.

Put the people to work. Preserve the elderly, preserve those who have health problems. But nothing more than that,\u201d said Bolsonaro, who in the past has sparked anger by calling the virus a \u201clittle flu\u201d. <br><br>The country\u2019s governors protested on Wednesday that his instructions run counter to health experts\u2019 recommendations and endanger Latin Americas largest population. <br><br>They said they would continue with their strict measures. The rebellion even included traditional allies of Brazil\u2019s far-right president. <br></p> \n  <p>Gov. Carlos Mois\u00e9s of Santa Catarina state, which gave almost 80% of its votes to Bolsonaro in the 2018 presidential runoff, complained he was blown away by the presidents instructions. <br><br>In a videoconference earlier in the day between Bolsonaro and governors from Brazil\u2019s southeast region, Sao Paulo Gov. Jo\u00e3o Doria threatened to sue the federal government if it tried to interfere with his efforts to combat the virus.<br><br>The governors weren\u2019t the only defiant ones. Virus plans challenged by Bolsonaro were upheld by the Supreme Court. The heads of both congressional houses criticized his televised speech. Companies donated supplies to state anti-virus efforts.<br><br>Bolsonaro told reporters in the capital, Brasilia, that he has listened to his US counterpart, Donald Trump, and found their perspectives to be rather similar.<br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7c3ef48f08af215f6fb713\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time
