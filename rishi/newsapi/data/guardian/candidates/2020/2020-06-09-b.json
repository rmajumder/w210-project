Protesters sat in silence for several minutes before chanting \u201cdecolonise\u201d at Oxford University, whose building the statue adorns.

About 50 people then marched to Downing Street, some carrying \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d signs, and chanted \u201cwe want Boris\u201d and \u201cjustice for Windrush\u201d.</li> \n   <li><strong>All Labour councils in England and Wales \u2013 including London and Manchester \u2013 vowed to review their statues and public monuments amid rising concern about the celebration of historical industrialists with links to the slave trade</strong>. The effect of the toppling of Edward Colston\u2019s statue in Bristol on Sunday rippled across the country, with hundreds of local authorities now expected to consider renaming public monuments.</li> \n   <li><strong>The Museum for London said it was working with partners to remove the statue of 18th century slave owner Robert Milligan</strong>. The monument has become a focus of protest since it was targeted at the weekend.</li> \n   <li><strong>A statue of King Leopold II in Belgium was taken down after being vandalised and set on fire by protesters</strong>.

He says it was striking that <strong>Boris Johnson</strong> used cabinet this morning to reset his response to the <strong>Black Lives Matter</strong> protests, reinforcing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/08/i-hear-you-boris-johnson-to-black-lives-matter-protesters\">the message he conveyed in a video message last night.</a></p> \n  <p>In a tweet on Sunday night, after BLM protesters tore down the <strong>Edward Colston</strong> statue in Bristol and a minority of BLM protesters in London got involved in clashes with the police, Johnson posted this on Twitter.</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>Boris Johnson #StayAlert<strong>\u2714</strong>@BorisJohnson</p> \n   <p>People have a right to protest peacefully &amp; while observing social distancing but they have no right to attack the police.

The spokesman said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The PM began cabinet by discussing the anger and the grief felt not just in the US but around the world following the death of George Floyd. He said those who lead and govern simply cannot ignore the depth of emotion that has been triggered.</p> \n   <p>He said there was an undeniable feeling of injustice and that people from black and minority ethnic groups do face discrimination, in education, in employment and in the application of criminal law.</p> \n   <p>He said we are a much, much less racist society than we were, but we must also frankly acknowledge that there is so much more to do in eradicating prejudice and creating opportunity. Cabinet reiterated its commitment to that effort.</p> \n   <p>The PM said his message to all those who protested lawfully was \u2018I hear you and I understand\u2019. However, he said this cause is not an acceptable [reason] for violence or [relaxing the rules] regarding to social distancing. He said those who attack public property or the police are undermining the cause they claim to represent and will face the full force of the law.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This also suggests that No 10 has now crafted what it views as a better response to the question \u2018Is Britain racist?\u2019. <strong>Matt Hancock</strong>, the health secretary, was asked this on Sky\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday at the weekend and he said that it wasn\u2019t, although he said there was still injustice that needed to be tackled. At the No 10 lobby briefing yesterday, in response to the same question, the spokesman said that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jun/08/uk-coronavirus-johnson-says-anti-racist-protests-were-subverted-by-thuggery-live-news-covid19-updates?page=with:block-5ede2ee48f0883ec2fc1cf7e#block-5ede2ee48f0883ec2fc1cf7e\">Johnson did not think the UK was a racist country. </a>Now the line is that the UK is \u201cmuch, much less racist\u201d than it was.</p> \n  <p>At today\u2019s briefing the spokesman was also asked if Johnson felt that any of <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/boris-johnson-record-sexist-homophobic-and-racist-comments-bumboys-piccaninnies-2019-6?r=US&amp;IR=T\">his various racially offensive comments in the past</a> had contributed to the UK\u2019s problems in this regard.

I understood the arguments, it certainly seems anachronous, and while the thoughts of its removal in no way concerned me, I simply considered it someone else\u2019s decision to make. On reflection I think this attitude was probably a fault and an act of complicity in allowing the damage of Rhodes\u2019 actions during his lifetime, and the century of their legacy to go unchallenged. I believe now is the time to remove the statue from the college and that is it is in all our interest that is done proactively and peacefully.

Today is the latest high-stakes test of whether a state can hold an election during the Covid-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</p> <p>Tuesday also marked the first time Georgia was using new <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/how-georgia-new-electronic-voting-machines-work/RyIOJuHYQgktcCNGL9sEoK/\">voting equipment</a>, and voters reported malfunctions on Tuesday morning. The Atlanta mayor, Keisha Lance Bottoms, tweeted that at some precincts no machines <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/polls-open-and-voters-line-for-georgia-primary/RDkUA0eKfnge6xuWT3YwiJ/\">were working.</a></p> <p>Voters snaked around the parking lot of the Lions Club community center in Cobb county, where many said around noon that they had been waiting in line for two to three hours. At least half of the voters appeared to be wearing masks, and some voters carried umbrellas to shield themselves from the sun.</p> <p>Chloe Mexile Benard, 33, said she had been waiting since 7.30am to vote. She reached the front of the line around noon, cheering as she was finally ushered in by a volunteer. She came to vote for the presidential primary, but also to choose the county commissioner and county sheriff, she said.&nbsp;</p> <p>Asked why she didn\u2019t vote with a mail-in ballot, Benard, whose T-shirt said \u201cDreams don\u2019t expire,\u201d said she doesn\u2019t trust them. \u201cI requested it. I received it, but I don\u2019t trust anybody,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t trust them to count it.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Benard said there were just two voting machines at the station when she arrived. Then, \u201ctwo more appeared, magically,\u201d she said. Geraldine Aldridge, a polling manager at the site, said seven machines including one for handicapped voters, were working at noon.&nbsp;<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/KeishaBottoms/status/1270321447576141824\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This seems to be happening throughout Atlanta and perhaps throughout the county.

But at least one precinct told the paper that they did not have access to provisional ballots.&nbsp;</p> <p>The problems in Georgia add to mounting concerns over whether states are prepared to hold elections in November. Like many other states, Georgia encouraged voters to cast their ballot by mail, but was plagued by delays in getting voters ballots and still saw extremely long lines at the polls. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/07/wisconsin-votes-controversial-election-coronavirus-us-election-2020\">Wisconsin</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/02/democratic-primaries-vote-amid-covid-mass-protests\">Pennsylvania and Washington DC </a>have all seen similar problems in their recent primaries.</p> <p>In Fulton county, Simone Alisa, 66, said she requested a mail-in ballot but never received one. Two voters in line next to her said they did not receive their ballots either. Alisa said she waited for close to three hours to cast her vote for the presidential primary, district attorney and state court judges.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThis isn\u2019t normal,\u201d said Alisa, who says she has voted in Fulton county for the past 10 years. She said she has never waited for more than 30 minutes to cast her ballot.</p> <p>By November, Alisa hopes to see improvements. \u201cEither we receive our absentee ballot,\u201d she said. \u201cBy that time, I would think we can have more people facilitate the voting.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>On their way out of the Central Park Recreation Center, where the voting took place, Ashraf and Laurel Hussain, 37 and 48, said they had waited four and a half hours before entering the building. The pair said they were worried about the coronavirus after seeing that none of the touchscreens used to cast votes were sanitized by poll workers.</p> <p>The pair said they had requested mail-in ballots in late April, but never received them.</p> <p>\u201cWe wanted to avoid having to interact in the Covid situation, but unfortunately we were kind of forced to,\u201d Ashraf said.</p> <p>Like other voters, they said they were grateful for the volunteers (some of whom were candidates themselves) offering bottled water and snacks to those standing in line.</p> <p>\u201cFrom a local level, they\u2019re doing everything they can do. But it seems like they weren\u2019t necessarily given the tools to do what they needed to do,\u201d said Ashraf.&nbsp;</p> <p>Polling hours were extended until 9pm in Fulton county and until 8pm at several locations in Cobb county because of issues Tuesday, <a href=\"https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/polls-open-and-voters-line-for-georgia-primary/RDkUA0eKfnge6xuWT3YwiJ/\">according</a> to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

Brad Raffensperger, the state\u2019s top election official, encouraged people to vote by mail, and an unprecedented 1.5 million Georgians requested absentee ballots for the election.

And at least seven polling locations in the Atlanta metro area did not open on time, said Seth Bringman, a spokesman for Fair Fight Action, the voting rights group started by Stacey Abrams.</p> <p>Raffensperger\u2019s office blamed the delays on human error.</p> <p>\u201cSo far we have no reports of any actual equipment issues. We do have reports of equipment being delivered to the wrong locations and delivered late. We have reports of poll workers not understanding setup or how to operate voting equipment,\u201d Gabriel Sterling, the chief operating officer for the secretary of state\u2019s office said in a statement Tuesday morning. \u201cWhile these are unfortunate, they are not issues of the equipment but a function of counties engaging in poor planning, limited training, and failures of leadership. Well over 2,000 precincts are functioning normally throughout the state of Georgia.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Hours later, Raffensperger released his own statement focusing on problems in two Atlanta-area counties in the state. The Associated Press reported that the problems <a href=\"https://apnews.com/e7ea6e919fadb995c407eea3a4450176\">were not confined to those areas</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThe voting situation today in certain precincts in Fulton and Dekalb counties is unacceptable. My office has opened an investigation to determine what these counties need to do to resolve these issues before November\u2019s election,\u201d Raffensperger said.</p> <p>\u201cObviously, the first time a new voting system is used there is going to be a learning curve, and voting in a pandemic only increased these difficulties. But every other county faced these same issues and were significantly better prepared to respond so that voters had every opportunity to vote.\u201d</p> <p>Stacey Abrams, the 2018 Democratic nominee for governor in Georgia, harshly criticized Raffensperger Tuesday evening for blaming counties and said he was abdicating his responsibility as the state\u2019s top election official.</p> <p>\u201cIt is not sufficient to say that the county you live in determines the quality of your democracy,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Abrams said she had requested her absentee ballot in May, but was unable to vote with it because the return envelope arrived sealed shut. After unsuccessfully trying to steam it open, she said she went to vote in person on Tuesday. Abrams said Fair Fight, the voting rights group she leads, would soon bring litigation against the state for the way it handled the election, and cautioned Republican efforts to suppress voting rights would only increase as November approached.</p> <p>In addition to Georgia, Nevada, South Carolina, West Virginia and North Dakota are all holding primaries on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>",

  "<p>If you were going to write a novel about a bigoted southern Republican senator eager to turn the US into a military dictatorship, it would feel heavy-handed to name the protagonist Tom Cotton.

He appeals to the Trump wing of the Republican party, but, crucially, he also has strong ties with the establishment. \u201cHow many guys in town can give a speech at the Council on Foreign Relations and also get kudos in the pages of Breitbart?\u201d&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/11/13/is-tom-cotton-the-future-of-trumpism\">Steve Bannon asked the New Yorker in 2017</a>. \u201cThe answer is, one guy.\u201d That guy? Cotton.</p> <p>We will eventually see the end of Trump\u2019s presidency, but it will be far harder to get rid of Trumpism. The question is: how will Trump\u2019s legacy evolve? Will it fade into the fringes or take on a more serious, more sinister, facade? Trumpism is largely defined by incompetence and farce, but Cotton could spin it into something a lot more terrifying and even more tragic.</p> <ul> <li><p>Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist</p></li> </ul>",

  "<p>Largely overlooked&nbsp;during&nbsp;last week\u2019s extraordinary events was a letter written by the president\u2019s erstwhile&nbsp;personal&nbsp;lawyer and retweeted by Trump.</p> <p>As you\u2019ll recall: last week President Trump used military personnel to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/02/outrageous-christian-leaders-reject-trump-use-of-church-as-prop-during-george-floyd-protests\">forcibly clear proteste</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/02/outrageous-christian-leaders-reject-trump-use-of-church-as-prop-during-george-floyd-protests\">rs</a> outside the White House so he could do a surreal photo op at St John\u2019s church. Then Trump\u2019s former secretary of defense, Gen James Mattis, published a <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/06/james-mattis-denounces-trump-protests-militarization/612640/\">statement</a> in the Atlantic condemning his former commander-in-chief for abusing his authority and failing to exercise unifying, mature leadership.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s former personal lawyer, John Dowd, rushed to Trump\u2019s defense. His <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1268675068814659584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1268675068814659584&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fthehill.com%2Fhomenews%2Fadministration%2F501257-trump-tweets-copy-of-letter-from-john-dowd-to-jim-mattis\">letter</a> \u2013 a personal note to Mattis, whom he addresses as \u201cJim\u201d \u2013 is an unusual and disturbing document. In it, Dowd accuses Mattis of letting himself be used by a \u201cbunch of hack politicians\u201d and aligning himself with the \u201cugly, hateful, disgraceful\u201d attitudes of Democratic politicians. Mattis, Dowd asserts, has sullied his once-sterling reputation for all time.&nbsp;</p> <p>But Dowd\u2019s letter does more than simply seek to discredit Mattis. By way of justifying the president\u2019s use of force in DC, Dowd brands those collected in Lafayette Park as \u201cphony protesters\u201d who \u201cwere not peaceful and are not real\u201d. They were, Dowd declares, \u201cterrorists\u201d. To be clear, Dowd&nbsp;is not describing the rioters who smashed&nbsp;stores or shot and killed a retired police captain in St Louis. He is describing citizens who were doing what the constitution recognizes as a fundamental right \u2013 engaging in peaceable protest. That is, until, without warning, they were stormed in a show of force that smacked of an authoritarian crackdown.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Dowd\u2019s brandishing of the term 'terrorist' represents a frightening rhetorical escalation at a perilous time</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Trump\u2019s presidency has largely inured us to overheated rhetoric. We\u2019ve grown accustomed to Trump and his allies vilifying journalists as \u201cenemies of the people\u201d or&nbsp;characterizing&nbsp;officials trying to hold him to account as treasonous criminals. All the same, Dowd\u2019s brandishing of the term \u201cterrorist\u201d represents a frightening rhetorical escalation at a perilous time in the life of our nation.</p> <p>In his letter, Dowd reminds Mattis of Dowd\u2019s own previous military service \u2013 he addresses the general as one marine to another. Yet for people in the military, the word \u201cterrorist\u201d is hardly a casual term.&nbsp;Since 9/11, the fight against terrorists has resulted in two decades of American wars abroad. Thousands of American soldiers have died in the effort to vanquish this existential foe, who has come to represent the most legitimate target of the lethal force of the world\u2019s mightiest military.</p> <p>In labeling protesters as terrorists, Dowd engages in something far more ominous&nbsp;and shocking&nbsp;than&nbsp;mere&nbsp;rhetorical overkill. He&nbsp;is effectively&nbsp;erasing&nbsp;the difference between Americans peaceably exercising their constitutional rights and Isis insurgents laying down roadside explosives.&nbsp;</p> <p>That Trump has approvingly retweeted Dowd\u2019s unhinged rhetoric is disturbing enough. More alarming still, Dowd\u2019s words find a powerful echo in Tom Cotton\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/opinion/tom-cotton-protests-military.html\">recent, alarming call</a> in the New York Times for an \u201coverwhelming show of force\u201d to restore order to the streets of America \u2013 shock and awe as a tool for pacifying the American citizenry. Such calls to unleash the military at home provide a foretaste of how Trump might respond to protests in the wake of a contested election in November. That Trump will challenge a loss at the polls can be safely assumed.&nbsp;I suspect&nbsp;he will go further still: if he loses re-election he will almost certainly frame his electoral defeat as a fraud orchestrated by the Democratic party and the mainstream press.&nbsp;</p> <p>Imagine, then, that pro-Biden demonstrators take to the streets, demanding that Trump leave office. Does anyone believe Trump would recoil from invoking the Insurrection Act of 1807 \u2013 the step Cotton advocated in his now-notorious&nbsp;Times&nbsp;op-ed \u2013 to use troops to restore \u201corder\u201d? Last week, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper \u2013 Mattis\u2019s successor at the Pentagon \u2013 aroused the president\u2019s ire when he expressed reservations about invoking the Act.</p> <p>Come the weeks after 3 November, it is doubtful that an impulsive, cornered Trump would listen to calls for restraint \u2013 not with the likes of John Dowd and Tom Cotton whispering in the president\u2019s inflamed ear.</p> <ul> <li><p>Lawrence Douglas is the James J Grosfeld Professor of Law, Jurisprudence &amp; Social Thought at Amherst College.

  "<p>Donald Trump once famously boasted he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue, and not lose supporters. For years that seemed true.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/07/donald-trump-re-election-nixon-protests-strategy\">Trump reaches for Nixon playbook after protests that have rocked America</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But his latest actions \u2013 including the deployment of an ad hoc paramilitary force against protesters on avenues around the country \u2013 may have been too much. &nbsp;</p> <p>New <a href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/06/new-cnn-poll-trump-biden-support-majority-50-percent.html\">polls</a> show Trump\u2019s support is slipping among key <a href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/06/new-cnn-poll-trump-biden-support-majority-50-percent.html\">groups</a>, some showing him at a double-digit disadvantage to Democratic rival Joe Biden.</p> <p>Last Monday night, police and soldiers violently cleared protesters so Trump could walk from the White House to St John\u2019s church for a photo opportunity. At that moment, Nolan Fuzzell had seen enough.</p> <p>Fuzzell is a table server at a restaurant in Lawrence, Kansas, and previously supported Trump. But after the photo stunt he tweeted: \u201cBeginning to regret wearing all Trump gear on Election Day 2016. This is not right, on any level.\u201d</p> <p>So how did Trump lose supporters like Fuzzell, and are they gone for good?</p> <p>It\u2019s helpful to remember, first, what the president has asked of Republicans. He has treated the party like Theseus\u2019s ancient ship, replacing one plank at a time until it becomes unrecognizable as itself.&nbsp;From a party whose elites sought to reject Trump in 2016, it has now become almost unerringly loyal and much changed.</p> <p>Under Trump\u2019s leadership, Republicans have gone to war against their traditional allies, the FBI. They have cozied up to their old opponents, in Russia. Republican leaders have signed off on federal deficits so gargantuan \u2013 this year it will top a trillion dollars \u2013 they would make Franklin D Roosevelt blush.&nbsp;</p> <p>Trump adherents have had to boycott the reddest of American sports, professional football.&nbsp;</p> <p>Towering Republican heroes \u2013 political like Mitt Romney, military like John Kelly, both like John McCain \u2013 have come under Trump\u2019s withering attack.&nbsp;</p> <p>Trump\u2019s own former defense secretary, James Mattis, felt compelled to speak out against the treatment of American citizens during protests following the death of George Floyd at the hands of police. Comparing the president to Nazi propagandists, Mattis wrote: \u201cWe must reject and hold accountable those in office who would make a mockery of our constitution.\u201d</p> <p>Among other things Trump has asked evangelical Christians, his staunchest allies, to overlook lurid descriptions of his sexual escapades, hush money paid to a porn actor and \u2013 with difficulty \u2013 the abandonment of vulnerable Christian communities in northern Syria.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3c296bcbc3cd47717b2767d0ec0f34e1a3b904aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c296bcbc3cd47717b2767d0ec0f34e1a3b904aa/0_0_4087_2725/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump walks past police in Lafayette Park after the visit to St John\u2019s Church across from the White House.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump walks past police in Lafayette Park after the visit to St John\u2019s Church across from the White House.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick Semansky/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the most difficult demand of Trump\u2019s followers is unfolding now.</p> <p>For years, activists on the right railed against the possibility of US military deployment within the country\u2019s borders. A conspiracy theory about such a program \u2013 called \u201cJade Helm 15\u201d \u2013 grew so adamant that in 2015 Texas senator Ted Cruz requested an explanation from the Pentagon. It was a figment of the fevered rightwing imagination.</p> <p>But now, under Trump, the American self-invasion is coming true: squads of troops from agencies that normally oversee prisons, borders and drug enforcement have taken to the streets, often with no identifying insignia, to tamp down protests and riots. This week, active-duty troops mustered outside Washington, awaiting Trump\u2019s command.&nbsp;</p> <p>The troop build-up alarmed Mattis, a retired marine general.</p> <p>\u201cMilitarizing our response, as we witnessed in Washington DC, sets up a conflict \u2013 a false conflict \u2013 between the military and civilian society,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIt erodes the moral ground that ensures a trusted bond between men and women in uniform and the society they are sworn to protect, and of which they themselves are a part.\u201d</p> <p>All these circumstances have converged to chip away at Trump\u2019s previously granite-hard base.</p> <p>Fuzzell, the regretful waiter in Kansas, is not alone.</p> <p>\u201cIf I were a Republican operative, I\u2019d be concerned about some of these numbers,\u201d said Natalie Jackson, director of research at the Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI).&nbsp;</p> <p>PRRI\u2019s latest poll shows Trump with an 11-point deficit to Biden. And underneath that margin, Jackson said, there are some previously unseen trends. For example, 47% of white voters with no college degree saw Trump favorably.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s an all-time low,\u201d Jackson said. In 2019 that rating had averaged 52%. \u201cIt\u2019s statistically significant.\u201d</p> <p>Much of the drop may be because those non-degreed white voters \u2013 Trump\u2019s hard core \u2013 have suffered mightily during the coronavirus outbreak.</p> <p>\u201cThey are more likely to work in the service industry, and are losing jobs at a higher rate, or going to work at a significant risk to their health,\u201d Jackson said.</p> <p>It\u2019s difficult to know, yet, how the current civil unrest may affect Trump\u2019s support. But the initial signs are not in his favor. PRRI researchers collected their information around the country between May 26 and 31. Midway through that span, protests reached an inflection point when rioters burned down the Minneapolis police\u2019s third precinct building.&nbsp;</p> <p>So the researchers, curious about the protests\u2019 effect, divided their polling into pre- and post-precinct-burning samples. Among all Republicans, Jackson said, Trump\u2019s favorability dropped a whopping 9% after the precinct fire, from 88% to 79%.&nbsp;</p> <p>Republican leaders have not turned against Trump, largely, but they have fallen silent. After Trump\u2019s photo with a Bible outside St John\u2019s, senators Mike Enzi of Wyoming and Rob Portman of Ohio <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kasie/status/1267865976818806784?s=21\">told NBC</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kasie/status/1267868881667993609?s=21\">separately</a>, they couldn\u2019t comment because they were \u201clate for lunch\u201d.</p> <p>Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JakeSherman/status/1267889477470560259\">said</a> he didn\u2019t want to \u201ccritique other people\u2019s performances\u201d.</p> <p>Cruz did offer criticism, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kasie/status/126787187692942131\">of a sort</a>. He leveled charges of abuse of power: \u201cBy the protesters, yes.\u201d</p> <p>But other Republican leaders, those who have less to fear from Trump, have begun to denounce him. The last Republican president, George W Bush, sided with the protesters with a clear reference to Trump. He <a href=\"https://www.bushcenter.org/about-the-center/newsroom/press-releases/2020/06/statement-by-president-george-w-bush.html\">wrote</a>: \u201cThe only way to see ourselves in a true light is to listen to the voices of so many who are hurting and grieving.

<strong>William Callaghan:</strong> </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>An air-and-ground search is continuing for a lost Victorian teenager with non-verbal autism, after life-threatening low temperatures overnight.</p> \n   <p>Hundreds of people are racing to find William Callaghan, 14, who became lost in steep and rugged terrain on Mount Disappointment about 2.20pm on Monday.</p> \n   <p>William became separated from his family wearing just blue trackpants and a hoodie ahead of a night where temperatures dropped below zero.</p> \n   <p>Acting Inspector Christine Lalor said the youngster had been walking to the summit with his family when he raced ahead.</p> \n   <p>Tuesday\u2019s clear, sunny sky kept hopes high of finding him after an air-and-ground search started on Monday afternoon.</p> \n   <p>But with another chilly night coming, fears for the boy are growing.</p> \n   <p>\u201cIt\u2019s going to be another cold evening again, hence ... it\u2019s vital that we try to find William before nightfall,\u201d Insp Lalor said. \u201c(His parents) are holding up as well as can be expected.\u201d</p> \n   <p>Search and Rescue Squad Senior Sergeant Greg Paul told reporters on Tuesday they were fighting against time, but remained hopeful.</p> \n   <p>The weather bureau expects the temperature on the exposed mountain to drop to zero degrees and -3C in the valleys overnight.</p> \n   <p>\u201cIt\u2019s quite life-threatening weather, but we have had people survived several nights in these weather conditions as well,\u201d he said.</p> \n   <p>\u201cLuke Shambrook, six years ago ... we found him on day five, he was alive and he\u2019s alive today.\u201d</p> \n   <p>A mix of four-wheel-drives, people on foot, motor bikes, horseback and those in the air are involved in the search.</p> \n   <p>More than 200 volunteers joined about 150 police and emergency services who are looking for William.</p> \n   <p>Sen Sgt Paul said the area had very thick bush from bushfire regrowth and it hampered searches, given the undergrowth.</p> \n   <p>But they were \u201cgiving it our best effort\u201d to search the steep terrain.</p> \n   <p>\u201cThe only advantage is ... there is an opportunity to stay a little bit warm if you can snuggle up in the undergrowth,\u201d he said.</p> \n   <p>William went missing without food and water and could have covered a lot of distance by now, police said.</p> \n   <p>He is very energetic and food-focused, with police believing he may have walked into a house to help himself to food, or tuck himself into a bed.</p> \n   <p>\u201cWilliam doesn\u2019t verbalise so if anyone finds him the best way to communicate with him is to be patient and calm,\u201d Acting Insp Lalor said, adding William taps his chest to communicate.</p> \n   <p>\u201cIf anyone in the area could check their homes, check their beds and any out houses to see if William is in those locations.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div>

acknowledge the racism he says he was subjected to during his playing career, AAP report.</p> \n  <p>The 33-year-old posted on social media today to detail his experiences during 10 years at the Magpies - which he said were inadequately dealt with.</p> \n  <p>Lumumba, who retired from football in 2016 after repeated concussion problems, said he endured a \u201cculture of racist jokes\u201d at the Magpies and that coach <strong>Nathan Buckley</strong> had not supported him when he spoke out against <strong>Eddie McGuire</strong> in 2013.</p> \n  <p>Club president McGuire had suggested on radio that Sydney\u2019s <strong>Adam Goodes</strong> could be used to promote the King Kong movie, and later apologised for doing so.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI spoke out against McGuire\u2019s racism on 28/5/2013 and was ostracised internally for doing so, particularly from Buckley, who stated, \u2018You threw the president under the bus\u2019,\u201d Lumumba said in a Facebook post.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThey viewed what I did as wrong, and remained unapologetic about it, and as a result, I was treated differently, for the worse.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIt had a negative effect on my mental health and general well-being.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWithout a support network within the club/league that could cater to my specific needs, I used psilocybin (mushrooms) out of desperation to deal with my distressed state, which subsequently helped me confront CFC over the issues.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Lumumba, who made his AFL debut in 2005, also reiterated the claim that he was called \u201cChimp\u201d by Collingwood teammates before being traded to Melbourne at the end of 2014.</p> \n  <p>That claim was publicly backed up by former Magpies teammate <strong>Andrew Krakouer</strong> in 2017.</p> \n  <p>Lumumba said the AFL and Collingwood did not have the capacity or desire to address the issues he raised.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThey were negligent and did not (take) their internal issues seriously,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>Lumumba played 199 games for Collingwood and added another 24 with Melbourne.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5edf30a18f083999a26dcd54\" class=\"block\"

People just cannot abide it. It\u2019s one thing to say, \u2018Oh, he\u2019s rough around the edges but he gets things done,\u2019 but now he\u2019s failing in so many dimensions that people are no longer tolerant of it.\u201d</p> <p>Some Republicans fear that Trump\u2019s unpopularity, which led to defeat in the House of Representatives in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-midterm-elections-2018\">2018</a>, could cost them their Senate seats in November. Wilson added: \u201cHis political standing has collapsed so greatly that it\u2019s easier for these folks to not feel the same risk level. There\u2019s going to come a point very soon where having a nasty tweet from the president is a badge of honour and a tool of survival because my rule of \u2018everything Trump touches dies\u2019 is real.</p> <p>\u201cThe people that are trying to get away from it now, I think, are going to end up in a better position than they would have been prior to this. There are many more people that are going to put daylight between themselves and this president because he is political herpes. They don\u2019t want to be touched by it.\u201d</p> <p>There are reasons to be cautious, however. Trump has the backing of more Republican elected officials than he did in 2016, with many having learned to bite their lips and be grateful for his tax cuts, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/28/donald-trump-judges-create-new-conservative-america-republicans\">conservative judges</a> and other policies.</p> <p>Those now criticising the president did not vote for him in 2016 either, and Romney pinned his colours to the mast when he was the sole Republican to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qS-aFfJe20U\">vote for Trump\u2019s removal from office</a> after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-impeachment\">impeachment</a> trial. Moreover, attacks from party elders have sometimes been counterproductive, reinforcing Trump\u2019s image as a Washington outsider who will shake up the status quo.</p> <p>The president\u2019s base remains solid, and his \u201claw and order\u201d response to the protests is likely to harden it even further. In a recent <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/poll-trump-loses-ground-key-2016-voters-n1226971\">NBC News/ Wall Street Journal poll,</a> Biden stands at 49% and Trump at 42%, though among self-identified Republicans, the margin is 92% to 4% in favour of the president.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/07/politics/trump-base-analysis/index.html\">A CNN analysis noted that,</a> since 2000, no Republican ever had more than 91% of Republicans supporting him at this point in ABC News/ Washington Post polling. But Trump is faring worse at this point with independents and Democrats than any Republican over the same period. The base alone may not be enough to secure a second electoral college win.</p> <p>Despite a global pandemic, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy\">economic</a> slump and mass protests, Trump, who in April tweeted that Mutiny on the Bounty was one of his favourite films, has been quick to crush any signs of rebellion.

  "<p>A sense of place often has a political edge in Latin American writing. Even magic realism \u2013 which takes fantastic liberties with the contours of cities and <em>pueblos</em>, jungles and rivers \u2013 is rooted in the living, breathing, dying and warring world of its characters. Over five centuries, Hispanic authors have loaned from and contested European ideas about their world, adapting imported traditions (from naturalism to crime fiction to stream-of-consciousness) and reworking them to bring to life the vibrancy and vicissitudes of their youthful continent. The best novels are as alluring and stimulating as the most atmospheric places. To choose just 10 was only possible by imagining I was packing for a long road trip with limited baggage.

Gallegos details every tremble of palm frond, every ripple of skulking alligator. The novel, somewhat forgotten but a classic, inspired many of the later magic realists. In 1948 its author became president in what is widely regarded as Venezuela\u2019s first legitimate election. Some critics have said the character of Do\u00f1a B\u00e1rbara anticipated Eva Per\u00f3n, while Hugo Ch\u00e1vez was wont to call George W Bush \u201cSe\u00f1or Peligro\u201d, or \u201cMr Danger\u201d, after the novel\u2019s imperialist villain.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Tierra-del-Fuego-Iparraguirre/dp/1880684721\">Tierra del Fuego by Sylvia Iparraguirre</a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"334dfa8f3d085c3b4197d438bb4ce824860bf20f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/334dfa8f3d085c3b4197d438bb4ce824860bf20f/0_0_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Landscape of Carbajal valley, Tierra del Fuego\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carbajal valley, Tierra del Fuego.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Claudio Vidri/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This accomplished historical novel, published in 1998, retells the story of the abduction of Jemmy Button and three other indigenous Fuegians by Captain Robert Fitzroy of HMS Beagle.

But it is significant, the reader said, because of Vidor\u2019s reputation.</p> \n  <p>Here\u2019s an <a href=\"https://www.texasmonthly.com/news/black-lives-matter-vidor/\">excerpt from the Texas Monthly magazine</a>, which covered the protest:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Vidor has been known for many things\u2014among them the activities of the local Ku Klux Klan; its status as a \u201csundown town,\u201d in which blacks were not allowed in city limits after dark; and an ugly fight in the early nineties over a federal effort to desegregate public housing in the city, which caused <em>Texas Monthly,</em> in <a href=\"https://www.texasmonthly.com/articles/vidor-in-black-and-white/\">a cover story</a> that year, to describe Vidor as Texas\u2019s \u201cmost hate-filled town.\u201d The census <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/vidorcitytexas/PST120219\">estimates it</a> to be 91 percent white. </p> \n   <p>So when word started to circulate that a Black Lives Matter rally was being planned in Vidor, many people on social media thought it was a trap\u2014and expressed skepticism the event\u2019s supposed planner, 23-year-old Maddy Malone, even existed. (She <a href=\"https://www.texasmonthly.com/news/a-qa-with-the-organizer-of-the-black-lives-matter-march-in-vidor/\">does</a>.) To black folks with knowledge of the region, who had been told never to stop in Vidor, the idea seemed insane. \u201cA civil rights rally in Vidor\u201d is the punchline to a joke, not a thing that could happen in this world.

Yet annexation had continued into the modern era. Indonesia <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/30/east-timor-indonesias-invasion-and-the-long-road-to-independence\">annexed East Timor</a> in 1975, Iraq briefly annexed Kuwait in 1990, Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. Israel, too, has joined the club. In 1980, it annexed majority Palestinian East Jerusalem, and a year later, it annexed the Golan Heights, captured from Syria.</p> <p>In short, annexation is when a country declares that a piece of land outside its borders is part of the state. Often this is done after military occupation and whether the people living there want it or not. International law is <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=24716&amp;LangID=E\">fairly clear</a> about annexation \u2013 it is illegal.</p> <h2>What precisely does Israel want to annex?</h2> <p>Netanyahu has made repeated promises during the past year to annex, or \u201capply sovereignty\u201d, to different areas of the West Bank, a chunk of land Israel captured from Jordan in 1967.</p> <p>In April last year, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/apr/07/netanyahu-vows-to-annexe-jewish-settlements-in-occupied-west-bank\">Netanyahu said he planned to annex Jewish settlements</a>, outposts in the West Bank where hundreds of thousands of Israelis live, to global condemnation. In September, the Israeli leader <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/10/netanyahu-vows-annex-large-parts-occupied-west-bank-trump\">added he would also annex the Jordan Valley</a>, which makes up to one-third of the West Bank and borders Jordan.</p> <h2>Doesn\u2019t Israel already control that land?</h2> <p>Yes. Israel has run a military occupation for more than half a century that has created a situation in which <a href=\"https://www.nad.ps/en/media-room/press-releases/dr-saeb-erekat-ongoing-israeli-settlement-announcements-occupied-palestine\">Palestinian officials say</a> there is already de facto annexation.</p> <p>The country has deepened its grip over the land, squeezing many of the roughly 2.5 million West Bank Palestinians into urban enclaves. It has also established a robust civilian presence. Foreign tourists visiting Israel on bus trips to the Dead Sea drive right through the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/palestinian-territories\">Palestinian territories</a>&nbsp;without realising they have left the country. West Bank road signs often display Hebrew and frequently ignore Palestinian communities, pointing out Israeli settlements instead. Many factories, petrol stations and shops are Israeli-run.</p> <h2>So why now?</h2> <p>Ultranationalists in Israel see Trump\u2019s presidency as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to carry out measures that were long considered taboo in Washington.</p> <p>Going against decades of US foreign policy, Trump has slashed aid to Palestinians,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/10/palestinian-officials-washington-diplomatic-mission\">cut</a>&nbsp;diplomatic ties and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/dec/06/donald-trump-us-jerusalem-israel-capital\">declared</a>&nbsp;the city of Jerusalem \u2013 part of which Palestinians claim \u2013 as Israel\u2019s capital.</p> <p>With Trump\u2019s White House tenancy potentially due to expire in a November election, much of the far-right in Israel believes now is the time for action.</p> <h2>Is it definitely going to happen?</h2> <p>Annexation was a key pledge made by Netanyahu during election campaigns over the past year. Under&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/17/netanyahu-takes-office-in-deal-that-could-see-west-bank-annexation\">a unity government deal</a>, the Israeli leader has pushed to bring plans for annexation&nbsp;to the cabinet for discussion as soon as 1 July.</p> <p>However, weeks from that date Netanyahu has still not articulated exactly what he plans to do.</p> <p>Netanayhu\u2019s unofficial biographer, Anshel Pfeffer, believes the 70-year-old leader will never go ahead with annexation, which has already attracted considerable international opposition.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen because Netanyahu doesn\u2019t really want annexation. At least not now,\u201d he <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-there-will-be-lots-of-annexation-talk-from-netanyahu-but-no-action-1.8826440\">wrote</a>. \u201cNetanyahu had focused on the promise of annexation as a lever to bring out the right-wing base to the ballot box \u2026 But Netanyahu doesn\u2019t need it to win an election anymore.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"18477d08aaf4429a5d151d3c1a7986cb435e31b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18477d08aaf4429a5d151d3c1a7986cb435e31b1/0_116_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstrators protest under coronavirus restrictions against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s plan to annex parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, in Tel Aviv, Israel 6 June 6 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstrators protest under coronavirus restrictions against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s plan to annex parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, in Tel Aviv, Israel 6 June 6 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amir Cohen/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>What will the effect be if it does go ahead?</h2> <p>Jordan\u2019s king has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/17/netanyahu-takes-office-in-deal-that-could-see-west-bank-annexation\">hinted</a> that an Israeli-Jordanian peace agreement would be in jeopardy.

Many who still support the idea of a \u201ctwo-state solution\u201d say annexation would be the killing blow, although <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/13/one-state-solution-gains-ground-as-palestinians-battle-for-equal-rights\">others argue</a> that ideal perished years ago.</p> <p>One significant change may be one of perception. Israel\u2019s half-century occupation of the West Bank has long been referred to as something that is temporary. That has allowed Israel to deflect thorny questions around why Israeli settlers in the West Bank have citizenship, while Palestinians do not.</p> <p>If Israel was to annex so much of the West Bank that it would effectively and permanently control the land and all the people in it, then questions around inequality under the law might be more difficult to answer.</p> <p>Benjamin Pogrund, a South African-born Israeli writer and former ally of Nelson Mandela, has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/benjaminpogrund\">long argued against the use of the term \u201capartheid\u201d</a> to describe Israel\u2019s treatment of West Bank Palestinians.</p> <p>But in an interview with the Times of Israel last week, <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/annexation-will-mean-apartheid-warns-mandela-ally-who-always-fought-comparison/\">he said</a> annexation would change his assessment.</p> <p>\u201c[At] least it has been a military occupation. Now we are going to put other people under our control and not give them citizenship. That is apartheid. That is an exact mirror of what apartheid was [in South Africa].\u201d</p>",

The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, called the suggestion \u201coutlandish\u201d. And the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GOPLeader/status/1270006990740348935?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet\">promised</a> police officers \u201cRepublicans will never turn our backs on you\u201d, unveiling a new line of attack ahead of the November elections.</p> <p>Calls to reform, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/05/defunding-the-police-us-what-does-it-mean\">defund</a> and abolish the police have been embraced by protesters and activists amid a national upheaval in response to the police killings of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a> in Minneapolis and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/breonna-taylor-louisville-police-shooting-kentucky\">Breonna Taylor</a> in Louisville, both of whom were African American. But Trump, his re-election campaign and his Republican allies are seizing on the movement in an effort to weaponize the rallying cry against Democrats and the party\u2019s nominee, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden\">Joe Biden</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/04/american-police-violence-against-black-people\">US police have a history of violence against black people. Will it ever stop?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe president is appalled by the \u2018defund the police\u2019 movement,\u201d the White House press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, said on Monday. She compared it to past calls to abolish US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) ahead of the 2018 congressional midterms, which resulted in Democrats regaining control of the House.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s remarkable to hear this coming from today\u2019s Democrat party,\u201d she continued, declining to say whether the president supported any specific policing reforms.&nbsp;</p> <p>The effort to turn the national debate over racism and policing so that it works against Democrats comes as Trump continues to fall behind Biden in key battleground states, according to several recent polls, amid his incendiary response to the mass protests against police brutality and his widely criticized handling of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus</a> pandemic.&nbsp;</p> <p>Though Democrats have vowed to curb the powers of the police, few support&nbsp;defunding police departments.<strong> </strong>On Monday, Biden distanced himself from the slogan while embracing the growing activism around reforms in policing and criminal justice.&nbsp;</p> <p>Biden \u201chears and shares the deep grief and frustration of those calling out for change\u201d and \u201csupports the urgent need for reform\u201d, a campaign spokesman, Andrew Bates, said in a statement on Monday. But he stated bluntly that Biden \u201cdoes not believe that police should be defunded\u201d.</p> <p>Bates said the former vice president, who on Monday met privately with the family of George Floyd in Houston, believes that coupling additional funding for \u201cpublic schools, summer programs, and mental health and substance abuse treatment\u201d with support for police departments would lead to improved outcomes.</p> <p>In stark contrast, Trump has implored law enforcement to \u201cdominate\u201d the streets where Americans were marching en masse against police brutality and racism.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cLAW &amp; ORDER, NOT DEFUND AND ABOLISH THE POLICE,\u201d Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1269970808329437185\">tweeted</a> on Monday. \u201cThe Radical Left Democrats have gone Crazy!\u201d</p> <p>Later, at a roundtable with law enforcement officials at the White House, Trump declared: \u201cWe won\u2019t be defunding our police. There won\u2019t be dismantling of our police. There\u2019s not going to be any disbanding of our police.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>He conceded that the nation had witnessed \u201csome horrible things\u201d at the hands of police officers but insisted that virtually all \u2013&nbsp;\u201clet\u2019s go with 99%\u201d \u2013 of them&nbsp;are \u201cgreat, great people.\u201d</p> <p>Republicans sense an opportunity to portray Democrats as extremists eager to disband police departments, while driving a wedge between energized protesters and elected officials advocating for more incremental change.</p> <p>Yet many supporters of the campaign to defund the police say it isn\u2019t necessarily about dismantling police departments or stripping them entirely of funding. Rather they say it is an effort to address systemic problems in policing by radically re-prioritizing community budgets to divert funding from law enforcement to programs related to mental health, poverty and education.&nbsp;</p> <p>And as protests continue to swell in cities across the country, their political influence was apparent. On Sunday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/08/minneapolis-city-council-police-department-dismantle\">a veto-proof majority of the Minneapolis City Council</a> pledged to dismantle the city\u2019s police department, promising to replace it with a new community-based system of public safety. Meanwhile, several major cities, including Los Angeles and New York, are already considering changes to their policing budgets while others are considering policy changes.&nbsp;</p> <p>Democrats on Monday forged ahead with a far-reaching plan to overhaul policing in America, called the Justice in Policing Act of 2020. The plan would make it easier to prosecute police misconduct when officers violate a citizen\u2019s civil rights, limit the transfer of military weaponry to state and local departments and put pressure on the justice department to address racial profiling and systemic racial bias in policing.</p> <p>Though the legislation has galvanized Democrats, it remains unclear if congressional Republicans will join the effort, particularly in the Senate.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re already seeing outlandish calls, defund the police. Abolish the police,\u201d McConnell said in a speech on the Senate floor Monday that did not address the Democrats\u2019 proposal. \u201cI think you may want a police officer to arrest a criminal before you try to work through his feelings.\u201d</p>"
