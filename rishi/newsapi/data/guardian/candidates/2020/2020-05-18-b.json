On Monday, the country posted 8,926 new cases, the lowest in weeks.</p> \n  <p>But concerns about the actual death toll of the disease have grown amid worrying reports from Dagestan and several other regions of hundreds of deaths from pneumonia, many of whom may have been infected with coronavirus but not tallied due to Russia\u2019s conservative autopsy standards. The country has tallied just 2,722 deaths from the disease.</p> \n  <p>The health minister of Dagestan, a southern Russian region of nearly three million people, said on Sunday that while officially 29 people in the republic had died of Covid-19, another 657 people had died of \u201ccommunity-acquired pneumonia,\u201d a sickness often contracted by those infected with coronavirus.</p> \n  <p>He also confirmed that more than 40 medics in Dagestan had died since the coronavirus crisis began, a concern that had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/painful-to-see-rise-in-russian-medics-falling-prey-to-covid-19-as-death-toll-questioned\">raised concerns across Russia</a>, but claimed that many had died of causes other than coronavirus.</p> \n  <p>Other regions also appeared to indicate that death rates from pneumonia were many times higher than from coronavirus. The St. Petersburg governor also announced late last week that 694 people had died from pneumonia since 1 March, while just 63 people had officially died of coronavirus and been added to Russia\u2019s tally of deaths from the disease.</p> \n  <p>Russia\u2019s mortality rate from the disease is considerably lower than other countries with more than 100,000 infections. The Kremlin has said that is attributable to the country\u2019s medical system, while critics have noted that deaths are tallied differently than in most countries in Europe and North America. New data from Moscow last week indicated <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/coronavirus-russia-defends-its-exceptionally-precise-covid-19-death-data\">nearly 1,600 people with coronavirus</a> had died since the outbreak began, but that just 639 were included on official death tolls from the disease after autopsies found other causes of death.</p> \n  <p>Many academics believe that excess death rates are the best way to evaluate the total death toll from the disease.

the situation is stabilising. </p> \n  <p>Health officials reported 8,926 new infections in the last 24 hours, bringing the country\u2019s total to 290,678, the second-highest in the world after the <strong>United States</strong>. </p> \n  <p>It was the lowest number of new virus cases since 1 May, when Russia announced 7,933 cases. </p> \n  <p>Russia\u2019s consumer health watchdog chief,

At least 315,187<strong> </strong>people have died over the course of the pandemic The number of deaths in the US is approaching 90,000, with 89,562 confirmed fatalities and 1,486,757 infections, according to the Johns Hopkins university tracker.</li> \n   <li><strong>US Federal Reserve Chair says unemployment could reach 25%. </strong>US Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Sunday that US unemployment could peak at 25%, but expressed optimism that the economy could begin to recover from a devastating recession in the second half of the year, assuming the coronavirus doesn\u2019t erupt in a second wave.</li> \n   <li><strong>Japan </strong><strong>falls into recession. </strong>Japan dived into its first recession since 2015, according to official data on Monday, with the world\u2019s third-largest economy contracting by 0.9% in the first quarter as it wrestled with the fallout from the coronavirus. The cabinet office reported a drop of 3.4% annual pace in seasonally adjusted real gross domestic product, or GDP, the total value of a nation\u2019s goods and services, for the January-March period, compared with the previous quarter.</li> \n   <li><strong>South Africa reports highest daily increase in cases. </strong>South Africa on Sunday reported 1,160 new coronavirus infections, the highest daily number since the first case was recorded in March \u201cAs of today, the total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in South Africa is 15,515, with 1,160 new cases identified in the last 24 hour cycle of testing,\u201d the health ministry said in a statement.

Brazil has the fourth-highest number of infections worldwide, with 241,080, according to Johns Hopkins University figures. It has recorded 16,118 deaths. Meanwhile, Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro greeted hundreds of supporters and joined some in a series of push-ups who gathered before the presidential offices Sunday.</li> \n   <li><strong>Death tolls fall in UK, Spain and Italy. </strong>In a possible glimmer of hope, Sunday saw lower death tolls reported in the UK, Spain and Italy. The UK\u2019s daily coronavirus death toll was the lowest since lockdown began, with 170 deaths recorded. However, the Sunday and Monday figures tend to be lower than other days because of weekend testing rates. Meanwhile, Spain<strong> </strong>recorded its lowest single-day death toll in two months. Italy on Sunday recorded its lowest daily toll, 145, since lockdown was declared. There were 153 deaths registered during the previous 24 hour period.</li> \n   <li><strong>Move Rohingya on Bangladesh island to refugee camps, says UN chief. </strong>Hundreds of Rohingya rescued by Bangladesh and sent to a flood-prone island after being stranded at sea for weeks should be moved to existing refugee camps, the UN secretary general has said. </li> \n   <li><strong>WHO committee to discuss Taiwan exclusion. </strong>The World Health Organization (WHO) is to raise the question of Taiwan\u2019s participation as an observer at the World Health Assembly, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/world-health-assembly-what-is-it-and-what-is-the-coronavirus-inquiry-china-taiwan-origins\">which opens virtually on Monday</a>, before one of its committees. Diplomatic allies of Taiwan, including Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Paraguay, have formally requested to invite Taiwan to the meeting as an observer. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has also said publicly he wants Taiwan in the room.</li> \n   <li><strong>India extends lockdown by another two weeks. </strong>India has extended its lockdown to 31 May, but with some easing of restrictions. States are being given greater power to reopen markets and standalone stores, bus and other public transport travel being allowed between and within states.

The UK\u2019s daily coronavirus death toll was the lowest since lockdown began, with 170 deaths recorded. This should be taken with a pinch of salt: due to hospital reporting delays, the numbers reported on Sundays and Mondays tend to be lower than other days. Meanwhile Spain<strong> </strong>has recorded its lowest single-day death toll in two months. Italy on Sunday recorded its lowest daily toll, 145, since lockdown was declared.

It analyzed the cases of 368 male coronavirus patients nationwide, 97 receiving hydroxychloroquine, 113 receiving hydroxychloroquine in combination with the antibiotic azithromycin, and 158 not receiving any hydroxychloroquine. This was not a randomized clinical trial, the gold standard of drug testing, which would randomly assign hydroxychloroquine treatment to some patients and not to others. Instead, researchers looked back on cases \u2013 and weren\u2019t able to account for why doctors chose to treat some patients with the antimalarial drug and not others.

Earlier confirmed cases than the previously known first infected case have continuously been found in the US. Among those diagnosed as having flu last winter, how many were coronavirus infections? All these clues shouldn\u2019t be missed.</p> \n   <p>Investigating the origin of the virus is only one part of the coronavirus fight. The ultimate goal is to control the pandemic and resume production globally. China is one of the countries that have done well in both. How could China be passive and isolated in WHA? It is the US that should feel it failed the international community.</p> \n   <p><strong>The proposal that will eventually be adopted by the assembly will not be one that only meets US requests.

  "<p>Just three months ago, centrist Democrats were panicking. After strong performances in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada, the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders appeared poised to sail away with the nomination for president. Some in the party feared the self-identified democratic socialist would wreak havoc down the ballot.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/23/susan-collins-maine-democrats-kavanaugh-controversy\">Could Susan Collins' vote for Kavanaugh help the Democrats flip the Senate in 2020?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIf Bernie Sanders was at the top of the ticket, we would be in jeopardy of losing the House,\u201d the Louisiana congressman Cedric Richmond, a co-chair of Joe Biden\u2019s campaign, said on a February conference call. \u201cWe would not get the Senate back.\u201d</p> <p>The world looks different now \u2013 and so does the Senate map. With Biden the presumptive nominee and Donald Trump facing widespread criticism for his handling of the coronavirus crisis, election experts say the upper chamber is up for grabs.</p> <p>Republicans hold a 53-47 advantage, meaning Democrats will have to flip at least three seats to take the majority, assuming they win the White House. If they can\u2019t win the presidency, they will need four seats to control the Senate. Doug Jones, a Democrat, is considered an underdog for re-election in Alabama. If he loses, Democrats will need another Republican seat.</p> <p>But Jones\u2019s race is one of only a few chances for Republicans to flip a seat themselves. Other Democrats up for re-election, such as Gary Peters in Michigan, have started to pull ahead. The map is unfavorable for Republicans, with incumbents facing difficult re-election races in presidential battleground states like Arizona, Colorado and North Carolina.</p> <p>\u201cOver the course of the last several months the playing field has gotten a little bit bigger, and I\u2019d say Democratic prospects in some of these individual races have also seemed to get a little bit better,\u201d said Kyle Kondik, managing editor of <a href=\"http://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/\">Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball</a> at the University of Virginia Center for Politics.</p> <p>\u201cThe overall race for the Senate is more of a coin flip than maybe you would have described it at the start of the cycle.\u201d</p> <p>Democrats have managed to expand the map, in part thanks to Biden clearing the presidential primary field, which seems to have improved the party\u2019s prospects in states Trump carried in 2016, such as North Carolina and Georgia.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of Democrats were rightly worried that if you had a more progressive nominee, an avowed Democratic socialist on the ticket like Bernie Sanders, flipping a state like North Carolina \u2026 would have been much harder,\u201d said Jessica Taylor, Senate and governors editor for the <a href=\"https://cookpolitical.com/\">Cook Political Report</a>.</p> <p>Republicans are on defense in states they previously thought safe, most notably Montana. The state\u2019s Democratic governor, Steve Bullock, launched his Senate campaign in March.

But Snover does not see the president as having failed her family.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think people give him enough credit,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you think about what a businessman he was, and how much he loved that booming economy, do you know how hard it was for him to shut the country down? That was hard. So I give him credit for that.\u201d</p> <p>At times it has appeared that the pandemic, which has already taken at least 90,000 lives in the United States and wreaked havoc with the economy, would also destroy support for Trump, and his chances for reelection. But interviews with longtime Trump supporters in Northampton county indicate the extraordinary durability of backing for the president among his base.</p> <h2>The state that decides Trump\u2019s win</h2> <p>As part of his nascent return to the campaign trail during the pandemic, Trump made a trip to Snover\u2019s backyard, in Allentown, Pennsylvania, last week. He visited a medical equipment distributor and blasted Governor Tom Wolf, a Democrat, for not easing virus mitigation measures sooner.</p> <p>\u201cNext year is going to be through the roof,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe have to get your governor of Pennsylvania to start opening up a little bit. You have areas of Pennsylvania that are barely affected, and they have \u2013 they want to keep them closed.

Northampton, which borders Allentown and is the subject of an ongoing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/the-promise\">Guardian series</a>, was one of only three counties statewide to vote twice for Barack Obama before falling for Trump in 2016; handing him the massive electoral prize of Pennsylvania \u2013 and the presidency.</p> <p>If Trump can win here again, political analysts say, he has a good chance of holding the White House.</p> <p>Christopher Borick, director of the Institute of Public Opinion at Muhlenberg College in Allentown, said that the pandemic does not appear to have changed the race for Trump much in the Lehigh Valley.</p> <p>\u201cDespite this enormous thing happening, I don\u2019t see clear indicators that the race itself has changed here, in the sense that there\u2019s been only some modest movement in polls\u201d in recent months, Borick said. \u201cWhile the world has changed since the onset of the pandemic, the political calculus hasn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018We\u2019re lucky to get a president like him\u2019</h2> <p>Joe D\u2019Ambrosio, 79, who has cut hair in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, for more than 50 years, was also struck by tragedy this spring, when one of his best friends died from the virus.</p> <p>\u201cHe and his wife caught a cold,\u201d D\u2019Ambrosio said. \u201cHe was perfectly healthy, this was six weeks ago. She caught a cold, he caught a cold, so he said to his wife, \u2018I just can\u2019t breathe right\u2019. So they go to the hospital.\u201d</p> <p>His friend fought for a week. \u201cWhen you talk about two people from Minnesota that died from it, they\u2019re just statistics,\u201d D\u2019Ambrosio said. \u201cBut when they\u2019re close to you, then you realize how real this thing is.\u201d</p> <p>Like a lot of older Democrats in a town that was once home to the legendary \u2013 and heavily unionized \u2013 Bethlehem Steel, D\u2019Ambrosio voted for both parties over the years before coming out as an early and enthusiastic Trump supporter. That support has not changed.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, I think we\u2019re so lucky that at this time in our life, we were able to get a president like him, at the right time,\u201d D\u2019Ambrosio said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fbc0176703e2dcc0cf69f443202b1fa504f988e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fbc0176703e2dcc0cf69f443202b1fa504f988e0/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A protestor wears a Trump face mask while rallying against the coronavirus restrictions in Pennsylvania.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A protester wears a Trump face mask while rallying against the coronavirus restrictions in Pennsylvania.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He dismissed criticism that Trump had made the country complacent by advising that the virus would \u201cdisappear\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhat he did was damage control,\u201d D\u2019Ambrosio said. \u201cPeople were starting to panic, buying everything, emptying the stores. He got it to calm down.\u201d</p> <p>Pennsylvania has recorded more than 4,000 Covid-19 deaths, mostly in the Philadelphia metropolitan area. Last week Wolf announced an additional $16m in funding for food banks, where people have <a href=\"https://www.wtae.com/article/pennsylvanias-food-banks-getting-dollar16-million-in-funding/32196590\">queued up before dawn</a>, after the state shed about 2m jobs from mid-March onwards.</p> <p>Bruce Haines, a former steel executive who runs the Historic Hotel Bethlehem, a crown jewel of the local tourism industry, said business had plunged.</p> <p>\u201cIt was like you turned off a lightbulb,\u201d Haines said on the phone from Florida. \u201cThe cancellation calls the week of 9 March were incredible. And it hit us blindly, because we were coming off our best year ever in 2019.\u201d</p> <p>Haines praised Trump\u2019s move to reopen the economy. \u201cI think it\u2019s right on target, and it\u2019s necessary,\u201d Haines said. \u201cAnd anybody who\u2019s a businessman knows that Trump\u2019s the right guy there, to bring us out of this downturn. Because he\u2019s a businessman.\u201d</p> <h2>A downward trend</h2> <p>Peg Ferraro, a Republican official popular with Democrats who for years was the only woman on the county council, retired last year and also spoke on the phone from Florida.</p> <p>\u201cI think he\u2019s doing as well as could be expected under the circumstances, where you\u2019ve never been through it really before,\u201d she said of Trump. \u201cI think he was absolutely correct in leaving it up to the governors \u2013 they know their states better than making blanket statements for everybody.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s visit to Pennsylvania last Thursday represented a headache for Wolf, who is in an escalating war with Republican officials over reopening the state county by county. True to a national pattern, Republicans from more rural districts in the state are less likely to see the pandemic as dangerous than Democrats, Borick said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5202c018055aa247c65dfd6fb6d09086bd0d854a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5202c018055aa247c65dfd6fb6d09086bd0d854a/0_0_4931_3287/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump supporters hold signs highlighting their displeasure with Pennsylvania\u2019s governor.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump supporters hold signs highlighting their displeasure with Pennsylvania\u2019s governor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Rourke/Associated Press</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Trump could still lose in the Lehigh Valley. Public approval of his handling of the coronavirus crisis has plunged nationally from about 50% in late March to just over 40% now, with about 55% disapproving, <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/public_approval_of_president_trumps_handling_of_the_coronavirus-7088.html\">according to polling averages</a>. While there is plenty of time before the election to reverse that slide, polling in Pennsylvania <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/pennsylvania/\"> shows a similar trend</a>.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s margin of victory in 2016 in Northampton county was narrow, spurred by record turnout. And his opponent in that race, Hillary Clinton, was disliked by voters in a way that Joe Biden, the presumed Democratic nominee, who grew up in Pennsylvania, does not appear to be.</p> <p>The unique logistics of the fall election could also go a long way in deciding the victor here, Borick said. Just last year, Pennsylvania for the first time approved absentee voting for everyone, potentially throwing the advantage in November to the party that shows better organization at standing up vote-by-mail and at getting people to the polls amid a potential second pandemic wave.</p> <p>And for all the president\u2019s support in the region, there is a resistance to Trump that is as galvanized as his base.</p> <p>\u201cHe couldn\u2019t run a one-car funeral,\u201d said Frank Behum, a former unionized steelworker and vocal Trump critic.</p> <p>\u201cEven my Republican friends, they\u2019re telling me they\u2019re not voting for that clown again. But you don\u2019t know \u2013 remember in the 1980s, people said they\u2019re not voting for Reagan either.</p> <p>\u201cSo you don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to do.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The Rev Jesse Jackson was born in the racially segregated south when Franklin Roosevelt occupied the White House and war raged in Europe. He was an eyewitness to the assassination of Martin Luther King, campaigned against the Vietnam war and twice ran for US president.</p> <p>But, now an elder statesman of 78, he has never seen anything like the coronavirus pandemic, which has infected more than 1 million Americans and killed more in April alone than died in Vietnam over 15 years. The world\u2019s most powerful and wealthy country also bears by far its biggest death toll: almost 90,000. It is enough to shake faith in American exceptionalism.</p> <p>\u201cOur military cannot defeat this germ,\u201d Jackson says by phone from Chicago, one of the hardest-hit cities. \u201cHaving the biggest banks, having the biggest military has no meaning in this kind of germ warfare. The frontline is not soldiers; the frontline is doctors and nurses. The planes are grounded, the bombs are irrelevant. It turns out that pride precedes a fall. Sometimes people have to learn that we don\u2019t control everything.\u201d</p> <p>Despite lockdown and Parkinson\u2019s disease, Jackson is still working with gusto at the Rainbow Push Coalition, a progressive organisation he founded in 1996. It has convened thousands of black doctors and lawyers and released a manifesto suggesting that high-risk groups, including African Americans, be prioritised for coronavirus testing.</p> <p>Jackson has twice written to Donald Trump urging testing for the 2.2 million people currently in prison. At a time when most Americans are looking inward, he has also called for massive intervention in Africa, a particularly vulnerable continent that is close to his heart.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"55dddb9dfcb17798d138912412644c022255a838\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/55dddb9dfcb17798d138912412644c022255a838/25_33_1319_1965/671.jpg\" alt=\"Jesse Jackson in 1988 in the battle for the Democratic presidential nomination.\" width=\"671\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jesse Jackson in 1988 in the battle for the Democratic presidential nomination.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cynthia Johnson/The LIFE Images Collection via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe\u2019re working virtually, making conference calls, using this time to organise people,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked to about 2,000 ministers around the nation over the past 10 days, trying to convince their congregations to honour the protocols and stay in the house.\u201d</p> <p>For a brief while it became voguish to indulge a comforting myth that the coronavirus was the great equaliser, touching the bus driver and Prince of Wales alike. But while infections do not discriminate, humans do. Despite making up only 13% of the US population, African Americans represent 30% of the deaths from the coronavirus.</p> <p>A Senate Democratic Policy and Communications Committee <a href=\"https://www.democrats.senate.gov/dpcc/press-reports/dpcc-report-racial-disparities-on-full-displaycovid-19-is-disproportionately-affecting-communities-of-color\">report </a><a href=\"https://www.democrats.senate.gov/dpcc/press-reports/dpcc-report-racial-disparities-on-full-displaycovid-19-is-disproportionately-affecting-communities-of-color\">last month concluded</a> that people of colour have less access to quality healthcare, are more likely to have a pre-existing health condition and suffer greater exposure to air pollution that puts them at higher risk of asthma. They also make up a disproportionate share of frontline workers, are less likely to be able to work from home and more likely to rely on public transport, and are hit hardest by poverty as layoffs continue to rise.</p> <p>\u201cWe know that people should honour the [social distancing] protocols, but some find it more difficult because of congested conditions or their transportation,\u201d says Jackson. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/los-angeles-coronavirus-inequality-undocumented-healthcare\">A lot are untested and uninsured</a>.

It shows the black condition in America. The legacy of slavery and Jim Crow is very clear.\u201d</p> <p>Like Trump\u2019s regressive presidency, the virus is a shock to the system that forces a confrontation with class, race and structural inequality. What had been ambient noise for the privileged is suddenly vividly clear and difficult to ignore.</p> <p>\u201cAfter 400 years of slavery, segregation and discrimination, why would anybody be shocked that African Americans are dying disproportionately from the coronavirus?\u201d Jackson <a href=\"https://chicagocrusader.com/why-are-african-americans-dying-disproportionately-to-the-coronavirus/\">asked in a statement published on 7 April</a>, arguing that all past US presidents have failed to \u201cend the virus of white superiority and fix the multifaceted issues confronting African Americans\u201d.</p> <p>He adds, by phone: \u201cAmerica has decided the place of blacks in this society, which is beneath that of European immigrants.

We\u2019re still looked upon as the other based upon skin colour, as some kind of irreparable sin in the society. People try to adjust to it but, when a pandemic sets in, the data comes out.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re about 60% of prisoners in this country. People are sick behind those walls. You can have 200 inmates sick with Covid-19 and the workers go home and they spread it. So the prisons become the epicentre of the untreated and untested and undetected.\u201d</p> <p>Itching to revive their economies, several southern states led by mostly white male governors are already reopening bowling alleys, cinemas, hairdressers, restaurants and other outlets against federal guidelines. A <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/gdpr-consent/?next_url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.washingtonpost.com%2fpolitics%2f2020%2f04%2f28%2fblack-activists-officials-see-major-threat-souths-plans-reopen%2f\">group of activists</a>, mostly black women, warned in a petition that reopening now \u201cis irresponsible and a death sentence for many of us\u201d.</p> <p>White privilege will offer no immunity in an interconnected society, says Jackson. \u201cIf blacks are the drivers and unprotected, the driven are hurt. If the cooks and waiters are unprotected, those they cook for are all unprotected. So we\u2019re more integrated than we realise on a daily basis.</p> <p>\u201cSo we really must have healthcare for all as one of the by-products of this pandemic. Anybody who\u2019s left out is a threat to those who are left in. When people as affluent as Prince Charles and Boris Johnson and athletes are affected, it means that the gated community did not protect you from the pandemic. If the poor are not protected, the rich are in jeopardy, because you cannot separate by community the poor from the rich, the white from the black.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e0dbd14c23583b71911f99a88a27e694605d5ec8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e0dbd14c23583b71911f99a88a27e694605d5ec8/608_479_2392_1668/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Martin Luther King in 1968 a day before King\u2019s assassination at the same spot.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"697\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Martin Luther King in 1968 a day before King\u2019s assassination at the same spot.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charles Kelly/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Roosevelt was tested by the Great Depression and second world war and rose to the challenge.

The infrastructure that [George W] Bush and Barack had put together on pandemics was ignored. He dismantled the infrastructure and did not pay adequate attention to the threat.</p> <p>\u201cAs the threat changed, we didn\u2019t have ventilators and respirators. All our preparation was for a financial fight or a military fight. He should have declared a national testing mechanism. There should have been a national lockdown to break the back of it. The attention should have been early; it was not.\u201d</p> <p>Trump has sought absolution at press briefings that sometimes run for more than two hours with a mix of self-congratulation, bloated exaggerations, broadsides at reporters and bad science. He recently ad libbed a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/25/donald-trump-coronavirus-disinfectant-sarcastic-tipping-point\">jaw-dropping proposal to study the merits of injecting disinfectant into coronavirus patients</a>.

Biden\u2019s campaign fell apart after he quoted without attribution the then British Labour leader, Neil Kinnock, and was accused of plagiarism. Jackson, bidding to become the US\u2019s first black president, gathered 7m votes and finished first or second in 46 out of 54 primary contests. But he lost the nomination to Michael Dukakis, who went down to George HW Bush.</p> <p>Does it hurt that he will never be president? \u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t,\u201d he says firmly, \u201cbecause I was a trailblazer, I was a pathfinder. I had to deal with doubt and cynicism and fears about a black person running. There were black scholars writing papers about why I was wasting my time. Even blacks said a black couldn\u2019t win.\u201d</p> <p>Some of his foreign policy positions at the time, he points out, became widely adopted: a two-state solution for Israel and the Palestinians, the release of Nelson Mandela from prison in South Africa (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/08/thatcher-advisers-suspicious-jesse-jackson-visit\">he met Margaret Thatcher to plead for Britain</a> to drop its support for the apartheid regime). In 2000 he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the US\u2019s highest civilian honour.</p> <p>When Obama won in 2008, he praised Jackson for making his run possible. As Obama delivered his election night victory speech at Grant Park in Chicago before a crowd of 240,000, Jackson\u2019s tear-stained face was among the most indelible images. \u201cIt was a big moment in history,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI cried because I thought about those who made it possible who were not there \u2026 People who paid a real price: Ralph Abernathy, Dr King, Medgar Evers, Fannie Lou Hamer, those who fought like hell [at the Democratic national convention] in Atlantic City in 64, those in the movement in the south.\u201d </p> <p>Some felt that Obama should have pushed faster and further on racial justice in his two terms. But Jackson ranks him among the US\u2019s top presidents. \u201cFirst, given America\u2019s history in terms of race, he inspired indescribable pride. No 2, his family and their decency and dignity were a big deal.\u201d</p> <p>He points to the Paris climate accords, Iran nuclear deal, rapprochement with Cuba and rescue of the economy as signal achievements. \u201cHe stabilised the ship when the ship was sinking and got it back above the water. And no scandal. Trump creates a desire for Barack all over again. When he travelled around the world, he was the best face America\u2019s ever had.\u201d</p> <p>In March, Jackson endorsed Bernie Sanders, returning a compliment from 1988 when Sanders backed his campaign. \u201cHis ideas made the most sense to me,\u201d he explains. But after a promising start Sanders fell away, partly because of his failure to connect with older African American voters, where Biden dominated.</p> <p>\u201cHis campaign was [about] class without appreciating the caste dimension of poverty,\u201d Jackson explains by way of post-mortem. \u201cThere are 55 black members of Congress and he didn\u2019t have one. Maybe one or two black mayors, but he didn\u2019t cultivate an African American constituency.\u201d</p> <p>Biden, meanwhile, benefited from his \u201ckinship\u201d with Obama as well as Trump\u2019s repeated attacks that kept his profile up and his name on the front pages. \u201cThe opposition had no infrastructure for the black vote. In many ways, he inherited votes he didn\u2019t campaign for.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d1c0ab365ca2b0e711ca6df5ee832b9671430bc7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1c0ab365ca2b0e711ca6df5ee832b9671430bc7/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Bernie Sanders in March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Bernie Sanders in March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scott Olson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In recent weeks, Biden has been endorsed by Sanders, Obama, Hillary Clinton, House speaker Nancy Pelosi and the civil rights hero John Lewis in a show of party unity. Will Jackson support him enthusiastically? \u201cYeah, as an alternative to the present administration, but we\u2019ve not had a meeting with the black constituency on what our demands are.\u201d</p> <p>The ground is shifting under Trump and Biden\u2019s feet. Sanders argues that the pandemic, which has put more than 30 million Americans out of work, shows the failure of the US healthcare system. As an opportunity to reimagine the social contract, the present moment is being compared with Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal or the post second-world-war consensus in Britain.</p> <p>\u201cBiden won the delegates but Sanders won the issues,\u201d Jackson reflects. \u201cSanders\u2019 agenda will dominate the [Democratic national] convention. One of the by-products of this pandemic is going to be the need for healthcare for all. We can\u2019t afford not to have healthcare for all because if you see the gap between the 1% and 99%, the 1% can\u2019t hide from who it is that\u2019s caring for the masses. The real soldiers are not the investment bankers. It\u2019s the doctors and nurses. There is a new appreciation of the common people, doctors and janitors and truck drivers, what they call essential workers.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn many ways,\u201d he says, \u201cas African Americans, we\u2019re at the the bottom of the foundation. The foundation is where it starts from. So when the foundation\u2019s in trouble, the whole building\u2019s in trouble.\u201d</p>",

Officials have cited divine protection for Burundi\u2019s ostensibly low infection rate and urged citizens to go about their daily lives without fear.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.iwacu-burundi.org/covid-19-le-burundi-est-une-exception-car-cest-un-pays-qui-a-donne-a-dieu-la-premiere-place/\">Nkurunziza\u2019s spokesperson recently said </a>that though the country may be hit by the pandemic, \u201cBurundi \u2026 has signed a special covenant with God, whether you believe it or not\u201d.<br><br>Evariste Ndayishimiye, the CNDD-FDD\u2019s candidate, said people should not be afraid because \u201cGod loves Burundi\u201d, adding that if there were people who had tested positive, it was \u201cso that God may manifest his power in Burundi\u201d.</p> <p>Six other candidates are running, including the opposition leader Agathon Rwasa, who is deputy chairman of the national assembly. Rwasa has been able to open offices and hold large rallies around the country in what has been an unexpectedly competitive campaign.</p> <p>Nelleke van de Walle of the International Crisis Group, a research organisation, said: \u201cYou do see certain elements of a real election \u2026 but political space is really limited. There is almost no local or international media left. This is definitely not an election where people can express their opinions freely.\u201d</p> <p>Both Ndayishimiye and Rwasa were senior commanders in predominantly Hutu militias during a civil war in which about 300,000 people were killed. Nkurunziza came to power in 2005 as part of a peace deal.</p> <p>Ndayishimiye has promised to \u201cfight poverty and develop the country\u201d, claiming his party had taken 15 years to \u201clay the foundations\u201d for the future, and it was not the time to put \u201camateurs\u201d in power.</p> <p>Voters who spoke to journalists in Burundi last week were too fearful to give their names. A 45-year-old vegetable seller in the capital, Bujumbura, supported the ruling party because it had provided welfare.</p> <p>\u201cThey give us rice and beans and can build houses for the most vulnerable among us like elders or widows,\u201d she said.</p> <p>But a jobless 32-year-old supported the opposition. \u201cAll of us need change, many Burundians need \u2026 one to end this daily violence, these killings, this rampant corruption and economic embezzlement,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Medics and others have braved official threats to raise concerns that the true number of Covid-19 cases is much higher than the official count.</p> <p>A health ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said seven patients had gone to one hospital with symptoms such as respiratory distress and that a whole wing had been dedicated to them ata military hospital.</p> <p>A doctor, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, reported six deaths of patients \u201cpresenting all the symptoms of coronavirus\u201d last week.</p> <p>Six staff responsible for taking samples at the National Institute of Public Health, the only place in Burundi that was carrying out tests, have become ill with the virus.</p> <p>\u201cSince then all activity is paralysed, no test can be carried out, it is a catastrophe,\u201d an employee of the institute said.</p> <p>The country\u2019s last election in 2015 led to violence that left at least 1,200 dead, displaced hundreds of thousands and resulted in a sustained crackdown on the opposition and media. Aid was cut off by donors and sanctions imposed.</p> <p>Last year the government shut down the UN human rights office after repeated criticism that members of the CNDD-FDD\u2019s youth wing and the security services were torturing, gang-raping and murdering political opponents. Rights groups say those attacks have increased in the run-up to Wednesday\u2019s presidential, legislative and municipal elections.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Nkurunziza will remain president until August, and a new constitution has given him sweeping powers to declare a state of emergency if the results are disputed.</p> <p>\u201cA perfect storm is brewing in Burundi, but after years of repression, few are left to bear witness and sound the alarm,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/about/people/lewis-mudge\">Lewis Mudge</a>, Central Africa director at Human Rights Watch.</p> <p>Burundi is one the poorest country in the world, <a href=\"https://www.gfmag.com/global-data/economic-data/the-poorest-countries-in-the-world\">by some measures.</a></p> <p>\u201cThe economic record of Nkurunziza\u2019s 15 years in power is catastrophic. He has taken Burundi backward on all levels, he has completely isolated the country from its traditional donors and even neighbouring countries. It is a calamity,\u201d said Aime Magera, an exiled spokesman for the main opposition National Freedom Council.</p> <p><br><br></p> <p><br><br></p> <p><br><br></p> <p><br></p> <p><br></p>",
  "<h2><strong>What is the World Health Assembly?</strong></h2> <p>The World Health Assembly is the key decision-making body of the World Health Organization, attended by representatives of the United Nation\u2019s 194 member states.</p> <p>The two-day 2020 assembly will be held virtually \u2013 it usually happens in Geneva \u2013 because of the ongoing Covid-19 crisis around the world.</p> <p>This year\u2019s assembly, the 73rd WHA, will be dedicated almost entirely to strengthening global coordination against the Covid-19 pandemic, which has infected more than 4.7 million people and killed 315,000.</p> <p>This will be a critical assembly: the annual meeting comes at a time when the WHO has attracted unprecedented global attention for its coordination and advisory role during the pandemic.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/16/australia-making-its-presence-felt-at-who-while-backing-calls-for-major-reform\">Australia making its presence felt at WHO while backing calls for major reform</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Influential states, most notably the US, have criticised the WHO for being slow to react, and alleged it has been biased towards China. The US has withheld funding from the WHO in response to its perceived Covid-19 failings.</p> <h2><strong>What is the proposal for an inquiry into the origins of Covid-19, and which countries are behind it?</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://apps.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA73/A73_CONF1Rev1-en.pdf\">A key conference paper</a>, already filed ahead of the assembly, and supported by 122 countries, including the members of the European Union and the African Group, the UK, Russia, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, calls for a systemic review of the world\u2019s response to Covid-19.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Initiate, at the earliest appropriate moment, and in consultation with member states, a stepwise process of impartial, independent and comprehensive evaluation ... to review experience gained and lessons learned from the WHO-coordinated international health response to Covid-19.</p> </blockquote> <p>The draft motion does not mention China or Wuhan (the city where the virus was first detected) by name. But it urges the global health community to:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>... identify the zoonotic source of the virus and the route of introduction to the human population, including the possible role of intermediate hosts, including through efforts such as scientific and collaborative field missions.</p> </blockquote> <p>And the paper argues the response to the pandemic must be global. The motion:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\u2026 calls for the universal, timely and equitable access to and fair distribution of all quality, safe, efficacious and affordable essential health technologies and products including their components and precursors required in the response to the Covid-19 pandemic as a global priority.</p> </blockquote> <h2><strong>And China\u2019s position?</strong></h2> <p>Calls for an independent international investigation into the origins of Covid-19 have been viewed by Beijing as an attempt to blame it for the disease emerging and breaking out globally. When Australia first proposed a global inquiry last month, China said it was \u201cseriously concerned about and firmly opposed to this\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cSince the outbreak began, China has always acted in an open, transparent and responsible manner and taken a series of resolute, timely and forceful measures,\u201d foreign ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang then said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/let-taiwan-help-the-who-fight-covid-19\">Let Taiwan help the WHO fight Covid-19 | Letter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Australia led the charge publicly with calls for an inquiry that has now gathered the support of 62 countries, but it has come at the expense of further strain in Australia-China relations. Beijing has proposed massive tariffs on Australian barley and blocked some Australia meat imports, moves condemned by Canberra as attempts at economic coercion.</p> <p>But with growing international support for an inquiry, China\u2019s language has softened considerably. The foreign ministry argued the European Union-drafted motion to be dealt with at the World Health Assembly should be viewed in a different light from Australia\u2019s initial proposal.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/guardian-australia-morning-mail/2014/jun/24/-sp-guardian-australias-morning-mail-subscribe-by-email\">Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"email signup\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4148\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Guardian Australia's Morning Mail\" data-form-description=\"Get our editors' pick of the biggest headlines every weekday\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not the same thing,\u201d a foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian, said at a regular press briefing last week. \u201cYou should not view them together from a political angle.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Will Taiwan be a key issue?</strong></h2> <p>The presence of Taiwan at the meeting is likely to prove a divisive issue, and there is significant risk that valuable time \u2013 the meeting is strictly limited to two days \u2013 could be lost in the machinations of whether representatives of the Taipei government will be allowed in the meeting.</p> <p>Taiwan\u2019s administration was the first government in the world to deploy preventative measures to guard against the spread of Sars-Cov2 virus, and the island has been held up as global success story: it had only 440 cases and seven deaths, despite being just 180km from the Chinese mainland, where the pandemic began.</p> <p>Diplomatic allies of Taiwan, including Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Paraguay, have formally requested to invite Taiwan to the meeting as an observer. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has also said publicly he wants Taiwan in the room.</p> <p>Besides the input from Taiwan as a country that has successfully combated Covid-19, the US push for its inclusion is part of a broader struggle between Washington and Beijing for influence within the WHO.</p> <p>Member states will vote on Taiwan\u2019s admittance to the assembly. A unanimous affirmation is required, and it appears increasingly like China will block Taiwan\u2019s admittance.</p> <p>Since the election of the pro-independence president, Tsai Ing-wen, in 2016, China has routinely vetoed Taiwan\u2019s inclusion into UN bodies. Taiwan participated in the WHA as an observer from 2009 to 2016, when the Beijing-friendly president, Ma Ying-jeou, was in office, but has not been invited since.</p> <h2><strong>What are the other issues up for debate?</strong></h2> <p>This will be an intensely political WHA \u2013 a meeting that often passes with little public commentary \u2013 because of the continuing Covid-19 crisis around the world, and the varying capabilities of government responses.</p> <p>The role of the World Health Organisation itself, and its response to the pandemic, will also be under extreme scrutiny, following accusations from the US, Australia and Germany, among others, that it was slow to respond to the initial outbreak and has displayed a bias towards China.</p> <p>The WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has weathered much of the criticism, in particular from the US president, Donald Trump, who said the organisation was \u201cvery China-centric\u201d and had given the US a \u201cfaulty recommendation\u201d about keeping its borders open.</p> <p>The WHO has been criticised for its response to pandemics before.</p> <p>In 2009, it declared the H1N1 flu outbreak as a pandemic, a decision later criticised by some governments that argued it triggered countries to take expensive measures against a disease that was ultimately milder than forecast.</p> <p>The agency and its then director general, Margaret Chan, also faced sharp criticism for not reacting fast enough to the deadly Ebola outbreak in West Africa that began in December 2013.</p> <p>The 2020 WHA will also address a global vaccine action plan, neglected tropical diseases, and polio eradication.</p> <p><em>with Reuters</em></p>"
