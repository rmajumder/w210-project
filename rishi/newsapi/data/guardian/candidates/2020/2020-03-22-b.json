The country\u2019s real face of the coronavirus crisis, however, is Christian Drosten, the head of virology at Berlin\u2019s Charit\u00e9 hospital.</p> <p>As one of the scientists who discovered the infectious agents responsible for the Sars epidemic, Drosten has immaculate credentials. The curly haired 48-year-old also has a natural talent as a communicator that have led the S\u00fcddeutsche Zeitungmade to describe him as \u201cthe nation\u2019s corona-explainer-in-chief\u201d.</p> <p>A daily half-hour podcast in which Drosten fields questions about the virus has attracted millions of listeners since he started it with the broadcaster NDR in mid-February. On social media, there have been joking calls for him to run for chancellor and riotous fan fiction: \u201cTouch my face, Christian Drosten.\u201d</p> <p>Drosten made his Sars research public via the internet before it was published in scientific journal, and he has favoured similar levels of transparency during the current crisis.</p> <p>He has been more pessimistic in his assessment of the risks than other virologists, suggesting up to 70% of the German population could catch the coronavirus. He has, however, also been more relaxed about what he sees as appropriate social responses, given the current level of spread in Germany.</p> <p>Last weekend he recommended Germans go for a walk and enjoy a good beer \u2013 although bottled beer was safer than draught, because the glass may not have been washed properly. <strong>Philip Oltermann</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b3bedf12e9372e379610a3c0768631257697f1d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3bedf12e9372e379610a3c0768631257697f1d5/0_0_2000_1330/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Head of the Center for Coordination of Health Alerts and Emergencies (CCAES) Fernando Simon holding a press conference at the Moncloa Palace in Madrid, Spain, 18 March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fernando Sim\u00f3n, the head of Spain\u2019s health emergency centre, gives a press conference in Madrid on 18 March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jm Cuadrado Jimenez Handout/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Spain</h2> <p>For the second time in Spain\u2019s recent history, all eyes are on Fernando Sim\u00f3n. The lanky, unassuming epidemiologist stepped into the spotlight in 2014, after<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/06/nurse-spain-tests-positive-ebola\"> a nurse in Spain contracted Ebola</a> when a priest was repatriated to Madrid from Sierra Leone.</p> <p>The infection, the first outside Africa, put 15 people in quarantine and led to the monitoring of dozens more. As health officials scrambled to quell the spread of the deadly disease, Sim\u00f3n, who heads the country\u2019s health emergency centre, conveyed calm.</p> <p>As Covid-19 began its advance around the world in February, Sim\u00f3n stepped up again. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine the satisfaction that rippled through the press room when he entered,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.lavanguardia.com/vida/20200307/473989540682/fernando-simon-centro-emergencias-sanitarias-coronavirus.html\">said a journalist with La Vanguardia</a> who praised his clear, concise explanations.</p> <p>Sim\u00f3n has since spoken to Spaniards nearly every day. As Spain became the hardest-hit country in Europe after Italy, he has come to embody the toll the crisis is taking. Exhaustion lines on his face have deepened, his wavy hair has become ever more unruly and his rasping voice has almost given out.</p> <p>Spanish authorities have faced criticism for being<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/spain-city-streets-turn-quiet-coronavirus-lockdown-madrid-barcelona\"> slow to react</a>, allowing tens of thousands to gather for International Women\u2019s Day rallies and pack into a Madrid football stadium a week before the country went into near-total lockdown, and there have been calls for Sim\u00f3n to resign.</p> <p>\u201cThe country is in intensive care and the doctor treating it has committed too many errors,\u201d one researcher <a href=\"https://twitter.com/oriolmitja/status/1239584312430862341\">wrote on Twitter</a>.

A senior figure in the government\u2019s research agency, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), he was applauded after he corrected the president about how quickly a coronavirus vaccine could be made available.</p> <p>Fauci, who has reported to six presidents, told Politico earlier this month: \u201cYou should never destroy your own credibility. And you don\u2019t want to go to war with a president ... But you got to walk the fine balance of making sure you continue to tell the truth.\u201d</p> <p>The Brooklyn-born doctor has been at the NIH since 1968, turning down repeated requests to lead the agency. In 1984, he was made head of its National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), which researches infectious diseases such as HIV/Aids, tuberculosis and Ebola.</p> <p>Some of Fauci\u2019s most influential work contributed to the understanding of how HIV destroys the body\u2019s defences. In a 2019 analysis of Google Scholar citations, he was the 41st most highly cited researcher of all time.</p> <p>At 79, he is among those most vulnerable to developing severe coronavirus symptoms but is reportedly working 19-hour days.

His father, who was shot dead in Athens when Whitty was a teenager in an apparent case of mistaken identity, worked for the British Council. Witty still speaks warmly of Nigeria, colleagues said.</p> <p>His time in Nigeria may have shaped a passion for global health.

A year later, he was appointed chief scientific adviser to the Department for International Development (DFID).</p> <p>Whitty works hard.

Their geography is different, the population is different, the rate of spread of the virus is different. Their exposure to international flights at the outset of the virus - completely different.

The National Protocol does not direct jurisdictions to do such assessments but instead, leave it to the State\u2019s discretion.</p> \n   <p>Contrary to some public statements made, every cruise liner that has entered NSW ports has been the subject of an assessment well beyond Federal requirements.</p> \n   <p>The National Protocol states \u201cprovided there are no concerns about the COVID-19 risk profile of a ship or suspected COVID-19 cases reported, the human bio-security officer may advise the bio-security officer that pratique can be granted and the ship may be allowed to continue the voyage while samples are being tested\u201d.</p> \n   <p>NSW Health undertook a full assessment of the Ruby Princess, notwithstanding under the National Protocol in place, it could have chosen not to do an assessment.</p> \n   <p>NSW Health again followed the National Protocol that states \u201cthe ship may be allowed to continue the voyage while samples are being tested\u201d.</p> \n   <p>However, as of midnight March 22, NSW Health will go even further beyond the National Protocol and its current own State protocols and will hold all cruise ships in port until any patients highlighted as having respiratory issues are tested for COVID-19.</p> \n   <p>The increased testing regime follows 26 confirmed cases of COVID-19 from the Ruby Princess, including 17 passengers and 1 crew member diagnosed in NSW, and 8 passengers diagnosed interstate (as of 8 pm yesterday).</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-22T08:03:05.716Z\">at 8.03am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7717978f08e0999e6b7e97\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-22T07:49:13.922Z\">7.49am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Carlton and United Breweries, the company <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/dec/07/cub-55-workers-have-won-all-demands-in-industrial-dispute-says-union\">whose mistreatment of 55 workers</a> prompted national outrage in 2016, says it is <strong>concerned about brewery jobs</strong> after the Victorian government announced its shutdown of non-essential industries. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/rwillingham/status/1241628263107051520\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Carlton and United Breweries are worried about brewery jobs and beer supplies. \u2066<a href=\"https://twitter.com/abcmelbourne?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@abcmelbourne</a>\u2069 <a href=\"https://t.co/69gJxiWQvb\">pic.twitter.com/69gJxiWQvb</a></p>\u2014 Richard Willingham (@rwillingham) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rwillingham/status/1241628263107051520?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 22, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7710948f08a08573fbf303\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-22T07:30:28.308Z\">7.30am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">ACT says schools will be 'pupil free' from Tuesday</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Just back to the ACT momentarily, the government has also announced it <strong>will be shifting rapidly to online learning in schools</strong>.

The SA police commissioner will also declare a major emergency in that state \u2014 that replaces the public health emergency that was previously declared, and means that emergency provisions are authorised under the Emergency Management Act and not the Public Health Act. </p> \n  <p>Police are responsible for enforcing that act, so the emergency management response will now be coordinated by the police commissioner. This is similar to what Tasmania announced on Thursday.</p> \n  <p>Marshall said the measure was announced after<strong> a number of cases in SA in recent days were of people who had contracted the virus after returning from interstate, or contracted it from people visiting from interstate.</strong></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This has forced our decision to close our borders in South Australia. We make this decision in the interest of public health in South Australia. <strong>People that are coming into South Australia, whether they are visitors or whether they are South Australians returning, will be required to undertake 14 days of self isolation.</strong> This is no longer something which is optional. It is mandatory. It is the social responsibility of every single person in this state to make sure that they are abiding by these rules. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The laws will come into force on 4pm on Tuesday. Border control stations will be set up at the airport, at train stations, and on roads entering SA \u2014 repurposing heavy vehicle inspections stations and biosecurity stations that already exist on the border.</p> \n  <p>Marshall said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>When people come into South Australia, from four o\u2019clock onTuesday afternoon, they will be required to understand precisely the orders that will be in place. <strong>They will be asked to sign a declaration that they will self isolate and they will be required to provide SA Police with information on where they will be undertaking their self isolation</strong>. There will be tests on this important declaration and this commitment individuals regarding this very, very important Public safety initiative. </p> \n   <p>There will be some arrangements put in place along borders because we know that in country South Australia, sometimes two towns on either side of the border have a high level of interaction ... People that do live in those communities will be allowed to move between those communities once they have been identified as somebody in on of those communities but, I stress, if there is any reason to believe that there is an outbreak on the immediate other side of the border, then that\u2019ll have to also be curtailed.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Marshall said there would be some \u201clogical exceptions\u201d to the quarantine requirements, particularly around freight.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-22T03:38:01.470Z\">at 3.38am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e76d8078f08a08573fbf24c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-22T03:17:00.864Z\">3.17am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">NSW premier says she will introduce a 'more comprehensive' lockdown of non-essential services</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here is the full statement from the NSW premier, <strong>Gladys Berejiklian</strong>, on a \u201cmore comprehensive lockdown of non-essential services\u201d in NSW.<br></p> \n  <p>The statement reads:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p><em>Tonight I will be informing the National Cabinet that NSW will proceed to a <strong>more comprehensive shutdown of non-essential services.

One was aspiring to be statesmanlike, reassuring an anguished public and mobilizing the awesome power of the American government. The other was more familiar: belligerent, anti-science, racially divisive, airing grievances and resentments and blaming everyone but himself.</p> \n<p>Yet from the blur something else was coming into focus. Having procrastinated at the outbreak of the pandemic, this was the week Trump regained his footing and began to thread a narrative <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/30/brad-parscale-trump-campaign-manager\">aimed at his re-election.</a></p> \n<p>The bid for four more years of power includes muscular language, projecting himself as a wartime leader, a dose of nationalism in stricter border controls and references to the \u201cChinese virus\u201d, and a blitzkrieg at his old foes in the media.</p> \n<p>Although he can no longer hold rambunctious campaign rallies, Trump is instead relishing the medium he knows best by holding televised daily briefings from the White House. Whereas for a while he was forced to play second fiddle to the Democratic presidential primary, now rival Joe Biden is forced to host virtual campaign events \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/us/politics/joe-biden-digital-campaign.html\">plagued by technical glitches</a> - and Trump is back at the centre of events.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/17/steve-bannon-working-class-republicans-labour\">Steve Bannon,</a> a former White House chief strategist, said: \u201cWe are at war, and now by necessity he is a \u2018wartime\u2019 president. Churchill rose to the occasion and secured his place in history. Trump\u2019s moment is here, to grasp or to lose.\u201d</p> \n<p>So far there is little sign that even this trauma, which is shutting down much of the country, has shifted America\u2019s political divide.</p> \n<p>Democrats have eviscerated the president for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/coronavirus-outbreak-response-trump-us\">downplaying the threat of the virus</a> \u2013 Despite Trump\u2019s vague and overoptimistic claims, America is still woefully lacking in testing kits and equipment , and its notoriously flawed healthcare system could soon be overwhelmed.</p> \n<p>However, as in so many other political flashpoints over the past three years, Republicans remain loyal to Trump, and there is no evidence that his \u201cbase\u201d is deserting him. <a href=\"https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/abc-news-coronavirus-poll\">An ABC News/Ipsos poll </a>released on Friday found that 55% of respondents approve of the president\u2019s management of the coronavirus crisis, while 43% disapprove. This represented a switch from a week earlier when only 43% approved and 54% disapproved.</p> \n<p>The finding may reflect a discernible change in Trump\u2019s attitude, starting on Friday 13 March when he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/donald-trump-coronavirus-national-emergency\">declared a national emergency.</a> He then expanded travel restrictions on Europe, Canada and Mexico, issued guidelines against group gatherings of more than 10 people, signaled his support for sending cheques to affected Americans and invoked the Defense Production Act to mass produce equipment.</p> \n<p>There was also a change in tone, as he tried to sound more sombre and serious \u2013 with mixed success \u2013 and alluded to the fight against Hitler. \u201cEvery generation of Americans has been called to make shared sacrifices for the good of the nation,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-5/\">he said on Wednesday,</a> citing the teenage volunteers, factory workers and shipbuilders of the second world war.</p> \n<p>\u201cAnd now it\u2019s our time. We must sacrifice together because we are all in this together and we\u2019ll come through together. It\u2019s the invisible enemy.\u201d</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/henryolsenEPPC?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Henry Olsen,</a> a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center thinktank in Washington, said: \u201cIt\u2019s the sort of thing that will resonate with his supporters: strength, decisiveness and, let\u2019s not forget, this came from a communist country.\u201d</p> \n<p>At first the concept of a microscopic \u201cinvisible enemy\u201d did not fit the old Trump playbook that prefers to target people, often people of color. But in the past week he found a fix with some characteristic branding, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/trump-calls-covid-19-the-chinese-virus-as-rift-with-coronavirus-beijing-escalates\">\u201cChinese virus\u201d,</a> to constantly remind the public where the respiratory infection originated. On Thursday Trump even crossed out the word \u201ccorona\u201d in his prepared remarks and hand wrote \u201cChinese\u201d instead.</p> \n<p>There was criticism of the term as a xenophobic ploy to fire up his \u201cbuild the wall\u201d support base. </p> \n<p>Olsen said he would have awarded Trump a grade D two weeks ago but the president is now quickly waking up to reality. \u201cThis would be a test of any president and things can change as people rally round. We\u2019ve got a test of the thesis of the anti-Trump and <a href=\"https://lincolnproject.us/\">Never Trump crowd:</a> they always told us when a true crisis came, he wouldn\u2019t be able to handle it. Events will speak for themselves.\u201d</p> \n<p>If the number of deaths soars and the economy craters, Olsen noted, Trump is likely to lose in November. But if the opposite happens, \u201che\u2019ll be able to say he was up to the test. In a sense, we\u2019re at the roulette table and everything is on black and we don\u2019t know where it\u2019s going to land.\u201d</p> \n<p>The virus has scrambled Washington\u2019s political order. The election has temporarily become a sideshow as Congress rushes through billions of dollars in stimulus to stave off a 1930s-style great depression. Senate Republicans, typically the party of small government, low taxes and rugged individualism, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/us/politics/mitt-romney-coronavirus-checks.html\">proposed a direct payment</a> to Americans of up to $1,200.</p> \n<p>Trump earned praise from Andrew Cuomo and Gavin Newsom, the Democratic governors of New York and California states respectively. Yet the president could not <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/donald-trump-coronavirus-politics-andrew-cuomo-gretchen-whitmer\">resist tweeting attacks</a> at Cuomo and Gretchen Whitmer, the Democratic governor of Michigan. He played little part in negotiating with the Democratic-led House of Representatives, which impeached him a few months ago, dispatching the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, instead.</p> \n<p>In the daily White House briefings the old Trump was never far away, with misleading claims, attempts to blame his predecessor and unhinged outbursts that probably had the career health professionals at his side inwardly cringing. On Friday a reporter asked the president for his message to Americans who are feeling scared. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/20/trump-coronavirus-question-attack-reporter-over-fears\">The reply was less than Churchillian:</a> \u201cI say that you\u2019re a terrible reporter. That\u2019s what I say. I think it\u2019s a very nasty question and I think it\u2019s a very bad signal that you\u2019re putting out to the American people.\u201d</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.panettainstitute.org/about-us/institute-people/leon-panetta/\">Leon Panetta,</a> a former defense secretary and director of the CIA, said: \u201cHe\u2019s still wrapped up in the political traps that he constantly gets bound by as to the press and the Democrats and whoever else is out there who he tweets about. He\u2019s still caught in that paralysis that prevents him, frankly, from really exercising the leadership that the country needs.\u201d</p> \n<p>Regarding Trump\u2019s use of the phrase \u201cChinese virus\u201d, Panetta added: \u201cI have to believe that he continues to use that term as a way to appeal to his base as opposed to trying to exercise what I think would be more responsible leadership in acknowledging that what we\u2019re now dealing with, whether he likes it or not, is the American virus.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump has generally found bad publicity to be more useful than no publicity at all. The crisis has handed him a dominant national platform where Vice-President Mike Pence and other officials lavish him with praise. Biden, meanwhile, marked his latest victories in the Democratic primary race in <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?470455-1/joe-biden-primary-night-remarks\">a streamed video</a> from his home in Wilmington, Delaware, speaking for six minutes in front of a black curtain with no audience.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://watson.brown.edu/people/faculty-fellows/schiller\">Wendy Schiller,</a> a political science professor at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, said: \u201cIt\u2019s perfectly conceivable Trump survives this and wins the election. If he can keep the death toll down, sell the idea that it could have been worse and show he was a volatile character who turned the corner in a crisis, it\u2019s going to be hard for Biden to unseat him.</p> \n<p>\u201cShowing minimal compassion in the case of Donald Trump may be all he has to do to win in 2020.\u201d</p> \n<p>Should the coronavirus kill thousands and wreak economic destruction, however, voters may well turn to Barack Obama\u2019s vice-president for steadiness and wisdom. Schiller said: \u201cBiden is the epitome of the opposite of Trump in a crisis. If people are going to turn away from Trump, Biden is exactly the person they will go for.\u201d</p> \n<p>Panetta, who has endorsed Biden for president, believes this latter scenario will come to pass. He said: \u201cHistory is not going to be kind with the fact that they knew about this pandemic going back a number of months and did very little to prepare the country to deal with it.\u201d</p>",

Written before the first nominating contest and the global pandemic, it is a mixture of enthusiasm and partially outdated realism.</p> <p>Plouffe is no longer dismissive of Trump and his political skill set. As for Clinton\u2019s loss, Plouffe observes, the \u201ckillers\u201d were the \u201cdiscrepancies\u201d on the margins, in the swing states, and Clinton\u2019s own errors.</p> <p>\u201cThree strikes, and you know what happened next,\u201d writes Obama\u2019s counselor. Plouffe contends that a significant pool of \u201cundecided and persuadable and might-vote citizens\u201d will probably control the next election\u2019s outcome.</p> <p>Citizen\u2019s Guide offers a useful description of the \u201cgettable\u201d electorate: first-time voters, Obama/Trump voters, past-Trump voters who are \u201copen to an alternative\u201d and voters who did not previously vote for him but who are now open to that possibility. Likewise, Plouffe is mindful of political identification serving as social glue and identity.</p> <p>As he frames things: \u201cIf November comes and persuadable voters testify\u201d that Trump drives them \u201ccrazy with tweets\u201d, view him as a \u201cterrible person\u201d, but conclude that the president has been \u201cOK on the economy and the Democrats want to turn us into a socialist country\u201d, Trump will probably return to power.</p> <p>To be sure, the economy is no longer fine: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MorabitoCM/status/1240097382886453249\">Black Plague 2.0</a> is never a good look. First-time jobless claims <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/19/weekly-jobless-claims.html\">have s</a><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/19/weekly-jobless-claims.html\">oared</a>, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-17/morgan-stanley-economists-say-global-recession-now-base-case\">major investment houses</a> have proclaimed a global recession. Reality is stripping Trump\u2019s theatrics bare.</p> <p>Yet Trump was never simply a candidate. He led a movement. How all this affects his support is an open question. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWFgqnisSsk\">Breaking up is hard to do</a>.</p> <p>Understandably, Plouffe takes heart from the midterms which saw the Democrats recapture the House of Representatives. That was about Democrats building on their traditional base of liberal voters, minorities and graduate degree holders, making inroads with suburbanites and white women and ginning up those who go to the polls less frequently.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/mi/michigan_trump_vs_biden-6761.html\">Michigan</a> and <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/pa/pennsylvania_trump_vs_biden-6861.html\">Pennsylvania</a>, which went for Trump, are again leaning Democratic. <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/az/arizona_trump_vs_biden-6807.html\">Arizona</a>, which last voted blue in 1996, may be fertile territory for Biden. If these three states were to flip on election day and everywhere else remained frozen in time, the president would be out of a job. When Tulsi Gabbard drops out of the race, it\u2019s a sign that the public hungers for political comfort food.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1c76697fc2a745c1112981e32445de86ac831969\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1c76697fc2a745c1112981e32445de86ac831969/0_0_2621_1573/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Biden speaks about Covid-19, known as the coronavirus, in Wilmington, Delaware.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Biden speaks about Covid-19, known as the coronavirus, in Wilmington, Delaware.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Saul Loeb/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>From the looks of the recent primaries, 2018 may be a limited harbinger of what comes next.

On the other hand, participation in Illinois dropped markedly.</p> <p>Looking ahead, voting by mail may emerge as the rule, not the exception. Disease and social distancing are altering how we live and vote. Our country and democracy are in transition.</p> <p>Plouffe has publicly acknowledged Biden\u2019s vulnerability with younger voters. On that score, his concerns are to a point well-placed.</p> <p>Biden won less than 40% of <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/elections/2020/primary-results/voter-analysis?state=IL\">Illinois Democrats</a> under the age of 45 even as he took nearly three-in-five older voters. Michigan told a similar story. But Sanders was no pied piper. Although he won younger voters, the Vermont senator did not electrify them. In all fairness, elections are an older person\u2019s game.</p> <p>Plouffe offers no foolproof method for energizing young Americans. The environment is a major concern for this bloc, but issues don\u2019t axiomatically translate into votes. Just a hunch: survival in the face of a plague may take priority.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/16/dark-towers-review-deutsche-bank-donald-trump\">Dark Towers review: Deutsche Bank, Donald Trump and a must-read mystery</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Unfortunately, Plouffe can come close to broad-brushing Trump supporters as irredeemably deplorable.

Demonstrative competence and compassion stand to go a long way in troubled times. Biden\u2019s speeches on coronavirus and last Tuesday were presidential.

Edgar Allan Poe\u2019s mid-19th-century short story, <a href=\"https://www.poemuseum.org/the-masque-of-the-red-death\">Masque of the Red Death</a>, is no longer mere fiction. Live campaign events and door-knocking are relics of a simpler time. Don\u2019t expect to see a Trump rally anytime soon. His daily briefings are a tragic substitute.

Sydney\u2019s famous Bondi Beach, from Australian Associated Press.</p> \n  <p>The New South Wales government has temporarily closed Bondi Beach as authorities handed lifesavers unprecedented move-on powers amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p> \n  <p>NSW Police David Elliott announced the drastic measure on Saturday afternoon after photos of throngs of beachgoers flocking to the iconic Sydney strip drew swift condemnation.</p> \n  <p>Thousands flocked to Bondi Beach on Friday amid temperatures in the high 30s, ignoring social distancing measures.</p> \n  <p>Pictures of big crowds were criticised by foreign media and on social media.</p> \n  <p>The decision comes as the number of coronavirus cases in NSW ballooned to 436 after 83 new cases were identified in the state.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a significant level of disappointment that we have to move today to not only remove people from Bondi Beach and it\u2019s a significant opportunity to remind people that the Health Act must be complied with,\u201d Mr Elliott said.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cWhat we saw this morning at Bondi Beach was the most irresponsible behaviour of individuals that we\u2019ve seen so far.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe cannot have an area where more than 500 people are gathered.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Under regulations introduced to control the spread of the deadly virus, outdoor gatherings of 500 people or more have been banned.</p> \n  <p>As part of that, lifesavers will have the power to close beaches and ask people to move on if a crowd of 500 or more is gathered at the same spot.</p> \n  <p>The minister said that if the crowd does not comply, NSW Police will have the powers to make people leave.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThis is not something we\u2019re doing because we\u2019re the fun police, this is not something that the government is doing because we want to make life easy, this is about saving lives,\u201d Mr Elliott said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cTomorrow in NSW we will probably crack 500 cases of coronavirus.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIf the community does not comply with the regulations and the health warnings, this is going to become the new norm.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe are going to close down the type of activities we\u2019ve grown to love.\u201d</p> \n  <p>It came as Waverley mayor Paula Masselos on Saturday issued a public plea for people to stay away from Bondi amid the coronavirus pandemic and away from beaches.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cThe public must at all times keep a minimum safe distance from each other in public places and if you don\u2019t need to be out in public, please consider staying at home,\u201d Mr Masselos said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe all have a role to play in preventing the spread of COVID-19 and I am frustrated that people continue to ignore health advice about social distancing as observed yesterday at Bondi Beach.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt also hit out at people who flouted social distancing advice and risked spreading the virus.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cWhat happened in Bondi was unacceptable and the local council must take steps to stop that occurring,\u201d Mr Hunt said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cEach of us as individuals, as families, as groups, as councils, as state governments, as a national government has responsibility.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWhere something like this is occurring the local council must step in and that message is

second-highest number of daily positive diagnoses this week</strong>, following 152 identified on Wednesday, according to the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC).<br><br>The pace of daily new infections had shown signs of slowing since the second week of this month after health authorities finished testing 210,000 followers of a secretive church that was at the centre of the country\u2019s outbreak.<br><br>Just over 100 of the new daily cases were from Daegu, the southeastern city where the church is located, and nearby North Gyeongsang province. The two locations account for about 60% of all of South Korea\u2019s Covid-19 infections. <br><br>There is concern, however, over a rise in infections in Seoul and among people arriving from overseas, Yonhap news agency said.<br><br>Seoul reported 15 additional cases and nearby Gyeonggi Province 12, while the number among people arriving in the country rose by six to 23.<br><br>In response, South Korea will require all arrivals from European countries to get tested for the virus and self-isolate for two weeks starting Sunday, Yonhap said, adding that temporary shelters had been set up to accommodate up to 1,000 European travelers while they wait for their test results.<br><br>South Korean health authorities have won praise for their mass testing regime, which has enabled them to quickly identify infection clusters. The number of people being checked for the virus and under quarantine came to 15,704 as of Friday, the KCDC said. The country has tested a total of 327,509 suspected cases, with 303,006 coming back negative.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-21T04:09:15.056Z\">at 4.09am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e758eb78f08dcc95cc2076e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-21T03:58:45.534Z\">3.58am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>People living in poorer areas of the Philippine capital, Manila, have begun building makeshift barricades to halt movement along the tight alleyways of their neighbourhoods, as this image, taken by Ezra Acayan for Getty Images shows.</p> \n  <p>The Philippine island of Luzon, which includes Manila, has been on lockdown since Monday.
