Iata\u2019s director general, Alexandre de Juniac, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The industry\u2019s outlook grows darker by the day.

Allowing them an exemption would weaken any debt-relief initiative. Providing aid through the World Bank and other donors while allowing commercial debt payments to absorb a large share of the transfer would be the financial equivalent of pouring water into a bucket with large holes. To put the figures in context, commercial debt repayments would be equivalent to over half of the emergency Covid-19 financing being prepared by the World Bank for delivery through IDA.</p> \n   <p>... Official creditors should make it clear that they expect commercial creditors to apply comparable treatment. There are precedents which, if not directly applicable, could serve as a guide. These include the \u2018Vienna Initiative\u2019 through which European governments coordinated the response to the 2009 financial crisis. If necessary, governments should encourage participation by making access to special Covid-19 financing programmes conditional on commercial creditors participating in the debt standstill. Faced with a global public health emergency that demands a global financial response, governments must deploy their regulatory powers and financial resources in the interest. The G20 should work with the IMF and World Bank to convene a commercial creditors summit to agree terms for creditor participation in debt repayment suspension.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/14/commercial-creditors-must-sign-up-to-global-debt-deal-or-forgo-covid-19-help\">Commercial creditors 'must sign up to global debt deal' - or forgo Covid-19 help</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-14T16:57:16.441Z\">at 5.57pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e95e3c18f082a2cd32a6aa3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-14T16:38:41.425Z\">5.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The coronavirus lockdown in <strong>Uganda</strong> has been extended for another three weeks, with the president, Yoweri Museveni, calling on people to be disciplined to avoid spreading infection. </p> \n  <p>In a lengthy address to the nation on Tuesday, Museveni reaffirmed Uganda\u2019s 35 restrictions to curb the spread of the coronavirus, adding that judging by the comparatively low number of infections in the country - 54 confirmed cases as of Monday - they seemed to have worked.

The strictest measures implemented so far have been gatherings of more than 50 people and a ban on visits to nursing homes.</p> \n  <p>But its soft approach has drawn criticism. On Tuesday Sweden\u2019s public health agency said it had recorded a total of 11,445 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 1,033 deaths. Neighbouring Finland, which has about half the population of Sweden, had as of Tuesday reported 64 deaths, and has closed down restaurants and schools.</p> \n  <p>In an open letter, a group of 22 doctors, virologists and researchers from Sweden\u2019s top hospitals, universities and research institutes pointed write:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>One would like to imagine that Sweden has also had a forward-looking strategy, especially as our country has always had a different way of dealing with the spread of infection than the rest of the world. One would like to imagine that our authorities have prepared well since the epidemic broke out in China, and especially since it was clear that the problem was likely to be global.</p> \n   <p>\u2026 If there was a well-thought-out, well-functioning strategy for Swedish infection prevention work with Covid-19, Sweden would hardly have the same death toll as Italy today, and 10 times higher than Finland\u2019s. If there had been a well-developed, well-functioning strategy, half of Stockholm\u2019s elderly residents would not have been affected by the epidemic - and in some cases over 20% of the healthcare staff would be antibody positive.</p> \n   <p>\u2026 The approach must be changed radically and quickly. As the disease-free virus spreads, it is necessary to increase social distance. Close schools and restaurants in the same way you do in Finland. Everyone who works with the elderly must wear adequate protective equipment. Prior to mass testing of infectiousness on all caring staff and testing for antibodies to sars-covid-2 so that established immune personnel can return to work.

He appealed to Germans to continue following the hygiene regulations as well as keeping their distance, saying these remained the two most crucial ways to dampen the virus\u2019 spread.</p> \n  <p>He added that in Germany the average age of those infected was 49, and a cough, temperature, blocked nose and loss of taste and smell remained the most commonly reported symptoms. In 2% of cases people developed pneumonia he said, while 16% of cases ended up in hospital.</p> \n  <p>On Monday, the Academy of Sciences, Leopoldina released a long-awaited study in which it recommended a staggered return to normal life starting with schools reopening.

system</h2> \n  <p>In the third week of March, while most of our minds were fixed on surging coronavirus death rates and the apocalyptic scenes in hospital wards, global financial markets came as close to a collapse as they have since September 2008. The price of shares in the world\u2019s major corporations plunged. The value of the dollar surged against every currency in the world, squeezing debtors everywhere from Indonesia to Mexico. Trillion-dollar markets for government debt, the basic foundation of the financial system, lurched up and down in terror-stricken cycles.</p> \n  <p>On the terminal screens, interest rates danced. Traders hunched over improvised home workstations \u2013 known in the new slang of March 2020 as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-18/global-traders-creating-the-ultimate-work-from-home-rona-rigs\">Rona rigs</a>\u201d \u2013 screaming with frustration as sluggish home wifi systems dragged behind the movement of the markets. At the low point on 23 March, $26tn had been <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2020/03/22/goodbye-dow-30000-hello-dow-10000/#559a9620ff50\">wiped off</a> the value of global equity markets, inflicting huge losses both on the fortunate few who own shares, and on the collective pools of savings held by pension and insurance funds.</p> \n  <p>What the markets were reacting to was an unthinkable turn of events. After a fatal period of hesitation, governments around the world were ordering comprehensive lockdowns to contain a lethal pandemic. Built for growth, the global economic machine was being brought to a screeching halt. In 2020, for the first time since the second world war, production around the world will contract. </p> \n  <p>It is now clear that we can, if circumstances demand, turn the economy off. But the consequences are catastrophic. </p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/14/how-coronavirus-almost-brought-down-the-global-financial-system\">How coronavirus almost brought down the global financial system</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e95475c8f08db3109f21f15\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/helen-davidson\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-14T05:18:50.139Z\">6.18am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <h2>Global Covid-19 cases near 2 million as Putin warns Russia faces \u2018extraordinary\u2019 crisis</h2> \n  <p>The number of Covid-19 cases recorded worldwide is nearing 2 million, as Vladimir Putin warned warned officials to brace for \u201ccomplex and extraordinary\u201d scenarios in Russia as a result of the outbreak.</p> \n  <p>The country reported 2,558 new cases on Monday, its highest daily figure yet, as officials tightened lockdown restrictions in Moscow.

Last Man on Earth is possibly the most relevant sitcom for these times. </strong>Will Forte plays Phil Miller, a man who believes he is the sole survivor of a pandemic that has wiped out the world\u2019s population. Running for four seasons, before being cancelled on a cliffhanger, Van Badham writes that this is no reason to not try out a comedy <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/apr/15/the-last-man-on-earth-a-tender-and-powerfully-life-affirming-post-apocalyptic-sitcom\">whose quirky tone earned it a cult following</a>. \u201cThe conceptual triumph of Forte\u2019s show is that the tragedy of the event is enhanced, rather than trivialised, by the comedy taking place in its aftermath. Its survivor characters may be clowns who trip over the imperfect humanity of themselves and one another, but The Last Man on Earth treats the dead with solemnity, and against this, the haplessness of living people who consistently struggle to manage the heroic is tender and powerfully life-affirming.\u201d </p> <p><strong>Australia\u2019s physical distancing measures have had great success at reducing the rate of Covid-19 infection. </strong>The estimated effective reproduction number is below 1, meaning each person infected is believed to pass the coronavirus on to less than one other person on average \u2013 an important milestone to decrease the number of active cases.

  "<p>In the end, it wasn\u2019t even close.</p> <p>Less than a week after<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/07/wisconsin-votes-controversial-election-coronavirus-us-election-2020\"> forcing Wisconsin voters to risk their health</a> and go to the polls, Wisconsin Republicans suffered a stunning defeat on Monday night.</p> <p>Daniel Kelly, a conservative justice on the state supreme court, lost his seat to Jill Karofsky, a liberal challenger, <a href=\"https://projects.jsonline.com/topics/election/2020/4/13/wisconsin-spring-election-results-april-7.html\">by more than 163,000 votes</a>. Such a wide margin is remarkable in Wisconsin, where a race for a different state supreme court seat was decided last year by just 6,000 votes.</p> <p>The election served as an early litmus test of Donald Trump\u2019s political strength in Wisconsin, a state he critically needs to win in November. And it was the most significant test so far of whether a state could hold a fair election in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic. Republicans in the state refused a last-minute request to delay the election. That decision was widely seen as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/10/wisconsin-voter-restrictions-democracy-coronavirus-primary\">cold political calculation</a> \u2013 fewer people would turn out to vote in person, which would benefit Kelly.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/13/us-elections-2020-joe-biden-wisconsin\">Biden wins in Wisconsin as a liberal supreme court challenger stages upset</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ultimately, that calculation was wrong. Turnout was just<a href=\"https://elections.wi.gov/node/6853\"> over 34%</a>, the highest for a spring election in the state since 2016, when both parties had competitive presidential primaries. It was only the second time in over half a century that a challenger defeated an incumbent for a seat on the state supreme court, <a href=\"https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2020/04/13/wisconsin-supreme-court-election-results-daniel-kelly-vs-jill-karofsky-conservative-liberal/2986880001/\">according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel</a>. Karofsky\u2019s victory means the conservative majority on the supreme court will narrow from 5-2 to 4-3.</p> <h2>\u2018Isolation might have fostered higher voter turnout\u2019</h2> <p>The election offers a strong rebuff to Trump, who insisted that Democrats wanted to postpone the election and move to an entirely vote-by-mail contest to boost their political chances. Trump has also repeatedly, and falsely, claimed that mail-in balloting leads to widespread voter fraud \u2013 there is <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/issues/ensure-every-american-can-vote/vote-suppression/myth-voter-fraud\">no evidence</a> of that in Wisconsin or elsewhere \u2013 and that it only benefits Democrats.</p> <p>It\u2019s more likely that Democratic turnout benefited from the party\u2019s presidential primary being on the ballot. And at a time when Americans are spending more time consuming news at home, the controversy over whether to hold the election may have actually wound up encouraging voters, said Barry Burden, director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.</p> <p>\u201cIronically, isolation at home might have fostered higher voter turnout,\u201d he said. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c2a5a6606e226c3c60551688f146c62ec72a753f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2a5a6606e226c3c60551688f146c62ec72a753f/0_0_3900_2340/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Voters make their choices in Milwaukee last week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Voters make their choices in Milwaukee last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike De Sisti/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the election still came at a high price and probably disenfranchised many voters. People <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/4/7/21211879/wisconsin-voters-lines-election-primary\">waited hours</a> in line in Milwaukee, Green Bay and Waukesha to vote on election day, even as the state was under a formal stay-at-home order. State health officials are tracking whether holding in-person voting <a href=\"https://www.wisn.com/article/wisconsin-health-officials-wait-to-see-if-primary-election-leads-to-more-coronavirus-cases/32133309#\">led to more cases of Covid-19</a>.</p> <h2>\u2018It raises serious concerns for the future of our democracy\u2019</h2> <p>\u201cAlthough we were successful in this race, the circumstances under which this election was conducted were simply unacceptable, and raise serious concerns for the future of our democracy,\u201d Karofsky said in a statement on Monday evening. \u201cToo many were unable to have their voices heard because they didn\u2019t feel safe leaving their home or their absentee ballots weren\u2019t counted.\u201d</p> <p>In an interview on Tuesday, Karofsky said she was still hearing from voters who were unable to vote because they never received an absentee ballot or did not feel comfortable going to the polls. Even though she won, she said she still believed the election should have been moved.</p> <p>\u201cTheir voices matter no matter what the result was yesterday,\u201d she said of disenfranchised voters. \u201cI do not think it can ever happen again. We can never have the type of voter suppression that we had last week, which resulted in people having to make an impossible choice between voting and staying healthy or alive.\u201d</p> <p>Karofsky added she thought last-minute Republican maneuvering around the election only reinforced the anti-corruption message her campaign pushed. \u201cWhen it happens that quickly, it\u2019s really easy for people to see what\u2019s going on,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Charles Stewart, a political science professor at MIT who studies elections, said that voter turnout in Milwaukee county was between 35,000 and 50,000 votes short of what it \u201cshould\u201d have been compared with other counties.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s clear that turnout would have been greater in towns like Milwaukee and Green Bay had in-person election day voting not collapsed,\u201d he said. \u201cI think this race showed the value of the belt-and-suspenders approach of making mail voting available for everyone who wants it, but still maintaining as much of an in-person program as possible.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/10/wisconsin-primary-coronavirus-republican-voting-by-mail\">Wisconsin proves it: Republicans will sacrifice voters' health to keep power</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is a nationwide push to prepare for a mail-in election in November, and the Wisconsin contest offered a case study of the challenges. State officials got an unprecedented 1.2 million people to request mail-in ballots through early and consistent public messaging. But the flood of requests overwhelmed local clerks, who were unable to issue ballots promptly. Reports of people who requested ballots but never received them were being investigated by the Wisconsin elections commission and US Postal Service.</p> <h2>\u2018Voter suppression might not be as clever as Republicans think it is\u2019</h2> <p>Wisconsin\u2019s election highlighted the way last-minute court rulings and changes can bring havoc. Days before election, a federal judge extended the deadline to receive absentee ballots, but on the eve of the election, the US supreme court stepped in and added a requirement that ballots be postmarked by election day. That ruling caused enormous confusion after ballots started arriving at election offices without postmarks, disenfranchising voters who had put their ballots in the mail close to election day. It\u2019s still not clear how many viable ballots were thrown out.</p> <p>The contest also illustrated how severely Covid-19 can curtail in-person voting. In Milwaukee, city election officials faced such a shortage of poll workers that they closed down all in-person voting and offered just five locations to vote on election day, compared with the usual 180. Turnout in the city dropped 20 points from 2016.</p> <p>\u201cIt is indisputable that thousands upon thousands of voters were disenfranchised,\u201d said Ben Wikler, chair of the Wisconsin Democratic party. \u201cVoter suppression might not be as clever as Republicans think it is. It can backfire by pissing voters off.\u201d</p>",

Singling out Sanders, Obama said the Vermont senator was an \u201cAmerican original\u201d who would be critical to defeating Trump in November.</p> \n<p>When Sanders exited the race, Trump tried to sow discord by questioning why Obama had not yet endorsed Biden.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt does amaze me that President Obama hasn\u2019t supported Sleepy Joe,\u201d the president said during a coronavirus briefing, speculating that his predecessor \u201cknows something that you don\u2019t know, that I think I know, that you don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> \n<p>In a statement on Tuesday, the Trump campaign suggested Obama was somehow reluctant to support his former vice-president, with whom he shared an uncommon friendship and whom he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/12/barack-obama-joe-biden-presidential-medal-of-freedom\">awarded</a> the presidential medal of freedom in 2017.</p> \n<p>\u201cObama has no other choice but to support him,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/30/brad-parscale-trump-social-media-rasputin-campaign-manager\">Brad Parscale</a>, Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign manager. \u201cEven Bernie Sanders beat him to it.\u201d</p> \n<p>In 2008, Obama assembled a coalition of African Americans, suburban women, white working-class voters and, crucially, young people in what many Democrats remember as one of the most inspirational campaigns in modern history.</p> \n<p>Biden has drawn support from similar constituencies but is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/15/joe-biden-supporters-millennials-youth-vote\">missing a key part of that coalition</a>: young people, who remain deeply skeptical of his candidacy.</p> \n<p>To the dismay of some Democrats, Obama has mostly continued the tradition of former presidents by not criticizing his successor, even as Trump has dismantled his legacy on everything from healthcare to climate change. In the midst of a pandemic, Trump has sought to deflect criticism by blaming his predecessor.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday Obama did not mention his successor by name, instead assailing the party Trump leads and implicitly criticizing him with praise of Biden.</p> \n<p>\u201cOne thing everybody has learned by now is that the Republicans occupying the White House and running the US Senate are not interested in progress,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThey\u2019re interested in power.\u201d</p> \n<p>\ufeffBiden\u2019s association with Obama helped propel him ahead of younger rivals. His eight years as Obama\u2019s No 2 contributed greatly to his support among African American voters, particularly in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/south-carolina\">South Carolina</a>, the foundation of a remarkable <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/03/joe-biden-super-tuesday-victory-democratic-primary\">campaign turnaround</a>.</p> \n<p>His time as vice-president was also central to his argument that he is a capable, experienced leader best positioned to beat Trump in November.</p> \n<p>Obama made a similar case in his endorsement video, citing Biden\u2019s leadership during the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/feb/03/who-caused-financial-crisis-great-recession\">Great Recession</a>, as well as his management of the H1N1 and Ebola crises.</p> \n<p>Healthcare proved to be a flashpoint during the primary, with candidates divided between expanding the Affordable Care Act, Obama\u2019s signature achievement, or seeking universal health coverage.</p> \n<p>Biden has resisted Sanders\u2019 Medicare for All plan and advocated for building on the ACA, nicknamed Obamacare.</p> \n<p>In his video, Obama said it was time to \u201cgo further\u201d and ensure that all Americans have access to healthcare, calling on Democrats to push for a public option, expand Medicare and \u201cfinish the job so that healthcare isn\u2019t just a right, but a reality for everybody\u201d.</p> \n<p> Biden, who has pledged to choose a woman for his vice-president, told donors on a fundraising call that Obama advised him to choose someone who is not afraid to disagree with him and who will \u201calways tell me the truth\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe most important thing \u2013 and I\u2019ve actually talked to Barack about this \u2013 the most important thing is that there has to be someone who, the day after they\u2019re picked, is prepared to be president of the United States of America if something happened,\u201d Biden said at the virtual fundraiser.</p>",
  "<p>At first the conversation was: why is no one talking about Tara Reade\u2019s accusations of sexual assault against Joe Biden? Then somehow it changed to: did you hear about the Twitter war between Rose McGowan and Alyssa Milano about Tara Reade\u2019s accusations of sexual assault against Joe Biden? Somehow we skipped over the part where we actually talked about Tara Reade\u2019s accusations of sexual assault against Joe Biden.</p> <p>So did you? Did you hear? About what Rose McGowan said about Alyssa Milano to her face? I mean to her Twitter account, which is basically the same thing? She called her a fraud! And they used to work together!

And now that we are in a moment of believing women and treating such accusations seriously and with the dignity and due process they deserve, it surprised her that both avenues of investigating her claims against the presumptive nominee of the Democratic party, the media and the justice system, seemed closed to her. Reporters would not return her calls, politicians would not return her calls and Time\u2019s Up, the organization that claims to assist women looking for legal representation to manage claims of sexual misconduct at work, said they <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/03/24/joe-biden-metoo-times-up/\">could not help her out</a> without legally risking its not-for-profit status.</p> <p>This weekend the New York Times released an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/us/politics/joe-biden-tara-reade-sexual-assault-complaint.html\">investigation</a> into Reade\u2019s claims, which found support for some of what she\u2019s said \u2013 she says she was punished for her complaint against Biden by being removed from her duties supervising interns, and interns who worked with Reade confirm she suddenly disappeared - but also found a lot of people willing to disavow her account. What remains is the usual he-said-she-said murk, which allows people to use the same story to confirm wildly different beliefs. If you think Biden is a creep, the small bits of support to Reade\u2019s harassment and assault claim will confirm that. If you think Biden is above reproach, you\u2019ll find the lack of eyewitness testimony proof he is a good man. So we all get to have public opinions about a terrible thing - whether that is an assault or a false accusation of assault \u2013 and sometimes use those opinions to get attention or further our careers. If you\u2019re a celebrity, anyway; if you\u2019re someone like Tara Reade the best you can usually hope for is to be largely ignored.</p> <p>But being ignored has to be better than this: being \u201chelped\u201d and her visibility expanded by some decade-long feud between a couple of rich celebrities. Both McGowan and Milano claim to be advocates for survivors of sexual violence, using their connections and their media visibility and their social media followers to draw attention to cases like the trial against the supreme court justice Brett Kavanaugh or \u2026 I don\u2019t know, they tweeted about Harvey Weinstein or whatever.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Neither one of them seemed to be able to do much to help Reade or Biden get the due process Milano now so wholeheartedly believes in</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Neither one of them seemed to be able to do much to help Reade or Biden get <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2019/04/02/actress-metoo-activist-alyssa-milano-defends-joe-biden/\">the due process</a> Milano now so wholeheartedly believes in. In all of her support of and consultation work for the organization Time\u2019s Up, she couldn\u2019t seem to intervene to help Reade get the kind of pro bono advice that <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/stevenperlberg/former-obama-adviser-anita-dunn-helped-harvey-weinstein\">Weinstein enjoyed from Anita Dunn</a>, a communications guru who <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/07/us/politics/joe-biden-anita-dunn.html\">now works for </a><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/07/us/politics/joe-biden-anita-dunn.html\">Biden as a consultant</a>. Milano claims she very strongly wants the accusations to be vetted and for justice to be done, so surely she\u2019ll get on the phone and help sort out whatever complications are preventing this organization \u2013 you know, the one that has raised more than $20m for its legal defense fund \u2013 from helping to settle this matter once and for all.</p> <p>Both actors are <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2018/01/alyssa-milano-times-up-metoo-and-harvey-weinstein-rolling-stone.html\">taken seriously</a> by the media as advocates and spokespeople for survivors, even though <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/year-ago-alyssa-milano-started-conversation-about-metoo-these-women-n920246\">Milano \u201cstarted\u201d the #MeToo movement</a> with a tweet that failed to give credit for the phrase to its rightful originator, actual activist and social organizer Tarana Burke. Alyssa Milano \u2013 who became famous on television when it was decided that at 12 years old she was good at saying things like \u201cDad!\u201d or \u201cWhat?\u201d and then holding a cutesy pose while a live studio audience followed its instructions to applaud or laugh \u2013 cannot in any seriousness be called an \u201corganizer\u201d. And McGowan, whose Twitter bio is literally \u201cI am here to help society be better\u201d, can\u2019t seem to stop herself from trying to make all the bad things that happen to women <a href=\"https://variety.com/2018/scene/vpage/rose-mcgowan-meltdown-barnes-and-noble-book-signing-1202684004/\">ultimately about her</a>.</p> <p>It used to be that celebrities highlighted good charitable causes worthy of attention and money by using the fame they already possessed to gesture toward the people doing the real work. Think of Elizabeth Taylor\u2019s work with Aids charities long before the red ribbons became fashion statements. Think of Princess Diana standing out in a field full of landmines. Now we have has-beens and never-wases trying to claw back any lost fame or fortune or public attention by standing in front of survivors of real hardship with a bullhorn, screaming \u201cDon\u2019t you know who I am\u201d and trying to take credit for anything good that might follow.</p> <p>This is what happens when the attention economy takes over matters of real importance. When the squabbles of the rich and privileged suck up all of the air, it\u2019s hard to have anyone hear you when you try to talk about how maybe it\u2019s bad that Time\u2019s Up and Biden\u2019s campaign share the consulting firm SKDKnickerbocker and maybe that has something to do with Reade\u2019s inability to retain affordable counsel. Or how the rich in this country are the only ones with easy access to justice. Or how an election between one old guy with a credible sexual assault accusation against another old guy with <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/culture/2020/2/19/21144280/e-jean-carroll-elle-fired-trump-defamation-lawsuit\">a credible rape accusation</a> against him isn\u2019t the sense of hope we were looking for.</p> <p>But no, instead let\u2019s talk about how this McGowan-Milano thing really goes back to on-set tensions back when they were working on that show together.

  "<p>Poland\u2019s parliament will this week discuss a controversial proposal to tighten abortion laws in the country, as opposition politicians and women\u2019s rights groups warn that the country\u2019s conservative government may use the distraction of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus</a> pandemic to push through the legislation.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/poland\">Poland</a> already has some of the strictest legislation in Europe on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/abortion\">abortion</a>, and previous attempts to tighten the laws further were abandoned after mass protests in 2016. The proposal comes from a citizen initiative, and it is unclear if the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party will support it, but president Andrzej Duda, a PiS ally, has said he would sign the law if it reaches his desk.</p> <p>\u201cFor them, this is the best time to pay the debts they have to ultra-conservative groups,\u201d said Barbara Nowacka, an opposition MP who was active in the protests four years ago. \u201cWe are really afraid that they will use the fact that citizens of Poland are really focused on their future and health right now, and not on values, sexual education, women rights.\u201d</p> <p>On Tuesday, dozens of women protested in central Warsaw, in cars and on bicycles, honking horns and displaying posters against the law. Police used megaphones to warn protesters they risked fines for breaking lockdown regulations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3dbea90a1d544d5cc87b9437bdc582cc506194f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3dbea90a1d544d5cc87b9437bdc582cc506194f5/0_348_5626_3376/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman rides her bicycle during a protest of Polish women\u2019s rights activists in Warsaw.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman rides her bicycle in Warsaw during a protest by Polish women\u2019s rights activists.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wojtek Radwa\u0144ski/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Polish proposal comes amid global concerns over access to abortion during the coronavirus pandemic. Last week, Amnesty International called on governments across Europe to ease \u201conerous administrative requirements to access abortion services\u201d, which it said was making safe access difficult.</p> <p>Earlier this month, Marie Stopes International <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/03/coronavirus-crisis-may-deny-95-million-women-access-to-family-planning\">estimated</a> that there could be as many as 3 million additional unintended pregnancies and 2.7 million unsafe abortions in the 37 countries in which it works, as well as 11,000 pregnancy-related deaths.</p> <p>In Poland, abortion is already illegal except in cases of rape, incest, severe foetal abnormalities or in cases where the mother\u2019s life is at risk. In 2016, a citizen\u2019s bill aimed to outlaw even these types of abortion, leading <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/05/polish-government-performs-u-turn-on-total-abortion-ban\">to huge protests in towns and cities across the country</a>. The government backed away from its support.</p> <p>The bill was re-submitted in a less severe form in 2018, seeking to outlaw abortions in the case of foetal abnormalities. It has since been stalled in parliament but is now due for mandatory review, with discussions expected on Wednesday and Thursday. Some have suggested that this is merely a formality, and they are not expecting the government to push the law through quickly. Others, however, fear the difficulty of protest during the coronavirus pandemic could provide the perfect cover.</p> <p>There have been protests online, and with people hanging flags in their windows. \u201cBut this doesn\u2019t have the same impact as a massive protest on the streets,\u201d said Nowacka.</p> <p>In an interview with a Catholic news outlet earlier this month, president Duda said \u201ckilling disabled children is simply murder\u201d and promised he would sign the law if it reached him. Duda is up for re-election next month, a vote the government is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/polish-government-still-planning-to-hold-presidential-election\">controversially insisting will go ahead</a>, despite the restrictions in place due to the pandemic. PiS has courted a conservative, Catholic voter base with rightwing rhetoric against abortion rights, LGBT rights and so-called \u201cgender ideology\u201d.</p> <p>Natalia Broniarczyk, of the Abortion Dream Team organisation, said that even without the new legislation, the coronavirus pandemic has made life harder for women seeking abortion. The organisation\u2019s helpline has received around 550 calls in the month since lockdown was imposed in Poland, which is twice as much as during a usual month.</p> <p>Many Polish women with pregnancies in the first trimester are able to get around the current legislation by ordering pills online for medical abortion at home. Some women were concerned at whether the postal service would still function to deliver pills, while others were considering abortions due to the unexpected difficult economic situation.</p> <p>\u201cMany people lost their job from one day to the next and they don\u2019t have money even to live. For them, an unwanted pregnancy is the worst scenario,\u201d Broniarczyk said. Some Polish women <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/10/pro-choice-activists-launch-abortion-initiative-in-poland\">travel abroad for abortions</a>, something which has also become extremely difficult due to recently imposed travel restrictions.</p> <p>Rights groups have warned the Polish government not to support the new legislation. \u201cThe chaos and anxiety surrounding Covid-19 shouldn\u2019t be used as a distraction from harmful attempts to push through dangerous legislation,\u201d said Hillary Margolis, senior women\u2019s rights researcher at Human Rights Watch.</p>",

By Monday, America\u2019s greatest living immunologist said that was a poor choice of words, and he bristled when reporters suggested he wasn\u2019t rolling back his words voluntarily. \u201cEverything I do is voluntary,\u201d he snapped. \u201cPlease.

He was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/13/joe-biden-2006-video-abortion\">anti-abortion</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/17/joe-biden-role-iraq-war\">pro-Iraq </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/17/joe-biden-role-iraq-war\">war</a> and <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2019/11/biden-bankruptcy-president/\">in the pocket</a> of big banks. Even today, Biden says he has \u201c<a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/joe-biden-says-millennials-dont-have-it-tough-780348\">no empathy</a>\u201d for young people who complain about indebtedness and precarity. He has told millennials who raise concerns about his environmental policies that they should \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3dqR9oQ9pE\">go vote for someone else</a>\u201d. Plenty have been willing to do just that. So while some commentators, such as Vox\u2019s Matthew Yglesias, have <a href=\"https://youtu.be/TmHFt13osiQ\">suggested</a> that activists and left media are responsible for Biden\u2019s \u201cunity problem\u201d, the more blameworthy culprit is Biden himself.</p> <p>In fact, it doesn\u2019t seem as if Biden has much interest in solving his \u201cunity problem\u201d. In an ostensible effort to reach out to the left, Biden recently <a href=\"https://www.democracynow.org/2020/4/10/headlines/joe_biden_calls_for_medicare_eligibility_age_to_be_lowered_from_65_to_60\">debuted new policies</a> on healthcare and education. Did he adopt the policies recommended in the activists\u2019 letter, namely Medicare for All and canceling all outstanding student debt? <a href=\"https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/joe-biden-outlines-new-steps-to-ease-economic-burden-on-working-people-e3e121037322\">No, he did not</a>. Instead, he merely proposed lowering the existing Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 60 and canceling tuition-related debt for students who attended public colleges who earn under a certain income.</p> <p>The first of these policies almost seems like a deliberate insult. Biden\u2019s response to those young people demanding a better health policy is to offer a policy that won\u2019t help any of them for decades. And to understand just how pitifully stingy this \u201cconcession\u201d is, remember that dozens of Democratic senators, including plenty of \u201cmoderates\u201d, have <a href=\"https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article211824324.html\">already</a> endorsed lowering the Medicare eligibility age to 55. You can find an op-ed in Forbes (not exactly the Democratic Socialists of America newsletter) <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/teresaghilarducci/2020/04/10/now-more-than-ever-is-time-to-lower-medicares-age-to-50/#6d26b0ee52be\">suggesting</a> 50 would be a better age. Bill Clinton <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/07/us/clinton-proposes-opening-medicare-to-those-55-to-65.html\">proposed 55</a> in 1998, and Hillary Clinton <a href=\"https://www.advisory.com/daily-briefing/2016/07/12/clinton-health-care-plan\">advocated 55</a> in 2016. So Biden\u2019s big concession to the left is actually more conservative than a centrist Democratic proposal! It\u2019s not nothing, but it\u2019s about as close to nothing as a policy can get without literally being nothing, and it shows that Biden isn\u2019t serious about courting the left.</p> <p>Remember, too, that we\u2019re only talking about the <em>platform. </em>This is where negotiations <em>start. </em>By the time a proposal has gone through the political process, it inevitably gets watered down. Maybe, if we\u2019re lucky, we\u2019ll get the Medicare age dropped from 65 to 63 by the year 2030 or something. And even that prospect assumes that Biden is serious about fighting for his platform. At election time, politicians have an unfortunate habit of promising voters whatever they think voters want to hear. Needless to say, they don\u2019t always follow through, and you\u2019re often better off looking at their record than their rhetoric. From Biden\u2019s record, it\u2019s more plausible that he\u2019ll follow through on his <a href=\"https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/03/09/all-you-need-know-biden-reportedly-weighing-billionaires-michael-bloomberg-and-jamie\">reported plan</a> to put Michael Bloomberg and JPMorgan\u2019s CEO, Jamie Dimon, in his cabinet than that he\u2019ll overhaul the healthcare system.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Many progressives are going to have a difficult time voting for Biden</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The student debt plan is a disappointment, too. Why only public colleges, when so much unsustainable debt comes from private universities? Why only tuition-related expenses? Why is it means-tested? If Biden wants to impress the left, he will need a big, sweeping plan, not a plan with dozens of qualifiers and caveats that recalls Kamala Harris\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/kamala-harris-student-debt-proposal-confused-people-2019-7\">infamous proposal</a> to forgive debt only for \u201cPell grant recipients who start a business that operates for three years in disadvantaged communities\u201d.</p> <p>I actually really hope Biden embraces one of the big left policy proposals such as Medicare for All or the Green New Deal, because he can\u2019t afford to write off progressive votes, and the stakes of this election are high. If Donald Trump is re-elected, it will be a disaster: he will be emboldened and more powerful, and will end his second term with almost complete control of the courts. Democracy as we know it may disappear altogether; US militarism will escalate; carbon emissions will spiral out of control; and brutal new immigration policies will be introduced. Trump needs to lose, but Biden is <a href=\"https://www.currentaffairs.org/2020/01/a-biden-nomination-means-a-second-trump-term\">already a weak candidate</a>, and he will be even weaker if he can\u2019t turn out the progressive base.</p> <p>Many progressives are going to have a difficult time voting for Biden. He has shown contempt for them and betrayed many of the causes they care about. To make matters worse, Tara Reade\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.currentaffairs.org/2020/04/evaluating-tara-reades-claims\">credible</a> sexual assault <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/us/politics/joe-biden-tara-reade-sexual-assault-complaint.html\">allegation</a> against Biden will make it difficult for those who consider themselves allies of women and supporters of #MeToo to vote for him in good conscience. Biden has a long way to go to convince the left he\u2019s worth supporting.</p> <p>So far, though, it seems as if Biden is mostly concerned with reassuring rich Democratic donors and party bigwigs that he will keep his promise that \u201c<a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2019/06/19/joe-biden-to-rich-donors-nothing-would-fundamentally-change-if-hes-elected/\">nothing would fundamentally change</a>\u201d. That could almost be Biden\u2019s campaign slogan at this point. But it doesn\u2019t seem like a winner. He will need to do better if he\u2019s going to stand a chance of beating Trump.</p> <ul> <li><p>Nathan Robinson is the founding editor of Current Affairs.

  "<p>\u2018Let\u2019s be clear,\u201d Hillary Clinton <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/1247194855245316101?s=20\">tweeted </a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/1247194855245316101?s=20\">this month</a>. \u201cTrump does not have the power to cancel or postpone the November election.\u201d That tweet did not come out of nowhere. Covid-19 has already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/17/us-elections-voters-coronavirus\">disrupted the Democratic primaries</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/article/2020-campaign-primary-calendar-coronavirus.html\">with 16 states postponing their primary elections</a> because of public health concerns. There has been some worried speculation in recent weeks that Donald Trump may exploit the coronavirus crisis to indefinitely delay the US presidential election.</p> <p>While you imagine Trump would love to unilaterally crown himself king of the US, he doesn\u2019t have the power to postpone an election, as Clinton noted. Since 1845, federal law has mandated that presidential elections be held on \u201cthe Tuesday next after the first Monday in the month of November\u201d. Only Congress can change that \u2013 and it would be an arduous process, even before you factor in the House of Representatives being controlled by Democrats. Even if Congress did postpone the election, there would still be an expiry date on Trump\u2019s term. The 20th amendment to the constitution dictates that if an election does not happen, or Trump refuses to step down, his presidency will automatically end on 20 January 2021. The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/3/19\">would then become acting president</a>.</p> <p>Trump does not have the power to cancel the election, but he does have the power to corrupt it. Indeed, there are already signs that the Republican party will do everything it can to ensure a low turnout in November \u2013 it is well established that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/13/voter-suppression-2020-democracy-america\">fewer people voting means a higher chance of </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/13/voter-suppression-2020-democracy-america\">th</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/13/voter-suppression-2020-democracy-america\">at party winning</a>. Most Republicans don\u2019t like admitting to their voter-suppression advantage, but Trump, who has a well-documented problem with keeping his mouth shut, recently said the quiet part out loud. Last month, he went on the Fox News programme Fox &amp; Friends to talk about the Democrats\u2019 attempts to push through measures that would make voting easier during the pandemic. \u201cThe things [Democrats were proposing] were crazy,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/30/trump-republican-party-voting-reform-coronavirus\">Trump exclaimed</a>. \u201cThey had \u2026 levels of voting that, if you\u2019d ever agreed to it, you\u2019d never have a Republican elected in this country again.\u201d</p> <p>Unless a miracle happens and the coronavirus disappears, only the implementation of measures such as voting by mail and expanding early voting can ensure a free and fair election in November. This may be why Trump and the Republicans are fighting such reforms tooth and nail.</p> <p>If you want a preview of the pandemonium that could characterise the general election, look at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/10/wisconsin-voter-restrictions-democracy-coronavirus-primary\">the entirely preventable chaos that </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/10/wisconsin-voter-restrictions-democracy-coronavirus-primary\">unfolded recently in Wisconsin\u2019s Democratic primary</a>. Last Monday, the US supreme court\u2019s conservative majority blocked a court order <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/07/liberals-recoil-at-supreme-court-decision-on-wisconsin-primary-171347\">that would have extended the window </a><a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/07/liberals-recoil-at-supreme-court-decision-on-wisconsin-primary-171347\">to return absentee ballots</a>. This forced people to go out to vote in person, which resulted in dangerously long lines at the five polling places that were open \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/wisconsin-set-vote-national-guard-called-out-many-polling-places-n1178206\">there should have been 180</a>. (Happily, a liberal judge, Jill Karofsky, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/13/us-elections-2020-joe-biden-wisconsin\">defeated the conservative incumbent</a> for a seat on the state\u2019s supreme court a week later, which could prove important in future voting rights cases in the swing state.)</p> <p>Republicans are not only trying to make voting harder, they are also trying to discredit postal votes. \u201cMail in ballots substantially increases the risk of crime and VOTER FRAUD!\u201d Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1249132374547464193?s=20\">tweeted on Saturday</a>. This is a lie: <a href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/2020/04/trumps-latest-voter-fraud-misinformation/\">voting fraud via mail ballots is rare</a>. Never mind that Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/08/trump-mail-in-voting-2020-election\">voted by mail in Florida\u2019s </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/08/trump-mail-in-voting-2020-election\">primary in March</a>. But that does not count, because inconvenient facts never count.</p> <p>Anyway, if undermining confidence in mail ballots does not work, there is also the option of underfunding the US Postal Service (USPS). The USPS is on the brink of financial collapse and the <a href=\"https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/04/13/trump-threatens-postal-service-amid-pandemic-saveusps-urges-bulk-stamp-purchases-and\">Trump administration is refus</a><a href=\"https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/04/13/trump-threatens-postal-service-amid-pandemic-saveusps-urges-bulk-stamp-purchases-and\">ing to bail it out</a>. It is hard to vote by mail if there is no public mail service, after all.</p> <p>Let\u2019s be clear: Trump can\u2019t cancel November\u2019s election, but that does not mean we should rest easy. The Republicans will weaponise coronavirus in whatever way they can. The US loves invading countries in order to \u201cinstall democracy\u201d.

Clearly he felt wounded by the weekend\u2019s big New York Times story, which portrayed a president fumbling through January and February without a pandemic plan, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/13/trump-coronavirus-meltdown-media-authority\">writes David Smith</a>:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>Donald Trump, starved of campaign rallies, Mar-a-Lago weekends and golf, and goaded by a bombshell newspaper report, couldn\u2019t take it any more.

All major rugby stakeholders will be consulted, as will experts from outside the game, to help bring in fresh ideas and perspective.</p> <p>\u201cWe believe that rugby is at a crossroads.

It is only by working together that we can succeed. It is often true that the biggest challenges create the biggest opportunities and it is no different for rugby. We must help each other through these tough times.</p> <p>\u201cWe need World Rugby, as our international federation, to be fit for purpose and seen as world leading. We need to define our purpose and mission and what kind of organisation we want in order to lead us into the future. Only then can we decide what the strategic objectives are.</p> <p>\u201cFor rugby to thrive we need it to grow into a global sport and move beyond its traditional territories. We need a coherent and meaningful global calendar that supports those at the top of the game and develops those aspiring to be there. We also need to make our sport more attractive to everyone who plays and watches as well as the broadcasters.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/apr/12/rugby-union-coronavirus-cash-uncertainty-players-future\">Covid-19 has turned players' lives upside down but rugby was already fragile | Will Hooley</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Beaumont, who is campaigning for women to be represented at every level of decision-making in the game, was behind World Rugby\u2019s plan for a nations championship that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/19/world-rugby-nations-championship-rugby-union\" title=\"\">foundered last year</a> because it failed to attract the support of all of the Six Nations.

  "<p>In the third week of March, while most of our minds were fixed on surging coronavirus death rates and the apocalyptic scenes in hospital wards, global financial markets came as close to a collapse as they have since September 2008. The price of shares in the world\u2019s major corporations plunged. The value of the dollar surged against every currency in the world, squeezing debtors everywhere from Indonesia to Mexico. Trillion-dollar markets for government debt, the basic foundation of the financial system, lurched up and down in terror-stricken cycles.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/may/04/coronavirus-global-financial-collapse-prevented-podcast\">How coronavirus almost brought down the global financial system \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On the terminal screens, interest rates danced. Traders hunched over improvised home workstations \u2013 known in the new slang of March 2020 as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-18/global-traders-creating-the-ultimate-work-from-home-rona-rigs\" title=\"\">Rona rigs</a>\u201d \u2013 screaming with frustration as sluggish home wifi systems dragged behind the movement of the markets. At the low point on 23 March, $26tn had been <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2020/03/22/goodbye-dow-30000-hello-dow-10000/#559a9620ff50\" title=\"\">wiped off</a> the value of global equity markets, inflicting huge losses both on the fortunate few who own shares, and on the collective pools of savings held by pension and insurance funds.</p> <p>What the markets were reacting to was an unthinkable turn of events. After a fatal period of hesitation, governments around the world were ordering comprehensive lockdowns to contain a lethal pandemic. Built for growth, the global economic machine was being brought to a screeching halt. In 2020, for the first time since the second world war, production around the world will contract. It is not only Europe and the US that have been shut down, but once-booming emerging market economies in Asia. Commodity exporters from Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa face collapsing markets.</p> <p>It is now clear that we can, if circumstances demand, turn the economy off. But the consequences are catastrophic. Across the world, hundreds of millions of people have been thrown out of work. From the street hawkers of Delhi to the personal trainers of LA, the service sector \u2013 by far the most important employer in the modern economy \u2013 has been poleaxed. Never before has the global economy suffered a shock of this scale all at once. In the US alone, at least 17 million people have lost their jobs in the last three weeks. A severe global recession is now inevitable.</p> <p>The crucial question is how much of the world economy will survive the lockdown, and this depends on the availability of credit. Business runs on credit. The bits of the economy that do continue to function \u2013 the warehouses, the mobile phone providers and internet firms \u2013 all need credit. Wage bills for those still working are financed through credit. Even greater is the need of those who are not working. If they can\u2019t get loans, bills will go unpaid, which spreads the pain. To survive the lockdown, millions of families and firms around the world are relying on grants and loans from the state. But tax revenues have collapsed, so states need credit, too. Across the world we are witnessing the largest surge in deficits and government debt since the second world war.</p> <p>But who do we borrow from? Banks, financial markets and money markets provide the financial fuel of the world economy. Normally, credit is sustained by the optimistic promise of growth. When that dissolves, you face a self-reinforcing cycle of collapsing confidence, contracting credit, unemployment and bankruptcy, which spreads a poison cloud of pessimism. Like an epidemic, if left uncontrolled, it will sweep all before it, destroying first the financially fragile and then much else besides. It is not for nothing that we speak of financial contagion.</p> <p>What began with the lockdown in Wuhan in January is more intense and more fast-moving than any recession we have seen before. In a matter of weeks we have been confronted with an economic outlook that is as grim as at any moment since the 1930s. But it could have been even worse. Imagine a situation in which, on top of the pain of the lockdown and the hellish scenes in hospital wards, we also face calls for austerity because the government cannot safely finance extra spending. Imagine that interest rates were surging, and the terms for credit cards, car loans and mortgages were suddenly getting stiffer. All of this may still happen. It is already happening to the weaker economies around the world. But for now at least, it has not happened in Europe and the US \u2013 even after the turbulence of March 2020, when the pandemic hit with full force.</p> <p>What Europe and the US have succeeded in doing is to flatten the curve of financial panic. They have maintained the all-important flow of credit. Without that, large parts of their economies would not be on life support \u2013 they would be stone dead. And our governments would be struggling with a financial crunch to boot. Maintaining the flow of credit has been the precondition for sustaining the lockdown. It is the precondition for a concerted public health response to the pandemic.</p> <p>During major crises, we are reminded of the fact that at the heart of the profit-driven, private financial economy is a public institution, the central bank. When financial markets are functioning normally, it remains in the background. But when they threaten to break down, it has the option of stepping forward to act as a lender of last resort. It can make loans, or it can buy assets from banks, funds or other businesses that are desperate for cash. Because it is the ultimate backer of the currency, its budget is unlimited. That means it can decide who sinks and who swims. We learned this in 2008. But 2020 has driven home the point as never before.</p> <p>The last six weeks have seen a bout of intervention without precedent. The results have been momentous. A giant public safety net has been stretched out across the financial system. We may never know what went on behind the closed doors of the US Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England during those critical moments in March. So far, only <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-09/some-ecb-officials-had-doubts-about-emergency-bond-purchases\" title=\"\">muffled sounds of argument</a> have reached the outside. But as the virus struck, the men and women in those three central banks held the economic survival of hundreds of millions of people and the fate of nations in their hands. This is the story of how global financial meltdown was averted by central banks taking decisions that, just a month earlier, they would have dismissed as utterly impossible.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>The financial markets scan the world for risk. Even the slightest disruption in the vast networks of finance, production and trade offers the opportunity for profit or the threat of loss. So the news on 23 January, that the outbreak of an unknown virus was serious enough for the Chinese authorities to impose a gigantic quarantine, hit the traders on their Bloomberg terminals hard. Bank economists struggled to get a grip on the dimensions of the problem. Would this be a minor disruption like Sars in 2003? Or were we facing the nightmare scenario of the Hollywood film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/30/what-can-we-learn-about-coronavirus-from-watching-contagion\" title=\"\">Contagion</a>?</p> <p>In late January, investors began to move more and more money out of things like commodities and shares in companies, and into the relative safety of government bonds. What comforted them was the idea that the virus was a problem contained in China. The day that illusion burst \u2013 the day that investors realised that Covid-19 was becoming a global pandemic \u2013 was Monday 24 February. Over the weekend the Italian government had announced that it was imposing a quarantine in parts of northern Italy. It was the first place in the west to do so.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9a900558f352fc351fe1067ee4b65cb30b726ecc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a900558f352fc351fe1067ee4b65cb30b726ecc/0_0_5312_3541/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Around the time Italy imposed a national lockdown in early March, investors worldwide began to panic.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Around the time Italy imposed a national lockdown in early March, investors worldwide began to panic.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alessandro Serran\u00f2/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ever since the financial crisis of 2008, Italy\u2019s economy had been stagnating. Both its banks and its public finances were in a precarious state. Italy\u2019s debt levels were high enough to cause bond markets to periodically panic. Now the country would become the frontline in the virus fight. The coronavirus would test the solidarity of the eurozone at its weakest link.</p> <p>At this point, not everyone was taking the threat seriously. The caseload in the US still looked tiny. Donald Trump dismissed the virus as a \u201cscare\u201d. But investors were now seriously worried. Over the week that began on 24 February, America\u2019s main stock market index, the S&amp;P 500, lost 10% of its value. The chair of the US Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, was concerned enough to signal that he would soon be bringing forward a cut in interest rates, in order to stimulate consumption and investment. It was a conventional reaction, but Covid-19 was no longer looking like a conventional threat.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>By early March, whatever complacency had prevailed was long gone. The death toll in northern Italy was rising into the hundreds and it was only a matter of time before the government in Rome would be forced to declare a nationwide lockdown.</p> <p>Investors around the world started to panic. In times of uncertainty, they want safe-haven assets. What makes a government bond a safe investment is not only the financial standing of the borrower, but the depth of the market in which lenders can sell them if they want to get their money back sooner. There is no deeper market than that for US Treasuries, as US government bonds are known. The greater the demand for safety, the lower the interest rate the US government generally has to pay to borrow. In the first week of March, those rates were at record lows.</p> <p>For the rest of the world economy, this run to safety was an alarming signal. One sector that knew it was heading for trouble was oil. When the global economy slows, so does the demand for energy. The oil industry of the 21st century consists, on the one hand, of large, state-controlled producers \u2013 above all the Opec group dominated by Saudi Arabia and Russia \u2013 and, on the other hand, of the US\u2019s upstart fracking industry. To match falling demand for oil, the Saudis wanted to cut overall production and thus prop up the price. For this they needed the agreement of the other big producers, but Russia refused to go along with them. As Moscow saw it, cutting production with a view to propping up prices was an invitation to American shale producers to fill the gap. If the politics of climate change meant that the future really would bring a transition away from fossil fuel, winning the end game involved seizing as much of the market as possible for as long as oil was being pumped. So Russia decided not to cut production, but to launch a price war. Not wanting to be outdone, over the weekend of 7-8 March, Saudi Arabia <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/saudi-arabia-oil-price-war-production-increase-aramco\" title=\"\">took up the challenge</a>. It announced that it would be maximising production and discounting its prices.</p> <p>On Monday 9 March, as markets opened, oil prices plummeted. The benchmark Brent crude fell 24% by the end of trading. By the end of the month its value had halved. From the point of view of the financial markets, the ferocity of the competition in the oil industry was a harbinger of things to come. Falling demand would force industry after industry to either slash prices or contract production. Either way, it was bad news for profits.</p> <p>When trading opened on Wall Street that morning, the situation was so dire that the circuit-breakers \u2013 automatic stops to trading that are triggered when prices fall by a certain amount \u2013 were soon activated. This was supposed to slow a wild selloff. But it sent a message of panic. As soon as trading resumed, everything sold.</p> <p>A rout like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/mar/09/markets-plunge-crash-financial-crisis-coronavirus-ftse-italy-oil-price-dow-business-live?page=with:block-5e663c6f8f085f0b8d944e59\" title=\"\">the one that began on 9 March</a> has a perverse logic. When fund managers face withdrawals from the people whose money they manage, they need cash and have to choose which assets to sell first. They might prefer to sell the riskiest investments, but those can be disposed of only for a large loss. So instead, they attempt to sell their most liquid and safe assets \u2013 government bonds. That means the prices of those bonds fall, dragging them into the maelstrom. This has the knock-on effect of unravelling a basic relationship on which many investors rely: typically, when shares go down, bonds go up, and vice versa. So to protect yourself against risk, you buy a portfolio made up of both. If everything works as it\u2019s supposed to, the swings should balance each other out. But in the panic that began on 9 March, this was no longer happening: rather than balancing out, the price of shares and bonds were collapsing together. The only thing that anyone wanted to hold was cash, and what they wanted most of all were dollars. The surging US dollar in turn spread the pressure worldwide to everyone who owed money in that currency.</p> <p>The Fed had desperately tried to halt the run. To signal its willingness to support the economy and ease the pressure on the world economy from the strong dollar, it had <a href=\"https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/emergency-rate-cuts-events-caused-past-fed-coronavirus-timeline-when-2020-3-1028964493#1-october-2008-lehman-falls1\" title=\"\">brought forward</a> an interest rate cut that had been expected for the middle of the month. But with the darkening horizon, lower interest rates did little to help. Who would borrow or invest under such circumstances? Confidence was broken. Just how badly would become clear over the following two weeks.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>It was a cruel twist of fate that Italy was the first European country struck by the virus. Italy has a sophisticated medical system; Lombardy, the region worst affected by the virus, is among the richest places in the world. The weakness lies in the country\u2019s public finances. To fight the crisis, Italy needed to be spending money on public health and to support the economy during the lockdown. But would the corset of the euro give it the leeway?</p> <p>The problem was that spending to meet the coronavirus crisis would raise Italy\u2019s public debts. The more indebted you are, the higher the price you pay to borrow. For a European government, that premium is measured by the difference, or \u201cspread\u201d, between your interest rate and that paid by Germany, the highest-ranked borrower in Europe. With its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/05/eu-could-fine-italy-3bn-for-breaking-spending-and-borrowing-rules\" title=\"\">pre-crisis debt</a> at just under 135% of GDP, Italy was perilously close to the point at which rising spreads would drive up its deficit and thus, in a vicious circle, make its debts less and less sustainable.</p> <p>To ensure that investors stay calm, it is the job of central banks to act as the buyer of last resort. But because Italy is a member of the eurozone, it no longer has an independent national central bank that can buy its debt. Its monetary policy is set by the European Central Bank, which is prohibited from directly buying a member country\u2019s newly issued debt. That left the Italians exposed. As the coronavirus crisis intensified in late February and investors became concerned by the prospect of greater state spending, the spread to German interest rates increased. If they rose too far, Italy would face not only a public health disaster but a financial crisis, too. What could Europe do to help?</p> <p>Italy already had reason to feel abandoned by its European partners: they had done little to help it tackle its chronic unemployment problem, or to take in the refugees arriving from north Africa. The coronavirus was a new test. The signs were not good: other member states were grudging in their reaction to Italy\u2019s appeals for help. But what really mattered, for the country\u2019s financial survival, was the stance taken by the ECB.</p> <p>Under its former president, Mario Draghi, the ECB had emerged in the course of the last financial crisis as the pivot of the European economy. Draghi\u2019s promise to do <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/26/eurozone-crisis-greece-bailout-barroso#block-501117ec95cb1d4f92af2233\" title=\"\">whatever it takes</a> to hold the eurozone together, uttered at the height of the crisis in July 2012, has become a mantra of modern economic policy. Faced with a financial panic, restoring confidence is key \u2013 and because a central bank is in charge of issuing currency, it is the only crisis-fighter with truly unlimited firepower.</p> <p>Northern European fiscal and monetary conservatives had always been suspicious of Draghi\u2019s interventions, which they saw as a way to transfer Italy\u2019s liabilities on to Europe\u2019s balance sheet. And his <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-ecb-policy/draghi-ties-lagardes-hands-with-promise-of-indefinite-stimulus-idUKKCN1VW2SR\" title=\"\">final round</a> of bond-buying, in 2019, proved particularly controversial. By the time he ended his stint at the ECB that autumn, it was all Angela Merkel\u2019s government in Berlin could do to ensure that there were no unseemly scenes at his retirement party.</p> <p>Christine Lagarde, the former finance minister of France and IMF boss, took over as head of the ECB in October 2019, and inherited Draghi\u2019s extraordinarily difficult position. Now she would have to demonstrate that she could handle a major financial crisis. The ECB press conference on 12 March was the crucial test.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1d392f4089b34020b6fcf7cf2f1e1c553ebcffba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d392f4089b34020b6fcf7cf2f1e1c553ebcffba/0_0_3500_2727/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Christine Lagarde seen in a German TV broadcast of the ECB\u2019s coronavirus press conference on 12 March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"779\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christine Lagarde seen in a German TV broadcast of the ECB\u2019s coronavirus press conference on 12 March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ralph Orlowski/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The ECB had good news for Europe\u2019s banks: they would receive a huge amount of low-cost funding. It was also going to buy an additional \u20ac120bn in assets \u2013 although if that was spread across the members of the Eurozone, as the rules demanded, it would hardly give Italy the support it needed. But the critical moment came when Lagarde was asked a question about the ECB\u2019s attitude to sovereign debt. Her <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-04-06/coronavirus-lagarde-s-810-billion-u-turn-came-in-just-4-weeks?srnd=premium\" title=\"\">response</a> was remarkable. \u201cWe are not here to close spreads,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is not the function or the mission of the ECB. There are other tools for that, and there are other actors to actually deal with those issues.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSpreads\u201d meant Italy. And what Lagarde seemed to be saying was that it was somebody else\u2019s problem. But if the ECB wasn\u2019t going to help Italy, who would? Did it really expect the other member states of the eurozone to string together a fiscal safety net for Italy? Obviously, given the bad blood between Italy and the northern Europeans, Lagarde had to walk a fine line. But with hundreds of people dying every day, with global financial markets in a state of repressed panic, was the ECB seriously suggesting that it would wait for Berlin, Paris and Rome to settle their differences before putting out the fire? It was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/ecb-announces-plan-to-help-eurozone-banks-withstand-coronavirus\" title=\"\">breathtaking</a>.</p> <p>For investors, Lagarde\u2019s comment came like a bolt of lightning. And within minutes, she started to backtrack. She went in front of the cameras to promise that the ECB would use the flexibility of its \u20ac120bn programme to prevent the fragmentation of the euro area \u2013 code for helping Italy. But the damage was done. The markets slumped, and the price that Italy had to pay to borrow leaped: averaged out, the spread moved by 0.65%. That may not sound like a big difference, but when applied to a mountain of debt the size of Italy\u2019s, it raises the interest bill by <a href=\"https://thegeneraltheorist.com/2020/03/15/loose-lips-cost-ships-lagardes-language-and-italys-eur14-billion-bill/\" title=\"\">as much as \u20ac14bn</a> for just one year. It was the last thing Italy needed. In a rare public rebuke, both Paris and Rome distanced themselves from the ECB. The crisis was pulling Europe further apart.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>After five terrifying days of market turmoil, the weekend of 14-15 March was a moment for central banks around the world to coordinate their response. What everyone wanted was dollars, so it was above all the Federal Reserve that needed to take the lead. And as its chair, Powell did. He called an unscheduled press conference for the afternoon of 15 March. What he announced was remarkable.</p> <p>With immediate effect, the Fed was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/15/federal-reserve-cuts-interest-rates-near-zero-prop-up-us-economy-coronavirus\" title=\"\">cutting interest rates to zero</a> \u2013 something it had done just once before, at the height of the crisis in 2008. To stabilise the US Treasury bonds market, it would be buying $700bn in a new round of so-called quantitative easing. And it would start big, buying $80bn by 17 March. In the space of just 48 hours, it would spend more on treasuries than the Fed spent in most months in the aftermath of 2008.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f17764cd536915f3b57efb88144f5c1a9dca6b32\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f17764cd536915f3b57efb88144f5c1a9dca6b32/0_0_6240_4160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The New York Stock Exchange on 16 March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The New York Stock Exchange on 16 March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Spencer Platt/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These were measures for the US economy. But the coronavirus was a global problem. The flight to safety and the ensuing rise in the dollar had put pressure on everyone who had borrowed in the US currency. So, to ensure that dollars could be piped to every financial institution in every major financial centre in the world, the Fed announced that it was <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fed-swaps/fed-increases-frequency-of-swap-line-operations-with-other-major-central-banks-idUKKBN21726G\" title=\"\">improving the terms</a> on the so-called liquidity swap lines \u2013 deals by which the major central banks agree to exchange dollars for sterling, euros, swiss francs and yen in unlimited amounts.</p> <p>Powell was deploying the main weapons of the 2008 crisis with far greater speed than his predecessors ever had. But it was still not enough. When the markets opened the next day, 16 March, the fall was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/16/markets-hit-by-further-losses-despite-us-interest-rate-cut-willie-walsh-ba-coronavirus\" title=\"\">vertiginous</a>. The circuit-breakers are supposed to come into effect if the market falls by more than 7%. That morning, the fall was so quick that the S&amp;P 500 dropped by 8.1% before trading could be stopped. The so-called fear index, VIX \u2013 a measure of market volatility \u2013 surged to levels last seen in the dark days of November 2008.</p> <p>The fear in the markets was now feeding on itself. If the Fed\u2019s magic of 2008 no longer worked, then what would?</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>The foreign exchange market, where currencies are traded, is the biggest market in the world. And the place where the most transactions are booked is the City of London. On an average day, transactions back and forth total $6.6tn. But on Wednesday 18 March, there was only one trade: people wanted to sell everything. The only thing they wanted to buy were dollars. Every other currency was falling.</p> <p>The central banks\u2019 failure to calm the markets had set the stage for the worst days of the panic. Coronavirus cases were piling up in Europe more rapidly than at the peak of the crisis in Wuhan. Hedge funds were placing multi-billion-dollar bets that the recession in Europe would be protracted. Blue chip companies like Apple were facing stiff premiums to borrow for as little as three months ahead. Even gold, a classic safe haven, was selling.</p> <p>That Wednesday, on his third day as governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey organised a press conference in an effort at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/mar/19/stock-markets-fall-ecb-coronavirus-stimulus-sterling-oil-prices-ftse-dollar-business-live?page=with:block-5e739e0d8f085c6327bc32ab#block-5e739e0d8f085c6327bc32ab\" title=\"\">reassurance</a>. But as he was speaking, sterling plunged by 5% to its lowest level since 1985. Meanwhile, the market for UK government bonds, also known as gilts \u2013 the oldest major asset market in the world \u2013 was witnessing unprecedented turmoil. It was, in Bailey\u2019s understated phrasing, \u201cbordering on the disorderly\u201d.</p> <p>In response, the Bank of England monetary policy committee met the next day in emergency session and announced that the Bank would be buying \u00a3200bn in gilts. Unlike in 2008, it would not be doing so on a prearranged schedule. As Bailey explained: \u201cWe will act in the markets promptly and rapidly as we see appropriate.\u201d This was no time for timetables. The central bank was, by its own admission, flying by the seat of its pants.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9a2f52d27f5e8cae8f0fcceaee2c9c1738dda8aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a2f52d27f5e8cae8f0fcceaee2c9c1738dda8aa/0_61_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The governor of the Bank of England, Andrew Bailey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tolga Akmen/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On an emergency conference call on the evening of 18 March, the ECB executive board decided that it, too, needed to act. Under a <a href=\"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2020/html/ecb.pr200318_1~3949d6f266.en.html\" title=\"\">pandemic</a> <a href=\"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2020/html/ecb.pr200318_1~3949d6f266.en.html\" title=\"\">emergency</a> <a href=\"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2020/html/ecb.pr200318_1~3949d6f266.en.html\" title=\"\">purchase</a> <a href=\"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2020/html/ecb.pr200318_1~3949d6f266.en.html\" title=\"\">programme</a>, it announced that it would begin by buying \u20ac750bn of government and corporate debt. But the ECB was willing to go even further than that. It said that, if necessary, it would revise some of its \u201cself-imposed limits\u201d.</p> <p>For an institution as hidebound as the ECB, this amounted to a revolution. Self-imposed limits \u2013 inflation targets, rules on which European government\u2019s debt it could buy and in what quantities \u2013 are what the ECB lives by. It is clear that conservative members of the bank\u2019s governing council <a href=\"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/accounts/2020/html/ecb.mg200409_1~baf4b2ad06.en.html\" title=\"\">continued to resist such a move</a>. But in the end it was the turmoil in the markets that decided the issue. The ECB needed to send a signal of determination. If Lagarde had fluffed her \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d moment, the ECB was now at least promising to do whatever was necessary.</p> <p>By the end of the third week of March, 39 central banks around the world, from Mongolia to Trinidad, had lowered interest rates, eased banking regulations and set up special lending facilities. To ease the pressure on emerging markets, the Fed widened the network of liquidity swap lines to cover 14 major economies including Mexico, Brazil and South Korea. This was a remarkable wave of activism. But the pandemic itself was only beginning to bite. Central banks could cushion the financial shock, but not address the actual economic implosion, let alone the health crisis.</p> <p>European governments had been quick to move. Germany had thrown aside its fiscal caution and was committed to a <a href=\"https://www.thelocal.de/20200406/german-government-to-guarantee-100-percent-of-loans-to-smaller-firms-in-coronavirus-aid-package\" title=\"\">gigantic programme</a> of government guarantees for business lending. But this made all the more glaring the gap to Italy and Spain, which were not only hardest hit by the virus, but also constrained by the financial legacy of the eurozone crisis. They did not want to risk sliding back into a debt crisis.</p> <p>In the US, the Fed had leaped into action. But where were the politicians? Congress was distracted by the upcoming presidential election. What was needed was an unprecedented rescue package for an economy in freefall. How were Republicans and Democrats to reconcile fundamental differences over health care and unemployment insurance, or the notorious cronyism of the president and his clan? Since the Democrats had won control of the House of Representatives in 2018, legislation had been largely paralysed. Now, in the face of a tsunami of job losses, the two parties had to come to an agreement.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>As trading began in Asia early on the morning of Monday 23 March, the news from Washington made it clear that there had been no deal on Capitol Hill. The futures markets plunged so violently that circuit breakers were activated again \u2013 by now this had happened an unprecedented five times in two weeks. If it wanted to avoid a meltdown when Wall Street opened, the Fed would have to make another move.</p> <p>Until this point, Jerome Powell had been moving in the shadow of his predecessor, Ben Bernanke, who had been Fed chair in 2008. But by 23 March, Powell had activated all the basic elements of the 2008 repertoire \u2013 slashing interest rates, using quantitative easing, supporting money markets. But it had not worked, partly because it could not reach the source of the crisis itself \u2013 that is, the virus and the lockdown \u2013 and also because it was not reaching the bit of the credit system that was most vulnerable in 2020: the borrowing by big corporations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5bf09ffecba39cac687aba04e5611469e2d4e1e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5bf09ffecba39cac687aba04e5611469e2d4e1e8/0_181_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"US Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Fed has always steered clear of corporate debt, which it considered politically sensitive. If you bought debt from individual firms, you were vulnerable to accusations of favouritism. If you bought a cross-section of debt you ended up holding many very poor-quality loans. But by the early hours of 23 March, it was clear that something had to be done to stabilise the corporate debt market. Since 2008, bonds issued by non-financial corporations have surged from $3.3tn to more than $6.5tn. If their value fell too far, US corporations would not only face shutdowns and a complete loss of revenue, but also a crippling credit squeeze.</p> <p>Ideally, the Fed would have made a grand announcement in conjunction with a Congressional stimulus package. But by the evening of 22 March, it was clear that the package being proposed by the Republicans was unacceptable to the Democrats. It might take days for them to square the difference. The financial markets would not wait.</p> <p>On 23 March, 90 minutes before markets opened, Powell made his move. He announced that the Fed was setting up legal entities \u2013 off the books of the Fed, but guaranteed by it \u2013 that would have the capacity to buy highly rated corporate debt, or at least any debt that the ratings agencies were still willing to declare investment-grade. In effect, the Fed was establishing itself as the backstop to the trillion-dollar corporate bond market. The Fed ramped up its asset-purchase programme, to an astonishing $375bn in Treasury securities and $250bn in mortgage securities in a single week.</p> <p>It was an extraordinary move to widen the scope of central bank intervention into the corporate economy. And it was understood as such by the markets. Since the start of the year, the S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Jones, as well as the FTSE 100, had lost 30% of their value. That day, they began to recover.</p> <p>Two days later, on 25 March, backing arrived from Congress when the Senate passed its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/senate-passes-coronavirus-stimulus-package\" title=\"\">giant package of $2tn</a> \u2013 more than twice the size of the stimulus bill passed in 2009. It provided funds to top up unemployment insurance, to support small businesses and the US\u2019s privatised hospital system. Crucially, it also set aside $454bn to cover Fed losses. Since most loans would not be expected to go bad, this would enable the Fed to make more than $4tn in loans, if necessary.</p> <p>In the US, the public health campaign against the virus was still a shambles. But as far as economic policy was concerned, the full power of the American state was now being deployed behind the emergency programme. And the Fed was also acting as a provider of dollar liquidity to the world economy. In the UK, too, the Treasury and the Bank of England were working closely to link the huge increase in government spending to efforts to stabilise financial markets.</p> <p>But in the eurozone, that kind of coordination was lacking. The ECB had managed to stop the immediate panic. Yet there was still the question of whether the member states could come up with a financial plan to support their hardest-hit neighbours, Italy and Spain. The obvious solution was to issue debt jointly to fight the crisis together \u2013 an idea raised repeatedly during the eurozone crisis, when it had been bitterly resisted by a conservative northern European coalition led by Germany. This would ensure that Italy was not constrained by its pre-existing financial weakness.</p> <p>For a coalition of nine states led by France, Italy, Spain and Portugal, the case was obvious. On 25 March they called for a \u201ccommon debt instrument\u201d to fund a crisis response. The ECB threw itself energetically behind the proposal. But, once again, the Netherlands and Germany <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/apr/11/eu-coronavirus-relief-deal-enemies-debt-eurozone\" title=\"\">refused to budge</a>. The issue was shoved off into the Eurogroup, a meeting of the eurozone\u2019s finance ministers, where the outline of a deal did finally emerge two weeks later. By then the immediate panic had passed. As Lagarde and her central banking colleagues had feared from the outset, it was on their shoulders that the stability of the eurozone continued to rest.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Will the massive financial firewalls built by central banks on both sides of the Atlantic be enough to withstand the bad news that is headed our way over the coming weeks and months? It is too early to tell. But the first test came on Thursday 26 March, when the US Department of Labor announced that, in a single week, 3.3 million Americans had signed on for unemployment insurance. It was completely unprecedented. A graph stretching back half a century simply turns upwards in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/26/us-unemployment-rate-coronavirus-business\" title=\"\">vertical surge</a>. In the next two weeks, another 13.5 million people would be added to the insurance rolls. And there was no end in sight. America is on pace for national unemployment to reach 30% by the summer \u2013 greater than during the Great Depression of the 1930s.</p> <p>The shutdown spelled disaster for millions of American families, at least half of whom have no financial reserves to speak of, and for businesses up and down the land. How would the markets react? Astonishingly, they ended 26 March up 5%. The largest surge in unemployment ever recorded in history was met with a relaxed shrug.</p> <p>Why weren\u2019t investors more terrified? Because the scale of Congressional stimulus made clear that, no matter how divided American politics were, that wouldn\u2019t stand in the way of a huge surge of spending. And the Fed, for its part, would make sure that the huge flow of new debt was absorbed, if necessary on to its own accounts. The private credit system, the government budget and the balance sheet of the Fed were welded together in a closed loop.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>What the Fed, the Bank of England and the ECB managed to do in March was prevent the damage caused by the shutdown being made even worse by an immediate collapse of corporate credit. At the same time, by stabilising sovereign debt markets, they have enabled a huge surge in public spending to fight the crisis and cushion its social and economic side effects. To do this they have both widened the safety net to parts of the financial system never before protected, and intervened on a scale far greater even than in 2008.</p> <p>In the final days of March, the Federal Reserve was buying Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities at the rate of $83bn per day, or just shy of $1m per second. On 9 April, at the same moment as the latest horrifying unemployment numbers were released, it announced <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200409a.htm\" title=\"\">another $2.3</a><a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20200409a.htm\" title=\"\">tn</a> in support targeted specifically at municipal debt and lower-grade corporate debt. That same day, the Bank of England adopted an even more radical approach. Rather than going through the process of having the Treasury issue debt that would then be bought by the central bank, it announced that it would be offering <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/09/bank-of-england-to-finance-uk-government-covid-19-crisis-spending\" title=\"\">direct monetary finance</a> to the government, to provide it with whatever funding it needed. This would be temporary, but it was still a radical move. The government\u2019s current account at the Bank of England would be repurposed to allow, if necessary, tens of billions of pounds in coronavirus spending. The last time the British government resorted to this mechanism was at the height of the crisis in 2008.</p> <p>What we have seen in the financial system, over the past few weeks, is a victory of sorts \u2013 but it is a defensive one. Once again, we are propping up a fragile, profit-driven system to avoid something even worse. It is also a victory limited in scope.</p> <p>By flattening the curve of financial panic, the central banks of advanced economies have managed to ensure that life under the lockdown is not made even more unbearable by the shutting off of credit to business and households. They have also ensured that the public health response to Covid-19 can proceed at any scale that is required. Within Europe, there are questions about the differences between eurozone members: Germany has been able to deliver a conspicuously larger fiscal response to the crisis than have Italy or Spain. But those inequalities pale next to the problems facing much of the rest of the world. There the crucial supply of credit is being cut off even before coronavirus cases begin to mount, meaning, once again we have confirmed that the global financial system is hierarchical. At the apex stands the US Federal Reserve. The ECB, the Bank of Japan, the Bank of England and their advanced-economy counterparts all enjoy the Fed\u2019s direct support. Thanks in no small part to that support, the advanced-economy central banks enjoy great latitude in propping up their credit systems. They might face moderate movements in their currency\u2019s exchange rate, but no devastating financial squeeze.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/how-will-the-world-emerge-from-the-coronavirus-crisis\">\u2018We can\u2019t go back to normal\u2019: how will coronavirus change the world?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That is what the emerging-market economies have been suffering since February.

Could we all be part of a complex simulation?</p> <p>Devs is masterminded by Alex Garland, famous for writing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jul/02/alex-garland-the-beach-20-years-on\">The Beach</a> and directing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/22/ex-machina-review\">Ex</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/22/ex-machina-review\"> Machina</a>.

Its reception in the US has shown what British viewers can expect when it begins on BBC Two this week: give it enough time and it will consume your every waking thought.</p> <p>And yet the strangest thing about Devs is that the beating heart of this very serious show is Nick Offerman. Yes, Nick Offerman from comedy. Nick Offerman from <a href=\"https://offermanwoodshop.com/\">woodwork</a>. Nick Offerman from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/14/how-we-made-parks-and-recreation-amy-poehler-nick-offerman-mike-schur\">Parks and Recreation</a>, the satirical US series about an Indiana town\u2019s parks department in which he played Ron Swanson, the libertarian, anti-government boss striving to make his department as ineffective as possible.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I have a lot of experience of making people laugh. But also making them cringe, vomit and sob</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Speaking from his home in LA, where he\u2019s under lockdown, Offerman seems as surprised about this career turn as anyone. \u201cAny farm boy like myself, that packed up and went off to theatre school, is chasing the dream of working with a person like Alex,\u201d he says. \u201cI was working at my woodwork shop when I got the call that he wanted to meet with me, and I teared up a little bit. In my world, it was not expected that someone like Alex would turn his gaze in my direction.\u201d</p> <p>Nevertheless, it\u2019s perfect casting. Offerman plays Forest, a conspiratorial tech CEO so ravaged with grief for his dead daughter that he\u2019s built a giant statue of her on the grounds of his campus. Amaya, his quantum computing company, is being investigated by engineer Lily Chan, who believes it is responsible for the disappearance of her boyfriend. Although Forest starts the series as an out-and-out villain (and it\u2019s great to see Offerman use his physical heft for something other than excessive meat consumption), we gradually see a more humane side as we understand the rationale for his time-bending invention.</p> <p>How does he feel about the central theme, the question of whether we live in a deterministic universe? \u201cI love ruminating about the big existential questions,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I was brought up in a family of salt-of-the-earth public servants, in the middle of Illinois, in the middle of America. I can wrap my head around the science of determinism, but in my everyday life, it\u2019s the last thing I can think about because I\u2019m usually in the middle of choosing the sandwich I\u2019ll be having for lunch \u2013 and then the slightly larger, warmer sandwich I\u2019ll be having for dinner.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a60c59d997dd881e0a9aa4663c095394a0bed751\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a60c59d997dd881e0a9aa4663c095394a0bed751/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alison Pill and Nick Offerman in Devs.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Big questions \u2026 Alison Pill and Nick Offerman in Devs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Raymond Liu</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s a very Offerman answer, rooted in both good-hearted Americana and food. Time and time again during our interview, he\u2019ll return to these twin wells, bringing up the morals that were instilled in him by his family and comparing TV reviews to various types of fast food (\u201cWho put gruyere in this cheeseburger? Are you insane? One star!\u201d).</p> <p>Offerman, 49, was born in the tiny village of Minooka to a mother who was a nurse and a father who taught social studies at high school. He\u2019s one of four children and much of his growing up was done on a soybean farm, which is just the sort of quirky background detail that could belong to his most famous character. In fact, if you close your eyes, you feel like you could be talking to Ron Swanson. And this might be becoming a problem.</p> <p>Although Parks and Recreation finished half a decade ago, people still have a tendency to see Offerman through the lens of Swanson. It\u2019s understandable \u2013 the character incorporated many of Offerman\u2019s traits: his flair for woodwork, his talent with a saxophone and his outward projection of gruff manliness. It\u2019s a comparison that Offerman has played up, with books like <a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/314287/paddle-your-own-canoe-by-nick-offerman/\">Paddle Your Own Canoe</a> and a standup tour called <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/70299862\">American Ham</a>. But enough is enough. On his most recent comedy tour, Offerman took to singing a song entitled I\u2019m Not Ron Swanson, which contained the lines: \u201cHe can eat a big-ass steak for every single meal / \u2019Cause his colon is fictitious, while mine is all too real.\u201d</p> <p>Was the song born of frustration? \u201cIt\u2019s a little complicated,\u201d he says, \u201cbecause people want to conflate me with Ron Swanson\u2019s politics. He\u2019s a staunch libertarian, and I\u2019m interested in everybody having healthcare or being paid a living wage. When I used to look at social media more closely, there would be angry fans saying, \u2018I brought my shotgun to your comedy show and it turns out you\u2019re a total snowflake.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c6b6044b9498521f77c7d22ea207a2de46a96cbc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c6b6044b9498521f77c7d22ea207a2de46a96cbc/39_76_2655_1593/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2026 alongside Amy Poehler in Parks and Recreation.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Green shoots of genius \u2026 alongside Amy Poehler in Parks and Recreation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In truth, the two are poles apart. Offerman took two semesters of ballet. He toured Japan doing kabuki theatre. He repeatedly refers to himself as the black sheep of the family, who cries easily and believes Yoko Ono <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpCQ5yWUx7g\">is a misunderstood genius</a>. He\u2019s thoughtful and articulate on gender and race, and very concerned with the issue of sustainable food.</p> <p>There were other downsides to playing Swanson, too. \u201cI couldn\u2019t go to a restaurant. No matter what I ordered, they would put an inch-thick layer of bacon on my plate. I\u2019d order a cheeseburger and they\u2019d make me a one-pound cheeseburger. And I would give them a thumbs-up and hear my cardiologist screaming in my head.\u201d</p> <p>Yet there have always been many sides to Offerman. As well as the tours, the books (four in seven years), his parallel career running a woodshop in LA, and the <a href=\"https://www.earwolf.com/show/in-bed-with-nick-offerman-and-megan-mullally/\">intimate podcast</a> he and his wife Megan Mullally host from their bed, Offerman has amassed a wildly varied filmography. There has been voice work in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jul/14/ice-age-collision-course-review\">Ice Age</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/13/the-lego-movie-review\">Lego</a> movies, prestigious Oscar bait in the form of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/feb/19/the-founder-review-michael-keaton-mcdonalds-biopic\">The Founder</a>, and such heartfelt little indie films as 2018\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/aug/03/hearts-beat-loud-review-warm-indie-drama\">Hearts Beat Loud</a>. Then there are TV appearances in Curb Your Enthusiasm, Will &amp; Grace and Fargo.</p> <p>\u201cI come from theatre,\u201d he says, referring to Defiant Theater, the experimental Chicago company he co-founded in the early 1990s, winning rave reviews for productions that included everything from Shakespeare to Stephen King. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a street theatre actor, that means you try to perform in a myriad of genres. Whatever\u2019s on that season. So you might do a Sam Shepard play, then maybe a musical. I have a lot of experience on stage of making people laugh certainly \u2013 but also making people cringe, vomit and sob.\u201d</p> <p>Yet Devs feels like his greatest leap so far. It\u2019s a tremendous performance that sees Offerman shuttling between menace, vulnerability, goofiness and outright terror. Perhaps most impressive is the way that, as of a character who can see the future and therefore can never be surprised, he\u2019s able to give such a relatable human performance.

What is this Windup Bird Chronicle? This is madness.\u2019 But then there will be 15% of people that say, \u2018Oh my god, that was the best book I\u2019ve ever read.\u2019 There is a quote I wear on my sleeve that goes, \u2018If you\u2019re not offending 33% of your audience, then it\u2019s not art.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f23da1707ab1decf615009f6337849863d42b54b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f23da1707ab1decf615009f6337849863d42b54b/259_594_2922_1753/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2026 Offerman (right) with Karl Glusman in Devs.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beguiling \u2026 Offerman (right) with Karl Glusman in Devs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Raymond Liu/BBC/FX Networks</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This does not seem like a particularly optimal time to be promoting a TV series, with the world gripped by coronavirus. Does it feel strange? \u201cWell, it does,\u201d he says. \u201cI mean, everything is kind of strange. For those of us whose work involves outputting any sort of content to an audience, everything has to be couched with sensitivity to the tragedy unfolding all around us.</p> <p>\u201cFortunately, the greater percentage of us will get through this. A lot of people are suffering and perishing at the hands of the deadly virus. But there are exponentially more people suffering and dying because of the incredible bed-shitting that our administration has performed. The failure \u2013 the face-plant of our government in the face of this pandemic \u2013 has been unbelievably embarrassing and shameful. And continues to be so. I mean, that sad clown just continues to dance and bleat as though the stock market will somehow save him from the incredibly gory butcher\u2019s bill he is being presented with.\u201d</p> <p>He takes a breath. \u201cBut to answer your question, I\u2019m glad \u2013 because I think our show is just magnificent.\u201d</p> <p>Offerman is a reassuring man to talk to in a crisis. There\u2019s a lot of solace to be had in his mixture of political fury and good-natured idealism. \u201cAs an eternal optimist,\u201d he says, \u201cmy hope is that something might come out of this time of reflection, where we\u2019re all being made to hold still for a while. Perhaps when it\u2019s over, we will walk outside and look at a tree, or reacquaint ourselves with squirrels and birds in our neighbourhood, and say, \u2018Oh, there is beauty, there is worth, there is incredible value to the world and to life. And it doesn\u2019t come through my phone, it doesn\u2019t come through consumerism, it doesn\u2019t come from capitalism.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Another deep breath. \u201cI had the good fortune of growing up in a frugal and loving family, so I understood that we can have a beautiful and rewarding life without having three Porsches in the garage. Having three Porsches is not actually that great, because you have to pay to maintain three Porsches. But if you instead get together with your family and build a canoe or a rowboat, you only need one of those.

  "<p>A toddler threw a self-pitying tantrum on live television on Monday night. Unfortunately he was 73 years old, wearing a long red tie and running the world\u2019s most powerful country.</p> \n<p>Donald Trump, starved of campaign rallies, Mar-a-Lago weekends and golf, and goaded by a bombshell newspaper report, couldn\u2019t take it any more. Years of accreted grievance and resentment towards the media came gushing out in a torrent. He ranted, he raved, he melted down and he blew up the internet with one of the most jaw-dropping performances of his presidency.</p> \n<p>This was, as he likes to put it, \u201ca 10\u201d.</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s Easter had evidently been ruined by a damning 5,500-word <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/11/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-response.html\">New York Times investigation</a> showing that Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/28/trump-coronavirus-politics-us-health-disaster\">squandered precious time</a> in January and February as numerous government figures were sounding the alarm about the coronavirus.</p> \n<p>With more than 23,000 American lives lost in such circumstances, some presidents might now be considering resignation. Not Trump. He arrived in the west wing briefing room determined to tell the world, or at least his base, that he was not to blame. Instead it was a new and bloody phase of his war against the \u201cenemy of the people\u201d: the media. Families grieving loved ones lost to the virus were in for cold comfort here.</p> \n<p>A CNN chyron is a worth a thousand words: \u201cTrump refuses to acknowledge any mistakes\u201d; \u201cTrump uses task force briefing to try and rewrite history on coronavirus response\u201d; \u201cTrump melts down in angry response to reports he ignored virus warnings\u201d; \u201cAngry Trump turns briefing into propaganda session\u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/28/trump-coronavirus-politics-us-health-disaster\">The missing six weeks: how Trump failed the biggest test of his life</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The thin-skinned president lashed out at reporters, swiped at Democrat Joe Biden and refused to accept that he had put a foot wrong. \u201cSo the story in the New York Times is a total fake, it\u2019s a fake newspaper and they write fake stories. And someday, hopefully in five years when I\u2019m not here, those papers are all going out of business because nobody\u2019s going to read them,\u201d Trump said.</p> \n<p>With a dramatic flourish, the president ordered the briefing room lights dimmed. In a James Bond film, it would be the moment that poisoned gas is piped into the room. What happened wasn\u2019t far off: a campaign-style montage of video clips, shown on screens set up behind the podium. There was footage of doctors saying in January that the coronavirus did not pose an imminent threat, Trump declaring a national emergency, and Democratic governors praising him for providing federal assistance.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ec0004ee-1781-494e-bef7-29f367f4fac0\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LUXsgVA8lN8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Veteran White House reporters said they could never remember such a film being played in that room. It had been put together in a couple of hours by Dan Scavino, the director of social media at the White House, and a team in less than two hours, Trump explained. \u201cWe could give you hundreds of clips like that.\u201d</p> \n<p>Jon Karl of ABC News asked in consternation: \u201cWhy did you feel the need to do that?\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump replied: \u201cBecause we\u2019re getting fake news and I like to have it corrected ... Everything we did was right.\u201d</p> \n<p>Over and over, Trump highlighted his decision to ban some flights from China in late January before there were any virus-related deaths confirmed in the US \u2013 even though nearly 400,000 people travelled to the US from China before the restrictions were in place and 40,000 people have arrived there since.</p> \n<p>The CBS News correspondent Paula Reid was having none of it and cut to the chase. \u201cThe argument is that you bought yourself some time,\u201d she said \u201cYou didn\u2019t use it to prepare hospitals. You didn\u2019t use it to ramp up testing. Right now, nearly 20m people are unemployed. Tens of thousands of Americans are dead.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump talked over her: \u201cYou\u2019re so disgraceful. It\u2019s so disgraceful the way you say that.\u201d</p> \n<p>Reid demanded: \u201cHow is this newsreel or this rant supposed to make people feel confident in an unprecedented crisis?\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump reverted to his China travel restrictions but Reid continued to push him on his inaction in February. Trump was unable to muster a reasonable response. It was a case study in how, when he loses an argument, his instinct is to attack the accuser. He trotted out his frayed, timeworn insult: \u201cYou know you\u2019re a fake, your whole network the way you cover it is fake ... That\u2019s why you have a lower approval rating than probably you\u2019ve ever had before times three.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"77edb96d-dd13-483c-9b76-b251d47d2ca8\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/r3QXrQDTDYo?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Democrats can only hope Biden was watching Reid for tips on how to debate the president.</p> \n<p>Earlier, Dr Anthony Fauci stepped to the podium to clarify that he had been responding to a \u201chypothetical question\u201d during an appearance on CNN\u2019s State of the Union programme on Sunday when he said more could have been done to save American lives. He denied he was being forced to clarify against his will.</p> \n<p>Trump, who had retweeted a post containing the hashtag \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/13/trump-fauci-tweets-speculation-fire\">#FireFauci</a>\u201d, said: \u201cToday I walk in, I hear I\u2019m going to fire him. I\u2019m not firing him, I think he\u2019s a wonderful guy.\u201d </p> \n<p>The briefing went on for well over two hours. Even Fox News gave up before the end. Adam Schiff, the chair of the House intelligence committee, spoke for many when he tweeted: \u201cWhy do reputable news organizations carry these daily Trump press conferences live?</p> \n<p>\u201cThey are filled with misinformation and propaganda.

  "<p>As Joe Biden scored a widely expected win in the Wisconsin Democratic presidential primary, a liberal challenger for a state supreme court seat declared victory in an upset hailed by Democrats as boding well for the presidential election in November.</p> <p>The state supreme court is expected to rule in numerous voting rights cases in the lead-up to November\u2019s election, including a case in which 200,000 voters could be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/06/wisconsin-voter-purges-black-student-populations-risk\">purged from voter rolls</a>. Wisconsin is a swing state that narrowly voted for Donald Trump four years ago.</p> <p>With most precincts in the state reporting, Judge Jill Karofsky held what looked like an insurmountable lead over the conservative state supreme court justice Daniel Kelly.</p> <p>In a victory statement, Karofsky thanked supporters and condemned the Republican-led legislature for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/07/wisconsin-votes-controversial-election-coronavirus-us-election-2020\">forcing voters</a> to the polls a week earlier amid the coronavirus outbreak.</p> <p>The state\u2019s Democratic governor, Tony Evers, had attempted to postpone the election, but he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/06/wisconsin-primary-election-in-person-voting-coronavirus\">rebuffed</a> by the Republican-led legislature and the conservative-controlled state supreme court.</p> <p>\u201cAlthough we were successful in this race, the circumstances under which this election was conducted were simply unacceptable, and raise serious concerns for the future of our democracy,\u201d Karofsky said in a statement. \u201cNobody in this state or in this country should have been forced to choose between their safety and participating in an election.\u201d</p> <p>Biden, the presumptive Democratic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/09/biden-2020-bernie-election-trump-coronavirus\">presidential nominee</a>, had held a large lead in polls before the vote was held. His main opponent, Bernie Sanders, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/08/bernie-sanders-ends-2020-presidential-race\">dropped out</a> of the presidential nominating race the day after the vote.

Owing to a lack of poll workers amid the pandemic, the election was conducted with just five Milwaukee polling sites.</p> <p>A typical statewide election would be conducted with about 180 sites for the city.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/10/wisconsin-voter-restrictions-democracy-coronavirus-primary\">Wisconsin: the state where American democracy went to die</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Long lines of voters wearing masks and trying to keep their distance from one another materialized nevertheless.</p> <p>\u201cThey could have delayed the election with no problem,\u201d an elderly voter in Madison, Wisconsin, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/aa523f32485973008fb954f7ef4e4b04\">told the Associated Press</a>. \u201cThey decided if they can suppress the vote in Milwaukee and Madison, where you have a large minority presence, you can get people elected you want elected.

Had justice prevailed, those numbers would have been zero. No one should ever have to choose between their health and their vote, yet Republicans chose to prioritize their own political gain over actual human lives.\u201d</p> <p>Karofsky\u2019s apparent win could have national implications, with the state supreme court likely to decide multiple cases that could shape the November presidential election in a key swing state. One such case could result in the purge of 200,000 voters from the state\u2019s registration rolls.</p> <p>Donald Trump strongly endorsed Kelly, tweeting on election day, \u201cProtect your 2nd Amendment!\u201d and \u201cA BIG VOTE!\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/06/wisconsin-voter-purges-black-student-populations-risk\">Revealed: Wisconsin's black and student populations at highest risk of voter purges</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In endorsing Biden, Sanders called for Trump\u2019s defeat.</p> <p>\u201cSo today, I am asking all Americans, I\u2019m asking every Democrat, I\u2019m asking every independent, I\u2019m asking a lot of Republicans, to come together in this campaign to support your candidacy, which I endorse,\u201d Sanders said.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to make Trump a one-term president.\u201d</p>"
