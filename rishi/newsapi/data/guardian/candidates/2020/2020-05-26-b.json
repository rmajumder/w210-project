The US rights organisation Freedom House classified Hungary as a \u201chybrid regime\u201d this year, placing the country somewhere between a democracy and an autocracy.</p> <p>Hungarian government officials have seized on some incorrect international reporting that claimed that parliament had been suspended, saying all international criticism of the measures was \u201cfake news\u201d. Although the measures are likely to end by the end of next month, Orb\u00e1n\u2019s critics say this should not obscure the damage done, which follows a decade of gradual erosion of democratic norms in Hungary.</p> <p>More than 100 decrees have been issued since April, some of which appeared to have little direct relevance to fighting coronavirus, such as those that stripped opposition-led municipalities of decision-making power and financial resources.</p> <p>A separate measure also included potential prison sentences for spreading false information. Although no cases have yet come to court under the decree, police have launched more than 100 investigations and in some cases have hauled citizens in for questioning over critical Facebook posts.</p> <p>The emergency laws \u201cstill have a month to go, and we also don\u2019t know which measures will remain in place after the state of danger is ended\u201d, said P\u00e9ter Krek\u00f3, who runs the Political Capital thinktank in Budapest.</p> <p>During the past two months, parliament has also passed a number of controversial legislative bills in the normal way, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/19/hungary-votes-to-end-legal-recognition-of-trans-people\">one that strips transgender people of legal recognition</a>.</p> <p>Varga said the emergency legislation had allowed the government \u201cto act quickly and effectively against the pandemic\u201d.

  "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s favourite hobbies seem to consist of golf, Twitter and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jun/26/muslim-americans-trump-travel-ban\">banning people from the US</a>. Alas, he may no longer have the opportunity to do as much of the latter, because who would now want to come to the US anyway? The country is doing such a bad job of containing coronavirus that you are better off almost anywhere else. Indeed, last month, a number of American citizens in Lebanon declined a repatriation offer, saying they were <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/09/middleeast/us-citizens-lebanon-coronavirus-intl/index.html\">safer in Beirut</a>.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just a trip to the US that looks unappealing right now; it seems many countries aren\u2019t exactly salivating at the prospect of hosting American visitors in the near future. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, for example, called the border with the US a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/travel/article/us-canada-border-coronavirus/index.html\">clear \u201cvulnerability\u201d</a> for Canada in terms of infections; the US-Canada border has been closed since March, and will remain closed to nonessential travel until at least 21 June.</p> <p>Meanwhile, officials in Mexican border cities are reportedly <a href=\"http://www.therepublic.com/2020/05/24/lt-virus-outbreak-mexico-border/\">tightening checks</a> on visitors from Texas, because they\u2019re worried new coronavirus cases are coming from the <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/health/in-mexican-border-cities-many-fear-virus-is-coming-from-us\">American side of the border</a>. Which brings to mind a joke that is going around: what borders on stupidity? Canada and Mexico.</p> <p>An American passport used to be an asset, now it\u2019s looking rather more like a liability. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.afar.com/magazine/is-italy-reopening-and-when-will-i-be-able-to-visit\">Italy </a><a href=\"https://www.afar.com/magazine/is-italy-reopening-and-when-will-i-be-able-to-visit\">plans to </a><a href=\"https://www.afar.com/magazine/is-italy-reopening-and-when-will-i-be-able-to-visit\">reopen to </a><a href=\"https://www.afar.com/magazine/is-italy-reopening-and-when-will-i-be-able-to-visit\">travellers on June 3 \u2013but </a><a href=\"https://www.afar.com/magazine/is-italy-reopening-and-when-will-i-be-able-to-visit\">not to Americans</a>\u201d ran a recent headline in the travel magazine Afar. This is somewhat misleading: Italy is opening its borders and removing quarantine restrictions only for people from other countries in Europe, it is not singling out Americans. However, Americans aren\u2019t used to being told they can\u2019t do things and a screenshot of the article <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_amburgerrr/status/1263225000171102220?s=20\">quickly went viral</a>.</p> <p>While Italy might not have explicitly implemented an American ban (yet), it seems increasingly likely that \u2013 as the <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/with-coronavirus-american-travelers-are-about-to-find-out-what-its-like-to-be-the-pariah\">Daily Beast</a> put it \u2013 \u201cAmerican travellers are about to be pariahs in this new world.\u201d The travel industry is still figuring out how to keep tourists safe, but it makes sense that countries doing a good job of managing the pandemic will heavily restrict entry to travellers from those doing a poor job. And the US is doing an extremely poor job.</p> <p>Most worryingly, it feels as if Trump has given up trying to pretend to do any sort of job at all. The US neared the morbid milestone of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/24/new-york-times-front-page-1000-covid-19-death-notices\">100,000 dead </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/24/new-york-times-front-page-1000-covid-19-death-notices\">at the weekend</a>; Trump marked the occasion by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/25/donald-trump-twitter-coronavirus-golfing\">going to play golf</a> (without a mask) and shaking people\u2019s hands. When he wasn\u2019t teeing off he was mouthing off: calling Hillary Clinton a \u201cskank\u201d and ordering that states <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/22/donald-trump-churches-mosques-synagogues-reopen\">reopen places of worship</a>. It seems inevitable that Trump is going to do his best to open up the country way before it is safe, just because he is worried about the economy and his chances of re-election. Plus, Covid-19 is not exactly killing his base: it is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/12/coronavirus-us-deep-south-poverty-race-perfect-storm\">disproportionately killing African</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/12/coronavirus-us-deep-south-poverty-race-perfect-storm\"> Americans</a>. To paraphrase <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/nov/04/george-w-bush-kanye-west\">Kanye West</a>\u2019s comments about George W Bush, I don\u2019t really think Trump cares about black people.</p> <p>\u201cThe coronavirus scenario I can\u2019t stop thinking about is the one where we simply get used to all the dying,\u201d the New York Times columnist Charlie Warzel <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/05/opinion/coronavirus-deaths.html\">wrote earlier this month</a>. Just as America has grown resigned to school shootings and preventable gun violence, he suggests, it looks as if it is becoming numb to Covid-19 deaths. Just as the US has prioritised the rallying call of \u201cfreedom\u201d over common sense gun control, it looks set to prioritise \u201cfreedom\u201d over public health. Looking at images from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/25/americans-defy-covid-19-social-distancing-rules-to-celebrate-memorial-day-holiday\">crowded pool parties</a> in Missouri over the weekend, looking at Trump\u2019s calls for schools to reopen \u201c<a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/trump-wants-schools-to-reopen-asap-americans-fear-they-wont-be-safe/ar-BB14y9HJ\">ASAP</a>\u201d, it seems as if that is exactly what\u2019s happening.

  "<p>These are bleak days for America\u2019s progressive movement. The Democratic primary process handed the party\u2019s nomination to the candidate with the most conservative record.

And a recession is battering the state and local budgets that fund progressive priorities like education and the social safety net.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/22/joe-biden-radicalism-fdr-economic-crisis-coronavirus\">Joe Biden pushed to embrace radicalism of FDR by scale of economic crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Perhaps this is a temporary stall-out \u2013 a fleeting moment of retreat in a two-steps-forward-one-step-back trajectory. After all, polls continue to show that from <a href=\"https://onlabor.org/new-poll-americans-see-big-power-imbalance-in-the-workplace/\">workers\u2019 rights</a> to <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/69-percent-americans-want-medicare-all-including-46-percent-republicans-new-poll-says-1500187\">universal healthcare</a>, a majority of Americans support a progressive policy agenda.</p> <p>The problem, though, is that Democrats in Washington are not just passively failing to mount a strong opposition to Donald Trump \u2013 they are actively helping Republicans try to fortify the obstacles to long-term progressive change well after this emergency subsides.</p> <p>This corporate counter-revolution is easiest to see in Democrats\u2019 enthusiastic support for Republicans\u2019 legislative response to the coronavirus crisis. Democrats\u2019 entire 2018 electoral campaign told America that the opposition party needed to win back Congress in order to block Trump\u2019s regressive agenda. And yet, when the Republicans proposed a bill to let Trump\u2019s appointees dole out government cash to their corporate allies with <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/shivaramrajgopal/2020/03/31/the-500-billion-in-corporate-assistance-will-end-up-as-a-corrupt-cash-grab-if-we-dont-ask-the-right-questions/#2969dfb55d4a\">no strings attached</a>, this same opposition party mustered <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/us/politics/coronavirus-house-voting.html\">not a single recorded vote</a> against the package. Not one.</p> <p>Thanks to that, Trump appointees and the Federal Reserve can now hand out <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/business/economy/fed-coronavirus-stimulus.html\">$4tn</a> to politically connected corporations as they lay waste to our economy and steamroll progressive reforms. <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/feds-coronavirus-stimulus-offers-taxpayer-cash-to-buyout-firm-companies-11586988495\">Private equity firms</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-15/-stealth-bailout-shovels-millions-of-dollars-to-oil-companies\">fossil fuel companies</a> get new tax breaks as they buy elections and try to lock in permanent climate change.</p> <p>These bailouts were part of a larger legislative package that included good things like expanded unemployment benefits \u2013 and so you could argue that Democrats simply had to swallow a bitter pill and vote yes. Except, they subsequently proposed their own standalone legislation that would further strengthen the corporate opponents of progressive reform.</p> <p>For example, there is the Democrats\u2019 push to alter the so-called paycheck protection program (PPP). Those loans were designed to help employees of mom-and-pop enterprises throughout the country. House Democrats\u2019 new stimulus legislation would open up the small business lending program to what they call \u201csmall nonprofits\u201d, but their language was crafted to provide the forgivable loans to industry trade associations. Those lobby groups represent the planet\u2019s biggest corporations \u2013 and their political action committees have delivered more than <a href=\"https://prospect.org/coronavirus/unsanitized-does-amazon-rip-off-the-postal-service/\">$191m of campaign cash</a> to lawmakers in the last two decades.</p> <p>Democrats have pitched their legislation as a \u201cmessage\u201d bill that declares their values \u2013 and in this case, they are reassuring Washington power-players that money meant for workers at neighborhood restaurants, local shops and other mom-and-pop concerns can be raided by the front groups representing giant drug companies, health insurers and Wall Street firms. If the legislation passes, it would not merely be an epic tale of greed \u2013 the new funding stream for corporate lobbying groups would bolster the very forces that make sure federal policy disempowers workers, maximizes private profit and generally protects the ruling class.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The tragedy is we\u2019re already moving in that wrong direction, and chances to change the dynamic don't come around often</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s an even worse story on healthcare. As <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/10/us-health-insurance-layoffs-coronavirus\">43 million Americans</a> face the prospect of losing private health insurance, Democrats had a huge opportunity. After Trump himself suggested he wanted the government to <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-administration-plans-to-pay-hospitals-to-treat-uninsured-coronavirus-patients-11585927877\">pay healthcare providers directly</a> for treating uninsured Covid-19 patients, they could have called his bluff and passed <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/3790/cosponsors?r=1&amp;s=1&amp;searchResultViewType=expanded&amp;KWICView=false\">existing legislation</a> to expand a Medicare program that provides actual medical care. Instead, House Democrats passed a bill to support lightly regulated private insurance marketplaces and to subsidize existing private insurance plans through a Rube Goldberg machine known as Cobra \u2013 and they passed this giveaway just after receiving an <a href=\"https://prospect.org/coronavirus/dems-health-insurer-bailout-follows-bundled-checks/\">infusion</a> of campaign cash collected by insurance lobbyists.</p> <p>Taken together, these initiatives would route yet more public money through a corporate insurance bureaucracy in hopes that medical care eventually trickles down to Americans who desperately need it. Such a system is totally inadequate during a pandemic: it doesn\u2019t guarantee healthcare \u2013 it only only guarantees insurance coverage, which is so often <a href=\"https://www.healthcaredive.com/news/aca-plans-denied-nearly-1-in-5-in-network-claims-in-2017/549312/\">denied</a> or restricted when a medical claim is actually filed. Moreover, corporate health insurance has far <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-costs-administration/more-than-a-third-of-u-s-healthcare-costs-go-to-bureaucracy-idUSKBN1Z5261\">higher administrative costs</a> than single-payer programs like <a href=\"https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20110920.013390/full/\">Medicare</a>, and even the much-vaunted Affordable Care Act allows insurers to siphon up to <a href=\"https://pnhp.org/news/why-medical-loss-ratio-rebates-benefit-the-insurers/\">20%</a> of customers\u2019 premiums to corporate profits rather than actual medical care.</p> <p>But then, Democrats\u2019 Cobra plan is not merely a financial bailout for insurers \u2013 it is also a political bailout when the industry needs it most. At a time when popular support for Medicare for All is <a href=\"https://morningconsult.com/2020/04/01/medicare-for-all-coronavirus-pandemic/\">surging</a> \u2013 when even a Republican president feels the need to make rhetorical (if empty) <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-administration-plans-to-pay-hospitals-to-treat-uninsured-coronavirus-patients-11585927877\">gestures</a> toward the concept of government-funded healthcare \u2013 the Cobra plan would use public money to firm up the private health insurance industry\u2019s dominance over the healthcare system, just in time to short circuit a Medicare expansion.</p> <p>That\u2019s probably why insurance companies have been <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/05/12/heroes-act-coronavirus-health-insurance-industry/\">lobbying for it</a>. They know that such a program would boost their short-term profits, and they know that once such a program is in place, it would be politically difficult to get it repealed and replaced by progressives\u2019 far better Medicare for All program. In other words: Democrats\u2019 Cobra plan may secure insurance companies\u2019 profit-skimming position between Americans and their healthcare providers for decades to come.</p> <p>If you get the sense that the fix is in and this is all deliberate, you\u2019re not wrong. Many of the self-styled <a href=\"https://front.moveon.org/progressives-mobilize-to-pass-heroes-act-house-covid-relief-bill/\">progressive advocacy groups</a> in Washington that posture as #resistance leaders turned a blind eye to the bill\u2019s problems and endorsed the legislation shortly after it was introduced, <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/05/15/coronavirus-relief-house-heroes-act-progressives/\">undercutting progressive lawmakers</a> off the bat.</p> <p>Making matters worse was the theater on the House floor. During the debate over the Democratic bill, nine progressive lawmakers made a <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/498034-progressives-to-buck-party-by-voting-against-3t-relief-bill\">public show</a> of <a href=\"http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2020/roll106.xml\">voting</a> against the procedural measure to advance the bill, along with a tiny group of moderates.

In a world in which multilateralism is sorely tested, Africa must stop expecting solutions from others. Africa should no longer be satisfied with this role of never-ending reservoir for some, and dumping ground for others.</p> \n   <p>There is an urgent need for Africa to chart its own course. Its food dependency and insecurity are unacceptable and intolerable, as is the state of its road, port, health and educational infrastructure. Africa\u2019s land, forests, rich fauna, mines, energy potential, and maritime and inland waterways, hold the necessary resources to provide an adequate response to the needs of its peoples.
