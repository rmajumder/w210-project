My first priority is and will always be the student-athletes and doing what is best for the program and the university.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Gundy has come under criticism since a Tuesday conference call with reporters where he said he hoped to have the team return to the on-campus football facilities on 1 May, in defiance of federal social-distancing guidelines. He said the the media has been overly negative in its coverage of what he called the \u201cChinese virus and added that if one of his players or coaches were to test positive after then, they would be \u201cquarantined just like we do people that get the flu\u201d.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe get people that get the flu during the season, we quarantine them, we treat them, we make sure they\u2019re healthy, we bring \u2018em back,\u201d Gundy said. \u201cIt would be the same thing here, but at some point, we\u2019ve got to go back to work. We\u2019ve got to get these guys back in here. ... From what I read, the healthy people can fight this, the antibodies make it better. They\u2019re doing some blood transplants now with the people that have already gotten the disease, that have gotten over it that have the antibodies that can fight it. There\u2019s a lot of people who can figure this out. May 1\u2019s our goal. Don\u2019t know if it will happen. Players will come in after that.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The remarks prompted a swift statement from the university, which said: \u201cWe will adhere to the advice of public health experts who are making informed decisions in the best interest of the citizens of our nation and state based on sound scientific data.\u201d</p> \n  <p>It\u2019s not the first time Gundy, whose annual salary is $5.13m, has whipped up controversy over his right-wing views. But USA Today\u2019s Dan Wolken made a salient point <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/columnist/dan-wolken/2020/04/07/oklahoma-state-coach-mike-gundy-coronavirus-comments/2966225001/\">in a Wednesday op-ed</a> that Gundy\u2019s political ideology is immaterial:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Hey, according to \u201cDr. Gundy,\u201d what\u2019s the harm in 18-, 19-, 20-, 21-year-olds possibly getting exposed to coronavirus? If they\u2019re healthy, it\u2019s all good, right? At any rate, we\u2019ve got to get moving, Gundy suggested, because paying salaries and \u201ccontinuing the economy in this state\u201d relies on the bodies of unpaid amateurs and people will \u201cfeel better\u201d watching football on TV.</p> \n   <p>Herd immunity, right? That\u2019s actually what Dr. Gundy was getting at. In fact, he referred to players as \u201cthe herd of healthy people\u201d who can fight the virus, even though that is, uh, not exactly the way any of this works. </p> \n   <p>None of this should be a surprise. Gundy has been edging toward the cliff of absurdity for a while now. In November 2018, he blamed \u201cliberalism\u201d for players transferring, saying \u201cI\u2019m a firm believer in the snowflake.\u201d He acknowledged Tuesday he\u2019s getting a lot of his information these days from the ultra-conservative One America News Network, an outlet he described as objective and non-political despite its history of pushing debunked right-wing conspiracy theories related to the murder of Seth Rich, and Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting survivor David Hogg.</p> \n   <p>But this isn\u2019t really about Gundy\u2019s political ideology or his sources of information. It\u2019s about him saying the quiet part out loud regarding how many college coaches view their players.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-11T22:17:48.787Z\">at 11.17pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e92312a8f08db3109f20e00\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-11T21:10:54.485Z\">10.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Arkansas senator Tom Cotton, who <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/17/business/media/coronavirus-tom-cotton-china.html\">floated a conspiracy theory</a> which said the Chinese government created Covid-19 in a weapons lab <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/11/republican-tom-cotton-coronavirus-china\">claimed on Saturday</a> that \u201ccommon sense has been my guide\u201d since he first learned of the outbreak in mid-January.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>\u201cNot Chinese communist lies.

  "<p>New York governor Andrew Cuomo and New York City mayor Bill de Blasio once again had differing opinions on who has authority to implement certain Covid-19 policies.</p> <p>This time, it involved De Blasio\u2019s announcement on Saturday morning that New York City\u2019s school district, which oversees 1.1 million students, would shutter for the rest of the academic year to try to slow the spread of the coronavirus. De Blasio said his administration was forging a \u201ccomprehensive plan\u201d to safely reopen schools in September and that \u201cnext year is going to have to be the greatest academic year New York public schools have ever had\u201d.</p> <p>De Blasio, like Cuomo a Democrat, said it was not an easy decision to close schools in favor of online learning, but that \u201cit is the right decision, and it\u2019s also a decision made a little clearer by the fact that the distance learning is working more and more every day\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/11/trump-states-governors-clashes\">Trump v the states: how the president is remaking the government in his image</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, at Cuomo\u2019s daily press briefing shortly afterwards, the governor insisted \u201cthere has been no decision on [closing New York City] schools\u201d and that the decision whether or not to close schools is \u201cis my legal authority in this situation\u201d.</p> <p>Cuomo added: \u201cWhen we made the decision to close the schools, we made it for the entire region. Any decision to reopen them will also be a coordinated decision.\u201d</p> <p>Cuomo was then pressed on the topic and De Blasio\u2019s earlier remarks. \u201cThat\u2019s his opinion. He didn\u2019t close them and he can\u2019t open them,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cIt happened on a metropolitan-wide basis and we\u2019ll act on a metropolitan basis, coordinating with Nassau, Suffolk and Westchester [counties].\u201d</p> <p>Adding to the confusion, an email from the city to parents was issued while Cuomo spoke, advising of the extended school closing. \u201cNYC school students will continue with remote learning for the rest of the 2019-20 school year,\u201d it said.</p> <p>Freddi Goldstein, De Blasio\u2019s press secretary, took issue with Cuomo\u2019s comments.</p> <p>She tweeted: \u201cThe governor\u2019s reaction to us keeping schools closed is reminiscent of how he reacted when the Mayor called for a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/20/new-york-90-day-stay-home-order-what-it-means\">shelter in place</a>. We were right then and we\u2019re right now. Schools will remain closed, just like how we eventually \u2013 days later \u2013 moved to a shelter in place model.\u201d</p> <p>Goldstein\u2019s tweet alluded to that fact that Saturday\u2019s dispute was the latest bout in a long-running grudge match between the two elected officials.</p> <p>When De Blasio said last month New York City residents should prepare for a \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d order, Cuomo said the city didn\u2019t have the power to make such a declaration. Days later, Cuomo announced a \u201cNew York state on pause\u201d order, directing non-essential businesses to close and telling people to stay 6ft away from others in public. The order sounded much like shelter-in-place, a term De Blasio has continued to use.</p> <p>School buildings in New York City, the center of the pandemic in the US, have been closed since 16 March. All school buildings in the state have been closed since 18 March following an executive order from Cuomo. The school closures were initially announced for a few weeks, back when the virus\u2019s full impact was not known. A massive effort to move school instruction online has met with mixed success in the city, where many low-income students lack wifi and devices for connecting to their virtual classrooms.</p> <p>Cuomo, whose national profile has risen during the pandemic, said again on Saturday he is not interested in running for president.</p> <p>When a reporter said some Democrats would prefer Cuomo to former vice president Joe Biden as their party\u2019s presidential nominee, Cuomo said: \u201cThat is on one hand flattering. On the other hand, it is irrelevant.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have no political agenda. Period,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not running for president. I\u2019m not running for vice president. I\u2019m not running anywhere. I\u2019m not going to Washington. I\u2019m staying right here.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 The caption to the picture was amended on 14 April 2020 because an earlier version said Andrew Cuomo was on the right. This has been corrected.</p>",

  "<p>More than two decades on, there\u2019s still something about what <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/08/linda-tripp-dies-aged-70-monica-lewinsky-bill-clinton\">Linda Tripp </a>did to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/monica-lewinsky\">Monica Lewinsky</a> that makes you gasp at the female-on-female betrayal and also makes you wonder whether this is the most painful kind of betrayal.</p> <p>Tripp has just died of cancer. When Lewinsky learned that Tripp was sick, she said: \u201cNo matter the past\u2026 I hope for her recovery. I can\u2019t imagine how difficult this is for her family.\u201d A graceful response and one in stark contrast to what Lewinsky said when the then US president Bill Clinton was impeached for lying about their affair: \u201cI\u2019m really sorry for everything that\u2019s happened. And I hate Linda Tripp.\u201d</p> <p>Her loathing for the older woman was understandable. Taken into Lewinsky\u2019s confidence about Clinton, Tripp secretly recorded the conversations (giving them to the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr) and encouraging the former White House intern to keep the semen-stained dress (for evidence). Even after relentless censure, ridicule and disgrace, Tripp continued to view herself as a righteous whistleblower. However, 22 hours of secretly taped conversations suggest something less edifying: one woman (naive, obsessed) spilling her secrets to another woman, who coolly gathered information, then used it to jam her young friend\u2019s head on to a spike.</p> <p>Too simplistic? Maybe. The truth is always more complicated. After all, it was Clinton who put the main wrecking ball through the lives of the three women involved: Monica, Hillary and Linda. The same Clinton <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/06/bill-clinton-monica-lewinsky-affair-anxiety\">who recently said</a> he\u2019d had the affair with Lewinsky to \u201cmanage his anxieties\u201d. (Do at least <em>try</em> to stay classy, Bill.)</p> <p>Women are also complicated \u2013 as human and fallible as any male betrayer. Certainly, women shouldn\u2019t be held to idealised standards of behaviour, which have a nasty habit of turning into bear traps anyway.</p> <p>Nevertheless, a woman betraying another woman so completely, in such an intentional strategic manner, is shocking and, in most female lifetimes, rare. While all betrayal is devastating, maybe because of entrenched sexism the female-on-female variety has an extra whiff of sulphur. It goes against the unspoken code, the feeling among women that ultimately we look out for each other, that it\u2019s them and us.</p> <p>It\u2019s the impulse that makes little girls pinky-promise their eternal devotion and teenagers keep secrets until they die. It\u2019s the young woman bursting into tears in the nightclub lavatory and finding herself comforted by a bunch of strangers who are her instant best friends. It\u2019s there behind workplace mentoring schemes. It\u2019s what makes younger women turn to older women for advice and older women feel proud to give it. And it\u2019s been there throughout #MeToo, with women giving testimonies and supporting each other, whatever the personal cost.</p> <p>Whatever was going on between Tripp and Lewinsky all those years ago, this crucial element \u2013 of instinctive warmth and trust between women \u2013 was missing, but only on one side. Lewinsky went to Tripp believing that the sisterhood exists; Tripp lied to her that it didn\u2019t.</p> <h2>No wonder amorous pandas dislike peeping toms</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d6e5fb5142848baf836136a1e2ac0c2f4aa6300a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d6e5fb5142848baf836136a1e2ac0c2f4aa6300a/85_292_2313_1388/1000.jpg\" alt=\"pandas Ying Ying and Le Le\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ying Ying and Le Le are finally getting it on after 13 years together.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ocean Park Hong Kong/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>How would you like to be gawped at while you\u2019re trying to have sex?

Whatever other problems pandas have with mating, what amounts to human-on-panda dogging has to stop. Clearly, pandas need a bit of privacy, the equivalent of Barry White playing on the turntable, perhaps a lava lamp on its lowest setting.

  "<p>A democratic socialist, Senator Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign amplified and projected ideas that radical grassroots organizers have been demanding for centuries in this country. His surrogates gave fiery, mesmerizing speeches at rallies that featured crowds larger than 25,000. Now, he has suspended his presidential campaign. This was his second run for the Oval Office.</p> <p>Sanders\u2019 political outsider savviness was his strength and weakness. He was sometimes criticized for not having specific plans for black people. I agree with a more nuanced version of this claim: Sanders did not demonstrate how he would prevent racism from impeding the universal programs that would help black people. While disappointing and warranted, his shortcoming mostly provided an easy cover for liberals to undermine his political ascension. Former vice-president Joe Biden authored a devastating crime bill that increased policing and mass incarceration, but that was smoothed away with his \u201cWe Know Joe\u201d slogan aimed at black communities. The California senator Kamala Harris laughed about threatening to prosecute poor black mothers for school absenteeism, but also made punchy race soundbites during debates that went viral. Even the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren\u2019s defense of capitalism and neoliberal ideas was obscured by her larger pronouncements to protect black women in hospitals and the workplace \u2013 bastions of capitalist exploitation. But Sanders\u2019 wise refusal to pander to black voters manifested in a perhaps unwise polar extreme: an unarticulated specific response to black plight.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/08/bernie-sanders-revolution-not-over\">Bernie Sanders\u2019 political revolution is not over | Bhaskar Sunkara</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When he flew to Michigan instead of where he was scheduled to speak in Jackson, Mississippi, headlines emerged that Sanders <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/05/us/politics/bernie-sanders-democratic-primary.html\">ceded the south </a>\u2013 meaning black voters \u2013 to Biden. He did not give a race speech in Detroit, but instead passed the microphone to black organizers to talk about their own issues. The day before his campaign suspension he talked about black voters, the coronavirus and the need for a targeted response in a virtual town hall.</p> <p>Nonetheless, Sanders had the most progressive presidential campaign in recent memory. By far, he had the enthusiasm and support of black people under 50, and was polling higher than Biden among black people as recently as <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/opinion/bernie-sanders-black-voters.html\">late February</a>. Free college and complete student debt cancellation could have decreased the wealth gap for all people, but for black students in particular because they disproportionately carry high debt loads. Medicare for All could have decreased future generations\u2019 prospects of facing pre-existing conditions and increased their health outcomes. Ending wars would have reduced the United States\u2019 militarism and slowed down the armed services from recruiting this country\u2019s poorest people. Vulnerable, dispossessed and oppressed communities in the United States and abroad would have experienced a significant improvement in their quality of life. Unhoused people would have entered homes and billionaires entered political homelessness. And when Biden went <a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2020/03/joe-biden-coronavirus-pandemic-presidential-campaign\">virtually absent</a> during the Covi-19 panic, Sanders shifted his campaign to a multimillion-dollar relief effort.</p> <p>Sanders\u2019 supporters now face a nearly impossible situation. For years, politicians and pundits asserted that Sanders is not a \u201creal Democrat\u201d. Those same critics now expect Sanders supporters to \u201cvote blue no matter who\u201d, regardless of being independent voters. If Biden loses to Donald Trump, then Sanders\u2019 supporters will be blamed for failing to fall in line. If Biden wins, the Democratic party will resist any transformational concessions to the party\u2019s left voters. We must not let them.</p> <p>If Sanders is right about losing the electability argument but winning the ideological one, then that\u2019s where his supporters must continue organizing if Biden wants their vote. Rather than \u201cvote blue no matter who\u201d, we must vote green for our planet, and brown and black for our people \u2013 and make demands on Biden that will fundamentally change this country. I do not expect Biden to become a socialist overnight, nor can he expect Sanders supporters to wake up neoliberal capitalists. Thus, Biden supporters should be putting pressure on <em>him</em> to change instead of threatening millions of other voters with a Trump card.</p> <p>As an alternative to using social media to express #NeverBiden, individual progressive voters might join or support coalitions that are using a collective and organized process to put pressure on the vice-president to agree to universal healthcare, a moratorium on deportations, and to overhaul his climate change plan.

  "<p>A proposed unity government deal involving Israel\u2019s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and opposition leader, Benny Gantz, appears to be in jeopardy as initial progress stalls and a deadline this week looks set to be missed.</p> <p>The pair \u2013 who have battled for more than a year in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/israels-opposition-head-benny-gantz-wins-support-to-form-government\">three inconclusive elections</a> \u2013 had both expressed a desire to come to an understanding as the country faces the coronavirus pandemic. Talks to join forces and end the crippling political deadlock appeared to be in the final stages. One power-sharing deal would see them rotate the role of leader over a four-year term.</p> <p>However, last week Gantz\u2019s party, Blue and White, said that, after an \u201call-round agreement\u201d had been reached, Netanyahu\u2019s Likud party suddenly resurrected old demands about judicial appointments. Likud countered that it was Gantz who backed away at the last minute.</p> <p>Gantz\u2019s deadline to form a coalition government will expire on Monday, though Israel\u2019s president, Reuven Rivlin, may allow him two extra weeks. The president could equally hand the mandate to Netanyahu, although, like Gantz, he does not have the seats to form a majority.</p> <p>Local media speculated that Netanyahu might have \u201ctorpedoed\u201d the negotiations after polls showed his party could win a possible fourth election, which will be held if the stalemate continues.</p> <p>Gantz took a significant risk last month when he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/benny-gantz-elected-israeli-speaker-signalling-deal-with-netanyahu\">went against senior members of his own party</a> to abort attempts to push through legislation to end Netanyahu\u2019s career in favour of restarting talks for a deal.</p> <p>Blue and White had threatened to introduce term-limits for prime ministers, and a ban on them serving while under indictment. Both scenarios would have ended Netanyahu\u2019s political career. He is Israel\u2019s longest-serving leader and is fighting three major corruption cases, including on charges of bribery and fraud. Netanyahu denies all the allegations.</p> <p>However, in a move that came as a surprise even to his allies, Gantz nominated himself and was elected speaker of parliament, apparently to shield Netanyahu from such bills.</p> <p>The plot twist cost Gantz more than half his Knesset members, who broke away, but the former head of the army argued that it was necessary to keep the possibility of a unity government alive.</p> <p>\u201cThese are unusual times and they call for unusual decisions. That\u2019s why I intend to explore the formation of a national emergency government,\u201d Gantz told the Knesset, Israel\u2019s parliament.</p> <p>Israeli commentators, however, have suggested that Gantz, who entered politics less than two years ago, may have been too optimistic about Netanyahu, famed as a political magician, agreeing to share the top seat.</p> <p>\u201cGantz is not at all built to deal with such phenomena,\u201d Yossi Verter <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/elections/.premium-as-gantz-s-time-runs-out-netanyahu-no-longer-in-a-rush-to-form-emergency-gov-t-1.8752546\">wrote</a> in Haaretz newspaper. \u201cIn his naivety, he decided in one quick moment to jump into bed with Netanyahu without guarantees \u2013 and in doing so he tore apart his party. He tried to play \u2018fair\u2019 against a competitor for whom such a principle arouses nothing but deep contempt.\u201d</p>",

Tsai has spearheaded a swift and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/04/asia/taiwan-coronavirus-response-who-intl-hnk/index.html\">successful defence</a> to the pandemic; despite Taiwan\u2019s proximity to mainland China it has largely contained the virus and has just under 400 confirmed cases. It is so well prepared that it is <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/04/09/taiwan-is-exporting-its-coronavirus-successes-to-the-world/\">donating 10</a><a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/04/09/taiwan-is-exporting-its-coronavirus-successes-to-the-world/\">m masks</a> to the US and 11 European countries.</p> <p>New Zealand, led by Jacinda Ardern, is also a world leader in combating the virus. The country has had only one <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/09/asia/new-zealand-lessons-intl-hnk/index.html\">Covid-19 death so far</a>. That\u2019s partly due to geography and size: with under 5 million people, New Zealand\u2019s entire population is much smaller than New York\u2019s. Being an island state also gives it a distinct advantage. However, leadership is also a factor. New Zealand has implemented widespread testing and Ardern has responded to the crisis with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/clarity-and-compassion-what-australia-can-learn-from-new-zealands-coronavirus-response\">clarity and compassion</a>.</p> <p>Germany has been hit hard by coronavirus, but it has an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/04/world/europe/germany-coronavirus-death-rate.html\">exceptionally low mortality rate of around 1.6%</a>. (Italy\u2019s fatality rate is 12%; Spain, France and Britain\u2019s is 10%; China\u2019s is 4%; America\u2019s is 3%.) A number of factors feed into Germany\u2019s low death rates, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/germany-low-coronavirus-mortality-rate-puzzles-experts\">early and widespread testing</a> and a large number of intensive care beds. Again, however, the country\u2019s leadership plays a role. As one wag on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mhdksafa/status/1246822725886320640?s=20\">joked</a>: if you\u2019re asking why death rates are so low in Germany and so high in America, it\u2019s \u201cbecause their president used to be a quantum chemist and your president used to be a reality television host\u201d. Angela Merkel, who has a doctorate in quantum chemistry, is actually the chancellor not the president, but the sentiment still holds.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/03/30/823912064/the-danish-way-is-working-prime-minister-hints-at-a-gradual-reopening-for-april\">Denmark</a> (led by prime minister Mette Frederiksen) and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/05/world/europe/coronavirus-finland-masks.html\">Finland</a> (prime minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/09/finland-anoints-sanna-martin-34-as-worlds-youngest-serving-prime-minister\">Sanna Marin</a> is the head of a coalition whose four other parties are all led by women) are also doing noteworthy jobs in containing coronavirus.</p> <p>Correlation is obviously not causation. Being a woman doesn\u2019t automatically make you better at handling a global pandemic. Nor does it automatically <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/dec/21/barack-obama-women-better-than-men-myths-leaders\">make you a better leader</a>; suggesting it does reinforces sexist and unhelpful ideas that women are innately more compassionate and cooperative.</p> <p>What is true, however, is that women generally have to be better in order to <em>become</em> leaders; we are held to far higher standards than men. Women are rarely able to fail up in the way men can; you have to be twice as good as a man in order to be taken half as seriously. You have to work twice as hard. With a few notable exceptions (*cough* Ivanka Trump *cough*), you\u2019ve got to be overqualified for a top job.</p> <p>A surplus of qualifications isn\u2019t exactly a problem Donald Trump has. America\u2019s response to the coronavirus crisis is arguably the worst in the world \u2013 although Britain also gets an honourable mention here. Instead of expertise, the Trump administration has led with ego. While thousands of Americans die, Trump <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/492084-trump-slams-wsj-for-failing-to-mention-ratings-in-critical-editorial\">tweets about his TV ratings</a>. Instead of cooperating, Trump is lashing out at the press and state leaders. It\u2019s hard to imagine Hillary Clinton responding to a crisis in this way without being immediately impeached. Which raises the question: are some men simply too emotional to be leaders?</p> <h2>Women using code words to escape domestic violence</h2> <p>There\u2019s been a huge spike in domestic violence around the world because of the Covid-19 lockdown. With help harder to access, people are finding creative workarounds.

  "<p>I\u2019m heading to the White House in the middle of a global pandemic \u2013 not a phrase I ever imagined writing when I was a schoolboy in Britain thinking about a career in journalism. Downtown Washington resembles a deserted film set these days, most of its famed monuments and museums closed. At the White House gates a white tent has been set up; a medical worker zaps me with a device that takes my temperature and gives me the all clear.</p> <p>After passing through security, I arrive at the West Wing briefing room, usually bustling like a railway station, but now sparsely populated by journalists, some wearing face masks.</p> <p>My temperature is taken again and I sit down, several seats apart from the other reporters. When Donald Trump and his team emerge stage right, they seem less worried than us about physical distancing (yet the US president has twice been tested, with negative results, for coronavirus).</p> <p>America has the greatest number of coronavirus cases in the world. It is a public health crisis, an economic crisis and \u2013 this is where we in Washington come in \u2013 a crisis of leadership. Trump, a property developer and reality TV star, was the first US president elected with no prior military or political experience. It was all a bit of a lark. Well, we\u2019re not laughing now. He is the man in charge of America in its biggest emergency since the second world war. And it seems that history\u2019s verdict will be unforgiving: he is not up to the job.</p> <p>I watch most of his daily coronavirus taskforce briefings, which sometimes run for more than two hours, from home (grateful for TV and steady broadband, though not always easy with two boisterous children) but get to go along about once a week <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cspan/status/1242234983516966912?s=20\">and ask questions.</a> Up close, the president\u2019s stature (he is 6ft 3in), blond mat of hair and peachy face afford a certain perverse charisma.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This is the closest any of us will get to the court of George III, with its mix of awesome power and terrifying capriciousness</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I was there one evening when, defying medical advice, Trump talked baldly about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/trumps-push-to-shorten-the-coronavirus-shutdown-proves-the-captain-is-flying-blind\">reopening the economy by Easter.</a> It was just a little scary, this realisation that the most powerful person in the world is unhinged \u2013 the closest any of us will get to the court of King George III with its mix of awesome power and terrifying capriciousness. Fortunately, on that occasion, Trump eventually bowed to the experts and kept the physical distancing guidelines in place until the end of April.</p> <p>It\u2019s also a presidential election year. Trump can no longer hold campaign rallies with big crowds. He has turned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/24/donald-trump-coronavirus-briefings-2020-campaign-rallies\">the daily briefings into a substitute,</a> still airing grievances, spinning untruths, bullying reporters and narcissistically promoting his favourite brand: himself. \u201cI have, you know, hundreds of millions of people,\u201d he mused on April Fools\u2019 Day. \u201cNumber one on Facebook. Did you know I was number one on Facebook? I mean, I just found out I\u2019m number one on Facebook. I thought that was very nice, for whatever it means.\u201d</p> <p>The wartime president Harry Truman kept a sign on his desk that said: <a href=\"https://www.trumanlibrary.gov/education/trivia/buck-stops-here-sign\">\u201cThe buck stops here.\u201d</a> Trump adheres to the opposite view. Having downplayed the virus for so long \u2013 \u201cWhen you have 15 people, and the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero, that\u2019s a pretty good job we\u2019ve done,\u201d he said on 26 February \u2013 and failed to prepare resources, he is now, extraordinarily, trying to sell a potential death toll of 100,000 Americans as a success. Even for this master of razzle-dazzle, it would be quite a magic trick.</p> <p>Typically, in times of national crisis, there is a default expectation that leaders will speak the truth, or mostly (let\u2019s not forget George W Bush\u2019s weapons of mass destruction). But with Trump that assumption no longer holds. His briefings would come with a government health warning were it not for the fact he is the government.</p> <p>Amid this confusing torrent of bluster, there are also medical experts dispensing genuine information, showing predictive models, urging people to maintain physical distancing, advising on the wearing of face masks. It therefore becomes an intensive exercise in trying to sift fact from fiction.</p> <p>American TV networks are having a lively debate about this. Should they show the broadcasts with a 30-second delay to allow fact-checking interventions? Should they show them at all? Increasingly, some are issuing disclaimers at the start and cutting away before the end.</p> <p>At the Guardian our rolling coverage of the briefings includes real-time fact-checking from a team of reporters. It is important not to allow Trump\u2019s baseless claims, for example his pushing of an unproven drug, to hang in the air unchallenged. Our reporting is determined to hold the powerful to account. What did the president know and when did he know it? And why didn\u2019t he act?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"155dbfdd144dcccf97364d2037d043681c5299c1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/155dbfdd144dcccf97364d2037d043681c5299c1/0_0_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A deserted street in Washington DC during the lockdown.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A deserted street in Washington DC during the lockdown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For example, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/28/trump-coronavirus-politics-us-health-disaster\">one article explored</a> how it could be that the first confirmed cases of Covid-19 were reported in South Korea and the US on the same day \u2013 20 January \u2013 yet one country took swift action to curb the outbreak while the other is still lurching towards catastrophe. Jeremy Konyndyk, who used to lead the government\u2019s response to international disasters at USAid, told the Guardian: \u201cWe are witnessing in the United States one of the greatest failures of basic governance and basic leadership in modern times.\u201d</p> <p>For a journalist, this most peculiar presidency already felt like the story of a lifetime. Now it has collided head-on with another story of a lifetime. But day by day, I am also witnessing the unfolding of an American tragedy. For three years, Trump thought he could define events.

How can I tell anyone whose parents were deported under the Obama administration that they support him? Do I think Biden is going to make my life better? No. I don\u2019t think he gives a shit. If you live in a swing state, you kind of have to vote for Joe Biden. The supreme court matters a lot. But my vote in California doesn\u2019t matter. And Joe Biden will be a bad president.

game day.</em></p> \n   <p><em>The NRL will implement strict biosecurity measures on the return to training next month, before the competition\u2019s planned resumption on 28 May.</em></p> \n   <p><em>Central to that will be the heath of its players. </em></p> \n   <p><em>The NRL must ensure it has minimised any risk to players, and guidelines off the field will be well beyond the government\u2019s public health measures.</em></p> \n   <p><em>Players can stay at home ... but could be asked to move if they live in a virus hotspot.</em></p> \n   <p><em>They will also be asked to self-isolate in the same manner that was floated before the competition was suspended. </em></p> \n   <p><em>\u201cThey can stay at home,\u201d V\u2019landys said.</em></p> \n   <p><em>\u201cAnd as

  "<p>Of all the things we\u2019ll miss about Bernie Sanders, now that he has dropped out of the Democratic race, his style should be the least of it. Not only because his politics are so right on \u2013 this is the man who believes in free education and Medicare for all and who has had many Americans, who until recently felt disenfranchised by mainstream politics, feeling activated by it. But also because his clothes are so seemingly unremarkable.</p> <p>He wears crumpled suits that look borrowed from a slightly larger man and creased shirts with straight-lace striped ties. The inconspicuousness of his geography teacher shoes are matched only by his inoffensive navy round-neck jumpers.</p> <p>Yet this is also a man who in 2017 received fashion\u2019s equivalent of a knighthood when his logo was riffed on by the one of the biggest names in fashion, the Balenciaga designer Demna Gvasalia, for his autumn/winter 2017 menswear collection.</p> <p>He has been the subject of high-fashion meme treatment thanks to <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/siduations/?hl=en\">Siduations</a>, an Instagram account that first had the industry tickled back in 2017, and his merch, emblazoned with his name and likeness, has been regularly spotted on influencers with Instagram accounts boasting 20 million-plus followers.</p> <p>Rarely has a politician been so loved by the fashion world, and so vocal in his \u2013 at best \u2013 ambivalence towards all things fashion.

While Fox News reporters did cover it, some opinion hosts rhymed with Trump in comparing it to flu and accusing liberals of whipping up hysteria.

Four in five Fox News viewers surveyed by Pew Research said they believed the media had exaggerated the risks of the virus. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/09/rupert-murdoch-open-letter-journalists-coronavirus-fox-news\">An open letter</a> to Fox Corporation\u2019s chairman, Rupert Murdoch, and chief executive, Lachlan Murdoch, signed by 74 journalism professors and leading journalists, described Fox News misinformation as \u201ca danger to public health\u201d.</p> <p>It argued: \u201cAs the virus spread across the world, Fox News hosts and guests minimized the dangers, accusing Democrats and the media of inflating the dangers (in Sean Hannity\u2019s words) to \u2018bludgeon Trump with this new hoax\u2019. Such commentary encouraged Donald Trump to trivialize the threat and helped obstruct national, state and local efforts to limit the coronavirus.\u201d</p> <p>Hannity was unrepentant. <a href=\"[https://www.newsweek.com/sean-hannity-defends-fox-news-after-journalism-professors-publish-critical-letter-about-coronavirus-1495880\">He told Newsweek:</a> \u201cGo to my website and you\u2019ll see irrefutable evidence that I have taken this seriously way before most in the media did. I warned in January that it was dangerous because it was highly contagious, but some people were asymptomatic, so it would spread quickly.\u201d</p> <p>Some of the Trump old guard, such as Steve Bannon and Tucker Carlson, were quicker to recognise the virus could not be wished away. On 7 March Carlson <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/carlson-felt-obligation-meet-trump-virus-69675590\">delivered a warning in person</a> to Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. On 9 March he told Fox News viewers: \u201cPeople you trust, people you probably voted for, have spent weeks minimising what is clearly a very serious problem.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just partisan politics, they say: \u2018Calm down. In the end, this is just like the flu and people die from that every year. Coronavirus will pass, and when it does, we will feel foolish for worrying about it.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s their position. But they\u2019re wrong.\u201d</p> <p>On 13 March Trump declared a national emergency, and soon after called himself a \u201cwartime president\u201d. Hannity and others fell into line, denying they had ever <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mmfa/status/1248677919364460545?s=20\">sought to downplay the virus.</a></p> <h2>\u2018Major responsibility\u2019</h2> <p><a href=\"https://view2.fdu.edu/academics/becton-college/social-sciences-and-history/faculty/dan-cassino/\">Dan Cassino,</a> a political scientist at Fairleigh Dickinson University and author of Fox News and American Politics: How One Channel Shapes American Politics and Society, said: \u201cSome of the primetime shows have been better at shaping [Trump] than others.

Tucker Carlson has been more effective on pushing him into certain positions.

The place of Lincoln, and books about him, in a nation jaggedly divided again.</p> <p>Lincoln\u2019s life, Widmer says, \u201cis a story of incredible survival against adversity. And more than survival, really, sort of winning on every possible front. And whenever we fail again, which we do pretty routinely, I think he still speaks to us and helps us to be better than we might be otherwise.\u201d</p> <p>You may see where this is heading. Covid-19 is ravaging the land and to some Lincoln\u2019s successor in the White House, the 45th president, seems to be losing the fight.</p> <p>I ask the inevitable question, prompted by interviews with historians of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/08/sidney-blumenthal-lincoln-politics-trump-republicans\">Lincoln</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/oct/28/david-blight-on-frederick-douglass-i-call-him-beautifully-human\">Frederick Douglass</a> but also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/nov/20/where-memory-leads-saul-friedlander-holocaust-history-trump\">the Holocaust</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/09/sarah-bakewell-at-the-existentialist-cafe-book-interview\">Jean-Paul Sartre</a>.

While writing this book I was conscious of how much I learned from my Republican grandmother.</p> <p>\u201cI think Lincoln\u2019s example shows how important it is to be an ethical person, which he was, very unusually for politicians in his own time as well as ours. He was uncomfortable talking about himself and he tried to give the credit to others.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He tried to say to Americans, 'It\u2019s really important to get democracy right'</p> <footer> <cite>Ted Widmer</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cBut he also had a long view. He tried to say to Americans, \u2018It\u2019s really important to get democracy right, because so many other people are depending on us, not just people in this country, with and without political rights, but other countries who are trying to become more democratic.\u2019</p> <p>\u201c\u2026 And he was thinking a lot about the future too. He mentions the 20th century in a few speeches. And so I think he was trying to reach out to us. And I think we should not be ashamed about looking back to him.</p> <p>\u201cHow can we be the most ethical people? How can we choose the wisest leaders? How can we get back to factuality?

So I argue that he really had worked out something very important.\u201d</p> <p>Widmer started out aiming simply to portray \u201cLincoln moving in a fast-moving conveyance, a train, in a very dangerous situation\u201d. It \u201cfelt cinematic\u201d, he says, and indeed it does, as the places Lincoln saw \u2013 Indianapolis, Cincinnati, Baltimore and its nests of would-be assassins \u2013 slide past.</p> <p>But then he \u201crealised Lincoln was changing in important ways along the way and Philadelphia\u2019s the key to that. He\u2019s giving better and better speeches, though there were a couple clunkers, and I like that because it shows a human Lincoln.</p> <p>\u201cHe gave a very bad speech about the economy in Pittsburgh and he nearly lost his inaugural speech in Indianapolis. He had a lot of problems. But then he starts about what it means to be an American.\u201d</p> <p>Around Lincoln\u2019s odyssey, quoting Homer liberally, Widmer wraps a richly written account of the concurrent journey of the Confederate president, Jefferson Davis; diversions on train-travel in the 19th century (Widmer is a passionate defender of 21st-century Amtrak); and portrayals of those who Lincoln met, who recorded their thoughts in diaries, letters and long-lost local papers.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When Americans are being whipsawed by the news \u2026 Lincoln gives an absolutely beautiful speech on Washington's birthday</p> <footer> <cite>Ted Widmer</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There is also \u201ca lot about the building, Independence Hall, and what a difficult history it had\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cAt a time when Americans are being whipsawed by the news, Lincoln goes into the most sacred building of American political history, where the Declaration of Independence was written and signed, and he gives an absolutely beautiful speech on George Washington\u2019s birthday about how this is the document that has guided him throughout everything he\u2019s ever done in politics.</p> <p>\u201cBut in fact, [the hall] had been used as a holding pen for African Americans in the 1850s who were being recaptured.

Globally women represent more than 70 per cent of all health care workers and in the home, women are predominantly the carers of the elderly, people with disabilities and children.

From the letter:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>\u201cLaunch a nationwide public service campaign to educate consumers about common scams targeting the economically vulnerable. Over the next several weeks, most consumers will receive checks of $1,200 or more because of the recently enacted Cares Act. Scammers are already defrauding consumers by claiming they can expedite the receipt of these funds. The FTC and IRS should dramatically increase their efforts to educate consumers about these scams, and the Department of Justice should prioritize investigation and prosecution of the criminals behind them.\u201d</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-10T20:45:33.561Z\">at 9.45pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e90d2758f081a236f1916c5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/mario-koran\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-10T20:09:50.220Z\">9.09pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>About 74 miles of city streets <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/10/oakland-california-slow-streets-coronavirus-us\">will be blocked off</a> for joggers and bikers to enjoy for Easter weekend after Libby Schaaf, the mayor of Oakland, California, announced a \u201cslow streets initiative\u201d.</p> \n  <p>The move will give residents a way to get outdoors at a time when the record number of visitors who flocked to beaches and parks prompted officials to close popular recreational spots. </p> \n  <p>\u201cBecause of the reduction in car traffic, we will be closing off a number of streets so that bicyclists and pedestrians can spread out and take in fresh air safely on Oakland streets, free of cars,\u201d Schaaf said Thursday.

The weekend long curfew, the first of its kind within the United States geographical borders, will be enforced by tribal police, who have been authorized to sanction violators with a fine of up to $1000 and/or 30 days in jail. Essential workers such as medical staff are exempt, but must carry a letter from their employer. </p> \n  <p>On Thursday, Navajo president <strong>Jonathan Nez</strong> and vice-president <strong>Myron Lizer</strong>, announced that they were going into self-quarantine after recently coming into contact with a first responder who later tested positive for the virus. \u201cThis is real and no-one is immune from contracting the virus. We will continue to fight for our people as we self-quarantine - this is a precautionary measure,\u201d said Nez during an online town hall meeting. </p> \n  <p>The Navajo government was quick to implement prevention and mitigation measures after reporting its first case on 17 March, in an effort to minimize spread through its vast territory which stretches over parts of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. This included issuing a stay at home order just two days after California, followed by an 8pm to 5am curfew. But, the virus is spreading rapidly with 558 confirmed cases including 20 deaths as of Thursday 9 April. </p> \n  <p>Last month, the US federal government approved $8bn for native communities and tribal services in its third coronavirus rescue package, but tribal leaders fear that they won\u2019t see the money until summer due to red tape and paperwork.
