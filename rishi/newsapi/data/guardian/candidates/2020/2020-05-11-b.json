The warning comes after Germany reported an acceleration in new infections after easing its lockdown, and South Korea, another country that succeeded in limiting infections, saw a new outbreak in nightclubs.</li> \n   <li><strong>Boris Johnson, the UK prime minister, denied reports his senior scientific and medical advisers were not consulted on the much-maligned new messaging attached to <strong>his plan </strong></strong>to ease the country\u2019s lockdown as he set out the details in parliament. Amid muddled guidance from ministers on what the new rules actually allow, Johnson insists the public understands his government\u2019s message.</li> \n   <li><strong>Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, announced an easing of the nationwide lockdown</strong>, even as the country reported a record number of new infections. Putin said people in some sectors would return to work, though restrictions on public gatherings would remain in place. </li> \n   <li><strong>Men\u2019s blood has higher levels of an enzyme used by the Sars-CoV-2 virus to infect cells</strong>, the results of a study published in the European Heart Journal show.

It is thought to play a role in how the infection progresses into the lungs.</li> \n   <li><strong>The Afghan capital, Kabul, recorded its worst day for infections, as 161 new cases were reported,</strong> and the health ministry warned transmission would continue to surge across the country.

the virus takes off again,\u201d he said. </p> \n  <p> Governments around the world are struggling with the question of how to reopen their economies while still containing Covid-19. </p> \n  <p>The WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, told the same briefing that lifting restrictions was \u201ccomplex and difficult\u201d and that the \u201cslow, steady lifting of lockdowns\u201d was

Twenty-two people have died and 378 have recovered from the virus. </p> \n  <p>On Saturday there were almost a thousand new cases announced by the government. The rate of infections has fuelled worries that the relaxed measures have caused the virus to spread further. In what is still technically an election year, criticism of the government has grown more intense.</p> \n  <p>The former president John Mahama, a candidate against Akufo-Addo\u2019s re-election, tweeted on Saturday: \u201cFrom 3,091 to 4,012 #COVID19 cases within 24 hours. Government is certainly failing the people of Ghana.\u201d</p> \n  <p>In the president\u2019s address the following day, he indirectly responded: \u201cI know some political actors would want you to believe that the new numbers represent a failure on our part, do not begrudge them.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The government insists that its fairly robust testing and tracing measures allow it to track the spread with precision and focus restrictions on specific locations rather than entire cities. So far 160,000 tests have been administered in Ghana, one of the highest totals in Africa. </p> \n  <p>Addo said a sharp rise in cases was partly due to a backlog of tests, which had now been cleared. Many recently confirmed cases were not new infections. Clusters of cases were being tightly traced, such as 533 infections at a fish processing factory which he said were all linked to one individual. </p> \n  <p>Health officials in Ghana feel the larger case numbers, among the highest in Africa, are largely a result of its more comprehensive and widespread testing campaign relative to other countries.

According to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, the state has recorded 335,395 coronavirus cases and 26,641 deaths, about a third of all fatalities in the US.</p> <p>But Monday also brought <a href=\"https://apnews.com/9220c34f63461b56aeb06cc7645a91ae\">news</a> of a potentially dramatic undercount of deaths in New York City. According to an analysis by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), between mid-March and early May, about 24,000 more people died in the city than researchers would ordinarily expect, based on the season.</p> <p>That was about 5,300 more deaths that had been attributed to the coronavirus during that period. At his own press conference on Monday, Mayor Bill de Blasio said that \u201cunless something miraculous happens\u201d, lockdown measures were \u201cgoing into June\u201d.</p> <p>The outbreak has been less severe in smaller cities and rural areas and Cuomo said three upstate regions had met all criteria for opening some business activity after 15 May: the Southern Tier, Mohawk Valley and the Finger Lakes.</p> <p>Other upstate regions could follow soon, Cuomo said, though the reopening regions still needed to work out logistics such as creating regional \u201ccontrol rooms\u201d to monitor the effects of reopening.</p> <p>Cuomo said the reopening would happen in four phases. The first businesses able to open would include construction, manufacturing and retail with curbside pickup. Additionally, landscaping and gardening businesses and drive-in theaters would be able to open statewide, the governor said, adding that the state was also relaxing restrictions on low-risk outdoor activities such as tennis.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the next big step in this historic journey,\u201d Cuomo said, adding that \u201call the arrows are pointed in the right directions\u201d and noting that hospitalizations were also in decline.</p> <p>The state is recording about 488 new infections per day, he said, which is \u201cright about where we started before we went into the heart of this crisis\u201d.</p> <p>There had been 161 new deaths in New York in the previous 24 hours.</p> <p>Cuomo said there were now 93 cases of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/10/new-york-mystery-coronavirus-illness-three-children-die\">a mysterious illness</a> with symptoms similar to Kawasaki disease that affects children and is believed to be related to Covid-19.

  "<p>John Oliver has criticised Donald Trump over his attack on the US postal service (USPS) as the self-funded organisation is on the verge of collapse.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/may/04/john-oliver-jared-kushner-coronavirus\">John Oliver to Jared Kushner: 'If it's a success story for anyone, it\u2019s for the coronavirus'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Last Week Tonight host dedicated his latest at-home show to the USPS which is currently at risk, along with its staff. He showed footage of postal workers who were scared to come to work, to which Oliver added: \u201cThose fears are not misplaced.\u201d More than 1,000 have tested positive for the coronavirus while at least 40 have died.</p> <p>The USPS is in desperate need of financial aid, having asked for $89bn from Congress, a problem that has come \u201cat the worst possible time\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoL8g0W9gAQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IoL8g0W9gAQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Oliver explained how most of its problems are related to a 2006 law known as the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act. It requires the USPS to pre-pay healthcare benefits for retirees on a 50-year schedule which equates to $5bn a year for 10 years, an \u201caggressive obligation\u201d which has been crippling.</p> <p>The law also put price caps on things like first-class mail so as they have been losing money, they haven\u2019t been able to make any more. \u201cIn hindsight it seems like a pretty clear death sentence,\u201d Oliver said.</p> <p>It meant that a $900m profit in 2006 has turned into a $3.8bn loss in 2009. Conservative detractors have claimed that privatising the postal service would be a solution but this would mean there would be no requirement to deliver to remote addresses and while email has been touted as a replacement, Oliver reminded his audience that 42 million Americans don\u2019t have access to internet.</p> <p>The USPS also delivered 1.2bn prescriptions in 2019 and if it was eradicated and then modified by the government then \u201csmall businesses would be immediately affected\u201d.</p> <p>Trump has \u201cstrongly opposed giving it financial aid\u201d by openly criticising the USPS for working with Amazon to help deliver their parcels. Amazon is of course owned by one of the president\u2019s many nemeses, Jeff Bezos, who owns the Washington Post, a paper that has run many factually accurate stories about Trump\u2019s many mishaps.</p> <p>Oliver joked that Trump \u201cmakes policy decisions based on his never-ending game of six degrees of how is this about me\u201d before showing footage of him calling it a joke and saying they should increase pricing.</p> <p>In response, Oliver said that \u201cthe postal service is not a joke\u201d and also \u201cif the postal service quadruples prices on companies, the package delivery costs will almost certainly be passed on to the consumer because the companies, they don\u2019t give a shit\u201d.</p> <p>He continued: \u201cTrump is absolutely convinced that the postal service\u2019s biggest problem is one of the few things that\u2019s not one of its problems\u201d before reminding us that \u201ctheir hands are tied when it comes to pricing on their main products\u201d.</p> <p>Oliver also joked that if the government was in charge then \u201cby next year every stamp in America will contain one of Jeff Bezos\u2019s dick pics\u201d.</p> <p>He added: \u201cIt is so important that they are given more flexibility, not just on pricing but also on the types of services they can offer.\u201d</p> <p>One of the suggestions is postal banking, which would provide very basic financial services that would be profitable and would help the 25% of people living in unbanked or underbanked communities.</p> <p>He continued: \u201cWhat they badly need is an infusion of funding as soon as possible and not only should we be demanding they get that, Congress should also take a look at undoing some of the more onerous terms in that 2006 law.\u201d</p> <p>Oliver has also released a line of stamps given that they are \u201cstill a key revenue generator\u201d which viewers can buy online.</p>",

  "<p>Sunday\u2019s presidential election in Poland had a record low turnout of 0%.</p> <p>The vote was not officially cancelled but polling stations stayed closed, leading to a strange ghost election after weeks of legal wrangling over whether or not it should go ahead.</p> <p>The ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party, which has been accused of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/12/poland-march-judges-europe-protest-lawyers\">rolling back democratic norms</a> in recent years, tried to hold the election despite the challenges of voting in times of Covid-19.</p> <p>The PiS-allied incumbent, Andrzej Duda, was the firm favourite to win, and the opposition accused the government of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/01/polish-government-still-planning-to-hold-presidential-election\">trying to push through the vote now</a> to make it easier for him to win in the first round. Up until Wednesday evening, the government insisted a postal vote would go ahead.</p> <p>\u201cThe polling station is closed, which means someone cancelled the election. But it\u2019s unclear who did or on what basis,\u201d said Tomasz Trela, a leftist MP, after turning up at a school that usually functions as a polling station on Sunday.</p> <p>Opposition candidates believe Duda might have been more vulnerable in a later election, when the economic fallout of coronavirus restrictions is more apparent, and also complained that restrictions on movement meant campaigning was impossible.</p> <p>They wanted the government to declare a state of emergency or a state of natural disaster, both of which would have automatically postponed the election, but the government, which is informally controlled by the PiS party leader, Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski, refused to do so, saying the coronavirus situation was not serious enough to warrant it. The decision opened up a rift in the ruling coalition between PiS and one of its smaller governing partners.</p> <p>Poland, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/05/why-has-eastern-europe-suffered-less-from-coronavirus-than-the-west\">like most central European countries</a>, has kept its coronavirus figures lower than western neighbours, partly through an early lockdown that is now being gradually eased. So far there have been about 16,000 confirmed cases and 800 deaths in the country, which has a population of 38 million.</p> <p>The run-up to the election was chaotic, with ballots printed before there was a legal basis for holding a postal election, and no clarity on whether hundreds of thousands of Poles abroad would be able to vote. Until a few days before, it was unclear whether the vote would proceed.</p> <p>\u201cIt turns out that reality is not as flexible as Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski\u2019s mind,\u201d said Szymon Ho\u0142ownia, one of the opposition candidates, in a press conference on Monday.</p> <p>The national electoral commission set a deadline of two weeks to fix the date of a new election, which should be within 60 days of the announcement. There is likely to be continued wrangling over the legal basis for changing the election date, and over whether the new election will be conducted entirely by post or will feature voting in person.</p> <p>The head of the electoral commission, Sylwester Marciniak, said he hoped for a breakthrough that would allow for a vote that would be \u201cfully democratic, transparent and fair\u201d.</p>",

The Natural Resources Defense Council has sued 110 times and says it has prevailed in about 90% of lawsuits resolved.</p> <p>Recently, judges tossed out a permit for the Keystone XL oil sands pipeline and decided the EPA cannot bar scientists who receive federal grants from serving as agency advisers.</p> <p>Jeff Holmstead, a lawyer with the firm Bracewell who represents regulated industries and was a deputy EPA administrator under George W Bush, argued that many of the changes characterized as \u201crollbacks\u201d are actually \u201csensible, reasonable regulatory reforms\u201d or fixes to problems.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to understand the Trump administration\u2019s EPA unless you go back and look at the Obama administration,\u201d he said. \u201cIn many groups there was a sense that there really had been a great deal of regulatory overreach. And even if you disagree with that, the regulatory programs created problems that they didn\u2019t come back and fix.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018This is about who we\u2019re protecting\u2019</h2> <p>Trump\u2019s deregulatory agenda has addressed some issues industry would rather were left alone. The agency is changing the way it calculates the benefits of mercury controls for power plants. Companies had already complied with the rule and most didn\u2019t want it changed. But the revision is meant to set a precedent for the government to ignore some positive health outcomes of regulation.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s weakened standards often go against science too, critics say.</p> <p>Last month, for example, the EPA decided not to tighten rules for soot pollution, refuting rebutting guidance from experts that more stringent standards would save lives. The EPA has also repopulated advisory boards with representatives from industry and conservative states and is trying to change what science it can consider when developing health protections.</p> <p>If a Democrat takes the White House, it will take years to reverse some changes. Moving faster would require Democrats holding both chambers of Congress. Even then, industry would fight hard.</p> <p>Christopher Cook, the environment chief for Boston, said Trump\u2019s efforts had been \u201cincongruous with all the actions that major cities are taking\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe thing I would ask most Americans to consider when they\u2019re supporting stronger regulation is that this isn\u2019t about what we\u2019re protecting against, this is about who we\u2019re protecting,\u201d Cook said, noting that places with more pollution are faring worse under the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cCovid has been a dry run for the climate crisis. We\u2019ve seen the populations that Covid affects because it attacks the respiratory system. We can\u2019t continue with bad air in America.\u201d</p>",

Bars, restaurants, theatres and cinemas remain closed. Primary schools will take small numbers of pupils, depending on space. Masks will be obligatory on public transport. Everyone will be able to move outside without having to present a form on demand but people will only be able to go 100 kilometres from their place of residence.</li> \n   <li><strong>Belgium:</strong> Most businesses will open Monday, with social distancing. Masks are recommended. Cafes, restaurants and bars remain closed. In central Brussels there will be speed limits on cars and priority will be given to cyclists and pedestrians. Schools remain closed until 18 May.</li> \n   <li><strong>Britain</strong>: People will be actively encouraged to return to work from this week if they cannot work from home. Unlimited outdoor exercise will be allowed from Wednesday. From 1 June (at the earliest) nurseries and primary schools may reopen, and some non-essential shops. By July, at least some of the hospitality industry and other public places could be reopened.</li> \n   <li><strong>The Netherlands: </strong>Primary schools will partially reopen Monday. Driving schools, hair salons, physiotherapists and libraries also return, with social distancing measures.</li> \n   <li><strong>Switzerland: </strong>Primary and middle schools will reopen Monday, with classes often reduced in size. Restaurants, museums and bookshops will also open, with conditions. Meetings of more than five people remain banned.</li> \n   <li><strong>Spain</strong>: Half of Spain\u2019s 47 million people will be able to meet with family or friends in gatherings of up to 10 as of Monday. Outdoor spaces at bars and restaurants can reopen with limited capacity. Hardest-hit Madrid and Barcelona are excluded from the easing, though football clubs FC Barcelona resumed training on Friday and Real Madrid will follow Monday. Only movements within provinces are authorised and cinemas and theatres remain closed. Schools will not start up again until September.</li> \n   <li><strong>Italy</strong>: While schools remain closed until September, factories, building sites and offices reopened on 4 May. Social distancing rules are in place in parks. Wearing masks is mandatory on public transport. All retail businesses will reopen on 18 May, as will museums, cultural sites, churches and libraries. Bars and restaurants will reopen from 1 June, along with hair and beauty salons.</li> \n   <li><strong>Germany</strong>: Eating in restaurants is now possible in the north-eastern state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, where the country\u2019s first cafes and restaurants reopened on Saturday. Under Germany\u2019s federal system, each of the 16 states makes its own decisions on how to emerge from lockdown and cafes and restaurants will reopen in a number of other states in the coming days and weeks. Most shops are already open and children are slowly returning to classrooms. Bundesliga football matches are also set to resume.

Discrimination against us just because we are medical workers is discouraging and demoralizing.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The backlash against coronavirus patients may lead some who fall sick to avoid seeking medical care, raising the risks of infection spreading further, clinical psychologist Reo Morimitsu at the Suwa Red Cross Hospital said in an interview with NHK public television. Reports said Japanese police last month found about a dozen people dead at home alone or collapsed on the streets who later tested positive for the virus. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThe virus not only infects our body but also our minds and behaviour, harming us and dividing our society,\u201d Morimitsu said.</p> \n  <p>Random acts of hatred against those with virus connections have been reported countrywide, prompting Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and other officials to speak out.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s shameful,\u201d Abe told a recent parliamentary session. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-10T04:24:37.488Z\">at 5.24am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb765258f08c0a2409bae0a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-10T02:29:58.317Z\">3.29am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Sam Neill, Jurassic Park actor, shares his advice for combating anxiety</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Sam Neill, the New Zealand actor famous for roles in<em> Jurassic Park</em> and<em> Hunt for the Wilderpeople</em> has kept busy during lockdown filming short videos designed to cheer his followers up.
