  "<p>Joe Biden has apologised for saying that if African Americans \u201chave a problem figuring out whether you\u2019re for me or Trump, then you ain\u2019t black\u201d, a remark which prompted a storm of controversy and fierce attacks from supporters of the president.</p> <p>\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have been such a wise guy,\u201d Biden said on a call with the US Black Chambers, an African-American business group, which was added to his public schedule. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have been so cavalier.\u201d</p> <p>Biden also said he would never \u201ctake the African American community for granted\u201d.</p> <p>The former vice-president made the offending remark in an interview with Charlamagne tha God, a co-host of the radio show The Breakfast Club.</p> <p>After Biden had been pressed on issues including the legalization of marijuana and his choice of running mate, a campaign aide interjected to say he had to wrap it up, prompting the host to say: \u201cYou can\u2019t do that to black media.\u201d</p> <p>Saying \u201cI do that to black media and white media\u201d, Biden said his wife needed to use his studio.</p> <p>Charlamagne said: \u201cListen, you\u2019ve got to come see us when you come to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/new-york\">New York</a>, VP Biden. It\u2019s a long way until November. We\u2019ve got more questions.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ve got more questions?\u201d Biden said. \u201cWell I tell you what, if you have a problem figuring out whether you\u2019re for me or Trump, then you ain\u2019t black.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt don\u2019t have nothing to do with Trump,\u201d the host said. \u201cIt has to do with the fact [that] I want something for my community.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cTake a look at my record, man!\u201d Biden said, before claiming his record as a senator and vice-president was \u201csecond to none\u201d.</p> <p>Biden has been criticized and attacked for previous positions and comments on race, such as when he reminisced about past \u201ccivility\u201d in the Senate by recalling his work with two senators who opposed racial integration.</p> <p>His comment about black voters and Trump prompted fierce and instant backlash.</p> <p>The South Carolina senator Tim Scott, the only black Republican in the upper chamber, tweeted: \u201c1.3 million black Americans already voted for Trump in 2016. This morning, Joe Biden told every single one of us we \u2018ain\u2019t black\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Katrina Pierson, who leads the Black Voices for Trump advisory board, said: \u201cToday he once again proved what a growing number of black Americans and I have always known: Joe Biden does not deserve our votes.\u201d</p> <p>Scott and Pierson featured on a press call quickly convened by the Trump campaign, in which Pierson reportedly grew defensive when pressed on Trump\u2019s own lengthy history of racially insensitive comments.</p> <p>Trump himself retweeted Scott\u2019s view that Biden\u2019s comments \u201care the most arrogant and condescending thing I\u2019ve heard in a very long time\u201d and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1263928148283887616\">commended</a> an African American Fox News host, Harris Faulkner, as \u201cA GREAT AMERICAN\u201d.</p> <p>Faulkner said Biden\u2019s comment was \u201cmore than just a little offensive, it is short-sighted, it is a blind spot for this former vice-president\u201d.</p> <p>Before Biden\u2019s apology, Symone Sanders, a senior adviser who is African American, said the comment was \u201cmade in jest\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cLet\u2019s be clear about what the VP was saying,\u201d Sanders tweeted. \u201cHe was making the distinction that he would put his record with the African American community up against Trump\u2019s any day. Period.\u201d\ufeff\ufeff</p> <p>Biden has committed to picking a woman as his running mate and two leading contenders, Kamala Harris and Stacey Abrams, are black. Near the end of his interview on Friday, however, he was pressed on reports that he is considering Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar, who is white.</p> <p>Black voters \u201csaved your political life in the primaries\u201d, Charlamagne said, referring to Biden\u2019s comeback from early defeats with a big win in South Carolina, and adding that such voters \u201chave things they want from you\u201d.</p> <p>Biden said: \u201cI guarantee you there are multiple black women being considered. Multiple.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The lawyer representing Tara Reade, who has accused Joe Biden of sexual assault, said on Friday he was dropping her as a client although he continued to believe in the truth of her allegations.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/22/coronavirus-us-live-trump-holiday-weekend-latest-news-updates\">Coronavirus US live: Trump demands churches, synagogues and mosques reopen 'right now'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cOur decision \u2026 is by no means a reflection on whether then Senator Biden sexually assaulted Ms Reade,\u201d Douglas Wigdor said in a statement. \u201cOn that point, our view \u2013 which is the same view held by the majority of Americans, according to a Harvard CAPS-Harris Poll \u2013 has not changed.\u201d</p> <p>Reade is a former staffer from Biden\u2019s office when he was a senator from Delaware. She alleges that he pushed her against a wall in the Senate buildings and assaulted her. Biden has denied the accusation.</p> <p>Wigdor said his decision was made on Wednesday, a day after CNN published <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/19/politics/tara-reade-biden-allegation/index.html\">a story</a> raising questions about Reade\u2019s background and her past statements. Though in the statement announcing the split, the lawyer vociferously attacked Reade\u2019s treatment by the press.</p> <p>\u201cTo a large extent Ms Reade has been subjected to a double standard in terms of the media coverage she has received. Much of what has been written about Ms Reade is not probative of whether then-Senator Biden sexually assaulted her, but rather is intended to victim-shame and attack her credibility on unrelated and irrelevant matters,\u201d Wigdor said.</p> <p>Meanwhile, defense lawyers in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/california\">California</a> have said that they are reviewing criminal cases in which Reade has served as an expert witness on domestic violence, out of concern that she had misrepresented her educational credentials in court.</p> <p>Days after CNN <a href=\"https://t.co/U3p0xLB5TT\">raised questions</a> about Reade\u2019s educational background, a spokesperson for Antioch University confirmed to the New York Times that she had not received a degree from the school.</p>",

But his mistreatment of black people, verbally and politically, is decades old, and is a reflection of the Democratic party in general.</p> \n<p>Throughout Biden\u2019s career, he has boasted about his ability to bridge partisan divides by sacrificing the needs of black people and poor people in the name of \u201ccompromise\u201d. For the last 30 years, Biden has repeatedly talked about freezing, cutting, or raising the age for social security and other benefits \u2013 as much as $2tn one time. <a href=\"http://inthesetimes.com/article/21856/joe-biden-cut-medicare-social-security-retirement-age\">His response</a> to concerns that these cuts would hurt the poor? \u201cWe\u2019re going to do lots of hard things \u2026 we might as well do this.\u201d</p> \n<p>Social security is an important program for black people, especially as we age.

Biden authored and successfully passed the $30bn 1994 <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/6/20/18677998/joe-biden-1994-crime-bill-law-mass-incarceration\">Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act</a>. Besides putting 100,000 additional police officers in the streets, the crime bill distributed funding for new prison construction, encouraged prosecutors to charge children as adults, and even added the death penalty for 28 new areas, including <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-69-federal-death-penalty-act-1994\">drug-related offenses</a>. Pushing for further criminalization, then senator Biden argued that George HW Bush\u2019s crime plan <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?8997-1/democratic-response-drug-policy-address\">did not go far enough</a> because it did not \u201cinclude enough police officers to catch the violent thugs, not enough prosecutors to convict them, not enough judges to sentence them, and not enough prison cells to put them away for a long time\u201d. An older black generation fought through Jim Crow only for Biden to help make sure that their children and grandchildren lived through a new Jim Crow.</p> \n<p>On the House floor, Biden compared his <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/us/joe-biden-crime-laws.html\">criminal justice approach</a> to Richard Nixon\u2019s law and order stance: \u201cI would say, \u2018Lock the SOBs up.\u2019\u201d Black people were arrested in droves following this bill, despite comparable drug use rates to white people; many are still sitting in prison today. Biden has since acknowledged flaws in the bill, but last summer he reiterated his support for the bill. The law spent $30bn but contributed to only <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/26/opinion/the-police-cant-solve-the-problem-they-are-the-problem.html\">a 1.3% decline in violent crime</a>. He has yet to call for it to be repealed.</p> \n<p>Today, some cities plan to expunge marijuana records and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/12/02/evanston-illinois-reparations-plan-african-americans-is-marijuana-tax/\">hope to pay reparations</a> to black people formerly incarcerated for marijuana offenses. But Biden can\u2019t seem to let go; <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/02/06/joe-biden-legalize-marijuana-111642\">he is inconsistent and ambivalent about marijuana legalization</a>. He has <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/18/politics/joe-biden-marijuana-gateway-drug/index.html\">argued</a> it may be a gateway drug, a statement he has since <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomangell/2020/03/06/joe-biden-is-frustrated-people-think-he-still-believes-marijuana-is-a-gateway-drug/#5a5184749aa2\">dialed back</a>.<strong> </strong>Of course, keeping marijuana illegal at the federal level does not mean that people will not use it, but rather that the extra police that he put on the street will send people of color to jail for using it. Ironically, the police were probably nowhere to be found when Biden\u2019s friends <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/20/politics/in-secretly-taped-conversations-glimpses-of-the-future-president.html\">George W Bush</a> and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/\">Barack Obama</a> used marijuana. If anything, the drug seems to be a gateway to the White House.</p> \n<p>Despite attempting to cut social programs and increasing mass incarceration, Biden claims to care about black families. But he doesn\u2019t seem to know many. During the September 2019 Democratic debate he claimed that poor families should put on a <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/video/sports/joe-biden-parents-should-make-sure-you-have-the-record-player-on-at-night-to-expand-childrens-vocabulary/vi-AAHfDMH\">record player</a> so their children will know more words. Recently, during an interview with the New York Times editorial board, he argued that poor black parents feel ashamed <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/01/17/opinion/joe-biden-nytimes-interview.html\">because they cannot read and skip parent-teacher conferences</a>. He was hoping to encourage them to be better parents. But his assertion is incorrect. Black and white parents have comparable participation rates overall and attend parent-teacher conferences at the <a href=\"https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2017/2017102.pdf\">exact same rates</a>. In fact, black parents and poor parents are the most likely to check their children\u2019s homework and <a href=\"https://nces.ed.gov/pubs2017/2017102.pdf\">meet with</a> guidance counselors. Biden instead relied on stereotypes that black people are not involved in their children\u2019s lives.</p> \n<p>Harris forced Biden to confront his work with racist elected officials to stop integration efforts using school busing. That was not his only education mistake. Biden played a significant role in creating the student debt crisis, including making student loan discharge \u201c<a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/01/07/joe-biden-student-loans/\">nearly impossible</a>\u201d. This is devastating to black people, who disproportionately carry school debt. While the <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/06/why-women-hold-the-majority-of-student-loans.html\">average school debt</a> for black women with a bachelor\u2019s degree is about $25,000, that level of education does not provide the same level of financial security for black women as it does other groups, including white people with less education (primarily because of sexism and racism).</p> \n<p>Again and again, Biden\u2019s relationship with black Americans, like the Democratic National Committee\u2019s relationship, has been patronizing at best and actively harmful at worst.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Biden\u2019s friendship with one black person does not mean that he\u2019s a friend to black people</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Some black people will support Biden because of his association with Barack Obama \u2013 even though <a href=\"https://www.gq.com/story/obama-to-biden-dont-run\">Obama himself doesn\u2019t seem especially excited about Biden</a> becoming president. The Obama days feel distant yet warm compared to Donald Trump\u2019s current presidency. But remember: Biden cycled millions of black people in and out of jail, voted for massive numbers of poor people to go to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/12/us/politics/joe-biden-iraq-war.html\">war in Iraq</a>, threw Anita Hill under the bus <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/25/us/politics/joe-biden-anita-hill.html\">to confirm a conservative justice</a> to the US supreme court, and, under Obama\u2019s administration, helped to deport <a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2019/11/joe-biden-deportations-immigration-barack-obama\">millions of immigrants</a> and <a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2018/08/joe-biden-democratic-party-military-hawk\">bombed brown countries</a>. When Biden was vice-president, black <a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2017/12/obama-foreclosure-crisis-wealth-inequality\">home ownership and wealth</a> declined significantly, even as it <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2019/02/28/feature/the-heartbreaking-decrease-in-black-homeownership/\">rose</a> for other races. Biden\u2019s friendship with one black person does not mean that he\u2019s a friend to black people.</p> \n<p>The Democratic party holds black people in an abusive relationship but says you cannot leave because the other option is more abusive. That\u2019s why I don\u2019t believe that a vote against Biden solely means a vote for Trump. Perhaps it is a vote against being captured by the party that makes empty promises every four years when it is election time, and delivers nothing. Perhaps it is a vote against the crime bill, drones and deportations. Perhaps it is a vote against covert and overt racism.</p> \n<p>Biden and others will rightfully argue that Trump is worse, and I agree. But what can Biden actually deliver? Will there be fewer drones if he\u2019s president? Maybe not. Fewer deportations? Maybe not. Less money to police departments? No. Will fewer black people die from police? Unlikely. Will black people have healthcare? Unlikely. Will black wealth increase? Unlikely. Will Palestinian lives be safer? Unlikely. Commitments to preserving our climate? Doubtful. If black people have a hard time figuring out the differences between Trump and Biden, then that is Biden\u2019s problem, not ours.</p> \n<p>Joe Biden refuses to reckon with the harm that he has caused to people all over the world. His best line is that he is better than the other guy, and that is exactly how abusive relationships function. Black people \u2013 all people \u2013 deserve better than Biden and the Democratic party. And yes, we are still black.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Derecka Purnell is a social movement lawyer and writer based in Washington, DC.

In America we need more prayer, not less.\u201d</p> \n<p>After his two-minute statement, the president left the briefing room podium without taking questions.</p> \n<p>His remarks sowed confusion because the federal government does not have the constitutional right to unilaterally order individual states to reopen businesses, churches or schools.

But it omitted details about houses of worship and faith-based organisations.</p> \n<p>There has been friction between Trump and state governors during the coronavirus pandemic. Last month the president claimed he had \u201ctotal\u201d authority over reopening plans but then appeared to backpedal from that position.</p> \n<p>At Friday\u2019s briefing, the White House press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, deflected questions about Trump\u2019s threat to override governors and clashed with reporters.</p> \n<p>\u201cBoy, it\u2019s interesting to be in a room that desperately wants to see these churches and houses of worship stay closed,\u201d she said sardonically.</p> \n<p>Jeff Mason of Reuters replied: \u201cKayleigh, I object to that. I go to church. I\u2019m dying to go back to church. The question that we\u2019re asking you, and would like to have asked the president and Dr Birx, is is it safe?\u201d</p>",

He\u2019s exercised sound judgment \u201cin a Victorian way \u2013 slow steady cautious\u201d. Opening up needs to be done \u201cproperly and once\u201d.</p> \n<p>The quibbling so far is having no impact on Andrews\u2019 popularity, which will inevitably come under greater pressure as the full economic impact becomes clear. People often rally around a leader at a time of crisis, and all state leaders, as well as Morrison, have seen their support soar.</p> \n<p>An <a href=\"https://essentialvision.com.au/category/essentialreport\">Essential poll</a> last week showed 71% of Victorians rated their government\u2019s performance as good or very good.</p> \n<h2>\u2018Sticking to his guns\u2019</h2> \n<p>Kosmos Samaras served as Victorian Labor\u2019s deputy campaign director for 14 years until 2019, and now heads RedBridge, a political consultancy. Since March, the company has conducted detailed focus groups around the Covid-19 response, predominantly in Victoria (Samaras says the company has no political or corporate clients for this work).</p> \n<p>The pressure from some commentators to reopen quickly is not supported by the majority of voters, especially those in outer suburbs and regional areas. Samaras says that those now on jobkeeper or jobseeker are also cautious.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey understand that if the lockdown is lifted too early or too quickly, we could endure another lockdown and they can\u2019t afford that.\u201d</p> \n<p>Morrison\u2019s performance is highly praised, but Andrews stands out. \u201cParticipants from across the political spectrum are praising his actions,\u201d the March report found. \u201cHe is consistently described as \u2018transparent\u2019, \u2018forthright\u2019, \u2018proactive\u201d, \u2018compassionate\u2019 and \u2018assertive\u2019 on behalf of Victorians.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a5c4880e73f2ee32483e01246897c825f27b8ab\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9a5c4880e73f2ee32483e01246897c825f27b8ab/0_0_3088_4632/667.jpg\" alt=\"Daniel Andrews watches Brett Sutton\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daniel Andrews has been consistent in following the advice of his chief health officer, Brett Sutton.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Pockett/AAP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The report of 6 May found Victorians were \u201cstill firmly in favour of a \u2018very careful\u2019, \u2018slow and safe\u2019 ending to the lockdown\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThose arguing against it are largely seen as pushing personal agendas (selfishness) or being motivated by the wrong things (money).

They want a more self-sufficient Australia, one that \u201cgoes back to building and making things here\u201d.</p> \n<h2>Political supremacy</h2> \n<p>All of which makes the job of an opposition leader tough. Michael O\u2019Brien, a former treasurer, is considered a measured moderate, and became leader of the Liberal party after the devastating election loss of 2018. The party did not expect to win that election, but the 6% swing against them \u2013 especially the desertion of small-l liberal voters in its Melbourne heartland \u2013 highlighted an identity crisis that still persists. The level of personal animosity within the party administration, says one senior Liberal, means \u201cthe Victorian division is regarded as the most dysfunctional\u201d in the country.</p> \n<p>The party\u2019s state conference has been postponed due to the pandemic, and with it, as former ABC presenter Jon Faine <a href=\"https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/victorian-libs-tearing-themselves-apart-as-andrews-soars-20200515-p54tby.html\">wrote recently</a>, \u201cthe deferral of a reckoning\u201d with moderates keen to reduce the influence of rightwing religious activists.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e05e9b7ecbdcdda823a4587d0d32c2735e9d8d6d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e05e9b7ecbdcdda823a4587d0d32c2735e9d8d6d/2760_675_1713_2142/800.jpg\" alt=\"Victorian Liberal MP Tim Smith\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Victorian Liberal MP Tim Smith has frustrated colleagues with his relentless attacks on Andrews.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Murray/AAP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Federally, the looming vacancy created by Senate president Scott Ryan\u2019s retirement is a test of that, as is a bitter battle over the seat of Menzies, where rightwing veteran Kevin Andrews is resisting pressure to retire.</p> \n<p>O\u2019Brien is doing what he can, putting forward policy proposals to help Victoria\u2019s recovery, including exempting small and medium businesses from payroll tax. The government deserves to be scrutinised on many fronts, including the lack of independent oversight over billions in spending, and the $24.5bn in new borrowing the government is proposing, which will more than triple state debt.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf we just see budget black holes being filled and paying recurrent expenses like public service wages out of borrowed money, that is the road to economic ruin,\u2019\u2019 O\u2019Brien told the Age recently.</p> \n<p>Victoria\u2019s engagement with China over its Belt and Road initiative \u2013 against national policy \u2013 and the suggestion of state treasurer Tim Pallas that Canberra had vilified China by pursuing an independent coronavirus inquiry, has <a href=\"https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/victorian-treasurer-s-china-comments-spark-outrage-among-federal-colleagues-20200519-p54uix.html\">raised eyebrows</a> even among senior Labor figures.</p> \n<p>Yet O\u2019Brien\u2019s efforts have been undermined from within. Shadow planning minister Tim Smith, a master of self-promotion, has been tweeting away for months, first demanding the resignation of a senior health official for her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/victoria-defends-deputy-chief-medical-officer-after-she-compared-james-cook-to-covid-19\">tweet comparing the coronavirus with Captain Cook\u2019s arrival</a>, and then indulging in almost daily sprays against Andrews. O\u2019Brien had had enough when Smith called the premier \u201cloony\u201d.</p> \n<p>Smith is close to the most senior Victorian federal Liberal, treasurer Josh Frydenberg, and no doubt has leadership ambitions, premature for now.

Score points and you\u2019ll turn voters off. Stay quiet and you\u2019ll allow Andrews to continue his dominance. \u201cAndrews has now reached a point of such supremacy in the political landscape, they can\u2019t just keep on keeping the gloves off.\u201d</p> \n<p>Andrews doesn\u2019t have to do much to swat away the Liberals for now. Smith posted a silly Twitter poll a few days ago, asking whether Andrews should be called \u201cChairman\u201d or \u201cDictator\u201d.</p> \n<p>Asked about it, Andrews said: \u201cI don\u2019t comment on people who are fundamentally irrelevant to the work that I do.\u201d</p> \n<p>Easy.</p>",
  "<p>India has reported more than 6,000 new Covid-19 cases, its biggest one-day increase, while China<strong> </strong>has abandoned setting a GDP growth target because of the \u201cgreat uncertainty\u201d caused by the pandemic.</p> <p>The sharp increase in new infections in <strong>India</strong> came after the government began easing lockdown restrictions and as airlines prepared to reopen selected domestic routes.</p> <p>\u201cThis surge has happened after movement of people was partially allowed,\u201d said Giridhar Babu, an epidemiologist at India\u2019s public health foundation. \u201cBut if you see overall, this is a much lower trajectory as compared to the rest of the world.\u201d</p> <p>Babu said India \u201cseems to have the capacity\u201d to contain the coronavirus, after authorities reported a total of more than 118,000 cases \u2013 up 5% from Thursday\u2019s figure - including 3,583 deaths.</p> <p>India\u2019s lockdown has been extended to 31 May but the rules have been relaxed in regions less severely affected by the pandemic. Roughly 30% of domestic flights are due to resume from Monday.</p> <p>Infections have surged in <strong>Indonesia</strong>,<strong> </strong>the world\u2019s fourth most populous nation, ahead of celebrations this weekend to mark the end of Ramadan, raising questions about the government\u2019s commitment to curbing the pandemic.</p> <p>The country reported 973 new cases, its highest one-day count, bringing its official total to more than 21,000 \u2013 although the real figure is thought to be much higher. Officials have said the public are not taking proper precautions, but only four of 34 provinces and 26 cities have imposed wide-scale restrictions.</p> <p>The rates of new infections have begun to dip in much of the world, but the disease is continuing its deadly march in <strong>Latin</strong> <strong>America</strong>, which was described by the World Health Organization on Friday as \u201ca new epicentre\u201d of the pandemic.</p> <p><strong>Russia</strong> reported 150 new deaths, a record daily number that took the country\u2019s official death toll from Covid-19 to 3,249. Authorities reported 8,894 new coronavirus cases, bringing the total to 326,448.</p> <p><strong>China</strong>\u2019s 3,000-member National People\u2019s Congress opened in Beijing on Friday with a minute\u2019s silence for coronavirus victims. The gathering was delayed by two months and has been shortened to a week because of the pandemic.</p> <p>In an apparent acknowledgement of the steep challenges China faces from a stricken economy and increasing international hostility, the premier, Li Keqiang, said \u201cno specific target\u201d would be set for growth this year, for the first time since the country began publishing GDP goals in 1990.</p> <p>\u201cThis is because our country will face some factors that are difficult to predict in its development due to the great uncertainty regarding the Covid-19 pandemic and the world economic and trade environment,\u201d Li said, adding that the government would instead \u201cgive priority to stabilising employment and ensuring living standards\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Singapore</strong> said its case total now exceeded 30,000, with 612 new infections, almost entirely in cramped dormitories for the city state\u2019s low-paid migrant workers.</p> <p><strong>Thailand</strong> said it would maintain its state of emergency until the end of June. Shopping centres and department stores in the kingdom opened at the weekend for the first time in almost two months as the rate of infection slowed, but bars, nightclubs, cinemas, playgrounds and some sports remain off-limits.</p> <p>The WHO said <strong>Africa</strong> was approaching 100,000 confirmed Covid-19 cases.</p> <p>The UN said the virus was assumed to be spreading throughout <strong>Yemen</strong>. Appealing for urgent funding, Jens Laerke, a spokesman for the UN office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs, said Yemen\u2019s healthcare system \u201chas in effect collapsed\u201d.</p> <p>He said aid workers were turning people away because of a lack of medical oxygen or sufficient supplies of personal protective equipment in the war-ravaged country. Yemen\u2019s malnourished population has among the world\u2019s lowest immunity levels.</p> <p>Months before a general election in <strong>New Zealand</strong>, the leader of the main opposition party was ousted after a poll showed an 84% approval rating for the way the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, has handled the pandemic.</p> <p>In the <strong>US</strong>, pictures emerged of Donald Trump wearing a face mask during a factory visit in Michigan. The president had earlier been called a \u201cpetulant child\u201d by a state attorney general for allegedly refusing to wear a mask during a tour of the plant.</p> <p>The <strong>Czech Republic</strong> said the virus remained under control nearly two weeks after shopping centres, cinemas and restaurant terraces were reopened. \u201cThe massive easing of 11 May did not affect the epidemiological curve,\u201d said the health minister, Adam Vojtech.</p> <p>In <strong>Spain</strong>, the government said the Madrid region and the Barcelona metropolitan area \u2013 the two areas hardest hit by Covid-19 \u2013 would be able to move into the next phase of lockdown de-escalation from Monday.</p> <p>The loosening means all of Spain will now be in at least the second phase of the exit plan: people can meet in groups of up to 10, and restaurant and cafe terraces can reopen at 50% capacity. Places of worship will be able to operate at 30% capacity.</p> <p>The health minister, Salvador Illa, said 47% of the country would move to the third and penultimate stage on Monday, meaning people can visit shopping centres and eat inside restaurants, both of which will operate at 40% capacity.</p>",

The home secretary, Priti Patel, is expected to unveil the plans at the daily Downing Street briefing later. The measures, which will be introduced next month, will be reviewed every three weeks, the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, said. Tony Smith, a former head of Border Force, said he was surprised quarantine measures had not been brought in sooner.</p> \n  <p><strong>Sir Paul Nurse: \u2018We are desperate for clear leadership\u2019</strong></p> \n  <p>Sir Paul Nurse, the chief executive of the Francis Crick Institute and 2001 Nobel laureate for medicine, has delivered a scathing attack on the government\u2019s handling of the crisis. \u201cWe are desperate for clear leadership at all levels,\u201d he told the BBC. He said the UK had been \u201ctoo much on the back foot, increasingly playing catchup\u201d.</p> \n  <p><strong>Care home boss calls for repeat testing</strong></p> \n  <p>Weekly testing of all residents and staff could help ease the Covid-19 outbreak in care homes, the boss of one of the UK\u2019s largest care providers said. Sam Monaghan, chief executive of MHA, which took part in a government pilot of whole-home testing, said asymptomatic cases meant the virus could spread without being noticed. He said: \u201cWhat we\u2019re saying is either once a week or once a fortnight. Some of the research that seems to have been done would suggest that weekly would be the most effective way. There was a real reluctance to test staff. They were going to test the residents but they were not going to test the staff. But that was the most highly likely way the infection could have come into the home.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Government borrowing hits record \u00a362bn in April</strong></p> \n  <p>UK government borrowing hit its highest level on record last month amid the Covid-19 pandemic, as retail sales across the country plunged at a record pace. The Office for National Statistics reported that public borrowing in April is estimated to have surged to \u00a362.1bn. That\u2019s \u00a351.1bn more than in April 2019, and the highest borrowing in any month since records began in January 1993.</p> \n  <p><strong>Independent Sage warns against school reopening plan</strong></p> \n  <p>The Independent Sage committee has warned that 1 June is too soon for schools to reopen safely and that more time is needed to set up an effective track and trace system to contain future outbreaks. The group, chaired by the former government chief scientist Sir David King, says that new modelling of the coronavirus shows the risk to children will be halved if they return to school two weeks later than ministers propose. Delaying until September reduced the risk still further. A straw poll of Unison members working in schools in England found that the vast majority remain concerned over the safety of their workplaces opening to more pupils on 1 June.</p> \n  <p><strong>New spitting incident at a London station</strong></p> \n  <p>Union leaders have condemned another \u201cdisgusting and frightening\u201d spitting incident at a London station. The Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA) said a man approached staff at Mile End London underground station on Thursday and demanded they open the gate as he did not have a ticket for the barriers. He became aggressive and swore at an older female customer who intervened, and spat at her, said the union. British Transport Police were called and spit samples were taken from the female customer\u2019s face and arm.

Delaying until September reduced the risk still further.</p> \n  <p>The extra two weeks would allow more time for infections to fall in the community and for crucial track and trace capacity to be built up so that new cases are found and isolated fast. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIt is clear from the evidence we have collected that 1 June is simply too early to go back. By going ahead with this dangerous decision, the government is further risking the health of our communities and the likelihood of a second spike,\u201d Professor King said. </p> \n  <p>In a draft consultation published on Friday, the experts say local authorities must demonstrate low levels of infection and an ability to contain new infections before schools are reopened, with public consultation a \u201cvital\u201d part of the decision-making process.</p> \n  <p>The report urges authorities to consider summer camps and outdoor schools for educating children with community playing fields and sports clubs requisitioned for teaching purposes.</p> \n  <p>King said the decision of when to re-open schools was a \u201ccareful balance\u201d but added it was vital for young people to get back to the classroom as soon as it was safe to do so. \u201cThe current climate is likely to disproportionately affect the most disadvantaged in society, therefore it is vital that the government also considers innovative ways to help those who need it most.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>Professor King established the Independent Sage committee amid concerns over the lack of transparency around scientific advice reaching ministers from the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), co-chaired by the chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance and England\u2019s chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty. </p> \n  <p>Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the school leaders\u2019 union NAHT, said: \u201cSupport for a fixed date for school return is vanishing quickly.

After insisting she was innocent for a year, Loughlin and her husband are changing their tune, \u201cwhich just shows you how sick people are of being locked in their homes with their families\u201d, said Noah. \u201cTwo months of corona, and she was like: \u2018Actually, your honor, I\u2019m guilty, just take me to prison.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>On the other hand, it\u2019s a \u201cgenius time to plead guilty to any crime\u201d, he said, because coronavirus mandates keeping people out of prison.

It is only a matter of time before the death toll reaches 100,000.</p> <p>During the Democratic primary, Biden spoke of restoring normalcy after four years of Donald Trump, frequently appealing to voters\u2019 nostalgia for the presidency of Barack Obama. But now, as he faces the general election amid the deepening economic turmoil, the presumptive Democratic nominee is reaching for the legacy of a radical American president: Franklin Delano Roosevelt.</p> <p>\u201cThe blinders have been taken off,\u201d Biden told supporters recently during a virtual fundraiser from his Delaware home, where he has been since March. \u201cBecause of this Covid crisis, I think people are realizing, \u2018My Lord, look at what is possible. Look at the institutional changes we can make.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>In recent weeks, Biden, who has climbed above Trump in national polls, has openly courted progressive leaders and ideas, adopting some of the populist rhetoric more commonly associated with his vanquished rivals, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. In turn, they have offered their full-throated endorsements, casting Biden, a pragmatic dealmaker who still believes in bipartisan comity, as the perhaps unlikely herald of a new progressive era.</p> <p>\u201cA shift of frame matters \u2013 it\u2019s not to be underestimated,\u201d the California congressman Ro Khanna, who was a co-chair of Sanders\u2019 presidential campaign, said of Biden\u2019s bold messaging. \u201cIt\u2019s a totally different vision for what he thinks the next four years should be about.\u201d</p> <p>Neither Biden nor Trump has yet laid out their vision for what the first 100 days of a new presidency might look like, a benchmark established by FDR during which he offered a series of sweeping reforms.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"15487949ca75156728438b402f9ed98ca453e478\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/15487949ca75156728438b402f9ed98ca453e478/0_0_3000_2301/1000.jpg\" alt=\"President Franklin D Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal was a try-anything moment during the Great Depression that remade the role of the federal government in American life.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"767\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">President Franklin D Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal was a try-anything moment during the Great Depression that remade the role of the federal government in American life.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\ufeffBut Biden and his economic advisers believe they must be prepared to marshal a far more ambitious domestic agenda than they initially imagined. During daily virtual meetings, Biden and his team are beginning to draft a new governing vision that reflects the scale and urgency of the crisis that Biden predicted may \u201ceclipse what FDR faced\u201d.</p> <p>The task is not entirely new to Biden. As vice-president, he led the Obama administration\u2019s response to the recession, and his campaign hopes to leverage his remarkably scandal-free stewardship of the nearly $800bn stimulus package with Trump\u2019s handling of the economy.</p> <p>In the coming weeks, Biden said he would share a detailed plan \u201cfor the right kind of economic recovery\u201d, aspects of which are expected to include massive investment in public health, expansive legislative action on climate change, and broad new protections for workers.</p> <p>Last week, Biden announced six policy taskforces \u2013 centered around issues that include healthcare, climate and the economy \u2013 that pair his supporters with ideological allies of Sanders. Among those chosen to participate are some of the young, progressive leaders most skeptical of his approach, including the New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. </p> <p>In a joint press release announcing the taskforces, Biden said the groups would help \u201ctransform our country\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cVice-President Biden understands in his gut that this is a totally different order of magnitude than any president has ever dealt with,\u201d said Mary Kay Henry, president of the Service Employees International Union and a member of the healthcare taskforce.</p> <p>Henry said the coronavirus has exposed the underlying causes of the US\u2019s problems, calling public attention to issues she believes government and business leaders can no longer afford to ignore.</p> <p>\u201cWe had [38] million people that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/21/us-unemployment-figures-jobs-lost-coronavirus\">have lost jobs</a>. But that\u2019s on top of the 64 million Americans who already made less than $15 an hour before Covid,\u201d she said. Without paid sick leave, some essential workers are reporting for work even if they feel ill because they can\u2019t afford the alternative while fast-food and healthcare workers stage protests to demand protective equipment.</p> <p>\u201cThat level of inequality has sort of hit people between the eyes.\u201d</p> <p>Jared Bernstein, one of Biden\u2019s economic advisers, said Biden was looking beyond the \u201ccyclical\u201d challenges posed by the pandemic to the many \u201cstructural\u201d problems it has revealed.</p> <p>\u201cBiden is, I think, developing a particularly robust agenda that really strikes at this reality that the Trump economy was built on a house of sand and has turned out to be totally non-resilient to any shock,\u201d said Bernstein, who advised Biden during his tenure as vice-president.</p> <p>Biden, Bernstein said, recognizes the need for an \u201curgent expansion\u201d that better insulates the American economy from the \u201cshocks that are coming fast and furiously\u201d not as a direct result of the pandemic but from climate change and income inequality.</p> <p>Biden has also made other gestures. He has adopted aspects of Sanders\u2019 free college tuition proposal. He has embraced Elizabeth Warren\u2019s bankruptcy proposal and joined with the senator, viewed as a potential running mate, to call for better oversight of how the Trump administration spends the coronavirus relief fund. </p> <p>Critics on the left have scoffed at the notion of Biden as an FDR-style visionary. After all, they say, Biden once told supporters that under his presidency \u201cnothing would fundamentally change\u201d.</p> <p>David Sirota, a former adviser to Sanders 2020 presidential campaign, dismissed Biden\u2019s overtures to the left as performative politics \u2013 a \u201ccanned SNL skit\u201d that progressives were being asked to accept as \u201csomething real\u201d.</p> <p>\ufeffRepublicans, meanwhile, view Biden\u2019s expanding policy aspirations as a political gift. After the taskforce members were announced, the Republican National Committee tagged Biden a \u201cbanner-man for the socialist agenda\u201d.</p> <p>Biden\u2019s policy platform \u2013 which includes a public option for healthcare and an aggressive plan to combat the climate crisis \u2013 might have been considered far-reaching in another presidential cycle. But during the primary he resisted pressure from activists to embrace progressive litmus-test items such as Medicare for All and a Green New Deal.</p> <p>Campaign aides and allies say Biden\u2019s calls for change are part of a policy evolution in response to the crisis, not a sudden embrace of a Sanders-style agenda. Biden himself has pointed to his nearly 50-year political career as a guide for how he would make \u201cinstitutional\u201d changes \u201cwithout us becoming a socialist country, or any of that malarkey\u201d.</p> <p>Michael Gwin, a spokesman for Biden\u2019s campaign, said: \u201cHe\u2019s scaling up the solutions he\u2019s proposed so that we can meet this moment, get through this crisis, and ensure that we come out on the other end with a stronger middle class and a more resilient country.\u201d</p> <p>Surrounding his planning for the presidency is the uncertainty over who will control the House and Senate, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/18/us-senate-democrats-elections-2020\">which is suddenly within reach for Democrats</a>. Yet there are signs that the coronavirus, and Trump\u2019s handling of the crisis, have scrambled the political calculus, giving Biden new latitude to move in a far bolder direction.</p> <p>A recent survey by the non-partisan <a href=\"https://www.people-press.org/2020/04/21/positive-economic-views-plummet-support-for-government-aid-crosses-party-lines/\">Pew Research Center</a> found that the public\u2019s view of the economy has darkened dramatically: just 23% of Americans describe the economic outlook as \u201cexcellent\u201d or \u201cgood\u201d, down from 57% at the start of the year. The same poll found <a href=\"https://www.people-press.org/2020/04/21/positive-economic-views-plummet-support-for-government-aid-crosses-party-lines/\">overwhelming</a> support for the $2tn coronavirus relief measure passed by Congress last month, a marked contrast from the<a href=\"https://www.people-press.org/2009/03/16/obamas-approval-rating-slips-amid-division-over-economic-proposals/\"> polarized, partisan views</a> of the stimulus package passed to stem the economic fallout from the Great Recession.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t underscore enough the extent to which this economic moment is unprecedented,\u201d said Steph Sterling, vice-president of advocacy and policy at the liberal Roosevelt Institute. \u201cOur institutions need to shift to meet the moment in a way that only government can.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>When the NFL <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/06/sports/pro-football-inside-the-nfl-nfl-pressured-on-black-coaches.html\">first was made to formally address</a> the embarrassing lack of diversity in its coaching and front-office ranks back in the early aughts, a scant three of the league\u2019s 32 teams were helmed by minority head coaches. Seventeen years since the introduction of the Rooney Rule, which requires all clubs to interview at least one minority candidate for its openings at head coach and general manager, the grand total entering the 2020 season has inched upward to four: the Dolphins\u2019 Brian Flores, the Chargers\u2019 Anthony Lynn and the Steelers\u2019 Mike Tomlin, who are African American, and Washington\u2019s Ron Rivera, who is Hispanic.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/19/nfl-rooney-rule-minority-head-coaches-draft-picks-football\">NFL owners pass on plan to boost diversity by improving teams' draft picks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Lately it feels like we\u2019re moving backwards. Only three of the 20 head coaching gigs that have opened up since the end of the 2017 season have been filled by minorities, an unacceptable outcome in a league where more than 70% of the players are African American. Among the highly qualified coaches of color passed over for less accomplished candidates in this most recent hiring cycle were Kansas City Chiefs offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy and San Francisco 49ers defensive coordinator Robert Saleh, who each played central roles in guiding their teams to this year\u2019s Super Bowl. Too many teams have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2018/jan/24/rooney-rule-black-coaches-nfl\">violated the spirit of the rule</a>, bringing in minority candidates for sham interviews with a preordained hire waiting in the wings, safe in the knowledge a bad-faith search is practically impossible to prove. Only once in nearly two decades has a club been penalized for non-compliance: when the Detroit Lions couldn\u2019t keep it in their pants long enough to at least do the dance before hiring Steve Mariucci, <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20080213161435/http://cbs.sportsline.com/nfl/story/6498949\">earning them a $200,000 fine</a> in 2003.</p> <p>It\u2019s become clear the Rooney Rule is deeply flawed. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell admitted as much during his annual state of the league address in January, promising tangible steps toward fixing the problem this offseason. Those discussions began this week with an aggressive proposal to improve teams\u2019 third-round draft picks between six and 10 spots if they hired a head coach or general manager of color, in addition to other compensation for hiring minority candidates as positional assistants.</p> <p>The owners <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/19/nfl-rooney-rule-minority-head-coaches-draft-picks-football\">chose to table the incentive scheme</a>, instead doubling down on the Rooney Rule. \u201cClubs will now be required to interview at least two external minority candidates for head coach vacancies; at least one minority candidate for any of the three coordinator vacancies; and at least one external candidate for the senior football operations or general manager position,\u201d the NFL said in a statement.</p> <p>Alas, the reloaded fiat is little more than a bandaid on a broken leg. Measures like these will only result in more of the same problems because they fail to address the root cause.</p> <p>The issue starts at the college level, a choking off of the pipeline that helps explain the dismal outcomes in the pros. The universities that comprise the NCAA\u2019s power five conferences <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/college-football-doesnt-give-black-coaches-many-chances/\">aren\u2019t hiring black coaches</a>. Alumni and boosters <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/10257706/booster-red-mccombs-bashes-texas-longhorns-charlie-strong-hire\">aren\u2019t supporting black coaches</a>. When black coaches do manage to land a top job, they are given a shorter timeframe to prove themselves and almost never get second chances at the same level after they\u2019re let go. Two of the most prominent black trailblazers at storied football schools, Charlie Strong at the the University of Texas and Tyrone Willingham at Notre Dame, were kneecapped after three seasons: before their first recruiting classes had even reached their senior year. And that\u2019s putting aside the insidious process of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/sep/20/black-quarterbacks-history-stereotypes\">racial stacking</a> that funnels black players into certain positions traditionally less conducive to the transition into coaching.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1f78f7d4f9c9586b3bf050ad8e757898024cbde4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f78f7d4f9c9586b3bf050ad8e757898024cbde4/0_0_3978_2592/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Charlie Strong\" width=\"1000\" height=\"652\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charlie Strong had yet to coach his first game at the University of Texas when an influential booster called his hiring a \u201ckick in the face\u201d during a radio interview.

Flatly stated, the lack of minority representation in positions of power is debilitating toward any meaningful push for diversity. \u201cCollege coaches are expected to fundraise and schmooze with alumni as well as coach,\u201d <a href=\"https://apnews.com/1a380b8902fdd13b5a3aa5d7c5bfc44b\">says</a> Mark Naison, a professor of African American studies and history at Fordham University. \u201cThe rich alumni, most of whom are white, feel more comfortable with people who look like them. So long as alumni dollars drive college football funding, white coaches will have a huge hiring advantage.\u201d</p> <p>What the NCAA can and should do is address the problem from the ground up by creating more opportunities for minorities in athletic departments and designating scholarships for students of color that are interested in sports-related careers. Relying on the intermittent largesse of those in power just isn\u2019t cutting it.</p> <p>The Rooney Rule, despite its notorious lack of efficacy, is a net positive because it gives minority coaches the opportunity to at least get in front of teams and impress them. After a candidate interviews once or twice they can know what to expect and be better prepared for the process in the future.</p> <p>But the <a href=\"https://www.bannersociety.com/2017/8/9/20726457/black-head-coaches\">systemic barriers to entry</a> that have been installed over more than a century of organized football can\u2019t be undone with a flick of the pen. At the end of the day, the people that put Trump in office are the same trustees on those boards and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/nov/11/sports-team-owners-make-huge-political-donations-where-does-their-money-go\">same people that own NFL teams</a>.</p> <p>Another less obvious roadblock, as one African American assistant currently on an NFL coaching staff explained to me, is that many white head coaches simply don\u2019t know nearly as many of their black counterparts. They don\u2019t want to lose the black coaches they have and are comfortable with, he says, which often leads to black coaches being held back out of their superior\u2019s self-interest. While he disagrees with the NFL\u2019s shelved plan of offering teams draft selections for hiring coaches of color, he would support the awarding of compensatory picks for promoting minorities from within the organization. Another suggestion: Shutting down or at least somehow regulating the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/the-nepotism-football-league/2015/09/27/6fd94bee-6305-11e5-b38e-06883aacba64_story.html\">rampant culture of nepotism</a> that enables family members of coaches to skip the process over guys who have a track record of success in the league wouldn\u2019t hurt.</p> <p>\u201cClearly we are not where we want to be on this level,\u201d Goodell said in January. \u201cIt\u2019s clear we need to change and do something different. There\u2019s no reason to expect we\u2019re going to have a different outcome next year without those kinds of changes.\u201d</p> <p>Admitting you have a problem is the first step. But getting the NFL where it needs to be on diversity, while not impossible, is a heavier ask than anyone wants to admit.</p>",
