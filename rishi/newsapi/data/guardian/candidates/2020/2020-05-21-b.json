We are very concerned about rising cases in low- and middle-income countries,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>Meanwhile Europe\u2019s director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the agency responsible for advising governments, including the UK, on disease control, has said that Europe should brace for a second wave of infections \u2013 \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/top-eu-doctor-europe-should-brace-itself-for-second-wave-of-coronavirus\">The question is when and how big.

That it\u2019s not the time now to completely relax,\u201d she said. </p> \n  <p>Here are the top developments from the last few hours: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/global-report-coronavirus-pandemic-not-over-warns-the-who\">World sees largest daily rise in cases</a>. </strong>The World Health Organization gave a stark warning on Wednesday that the coronavirus pandemic is far from over, after 106,000 new cases were recorded worldwide over the past 24 hours \u2013 the most in a single day so far. Speaking in Geneva, the WHO\u2019s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said the virus was spreading in poorer countries, just as wealthier nations were emerging from lockdown.</li> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/top-eu-doctor-europe-should-brace-itself-for-second-wave-of-coronavirus\">Europe should brace itself for a second wave of coronavirus infections</a></strong>, according to the director of the EU agency responsible for advising governments on disease control. \u201cThe question is when and how big. That is the question in my view,\u201d said Dr Andrea Ammon, director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.</li> \n   <li><strong>Trump considers an in-person G7 meeting despite coronavirus pandemic. </strong>Donald Trump has said he may seek to revive a face-to-face meeting of Group of Seven leaders near Washington, after earlier canceling the gathering due to the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cI am considering rescheduling the G-7, on the same or similar date, in Washington, DC, at the legendary Camp David,\u201d the US president tweeted on Wednesday. \u201cThe other members are also beginning their COMEBACK. It would be a great sign to all \u2013 normalization!\u201d</li> \n   <li><strong>International imports and exports have fallen to their lowest level for at least four years</strong>, according to World Trade Organization figures. Warning that there was little prospect of the downturn ending soon, the global authority on trade said it believed import and export activity would fall precipitously in the first half of 2020.</li> \n   <li><strong>Tourists will be welcomed back to Greece from 15 June</strong>, the prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, has announced. \u201cThe tourism period begins June 15, when seasonal hotels can reopen, and direct international flights to our tourist destinations will gradually begin 1 July,\u201d Mitsotakis said in a televised address.</li> \n   <li><strong>South Africa records its first neonatal coronavirus death. </strong>South Africa has recorded its first neonatal coronavirus death, the country\u2019s health ministry has said.The two-day old baby was born prematurely and had lung difficulties that required ventilation support immediately after birth, the health minister Zweli Mkhize said.</li> \n   <li><strong>France is to launch a complete shake-up of its health system</strong>, widely considered to be one of the best in the world, yet exposed by the pandemic. President Macron had already promised to overhaul the \u201csalaries, careers, speciality training and professional situation\u201d of staff, and to invest and reform financing of the health system.</li> \n   <li><strong>The arrival in Bangladesh of possibly the most powerful cyclone in more than a decade complicated coronavirus containment measures</strong>. Authorities were attempting to move 2.2 million people to safety as Cyclone Amphan made landfall on Wednesday morning, after days brewing in the Bay of Bengal.</li> \n   <li><strong>Amnesty International has urged governments to conduct urgent search operations to find as many as 1,000 Rohingya refugees</strong> who are stranded at sea and at risk of being hit by the cyclone. Rights groups said governments were using the pandemic as an excuse to turn away boats carrying stranded refugees, who may have been at sea for months.</li> \n   <li><strong>The Trump administration called on the UN to remove references to sexual health from its Covid-19 humanitarian response plan</strong>. In a letter to the UN secretary-general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the acting administrator for the US agency for international development, John Barsa, urged the UN to \u201cstay focused on life-saving interventions\u201d.</li> \n   <li><strong>The US president, Donald Trump, lashed out at Beijing, blaming it for \u201cmass worldwide killing\u201d</strong>. Trump referred to an unidentified \u201cwacko in China\u201d, in the latest in a series of attacks aimed at the country that he appears to be trying to frame as the centrepiece of his reelection bid.</li> \n   <li><strong>Oxfam International is to lay off almost 1,500 staff and close operations in 18 countries</strong> \u2013 including Afghanistan where it has worked for 50 years \u2013 after it emerged that the global aid organisation had been bleeding cash during the coronavirus crisis. The NGO has seen its funding model hit by an accumulation of crises.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n</div>",
  "<p>The US has declared its intention to leave the Open Skies Treaty, which is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/05/trump-administration-treaty-war-russia-withdraw\">intended to reduce the risk of war</a> by allowing Russia and western nations to conduct observation flights over each other\u2019s territory.</p> <p>Washington informed the other 33 parties to the treaty of its intention to deliver a formal six-month notice of withdrawal on Friday, accusing Russia of violations.</p> <p>\u201cI think we have a very good relationship with Russia, but Russia didn\u2019t adhere to the treaty, and so until they adhere to the treaty, we will pull out,\u201d Donald Trump told reporters. He added: \u201cThere\u2019s a very good chance we\u2019ll make a new agreement or do something to put that agreement back together.\u201d</p> <p>In a written statement, the secretary of state Mike Pompeo said the US could reconsider its withdrawal during the six month notice period \u201cshould Russia return to full compliance with the Treaty\u201d. Moscow denies being in violation of the agreement.</p> <p>By starting the six-month notice period now, the administration ensures that - even if Donald Trump loses the election in November \u2013 the US will have left the treaty before a Biden administration takes office.</p> <p>\u201cThe timing of the Trump administration\u2019s decision to withdraw is clearly tied to the political calendar,\u201d said Bob Menendez, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. \u201cBy rushing this abrupt withdrawal, it is clear the Trump Administration is attempting to bind a future administration from participation in this longstanding and valuable treaty for our nation.\u201d</p> <p>America\u2019s European allies are keen to keep the treaty going. They have benefited from the more than 1,500 overflights carried out under <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/05/trump-administration-treaty-war-russia-withdraw\">the OST</a>, allowing them to observe Russian military movements, and see it as a remaining element of international cohesion and transparency.</p> <p>\u201cThe writing has been on the wall for a long time,\u201d a European diplomat said, adding it was \u201cstill disappointing\u201d.</p> <p>The OST is the third arms control agreement Trump has left. He took the US out of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/08/iran-deal-trump-withdraw-us-latest-news-nuclear-agreement\">Iran nuclear deal in 2018</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/01/inf-donald-trump-confirms-us-withdrawal-nuclear-treaty\">Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces</a> treaty in 2019. There are fears for the future of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/01/us-senate-pushes-trump-to-safeguard-last-russian-nuclear-arms-control-treaty\">the last treaty limiting US and Russian strategic nuclear weapons</a>, New Start, which is due to expire in February next year, and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which the US has signed (observing a voluntary moratorium on nuclear tests) but not ratified.</p> <p>It is unclear how Russia will respond to US withdrawal. They will now be able to fly over US bases in Europe but the US will no longer be allowed to overfly Russia.</p> <p>Under the 2020 defence spending act, the administration is supposed to explain to Congress how leaving OST serves US security interests and give assurances that Washington has consulted its partners, 120 days before serving formal notice of withdrawal.</p> <p>\u201cReckless deal wrecking and the collapse of US leadership continues,\u201d Kingston Reif, director for disarmament and threat reduction policy at the Arms Control Association said.</p> <p>\u201cThe treaty benefits US and European security. Our allies value it and don\u2019t want us to leave. It has been an important tool for responding to Russia\u2019s aggression against Ukraine. This is a propaganda coup for Moscow.\u201d</p> <p>The US has complained about curbs that Moscow has imposed on overflights that have violated the accord. Russia limited the flight time of observation flights over the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad and set up an exclusion corridor along the border of the Russian-occupied regions of Georgia, South Ossetia and Abkhazia.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/europe-must-prepare-for-us-exit-from-vital-russia-treaty-former-nato-generals-warn\">Europe must prepare for US exit from vital Russia treaty, former Nato generals warn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cRealize the Russians were cheating,\u201d Tim Morrison, who was briefly the top arms control official in the Trump White House, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Tim_Morrison/status/1263512735385600004\">said on Twitter</a>. \u201cThey were misusing the treaty against the US \u2013 as senior military and civilian leaders warned.

The territory has long had a \u201cone country, two systems\u201d framework, but legal observers and human rights activists fear legislative change within China will undermine Hong Kong\u2019s legal framework. \u201cThe obvious worry is that in China, we have seen \u2018national security\u2019 \u2026 being used as an excuse for all sorts of human rights abuses, including the arbitrary arrest and imprisonment of dissidents,\u201d said Hong Kong barrister Wilson Leung.

  "<p>Britain and the US are facing calls to take some form of economic reprisal after China signalled that it was taking major steps to restrict civil liberties in Hong Kong <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/china-proposes-controversial-national-security-law-for-hong-kong\">by pushing through national security laws</a>.</p> \n<p>In an early sign of the British reaction, Lord Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong and a passionate critic of Chinese regime, called the move a \u201ccomprehensive assault on the city\u2019s autonomy, rule of law, and fundamental freedoms\u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/china-proposes-controversial-national-security-law-for-hong-kong\">'This is the end of Hong Kong': China pushes controversial security laws</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>He has recently written to the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, seeking assurances that the UK will not allow the Sino-British joint declaration to be torn up. The declaration, signed in 1985, made clear that Hong Kong\u2019s high degree of autonomy, rights and freedoms would remain unchanged for 50 years.</p> \n<p>In the US, Senator Ben Sasse, a Nebraska Republican on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, condemned Beijing\u2019s plans, accusing the Communist party of \u201ctrying to kill Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy\u201d and promising action if Beijing goes ahead.</p> \n<p>\u201cBeijing\u2019s current proposal will effectively destroy the rule of law in Hong Kong and will give Chairman Xi\u2019s thugs legal cover to treat freedom-loving protesters as terrorists,\u201d Sasse said in a statement.</p> \n<p>The chair of the House foreign affairs committee, Michael McCaul, warned: \u201cAny law passed by the CCP that further stifles the freedom of the people of Hong Kong would only further erode the foundations of One Country, Two Systems, and will not be tolerated by the United States.\u201d</p> \n<p>Donald Trump has been piling new trade restrictions on China in recent weeks, partly in response to the Chinese handling of the coronavirus outbreak. But Republican Senators called for Trump in the specific case of Hong Kong to change the former UK colony\u2019s preferential trading status. A US government determination of the special administrative region\u2019s \u201cautonomy\u201d is a precondition for continued US preferential trade and investment terms distinct from those applied to China. Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, has already said it will be difficult to declare the region autonomous in view of recent arrests of protesters.</p> \n<p>The US president seems determined to make the threat posed by the Chinese Communist party the defining issue in the campaign for November\u2019s presidential election, so may need little encouragement to impose new economic tariffs. Steve Bannon, his onetime political aide, said Trump\u2019s three election themes will be China, China, and China.</p> \n<p>On Thursday, Trump told reporters at the White House that \u201cnobody knows yet\u201d the details of China\u2019s plan. \u201cIf it happens, we\u2019ll address that issue very strongly,\u201d Trump said, without elaborating.</p> \n<p>Given the long history of bipartisan scepticism towards China in Washington, Democrats are unlikely to oppose any measures. Indeed, pro-democracy legislators in Hong Kong such as Claudia Mo are already expecting Trump to respond to China\u2019s actions. \u201cChina\u2019s move might just be considered savage by outsiders, and there could be a huge political price to pay internationally,\u201d she said. \u201cIs it worth it?\u201d</p> \n<p>The UK government, by contrast, has been involved in a balancing act.</p> \n<p>Tighter UK takeover laws are due to be published soon, but the UK Treasury does not believe decoupling between the west and China is in anyone\u2019s interest. The UK is also the No 1 foreign direct investment site for China in Europe, even if trade between Germany and China dwarfs that of the UK.</p> \n<p>Politically, the UK does not want to jettison China. Lord Hague, a former Conservative foreign secretary, said this month that there was no major challenge facing the world that could be solved without the cooperation of China. That applies especially to UN climate change talks, a process in which the UK has the diplomatic lead.</p> \n<p>The UK intelligence agencies have also made the judgment that Chinese-owned Huawei firm could be at the heart of the UK\u2019s new 5G network, without compromising national security, a decision that has led to heated phone calls between Trump and Boris Johnson.</p> \n<p>But the pressure to change tack is growing. Tom Tugendhat, chair of the foreign affairs select committee, said this week UK relations with China had reached \u201ca turning point\u201d. He argued: \u201cThe UK has a special duty to respond since China is now directly and incrementally challenging the international rules-based system.\u201d</p> \n<p>The UK, he said, was dealing with a very different China from the China of 2010. \u201cUp until a decade ago, we saw that increased wealth led to increased democratisation. Well, that is not so any more.\u201d</p> \n<p>Labour\u2019s Asia spokesman, Stephen Kinnock, has also adopted a more active and assertive position.<br><br>But the perennial question is what in practical terms can the UK do to resist a takeover in Hong Kong, apart from express outrage. Extending the British National Overseas Passport offer to Hong Kong citizens is the normal demand.</p> \n<p>In a muted letter to the foreign affairs select committee, Raab said: \u201cIf there is any attempt to include national security legislation before wider concerns with rights and freedoms in Hong Kong has been addressed satisfactorily, it could further unsettle the situation.\u201d</p> \n<p>The UK Foreign Office said: \u201cWe are following reports and monitoring the situation closely. We expect China to respect Hong Kong\u2019s rights and freedoms and high degree of autonomy. As a party to the joint declaration, the UK is committed to upholding Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy and respecting the \u2018one country, two systems\u2019 model.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>China plans to push through sweeping national security laws for Hong Kong at its annual meeting of parliament, in a move that critics say will effectively end the territory\u2019s autonomy.</p> \n<p>Beijing has been making it clear it wants new security legislation passed since huge pro-democracy protests last year plunged Hong Kong into its deepest turmoil since it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.</p> \n<p>\u201cNational security is the bedrock underpinning the stability of the country,\u201d said Zhang Yesui, spokesman for the National People\u2019s Congress (NPC), the annual meeting of parliament that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/china-prepares-to-stage-annual-congress-and-pretence-of-business-as-usual\">kicks off its full session on Friday</a>.</p> \n<p>Zhang announced that delegates at the NPC \u2013 a largely rubber-stamping exercise \u2013 would \u201cestablish and improve a legal framework and mechanism for safeguarding national security\u201d in Hong Kong.</p> \n<p>Condemnation of the proposal was swift, amid fears it could erase the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d framework that is supposed to grant the territory a high degree of autonomy.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is the end of Hong Kong,\u201d said pro-democracy Hong Kong legislator Dennis Kwok. \u201cBeijing, the Central People\u2019s Government, has completely breached its promise to the Hong Kong people ... They are completely walking back on their obligation.\u201d</p> \n<p>Article 23 of Hong Kong\u2019s mini-constitution, the Basic Law, says the city must enact national security laws to prohibit \u201ctreason, secession, sedition [and] subversion\u201d against the Chinese government.</p> \n<p>But the clause has never been implemented due to deeply held public fears it would curtail Hong Kong\u2019s cherished rights, such as freedom of expression.

The resolution is likely to be passed by China\u2019s parliament next week.</p> \n<p>The US president Donald Trump, who has ratcheted up his anti-China rhetoric as he seeks re-election in November, told reporters at the White House that \u201cnobody knows yet\u201d the details of China\u2019s plan. \u201cIf it happens we\u2019ll address that issue very strongly,\u201d Trump said, without elaborating.</p> \n<p>US State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus warned that imposing such a law would be \u201chighly destabilising, and would be met with strong condemnation from the United States and the international community\u201d.</p> \n<p>China\u2019s announcement came as anti-government protests that have overwhelmed Hong Kong since last June approach their first anniversary. In recent months the protests have been paused as a result of the coronavirus pandemic and much of the world has been distracted.

Chris Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong, described it as a \u201ccomprehensive assault on the city\u2019s autonomy\u201d.</p> \n<p>Under its Basic Law, Hong Kong is meant to enact security legislation on its own. \u201cThis spells the beginning of the end of Hong Kong under \u2018one country, two systems\u2019,\u201d said Kenneth Chan, a political scientist at the Baptist University of Hong Kong.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt would mean also communist-style political struggles have trumped the rule of law and a dagger that has stabbed into the heart of the city\u2019s liberal foundations,\u201d he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"9ba86514-c046-4e9c-b36f-2c1303e08d52\" data-atom-type=\"timeline\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Timeline\">\n    <p><i>(February 1, 2019)</i>&nbsp;<strong> </strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>A new Hong Kong extradition law is proposed, which would allow people to be transferred to mainland China for a variety of crimes.

Over the last year, Hong Kong and Chinese authorities have often described demonstrators as terrorists.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe obvious worry is that in China, we have seen \u2018national security\u2019, as well as related concepts like \u2018counter-terrorism\u2019, being used as an excuse for all sorts of human rights abuses, including the arbitrary arrest and imprisonment of dissidents, activists and human rights lawyers,\u201d said Wilson Leung, a Hong Kong barrister who is part of the Progressive Lawyers Group.</p> \n<p>According to legal experts, Chinese lawmakers may be able to enforce the law in Hong Kong through a provision, article 18, of the Basic Law that allows certain national laws in mainland China to be applied in Hong Kong, either through declaration or local legislation.</p> \n<p>Martin Lee, the founder of the Democratic Party and a senior barrister who helped draft the Basic Law, said he insisted on the language in the document that \u201cHong Kong shall legislate on its own\u201d national security laws.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is a blatant breach of their promise, they have reversed things completely,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the wrong procedure.\u201d</p> \n<p>He said the article 18 provision should apply to national laws only, not laws that specifically relate to Hong Kong. \u201cIf this precedent is set, then there is no need for [Hong Kong\u2019s] legislative council,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Eric Cheung, the director of clinical legal education of the faculty of law at the University of Hong Kong, said: \u201cThe problem here is that if they want to do it, of course they can do it in any way they want to. The reality is that we are powerless.\u201d</p> \n<p>As China\u2019s most important political event opens this week, after almost three months of delay, there are other signs of measures to stop the protests in Hong Kong. At the opening of the Chinese People\u2019s Political Consultative Conference on Thursday, Wang Yang, the head of the political advisory body, said the party supported strengthening the ability of its members in Hong Kong to \u201cspeak out, stop chaos, and reinstate order\u201d.</p> \n<p>Still, demonstrators, who have begun to take to the streets again, appeared more determined to pursue their demands.</p> \n<p>\u201cAt this time last year, didn\u2019t we believe that the extradition law was sure to pass? Hong Kongers have always created miracles,\u201d Nathan Law, a pro-democracy activist, wrote on Facebook.</p> \n<p>\u201cPeople will continue to protest on streets,\u201d tweeted Joshua Wong, an activist and former student leader during the 2014 protest movement. \u201cHong Kongers will not be scared off.\u201d</p> \n<p><em>Additional reporting by </em><em>Lillian Yang</em></p>",

But I went all the way in my 20s. And when the world started shutting down in the pandemic, elements of Moby-Dick surfaced in my mind like the leviathan breaching before the Pequod. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/24/andre-aciman-i-couldnt-finish-moby-dick-brilliant-but-i-lacked-the-patience-\">Andr\u00e9 Aciman: 'I couldn\u2019t finish Moby-Dick. I lacked the patience'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Something about my memories of Moby-Dick resonated with how I felt facing the unknowns of isolation, about what the months ahead might hold for the world while we watched the vainglorious president sacrifice his people in their tens of thousands and plunge America into darkness to sate his self-lust and stop-at-nothing fixation on re-election.</p> <p>The zeitgeist made me want to go full-journey into the frightening unknown again with Ishmael, Starbuck, Queequeg, Stubb, Flask and the rest of the eclectic, multicultural crew as they followed the equally monomaniacal Captain Ahab into his frightening abyss of revenge against Moby Dick.</p> <p>In 2008 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2008/dec/08/moby-dick-national-book\">Stephen Kinzer observed</a> that Moby-Dick was \u201can eerily prophetic allegory about 21st-century America. It is now truly the nation\u2019s epic\u201d. Kinzer cast White House incumbent George W Bush as Ahab and, as his whale, Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, revenge against whom no price in American lives and treasure seemed too expensive.</p> <p>Now Trump blames everyone else for his own manifest failings as man and president, his revenge worn most acutely by the legions of his dead and dying citizens.</p> <p>Those who haven\u2019t read the novel might have seen John Huston\u2019s 1956 movie with Gregory Peck as Ahab. Regardless, most know it doesn\u2019t end well as they sail into darkness, towards that spectacular moment of mutual destruction.</p> <p>Two months in, I\u2019m savouring the novel, reading a few pages daily as we sail closer to the moment of truth amid compelling digressions into cetology (the chapter on who\u2019s who in the whale world somehow remains, while wholly extraneous to plot and narrative, the stuff of writerly genius), ships, harpoons, sea ecology, the tension between the economy and environment \u2013 and extinction.</p> <p>This time round I\u2019ve found Ahab more disturbed and disturbing. Melville\u2019s characters \u2013 especially the crew \u2013 are more intriguing as the Pequod sails ever further from New Bedford\u2019s safe harbour. It\u2019s a fabulous slow-burn (654 pages plus illustrations), the tension rising and falling with the seas ventured.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Here, then, was this grey-headed, ungodly old man, chasing with curses a Job\u2019s whale round the world, at the head of a crew, too, chiefly made up of mongrel renegades, and castaways, and cannibals \u2013 morally enfeebled also, by the incompetence of mere unaided virtue or right-mindedness in Starbuck, the invulnerable jollity of indifference and recklessness in Stubb, and the pervading mediocrity in Flask. Such a crew, so officered, seemed specially picked and packed by some infernal fatality to help him to his monomaniac revenge.</p> </blockquote> <p>What could possibly go wrong? Read on ...</p> <p>Melville was generous \u2013 and compassionate \u2013 to his characters, not least the crew, whose portrayal defies the Darwinian racial mores of the day. They are all colours and, while America was when he wrote (and remains) divided on race, none were enslaved; free men sailing for themselves.</p> <p>Some say this is a book about everything and always one for the times, no matter what they might be (the Pequod encounters an epidemic). But perhaps timelessness is the true measure of a great novel. It\u2019s certainly about love, ballasted with the bromance or, perhaps, something more erotic, between Ishmael and Queequeg (the tattooed islander), whose hilarious first meeting occurs on a dark and stormy night in a double bed in a guesthouse for whalers.</p> <p>After an initial terror on encountering Queequeg, who\u2019d been out late trying to sell a human head, Ishmael muses:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I stood looking at him a moment. For all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean, comely looking cannibal. What\u2019s all this fuss I have been making about, thought I to myself \u2013 the man\u2019s a human being just as I am: he has just as much reason to fear me, as I have to be afraid of him. Better sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken Christian.</p> </blockquote> <p>A little later, \u201c ... he [Queequeg] pressed his forehead against mine, clasped me round the waist, and said that henceforth we were married; meaning, in his country\u2019s phrase, that we were bosom friends; he would gladly die for me, if need should be\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/may/16/great-beasts-and-american-exceptionalism-the-world-through-the-eyes-of-a-mammoth\">Great beasts and American exceptionalism: the world through the eyes of a mammoth</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Moby-Dick defeats many readers.

noticed an update today that includes exposure notifications.</p> \n  <p>This is the long-awaited Google-Apple API that we expect could be integrated into the Covidsafe app and fix a lot of the issues with the iPhone version of the app.</p> \n  <p>You won\u2019t be able to switch it on unless the government agrees to integrate the API into Covidsafe and agrees to all the privacy terms and conditions that come with that.</p> \n  <p>The app update issued last week did fix some of the problems that prevented people had closing the app and not recording Bluetooth handshakes, but this has had a side effect of causing more Bluetooth issues for other devices like fitness bands and wireless headphones.<br></p> \n  <p>That won\u2019t happen if the API is integrated because on the operating system level the phone is better at coordinating Bluetooth beacons around the other Bluetooth communications going on.</p> \n  <p>I asked Apple and Google this morning whether there were plans to integrate the API into the Covidsafe app and they couldn\u2019t say.<br></p> \n  <p>The ABC has reported the government is currently evaluating it.</p> \n  <p>It would fix a lot of the issues, and a change made by Apple, where you can now provide more info like phone numbers and upload keys to health providers for contact tracing, means it\u2019s much closer to Covidsafe now than it used to be.</p> \n  <p>One major difference still between the two is that the Apple API works out who is a potential person who was exposed to coronavirus on the phone while Covidsafe currently uploads every key to the server and works it out that way.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-21T07:38:27.462Z\">at 8.38am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div

After coming to power as the leader of a 1980 coup, Bouterse ruled as military dictator before adopting a behind-the-scenes role in the 1990s and 2000s.</p> <p>He was elected president in 2010, proving uniquely able to win support across the many ethnic groups that make up the former Dutch colony\u2019s population of half a million. He was re-elected at the head of his National Democratic party (NDP) with a smaller margin in 2015.</p> <p>Over his last decade in office, he has tried to delay and disrupt a legal case over his role in the 1982 murder of 15 prominent opposition members at Fort Zeelandia, a pink-brick fortified chateau in Paramaribo, the capital. But in December <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/30/suriname-president-guilty-of-over-1982-executions\">a military court found him guilty of murder</a>.</p> <p>He is appealing the decision and looks unlikely to see the inside of a cell, but the verdict marked a victory for the opposition.</p> <p>\u201cThat the president could be convicted by an independent court is a compliment to the independence of our justice system. It shows that no one is above the law,\u201d said Chan Santokhi, leader of the opposition Progressive Reform party (known by its Dutch initials VHP) \u2013 and a former chief of police who led the investigation into the murders.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"57c522fd887c0c74671fe54ce0672f452c293371\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57c522fd887c0c74671fe54ce0672f452c293371/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protestors demonstrate against corruption in the government of President Desi Bouterse in Paramaribo, Suriname on 17 February 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protestors demonstrate against corruption in the government of President Desi Bouterse in Paramaribo, Suriname, on 17 February 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ranu Abhelakh/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The criminal dealings of the Bouterse family are widely known.

In 2011 Bouterse granted a pardon to his foster son, Romano Meriba, who had been convicted in 2005 <a href=\"https://www.stabroeknews.com/2011/12/29/news/guyana/controversy-as-bouterse-grants-pardon-to-foster-son/\">of the murder of a Chinese trader and of throwing a hand grenade at the Dutch ambassador\u2019s residence</a>.</p> <p>Such scandals have not dented Bouterse\u2019s appeal. With the no-nonsense aspect of a heavyweight boxer and a melodious voice he deploys in man-of-the-people speeches and impressive Frank Sinatra renditions, Bouterse cultivates a lovable tough-guy image that has won him widespread popularity among working-class Surinamers.</p> <p>But if his persona reminded some of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/hugo-chavez\">Hugo Ch\u00e1vez</a> \u2013 who he considered a friend and ally until the Venezuelan president\u2019s death in 2013 \u2013 then so, too, did his fiscal profligacy and disdain for democratic institutions. He boosted social spending and doled out public sector jobs to allies even as gold and aluminium exports \u2013 the country\u2019s primary source of revenue \u2013 tanked.</p> <p>To cover the cracks, the government raised more than $1.5bn in Chinese loans, development finance and a $550m 10-year bond from Oppenheimer, a New York investment bank.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9ae2ec7b765c2742bd560ccfc4f065058f526a8c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ae2ec7b765c2742bd560ccfc4f065058f526a8c/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Supporters of Suriname\u2019s President Desi Bouterse (not pictured) react as he addresses them after appearing in court in Paramaribo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Supporters of Suriname\u2019s President Desi Bouterse (not pictured) react as he addresses them after appearing in court in Paramaribo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ranu Abhelakh/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It wasn\u2019t enough. The currency collapsed, the major credit ratings agencies devalued Suriname to junk status and by May, the Oppenheimer bonds were trading at 35% of their original price. According to Winston Ramautarsing, head of the Surinamese Society of Economists, 38% of government income goes to servicing debt. \u201cThe situation is unsustainable, we don\u2019t have enough income to pay local salaries and \u2013 having taken expensive loans from all over \u2013 we are now going to pay the true cost,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In February the situation came to a head when <a href=\"https://www.kaieteurnewsonline.com/2020/02/06/us100-million-vanishes-at-surinames-central-bank/\">a $100m hole in foreign currency reserves was discovered after the Central Bank</a> had ordered commercial banks to place 50% of deposits with them.</p> <p>\u201cWe warned the banks that the Central Bank was broke and not to be trusted \u2013 it hasn\u2019t published a report since 2014 \u2013 but they didn\u2019t listen, and the Central Bank used the savers\u2019 foreign exchange to cover the government\u2019s imports,\u201d said Ramautarsing.</p> <p>Suriname\u2019s long-term economic prospects could be brighter, however.</p> <p>In January international oil firms announced they had discovered offshore oil, leading to speculation that the reserves recently developed in Guyana could extend into Surinamese waters. If Bouterse can cling on to power, his next term could see billions of dollars of foreign investment.</p> <p>Until recently, however, that seemed unlikely. \u201cThe loss of purchasing power as a result of the weak currency has cost Bouterse a lot of middle-class support, particularly in the capital where opposition parties have grown rapidly\u201d said Hans Breeveld, a political analyst at Anton de Kom University in Paramaribo.</p> <p>But the Covid-19 pandemic has stalled the opposition\u2019s momentum. To date the country has had 11 confirmed cases of the coronavirus and one death, but a curfew and social distancing measures have been in place since 8 April, cutting off the sparsely populated forested inland regions from the coast.</p> <p>That has made it impossible for opposition groups to organize rallies<br>or reach inland areas. The pandemic has prompted to the EU to cancel its election observation mission, although the Organization of American States (OAS) will send a 10-person team.</p> <p>\u201cIn the interior you need just 700 votes for some seats, compared to 7,000 in the capital. There\u2019s been no oversight of what\u2019s happening in the interior and Bouterse\u2019s party has a history of using national funds for his campaigns,\u201d said Breeveld. </p> <p>Santokhi warned that a failure to oust Bouterse would have wider ramifications for the region.</p> <p>\u201cSurinamers have a choice between a better future or to become the next Venezuela\u201d he says. \u201cShould Bouterse retain power, the Caribbean region can expect to see economic refugees and cross border crime.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>You could spend a lifetime preparing to interview John Malkovich. For starters, there are his films, about 90 of them \u2013 mainstream, indie, European arthouse, schlocky, literary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/29/being-john-malkovich-charlie-kaufman-review\">self-referential</a>, lots of stinkers and a few classics. But he says he doesn\u2019t even like movies. So then there are his more esoteric projects: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/08/malkovich-malkovich-malkovich-catherine-edelman-chicago\">a </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/08/malkovich-malkovich-malkovich-catherine-edelman-chicago\">photography exhibition by Sandro Miller in which Malkovich recreated</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/08/malkovich-malkovich-malkovich-catherine-edelman-chicago\"> iconic portraits</a>, including Dorothea Lange\u2019s Migrant Mother; collaborations with classical musicians in which he reads out venomous critiques of the great composers. Finally, there is his real love \u2013 theatre. Fortunately, Malkovich doesn\u2019t expect you to have seen all his work. In fact, he gives the impression that he would be happy if you had seen none.</p> <p>I first interviewed him 27 years ago when he had just made <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107206/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0\">In </a><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107206/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0\">the Line of Fire</a> \u2013 a thriller in which he plays an assassin determined to kill the president (and which is one of his classics). He didn\u2019t mention the film once in our hour-long meeting. Today, he is supposed to be promoting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/ng-interactive/2018/mar/06/whats-on-netflix-and-amazon-this-month\">Space Force</a>, a Netflix comedy. Again, he doesn\u2019t mention it, until I ask at the end of our call. Instead, he talks about loss. All sorts of loss, from weight (shedding 32kg \u2013 5st \u2013 as a teenager) to hair to money \u2013 and even three siblings in their 50s. But, oddly, the more he talks about loss, in that hushed, melancholy voice, the more I begin to suspect he is one of life\u2019s unlikely optimists.</p> <p>Malkovich is 66, into his fifth decade in the film industry, and insists he has been winging it the whole time. \u201cI certainly never had a plan.\u201d Would it bother him if he never got another job offer? \u201cNo!\u201d He sounds positively enthused. \u201cIt would require a change in the way we live. But we already did that 12 years ago. So that would be fine.\u201d</p> <p>In December 2008, Malkovich lost his life savings. \u201cOur then business manager had invested pretty much everything we\u2019d ever made with somebody called Bernie Madoff.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jan/12/bernie-madoff-prison-life-ponzi-supernova-podcast-experience\">Madoff defrauded thousands of investors out of an estimated $64.8bn</a> and was given a 150-year jail sentence in 2009. \u201cEverything I\u2019d ever made was gone.\u201d</p> <p>Malkovich had been directing a play in Mexico City and had just returned to New York. \u201cI saw a picture of Bernie Madoff in handcuffs and said to my wife: \u2018I\u2019m going to go to the corner to get a packet of cigarettes. I think we have a little problem with Madoff.\u2019\u201d How did he feel? \u201cYou know, that was a couple of days of shock, I suppose.\u201d He tells the story with such languid insouciance that I initially assume it must be for effect \u2013 but I don\u2019t think it is. This is the real Malkovich.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b12278fb27bbbf8a3ef367278bb02c0c0df5a6f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b12278fb27bbbf8a3ef367278bb02c0c0df5a6f/0_0_3600_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Malkovich as Dr Adrian Mallory in Space Force\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The final frontier ... Malkovich as Dr Adrian Mallory in Space Force.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aaron Epstein/Netflix</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>How many millions did he lose? \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know. A lot. But I don\u2019t think it mattered that much. We just made changes to the way we lived and the money we spent.\u201d What changed? \u201cI had to do more work that paid for a number of years, and work all the time. And I stopped paying for everything. I just stopped paying for friends and family for a time. And we used to spend a lot of money producing movies that lost quite a lot of money. That stopped.\u201d</p> <p>Was he angry? \u201cNo. Not really. The first couple of days.\u201d Malkovich talks more slowly than anybody I know. Pretty much every word is accompanied by a pause. His language is flat and restrained \u2013 almost self-consciously untheatrical \u2013 even when telling the most dramatic stories. \u201cAfter a couple or three days, you go: \u2018You\u2019re lucky to be alive, you\u2019re lucky to have a job.\u2019 Almost no one has money in the banks. I read somewhere that a huge percentage of Americans wouldn\u2019t have $400 to put between their hands in an emergency.\u201d</p> <p>Malkovich grew up in a fairly privileged, but combustible, family in small-town middle America. His mother owned and edited the local paper in Benton, Illinois, and his father became an environmental journalist and activist. He grew up with three younger sisters and an older brother and has talked about the violence of his childhood \u2013 beatings from his father and his brother, Danny.</p> <p>Today, he says there was nothing remarkable about it. \u201cYou crossed the line and you got a beating. That was very common at that time. Sure, I had a lot of violence growing up, but so what?\u201d Is it true he would chase his brother with a butcher\u2019s knife? There is a long pause, even by Malkovich standards. \u201cMy brother didn\u2019t get anything he didn\u2019t deserve. That\u2019s not saying I didn\u2019t love him \u2013 he\u2019s gone now. He could be hilarious, very smart and extremely witty, but he was quite the torturer.\u201d Another pause. \u201cPeople get sick of being tortured.\u201d</p> <p>At the age of 16, he weighed 102kg (225lb) and was nicknamed Piggy. \u201cKids aren\u2019t very nice,\u201d he says. He went on a jelly-only diet and lost almost a third of his body weight. Yet even when he was mocked by his peers, he had style and self-belief. \u201cI used to play baseball and, when I was young, my father was my coach. He always said to me: if I cared about playing half as much as I cared about how I looked while playing, I could have been a very good baseball player.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"14024c9e8b1d8984dbb9a71c578c26117e2968d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/14024c9e8b1d8984dbb9a71c578c26117e2968d3/45_0_1165_1165/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Malkovich with Michelle Pfeiffer in 1988\u2019s Dangerous Liaisons.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Life imitates art ... starring in 1988\u2019s Dangerous Liaisons opposite Michelle Pfeiffer, with whom he had an affair.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Warner Bros</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In fact, Malkovich had wanted to become a professional pitcher. He only started acting because he fancied a girl in the drama group. Even then, his route into acting took detours. He drove a bus, dabbled in biology and sociology at college, then studied theatre at two universities in Illinois \u2013 dropping out of both. He moved to Chicago and became a founding member of the Steppenwolf theatre group, alongside Terry Kinney, Jeff Perry, and Gary Sinise (who directed and starred with Malkovich in Of Mice and Men).</p> <p>In its early years, the theatre\u2019s ensemble also included Glenne Headly, whom he later married, and Joan Allen. The latter said the young Malkovich, who dressed in an array of purples and long scarves, was a cross between Oscar Wilde and Franz Liszt. He was compared to Brando after he burned up the stage in Sam Shepard\u2019s True West in 1980.</p> <p>Four years later, he received an Oscar nomination for his first (non-extra) film part, playing a blind man in <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087921/\">Places In </a><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087921/\">the Heart</a>. <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094947/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0\">Dangerous Liaisons</a> made him a household name in 1988. His on-screen affair with Michelle Pfeiffer was replicated off screen and led to the collapse of his marriage to Headly. He ended up with neither woman and suffered a year-long depression. In 1989, he made <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100594/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0\">The Sheltering Sky</a> and fell in love with the second assistant director, Nicoletta Peyran, with whom he has been since.</p> <p>Slightly boss-eyed, balding by his early 20s, with legs like sequoias and an incipient belly, Malkovich made an unlikely leading man. But there was something about him \u2013 part brute, part beauty. He had grace, swagger, energy, sexuality. His contradictions made for a thrilling presence. The first time I met him, he gave a little bow when he introduced himself. He may have been 1.9 metres (6ft 2in) tall and heavily set, but he reminded me of a geisha.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I don\u2019t think anybody enjoys their family dying. I liked all mine. But what can you do? It\u2019s the final act in life</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In films, he has excelled at preening seducers. There are the obvious ones (the foppish predator Valmont in Dangerous Liaisons) and the less obvious (crazed Mitch Leary in In the Line of Fire is utterly bewitching). He can still be every bit as seductive today \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/sep/02/the-new-pope-review-john-malkovich-paolo-sorrentino-jude-law\">his fabulously vain John Paul III</a> in Paolo Sorrentino\u2019s classy TV series The New Pope is irresistible.</p> <p>Does he recognise himself in these characters? Not really, he says \u2013 apart from the vanity. \u201cMany of these characters are cold or cruel or intellectual.\u201d Is he cold in real life? He sounds hurt. \u201cMaybe shy sometimes. I don\u2019t think anybody who knew me would consider me cold. I may be wrong. And seducer the same \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t associate it with myself. Intellectual I wouldn\u2019t associate with myself. More class clown than any of that.\u201d</p> <p>He says he loves playing for laughs. One of my favourite Malkovich films is a little-known comedy called The Great Buck Howard, in which he plays a famous magician fallen on hard times. It is a gloriously hammy performance. He sounds delighted when I tell him. \u201cYeah, I enjoyed doing that immensely and am glad you noticed. I prefer to have fun.\u201d</p> <p>Really? There are so many stories of him being tough and intimidating, I say. \u201cI was athletic and I guess fairly strong in some ways, but don\u2019t consider myself tough; I don\u2019t consider myself someone looking for trouble.\u201d So these stories are apocryphal? Try me, he says. Well, what about the time you were mugged and ran home to get a knife, threw the mugger against a tree and said if he ever did it again he would be dead? \u201cIt\u2019s pretty apocryphal,\u201d he says. OK, the time you broke a bus window with your fist in temper? \u201cTrue. They wouldn\u2019t let me get on the bus.\u201d Were you in a lot of pain afterwards? \u201cI was, yes.\u201d</p> <p>Malkovich does bullying rage with aplomb on screen. He recently played a character based on Harvey Weinstein in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jun/19/bitter-wheat-review-malkovich-and-mamets-monstrous-misfire\">the David Mamet farce Bitter Wheat</a>. So many actors tell you they need to be able to sympathise with their characters, but Malkovich\u2019s isn\u2019t having any of that. \u201cI don\u2019t feel the need to be sympathetic. I didn\u2019t see much in that character to feel sympathetic with.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2d61284fc88ad82ad964b90793e5864842a4df55\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d61284fc88ad82ad964b90793e5864842a4df55/0_0_1873_2050/914.jpg\" alt=\"John Malkovich playing a version of himself in Being John Malkovich.\" width=\"914\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I don\u2019t consider it to be so much about me as about the nature of celebrity\u2019 ... playing a version of himself in Being John Malkovich.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext Collection/Sportsphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Was he shocked that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/harvey-weinstein-sentencing-rape-conviction\">Weinstein got a 23-year prison sentence</a>? \u201cI was shocked he even got a sentence. I don\u2019t know anybody who believed he would go to jail.\u201d He says it is too early to know whether the #MeToo movement has changed the culture of the film industry, but he hopes so. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible thing if somebody\u2019s job depends on what sexual favour they will give in return for work.\u201d Was that the culture? \u201cSure.\u201d</p> <p>Did he experience it first-hand? \u201cWhen I was young, I had a professor in the theatre department who made some advances that were unwanted. I was 19, he was in his 50s.\u201d Malkovich says he was lucky. \u201cI just said it wasn\u2019t my thing, sorry. It was someone I was fond of and I liked. So life went on. I did transfer schools, but not really because of that. The Weinstein situation is very different. It was transactional. It\u2019s terrible for women, but it\u2019s horrific also just for the idea of work.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps Malkovich\u2019s best-known film is Being John Malkovich \u2013 the brilliant absurdist comedy in which a puppeteer discovers a portal into the actor\u2019s head and then flogs tickets for it to the public. Malkovich plays Malkovich, or the Malkovich we think we know from his parts \u2013 serious-minded, arty, sleazy, with a volcanic temper. \u201cI don\u2019t consider it to be so much about me as about the future and about the nature of celebrity.\u201d He says that when he read the script, he loved it, but he asked the screenwriter, Charlie Kaufman, if he could direct it and Kaufman could make it about Tom Cruise. Kaufman gave him a firm no.</p> <p>For a number of years, Malkovich lived in France with his family (his children are 30 and 28). Now he is back in the US, living in Cambridge, Massachusetts, just outside Boston. Throughout lockdown, he has been at home with Peyran, now an academic, and their daughter, Amandine, who works in a grocery shop; his son, Loewy, is in Oregon, computer coding. No actors, then? \u201cOh, no!\u201d He sounds pleased.</p> <p>The actor has a reputation as a warmongering neo-con \u2013 he was in favour of invading Iraq and once said of the death penalty: \u201cI would have no problem pushing the switch while having dinner.\u201d But today he tells me he can\u2019t stand politics and hasn\u2019t voted since 1972\u2019s US presidential election, when he cast his ballot for the Democrat, George McGovern. \u201cI guess I think the system is pretty corrupt.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdpYpulGCKc\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bdpYpulGCKc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  <figcaption>The spoof is out there ... watch the trailer for Space Force.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Yet his latest project is a political satire. Created by the celebrated TV comedy writer Greg Daniels and Steve Carell, Space Force stars Malkovich as a slow-talking scientist alongside Carell\u2019s manic General Mark R Naird. It is uneven, but entertaining \u2013 part Dr Strangelove, part Veep, part soppy soap. Donald Trump has said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/may/16/spacewatch-nasa-wants-one-point-six-billion-dollars-next-year-to-get-astronauts-to-moon-by-2024\">he </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/may/16/spacewatch-nasa-wants-one-point-six-billion-dollars-next-year-to-get-astronauts-to-moon-by-2024\">wants to get astronauts back on the moon by 2024</a>, but Malkovich says the concept predates the president\u2019s ambition. Does he think it is a good idea to revisit the moon? \u201cI don\u2019t know. It might be a better idea than creating more lethal versions of viruses in labs,\u201d he says, gnomically. \u201cBut it may not be the best idea we\u2019ve ever had.\u201d </p> <p>I ask why he is working so hard these days \u2013 for the love or the money? Both, he says. \u201cI always love working.\u201d Again, he says, he has been lucky.</p> <p>But you have not always been lucky, I say \u2013 I was staggered to read that three of his four siblings (all of whom became journalists) died in their 50s. It must have been devastating, I say. \u201cYeah,\u201d he says. \u201cBut what can you do about it? Amanda, then Mother, then Danny, then Rebecca \u2013 and that was all over a five-year period from 2009.\u201d Did it prompt an existential crisis? \u201cNo. I try not to worry about things I can\u2019t control. Unless, say, you had a terrible mother, I don\u2019t think anybody enjoys their family or siblings dying. I liked all mine. But what can you do? It\u2019s the final act in life.\u201d</p> <p>It is unusual to find someone so accepting. Does he have a religion, a guiding philosophy? \u201cNot really,\u201d he says. He tells me a story \u2013 about shooting a film in a small town in Canada and being asked to talk to a little boy with leukaemia, whose hair had fallen out. \u201cThey wanted me to talk to him because people somehow think people in the movies have some power to do good. He was self-conscious about his hair, and I said: \u2018We\u2019ve got the same haircut,\u2019 and he said: \u2018Yes, but not for the same reason.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cAnd that is how I look at life; I was very lucky. I\u2019ve been luckier than anybody I know. Luckier than all of the children in my family, all of whom were more interesting or more talented or smarter than me. So when things have happened that have been sad and difficult, I don\u2019t feel the need to complain about them.\u201d</p> <p>So, in a way, that is a philosophy, I say \u2013 and a surprisingly positive one for someone who sounds so relentlessly downbeat. \u201cYeah!\u201d he says, with an audible surge of enthusiasm. \u201cI\u2019ve never been a negative influence. I think I\u2019m quite a positive person, all in all.\u201d</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/81021929\">Space Force</a> is available to stream on Netflix from 29 May</em></p>"
