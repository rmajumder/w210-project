It established a separate department for youth justice and announced initiatives to keep children out of detention and watch houses.</p> <p>Last month the government made an about-face policy pivot: it <a href=\"http://statements.qld.gov.au/Statement/2020/3/10/hard-line-on-youth-crime\">announced a new \u201chard line on youth crime\u201d approach</a> that aimed to place more children in detention. This was partly a response to vocal campaigning by local media in Townsville, where Labor seats are considered vulnerable at this year\u2019s state election.</p> <p>In its announcement, the government said it would take \u201ctougher action on bail\u201d including seeking to keep more children on remand, and a \u201cpolice blitz on bail\u201d to appeal court decisions.</p> <p>\u201cThese are changes our MPs in Cairns, Townsville, Rockhampton and the Gold Coast have advocated and the government has acted,\u201d the premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, said.</p> <p>This week, there are 223 children in youth detention centres; significantly up from late last year, when the initial youth justice reforms were starting to take effect.</p> <p>There are 258 youth detention beds in Queensland, but it is unclear whether these are all available, as ongoing expansion works at the Brisbane Youth Detention Centre had temporarily reduced its capacity, and these works are ongoing.</p> <p>Human rights advocates with knowledge of Queensland\u2019s youth detention system say the \u201csafe\u201d capacity of these centres is below the total bed numbers, as crowded facilities limit the ability of authorities to separate detainees of different ages and risk profiles.</p> <p>Crowding is often also considered a contributing factor to incidents in youth detention centres. On 18 March, a disturbance occurred at the Townsville centre that involved three boys climbing on to the roof.</p> <p>McDougall said the overwhelming majority of children in youth detention were from Aboriginal families, and many were accused of offences while living in unstable residential care arrangements.</p> <p>\u201cThe situation calls for intensive resources to be made available to Aboriginal controlled organisations to assist the safe return of children to Aboriginal families and kinship carers. Aboriginal voices need to be heard in the process of finding creative solutions to this pressing crisis.\u201d</p> <p>Concerns about \u201chard line\u201d policies disproportionately affecting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are heightened by the Covid-19 pandemic, and broad powers given to police to enforce public health regulations.</p> <p>Amnesty International Indigenous rights campaigner Lidia Thorpe said detention often took children out of safe environments with family.</p> <p>\u201cLocking them up is putting them at more risk, given we\u2019ve seen already this virus has got into prisons. Because of the overcrowding it puts kids or anyone at more risk of getting the virus.</p> <p>\u201cThe safest place for these kids is at home.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/feb/14/nsw-police-put-children-as-young-as-nine-many-of-them-indigenous-under-surveillance\">NSW police put children as young as nine, many of them Indigenous under surveillance</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Thorpe was critical of the government\u2019s youth crime shift, which she said fed into a narrative that promotes racist attitudes towards Aboriginal people.</p> <p>\u201cI think we have to keep in mind the Queensland election is coming up and unfortunately when we do have progressive governments in power, it becomes a race to the bottom on law and order. We\u2019ve seen this around the country where we\u2019ve had Labor governments in power.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s wrong to suggest that when we see a child misbehaving that the best thing for that is to lock them up and isolate them. If this was happening to non-Aboriginal kids we would see an outrage in this nation, but [because] it\u2019s happening to Aboriginal people it\u2019s like it\u2019s expected.\u201d</p> <p>The office of the state minister for child safety, youth and women, Di Farmer, said in March there were an average of seven young people a day held in police watch houses \u2013 down from 34 in March 2019 \u2013 and that the vast majority of those were waiting for a court hearing or processing.</p> <p>\u201cThe average number of days spent in a Queensland police watch house since January 2020 was two days, which reflects the significant transport arrangements required for transfer from remote and regional communities,\u201d a spokesman for the minister said.</p> <p>\u201cThe government is investing $177m in new youth detention centres beds, which includes the expansion of Brisbane Youth Detention centre with 16 new beds due to come online in May, and construction of a new 32-bed youth detention centre at Wacol.</p> <p>\u201cThis investment means state-wide capacity will increase from 258 beds to 306 beds by the end of this year.\u201d</p>",

Football isn\u2019t the same without fans \u2026 it is definitely better to play with fans than without fans.</p> <p>\u201cIt is still better to play the game behind closed doors and have it on TV, which is what the people need and want because it brings positive energy to their homes, than not playing at all. That\u2019s what the people want, that brings positive energy, and it will be July or August. We can\u2019t play it out in September or October.\u201d</p> <p>Pushed on whether the season could be abandoned totally, Ceferin said: \u201cIf the authorities do not allow us to play, then we cannot play.\u201d</p> <p>Uefa was forced to issue a statement on Sunday denying reported comments from Ceferin that the Champions League had to finish by 3 August.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not true,\u201d said the statement. \u201cThe president was very clear not to set exact dates for the end of the season.

The primary priority of all the members of the working group is to preserve public health.</p> <p>\u201cFollowing on from that, it is to find calendar solutions to complete all competitions. Options are currently being studied to play matches in July and in August if needed, depending on restart dates and the permission of national authorities.\u201d</p> <p>Ceferin also admitted that Uefa is considering postponing its Financial Fair Play regulations for at least a season given the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, although it is understood that Manchester City\u2019s appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport over their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/feb/14/manchester-city-banned-from-champions-league-two-seasons-ffp-uefa\" title=\"\">two-year ban</a> could still be conducted via conference call in May or June.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s definitely one of the possibilities,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to be flexible because the clubs are in deep financial problems.

  "<p>Joe Biden will wear a mask if he goes out in public, the former vice-president and probable Democratic presidential nominee said on Sunday.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> said on Friday he would not wear a mask, despite new guidelines issued by the White House that day \u2013 and announced from the Briefing Room podium by the president \u2013 for people to wear face coverings in public places.</p> <p>In an interview with ABC\u2019s This Week, Biden also defended his work as vice-president in the Obama administration in terms of preparing for such a pandemic.</p> <p>Trump has repeatedly sought to blame his predecessor for the federal government\u2019s slow and disjointed response to the arrival on US soil of Covid-19, the virus which by Sunday had infected more than 312,000 Americans and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/apr/05/coronavirus-map-us-latest-cases-state-by-state\">killed nearly 8,500</a>.</p> <p>At the White House on Friday, Trump told reporters \u201cthe [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] is advising the use of non-medical cloth face covering as an additional voluntary public health measure\u201d.</p> <p>But he added: \u201cThis is voluntary. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to be doing it.\u201d</p> <p>In an interview on ABC\u2019s This Week on Sunday, Biden, 77, sequestered at home in Wilmington, Delaware, was asked if he would wear a mask.</p> <p>\u201cYes,\u201d he said. \u201cLook, I think it\u2019s important to follow the science, listen to the experts do what they tell you.\u201d</p> <p>Trump, 73, said \u201cI just don\u2019t want to wear one myself\u201d and added that he was \u201cfeeling good\u201d.</p> <p>The wearing of masks is recommended as a way to stop people who have the virus but may not be showing symptoms from infecting others.</p> <p>Trump ploughed on: \u201cSomehow, sitting in the Oval Office behind that beautiful Resolute Desk, the great Resolute Desk, I think wearing a face mask as I greet presidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens, I don\u2019t know, somehow I don\u2019t see it for myself. Maybe I\u2019ll change my mind, but this will pass, and hopefully it will pass very quickly.\u201d</p> <p>Biden responded: \u201c[Trump] may not like how he looks in a mask but the truth of the matter is \u2026 follow the science. That\u2019s what they\u2019re telling us. So if I go out in public, and I have not gone to commercial places of late, I haven\u2019t gone to my local church \u2026 but my generic point is that you should follow the science.\u201d</p> <p>Biden also described preparations the Obama administration took to handle any pandemic, moves he said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Trump</a> had dismantled.</p> <p>\u201cWe did a lot to prepare,\u201d he said. \u201cAs you know \u2026 we set up a pandemic office within the White House, we expanded CDC in other countries so we could in fact, observe, see when things were coming, how things were moving.</p> <p>\u201cWe put people in China. I mean we did a whole lot of things, and they got a very detailed breakdown on this by a briefing, the Trump administration, when we transitioned out of office, but the president dismantled almost all of that and he drastically cut the budget for the CDC \u2026 so he didn\u2019t follow through on any of what we suggested was going to be a real problem.</p> <p>\u201cWe can do much better than [what is] being done now.\u201d</p> <p>Appearing on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, Jay Inslee, governor of Washington state where the virus first took hold on US soil, slammed Trump over the White House response.</p> <p>\u201cThis is ludicrous that we do not have a national effort in this,\u201d Inslee said. \u201cTo say [the federal government is] a backup\u201d \u2013 as Trump has repeatedly said this week \u201c\u2026Can you imagine if Franklin Roosevelt said: \u2018I\u2019ll be right behind you Connecticut, good luck building those battleships\u2019?</p> <p>\u201cIf he wants to be a wartime president, be a wartime president.

Capt Crozier was cheered from the ship but on Saturday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Trump</a> criticized him for writing the letter.</p> <p>\u201cI thought it was terrible what he did, to write a letter,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a class on literature. This is a captain of a massive ship that\u2019s nuclear-powered.\u201d</p> <p>The defense secretary, Mark Esper, told CNN\u2019s State of the Union on Sunday \u201cthere is an investigation ongoing\u201d but repeated that he supported the decision to fire Crozier because Thomas Modly, the acting navy secretary, had lost confidence in him.</p> <p>\u201cWhen all those facts come to bear we\u2019ll have a chance to understand\u201d why the decision was taken, Esper said.</p> <p>Esper also dismissed <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/04/04/trump-wants-him-fired-inside-ouster-capt-brett-crozier/\">reports</a><strong> </strong>that, as the Washington Post put it, Modly \u201ctold one colleague [on] Wednesday, the day before he announced the move: \u2018Breaking news: Trump wants him fired\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Biden said it was \u201cclose to criminal the way they\u2019re dealing with this guy. The idea that this man stood up and said what had to be said, got it out that his troops, his navy personnel were in danger \u2026 Look how many have the virus.</p> <p>\u201cI think he should have a commendation rather than be fired.\u201d</p> <p>Esper also appeared on ABC, where he said US military personnel would soon be required to wear masks on duty.</p>",

Asked about DeSantis\u2019s prevarication, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/490562-surgeon-general-coronavirus-guidelines-represent-national-stay-at-home-order\">Adams responded</a> by quoting Trump\u2019s extension of social distancing measures the night before: \u201cMy advice to America would be that these guidelines are a national stay-at-home order.\u201d</p> <p>The message was unmistakable. Trump and DeSantis spoke again by phone later on Wednesday morning, and by mid-afternoon, with the state\u2019s coronavirus death toll ticking above 100 for the first time, <a href=\"https://www.flgov.com/wp-content/uploads/orders/2020/EO_20-91.pdf\">Florida executive order 20-91</a> was published. DeSantis said on Thursday on Fox News that the U-turn \u201cwas the right thing to do\u201d because of the Trump extension.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a governor who does not believe he serves the people of Florida but rather kowtows to the president of the United States,\u201d Donna Shalala, a congressional representative for Miami who was the US secretary of health during Bill Clinton\u2019s administration, told reporters on Thursday morning.</p> <p>The delay in publishing the order, she added, had been a critical miscalculation. \u201cHe hesitated and hesitated and hesitated. He has put us in a dangerous situation. Numerous people will die because our governor hesitated,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The question now is what consequence the order will have, and whether it has come too late to significantly alter experts\u2019 predictions of a spike in deaths in Florida. On Thursday the University of Washington\u2019s institute for health was still predicting cases in the state would <a href=\"https://covid19.healthdata.org/projections\">crest in early May</a>, but increased its projected peak daily death toll from 136 to 175, a rate that would lead to about 7,000 deaths by mid-June.</p> <p>\u201cWe are trying to plan for a tsunami on the horizon that everybody is hoping is going to miss our island but is bearing straight down on us,\u201d said Dr Kayser Enneking, professor of anesthesiology at the University of Florida\u2019s department of medicine.</p> <p>\u201cThe response we\u2019ve seen from the state and federal governments has been based not on science but the gut of our leaders. The number of cases in Florida is on the exponential rise, but the lack of testing has impacted our ability to predict where we are in this crisis.\u201d</p> <h2>State was \u2018woefully underprepared\u2019</h2> <p>The picture is also muddled over the medical supplies and equipment Florida says it will need. Last Sunday, Trump insisted that the state\u2019s wishlist, including 5,000 ventilators, half a million each of gloves and gowns, and 2m N95 face masks, had been met from federal supplies. \u201cFlorida has been taken care of,\u201d the president promised. \u201cI looked, they\u2019re very aggressive in trying to get things done and they\u2019re doing a very good job.\u201d</p> <p>But by the following afternoon Jared Moskowitz, appointed by DeSantis as Florida\u2019s director of emergency management last year, had resorted to Twitter, frustrated by failed efforts to bring more masks to the state and lamenting a lack of a federal allocation system.</p> <p>\u201cIt feels like a Ponzi scheme,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JaredEMoskowitz/status/1244808519465029632\">he wrote</a>, referring to the third-party distribution scheme for equipment <a href=\"https://www.3m.com/3M/en_US/company-us/all-3m-products/~/All-3M-Products/Consumer/Personal-Safety/Masks-Respirators/?N=5002385+8709316+8710670+8710839+8711017+8735361+3294857497&amp;rt=r3\">manufactured by 3M</a>. \u201cDifferent distributors represented by brokers selling the same lot of masks bidding against each other.

We went through those in two days. We just received another thousand, and we\u2019ll get through those in two days as well,\u201d she said.</p> <p>She was, however, reluctant to place the blame solely on DeSantis: \u201cIt\u2019s the first time this governor\u2019s been through it. What a hell of a test this is.\u201d</p> <p>George Moraitis, chair of Broward county\u2019s Republican party, was even more generous. \u201cGovernor DeSantis is under the microscope but he\u2019s excelling,\u201d he wrote in a <a href=\"https://www.sun-sentinel.com/opinion/commentary/fl-op-com-moraitis-desantis-leadership-coronavirus-20200331-sohazgf4zzcljcknwnfyll27qe-story.html\">Sun-Sentinel op-ed</a>. \u201cHe is leading Florida through the Covid-19 outbreak with measured, informed and effective actions to protect both the health and the fundamental rights of all Floridians.\u201d</p> <p>Evan Jenne, co-leader elect of Florida\u2019s House Democrats, told the Guardian<em> </em>that further down the line he would call for a legislative select committee to evaluate the actions of DeSantis and his administration throughout the crisis.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to know what went right and what went wrong. I have a feeling that both of those will be long lists,\u201d he said. DeSantis\u2019s decree, however, will appear firmly in the second category, in Jenne\u2019s view, not least because it exempts churches and places of worship.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an executive order with holes big enough you could drive an 18-wheeler through it. Mass meetings of worshipping folks are perfectly fine, and that\u2019s not going to help,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cAt no point in our nation\u2019s history has human sacrifice ever been an acceptable form of worship and you\u2019re potentially going to kill someone, if not put them through respiratory hell.

The Cubs were famously inept. Generations of fans at their historic, ivy-clad Wrigley Field had witnessed nothing but failure and underachievement since their last World Series victory in 1908. Even the White Sox, their cross-city rivals, managed a World Series win in 2005 having started the season as 66-1 shots, but the Cubs\u2019 drought moved beyond a century with no sign of any relief.</p> <p>But just a year adrift of Gale\u2019s absurd prediction, in 2016, the Cubs made it through to the World Series for the first time since 1945. They were up against the Cleveland Indians who, in a nice twist, had the second-longest championship drought \u2013 a mere 68 seasons, compared to the Cubs\u2019 108. When the Indians jumped to a 3-1 series lead, including consecutive wins at Wrigley Field in its 100th year, for Cubs fans, all hope once again seemed lost.

It felt like an escape to step from bright California afternoon sunshine into the welcoming darkness of a sports bar in Pasadena as the teams warmed up more than 2,000 miles away to the east.</p> <p>The bar was already packed in anticipation, with Cubs fans outnumbering those rooting for Cleveland by at least 10 to one.

The Indians tied it in the third, went 3-1 down in the next and 5-1 down by the middle of the fifth. No sooner had Cubs fans started to believe than Cleveland roared back, with two runs to make it 5-3.</p> <p>It was 6-3 Cubs by the middle of the eighth, a three-run cushion with six outs needed for victory. But baseball is a sport like few others, since a single swing of the bat can score one, two, three or even four runs to turn a game on its head. With the score back to 6-4 in the bottom of the eighth and a runner on second, Rajai Davis hit a home run that tied the game at 6-6. For the fifth time in history, Game 7 of the World Series was going to extra innings.</p> <p>And then, it started to rain, delaying the finale for almost half an hour. So it was past midnight in Cleveland when Michael Mart\u00ednez came to the plate, nearly four and a half hours after the first pitch, with two men out, a runner on first and the Cubs 8-7 in front.

  "<p>I\u2019m going to tell you the single worst story I\u2019ve heard in these past few horrid months, a story that combines naked greed, political influence peddling, a willingness to endanger innocent human beings, utter blindness to one of the greatest calamities in human history and a complete disregard for the next crisis aiming for our planet. I\u2019m going to try to stay calm enough to tell it properly, but I confess it\u2019s hard.</p> <p>The background: a decade ago, beginning with indigenous activists in Canada and farmers and ranchers in the American west and midwest, opposition began to something called the Keystone XL pipeline, designed to carry filthy tar sands oil from the Canadian province of Alberta to the Gulf of Mexico. It quickly became a flashpoint for the fast-growing climate movement, especially after Nasa scientist James Hansen explained that draining those tar sands deposits would be \u201cgame over\u201d for the climate system. And so thousands went to jail and millions rallied and eventually Barack Obama bent to that pressure and blocked the pipeline. Donald Trump, days after taking office, reversed that decision, but the pipeline has never been built, both because its builder, TC Energy, has had trouble arranging the <a href=\"https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/energy/article/TC-Energy-sells-assets-to-help-fund-Keystone-XL-14069033.php\">financing</a> and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-keystone-pipeline-spill-permit/rare-permit-for-keystone-oil-pipeline-in-spotlight-after-spills-idUSKBN1XI0L0\">permits</a>, and because 30,000 people have trained to do nonviolent civil disobedience to block construction. It\u2019s been widely assumed that, should a Democrat win the White House in November, the project would finally be gone for good.</p> <p>And then came the coronavirus epidemic \u2013 and the oil industry saw its opening. It moved with breathtaking speed to take advantage of the moment.</p> <p>In Alberta, premier Jason Kenney, a pliant servant of the oil companies who had already set up a <a href=\"https://www.macleans.ca/news/canada/what-is-jason-kenneys-energy-war-room-good-for/\">\u201cwar room\u201d</a> to fight environmentalists, <a href=\"https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/tc-energy-to-proceed-with-keystone-xl-pipeline-after-1-5b-investment-from-alberta-government\">invested</a> $1.1bn of taxpayers\u2019 money to TC Energy to fund construction through the year, and set aside another $6bn in a <a href=\"https://business.financialpost.com/commodities/energy/tc-energy-to-proceed-with-keystone-xl-pipeline-after-1-5b-investment-from-alberta-government\">loan guarantee</a>.</p> <p>Meanwhile, on the southern side of the border, a series of states quickly adopted laws making it a felony to protest \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d like pipelines. (Last week South Dakota, a crucial link on the KXL route, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/489960-three-states-push-criminal-penalties-for-fossil-fuel-protests-amid\">made it a felony</a> even to \u201cincite\u201d such protest.) And the Department of Health and Human Services issued a <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/CISA_Guidance_on_the_Essential_Critical_Infrastructure_Workforce_Version_2.0_Updated.pdf\">memorandum</a> exempting pipeline construction from stay-at-home orders because such work was \u201c<a href=\"https://www.glasgowcourier.com/story/2020/03/25/news/kxl-to-go-forward-in-midst-of-pandemic/8657.html?fbclid=IwAR3XkPugyurel_uSz86nG7Zt6eexJ_HLZNBufOWTNas8kDmJyby5UpQpe5I\">critical</a>\u201d \u2013 that is, the department is asserting it is essential to build oil pipelines at the precise moment that the world is swimming in oil and that the Trump administration is boasting about getting Saudi and Russian autocrats to <em>cut</em> supply.</p> <p>On Tuesday, TC Energy announced it was <a href=\"https://www.glasgowcourier.com/story/2020/04/01/news/kxl-to-go-forward-amid-pandemic/8663.html\">moving workers</a> from across America into place in states along the pipeline route \u2013 although local reporters in Montana discovered they\u2019d <a href=\"https://www.glasgowcourier.com/story/2020/03/25/news/kxl-to-go-forward-in-midst-of-pandemic/8657.html\">actually begun arriving</a> 48 hours earlier, narrowly beating the state imposition of a quarantine.</p> <p>On Thursday, JP Morgan Chase announced that it was leading a <a href=\"https://www.ran.org/press-releases/reckless-keystone-xl-decision-backed-by-chase-citi-and-banks/\">$1.25b</a><a href=\"https://www.ran.org/press-releases/reckless-keystone-xl-decision-backed-by-chase-citi-and-banks/\">n bond issue</a> for TC Energy.</p> <p>So here\u2019s how it shakes out:</p> <p>1) The oil industry is flying in workers from across America to rural states with already strained health care systems, at a moment when all Americans have been asked to shelter in place, and pretending that they are \u201cessential\u201d employees in order to build a pipeline that would carry oil no one wants or needs, and which would go a long way toward wrecking the planet\u2019s climate system.</p> <p>2) The work is being done on the <a href=\"https://www.narf.org/cases/keystone/\">edges of many Indian reservations</a> \u2013 endangering a group of people who, over the centuries, have <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/gunsgermssteel/variables/smallpox.html\">endured</a> 90% population losses from introduced epidemics, and who are suffering horrible losses already from this one. As Faith Spotted Eagle of the Yankton Sioux <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/in-the-midst-of-the-coronavirus-pandemic-construction-is-set-to-resume-on-the-keystone-pipeline\">put it</a> on Wednesday, \u201cthis causes eerie memories for us [of] the infected smallpox blankets that were distributed to tribes intentionally\u201d.</p> <p>3) It is difficult to escape the conclusion that the oil industry is acting decisively now because it knows this is the one moment when protesters can\u2019t make themselves heard. Those 30,000 trained volunteers represent one of the great nonviolent armies in American history, willing to suffer to protect the planet \u2013 but they are moral human beings who will not risk taking microbes into prisons with them, and endanger prisoners crowded together in impossible conditions.</p> <p>There are plenty of targets for anger \u2013 timid Democrats like Montana governor Steve Bullock, who could delay the construction, or like Joe Biden, who could have made it clear that the pipeline would be shut if he won, but who instead issued a statement to NPR which should be eligible for the mealy-mouthed hall of fame:</p> <p><em>\u201cVice-</em><em>president Biden supports establishing a process requiring that for any significant infrastructure project \u2013 including all pipelines \u2013 there must be a full review and accounting of the impact on climate, local environmental health</em><em> and climate justice before any project can proceed. Vice-</em><em>president Biden believes that the approach Secretary Kerry applied in analyzing the costs and benefits of the Keystone XL pipeline and other cross-border pipelines \u2013 including to national security and diplomacy \u2013 is a model to build from in establishing this process.\u201d</em></p> <p>But let\u2019s be clear: the villains here are the oil industry and the big banks. And let\u2019s further be clear: their villainy is not new. The oil industry knew about and lied about climate change for 30 years: they\u2019ve prevented us from flattening the carbon curve, and set up a tragedy far greater even than coronavirus and one which will play out for decades to come. And the banks are their invaluable allies: Chase Bank has <a href=\"https://www.ran.org/bankingonclimatechange2020/\">lent $268b</a><a href=\"https://www.ran.org/bankingonclimatechange2020/\">n</a> to the industry since the Paris climate accords \u2013 what\u2019s another billion to build a useless pipeline and perhaps spread a fatal disease?</p> <p>Literally nothing matters to these people except money. Even in a moment when the rest of us are changing our every habit to try and protect each other, they are willing to sacrifice nothing. No \u2013 let\u2019s be clear again. In this moment they are using the cover of the pandemic to make yet more money, to do things they could not get away with at any other time. These aren\u2019t penny-ante price gougers trying to corner the local market in hand sanitizer so they can make a buck \u2013 these are cold-blooded and calculating members of the one percent. It\u2019s so over-the-top evil that it\u2019s like the comic book version of Naomi Klein\u2019s Shock Doctrine, written in blood.</p> <p>I am a Methodist, sometimes a Sunday School teacher. I don\u2019t actually believe in hell \u2013 I think God is capable of forgiving people for the worst things. But I don\u2019t think I am.</p> <p>Though the hour is late, there may still be ways to fight this blitzkrieg. The coalitions that have battled it for a decade are, even forced apart by the microbe, now coming together to try.

He looks uncannily like my best friend\u2019s dad, who kind of raised me and is a wonderful person but, if [he] got mad at you, you felt pretty shitty. I think that helped: very strong Pavlovian response already built in! And he\u2019s [Patinkin] just very good at what he does. Our partnership grew and deepened over time.\u201d</p> <p>When Danes and Patinkin filmed their final scene together, the end of <em>Homeland</em> truly sank in. She recalls: \u201cIt\u2019s not a casual scene. I think for me that was my cathartic moment when I realised it was over, because to say goodbye to it in its entirety is just too abstract and too huge.

I was really struck by their patriotism, that people make profound sacrifices on behalf of our country. I took that very seriously.\u201d</p> <p>Adapted for the US Showtime network from Gideon Raff\u2019s Israeli series <em>Prisoners of War</em>, <em>Homeland</em> exploded into life in 2011, when water-cooler television was still a thing and a company called Netflix was working on its first original programme, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/house-of-cards\">House of Cards</a></em>. Presumed dead, US marine sergeant Brody turns out to have been held as a prisoner of war by al-Qaida for eight years. He returns to America and a hero\u2019s welcome. But CIA officer Mathison can see something no else does: that Brody has been turned and is now a double agent poised to attack America. She sounds the alarm but is not believed \u2013 in part, because of her bipolar disorder. And then she and Brody have a fling.</p> <p>The first series dazzled critics, gained fans including Barack Obama and won Emmy awards for best lead actress, lead actor, drama series and writing for drama series. Season two maintained the momentum, including an audacious, much-praised episode in which Mathison interrogates Brody at great length.</p> <p>But in a recent <em>Los Angeles Times</em> interview, Gansa said \u201cit became much more difficult to write the show\u201d after that episode. A subplot in which Brody again becomes a double agent was \u201cstrained\u201d. The series indulged twists and turns that stretched credulity, and was in danger of \u201cjumping the shark\u201d. \u201cWhere Did <em>Homeland</em> Go Wrong?\u201d demanded the <em>New Yorker</em> magazine.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d0f9cddbe6492ca8ab2b8fde5610452d8649f18d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d0f9cddbe6492ca8ab2b8fde5610452d8649f18d/0_0_4824_3656/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Damian Lewis in season one, 2011.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"758\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">With Damian Lewis in season one, 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Moviestore/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The radical solution, apparently against Showtime\u2019s wishes, was amputation: Brody was killed off, publicly hanged from a crane in Tehran as punishment for killing the head of Iranian intelligence, with Mathison watching in horror.</p> <p>It was a chance for <em>Homeland</em> to start over. The team began attending an annual \u201cspy camp\u201d at the City Tavern Club in Georgetown, Washington DC, absorbing the accumulated insights and knowledge of current and former intelligence agents, diplomatic old hands and, one year, National Security Agency (NSA) whistleblower <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/the-nsa-files\">Edward Snowden</a>.</p> <p>Speaking by phone, one of the participants in these brainstorming events, Michael Hayden, former director of the CIA and NSA, recalls: \u201cA lot of times it was, \u2018OK, what\u2019s happening now?\u2019 We talked about that and then they talked about whichever plot they were thinking about. It was a conversation. We then went to dinner and talked about it again. It\u2019s interesting, because the more we did it, the more they had our kind of questions.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>America\u2019s response to 9/11 was not great. We didn\u2019t identify the real source of conflict and we were too reactionary</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Danes has fond memories of the spy camps. \u201cThe days were long and dense,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019d meet at nine and the revolving door was in constant motion, depositing one story and then another, and they were often told by people who had very different ideologies and political positions. It was a huge privilege because you really did get to look into a crystal ball from all these amazing sources and get a fairly clear picture of what our reality might be like in a year\u2019s time.\u201d</p> <p>Were there any surprises? \u201cWhen we first started the show, I didn\u2019t realise that Russians were a potentially difficult relationship. I thought we had worked through that! It\u2019s also just a shock that these people actually exist. I was interested in how that would inform a person\u2019s emotional makeup or their intimate relationships. You hear stories of people working [together] in really volatile posts for years on end and then they come home and separate: the adrenaline is gone. What it is to be so isolated, to carry all of those secrets, be shape-shifting, assuming different identities\u2026\u201d</p> <p>This brains trust helped <em>Homeland</em> take a new, more self-questioning direction. The first episode of season four was entitled \u201cThe Drone Queen\u201d, with Mathison in Kabul, Afghanistan, as the CIA\u2019s youngest ever station chief. She gives the go-ahead for a military strike on a wedding in Pakistan, killing dozens of innocent civilians.</p> <p>Season five shifted to Berlin, with Mathison having quit the CIA to work for a German billionaire philanthropist who, at one point, upbraids Berenson: \u201cNothing has made the world more dangerous than the foreign policy of the United States.\u201d The series also kept bumping up against real events. The crew was filming in Berlin just after the November 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris. </p> <p>Season six (early 2017) was even more spookily prescient on themes of fake news, Russian election interference and a president-elect at loggerheads with the intelligence community. It premiered five days before the inauguration of Trump, whose bellicose attacks on the FBI, CIA and so-called \u201cdeep state\u201d appalled Danes.</p> <p>\u201cWe worked with the intelligence community over the years, and I\u2019ve been playing somebody within it. It was hard not to feel real empathy and deep appreciation and loyalty. So when suddenly they were dismissed and undermined by a president, it was just so hard to believe.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ba42572a86c7ab0a70f952c30d06fc476d29134f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ba42572a86c7ab0a70f952c30d06fc476d29134f/0_103_3000_1799/1000..jpg\" alt=\"F Murray Abraham and Maury Sterling in Homeland season six, which predicted Russian election interference.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">F Murray Abraham and Maury Sterling in Homeland season six, which predicted Russian election interference.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: 20th Century Fox/JoJo Whilden/Showtime</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The final season has again given a voice to outside critics of American adventurism abroad, and again mirrored real events, this time with a president winding down the country\u2019s longest war, in Afghanistan. While there, Mathison is confronted by multiple gravestones bearing the same date of death, the consequence of her own past actions. And she comes full circle to find herself in Brody\u2019s shoes, under suspicion for possibly having been turned by a foreign adversary.</p> <p><em>Homeland\u2019s</em> politics remains complex and problematic. Some argue that, in the later years, it sought redemption. Did Danes observe a conscious tilt to the left? \u201cI don\u2019t know if we were editorialising too much,\u201d she says. \u201cI think we were really just charting that curve. Our [America\u2019s] response to 9/11 was not great. We didn\u2019t identify the real source of danger and conflict and we were too reactionary and we betrayed a lot of our values because of the panic we were in.</p> <p>\u201cSo we kind of learned that as we went along. When I was talking to Alex [Gansa] about the final season, he framed it in a way that was helpful. He said when we first started telling our story, it was directly to do with our response to 9/11, and nearly a decade later we\u2019re wondering if we\u2019ve in fact learned anything, if we would react differently.</p> <p>\u201cHe simulated an event that would sort of be comparable in scale, as traumatising and as consequential, which is the president\u2019s helicopter going down. That was a litmus test. How do our characters in this story interpret that? Do they pause and judiciously consider their next move or do they go straight into offensive mode, a fear-based mode?\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/video/2015/oct/15/graffiti-artist-explains-why-he-daubed-homeland-is-racist-on-shows-set-videso\"            data-short-url=\"https://gu.com/p/4dbg8\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2390102\"            data-video-name=\"Graffiti artist explains why he daubed \u2018Homeland is racist\u2019 on show\u2019s set \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"BBC World Service / Outside Source\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/10/15/1444921887320/KP_545777_crop_640x360.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-561fc22ae4b01867c5abe709\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/10/15/1444921887320/KP_545777_crop_640x360.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/10/15/151015Homeland_KP-25759561_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/10/15/151015Homeland_KP-25759561.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2015/10/15/151015Homeland_KP-25759561_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2015/10/15/151015Homeland_KP-25759561_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2015/10/15/151015Homeland_KP-25759561_synd_768k_vp8-2.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/video/2015/oct/15/graffiti-artist-explains-why-he-daubed-homeland-is-racist-on-shows-set-videso\">Graffiti artist explains why he daubed \u2018Homeland is racist\u2019 on show\u2019s set</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>One of the most enduring criticisms of the series is its portrayal of Muslims. Under the headline \u201cHomeland is the most bigoted show on television\u201d, writer and film-maker Laura Durkay wrote in the <em>Washington Post</em> in 2014: \u201cSince its first episode, <em>Homeland</em> has churned out Islamophobic stereotypes as if its writers were getting paid by the cliche.\u201d</p> <p>The following year, Arab graffiti artists who had been hired by the producers to add realism to the set of Syrian refugee camp wrote: \u201cHomeland is racist.\u201d No one noticed and translated it until the episode was broadcast. It was, one comedian observed, a major intelligence failure. Danes acknowledges: \u201cThat was a good stunt. All of our hats were off to them.\u201d</p> <p>On the broader issue, she says: \u201cI get it. I think it\u2019s tricky and kind of inherently problematic, right? There are a lot of brown people in our story who are doing really bad things, and there aren\u2019t enough opportunities to create a more balanced portrait of that demographic. That was always going to be a point of vulnerability for us, but I also think that our heroes are really problematic and really flawed. We\u2019re wrestling with some pretty challenging questions and ideas and those two sides of various arguments were personified by our characters.</p> <p>\u201cIn most cases I think both characters were right. Our writers were fairly responsible about that, creating a real debate. In the first episode of this season we have the Palestinian politician who\u2019s really challenging Saul and making credible, cogent points about the ways that America has failed. I was happy about that at least.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fd256b073f6321f7f29ed6dc3ab69dc14d49cff1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd256b073f6321f7f29ed6dc3ab69dc14d49cff1/0_0_1920_1153/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Danes in the final season of Homeland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Danes in the final season of Homeland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sifeddine Elamine/Showtime</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Another sensitive area has been <em>Homeland\u2019s</em> portrayal of bipolar disorder. But Danes received positive feedback from people with the disorder. \u201cThey\u2019ve been mostly appreciative, which I feel great relief about and gratitude for. That condition is not dramatised all that often so I think any conversation that\u2019s stimulated by it is welcome. I never wanted her being bipolar to be a gimmick or just a convenient plot device, and I tried to be as specific and informed as possible. It\u2019s a really fascinating human condition. I developed such respect for people who work as diligently as they do to just make it through a day.\u201d</p> <p>Actors sometimes talk about taking a while to shake off their last part, as if the character lingers like a ghost. Will Danes, who is now thinking about originating her own material, miss Carrie Mathison? \u201cOh my gosh, so much,\u201d she says via the FaceTime link, where there will be no farewell handshake. \u201cI loved her.

As part of the real estate mogul\u2019s perpetual circus, he granted Karl an interview about Michael Jackson\u2019s honeymoon in Trump Tower. Meditate on that.</p> <p>Now Karl has written a book. It is an attempt to capture the madness that is the Trump presidency and the danger to democracy it poses. Aided by measured prose and healthy skepticism, Karl succeeds.</p> <p>Well-organized and respectfully written before the pandemic, Front Row at the Trump Show conveys the chaos and the characters that inhabit the president\u2019s universe.</p> <p>Also on display are Trump\u2019s preternatural disregard for the truth \u2013 \u201cTrump was a serial exaggerator long before he ran for president\u201d \u2013 and his curious soft spot for the Confederacy, the losing and slave-holding side in the American civil war.</p> <p>Front Row tells of a previously unreported White House meeting in the aftermath of the infamous 2017 far-right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/23/charlottesville-white-supremacist-james-alex-fields-heather-heyer\">the murder</a> of counter-protester Heather Heyer. Trump heaped hosannas on Robert E Lee, the defeated Confederate general, expressed sympathy for white nationalist grievance and compared himself to Abraham Lincoln.</p> <p>Relying on three sources and contemporaneous notes taken by one participant, Karl writes that Trump told the meeting the Charlottesville protesters were unfairly treated and most had \u201cgood\u201d intentions, driven to the streets by opposition to the removal of a statue of Lee. The infamous tiki torch parade \u2013 and its chants of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/16/charlottesville-neo-nazis-vice-news-hbo\">Jews will not replace us</a>\u201d \u2013 never really registered on his radar.</p> <p>Instead, sitting at a conference table first used by Ulysses Grant, the Union general who won the war and became the 18th president, Trump opined that Lee was \u201cthe greatest strategic military mind perhaps ever\u201d and also praised Thomas \u201cStonewall\u201d Jackson, another Confederate general.</p> <p>Karl also delivers his take on the White House staff. It is generally damning.</p> <p>Sean Spicer, for example, never had any business working near the Oval Office. In Karl\u2019s telling, the first Trump press secretary\u2019s rage was not limited to the briefing room podium.<strong> </strong>In a pique, Spicer slammed his office door on Karl and his daughter. He later apologized.</p> <p>Sarah Sanders, the president\u2019s second press secretary, possessed a similar affection for \u201calternative facts\u201d. She fabricated a tale about non-existent disdain within the FBI toward James Comey, which the special counsel\u2019s report <a href=\"https://www.justsecurity.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Muelller-Report-Redacted-Vol-II-Released-04.18.2019-Word-Searchable.-Reduced-Size.pdf\">examined in detail</a>.</p> <p>And then there is Anthony Scaramucci, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/aug/26/reel-history-lady-jane-grey\">Lady Jane Grey</a> of White House communications directors. Karl presents Scaramucci drawing a phallic-shaped organization chart with him on top. In Karl\u2019s words: \u201cScaramucci\u2019s diagram looked like a penis. Not a propitious start for the new communications director.\u201d</p> <p>Those in attendance \u201cstruggled to keep from laughing\u201d. Scaramucci lasted 10 days. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/03/anthony-scaramucci-post-media-company\">Maybe 11</a>.</p> <p>Karl expresses sympathy for Trump over leaked conversations with foreign leaders but reminds the president his anger should be aimed at his staff, not the press. Likewise, Karl raps Jim Acosta of CNN for his confrontational style. In Karl\u2019s view the media should not be the story.</p> <p>Parenthetically, Karl worked at CNN before joining ABC. But Karl is also the president of the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association and in that role he vigorously supported Acosta in the face of White House attempts to strip his press pass.</p> <p>Underscoring the senselessness of Trump\u2019s efforts, Karl reminds us that immediately after Acosta\u2019s credentials were restored, Trump called on him. It\u2019s not that bygones were bygones. Rather, the president can\u2019t live without a sparring partner.</p> <p>In the Age of Trump, being a reporter means having a target on your back. Karl describes <a href=\"https://www.alternet.org/2020/03/journalist-recounts-the-moment-in-the-2016-campaign-where-trump-took-a-dark-turn/\">Trump\u2019s attempts to use the media as a foil and the resultant danger</a>.</p> <p>Angered by Karl during a pre-rally interview in November 2015, Trump stormed out and unleashed an obscenity-laced tirade. As a coda, the candidate enlisted the live audience by name-checking ABC, though not Karl himself.</p> <p>\u201cWe were the villains,\u201d writes Karl. \u201cHis crowds loved the attacks on the press, and he was about to give them more of what they wanted.\u201d</p> <p>Trump continued to pour gasoline on the fire, labeling the press the \u201cenemy of the people\u201d, a phrase embraced by dictators and tyrants. Karl fears \u201cTrump\u2019s war on truth may do lasting damage to American democracy\u201d.</p> <p>And this was before a global pandemic and the real possibility of economic <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nouriel/status/1245675889884626945\">depression</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f2004491b13ab002851e1ad21a8a112b8cdfd47\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f2004491b13ab002851e1ad21a8a112b8cdfd47/0_384_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A White House aide attempts to take the microphone from Yamiche Alcindor of PBS as she questions Trump in the Rose Garden.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A White House aide attempts to take the microphone from Yamiche Alcindor of PBS as she questions Trump in the Rose Garden.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefani Reynolds/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The US leads the world in confirmed coronavirus cases, its death toll has <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/coronavirus-latest\">exploded</a> at a rate surpassing that of Italy.

New York has since postponed from 28 April to 23 June.</p> <p>Sanders recently said he would welcome a debate in April, an idea Biden dismissed.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had enough debates,\u201d the former vice-president said.</p> <p>Sanders\u2019 allies are split. Some have said it\u2019s time to exit while others believe he should continue to compete. On Saturday, the Washington Post <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/some-top-sanders-advisers-urge-him-to-consider-withdrawing/2020/04/04/224d8164-767f-11ea-85cb-8670579b863d_story.html\">reported</a> that a group of top aides, including his campaign manager, had encouraged Sanders to withdraw. But many supporters believe the senator should continue collecting delegates, which will serve as leverage to shape the party platform at the national convention.</p> <p>\u201cCampaigns are an important way to maintain that fight and raise public consciousness on those issues,\u201d Sanders <a href=\"https://www.nbc.com/late-night-with-seth-meyers/video/sen-bernie-sanders-talks-about-the-2020-race-and-vice-president-joe-biden/4141900\">said</a> on NBC\u2019s Late Night with Seth Meyers on Tuesday. \u201cSo that\u2019s, I think, one of the arguments for going forward.\u201d</p> <p>Biden has largely avoided pressuring Sanders, well aware he will need support in the fall if he is the nominee. But he\u2019s not waiting for Sanders either. In recent weeks, Biden has begun making overtures to progressives and young voters. In a fundraising call on Friday night, Biden revealed that he had spoken to Sanders about his search for a running mate.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s a friend,\u201d Biden said. \u201cI don\u2019t want him to think I\u2019m being presumptuous but you have to start now deciding who you\u2019re going to have background checks done on as potential vice-presidential candidates and it takes time.\u201d</p> <p>Like Biden, Sanders has been sharply critical of Trump\u2019s handling of the coronavirus outbreak. But they diverge on how they would harness the federal government to respond to a future pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cOur healthcare is without equal in the developed world in being dysfunctional and unfair and expensive,\u201d said Wendell Potter, former head of communications at Cigna who is now president of Business for Medicare for All. \u201cAnd I think this experience is going to bring into sharp focus how bad we are in terms of providing healthcare.\u201d</p> <p>As the crisis deepens, support for a single-payer system has climbed. In a <a href=\"https://morningconsult.com/2020/04/01/medicare-for-all-coronavirus-pandemic/\">survey</a> this month by Morning Consult, support for Medicare for All rose to 55%, its highest point since June 2019. From February to March, net support for Sanders\u2019 sweeping healthcare proposal nearly doubled from 11 points to 20 points.</p> <p>Sanders\u2019 advocacy has not moved his rival. Biden was recently pressed on MSNBC to explain why universal healthcare isn\u2019t a better option as millions of Americans stand to lose coverage in the coming months, a shift in the way questions about the sweeping proposal are typically framed.</p> <p>\u201cSingle-payer will not solve that at all,\u201d Biden replied. He said overhauling the US healthcare system would take too long and advocated instead for expanding the Affordable Care Act.</p> <p>In recent weeks, the Sanders campaign has stopped actively fundraising and instead leveraged its extensive donor list to raise money for charities helping Americans suffering from the outbreak. His team has surveyed supporters for ideas on how Congress can provide economic relief, circulated petitions demanding protective equipment and safety protections for Amazon and Walmart workers, and even adapted its digital organizing app, Bern, to help connect users with resources and aid.</p> <p>Sanders frequently hosts roundtable discussions. On one occasion he sought to channel a wartime president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, hosting a fireside chat.</p> <p>The campaign says it raised more than $4.5m for the charities and more than 14 million people have viewed its livestreams.</p> <p>Sander has also used his perch in the Senate to influence the debate over the response to the crisis. When three Republican senators objected to a provision in the $2tn rescue package that expanded unemployment insurance, Sanders threatened to block the bill unless they dropped their opposition.</p> <p>\u201cOh my God, the universe is collapsing!\u201d he said, mocking their concern that the bill might give some struggling Americans extra financial support in a time of crisis. \u201cOh my word, will the universe survive?\u201d</p> <p>The recovery package, the largest ever in American history, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/senate-passes-coronavirus-stimulus-package\">passed</a> unanimously.</p> <p>On Friday, Sanders released a slate of priorities for the next stimulus package that his campaign touted as \u201cthe boldest legislation ever written in modern history\u201d.</p> <p>They include monthly cash payments of $2,000 monthly to all individuals, including undocumented immigrants, a freeze on rent and mortgage payments, hazard pay for essential workers and using Medicare to pay all medical costs incurred during the pandemic.</p> <p>The plan is almost certainly a nonstarter in a Republican-controlled Senate wary of expanding federal relief beyond what was included in the last package.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3282a51b2d0b82c0ead7bc34bb98a8038d2d9971\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3282a51b2d0b82c0ead7bc34bb98a8038d2d9971/0_73_4416_2650/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Bernie Sanders outside the Senate chamber in Washington DC on 25 March 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bernie Sanders outside the Senate chamber in Washington DC on 25 March 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Erik S Lesser/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>\u2018Unprecedented moment\u2019</h2> <p>It remains unlikely that Sanders can dramatically reshape the Democratic primary. He is almost hopelessly behind Biden in the delegate count and many of the biggest contests left are in states that appear more favorable to the former VP, like <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-primary-d/georgia/\">Georgia</a>, <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-primary-d/ohio/\">Ohio</a> and <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-primary-d/pennsylvania/\">Pennsylvania</a>.</p> <p>The next test comes on Tuesday, when Wisconsin is scheduled to hold its primary despite calls from Sanders and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/03/wisconsin-election-coronavirus-pandemic\">several legal challenges</a> to postpone it. Sanders will likely need a strong performance in the state to keep alive the already dim prospect of a comeback. A new <a href=\"https://law.marquette.edu/poll/2020/04/01/new-marquette-law-school-poll-finds-strong-support-for-coronavirus-closings-even-as-it-shows-substantial-economic-impact/\">poll</a> from Marquette Law School found Sanders trailing Biden by nearly 30 points in the battleground state.</p> <p>Sanders knows he has a decision to make. He is, as he tells every interviewer, \u201cassessing\u201d his options. Fundamentally, he believes the pandemic has changed the calculus.</p> <p>Is it possible to fall short of his presidential ambitions but succeed in his decades-long battle to remake US society?</p> <p>\u201cRight now in this unprecedented moment in American history,\u201d Sanders told <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/whoopi-goldberg-spars-with-bernie-sanders-on-the-view-why-are-you-still-in-the-race?ref=scroll\">The View</a>. \u201cI think we need to have a very serious look at how we need to go forward.\u201d</p>"
