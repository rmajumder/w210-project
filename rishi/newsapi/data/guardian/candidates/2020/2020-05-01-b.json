That has led to international criticism and wounded national pride, writes Gina Gustavsson, an academic at Uppsala University. She asks: has Sweden\u2019s coronavirus strategy played into the hands of nationalists?</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>Sweden has persisted with the strategy of coronavirus mitigation that the UK government eventually abandoned in March. The policy is widely supported by the public, even though the Swedish Covid-19 <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality\">mortality rate</a> is among the 10 highest in the world, at <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1104709/coronavirus-deaths-worldwide-per-million-inhabitants/\">240 per million</a> population and steadily rising, and many of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/anger-in-sweden-as-elderly-pay-price-for-coronavirus-strategy\">nursing homes</a> in Stockholm are now affected.</p> \n   <p>The typical explanation for this continued public support is that Swedes are trusting and unflappable. The country\u2019s chief epidemiologist, <a href=\"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-swedish-epidemiologist-anders-tegnell-the-target-of-praise-criticism/\">Anders Tegnell</a>, the public face of the Swedish response to the pandemic, is after all a dry scientist-turned-bureaucrat, not some populist politician trying to whip up nationalist go-it-alone emotion.</p> \n   <p>But beneath the surface, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/sweden\">Sweden</a> is anything but calm. The public debate is inflamed with a sense of wounded national pride. As a believer in the kind of liberal nationalism that encourages self-critical national attachment, this pains me. But as a scholar of nationalism, I recognise the pattern. This is what Isaiah Berlin called the nationalism of \u201cthe bent twig\u201d, which lashes out against anyone who steps on it.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/may/01/sweden-coronavirus-strategy-nationalists-britain\">Has Sweden's coronavirus strategy played into the hands of nationalists? | Gina Gustavsson</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-01T12:32:30.633Z\">at 1.32pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eac0f1a8f0806a479811466\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-01T12:05:00.045Z\">1.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Thousands of Indian students unable to leave the <strong>UK</strong> because of the coronavirus lockdown are relying on food donations from charities because they can no longer afford to eat, <strong>Anna Fazackerly</strong> reports for the Guardian.</p> \n  <p>Student groups representing the students, from across Britain, have been coordinating emergency food drops with local community groups and charities.

Sean Spicer used his first briefing as White House press secretary to inflate the size of Trump\u2019s inauguration crowd. His successor, Sarah Sanders, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/25/sarah-sanders-self-confessed-liar-says-i-dont-like-being-called-a-liar\">admitted to lying to reporters</a> about the firing of the FBI director James Comey.</p> <p>The press secretary Stephanie Grisham never lied from the White House podium \u2013 because she never held a press briefing. So when the latest incumbent, Kayleigh McEnany, on Friday held the first such briefing in 417 days, the Associated Press reporter Jill Colvin had a question: \u201cWill you pledge to never lie to us from that podium?\u201d</p> <p>Without missing a beat, McEnany replied: \u201cI will never lie to you. You have my word on that.\u201d</p> <p>Expect to hear replays of that line before this presidency is done. Even on what proved an assured debut, McEnany skated close to peddling dodgy information about Trump\u2019s responses to the coronavirus pandemic (\u201cThis president has always sided on the side of data\u201d) and to allegations of sexual misconduct (\u201cHe has always told the truth\u201d).</p> <p>But the good news for the White House is that McEnany, 32, benefits by comparison with the desperately low standards of both her boss and her predecessors. Over the past month Trump has been a verbal cannon of insults, mendacity, miracle cures, self-aggrandisement and self-pity, culminating in a proposal about bleach injection to fight Covid-19 that caused him to be metaphorically led away by men in white coats.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Of course, everyone should watch the Fox News town hall with the president \u2026 It\u2019ll be can\u2019t-miss television</p> <footer> <cite>Kayleigh McEnany</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Spicer, who turned up at his first briefing in an oversized jacket and a foul mood, often resembled a rabbit caught in headlights, sealing his fate by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/apr/11/sean-spicer-hitler-chemical-weapons-holocaust-assad\">claiming Adolf Hitler never used chemical weapons</a>. Sanders was an aggressive propagandist on her boss\u2019s behalf.

Set against Trump\u2019s word salads, she sounded like a model of concision.

It\u2019s not my job to say whether or not it\u2019s troubling.\u201d</p> <p>McEnany arched her left eyebrow at that.</p> <p>She also proved adept on the most important aspects of any press secretary\u2019s job: the art of saying nothing. There were plenty of \u201cI don\u2019t want to get ahead of the president\u201d deflections. As for policy depth, which is what the briefings are meant be about, that remains to be seen.</p> <p>Kurt Bardella, a political commentator, tweeted: \u201cObjectively @kayleighmcenany is doing the best job (so far) at the podium for @realDonaldTrump than anyone else who has served as @PressSec ... her experience on cable news makes her a far more seasoned spokesperson than her predecessors.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/01/trump-michigan-protesters-gretchen-whitmer\">Michigan: Trump says Whitmer should 'make a deal' with protesters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>From the Trump team\u2019s point of view, Bardella added, \u201cshe is poised, capable, on-message, in-command, prepares and a very effective communicator\u201d.</p> <p>Mark Meadows, the new White House chief of staff who has shaken up the communications operation, will probably be pleased.

  "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s fourth White House press secretary delivered a 30-minute briefing on Friday, ending a more than year-long hiatus for the once-daily occasions.</p> <p>It was effectively a public debut for Kayleigh McEnany, whose immediate predecessor, Stephanie Grisham, never delivered a briefing in nine months in the role.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/01/joe-biden-denies-sexual-assault-allegation-tara-reade-statement\">Joe Biden denies sexual assault allegation from former staffer Tara Reade</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Recently, Trump has turned daily coronavirus task force briefings into multi-hour back-and-forths with the press. Taking the lectern for the first time, McEnany stressed that she would be speaking on behalf of the president and the highest-ranking officials in his administration.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m around the president almost the entire day,\u201d she said. \u201cI was just with him before I left to come out and speak with you guys.</p> <p>\u201cI think my staff can attest to the fact that they have a very hard time finding me because I\u2019m normally with the president in the Oval Office. So I\u2019m consistently with him, absorbing his thinking, and it\u2019s my mission to bring you the mindset of the president, deliver those facts so this president gets fair and accurate reporting and the American people get fair and accurate information.\u201d</p> <p>McEnany was less outwardly combative than Trump. She did not accuse White House reporters of being or peddling \u201cfake news\u201d. Nor did she say any outlet had terrible ratings.</p> <p>Still, she repeated Trump\u2019s main arguments. Regarding<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/us-gives-g7-countries-a-list-of-reforms-it-wants-who-to-undertake\"> the World Health Organization and its role in battling the coronavirus outbreak</a>, for example, she said: \u201cThe WHO appears to clearly have a China bias.</p> <p>\u201cI mean, you look at this timeline and it\u2019s really damning for the WHO when you consider the fact that on 31 December you had Taiwanese officials warning about human-to-human transmission, the WHO did not make that public.</p> <p>\u201cOn 9 January, the WHO repeated China\u2019s claim that the virus does not transmit readily between people, that was quite apparently false. On 14 January, the WHO again repeated China\u2019s talking points about no human-to-human transmission.\u201d</p> <p>Under fire for his own administration\u2019s response to Covid-19, which as of Friday afternoon had infected more than 1 million Americans and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/apr/30/coronavirus-map-of-the-us-latest-cases-state-by-state\">killed more than 63,000</a>, Trump has accused the WHO of slow-walking moves that could have prevented global spread. Earlier in April, he announced that his administration would halt funding to the organization, pending a review.</p> <p>McEnany\u2019s first briefing also landed on the day that Trump\u2019s all-but-certain general election opponent, the former vice-president Joe Biden, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/01/joe-biden-denies-sexual-assault-allegation-tara-reade-statement\">publicly responded to an allegation of sexual assault</a> by a former Senate staffer.</p> <p>McEnany was asked about comments made by the president in an interview with a conservative radio host, that the allegation against Biden by Tara Reade was more credible than those made against the supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh by Christine Blasey Ford or against Trump by numerous women.</p> <p>McEnany framed the accusations as old news that had been cleared up by Trump\u2019s victory in the 2016 election.</p> <p>\u201cHe has always told the truth on these issues,\u201d she claimed. \u201cHe\u2019s denied them immediately and you\u2019re bringing up issues \u2026 from four years ago that were asked and answered and the American people had their say in the matter when they elected President Trump as president of the United States.</p> <p>\u201cLeave it to the media to really take an issue about the former vice-president [Biden] and turn it on the president and bring up accusations from four years ago that were asked and answered in the form of the vote of the American people.\u201d</p> <p>McEnany also discussed Michael Flynn, the first of Trump\u2019s four national security advisers who resigned after a brief spell in the role and pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about conversations with the Russian ambassador. The president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/15/donald-trump-full-pardon-michael-flynn\">has indicated a potential pardon for Flynn</a>, who has not yet been sentenced.</p> <p>On the subject of recently unsealed investigative documents, McEnany was asked why she called the FBI investigation of Flynn a \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d, given his guilty plea. Reporters, she answered, should more aggressively cover how the FBI handled the investigation.</p> <p>Again, the press secretary \u2013 who earlier promised \u201cnever\u201d to lie to reporters \u2013 sounded some of the same notes, in a the same tone, as Trump.</p> <p>\u201cDo you not consider it a miscarriage of justice when you have the FBI writing \u2018We want to get someone to lie?\u2019\u201d McEnany said. \u201cThe answer\u2019s \u2018yes\u2019 and I encourage the media to cover it, because I\u2019ve watched a lot of your networks I\u2019ve read a lot of your papers.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen a whole lot of scant information about Michael Flynn, when there was a whole lot of speculation about Russia, Russia, Russia, culminating in $40m of taxpayer money being lost, and the complete and total exoneration of President Trump.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/01/trump-michigan-protesters-gretchen-whitmer\">Michigan: Trump says Whitmer should 'make a deal' with protesters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Most observers do not consider the special counsel Robert Mueller to have exonerated Trump in his investigation of Russian election interference <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/nov/28/crime-in-progress-glenn-simpson-peter-fritsch-review\">and links between Trump and Moscow</a>. Indeed, though he did not establish a criminal conspiracy or recommend charges of obstruction of justice, Mueller said he was not clearing the president. Trump and his allies have regularly claimed exoneration regardless.</p> <p>It is unclear how often McEnany will appear in the White House briefing room. Trump press secretaries had their appearances scaled back after the president decided they were doing an inadequate job.</p> <p>\u201cAs to the timing of the briefings, we do plan to do them,\u201d McEnany said. \u201cI will announce the timing of that forthcoming but we do plan to continue these.\u201d</p> <p>Her first appearance had lasted about half an hour, well short of Trump\u2019s marathon sessions.</p>",
  "<p>Listeners could be forgiven for a sense of deja vu: \u201cIt\u2019s going to go. It\u2019s going to leave. It\u2019s going to be gone,\u201d Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2020/apr/30/trump-says-coronavirus-will-be-eradicated-as-us-death-toll-passes-60000-video\" title=\"\">pronounced</a> of coronavirus on Wednesday.</p> <p>The words were eerily similar to the president\u2019s prediction in late February that \u201cIt\u2019s going to disappear\u201d \u2013 a theme he <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/04/28/yet-again-trump-pledges-that-coronavirus-will-simply-go-away/\" title=\"\">harped on repeatedly</a> as the caseload and fatalities rose. Since that forecast, a million Americans have fallen ill with coronavirus \u2013 almost a third of the global total \u2013 and more than 60,000 have died, in just a few weeks surpassing the US death toll in all the years of the Vietnam war. This week, it was reported that almost 70 people had died at a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/28/coronavirus-massachusetts-veterans-outbreak-holyoke-soldiers-home\" title=\"\">single veterans\u2019 nursing home</a> in Massachusetts. New York is struggling to bury its dead.</p> <p>This is what the president\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, describes as \u201ca great success story\u201d. This is the context in which the administration is letting its physical distancing guidelines lapse, instead advising much less stringent measures.</p> <p>Mr Kushner suggests that by July the country could be \u201creally rocking again\u201d. But Americans will suffer from Mr Trump\u2019s keenness to get back to business, as if the pre-coronavirus state of affairs were still possible. Medical experts have already warned about the risks of another surge in cases. The question is whether states, cities, institutions and individuals can again mitigate the harm he is wreaking upon his country. Some may; others are leading his charge: in Georgia, such essential services as tattoo parlours and bowling alleys are once again plying their trade. Texas is allowing shops, cinemas, shopping malls and restaurants to reopen, albeit with restrictions on capacity. Without significant testing and tracing, it is evident where such decisions will lead.</p> <p>The best that can be said for Mr Trump\u2019s election-driven wishful thinking is that it is less immediately dangerous than his recent public musings that people <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/trump-coronavirus-treatment-disinfectant\" title=\"\">might have injections of disinfectant</a> as a cure. Each week of the pandemic has brought new shame upon the president: he failed to equip his country and its health workers, to advocate physical distancing when it was desperately needed, or even to look like he was seriously concerned about the outbreak and its victims, preferring instead to boast about the ratings for his briefings.</p> <p>While leaders around the world enjoyed a surge in support as the pandemic took hold \u2013 the rally-around-the-flag effect \u2013 Mr Trump\u2019s appalling performance has finally taken a toll on his popularity. He had counted on a strong economy to see him back into office in November. But with more than 30 million US workers filing unemployment claims in the last six weeks \u2013 and economists suggesting that the real level of job losses could be far worse \u2013 his confidence has been shaken.</p> <p>This week it was reported that he had <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/29/us/politics/trump-campaign-reelection-polls.html\" title=\"\">lashed out at his own campaign</a> after polls showed him trailing Joe Biden in crucial states and with older voters. With the Democrat <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/29/joe-biden-sexual-assault-claim-democrats\" title=\"\">facing a sexual assault claim</a> and running a virtual campaign while Mr Trump commands daily airtime, it is clear that the president is doing the damage himself. He is seeking to shift the blame for the pandemic to the World Health Organization (having ignored its repeated warnings) and to China. On Thursday he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/30/donald-trump-coronavirus-chinese-lab-claim\" title=\"\">contradicted his own</a> director of national intelligence by claiming that he had seen evidence that the virus originated in a Wuhan laboratory; Trump officials have reportedly <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/30/us/politics/trump-administration-intelligence-coronavirus-china.html\" title=\"\">leaned on the agencies</a> to find evidence to back the theory.</p> <p>This conduct too is unpleasantly familiar. His contempt for the truth; his determination to evade responsibility while holding the most powerful job in the world; his ignorance, his narcissism and the threat he poses to his country \u2013 all have become still more painfully evident through this crisis, but were clear before. Yet he has so far defied the laws of political gravity. Americans have paid dearly for Mr Trump\u2019s complacency, recklessness, irrationality and incompetence. But are they at last ready to make him pay?</p>",

And part of that failure is Trump\u2019s \u201cspectral son-in-law\u201d Jared Kushner, who on Wednesday told Fox and Friends that the government\u2019s response to the virus was a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/\">great success story</a>\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cA great success story?

  "<p>This government should be on the rack. The evidence that it botched crucial decisions at crucial moments is piling up. The litany is now so familiar it barely needs repeating, from the failure to secure personal protective equipment for frontline workers in health and social care to the <a href=\"https://www.minghella.com/eleven-days-in-march/\">11 lost </a><a href=\"https://www.minghella.com/eleven-days-in-march/\"> days of delay</a> before imposing a lockdown that has proved essential for saving lives.</p> <p>You can focus on specific judgments: why did ministers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/29/revealed-the-inside-story-of-uk-covid-19-coronavirus-crisis\">allow mass gatherings</a>, from racing at Cheltenham to a Stereophonics gig in Cardiff, ignoring the warnings that such events would be a virus-fest? Why did it initially tell people to stay away from pubs and restaurants, but simultaneously allow those places to stay open? Why did the government call a halt in March to testing and tracing? If the answer is a lack of capacity, then why did it not immediately set about recruiting the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/17/political-imagination-end-lockdown-mass-testing-contact-tracing\">army of cont</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/17/political-imagination-end-lockdown-mass-testing-contact-tracing\">act tracers</a>\u201d that will be required if we are ever to emerge from our homes? Why the focus on mega-labs, rather than seizing on the offer of small laboratories to do testing for their local hospitals, which, as Paul Nurse, director of the Francis Crick Institute, has argued, could have made those hospitals \u201c<a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/news/health/question-time-paul-nurse-nobel-prize-coronavirus-test-target-video-2655629\">safe places</a>\u201d? Why the rules initially limiting tests to those NHS employees with symptoms, which, as Nurse puts it, allowed staff to be on wards \u201cinfecting people\u201d?</p> <p>Or you can look at decisions going back a decade, pointing a finger at Tory austerity that starved public services to the bone, leaving them underequipped and eroding our resilience. Either way, the country now faces a death toll <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/coronavirus-uk-how-many-confirmed-cases-are-there-in-my-area\">approaching 30,000</a>.</p> <p>And yet, far from being on the rack, the government continues to bask in public support. True, approval for the government\u2019s handling of the crisis has fallen from the dizzying 61% it reached a month ago to <a href=\"http://www.britishfuture.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/CovidAttitudesWeek4.pdf\">51% at last count</a>. But 51% is still the kind of approval rating most politicians long for.</p> <p>What accounts for this disconnect between the government\u2019s record and the public\u2019s high regard for those responsible? Put another way, why isn\u2019t Boris Johnson in more trouble?</p> <p>Any answer must begin with what pollsters call the \u201crally-around-the-flag\u201d effect, the tendency for voters to back their leaders in a time of crisis. Data from around the world, in this era and in others, suggests that when citizens are scared, they want to believe those in charge have the wisdom and strength to protect them. Think of electorates as passengers on a plummeting plane: in that moment of peril, they need to trust the pilot.</p> <p>In Johnson\u2019s case, there\u2019s an additional factor. No one can throw at him the traditional accusation directed at politicians, namely that he is out of touch with the seriousness of the disease. His own near-death experience with Covid-19 immunises him from that charge. The outpouring of sympathy while he clung to life in intensive care was real; some of it lingers when he briefs the nation from No 10 and grows visibly tired before the hour is up. That might prompt some voters to go a bit easier on the prime minister than they otherwise would, an indulgence buttressed by the arrival this week of a Downing Street baby. The extraordinary month Johnson has endured acts to protect the prime minister and, since this is very much his administration, the entire government.</p> <p>He\u2019s helped, too, by the fact that there is so little we know for certain about this disease. The UK may have the highest death rate in Europe, but as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/30/coronavirus-deaths-how-does-britain-compare-with-other-countries\">David Spiegelhalter argued </a>persuasively, we won\u2019t be sure of that \u201cuntil the end of the year, and the years after that\u201d. Even if Britain does turn out to be the worst hit, it\u2019ll be easy to argue that it wasn\u2019t the government\u2019s fault but was rather a function of certain immovable facts about this country: that, for example, it includes a city, London, that has no direct European equivalent in size or scale.</p> <p>Some voters are surely minded to give the government the benefit of the doubt on the grounds that it has merely been \u201cfollowing the science\u201d. That could prove a valuable alibi, nicely positioning the scientists as the fall guys once all this is done. Even those who know that when it comes to public health policy there is no such thing as \u201cthe science\u201d \u2013 that there are always going to be competing views over how to act on data once you\u2019ve got it \u2013 could see that as a reason to cut ministers some slack: faced with a near-unprecedented threat, politicians have had to make life-and-death decisions with no clear manual to follow.</p> <p>It helps that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBCNews/status/1255612280278056960?s=20\">much of the press is supportive</a>, putting the Johnson baby news or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/capt-tom-moore-thanks-people-for-support-on-his-100th-birthday\">Capt</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/capt-tom-moore-thanks-people-for-support-on-his-100th-birthday\"> Tom Moore</a> on the front and condemning the dead to the inside pages. It\u2019s handy, too, to have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/montie/status/1253974251209732096?s=20\">a few outriders attacking </a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/montie/status/1253974251209732096?s=20\"> journalists</a> for daring to ask awkward questions at a time like this, suggesting they should be biting their tongues in the spirit of national unity (when, of course, asking awkward questions of those in power is journalists\u2019 essential duty). Nor does it hurt to have an opposition that \u2013 for reasons that may make sound political sense \u2013 has decided to offer mild, \u201cconstructive\u201d criticism rather than to put the boot in.</p> <p>All of these factors have helped insulate the government from the flak that would otherwise be coming its way. But there\u2019s one more, perhaps less obvious explanation \u2013 and it relates to judgment by comparison. We don\u2019t need to wait for a full statistical analysis to know that Johnson has not been the worst world leader in this crisis, because we can declare a winner in that contest right now.</p> <p>Each day Britons wake up to ever more jaw-dropping news from across the Atlantic.

The shocking images of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/30/michigan-protests-coronavirus-lockdown-armed-capitol\">protesters wielding assault weapons</a> storming into the state assembly in Michigan on Thursday night are hardly a surprise, given that Trump himself was tweeting \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1251169217531056130\">Liberate Michigan!</a>\u201d a matter of days ago, cheering on those who are demanding their states defy the advice of Trump\u2019s own White House and prematurely end the lockdown that has so far proved to be the only way to stop the virus.</p> <p>However bad Johnson and his government of conspicuously few talents is, we know they\u2019re not that. They can at least show a modicum of human empathy for those who\u2019ve lost loved ones, a feat that continues to elude Trump. They have at least \u2013 eventually \u2013 united behind a coherent \u201cstay home\u201d message, rather than undermining that advice at every turn. They are not hawking quack cures and endorsing deranged conspiracy theories. They do not seem willing to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/1255982796230680576\">countenance mass death</a> in the insane belief that it will help them win an election. It\u2019s a low bar, but these are low times.</p> <p>\u2022 Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist</p>",
  "<p>Art conceived in the name of charity does not have the strongest track record; those with a mind for cultural ephemera wince at the memory of such fundraising musical singles as We Are the World and Do They Know It\u2019s Christmas?. Though these projects may have been organized under the objective of providing aid at a time of desperate need, their maudlin self-satisfaction could not stand up to scrutiny under the usual rubrics used to critique any other release. And so this was the specific strain of dread that <a href=\"https://youtu.be/1Vl_oUMyGYU\">Parks and Recreation</a> fans brought to the news of a reunion episode hastily coordinated in order to put together donations for Feeding America, a nonprofit funding a vast network of pantries, soup kitchens and other community-based centers. A show that often lapsed into corniness in its later years seemed primed to return drenched in high-fructose corn syrup with an extra-hefty helping of creamed corn on the side.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/mar/26/amy-poehler-one-must-try-to-be-a-good-citizen-at-this-time\">Amy Poehler: 'One must try to be a good citizen at this time'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Add to that the larger political incongruence of a distinctly Obama-era relic reviving itself in the festering dystopia of Trumpism, and the stage was set for a decently-intended minor debacle. What a relief, then, that this \u201cepisode\u201d (a term here used loosely to refer to a collection of stitched-together self-taped dialogues recorded from the cast\u2019s respective quarantines) should turn out to be nothing more than it has to \u2013 a collection of timely jokes that connect more often than they don\u2019t, reacquainting us in a low-stakes manner with the characters fans have been missing. Things may have changed, faces have developed a few new lines, but the writing staff understands that ultimately it\u2019s just nice to have the gang back together. They let the ensemble bounce off each other without letting external factors get in the way.</p> <p>Most significantly, the reunion episode sheds the political conscience that wedged the regular series into the zeitgeist during the previous presidential administration. A sunny can-do liberalism became Leslie Knope and co\u2019s calling card, an attitude that could not possibly be more out of joint in light of America\u2019s slide into soft fascism and the utter failure of the Democratic party to halt it in any meaningful way. The notion of a cameo from Knope favorite Joe Biden, currently the subject of much discussion regarding <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/01/joe-biden-denies-sexual-assault-allegation-tara-reade-statement\">accusations of sexual </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/01/joe-biden-denies-sexual-assault-allegation-tara-reade-statement\">assault</a>, was enough to turn any registered voter\u2019s stomach. Mercifully, the show conceived as \u201ca comedy version of The West Wing\u201d now comes to us from a world without Bidens or Clintons or Trumps, its comedy unsullied by commentary at a time when we all just need a laugh.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbEegHkDCV8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jbEegHkDCV8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>And so the joke writers do what they do best, and get back to writing jokes. We start with a celebrity pop-in of the welcome variety, with Paul Rudd reprising pampered heir Bobby Newport at his family\u2019s private fox-hunting estate in Switzerland, where he \u201chasn\u2019t caught any yet \u2013 they\u2019re so fast, like zoop! And they\u2019re gone!\u201d After warning of the dangers related to \u201cthe coronus\u201d, he turns it over to our pals from Pawnee, who are of course all taking the proper precautions. Their individual check-ins form the logical extension of those \u201cwhat would X-sitcom\u2019s characters be doing under quarantine?\u201d articles, giving each character a moment fitting what we know about them to our new status quo.</p> <p>Adam Scott\u2019s Ben Wyatt has combined his two great passions by writing a script for a Cones of Dunshire claymation movie, as \u201cpunishingly dense\u201d as the board game inspiring it. He\u2019s isolating separately from wife Leslie, who makes the most pointed comment while mentioning that it was \u201csad, but necessary\u201d that she had to shut down every national park. She\u2019s done her part by starting a bunch of committees and organizing a phone tree, which gives structure to this series of video calls conducted under the in-universe platform of Gryzzl. Once viewers get acclimated to the disjointed comic pacing that results from no two actors sharing the same space, it\u2019s harmless fun.</p> <p>It\u2019s like visiting your hometown to find everything right where you left it, a bit sweet and a bit sad. Nick Offerman\u2019s Ron Swanson still loves meat, and gets one of the biggest laughs by reminding us of the hysterical matrimonial dynamic at play in the Offerman-Mullally household. As wannabe baller Tom Haverford, Aziz Ansari still fixates on seeming with it, name-checking Fortnite and using background filters to place himself in a faux Bali. Dedicated nurse Ann Perkins (Rashida Jones) is on the frontlines, and must quarantine in a \u201cdifferent part of the house\u201d from her husband, Chris Traeger (Rob Lowe), as he donates blood four times each day.</p> <p>Retta\u2019s ever-elegant Donna Meagle situates herself in front of a wall of chromatically arranged sneakers. Aubrey Plaza and Chris Pratt, their careers having risen most precipitously in the years since the finale, get the least to do. We learn that the Luddgate-Dwyer household has a drum set, but most importantly, Pratt leads the stirring sing-along of Bye Bye, Li\u2019l Sebastian that takes us out. It\u2019s an easy way to conclude with something momentous and cathartic, and yet far from the worst-case scenario as to how this could\u2019ve all gone.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwYth4JZP3s\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bwYth4JZP3s?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The episode succeeds by allowing itself to be little more than a half-hour of humor. It\u2019s never better than when crafting great setups and punchlines for the tertiary faces making quick appearances. (Boozy newswoman Joan Calamezzo has an EGOT because she has been kicked out of all four major awards ceremonies; cologne magnate Dennis Feinstein markets a scent called Miracle Cure; fan-beloved Jean-Ralphio claims to have been \u201cbanned from Cameo\u201d for recording his videos naked.) </p> <p>By that same tack, the weakest moment comes when the episode adopts an about-face for the lines: \u201cThings will go back to normal. They just have to.\u201d Most Americans have made their peace with the fact that things will most definitely not snap back to normal when this all ends, and that by no means do they \u201chave to.\u201d In a lesser world, the episode would have been ripe with hollow feel-good platitudes like that one, but someone knew better. As Preston Sturges teaches us by the conclusion of Sullivan\u2019s Travels, people living in times of hardship don\u2019t need to be preached to. We just need a break from all the damned stress, and Pawnee\u2019s finest happily obliged.</p>",

It\u2019s hard to visualize it and articulate it for what it is,\u201d Jesse Case, the leader of Teamsters Local 238, the largest private-sector union in Iowa, told me.</p> <p>Donald Trump, invoking the Defense Production Act, has ordered meatpacking plants to stay open no matter the cost. Plants won\u2019t even close for a deep cleaning when a deadly pathogen is found. The president said he is protecting companies from liability \u2013 you know, in case somebody keels over because of someone else\u2019s negligence.</p> <p>Across America, packing plants for beef, pork, chicken and turkey have been closing as workers fall ill with Covid-19 or die. The United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) has <a href=\"https://www.supermarketnews.com/issues-trends/ufcw-more-5000-food-industry-employees-not-work-due-coronavirus\">said</a> that at least 72 of its members have died from coronavirus, and thousands more may be infected; because of the lack of tests, no one knows the true number. Despite <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/presidents-intelligence-briefing-book-repeatedly-cited-virus-threat/2020/04/27/ca66949a-8885-11ea-ac8a-fe9b8088e101_story.html\">repeated warnings</a> in the presidential briefing books months ago, nobody instructed industry to gear up or how.</p> <p>In Storm Lake, Iowa, center of the densest livestock-producing region in America, none of the roughly 2,500 pork and turkey processing workers at Tyson Foods plants have been tested for the coronavirus. Hence, Buena Vista county reports only four cases so far, while nearby red meat hub Sioux City is the hottest spot in the USA. Workers\u2019 temperatures are checked. If they feel sick they are advised to stay home. They are told to space out and not crowd into the locker rooms. Plastic hangs between workers on the line. Tyson says it is doing all it can by staggering breaks and spacing workers.</p> <p>Iowa\u2019s governor, Kim Reynolds, a Republican, directed testing resources to Tyson\u2019s Waterloo plant. There, workers are represented by the UFCW. The local sheriff said he wanted a boot slammed down on the slaughterhouse. But in Storm Lake, testing is limited to healthcare and nursing home workers and patients. None for the packinghouse crowd, who are overwhelmingly Latino and non-union.</p> <p>Before the order they did their duty and clocked in. Nobody had to threaten them. They need the check. If you report sick with the virus, you might imagine finding yourself on the next bus to Ju\u00e1rez whether you have papers or not. They want to work \u2013 safely.</p> <p>Tyson says that its workers are documented. But Trump and the likes of the Iowa congressman Steve King, the race-baiting Republican, have Latino workers shaking in their boots. The governor warns that if a plant reopens and you don\u2019t show up, unemployment benefits cease. And then the president orders that the plants shall reopen come hell or a virus. The leaders of the big meatpackers are warning of spot meat shortages \u2013 plant capacity has dropped 40% in recent weeks from worker shortages. You just can\u2019t let this Storm Lake plant shut down. But what happens if it explodes? The anxiety cuts to our quick.</p> <p>Remember, too, that Smithfield Foods is owned by a Chinese conglomerate. Prestage Farms, in Eagle Grove, Iowa, has taken to sending whole hog carcasses to China for lack of further processing help amid our cornfields. This is not really an American food shortage.</p> <p>The supply chain is so tight that when two plants go down \u2013 Smithfield in Sioux Falls and Tyson in Waterloo \u2013 fully 10% of national pork production is knocked out. Everyone has to eat, and they have not yet developed a taste for algae or even tofu. The world eats meat. Shoppers can clear out a grocery display in minutes, and a meat supply in a week.</p> <p>Somebody has to process the hogs and birds that keep coming no matter a virus. Mike Pence called our neighbors heroes. The secretary of agriculture, Sonny Perdue, called them patriots. Trump stopped legal residency permitting for immigrants. Nobody is talking about amnesty or even hearing the refugees. In fact, Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa told Bloomberg Law nobody is talking about providing undocumented workers healthcare.</p> <p>The state and federal governments did not order slower line speeds or provide protective gear for the packinghouse. Tyson asked for imposed guidance and resources, and got a promise of liability protection from worker claims. But there is this sticky thing called the 10th amendment that does not allow the president to waive corporate liabilities in state courts or workers\u2019 compensation processes, says Storm Lake attorney Willis Hamilton, who has been advocating for food processing employees for nearly 50 years. The order was about instilling fear, Hamilton said. He says his clients are afraid of sick leave and afraid of filing for workers\u2019 comp or unemployment.</p> <p>\u201cThey have to threaten people.

  "<p>Even amid a roaring pandemic, there are currently two Americas: \u201cUnemployment America\u201d and \u201cStock Market America\u201d, dueling lenses to view the same country.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/30/trump-brad-parscale-campaign-manager\">Trump erupts over poll slump and threatens to sue campaign manager</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Unemployment America is bleak but in Stock Market America things are looking up. Taken together, this split reality portends a rough ride for the president\u2019s re-election bid and even greater national discord. Donald Trump has every reason to worry.</p> <p>First, Unemployment America. On Thursday, the labor department reported that another <a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/OPA/newsreleases/ui-claims/20200774.pdf\">3.8 million people</a> filed first-time unemployment claims, bringing the total of those who are recently out of work to more than 30 million.</p> <p>This cataclysmic data came on the heels of the steepest first-quarter GDP decline since the Great Recession, projections of a second-quarter GDP drop of 40% and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/28/business/jobs-unemployment-coronavirus-hassett/index.html\">an admission by Kevin Hassett</a>, the president\u2019s chief economic adviser, that unemployment could hit 20% by June, a level not experienced since the Great Depression.</p> <p>For a president who claimed to be a champion of the working class, this is an abject failure. The answer to the question of whether you are better off today than you were four years ago would appear to be simple. But it isn\u2019t.</p> <p>At the same time as the economy is cratering and coronavirus\u2019s death toll has surpassed the number of US troops killed in Vietnam, the stock market has rebounded from its March lows. As a result, its behavior under Trump still surpasses its performances during the Reagan and Bush Sr years. For how much longer is still an open question.</p> <p>On the other hand, as far as Barack Obama and Bill Clinton went, Trump isn\u2019t even close. Still it\u2019s a quantifiable achievement, and those close to the president and his campaign know it.</p> <p>In a conversation with the Guardian, a connected Trump campaign adviser took pride in the market\u2019s April advance, expressed displeasure with the word choices of Trump\u2019s economic advisers, and remained mute with regard to recent job losses.</p> <p>In Trump\u2019s world, it\u2019s the \u201cstock market, stupid\u201d. No wonder Jared Kushner boasts that the administration coronavirus response \u201cis a great success story\u201d, and opines \u201cthat\u2019s really what needs to be told.\u201d Can you say, \u201cMission Accomplished 2.0\u201d?</p> <p>At the 1984 Democratic convention, Mario Cuomo, the late New York governor and father of Andrew Cuomo, the incumbent, riffed on Charles Dickens and delivered the most memorable keynote speech in recent history. Cuomo told those assembled that the nation was more a \u201cTale of Two Cities\u201d than a \u201cShining City on a Hill\u201d.</p> <p>To be sure, the speech won accolades but failed to resonate. Walter Mondale, the Democratic nominee, was shellacked on election day.</p> <p>Mondale\u2019s problem was that by 1984 most of the US came to believe that it was Morning in America. The recovery was real, inflation had been drained from the system.</p> <p>Beyond that, President Reagan had not made the stock market the exclusive barometer of the country\u2019s wellbeing. Rather, the drop in unemployment moved in tandem with the Dow\u2019s rise.</p> <p>2020, however, is a very different time and Trump is a very different president. Unemployment America is getting ravaged.</p> <p>The labor department\u2019s latest report is also flashing red over key electoral battlegrounds. Michigan and Pennsylvania are among the states with the highest insured unemployment rates. At the same time, Florida and Texas are among the states showing largest numbers of initial jobless claims. Not surprisingly, recent polls show Joe Biden with small but persistent leads in <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/fl/florida_trump_vs_biden-6841.html\">Florida</a>, <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/mi/michigan_trump_vs_biden-6761.html\">Michigan</a> and <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/pa/pennsylvania_trump_vs_biden-6861.html\">Pennsylvania</a></p> <p>To put things into perspective, if those results hold on election day, Biden would be the 46th president and Trump would go down as an impeached one-term president.</p> <p>But now even <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/tx/texas_trump_vs_biden-6818.html\">Texas is in play</a>, which last went Democratic in 1976.

Nearly 30% of the 179 active circuit court judges are now Trump appointees.</p> <p>Owing to this extraordinary push, the ideological makeup of the courts has slowly tipped in a conservative direction. Since 2017, three of the courts have \u201cflipped\u201d from a majority of judges appointed by a Democratic president to a Republican-appointment majority.</p> <p>The US court of appeals for the eleventh circuit, which oversees cases in Florida, Alabama and Georgia, has gone from an 8-3 majority of judges appointed by Democrats, with one vacancy, to a 7-5 majority of judges appointed by Republicans.</p> <p>Elsewhere, Trump has \u201cflipped\u201d the second and third Circuits, and he has effectively flipped a fourth court, the ninth circuit, some analysts think.</p> <p>\u201cI still like to think there\u2019s a bottom line for even conservative Trump appointees on the court of appeals, that there\u2019s a line there that they won\u2019t cross over, that we\u2019ll remain a country of laws and not men,\u201d said Sheldon Goldman, a professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst who focuses on the federal bench. \u201cBut who knows?\u201d</p> <p>Together the ninth, eleventh and fifth circuit courts decide thousands of cases a year with broad repercussions for daily life in America. Here\u2019s a look at how the three courts are changing under Trump.</p> <h2>Eleventh circuit</h2> <p><strong>Florida, Georgia, Alabama</strong></p> <p><strong>Key issue: Who gets to vote</strong></p> <p>Floridians struck a historic blow in favor of universal suffrage in the 2018 midterm elections, passing a constitutional amendment that restored the right to vote to felons who had completed their sentences. With a 30-point margin of victory, the will of the voters was unambiguous.</p> <p>But the reality of voting in Florida, a key presidential swing state, has been slow to change. Last May, the Republican-controlled legislature passed a law curtailing the right of felons to vote who owe money from legal penalties, significantly rolling back the 2018 referendum result.</p> <p>In reply, would-be voters sued the Republican governor, and now voting rights in Florida are in a very different place from where they seemed to be in November 2018. Instead of being before the electorate, the issue is before the federal courts, which means it is in the hands of judges appointed by Trump.</p> <p>In a ruling expected in the coming months, Trump\u2019s judges could strip the right to vote from the 1.5 million people who had it restored in the 2018 referendum, in defiance of the popular will, potentially swaying the results of the November 2020 election, in a swing state that Trump needs to hold in order to return to the White House.</p> <p>\u201cWe had fears about what these jurists would do when they got on the bench, just from their records,\u201d said Marge Baker, executive vice-president of People for the American Way (PFAW), which maintains a tracking tool of Trump\u2019s judges called <a href=\"https://www.pfaw.org/blog-posts/trump-judge-claims-states-cant-be-sued-for-voting-rights-act-violations-confirmed-judges-confirmed-fears/\">Confirmed Judges, Confirmed Fears</a>. \u201cThis administration more than any has really been putting movement ideologues on the bench who have an agenda. And once we got far enough into the administration, we realized that the judges about whom we had fears were issuing decisions that were highly problematic.\u201d</p> <p>Rulings by circuit courts, which average about 13 active judges each, are typically issued by randomly selected three-judge panels, meaning that the overall makeup of the court does not directly come into play in every ruling.</p> <p>Over time, however, the composite ideological orientation of a court comes through. And Trump\u2019s judges on the eleventh circuit have shown what critics see as a hostility to a central issue for the state of Florida and the country: voting rights.</p> <p>The legal team representing voters in the Florida felony disenfranchisement case claims in part that the state law was passed with racial and discriminatory intent in violation of the constitution.</p> <p>\u201cThis issue of felony disenfranchisement is a really important issue in the United States,\u201d said Sean Morales-Doyle, a Brennan Center lawyer who is litigating the case.</p> <p>\u201cFlorida\u2019s voters came forward and really made clear that they rejected this, that this wasn\u2019t a policy that voters on any part of the political spectrum believe in. And then we promptly saw the Florida legislature attempt to undo that.\u201d</p> <h2>Ninth circuit</h2> <p><strong>California, Oregon, Washington, Alaska, Hawaii, Montana, Idaho, Nevada, Arizona</strong></p> <p><strong>Key issue: Immigration</strong></p> <p>Since Trump became president, the US court of appeals for the ninth circuit has gone from an 18-7 majority of active judges appointed by Democrats, with four vacancies, to a much narrower 16-13 majority of judges appointed by Democrats. But the court\u2019s senior judges, who carry about half the caseload of active judges, also issue rulings \u2013 and at the senior level, Republican appointees now outnumber Democratic appointees 10-3.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe it\u2019s already flipped in some ways,\u201d said Carl Tobias, a professor at Richmond School of Law specializing in federal judicial selection, of the ninth circuit.</p> <p>Whatever the balance on the bench, activists express concern about decisions coming down from the court, historically one of the most progressive in the country. </p> <p>Trump judges on the ninth circuit have been especially abrasive in immigration cases, denying spousal visas in violation of long precedent and dismissing asylum claims, including in a case where the plaintiff had evidence of murders of multiple family members in his home country.</p> <p>In one dissent, a Trump-appointed judge supported a Trump proclamation banning entry to any would-be immigrant who could not prove either possession of health insurance or an ability to pay for healthcare.</p> <p>The judge ruled that the government would \u201csuffer immediate, irreparable harm\u201d unless the health insurance screen was allowed to stand, <a href=\"https://cases.justia.com/federal/appellate-courts/ca9/19-36020/19-36020-2019-12-20.pdf?ts=1576882834\">quoting</a> Trump on the \u201cfinancial and public health burdens that the uninsured can impose\u201d.</p> <p>Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2020/01/28/judicial-appointments-in-trumps-first-three-years-myths-and-realities/\">analyzes</a> the shifting makeup of federal courts under Trump, said the ninth circuit had undergone \u201ca big change\u201d and noted that the outsized caseload of the circuit, the biggest in the country covering 60 million people, often required visiting judges to fill in.</p> <h2>Fifth circuit</h2> <p><strong>Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi</strong></p> <p><strong>Key issue: healthcare</strong></p> <p>Since Trump became president, the US court of appeals for the fifth circuit has gone from a 9-5 majority of active judges appointed by Republicans, with three vacancies, to an 11-5 majority of judges appointed by Republicans, with one vacancy.</p> <p>Trump judges on the circuit have boosted key administration projects, especially on immigration, greenlighting $3.6bn in spending on the border wall and taking a chilly view of asylum claims. They have issued rulings inimical to employment equality and fair housing claims, and protected law enforcement from liability for excessive use of force. In a case with ominous resonance under the coronavirus pandemic, the court has defended objections on religious grounds to immunizations.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s worth pointing out that four of the courts, the fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth, had Republican-appointed majorities when Trump took office,\u201d said Wheeler. \u201cSo he has perhaps strengthened the Republican-appointee majority on those courts by putting younger and perhaps ideologically more committed judges in the place of older Republicans.\u201d</p>",

  "<h2>Top story: Trump flouts intelligence with Wuhan claims</h2> \n<p>Good morning \u2013 Warren Murray with a round-up of the main headline news this Friday morning.</p> \n<p>Tensions have emerged in NHS England as it deals with how to redeploy BAME staff away from the virus frontline to safeguard their health. The death rate among British black Africans and British Pakistanis from coronavirus in English hospitals is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/british-bame-covid-19-death-rate-more-than-twice-that-of-whites\">more than 2.5 times that of the white population</a>, according to stark analysis by the Institute of Fiscal Studies.

More than 233,300 people have died in the pandemic so far.</p> <h2><strong>US jobless toll amounts to 18.4% of working-age population</strong></h2> <p>The White House let its two-week-old economic reopening guidelines expire on Thursday as half of all US states forged ahead with their own strategies for easing restrictions on restaurants, retail and other businesses shuttered by the coronavirus crisis, Reuters reports. Thirty million Americans have filed for unemployment benefits since 21 March.</p> <h2><strong>Trump claims he has seen evidence that Covid-19 originated in Wuhan lab</strong></h2> <p>When the president was asked if he has seen anything that gives you a \u201chigh degree of confidence\u201d that coronavirus originated at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, US President Donald Trump replied: \u201cYes, I have.\u201d His own government experts say the virus was \u2018not manmade or genetically modified\u2019. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/30/cia-pushes-back-at-trump-efforts-to-link-coronavirus-to-chinese-laboratories\">US intelligence agencies have been under pressure to link coronavirus to Chinese labs</a>. Australia\u2019s prime minister, Scott Morrison, later said of the lab theory: \u201cWhat we have before us doesn\u2019t suggest that is a likely source\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>Protestors, some armed, gather inside Michigan state capitol</strong></h2> <p>Hundreds of protesters, some armed, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/30/michigan-protests-coronavirus-lockdown-armed-capitol\">gathered inside Michigan\u2019s state capitol on Thursday</a> as state lawmakers debated the Democratic governor\u2019s request to extend her emergency powers to combat coronavirus. Some of the protesters shouted anti-government slogans, including comparing the state\u2019s Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer, to Hitler. \u201cSome of my colleagues who own bullet proof vests are wearing them,\u201d the state senator Dayna Polehanki wrote on Twitter.</p> <h2><strong>Major US airlines will require passengers to cover their faces during flights</strong></h2> <p>American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines said Thursday they will soon require passengers to cover their faces during flights, following the lead of JetBlue Airways, Reuters reports.</p> <h2><strong>Boris Johnson says UK now \u2018past the peak\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Johnson promised to set out next week how schools and workplaces could safely reopen once lockdown restrictions were eased, as he claimed the UK was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/30/britain-is-past-peak-of-coronavirus-outbreak-says-boris-johnson\">past the peak of the coronavirus outbreak</a>.

The drugs, approved to treat malaria, have yet to be proven effective for this new use but have been repeatedly promoted by Trump, who has called them a \u201cgame-changer\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI am speaking out because to combat this deadly virus, science \u2013 not politics or cronyism \u2013 has to lead the way,\u201d Bright said in a statement, adding he was concerned about \u201cefforts to fund potentially dangerous drugs promoted by those with political connections\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"264b102e1e779ad112be3526cdd514d46f2e784b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/264b102e1e779ad112be3526cdd514d46f2e784b/0_0_2400_3000/800.jpg\" alt=\"Dr Rick Bright, the former head of Barda.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dr Rick Bright, the former head of Barda.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bright\u2019s lawyers, Lisa Banks and Debra Katz, subsequently claimed their client was pushed out of his job solely because he \u201cresisted efforts to provide unfettered access to potentially dangerous drugs, including chloroquine, a drug promoted by the administration as a panacea, but which is untested and possibly deadly when used improperly\u201d.</p> <p>It is expected that Bright\u2019s complaint, when revealed, will shed new light on the political pressure exerted by the Trump administration on health officials to back up the president\u2019s sweeping praise of the drugs as a key weapon against Covid-19.</p> <p>According to reporting by <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/04/internal-documents-reveal-team-trumps-chloroquine-master-plan\">outlets including Vanity Fair</a>, administration officials pushed for the widespread use of hydroxychloroquine, despite the FDA\u2019s warnings, while also formulating a narrative where Bright was shifted from his role after mistreating his staff. His lawyers reject this characterization.</p> <p>The battle between Trump and an obscure official who was in charge of a little-known office is set to touch upon broader themes that have repeatedly cropped up during this presidency, specifically the treatment of scientific advice and the use of the federal government to promote the personal views of the president over experts.</p> <p>\u201cDr Bright is a strong scientist, he is a visionary leader, he\u2019s able to make decisions, he get things done, and he believes and he stands on strong science,\u201d Nicole Lurie, former assistant secretary at the Department of Health and Human Services, told CNN. \u201cI think this is about something larger than hydroxychloroquine. I think it\u2019s really about listening to scientific opinion, scientific perspective and standing up for strong science.\u201d</p> <p>Top officials at the Department of Health and Human Services have disputed Bright\u2019s account, pointing out that he has been moved to an important role managing a public-private partnership on vaccine development and treatment. When asked about Bright, Trump said that he had never heard of the man heading the effort to find a vaccine for a virus that has already caused more than 60,000 deaths in the US.</p> <p>The president has repeatedly advocated the use of hydroxychloroquine following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/hydroxychloroquine-coronavirus-scientific-studies-research\">a small-scale study in France</a> that showed some patients with Covid-19 responded well after taking it. However, further studies have shown mixed or negative results, with research linking it to heart problems and other serious conditions if not administered properly.</p> <p>Trump said on 19 March the drug could be \u201creally incredible\u201d in the fight against coronavirus and by that evening first-time prescriptions for hydroxychloroquine were 46 times the rate of the average weekday, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/25/us/coronavirus-trump-chloroquine-hydroxychloroquine.html\">according to one analysis</a>. The surge in demand for the drug worried public health experts about serious harm arising from its use, as well as about people with conditions like lupus \u2013 a proven target for hydroxychloroquine \u2013 facing a shortage in supply.</p> <p>Two days after Bright announcing his planned whistleblower complaint, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-cautions-against-use-hydroxychloroquine-or-chloroquine-covid-19-outside-hospital-setting-or\">warning</a> against the use of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. The drugs, the regulator warned, can cause a number of side-effects \u201cincluding serious heart rhythm problems that can be life-threatening\u201d.</p> <p>The FDA issued an emergency use order to allow the drugs to be used in hospitals under certain conditions but the regulator said they should not be used outside this context.</p> <p>Clinical trials to establish safe use of drugs for new purposes usually take several years, a process chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have not gone through. The drugs, the FDA states, \u201chave not been shown to be safe and effective for treating or preventing Covid-19\u201d.</p>",

  "<p>The plight of the romantic comedy over the past decade has, for me, been painful to watch. Once a staple of the multiplex, low-to-mid-budget romcoms in the vein of Suddenly 30 or How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days have all but disappeared from screens, replaced by gross-out bro comedies, superhero movies, and, on the other end of the spectrum, \u201cimportant\u201d films.</p> <p>Most people probably don\u2019t yearn for another Legally Blonde, but for someone like me \u2013 whose childhood was filled with DVD screenings of ultra-saturated stories of hardened career girls and their quests for love \u2013 there\u2019s nothing like a humble romcom.

Created by Sex and the City\u2019s Darren Star, Younger ticks all the boxes on my perfect romcom checklist: it has a bizarre premise (a 40-something divorcee, played by Sutton Foster, pretends to be 27 in order to get a publishing job); a cast of quirky gal-pals (Hillary Duff as a savvy careerist, Molly Bernard as a wacky publicist, Debi Mazar as a wise lesbian artist); a saucy love triangle (Foster\u2019s Liza is caught between her staid, enigmatic CEO, and a sensitive, chiseled tattoo artist); and a hardened-but-caring boss, played hilariously by Miriam Shor.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c976533d5928cfdfba655b1f4bcdd475dbc56475\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c976533d5928cfdfba655b1f4bcdd475dbc56475/0_0_2000_1154/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Molly Bernard, Hillary Duff and Sutton Foster in season four of Younger.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"577\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Molly Bernard, Hillary Duff and Sutton Foster in season four of Younger.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Like all the best romcoms, the show\u2019s leads have entry-level jobs in a dying industry (in this case, publishing), but can somehow afford designer outfits and glamorous Williamsburg lofts; they attend parties every evening and still manage to find time to read thousand-page manuscripts and marketing plans. In Younger\u2019s version of publishing, business meetings are more often than not excuses to drink heavily or dive into a rooftop pool, and signing an author often involves going on a few dates with them, too. Younger is a fairytale, and it\u2019s all the better for it.</p> <p>And like many from the genre\u2019s Golden Age (roughly 2001\u201308, in my estimation), the show also provides a slyly salient critique of the feminist mores of its time. In the same way that Bridget Jones\u2019 Diary smartly found comedy in the tension between its title character\u2019s desire for a romantic partner and her desire to not need a romantic partner \u2013 in the process skewering the concept of \u201cHaving It All\u201d <strong>\u2013</strong> Younger picks apart the corporatisation of identity politics with a surprisingly ruthless eye.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/sep/29/why-romcoms-have-all-the-answers-film-eva-wiseman-modern-love\">Why romcoms have all the answers | Eva Wiseman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Many episodes introduce thinly veiled stand-ins for feminist authors like Lena Dunham and Cat Marnell, using them as an opportunity to expose the narcissism that often underscored 2010s girl-boss feminism; other plot lines ponder why youthful activists seem to abhor every kind of discrimination except ageism, the bogeyman that follows Liza around every corner in the form of new fads and social standards.</p> <p>One particularly great episode involves Duff\u2019s character Kelsey attending a networking function at feminist co-working space The Nest, only to find that it\u2019s more of an opportunity for rich attendees to shill their products and talk up their credentials than an opportunity to connect. The episode aired years before a New York Times<em> </em>expose alleged that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/magazine/the-wing.html\">The Nest\u2019s real-life analogue, The Wing, was doing the same thing</a>.</p> <p>It\u2019s this tonal sweet-spot \u2013 shrewd where it counts, blithely far-fetched everywhere else \u2013 that keeps me coming back to Younger. At its worst, it\u2019s still a well-acted, delightfully lightweight confection; at its sharpest, it feels strangely essential, carrying the torch of the best 2000s romcoms and forging a new path for mid-budget, female-centric comedies.

Biden\u2019s campaign has forcefully denied the allegation, but the candidate has not commented personally.</p> <p>Biden\u2019s interview on Morning Joe, a cable news talk show, comes after new evidence emerged this week corroborating aspects of Reade\u2019s story, which has escalated along partisan lines.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/29/joe-biden-sexual-assault-claim-democrats\">Pressure mounts on Joe Biden to address sexual assault claim</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In recent days, Biden has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/29/joe-biden-sexual-assault-claim-democrats\">faced mounting calls </a>from some Democrats to make a public statement, even as the party\u2019s leadership stands behind him. Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker on Thursday stressed her support for Biden\u2019s nomination while Republicans seized the opportunity to attack Biden and his record ahead of a general election against Donald Trump, who has been accused of sexual assault and misconduct by more than a dozen women, all of which he has denied.</p> <p>The issue has forced Democrats into an increasingly uncomfortable position as they grapple with how to respond in a way that is consistent with their support for the #MeToo movement. The party\u2019s leadership has so far supported Biden, defending his character and pointing to his legislative record on sexual violence policy.</p> <p>Already, top female surrogates and allies, including potential vice presidential candidates such as Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar and Stacey Abrams, have been asked whether they stand by him. Yet he has not been asked about it in the dozens of television interviews, virtual town halls or donor events he\u2019s participated in.</p> <p>Some progressive activists have <a href=\"https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fclairesandberg%2Fstatus%2F1255189090821189638\">called</a> on Biden to step down as the party nominee while advocates for victims of sexual assault have been disappointed by the handling of Reade\u2019s claim by Biden\u2019s campaign and the press.</p> <p>The issue was not raised on Thursday during an Instagram live event with soccer star Megan Rapinoe, a prominent advocate of equal pay and gender equality. Yet several viewers posted comments during the livestream urging Rapinoe to ask Biden about the allegation.</p> <p>On Thursday, Pelosi, the highest-ranking woman in American politics, sought to dispel any concern about Biden\u2019s candidacy.</p> <p>\u201cI want to remove all doubt in anyone\u2019s mind: I have a great comfort level with the situation as I see it, with all due respect in the world for any woman who comes forward, with all the highest regard for Joe Biden,\u201d Pelosi told reporters on Thursday, adding that she had \u201ccomplete respect\u201d for the #MeToo movement.</p> <p>\u201cThere is also due process,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cAnd the fact that Joe Biden is Joe Biden.\u201d</p> <p>Republicans seized on the remark to accuse Pelosi and the party more broadly of hypocrisy on issues of sexual assault and harassment. They compared her response to the allegation against Biden to the accusation against Brett Kavanaugh during his supreme court confirmation hearing.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s being a hypocrite,\u201d said Kevin McCarthy, the House minority leader. \u201cYou can\u2019t say one thing about every other time she has commented about any other accusation, and now say this is different.\u201d</p> <p>In an interview with Fox News, Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, said Biden should release his Senate papers to shed more light on the allegation, though he has not made a similar appeal for information related to the charges against Trump.</p> <p>The president also weighed in on the allegation on Thursday, calling on Biden to respond while conceding that the claim could be \u201cfalse\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI know all about false accusations,\u201d he said. \u201cI have been falsely charged numerous times and there is such a thing.\u201d</p> <p>Still, Trump\u2019s campaign has made clear they intend to use Reade\u2019s claim to undercut Biden, who has made character a central theme of his campaign against Trump. A Trump campaign memo published on Wednesday highlighted Biden\u2019s response to Reade\u2019s claim and accused him of \u201cmisrepresenting news reports and his own past positions in an effort to put controversies to bed or to level charges against the president\u201d.<br></p>",

And in China, where officials shut down travel both in and out of Wuhan, the city where the Covid-19 outbreak began, the travel ban barely slowed the spread of diseases, according to a report published in Science.</p> <p>But there is no evidence that travel restrictions ultimately stopped the spread of coronavirus, or significantly reduced the contagion\u2019s death toll. </p> <p>Read more: </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/trump-coronavirus-travel-ban-europe-us\">Will Trump's coronavirus travel ban work?
