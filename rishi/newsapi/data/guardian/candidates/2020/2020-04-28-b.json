  "<p>Donald Trump has predicted a \u201cgreat\u201d economic rebound in the fall and claimed the country would soon be performing 5m coronavirus diagnostic tests a day, as the number of confirmed cases in the US surpassed a million.</p> <p>Some health experts have suggested that the US would have to carry out 5m tests a day by June to reopen its economy safely. Others have suggested as many as <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/04/20/1000228/the-us-will-need-to-do-20-million-tests-a-day-to-reopen-safely/\">20m</a><a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/04/20/1000228/the-us-will-need-to-do-20-million-tests-a-day-to-reopen-safely/\"> tests a day</a> would ultimately be needed. The US daily rate is currently 200,000.</p> <p>Addressing a news conference on aid to small businesses on Tuesday, Trump appeared unaware of the current figures, suggesting \u201cit could be that we\u2019re getting very close\u201d to 5m daily tests.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to be there very soon,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The US has carried out 5.6m tests over the past two months, which as Trump pointed out was <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/covid-testing\">far more than any other country</a>, but represented about 1.6% of the population, a higher percentage than most countries, though significantly below Italy.</p> <p>Trump was also bullish on the prospects for economic recovery in the fall.</p> <p>\u201cNow our country\u2019s opening up again and I think it\u2019s going to be very, very successful,\u201d he said. \u201cI think the fourth quarter will be great. And I think next year is going to be a tremendous year for this country.\u201d</p> <p>In what looks almost certain to become another hostage to fortune, the president implied that the pandemic would be largely cleared by the fourth quarter of the year.</p> <p>\u201cI think what happens is it\u2019s going to go away. This is going to go,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd whether it comes back in a modified form in the fall, we\u2019ll be able to handle it. We\u2019ll be able to put out spurts, and we\u2019re very prepared to handle it.\u201d</p> <p>On a day that cases hit the grim 1m milestone and fatalities overtook the US death toll from the Vietnam war of 58,220, Trump was reminded that in February, he had predicted that infections would soon all but evaporate. The president said on 26 February, when there were only 15 confirmed US cases, that \u201cwithin a couple of days [it\u2019s] going to be down to close to zero, That\u2019s a pretty good job we\u2019ve done.\u201d</p> <p>He replied on Tuesday that it would \u201cultimately\u201d be true.</p> <p>\u201cAt the appropriate time it will be down to zero, like we said,\u201d he insisted.</p> <p>The US began wholesale testing weeks later than many other developed countries, a fact Trump hinted was the fault of the previous administration.</p> <p>\u201cWe inherited a very broken test,\u201d he said, although the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/25/coronavirus-outbreak-severe-disruption-america-cdc-united-states\">faulty test</a> was produced in early February, three years into Trump\u2019s administration. The president also pointed to unnamed experts for the initial complacency of the administration\u2019s response.</p> <p>\u201cMany very good experts, very good people too, said that this would never affect the United States, it wouldn\u2019t affect Europe, it wouldn\u2019t affect anything outside of China,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so we were listening to experts and we always will listen to experts, but the experts got it wrong.\u201d</p> <p>Global health experts were almost unanimous in raising the alarm over the coronavirus threat in January and February. The Washington Post reported on Tuesday that <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/presidents-intelligence-briefing-book-repeatedly-cited-virus-threat/2020/04/27/ca66949a-8885-11ea-ac8a-fe9b8088e101_story.html\">US intelligence agencies had also issued warnings</a> about the scale of the coronavirus threats in more than a dozen of the president\u2019s daily classified briefings over the course of January and February.</p> <p>The danger was played down, however, by several television personalities who the president watches regularly, and reportedly by his health and human services secretary, Alex Azar, who according to the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/health-chiefs-early-missteps-set-back-coronavirus-response-11587570514\">Wall Street Journal</a> assured Trump on 29 January that the coronavirus was under control in the US.</p>",
  "<p>When New Zealand holds its post-virus general election later this year, the country will go through a fiercely ideological debate about economics and resources.</p> <p>On 19 September, New Zealanders are scheduled to go to the polls. By then, the country is likely to have eliminated Covid-19, providing an enormous boost for Jacinda Ardern\u2019s government, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/28/new-zealand-starts-gradual-exit-from-coronavirus-lockdown\">which is blitzing the immediate health crisis.</a></p> <p>However, at the election New Zealanders will also be evaluating the contrasting left-and rightwing prescriptions for dealing with a severe economic depression. And that could see a fiercely-ideological election debate based around economics and resources.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/25/why-do-female-leaders-seem-to-be-more-successful-at-managing-the-coronavirus-crisis\">Are female leaders more successful at managing the coronavirus crisis?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Currently, the treasury is forecasting unemployment could go as high as 26%. Regardless of whether this worst-case scenario comes to pass, there will be extreme economic dislocation and suffering. Politicians will need to provide voters with a compelling vision, backed by detailed policies, for rebuilding the country.</p> <p>Recreating the old order won\u2019t be good enough. After all, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/ardern-accused-of-making-new-zealand-businesses-sacrificial-lambs-in-covid-19-lockdown\">the looming depression </a>will come on top of huge pre-existing problems of inequality, poverty, a housing affordability crisis, and a creaking welfare state.</p> <p>If Labour is to embody the spirit of the times, it will embrace radical new economic policies. This means proposing new progressive income taxes, a wealth tax, a universal basic income, a massive state housing programme, and an overhaul of the public health system. And that\u2019s just for starters.</p> <p>If National is to keep to its conservative impulses, then it will campaign on being \u201cbetter economic managers\u201d, cutting regulations, reducing taxes on business, and generally letting the private sector lead the recovery.</p> <p>However, it\u2019s unlikely that a traditional austerity sales pitch will be welcome in 2020. The landscape has changed dramatically, with traditional rightwing economic prescriptions now jettisoned by governments of all colours. Instead of a small state being the answer, the crisis has required huge state intervention. As a number of economists have noted, we\u2019re all socialists now.</p> <p>The state has even bailed out of the most rightwing voice in New Zealand politics \u2013 the Taxpayers Union. For this neoliberal lobby group to apply for, and be given, $60,000 of subsidies in order to keep operating is testament to the fact that the old order of pro-market politics has died.</p> <p>National will have to do better than recycle policies from the neoliberal era. In fact, to be truly competitive it is very likely, come September, they will be proposing their own big-spending statist economic interventions. On issues such as infrastructure, National has the potential to be an even bigger party of government than Labour.</p> <p>Policies such as a universal basic income \u2013 once relegated to the political fringes \u2013 could even be adopted by the right.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/apr/23/covid-19-crisis-reset-economies-sustainable-footing\">The Covid-19 crisis creates a chance to reset economies on a sustainable footing | James Shaw</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For the immediate future, politics is going to be all about economics. In that sense it will mark the return of the traditional left-right politics that dominated the 20th century, before social issues gained the ascendancy. Since the 1960s, politics in countries like New Zealand have become less about economics (or what political scientists call \u201cmaterialist concerns\u201d) and more about post-materialist issues.</p> <p>These non-economic issues \u2013 debates on everything from nuclear weapons, abortion, sexual politics, racism and environmentalism \u2013 never fitted easily into the traditional left-right spectrum.</p> <p>Important debates raised by feminists, M\u0101ori nationalists, the peace movement, environmentalists and so forth also brought into play concepts such as culture wars, political correctness, identity politics, woke politics, and social liberalism. Alongside this, other non-materialist concerns around free speech, immigration, and religion have been central to understanding modern politics.</p> <p>The importance of these strains of contemporary politics wax and wane, and at various times the culture wars have receded. When the global financial crisis hit in 2008, there was a concentration on more basic economic issues. On the left there was a spike of concern about workers\u2019 rights, economic inequality, the welfare state, and so forth.</p> <p>Such concerns underpinned much of the debate in New Zealand\u2019s 2008, 2011 and 2014 elections. Then, with economic prosperity returning, post-materialist concerns came to the fore again. Issues like gender and ethnic inequality dominated, especially on the left. And climate change grew to become an overarching concern.</p> <p>In the wake of Covid-19, post-materialist issues are likely to weaken once again, becoming overshadowed by more basic concerns about putting food on the table.</p> <p>Labour and National, as the original left-right political parties, will be relatively well suited to this re-emerging debate on economic and resource issues.</p> <p>But where will the minor parties fit in? Even before the coronavirus crisis, the minor parties were struggling for relevance. This situation has only been made worse, and some could even be finished off by the return to a more economic focus.</p> <p>The Greens are unlikely to prosper, and may not even survive, as concerns about the environment take a back seat for voters dealing with an economic crisis.</p> <p>The rightwing Act party, which has at times played a central role in the culture wars, especially on free speech issues, will have to reorientate towards its original radical pro-business programme.</p> <p>The M\u0101ori party, currently out of Parliament, will have to prioritise being the voice of M\u0101ori at the bottom of the economic pile.</p> <p>There is still one rising non-economic concern that provides an opportunity for a minor party: nationalism. According to a number of opinion polls we\u2019re experiencing a surge of patriotism. People are celebrating New Zealand\u2019s stand-out success in battling the virus. There\u2019s one party that is uniquely equipped to surf that wave \u2013 Winston Peters\u2019 New Zealand First.</p> <p>Given National has ruled out building a government with Peters\u2019 help, any surge of nationalist support for NZ First will make the re-election of the Labour-led Government much more likely, regardless of what happens in the economic debates.</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Bryce Edwards is a senior associate at the Institute for Governance and Policy Studies at Victoria University, Wellington, New Zealand</em></p></li> </ul>",

Democrats across the US generally are pushing to ease restrictions on voting, saying the policies needlessly shut out eligible voters. Republicans largely have defended those restrictions, saying elections are vulnerable to fraud, though several studies have shown <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/issues/ensure-every-american-can-vote/vote-suppression/myth-voter-fraud\">it is exceptionally rare</a>.</p> <p>Overall, 59% of Americans are confident the election will be fair and accurate, and 63% believe all eligible citizens will be able to vote.</p> <p>Though Donald Trump has criticized efforts to expand <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/08/trump-mail-in-voting-2020-election\">vote by mail during</a> the Covid-19 crisis, claiming it would boost voter fraud and Democratic turnout, the survey found less partisan divide on the topic. </p> <p>In states where vote by mail is already widely used, nearly 70% of Republicans support expanding vote by mail.

  "<p>The White House has released guidance pushing responsibility for Covid-19 testing on to state governments in a political strategy that has been criticised as \u201cterrible\u201d for public health.</p> <p>However, under pressure to ramp up testing as several states make moves to reopen, Donald Trump\u2019s announcement instead continues to send <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/28/us/coronavirus-updates.html#link-2531a35c\">mixed messaging</a> around testing targets, with most of the burden falling on states.</p> <p>\u201cThey know that the federal response has been a disaster, and so now their strategy is blame 50 states,\u201d Ashish K Jha, faculty director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, told the Guardian.</p> <p>Jha has spoken to White House officials who acknowledge the need for far more testing, which they understand will be difficult to do \u201cunless the federal government takes direct responsibility\u201d, he says.</p> <p>\u201cIf I know that the only way to fix this is federal, and yet I\u2019m saying I\u2019m gonna make the states responsible, it\u2019s another way of saying I know this isn\u2019t gonna work,\u201d Jha said.</p> <p>Following early setbacks, the US has scrambled to scale up <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/testing.html\">diagnostic testing</a> as part of a strategy to safely reopen the country. But current testing levels are still far from where they need to be, experts warn, even as restless Americans crowd <a href=\"https://apnews.com/994c91394e7fdeda403c0e27bb1c5f2d\">beaches</a> and <a href=\"https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2020/04/25/coronavirus-central-park-long-beach-crowds/\">parks</a> and states such as Texas and Georgia begin to relax their stay-at-home orders.</p> <p>Dr Anthony Fauci, an infectious disease expert and key member of the White House\u2019s coronavirus taskforce, said on Saturday that the country was performing between 1.5m and 2m diagnostic tests a week.</p> <p>\u201cWe probably should get up to twice that as we get into the next several weeks, and I think we will,\u201d he said, though he added that \u201c<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/25/politics/fauci-us-double-diagnostic-testing-coronavirus/index.html\">testing is an important part but it\u2019s not the only part</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Trump and some of his allies are congratulating themselves for efforts they\u2019ve already made on testing and predict exponential growth in capacity. \u201cWe\u2019re going with maximum testing, because it\u2019s something we\u2019re very capable of doing,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-33/\">Trump said Monday</a>. \u201cWe\u2019ll be much more than doubled.\u201d</p> <p>But another administration official has said the federal government actually means for states to test at least 2% of their residents monthly, according to the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/28/us/coronavirus-updates.html#link-2531a35c\">New York Times</a>, a rate not dissimilar from the one now.</p> <p>CVS Health and Walgreens, two of the US\u2019s major pharmacy chains, announced they were expanding free testing, with CVS aiming for as many as 1.5m tests each month, <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/04/27/coronavirus-tests-cvs-pharmacy-covid-19-testing-cvs-health/3035524001/\">USA Today</a> reported.</p> <p>More than 190,000 new tests were reported nationwide on Monday, <a href=\"https://covidtracking.com/data/us-daily\">according to the Covid Tracking Project</a>, a gargantuan boost compared with the single digits recorded only two months before. But as the country steamrolls into May, 500,000 diagnostic tests will represent \u201cthe bare minimum\u201d per day to capture most infected people and assuage Americans\u2019 concerns, said Jha, a threshold that still hasn\u2019t been reached on any single day so far.</p> <p>\u201cIdentifying who\u2019s infected, who\u2019s not is like public health, disease control 101. Without that, you\u2019ve got nothing,\u201d Jha said. \u201cIf you can\u2019t test people for the virus, you cannot figure out who\u2019s infected, you can\u2019t keep them away from susceptible people, you can\u2019t run your economy.\u201d</p> <p>Not all states will necessarily be equally affected, as an outbreak\u2019s size drives testing needs, Jha said. In an analysis he and his team collaborated on with <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/27/coronavirus-many-states-short-of-testing-levels-needed-for-safe-reopening/\">Stat</a>, projections show that New York will require upwards of 100,000 more tests per day starting in May to catch most infected people in time. This despite the state\u2019s already impressive infrastructure, where <a href=\"https://covidtracking.com/data\">more people</a> have been tested than anywhere else in the US.</p> <p>Texas, on the other hand, has been disparaged for <a href=\"https://www.star-telegram.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article242250436.html\">its lack of testing</a>. But Jha\u2019s analysis shows the state is actually <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/27/coronavirus-many-states-short-of-testing-levels-needed-for-safe-reopening/\">performing enough tests</a> for early May, if social distancing measures remain in place. The Texas governor, Greg Abbott, has instead announced that he will <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/27/politics/texas-reopening-may-1-coronavirus/index.html\">allow some businesses </a>to reopen on Friday, a move with unclear consequences.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the key about the virus, is any action you take today, you won\u2019t see the benefits or the costs for several weeks,\u201d Jha said.</p> <p>Meanwhile, antibody tests \u2013 once touted as a potential measurement for who could safely re-enter society after developing immunity to the disease \u2013 have taken on a lesser role as the country actually moves toward reopening. Such a minuscule proportion of the US population has been exposed to the virus, and false positives on immunity tests abound, Jha said. But perhaps even more significantly, there is \u201c<a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/immunity-passports-in-the-context-of-covid-19\">no evidence</a>\u201d that recovered Covid-19 patients cannot get infected again, even if they have antibodies, the World Health Organization <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/commentaries/detail/immunity-passports-in-the-context-of-covid-19\">wrote</a> on Friday.</p> <p>\u201cMost of us believe that having antibodies should be protective for most people, but that\u2019s a lot of caveats,\u201d said Jha. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like we should make policy based on luck.\u201d</p>",

Cleaning supplies might as well be magical potions to him.\u201d Noah broke out his Trump impression: \u201cI dropped a hamburger on the carpet, then some Mexican lady came in with some Clorox, sprayed it on the carpet, said some spell in Spanish, and then it was gone.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/apr/24/trevor-noah-trump-coronavirus-stephen-colbert-jimmy-kimmel\">Trevor Noah: Trump 'seems to think of chaos as an essential service'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re some random guy on the internet with 12 followers, you can say shit like this and it really doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Noah explained. \u201cBut Donald Trump is not just some random guy.\u201d And in what Noah is now calling \u201cthe pandumbic\u201d, Trump\u2019s comments have had significant fallout, such as upticks in calls to state poison control hotlines, and the release of warnings from cleaning supply companies to <em>not eat bleach.</em></p> <p>\u201cYep, this is where we are now: authorities have to respond to the president\u2019s ideas the same way they do to viral TikTok challenges,\u201d said Noah.

Two of the videos were <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/16/us/politics/unidentified-flying-object-navy.html\">published</a> by the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/16/us/politics/pentagon-program-ufo-harry-reid.html\">New York Times</a> in 2017. The other video was released by the To the Stars Academy of Arts and Science group, a media and private science organization.</p> \n<p>The 2004 video shows an incident that happened 100 miles out over the Pacific, according to the New York Times. Two navy fighter pilots found an oblong object hovering above the water. It then flew quickly away. \u201cIt accelerated like nothing I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d one of pilots, Cmdr David Fravor, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/16/us/politics/unidentified-flying-object-navy.html\">told the NYT</a>.</p> \n<p>The 2015 videos show objects moving quickly through the sky, one of them seeming to spin in the air. \u201cLook at that thing, dude!\u201d a pilot says. \u201cIt\u2019s rotating!\u201d</p> \n<p>The release of the videos by the Pentagon adds to the legitimacy of the videos and will spur more speculation that humans have recently interacted with extraterrestrials.

Her campaign chairman, John Podesta, has displayed an <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/04/07/politics/john-podesta-hillary-clinton-ufo/\">interest</a> in the subject as well.</p> \n<p>Last June, Donald Trump fueled a new round of discussion in political circles about extraterrestrials when he said he had been briefed on sightings of unidentified aircraft by US navy pilots.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think it\u2019s probably \u2013 I want them to think whatever they think,\u201d Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/20/area-51-raid-aliens-events\">said</a> to ABC News. \u201cThey do say, and I\u2019ve seen, and I\u2019ve read, and I\u2019ve heard.

Not particular.\u201d</p> \n<p>In September an internet hoax resulted in 75 people arriving at Area 51 \u2013 the infamous secret military facility in the Nevada desert that is rumored to house evidence of extraterrestrials \u2013 in a project to storm the base to hunt for evidence of aliens.</p> \n<p>However, the invitation to storm Area 51 sparked festivals all across Nevada. A local sheriff <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/20/area-51-raid-aliens-events\">estimated</a> 1,500 people attended those festivals, underscoring the pop culture interest in evidence of extraterrestrial life.</p> \n<p>In 2018 the Irish Aviation Authority investigated a sighting of a reported UFO by commercial airline pilots. The IAA <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/13/irish-authorities-investigate-ufo-sightings-by-commercial-pilots\">said</a> it would investigate the sightings but a spokesman for the organization said it was unlikely that the objects were beings from another planet.</p>",

  "<p>I don\u2019t know what kind of disinfectant Donald Trump has been injecting, but the man does not appear to be well. The president\u2019s lethal medical musing has turned him into (even more of) a global laughing stock and the widespread ridicule has clearly bruised his fragile ego. While Trump has never been a paradigm of calmness or competence, he has become increasingly irate and erratic in recent days. Now even his diehard supporters seem to be cooling towards him.

Monday\u2019s briefing was notable for the briefness of Trump\u2019s remarks; instead of treating it like a political rally, he ceded the floor to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/27/coronavirus-us-live-cases-america-trump-cuomo-states-reopen-plans-latest-news-updates\">number of CEOs</a>.</p> \n<p>Trump enjoyed a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/commentisfree/2020/mar/24/trump-pandemic-floundering-coronavirus-crisis\">bump</a> in his ratings last month when he stopped downplaying coronavirus and announced a 15-day plan to slow the virus\u2019s spread. During his brief experiment with coherence, 55% of Americans said they approved of the way he was handling the crisis and CNN\u2019s chief political correspondent, Dana Bash, told viewers Trump \u201cis being <a href=\"https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/mar/17/dana-bash-praises-trumps-press-conference-the-kind/\">the kind of leader that people need</a>\u201d.</p> \n<p>The tide now seems to have turned. <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-are-largely-unimpressed-with-trumps-handling-of-the-coronavirus-pandemic/\">Recent polls</a> show that most Americans are unimpressed with Trump\u2019s handling of the crisis.

They have a relationship with the landlord, so I imagine that is a discussion they will have with the landlord to determine how much has the landlord been able to recoup and can that be offset against any loss of rent claim that\u2019s been made.</p> \n  <p><strong>Leigh:</strong> Are you encouraging your members to pursue tenants? </p> \n  <p><strong>Whelan:</strong> No, we\u2019re not encouraging them to do so, but it is up to individual insurers to make their own arrangements with their relationship with the landlord. But it\u2019s really again around community expectations as well. But <strong>they are contracts at the end of the day that have been entered into, and the insurers are abiding by those contracts and so too the tenants should be as well. </strong></p> \n  <p><strong>Leigh: </strong>It hardly seems in the spirit of things though. There\u2019s a range of rent moratoriums that are being put in place as a result of Covid-19. Landlords are suffering some of that pain, and are then turning to their insurer, and you\u2019re telling me you think it would be alright if the insurer then went back and sued the tenant?</p> \n  <p><strong>Whelan</strong>: No, what I\u2019m saying is they need to take into account the community expectations and the degree to which they\u2019re able to absorb that is really their own individual decisions. That\u2019s something that the company must take onboard themselves and decide themselves. It is down to the individual companies to make those decisions. We encourage and provide information to them, but at the end of the day it\u2019s an individual company decision to make. </p> \n  <p><strong>Leigh:</strong> I think we can be pretty sure about what the community sentiment would be on this. I\u2019m just surprised that the Insurance Council doesn\u2019t have an approach to it, that you\u2019re essentially taking this hands off, \u2018it\u2019s up to our members\u2019 approach to what could turn out to be quite a serious problem.</p> \n  <p><strong>Whelan: </strong>Well, I wouldn\u2019t quite characterise it like that. We do monitor the situation and feed back what we believe are the issues that insurers should be taking into account when they are making these sorts of decisions. So it\u2019s not that we\u2019re absent in this discussion. We are participants in it obviously, because we want to make sure that the industry\u2019s reputation is held high. So that\u2019s an expectation on our behalf. And there\u2019s also a code of practise, which they\u2019re expected to abide by, which goes to issues around financial hardship and people in vulnerable positions. And that has some quite strong requirements on those particular companies to be able to abide by that code of practise.

  "<h2>Trump\u2019s focus on judges started back on the 2016 campaign trail</h2> <p>Donald Trump made many promises on the campaign trail in 2016. He promised to build a border wall and make Mexico pay for it. He promised to resurrect American industry.</p> <p>And he promised to fill the courts with conservative judges, understood to mean judges who were skeptical of environmental regulations, who were not enthralled with the legacy of the civil rights era and who took a narrow view of a woman\u2019s right to choose.</p> <p>To combat doubts about his conservative credentials, Trump took the unusual step of releasing, while still a candidate, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/18/donald-trump-supreme-court-picks-conservatives\">a list of his potential picks</a> for the US supreme court. The list was curated by the Federalist Society, the country\u2019s largest organization of conservative legal activists. For evangelical Christians and other groups, the list signaled that Trump was a safe White House pick.</p> <h2>Has Trump delivered on his promises on judges?</h2> <p>As Trump\u2019s first term winds down, there is no great border wall, and no resurgent manufacturing sector. But the highest hopes of Trump\u2019s evangelical supporters have been realized, as the president has made good on his promise to fill the federal bench with a new brand of conservative judge \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2020/01/28/judicial-appointments-in-trumps-first-three-years-myths-and-realities/\">younger</a>, more ideologically committed and <a href=\"https://www.acslaw.org/judicial-nominations/diversity-of-the-federal-bench/\">less diverse</a> than their peers.</p> <p>At the circuit court level, Trump has installed 51 judges, or about 30% of all active judgeships, just one step before the US supreme court. He is preparing to fill dozens of district court vacancies. Most significantly of all, Trump has appointed two justices to the supreme court, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, out of nine total.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/series/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Trump\u2019s%20court%20takeover&amp;description=This%20series%20examines%20the%20historic%20pace%20and%20nature%20of%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20remaking%20of%20the%20federal%20courts%20and%20the%20conservative%20agenda%20it%20will%20usher%20in%20on%20a%20range%20of%20issues%20from%20voting%20rights%20to%20climate%20and%20from%20healthcare%20to%20criminal%20justice&amp;read-more-link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2Fseries%2Ftrumps-court-takeover&amp;links=false\" data-alt=\"series linker\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/series/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&title=Trump\u2019s%20court%20takeover&description=This%20series%20examines%20the%20historic%20pace%20and%20nature%20of%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20remaking%20of%20the%20federal%20courts%20and%20the%20conservative%20agenda%20it%20will%20usher%20in%20on%20a%20range%20of%20issues%20from%20voting%20rights%20to%20climate%20and%20from%20healthcare%20to%20criminal%20justice&read-more-link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2Fseries%2Ftrumps-court-takeover&links=false\">series linker</a> </figure>  <h2>Are the judges powerful?</h2> <p>Together these judges wield immense power over who gets to vote, who gets to marry, who has access to healthcare, who carries a gun, who is branded a criminal, who may join a union, who is protected from discrimination and who has permission to discriminate on religious grounds.</p> <p>Pervasive influence on the federal judiciary is an immense prize, with implications spanning generations, given that federal judgeships are lifetime appointments. And it is a prize, analysts say, that Trump has handed the conservative movement, creating a powerful bulwark for his own political fortunes.</p> <p>\u201cThese judges have all been vetted in terms of judicial philosophy,\u201d said Sheldon Goldman, a professor of political science at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst who focuses on the federal bench. \u201cAll believe in a bench that is not activist in terms of promoting civil libertarian values. But they\u2019re activist judges in terms of promoting the values that are important to them \u2013 property rights, pro-business, anti-regulation.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"998d2b2e2bfc7702c3f35a0db12f8cd0fe4f9bb3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/998d2b2e2bfc7702c3f35a0db12f8cd0fe4f9bb3/0_44_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump\u2019s best friend in the effort to appoint judges has been Mitch McConnell.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump\u2019s best friend in the effort to appoint judges has been Mitch McConnell.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Brenner/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>How did Trump pick the judges?</strong></h2> <p>Trump\u2019s success at installing top-level judges \u2013 he has placed more, faster, than any previous president \u2013 has owed to the preparedness of outside groups in taking advantage of Republican control of both the presidency and the US Senate, which is in charge of confirming judges. Trump also has benefited from dozens of retirements by judges who were appointed by previous Republican presidents.</p> <p>But his best friend in the effort has been Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, who by blocking nominees under Barack Obama helped create 17 appeals court vacancies for Trump when he took office, more than any of his recent predecessors. McConnell also held a supreme court seat open for Trump, and he has changed Senate rules to speed the confirmation of Trump judges.</p> <h2>Have Trump\u2019s judges made any impact yet?</h2> <p>While experts advise that it could take five years or more for the full picture to develop of how Trump\u2019s judges are changing the courts, and the country, signs are emerging of a potential phase shift.</p> <p>Formerly reliable progressive benches have issued rulings that threaten access to reproductive healthcare, while others have greenlighted the Trump administration\u2019s most reckless attacks on voting rights and on vulnerable populations, from the disabled to victims of police abuse to asylum seekers.</p> <p>The supreme court, meanwhile, has consistently sided with Trump administration requests for emergency relief from lower court rulings against executive actions by Trump to create a wealth test for green card applicants, divert Pentagon funding for a border wall, ban transgender individuals from the military and more.</p> <h2>What is at stake in these changes?</h2> <p>Goldman expressed general confidence in the health of the judiciary and said many Trump judicial appointees were qualified for their posts. But he warned of dire consequences if Trump\u2019s judges gave in wholly to the president\u2019s desire to prosecute his political enemies and destroy the free press.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a president who has authoritarian instincts,\u201d said Goldman. \u201cWe have a president who is rather vindictive. That\u2019s really the big issue now \u2013 whether the constitution of the United States, the bill of rights, will survive Trump.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Whether or not he is re-elected, Donald Trump will be revered by conservatives for his judicial appointments. As of March, Trump has appointed 193 judges to the federal bench, with another 39 pending on the floor of the Senate or in the Senate judiciary committee. Those nominations will surely be acted on favorably by the Senate before 20 January 2021, when there may be a new president and a new Senate. There are another 38 district court vacancies awaiting nominations. In one presidential term, Trump may appoint up to 270 federal judges, or 31% of the entire federal judiciary. For perspective, Barack Obama appointed 329 in <em>eight</em> years.</p> <p>There is no doubt that the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, will confirm Trump\u2019s appointments until the very last day of his term. This is of course the same Senate gatekeeper who infamously blocked Obama\u2019s final supreme court nomination, Merrick Garland, <em>for an entire year \u2013 </em>on the ground that in the final year of a presidency, the Senate should await \u201cthe will of the people\u201d in the upcoming general election. But that was then. The rules have apparently changed. McConnell will pack the courts with \u201cright-thinking\u201d ideologues who will carry out Trump\u2019s agenda long after he has been subjected to the scorn of historical scrutiny.</p> <p>We now know a lot about Trump\u2019s judicial appointments. Eighty-five per cent are white and 76% are male. This is a significant step backward. Obama\u2019s judicial appointments were 64% white and 58% male. Today, after more than three years of Trump\u2019s appointments, the federal judiciary is 73% white and 66% male, but it will be even more male and pale by the end of his term. Even more troubling is the average age of the Trump judges. According to Brookings, the <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2020/01/28/judicial-appointments-in-trumps-first-three-years-myths-and-realities/\">median age</a> of Trump\u2019s judicial appointments by the beginning of his fourth year in office is 48.2. By the same time in his presidency, the median age of Obama\u2019s appointees was 57.2. This means that Trump judges will serve, on average, for 10 years more than the Obama judges.</p> <p>Statistics only tell part of the story. More important is the impact of these statistics on the critical issues that face the courts now and in the future. Courts should reflect the people they serve. I served as a federal district judge for 22 years. The vast majority of criminal defendants (in non-white-collar cases) were either African American or Hispanic, as were their family members. Plaintiffs in employment discrimination cases were overwhelmingly women, minorities or persons with disabilities. The same was true in actions involving prisoner rights, voting rights, housing discrimination and public benefits. Not all cases involve big corporations and business disputes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/series/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Trump\u2019s%20court%20takeover&amp;description=This%20series%20examines%20the%20historic%20pace%20and%20nature%20of%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20remaking%20of%20the%20federal%20courts%20and%20the%20conservative%20agenda%20it%20will%20usher%20in%20on%20a%20range%20of%20issues%20from%20voting%20rights%20to%20climate%20and%20from%20healthcare%20to%20criminal%20justice&amp;read-more-link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2Fseries%2Ftrumps-court-takeover&amp;links=false\" data-alt=\"series linker\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/series/index.html?vertical=News&opinion-tint=false&title=Trump\u2019s%20court%20takeover&description=This%20series%20examines%20the%20historic%20pace%20and%20nature%20of%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20remaking%20of%20the%20federal%20courts%20and%20the%20conservative%20agenda%20it%20will%20usher%20in%20on%20a%20range%20of%20issues%20from%20voting%20rights%20to%20climate%20and%20from%20healthcare%20to%20criminal%20justice&read-more-link=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2Fseries%2Ftrumps-court-takeover&links=false\">series linker</a> </figure>  <p>A diverse bench engenders trust and credibility. Many studies have shown that decision-makers reach better decisions when they bring a variety of experiences to their analysis. A 36-year-old lawyer who has never tried a case, has not represented individual clients, and has not spent years facing life\u2019s challenges is not well-positioned to decide on the length of a prison term, the need for access to healthcare, abortion, food stamps, Medicare or housing, or the impact of pollution or discrimination on working people\u2019s quality of life. It is for this reason the American Bar Association\u2019s standing committee on the federal judiciary insists that a candidate for judicial office have at least 12 years of experience <em>practicing</em> law \u2013 not talking about it as a speech writer, lobbyist or media star.</p> <p>When I was appointed to the bench I was 48. I had been a federal prosecutor, a defense lawyer, and had handled many civil cases in trial and appellate courts. That experience was invaluable. I knew both the substance and procedure of federal practice. The same cannot be said of many of Trump\u2019s nominees, whose only qualifications appear to be their consistently rightwing voting records.</p> <p>Consider the following four Trump judges, all of whom were appointed in their 30s. What they have in common is not their legal experience, but their outspoken support of Trump\u2019s political agenda. All were members of the Federalist Society or other rightwing organizations, clerked for conservative judges, and have written articles or advocated for legal positions that are vastly out of step with most Americans.</p> <p>Allison Rushing was 36 when she was confirmed to a seat on the fourth circuit court of appeals, 11 years after graduating from law school, and Trump\u2019s youngest nominee to a circuit court judgeship. She clerked for then-circuit judge Neil Gorsuch and for Justice Clarence Thomas. Her law practice during the remaining nine years was limited to representing big corporations at one of the nation\u2019s largest law firms.</p> <p>Andrew Brasher was 38 when he was confirmed to a seat on the 11th circuit court of appeals, after serving for only nine months on the district court for the middle district of Alabama. In the years just before his appointment he served as Alabama\u2019s solicitor general, often advocating for rightwing causes.</p> <p>Justin Walker, best known for his full-throated defense of Brett Kavanaugh (for whom he clerked), was appointed as a district judge in the western district of Kentucky, at 37, just 10 years after graduating law school. He is a protege of Mitch McConnell, who held up debate on a Covid-19 relief bill to attend Walker\u2019s induction ceremony. Less than six months after Walker took the bench, Trump announced that he intended to nominate him for an upcoming vacancy on the DC court of appeals.</p> <p>Patrick Wyrick was 38 when he was confirmed as a judge for the western district of Oklahoma. Four years after graduating law school he became the solicitor general of Oklahoma. He is a protege of Scott Pruitt, the disgraced former head of the Environmental Protection Agency.</p> <p>One of these judges could easily end up on the supreme court; two are known to be on the shortlist. All will probably still be on the bench 40 years from now. That alone should make voters think hard about the upcoming presidential election. As the saying goes: elections have consequences.</p> <ul> <li><p>Shira A Scheindlin served as a United States district judge for the southern district of New York for 22 years.

  "<p>If Ovidiu Olea is astonished by the fact that he\u2019s gone from being a finance guy to a mask mogul in four months, he shows no sign of it. The transition started innocuously. Late in January, when the coronavirus spread beyond Wuhan, Olea decided he would buy masks for his staff. He lives in Hong Kong, where he runs a payment technology firm. His staff isn\u2019t large \u2013 just 20 employees \u2013 but finding even a few hundred masks proved hard. Part of the problem was that last year, after protesters in Hong Kong used masks to hide their identity, the Chinese government restricted supplies from the mainland. Before the pandemic, half the world\u2019s masks were manufactured in China; now, with production there shifting into overdrive, that figure may be <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-the-richest-country-on-earth-cant-get-you-a-face-mask-11585741254\" title=\"\">as high as 85%</a>. If China isn\u2019t sending you masks, you likely aren\u2019t getting any at all. We have no masks, local pharmacies told Olea, but if you find some, we\u2019ll buy them from you.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/may/11/how-the-face-mask-became-the-worlds-most-coveted-commodity-podcast\">How the face mask became the world's most coveted commodity \u2013 podcast</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Olea got to work. In a journal article, he read that epidemiologists spoke highly of N95 respirators, masks that filter out 95% of small particulate matter. Stealing time out of his day job, Olea began phoning N95 suppliers in Mexico, Turkey, Indonesia, Ireland. Each one turned him down. \u201cThe answers ranged from \u2018No\u2019 to \u2018We only sell to accredited buyers\u2019 to \u2018Come back next year,\u2019\u201d Olea told me. After three days, Olea found a South African firm named North Safety Products, which had 500,000 masks in stock. Olea bought them all, at less than a pound per mask, certain that he would be able to sell the surplus.</p> \n<p>During their conversations, North Safety Products executives warned Olea to be careful. There were \u201cinterested parties\u201d lurking outside its factory gates, ready to bribe truck drivers for their cargoes. Olea hired a security detail to ride alongside his truck of masks as it drove to the airport in Johannesburg. (He sent me a photo of the team: six grim men packing pistols and rifles, clad in camo and bulletproof vests. \u201cThey asked if I wanted machine guns as well. I thought not. We\u2019re not invading Lesotho. Let\u2019s keep it reasonable.\u201d) In mid-February, two weeks after he placed his order, his shipment touched down in Hong Kong. Within six hours, the buyers he had signed up had collected nearly all of the masks. \u201cEven if I\u2019d had 5m masks,\u201d Olea said, \u201cI\u2019d have sold out.\u201d</p> \n<p>Olea, who has a keen nose for business opportunities, quickly became possessed by this new line of work. Since February, as the pandemic has streaked around the planet, he has bought and sold on another million N95 masks from North Safety Products. In March, Olea became a middleman for Chinese-made three-ply masks, too, the simple kind that just about everyone everywhere is now opting to wear. He sold masks to the Hong Kong government, to European countries, via their diplomats in Hong Kong and China, and to European companies, which wanted them for their employees. All told, Olea reckons he\u2019s sold about 48m of them.</p> \n<p>By April, Olea decided he might as well take the next step. He bought a mask-making machine from a Chinese manufacturer: an eight-metre-long assembly line, which shapes and cuts sheets of plastic into masks. When I spoke to him, in mid-April, I was reading about mask prices close to \u00a36 a pop, and Olea was waiting with giddy excitement for his machine to reach him. He was still running his payments firm, and masks were a departure from that work. \u201cBut these are weird times,\u201d he insisted. \u201cWe all must do something to survive.\u201d</p> \n<p>No object better symbolises the pandemic than the mask, and no object better explains the world into which the pandemic arrived. Social distancing, at first, felt like a strange notion: the inaction of it, the vagueness of it. But the mask sang out to our deepest consumeristic impulses. In the absence of a drug or a vaccine, the mask is the only material protection we can buy; it\u2019s a product, and we\u2019ve been trained like seals to respond to products. As a result, in every corner of every country, the humble face mask \u2013 this assembly of inexpensive plastic \u2013 has been elevated into a fetishised commodity. One mask broker described it as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/market-for-chinese-made-masks-is-a-madhouse-says-broker\" title=\"\">a madhouse</a>\u201d, another as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/daviddisalvo/2020/03/30/i-spent-a-day-in-the-coronavirus-driven-feeding-frenzy-of-n95-mask-sellers-and-buyers-and-this-is-what-i-learned/#199e11b356d4\" title=\"\">the craziest market I\u2019ve ever seen</a>\u201d.</p> \n<p>Countries have hoarded masks, and used them as chips in geopolitical games. Thieves have made off with them. Prada, Gucci and Balenciaga have started to manufacture them. We already have MaskClub.com which, like a \u201cjam of the month\u201d club, offers $9.99-a-month mask subscriptions: the best-beloved business model of hipster e-commerce. Last year, an industry insider told me, Burberry had toyed with the notion of putting face masks on some of its models during a catwalk show \u2013 a wink, perhaps, at our apocalyptic future. By March, things had become real, and the fashion house <a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2020/03/30/burberry-making-gowns-masks-nhs-12479187/\" title=\"\">was pledging</a> to make masks and gowns for the UK\u2019s NHS. From a healthcare perspective, the mask was a matter of life and death. But it also took on the function of a talisman \u2013 as an object to hang comfortingly between the body and a diseased society.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e0e4b23bea5e8f048388e938d8d19e552e768430\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e0e4b23bea5e8f048388e938d8d19e552e768430/0_0_6720_4480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protective masks hang in a decontamination unit in Somerville, Massachusetts.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protective masks hang in a decontamination unit in Somerville, Massachusetts.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Dwyer/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>All this when no one even seemed to know precisely how useful masks were, or who should wear them. The advice we got was a mess. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/apr/10/world-health-organization-who-v-coronavirus-why-it-cant-handle-pandemic\" title=\"\">World Health Organization</a> maintained, at first, that healthy people had no need for masks. But people bought masks anyway. Shelves were emptied. People improvised. A friend of mine in Tel Aviv ended up fashioning one for herself out of her husband\u2019s boxer shorts \u2013 washed and dried, she assured me, and slid over her head like a balaclava. Then, in early April, the WHO reversed its counsel, and a host of governments followed suit, which sparked a fresh run on mask stocks.</p> \n<p>In this pandemic, the mask reveals far more than it hides. It exposes the world\u2019s political and economic relations for what they are: vectors of self-interest that ordinarily lie obscured under glib talk of globalisation and openness. For the demagogues who govern so much of the world, the pandemic has provided an unimpeachable excuse to fulfil their dearest wishes: to nail national borders shut, to tar every outsider as suspicious, and to act as if their own countries must be preserved above all others.</p> \n<p>When these tendencies combine with a fawning loyalty to the free market, the results can be ruinous. In mere weeks, the mask went from being an urgent human need to a cynically exploited asset in a global resource grab \u2013 the fastest such journey, perhaps, of any product in history. Sometimes, it felt as if the mask itself was beside the point \u2013 that it was just a trigger to rehearse old routines of acquisitiveness and discord, with no further, greater end in sight.</p> \n<h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> \n<p>We\u2019ve been living with the coronavirus long enough now that we can distinguish the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2020/apr/23/coronavirus-face-masks-around-the-world-in-pictures\" title=\"\">various tribes</a> of mask-wearers. Note the shopper in the pasta aisle, clad in a classic white N95 with the 3M manufacturer logo just under the snout. The N95 and its equivalents keep out nearly every particle larger than 0.3 microns, and although the virus is tinier, the fibres in the mask\u2019s layers obstruct its passage. These masks are meant to go first to healthcare workers, which might explain the shopper\u2019s furtive, guilty eyes. Note the finance bro out for his allotted hour of jogging, wearing a Vogmask \u2013 a brand so stylish that its midnight-blue model might even match his suit when he eventually returns to the City. Note the extreme worrier in the GVS Elipse P100, the heavy-duty mask that promises to keep out 99.97% of particles. In the age of Covid-19, the equivalent of sensible shoes may be the simple surgical mask or the home-hemmed cloth. The gaps in their weave are big enough for the virus to pass through, but they do at least protect others from the wearer\u2019s sneezes and coughs.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5d25beb5-14fb-47b4-bd06-0714dbfabc04\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cqLnDhHSJDU?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Such deep familiarity with masks is hard-won. The pandemic has brought on a global shortage of masks, which is really a global shortage of one particular plastic inside the masks \u2013 a type of non-woven polypropylene that acts as a filter. In casual conversation, people in the mask business call the plastic \u201cmeltblown\u201d, referring to how its plastic filaments are made. Meltblown goes into many things: jackets, nappies, filters in water purifiers and air conditioners. Masks are in short supply not because they\u2019re difficult to produce, but because the meltblown industry is used to stable, long-term demand. It churns out just enough for its customers and no more. To install an assembly line of meltblown takes many months, even at the calmest of times; with demand now soaring, some companies supplying meltblown equipment are quoting timelines of up to two years to even deliver a new machine.</p> \n<p>Hot out of the plant, meltblown looks like a giant toilet roll: 15,000 yards or so of polypropylene wrapped around a cardboard core. The material feels like synthetic cloth, but it\u2019s so thin that you might accidentally put your finger through it, an executive at one American meltblown manufacturer told me. He asked to keep his and his company\u2019s names out of this article, for a reason I\u2019ve never been given before. They don\u2019t want to be known more widely, he said: \u201cWe\u2019re so overburdened with enquiries already. If any further information gets out, that\u2019s another thousand messages coming in every day. That makes it impossible to do any work.\u201d Until last year, just 2 or 3% of his company\u2019s meltblown went into face masks, he said. This year, it\u2019s 95%.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"16aebaf27d74fc9aaa773114022c1c07576baae1\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/16aebaf27d74fc9aaa773114022c1c07576baae1/0_301_4941_2966/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Manufacturing of meltblown fabric for use in face masks in Chengdu, China.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Manufacturing of meltblown fabric for use in face masks in Chengdu, China.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chine Nouvelle/SIPA/REX/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Until now, countries didn\u2019t consider meltblown a strategic commodity, so during the past three decades, much of its production has migrated from the west to low-cost factories in Asia. The executive\u2019s company is one of just five or 10 remaining manufacturers in the US, he said, and China produces close to half of all the meltblown in the world. As a result, the rush for masks provided a compressed, vivid reminder of something we\u2019d been aware of for a couple of decades now: that in all manufacturing and trade, the lines of commerce inevitably bend towards China.</p> \n<p>Early in February, the Chinese government began preventing exports of meltblown, so that the material could first be used to assemble masks for China\u2019s own population. The prospect of being cut off from half the world\u2019s meltblown supply \u201cput the fear of God\u201d into everyone who manufactured anything that contained it, the executive said. The market price of meltblown went up fourfold. He began to get 200 or 300 phone calls a day from mask companies all over the world, demanding meltblown. Even Chinese mask manufacturers rang him, worried that their country might run out. They\u2019d offer cash up front and try to outbid each other. \u201cThey\u2019d say: \u2018Name your price, any price you want to, anything,\u2019 and I\u2019d explain that we don\u2019t do it that way,\u201d said the executive. Then they dangled bribes before him: all-expenses-paid holidays. Just tell us where you want to go.</p> \n<p>Also in February, the Chinese government effectively made itself the sole customer of the major mask-making factories in its territory. This applied to Chinese-owned companies, but also to big mask plants in China owned by foreign firms; their products were earmarked for domestic use and banned from being shipped overseas. On 3 February, in <a href=\"https://guide.jsp.co.uk/statement/JSP%20Coronavirus%20Statement%203%20February%202020.pdf\" title=\"\">an apologetic letter</a> to customers, the British company JSP Safety said that its output of masks was running low, because two of its Chinese factories had been \u201cformally requisitioned by the government to make disposable RPE [respiratory protection equipment] for Chinese government agencies\u201d.</p> \n<p>Christopher Dobbing, who founded the Cambridge Mask Company in 2015, said his own factory in China was small enough to escape the government\u2019s notice, so his inventory wasn\u2019t snapped up by the authorities. But he did see, first-hand, the wave of Chinese panic-buying. \u201cChinese communities everywhere snapped up our masks wherever we had a footprint, so that they could send them home,\u201d Dobbing said. Chinese companies overseas <a href=\"http://www.chinaisa.org.cn/gxportal/xfgl/portal/content.html?articleId=4e44369ab9d5797768fa034525b2aad5c816782b7dd0ee3c401cfc3af43c1c3a&amp;columnId=58af05dfb6b4300151760176d2aad0a04c275aaadbb1315039263f021f920dcd\" title=\"\">were also</a> <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-07/china-implores-employees-and-clients-to-scour-world-for-masks\" title=\"\">asked</a> to purchase and ship back masks. On 26 January, Dobbing got 1,200 emails and 400 phone calls. \u201cMaybe they thought we were a huge company, but we were just a couple of guys in an office, panicking as the orders flowed in.\u201d By 28 January, he was taking pre-orders for March.</p> \n<p>Roughly 2bn masks were imported into China in February. To those with a kneejerk mistrust of China\u2019s rulers, it appeared as if, having first failed to contain the disease, they were now ransacking the mask market just when the coronavirus was starting to race through other nations. After a Chinese real-estate company in Sydney <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/coronavirus-doctors-issue-protective-equipment-warning-after-report-china-backed-firm-sourced-bulk-supplies-from-sydney\" title=\"\">was discovered</a> to have bought millions of masks, the Australian Medical Association urged its government to keep protective gear safe from foreign buyers. A lawyer attached to Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2020/04/05/trump-admin-weighs-legal-action-over-alleged-chinese-hoarding-of-ppe/\" title=\"\">compared</a> China\u2019s actions to \u201cfirst-degree murder\u201d and wondered aloud if the US could sue Beijing. The US state of Missouri then went on to do just that, arguing in its <a href=\"https://ago.mo.gov/docs/default-source/press-releases/2019/prc-complaint.pdf?sfvrsn=86ae7ab_2\" title=\"\">lawsuit</a> that China had \u201choarded personal protective equipment \u2013 thus causing a global pandemic that was unnecessary and preventable\u201d.</p> \n<p>But for the US and the rest of the west to complain about China aggressively pursuing its own interests is, in one way, to engage in a fundamental duplicity. China\u2019s wealth and power are the result of a longstanding international consensus championed by the US: that the quest for the lowest possible cost of production and the highest possible profit is paramount. According to this philosophy, if that means offshoring nearly everything to China, nothing must be allowed to stand in the way: not the hollowing-out of industry at home, or the loss of livelihoods, or human-rights concerns. And it isn\u2019t just China that has prospered from this arrangement. It has also been good to the richest people in the richest countries. Many of those same people now seem affronted by the world they helped create.</p> \n<p>As events transpired, few large nations behaved very differently from China once the disease blazed up within their own borders. \u201cA dog-eat-dog world is back,\u201d one former Polish diplomat <a href=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/amid-coronavirus-a-dog-eat-dog-world-is-back/\" title=\"\">lamented</a>, as if such a world had ever gone anywhere in the first place.</p> \n<h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> \n<p>By mid-March, China had relaxed its rules, allowing both masks and meltblown to be sold overseas again, to nations that were now in dire need of pandemic gear. But the market kept failing: supplies of masks often didn\u2019t make it to doctors, nurses, the elderly and others who required them most.</p> \n<p>During the great global scrum that followed, governments used every conceivable means to get hold of masks for their citizens before they went elsewhere. Foreign embassies in China turned their diplomatic staff <a href=\"https://www.financialexpress.com/defence/coronavirus-mea-plays-proactive-role-in-fight-against-covid-19/1938679/\" title=\"\">into scouts</a> for medical supplies; Canada hired a multinational consulting firm to help <a href=\"https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-building-own-ppe-supply-chain-in-china-1.5530259\" title=\"\">figure out</a> which manufacturers could be trusted. Freight agents in China, who book space on ships and planes for goods leaving the country, found themselves handling medical equipment and little else. One agent in Shanghai, Fredrik Barner, had been shipping auto parts until this spring, when he was flooded with orders to move masks instead. \u201cI\u2019ve been in the industry for 10 years and I\u2019ve never seen such high air-freight rates,\u201d Barner told me. \u201cNormally, the rate is around $3 or $4 a kilogram. That went up to $17 or $18.\u201d</p> \n<p>Nations that couldn\u2019t make enough masks for themselves had to find unconventional ways to bring them in from China. In Ireland, the government asked Aer Lingus to run supplies out of Beijing. The airline had never flown to China before, and the planning and approvals for a new route would usually have taken six months. Aer Lingus did it in a week. Brian O\u2019Sullivan, Aer Lingus\u2019s chief flying instructor, captained the first plane to Beijing on 27 March, taking with him four other pilots, two engineers and a specialist in balancing loads in an airplane. Ten hours out, six hours on the ground, then 13 hours back: the kind of flight schedule that is, for a single crew, inconceivable in regular aviation.</p> \n<p>They landed in Beijing very early on a Sunday morning. Through the plane\u2019s open door, O\u2019Sullivan noticed that the airport, which usually buzzes like a beehive with flights landing and taking off, was practically in hibernation; in six hours, he saw just half a dozen or so departures. His crew never left the aircraft, O\u2019Sullivan told me, because that would have required them to go into quarantine. Instead, they stayed in business class, behind thick plastic drapes, while ground handlers loaded first the cargo hold and then economy class: huge green bags filled with masks, gowns and gloves were strapped into the seats, as if the cabin had been booked out by gigantic pods of peas. \u201cWe didn\u2019t shake hands with anyone,\u201d O\u2019Sullivan said, \u201cbut there were plenty of smiles and thankyous and nodding heads.\u201d When I spoke to him in mid-April, Aer Lingus had completed 30 Beijing flights, and expected to run another 200 or so by the end of May.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Get the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-long-read\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Long Read email\u201d data-form-description=\u201cGet the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\u201d scrolling=\" no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>To meet the rush for masks, a strange alternate ecosystem of suppliers sprang up, often supplying products of dubious quality. In Europe, several buyers of Chinese masks found their products to be sub-standard. The Dutch government had to recall 600,000 masks. Finland <a href=\"https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/04/09/finland-discovers-masks-bought-from-china-not-hospital-safe.html\" title=\"\">discovered</a> that an order of 2m surgical masks, which are discarded after use with a single patient, weren\u2019t good enough for hospital wear. Even if they had been up to scratch, those 2m masks would have only met the country\u2019s needs for four days.</p> \n<p>It wasn\u2019t always clear who was producing these masks. Being in the trade, Christopher Dobbing got a number of emails throughout March and April from Chinese mask vendors he\u2019d never heard of before. He sent me a few of them, and I rang one of the listed numbers, in the city of Zhangjiagang, 100 miles or so from Shanghai. A woman picked up and introduced herself as Rita. She told me that the company she worked for had been selling K95 masks since the first week of March, for $2.50 a pop. I asked if they manufactured the masks as well.</p> \n<p>She laughed. \u201cNo, we make tin plate. But our clients in America and Europe asked if we could source masks, so we do that now,\u201d she told me. \u201cWe get them from a big factory nearby, which makes masks.\u201d</p> \n<p>I asked how long it would take to send 10,000 masks to London. She couldn\u2019t say. There weren\u2019t many flights out of the country, and after some batches of exported masks had been found to be defective, Chinese customs authorities were inspecting mask cargoes more rigorously. A friend of hers, another mask vendor, had been waiting two weeks already for one of her shipments to clear customs, she told me.</p> \n<p>The factory that actually made the masks belonged to another company, Rita said. Chinese manufacturers that produce masks for medical use in the west must be certified by government health agencies such as the US Food and Drug Administration. Rita assured me that the manufacturer had an FDA certificate, and she emailed me a scan to prove it. It had been issued on 1 April. In the space where the manufacturer\u2019s name should have been displayed, there was just a short span of white space followed by the generic words Technology Co., Ltd. It looked like any company might print its name into the blank space and make the certificate its own. On the FDA\u2019s database, I looked up the certificate\u2019s number. The FDA had awarded it to Jiangsu Newborn Medical Technology Co, Ltd \u2013 a different company altogether.</p> \n<p>Among those tempted to reinvent themselves as mask merchants were drug dealers, who used the crisis to diversify their portfolio. Logan Pauley, a researcher at the Center for Advanced Defense Studies in Washington DC, tracks the sales of illicit drugs on the internet, focusing on trafficking from east Asia to the rest of the world. Towards the end of February, he noticed that some of the dealers he monitors were advertising masks and gloves. He sent me screenshots. \u201cMask, 3ply, 50pcs per box, 20 box min. $33.50 per box, exclude shipping charges,\u201d ran one Facebook post by a user named Vicky, in a group where people otherwise offer fentanyl for sale.</p> \n<p>It was difficult to know how to feel about these transactions, Pauley said. On the one hand, Vicky\u2019s masks might well be of terrible quality, and there was a danger that the masks would be deliberately mislabelled, whisked through US customs, and then sold on to US hospitals short of gear. \u201cCustoms is swamped right now,\u201d said Pauley. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to be opening and checking every box.\u201d On the other hand, he said, the FDA and other international authorities that license medical supplies \u201chave made it difficult, in this time of need, to get new suppliers approved in a timely fashion. If the masks are good, the hospital may be paying three times the price for them, but it\u2019s still better than waiting for FDA approvals.\u201d</p> \n<p>He was right. If I\u2019d been a hospital administrator in critical need of masks, perhaps I\u2019d have placed an order with one of these shadowy brokers. In the absence of government supplies or a well-ordered mask market, the seediest corners of the internet seemed to offer one of the few ways to find any masks at all.</p> \n<h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> \n<p>Alongside the new mask middlemen and the criminal elements finding a fresh vocation, there were the groups who had never fabricated a mask before, but who had a sure sense of money to be made. From February onwards, legions of new mask-makers emerged, of every size and shape: from big companies such as BMW to the amateurs the meltblown executive characterised as \u201cfour neighbours in a cul-de-sac in Los Angeles, who\u2019ve gone on to the internet to learn about sewing masks\u201d. A face mask-making machine costs about $100,000, he told me, and it makes about 70,000-100,000 masks a day. He has received at least 200 enquiries from Americans who are importing machines from China \u2013 \u201cpeople who just have 100K to spend and a bit of space, and want to make some money.\u201d</p> \n<p>You\u2019d like to think they have some experience doing this, he said, but many of them don\u2019t know a thing. They ring him when they\u2019re expecting a new machine in three weeks, to ask vaguely for mask textile.</p> \n<p>\u201cDo you want meltblown?\u201d he asks them.</p> \n<p>\u201cYes.\u201d</p> \n<p>What about noseclips? What about spun-bound polypropylene, the plastic that encases the melt-blown?</p> \n<p>\u201cOh, we need to get some of that, too, do we?\u201d</p> \n<p>And then, the executive said to me with a sigh: \u201cI have to spend half an hour teaching them about mask manufacturing.\u201d</p> \n<p>All these breakdowns in the market \u2013 the hospitals without masks, the bogus gear, the exorbitant prices, the hoarding, the fly-by-night profiteers \u2013 seem to expose the limits of orthodox economics. The most ardent devotees of the free market believe that supply and demand solve every basic problem if they\u2019re permitted to work unconstrained. When demand is high, the price climbs, and the prospect of profit brings in a host of new suppliers. With time, the market rewards those who sell good products and punishes those who sell poor ones; with time, the price settles so that it allocates products most efficiently to those who value them most.</p> \n<p>That\u2019s the theory, anyway, and its advocates insist that it applies even in a crisis. In 2012, for instance, researchers at the University of Chicago asked eminent economists for their opinions on Connecticut\u2019s plan to outlaw price-gouging \u2013 exploitatively high prices \u2013 during floods or other weather cataclysms. Seventy-seven <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=JwfFDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA82&amp;lpg=PA82&amp;dq=connecticut+2012+price+gouging+weather&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DpDYaMSZDs&amp;sig=ACfU3U1edKBXJpI4IT5ntHyRR69cgTO2eQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjVkrK1rfnoAhWyunEKHXzbDm0Q6AEwB3oECAkQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=connecticut%202012%20price%20gouging%20weather&amp;f=false\" title=\"\">percent</a> of the economists thought that governments shouldn\u2019t curb or interfere with prices \u2013 that, all things considered, the best way to get vital goods to those who needed them was to put no reins on the market at all.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e2b9a315c5d597cb77a8da5dda99dd13199ac2c4\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2b9a315c5d597cb77a8da5dda99dd13199ac2c4/0_0_4000_2667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vendors selling masks at the roadside in Los Angeles this week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vendors selling masks at the roadside in Los Angeles this week.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Vogel/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But this pandemic has provided a huge weight of evidence to the contrary: tales <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/coronavirus-indonesia-seizes-half-a-million-masks-amid-panic-buying\" title=\"\">of</a> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/nyregion/brooklyn-coronavirus-price-gouging.html\" title=\"\">hoarders</a>, of doctors and nurses so short of protective gear that some wore <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/nurse-at-brooklyn-hospital-on-coronavirus-protective-clothing-its-a-garbage-bag-its-like-something-out-of-the-twlight-zone-2020-04-07\" title=\"\">bin bags</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/01/nhs-staff-making-masks-from-snorkels-amid-ppe-shortages\" title=\"\">snorkels</a>, and of deals so desperate that a <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/the-trump-administration-paid-a-bankrupt-company-with-zero-employees-2455-million-for-n95-masks-which-its-never-manufactured/ar-BB12JwUk\" title=\"\">security training company</a>, bankrupt for months and with no employees, somehow won a $55m contract to supply masks. These failures happen, in part, because ordinarily the market\u2019s idea of efficiency involves getting products to those willing to pay the most for them. In a crisis, or even outside of one, that isn\u2019t the same as getting products to the maximum possible number of people who need them.</p> \n<p>\u201cI have always thought that economists were obsessed with efficiency, no matter what happened to distribution,\u201d Angus Deaton, the Nobel-winning economist, told me. But distribution is what matters, particularly in an emergency. During this pandemic, the best scenario for everyone would be to get masks to doctors and nurses first \u2013 \u201cwe want to keep them well, so that they can save our lives and the lives of others,\u201d said Nicholas Bloom, a Stanford economist who studies periods of panic and uncertainty. But high prices in unregulated markets keeps masks out of reach for the hospitals that need them. By the time the market culls bad suppliers, stabilises the price and compels hoarders to sell, the disease has spread and people have died.</p> \n<p>Solving this, Bloom said, requires a hand on the tiller: steering the market in ways that classical economists tend to dislike. One strategy is to cap prices so that they don\u2019t become exorbitant but still offer the kind of profits that draw new manufacturers in. Bloom also thinks governments should requisition masks for their health services first, before allowing the rest into the market. \u201cIt\u2019s no different from how food was rationed during the world wars. Or how Britain bought tanks from Vickers during the second world war. It didn\u2019t have to take over the firm. It just offered a fair price. This is the same,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is like an economy in wartime.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> \n<p>For anyone who views the prevailing international order as a brutish contest for resources, disguised occasionally by noble words and fine treaties, the scramble for masks offers a perfect little parable. It has taken on the appearance of a zero-sum struggle straight out of a game-theory seminar: with limited supply and endless demand, one mask for you is one mask less for me. To this austere truth, nations have reacted in familiar ways; amid the novel chaos created by Covid-19, old enmities and hardened habits reassert themselves.</p> \n<p>So when, in early April, news anchors in Pakistan <a href=\"https://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ani/covid-19-china-buffoons-all-weather-ally-pakistan-by-sending-underwear-masks-120040500163_1.html\" title=\"\">complained</a> that China had sent their country masks made out of underwear, Indian nationalists on Twitter launched a mocking <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/underwear_mask_for_pakistan\" title=\"\">hashtag</a>. A couple of weeks before that, when British tabloids reported on French border guards impounding two trucks of masks earmarked for the NHS, it confirmed the worst suspicions of every Eurosceptic. \u201cThis shows you all you need to know about European cooperation,\u201d Iain Duncan Smith, the former Tory leader and ardent Brexiter, told the Sun. When the EU did<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/uk-missed-three-chances-to-join-eu-scheme-to-bulk-buy-ppe\" title=\"\"> invite Britain to take part</a> in a bulk purchase of protective apparel and ventilators, though, the government passed. The reason appears to be either the stubbornness of its Brexit spirit or its ineptitude in checking its email; both seem equally possible under Boris Johnson\u2019s government.</p> \n<p>The US, for its part, treated the procurement of masks as a smash-and-grab operation. In <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/global-battle-coronavirus-equipment-masks-tests\" title=\"\">April</a>, an incredible account emerged of Americans brandishing cash on the runway of a Shanghai airport, buying up a cargo of masks that was already on a plane, ready to fly out to France. No one quite clarified who these Americans were, or how they barged onto the runway, but the episode enraged French officials. In its wake, Renaud Muselier, the president of the regional council of Provence-Alpes-C\u00f4te d\u2019Azur, chose to bring his masks home by sea. \u201cAt least that way, I can be sure nobody will steal my masks from the tarmac,\u201d he told a French TV station.</p> \n<p>The US was also accused of waylaying masks in Bangkok before they flew on to Germany, and of blocking the delivery of 3m American-made masks to Canada. Last month, Ovidiu Olea, the Hong Kong entrepreneur, purchased 50,000 sets of masks, gloves and coveralls, which he planned to donate to the health service in his native Romania. \u201cEverything else was ready, and then my coveralls supplier called to say that some Americans showed up, paid three times the price, and bought my order out from under my nose,\u201d he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"6a6386814815c1bf68619fe7240279974679b378\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6a6386814815c1bf68619fe7240279974679b378/0_0_5568_3712/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Germany\u2019s defence minister welcoming a shipment of 10 million masks and other protective items from China in Leipzig this week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Germany\u2019s defence minister welcoming a shipment of 10 million masks and other protective items from China in Leipzig this week.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jens Schlueter/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In the EU, relations between member nations have prickled with tension over the lack of masks and other gear. By the end of February, there were more than 1,000 coronavirus cases across Italy, and it needed more protective gear \u2013 masks in particular. Around that time, a legislator in Italy\u2019s coalition government told me, France and Germany implemented national laws that declared masks as strategic assets, which meant that if masks were transiting through these countries, bound for elsewhere, they could be appropriated. For a while, she said, France and Germany kept hold of some masks that Italy had ordered from India, Turkey and Vietnam.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn those darkest moments, China stepped in and offered 200,000 masks as a present,\u201d the legislator said. A plane landed in Rome, carrying masks and gear but also traditional Chinese herbs: an exercise in what has come to be known as \u201cmask diplomacy\u201d. Not long afterwards, France and Germany lifted their mask seizure laws and sent free masks to Italy. But by that point, the legislator said, \u201cthe damage had been done\u201d.</p> \n<p>Since then, Italy has bought more than 20m masks from China, but China has been expert at projecting these sales as an extension of its benevolence. The Chinese government now buys full newspaper pages for advertorials that laud its assistance to Italy. After we spoke, the legislator texted me an opinion poll by an Italian thinktank, in which 52% of respondents named China as Italy\u2019s best friend. \u201cLook at the list of enemies,\u201d she wrote. On top: Germany at 45% and then France at 38%.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s alarming,\u201d she said, \u201chow the public isn\u2019t seeing that European institutions are actually doing a lot for Italy.\u201d Germany reserved dozens of intensive-care beds for Italians, flew them in for treatment and delivered ventilators to Italian hospitals; France sent hundreds of thousands of protective suits. But China\u2019s mask diplomacy has fanned a mistrust of the EU kindled years ago by Italy\u2019s populists. The legislator sounded despondent. \u201cI wish I could say this mask diplomacy isn\u2019t working very well. But it is, unfortunately.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> \n<p>Whatever the new normal is after this pandemic, everyone I spoke with agreed on one thing: there will be masks. Lots and lots of masks. They\u2019ll be handed out on airlines and at hotels; they\u2019ll be stacked next to the till at Boots; they\u2019ll be stashed in sock drawers and linen closets in practically every home. Every country will produce and stockpile its own supply, unwilling to rely any more on the vagaries of the international market; Germany, forever ahead of the curve, has already <a href=\"https://www.thelocal.de/20200408/highly-likely-that-face-mark-requirement-will-come-to-germany-says-bavarian-president\" title=\"\">begun</a>.</p> \n<p>We already guessed, before the pandemic, that one version of our future would entail masks for billions of us. It\u2019s the version in which we keep burning carbon, polluting our air and aggravating global warming so much that our land keeps going up in flames. But that still felt distant enough to be somewhat avoidable. We could hope that, however slowly or inexpertly, countries would pool their energies to stop this. Now, though, the age of masks has arrived sooner than we anticipated, brought on by an entirely different threat altogether. And the manner of its arrival carries a warning: that with the world as it is, the solidarity needed to battle climate change may be impossible to secure, and that the future of smoky skies and rising seas is the only one that lies ahead of us.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/14/how-coronavirus-almost-brought-down-the-global-financial-system\">How coronavirus almost brought down the global financial system | Adam Tooze</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Ovidiu Olea\u2019s mask machine arrived from China on the third Monday of April.

He has rented some space in a former bottling plant, but he hasn\u2019t begun manufacturing yet. He wants to make medical-grade gear, and for that he needs to set up a clean room and sterilisation facilities. If all goes to plan, his first masks will roll off the line in mid-summer.</p> \n<p>He wasn\u2019t worried about the delay. However outlandish the circumstances that cast Olea as mask manufacturer, he was still preparing to settle into the role for the foreseeable future. He didn\u2019t think Covid-19 was going to disappear any time soon. \u201cI think it\u2019ll end up being some sort of seasonal disease \u2013 like the flu, but with harsher consequences,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd this disease has changed attitudes towards mask-wearing. Earlier, people in Italy would giggle at the sight of Chinese tourists walking around wearing masks.

The estimates vary depending on the number, speed, and severity of infections, of course, but even the availability of testing affects the number of ventilators needed.... current estimates of the number of ventilators in the United States range from 60,000 to 160,000, depending on whether those that have only partial functionality are included.

Biden\u2019s campaign has denied the allegation. </p> \n  <p>In an interview with Business Insider, a former neighbor of Reade\u2019s said Reade shared details of the alleged assault with her in the mid-1990s.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThis happened, and I know it did because I remember talking about it,\u201d the neighbor, Lynda LaCasse, told the website.</p> \n  <p>The other woman, Lorraine Sanchez, a colleague of Reade\u2019s in the office of a California state senator in the mid-1990s, told the website that she remembers Reade complaining that she had been fired after complaining about a former boss in Washington DC who had sexually harassed her.</p> \n  <p>In April 2019, Reade was among several women who came forward to accuse Biden of inappropriate behavior or conduct that made them feel uncomfortable. But last month, in a podcast interview with progressive media host Katie Halper, Reade made a much more serious allegation. </p> \n  <p>She said Biden cornered her in a semi-private corridor on Capitol Hill, pinned her against the wall and digitally penetrated her. She repeated the story to The Intercept, The New York Times and The Washington Post. Reade\u2019s brother and a friend who has remained anonymous have confirmed aspects of her story. Reade also said she told her mother, who is deceased. </p> \n  <p>This weekend video archive emerged of a woman Reade identified as her mother calling into CNN\u2019s Larry King Live in 1993 to discuss what Reade said was a reference to her claim.

Coronavirus taskforce members were said to be stunned. For White House aides and Republican allies, it was reportedly the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back: these daily briefings had become a political liability that could cost Trump the presidential election.</p> <p>So there was no briefing on Saturday, nor on Sunday. The official White House guidance said there would be one on Monday. At 9.41am, Trump, whose very self-conception is based on what he sees reflected back through the media, tweeted: \u201cThere has never been, in the history of our Country, a more vicious or hostile Lamestream Media than there is right now, even in the midst of a National Emergency, the Invisible Enemy!\u201d</p> <p>At 10.52am, the briefing was abruptly cancelled without explanation. But at 1.32pm, it was officially back on again, scheduled for the rose garden at 5pm. As a poet once wrote, \u201cWho is in charge of the clattering train?\u201d</p> <p>It turned out the rose garden was decked out with a red carpet and US national flags. Corporate chief executives gave remarks. Trump did not advise anyone to inject disinfectant into their veins, nor did he berate some hapless journalist as \u201ca third rate reporter\u201d, but it could hardly be described as the long-yearned-for \u201cpivot\u201d to a presidential mien.</p> <p>Stung, perhaps, by <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/13-hours-of-trump-the-president-fills-briefings-with-attacks-and-boasts-but-little-empathy/2020/04/25/7eec5ab0-8590-11ea-a3eb-e9fc93160703_story.html\">a Washington Post analysis</a> that found over the past three weeks of briefings Trump spent two hours on attacks, 45 minutes praising himself and his administration and just 4\u00bd minutes expressing condolences for coronavirus victim, he read scripted remarks as usual before adding: \u201cWe do grieve.\u201d</p> <p>He went on to script a political attack ad against himself: \u201cThere has been so much unnecessary death in this country. It could have been stopped and it could have been stopped short, but somebody a long time ago, it seems, decided not to do it that way. And the whole world is suffering because of it. 184 countries, at least.\u201d</p> <p>In his old self-promotional style, he boasted: \u201cI built the greatest economy in the history of the world. I built it.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Deborah Birx outlined the taskforce\u2019s new guidelines for state testing. Trump said the US has carried out 5.4m tests, more than double any other country. He did not mention how far it still lags behind per capita, nor how the prominent taskforce member Dr Anthony Fauci has warned that testing levels need to at least be doubled before lockdown restrictions can be relaxed.</p> <p>The president was told that at least one governor reports an increase in the improper use of disinfectants. He said: \u201cI can\u2019t imagine why. I can\u2019t imagine why.\u201d</p> <p>Asked if he accepts responsibility for the sharp rise, he answered bluntly: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Someone else wondered if Trump might try to change the date of the November election. \u201cNo, I would never change the date of the election,\u201d he said. \u201cNovember 3rd. It\u2019s a good number.\u201d</p> <p>There was a memorably pointed question: \u201cDoes a president deserve another term after more Americans die in six weeks than the entire Vietnam war?\u201d</p> <p>Trump, who was reportedly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/28/trump-coronavirus-politics-us-health-disaster\">warned about the coronavirus</a> by US intelligence agencies more than a dozen times in January and February, replied: \u201cWe\u2019ve lost a lot of people. But if you look at what original projections were \u2026 we\u2019ve made a lot of good decisions.\u201d</p> <p>Another reporter inquired about Kim\u2019s condition. \u201cI do have a very good idea but I can\u2019t talk about it now,\u201d Trump teased, gameshow-style. \u201cI just wish him well \u2026 I hope he\u2019s fine. I do know how he\u2019s doing, relatively speaking. We will see, you\u2019ll probably be hearing in the not too distant future.\u201d</p> <p>If only the victims of the coronavirus were afforded such presidential compassion.
