  "<p>Running for high office in the midst of a pandemic has forced candidates in South Korea to abandon tried and tested campaigning methods, as the country prepares to become the first to hold a national election since the start of the coronavirus outbreak.</p> <p>With a few exceptions, they have swapped handshakes for elbow bumps and delivered speeches from behind masks to small groups rather than hold mass rallies. Kissing babies is out of the question.</p> <p>In less tumultuous times, the 15 April elections would have been dominated by job creation, wages and North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons programme. But they have been overshadowed by president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/09/moon-jae-in-the-south-korean-pragmatist-who-would-be-presidentc\">Moon Jae-in</a>\u2019s response to the pandemic.</p> <p>Early indications are that the virus has failed to deter voters, with predictions of a record turnout by the time all the votes for the 300-seat national assembly have been cast on Wednesday evening. On Friday, more than 5 million people cast their ballots early \u2013 a record high since advance voting was introduced seven years ago.</p> <p>Like millions of his compatriots, Moon arrived at a polling station wearing a mask, and was not allowed to vote until he had passed a temperature test, washed his hands and put on plastic gloves.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1cdea811a7e5e3cfde8200ac6addbc8152106fb1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1cdea811a7e5e3cfde8200ac6addbc8152106fb1/0_109_2870_1722/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A candidate from the main opposition United Future party at a subway station in Seoul.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A candidate from the main opposition United Future party at a subway station in Seoul.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: YONHAP/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>South Korea has won praise from the World Health Organization for its success in bringing the outbreak under control, with more than a dozen world leaders seeking Seoul\u2019s advice on quarantine measures and requesting test kits. Nearly 60% of survey respondents approved of Moon\u2019s response to the pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cIn times of a national disaster or crisis, the ruling camp would usually be on the defensive. But the recent slowing of the outbreak appears to have turned the tide in their favour,\u201d said Yang Seung-ham, a professor of political science at Yonsei University in Seoul.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/south-korea\">South Korea</a> has brought daily known infections to about 50 or below, down from the late February peak of more than 900, through a combination of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/covid-19-south-koreans-keep-calm-and-carry-on-testing\">aggressive testing</a>, monitoring, social distancing and strict quarantine for overseas arrivals. It has had a <a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/south-korea/\">total of 10,537 cases</a>, with 217 deaths, as of the afternoon of Monday 13 April, according to the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. Well over 7,000 infected people have recovered from the illness.</p> <p>The country\u2019s response is expected to give Moon\u2019s Democratic party of Korea an unexpected boost, after a year of political scandals and criticism of his record on jobs and young people\u2019s living standards. His approval ratings reached a 16-month high last week, a poll by researchers at Realmeter showed, while his party\u2019s popularity was 15% higher than the conservative main opposition United Future party.</p> <p>\u201cWe were terrified several weeks ago, but thanks to the government\u2019s handling of the coronavirus, we think we will do much better than we had previously thought,\u201d a senior ruling party official said.</p> <p>The virus has transformed the mechanics of voting for millions of South Koreans amid concern that polling stations could trigger a second wave of infections, just as the country appears to be bringing the outbreak under control.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"95db811bdc4e6ccef78b7ac45992b01bb1e3874a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95db811bdc4e6ccef78b7ac45992b01bb1e3874a/0_0_4967_2982/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lee Nak-yon (centre) of the ruling Democratic party campaigns in Gumi, South Korea.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lee Nak-yon (centre) of the ruling Democratic party campaigns in Gumi, South Korea.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: YONHAP/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>More than 3,500 polling stations have been disinfected and all voters are required to use hand sanitiser and wear a mask and gloves.

  "<p>For the entirety of Ronald Reagan\u2019s first term, despite overwhelming evidence that Aids was a public health crisis, he brushed off the disease\u2019s severity, saying \u201cit would go away\u201d. By 1987, Aids had killed more than 29,000 Americans. In that same year, Don Francis, an official at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, testified before Congress that Reagan\u2019s administration caused \u201cuntold hardship, misery and expense to the American public\u201d by obstructing, resisting and interfering with policies and programmes designed to prevent the Aids epidemic in the US.</p> <p>Certain factors at play <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/06/1980s-aids-pandemic-coronavirus-gay-community-survive\">in the A</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/06/1980s-aids-pandemic-coronavirus-gay-community-survive\">ids epidemic</a> are not at play in our current pandemic: most obviously, Covid-19 is not associated with the gay community. Nonetheless, there are echoes of Reagan\u2019s response to the Aids epidemic. Last month, days after California had declared a state of emergency and Seattle schools had begun to close, Donald Trump asserted that Covid-19 would simply \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/28/trump-coronavirus-misleading-claims\">go away</a>\u201d. Shortly before that, he said that it would \u201c<a href=\"https://www.msnbc.com/deadline-white-house/watch/trump-coronavirus-will-disappear-one-day-like-a-miracle-79636549723\">disappear \u2026 like a miracle</a>\u201d. Trump was joined in his parade of denial by other far-right populist leaders, especially Brazil\u2019s president, Jair Bolsonaro. In March, he described Covid-19 as a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/brazils-jair-bolsonaro-says-coronavirus-crisis-is-a-media-trick\">little flu</a>\u201d that does not warrant \u201chysteria\u201d, and claimed that Brazil would be protected from the virus by its climate and youthful population.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We need leaders who allow public health experts, rather than their political self-interest, to guide policy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What motivates men like Trump and Bolsonaro to deny, falsify and dismiss evidence about public health crises?</p> <p>One salient feature stands out as common among these men: <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/22/us/toxic-masculinity.html\">toxic masculinity</a>. The concept has become popular, with Google searches for the term <a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;geo=US&amp;q=toxic%20masculinity\">skyrocketing</a> in January 2019 when the shaving company Gillette <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/01/15/gillette-takes-toxic-masculinity-new-ad-rebranding-metoo-era-inviting-backlash/\">released</a> a series of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/15/gillette-metoo-ad-on-toxic-masculinity-cuts-deep-with-mens-rights-activists\">advertisements</a> that challenged traditional expressions of masculinity, such as bullying, suppressing emotions and sexual harassment. Those advertisements set off a public debate about whether toxic masculinity is a helpful concept. Some took to Twitter and other media to complain that \u201c<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/masculinity-isnt-a-sickness-11547682809\">masculinity isn\u2019t a sickness</a>\u201d, while others, like the <a href=\"https://www.apa.org/monitor/2019/01/ce-corner\">American Psychological Association</a>, maintained that these traditional forms of masculinity harm not only men, but also those around them.</p> <p>The current pandemic throws into stark relief how useful the concept of toxic masculinity can be. Dr Roger Kirby, a men\u2019s health expert, <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/tre.709\">observes</a> that toxic forms of masculinity, which lead to \u201cdominant, aggressive, [and] risk-taking\u201d behaviour, cause men to see illness or other health problems as effeminate and weak, leading them to choose risk and discomfort over the \u201cemasculation\u201d of seeking medical treatment. As a result, men who pursue these forms of masculinity <a href=\"https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1016/j.jomh.2010.09.227\">display</a> \u201cthe strongest predictors of individual risk behaviour over the life course\u201d.</p> <p>Trump and Bolsonaro are clear examples of men who cling to toxic forms of masculinity. They lash out at anything that threatens their dominance, and rely on misogyny and violence to bolster their egos. They denigrate women and femininity in order to reinforce their fragile sense of their manhood, referring to women as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/16/brazil-lawmaker-rape-taunt\">slut[s]</a>\u201d, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/14/us/politics/trump-omarosa-dog.html\">dog[s]</a>\u201d and \u201c<a href=\"https://theweek.com/articles/655770/61-things-donald-trump-said-about-women\">piece[s] of ass</a>\u201d. Trump has boasted about his<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2016/03/03/politics/donald-trump-small-hands-marco-rubio/index.html\"> penis size</a> and<a href=\"https://deadline.com/2016/09/donald-trump-testosterone-level-applause-dr-oz-show-1201820359/\"> testosterone levels</a>, and Bolsonaro said that he would rather have a dead son than a gay one. Both frequently encourage or excuse violence, and rage at those who disagree or make fun of them. They are two peas in a pod. And in our current crisis, their toxic masculinity is a deathly threat. It plays out in the most literal sense: it risks physical harm to others and themselves.</p> <p>True to this prediction, Trump recently made headlines for initially refusing to take a test for Covid-19, obey physical distancing guidelines or wear a face mask, undermining his own health experts\u2019 recommendations. Bolsonaro, following suit, declared that his manly history \u201cas an athlete\u201d would protect him from the virus. And while it is tempting to laugh at the absurdity of Bolsonaro\u2019s claim, the sobering reality is that Trump and Bolsonaro\u2019s behaviour has an ever-rising body count.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/04/trump-coronavirus-science-analysis\">How science finally caught up with Trump's playbook \u2013 with millions of lives at stake</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Now that this lie is no longer sustainable, Trump and Bolsonaro have pivoted.

We need leaders who allow public health experts, rather than their political self-interest, to guide policy. We find ourselves in a time that calls for traditionally \u201cfeminine\u201d traits, such as empathy, solidarity and compassion.

Regressive policies and enforcement procedures are being scaled back in surprising numbers. While sectors under federal control \u2013 immigration policy, higher education, healthcare, election reform \u2013 have had few Covid-related changes, those controlled by city and state governments \u2013 criminal justice, housing, transportation, utilities \u2013 have had many.</p> <p>These changes were put in place to slow viral transmission and stabilize the economy, not to benefit social welfare. But what\u2019s interesting is how much overlap there is between them. Sector by sector, the pandemic has unintentionally sparked changes pushed by reformers for decades. What couldn\u2019t be done in years has now happened in a matter of weeks. Policy changes that before Covid were dismissed as unreasonable are now seen not only as reasonable but as necessary.</p> <p>It shows us how <a href=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/03/coronavirus-tsa-liquid-purell-paid-leave-rules.html\">absurd so many of our rules</a> were to begin with. But does it also show us how easy they\u2019ve been to change all along?</p> <p>Many of these changes still don\u2019t go far enough, come with caveats and fine print, are subject to absurd means-testing, or are only temporary. For those of us who believe that America needs serious change \u2013 and that this is the time to do it \u2013 what will it take to make many of these temporary changes permanent?

(Interestingly, America\u2019s free meal programs took off with the Black Panther party\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.eater.com/2016/2/16/11002842/free-breakfast-schools-black-panthers\">Free Breakfast for Children</a> program, which not only provided meals to students but also organized communities.)</p> <p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://theappeal.org/food-banks-surge-demand-coronavirus-covid-19/\">food banks are struggling to keep up with increased demand</a> \u2013 with cities such as Pittsburgh seeing a <a href=\"https://www.pittsburghfoodbank.org/2020/03/12/coronavirus/\">543% increase</a> \u2013 while shuttered restaurants and decreased demand for prepared food has led to food waste and <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/05/food-waste-coronavirus-pandemic-164557\">produce languishing in fields</a> against the usual backdrop of <a href=\"http://foe.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/CA-Food-and-Farm-stimulus-4-sign-on-letter-final.pdf\">inadequately protected and paid</a> workers.</p> <h2><strong>Direct cash transfers</strong></h2> <p>There have also been a number of cash transfer program proposals to provide financial relief (a <a href=\"https://www.jainfamilyinstitute.org/media/research/comparing-cash-transfer-legislation/\">breakdown of the proposals is here</a>), many of which would have been unheard of just a few weeks ago.</p> <p>Unfortunately these proposals took the form of the recently passed Cares Act, which is both insufficient and means-tested. Its passage, however, further demonstrates that the \u201c<a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/03/27/coronavirus-stimulus-package-spending/\">how will you pay for it</a>\u201d question is more about stopping progressive policies than genuine concern.</p> <h2><strong>People with foreign medical degrees can provide hospital care</strong></h2> <p>As hospitals lack beds and equipment and millions of Americans lose their jobs \u2013 and thus their health insurance \u2013 the inadequacies and cruelty of the American healthcare system (if not already obvious) is now undeniable. However, to keep up with increased need, outdated restrictions have been relaxed or lifted.</p> <p>In New York, <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/gmaniatis/status/1242852834707746816\">people with foreign medical degrees are now allowed to provide hospital care</a> \u2013 foreign-trained medical workers with advanced degrees <a href=\"https://commonwealthmagazine.org/health-care/foreign-trained-medical-professionals-waiting-to-help/\">are often relegated to low-wage, precarious work, such as driving for Uber</a>, because their degrees aren\u2019t recognized in the US. <a href=\"https://www.niskanencenter.org/states-are-temporarily-letting-doctors-chase-covid-19-across-state-lines-make-it-permanent/\">Restrictions on medical workers working across state lines</a> have been relaxed as well, while <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/490824-fda-loosens-restrictions-on-gay-men-donating-blood-amid-coronavirus\">archaic restrictions on blood donation from gay men have been eased</a> (though not entirely removed).</p> <h2>Price of insulin capped</h2> <p>As the world scrambles for Covid-19 treatments, the pharmaceutical industry has tried to secure exclusive rights on anything that looks promising. Gilead, notorious among other things for its $84,000 hepatitis C treatment, applied for and received <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/03/23/gilead-sciences-coronavirus-treatment-orphan-drug-status/\">orphan drug status</a> for its possible Covid-19 treatment remdesivir, a status normally reserved for drugs that treat rare illnesses (Gilead later<a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/03/25/gilead-sciences-coronavirus-drug/\"> walked back the claim</a>).</p> <p>At the same time, Eli Lilly <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/medical-devices-and-prescription-drug-policy/491685-drugmaker-caps-insulin-costs\">capped insulin costs to $35</a> in response to the pandemic. Normally, Eli Lilly\u2019s (and other manufacturers\u2019) insulin is so unaffordable that <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/09/01/641615877/insulins-high-cost-leads-to-lethal-rationing\">people die from rationing it to save money</a>.<br></p> <h2><strong>Remote working and paid sick leave</strong></h2> <p>To maintain productivity throughout the pandemic, many employers previously resistant to remote work arrangements are <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kwuchu/status/1240261206566461441\">suddenly open to them</a>. The expansion of remote work has been a long-denied <a href=\"https://www.bitchmedia.org/article/covid-19-is-proving-the-value-of-remote-work\">demand of disabled workers</a>, but only now are employers willing to consider it.</p> <p>Companies such as <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/11/21175538/amazon-coronavirus-paid-sick-leave-all-employees-relief-fund\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/10/walmart-apple-olive-garden-are-among-major-employers-updating-sick-leave-policies-coronavirus-cases-spread/\">Walmart</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/10/21173287/instacart-coronavirus-sick-pay-workers-in-store-shoppers-covid19\">Instacart</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/07/tech/uber-coronavirus-sick-leave/index.html\">Uber</a> have revised their sick leave policies to include employees who are typically denied such benefits. But in basically all cases, this sick leave is accessible only after testing positive for Covid-19 (a difficult requirement given the scarcity of tests) and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/03/30/worker-strike-instacart-amazon-whole-foods/\">in the absence of other necessities like protective equipment and hazard pay</a>.</p> <p>Companies such as <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/why-uber-still-call-drivers-contractors/\">Uber persistently resist classification of their drivers as proper employees</a>, and this very limited expansion of benefits is not really a substantial change away from that policy. At the very least, however, the recently passed <a href=\"https://www.epi.org/blog/despite-some-good-provisions-the-cares-act-has-glaring-flaws-and-falls-short-of-fully-protecting-workers-during-the-coronavirus-crisis/\">C</a><a href=\"https://www.epi.org/blog/despite-some-good-provisions-the-cares-act-has-glaring-flaws-and-falls-short-of-fully-protecting-workers-during-the-coronavirus-crisis/\">ares Act expands unemployment benefits to independent contractors</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Many academic books accessible for free</strong></h2> <p>Education has been fundamentally reshaped as schools move online, with educators scrambling to adjust teaching styles and materials to remote learning. Many university presses have <a href=\"https://www.publicbooks.org/public-books-database\">made their titles accessible for free</a> in response. But most notable is the admittedly tiny \u2013 but unprecedented \u2013 shift in the system of indebtedness that American higher education system is built on.</p> <h2><strong>Debt collection suspended</strong></h2> <p>New York has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NYGovCuomo/status/1239970795348094983\">suspended state debt collection</a>, including student and medical debt. At the federal level, initially a far more modest <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/487496-trump-waives-federal-student-loan-interest-in-response-to-coronavirus\">suspension of interest accrual</a> for federal loans was announced, but was <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/03/politics/student-loan-debt-suspension-economy/index.html\">updated to suspend payments and collections</a> as well.</p> <p>This still pales in comparison to measures taken by other countries, such as Venezuela, which announced <a href=\"https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/venezuela-prohibits-company-layoffs-and-suspends-credit-collections-over-coronavirus-2020\">country-wide six-month rent and credit payment freezes</a>. In the US, <a href=\"https://time.com/5814424/coronavirus-stimulus-student-loans/\">private lenders</a> are not required to take any such measures.</p> <p>Yet these moves seem to at least tacitly acknowledge the social harms of widespread debt burdens. This has not, however, stopped <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2020/03/27/debt-collection-industry-deems-itself-essential-to-financial-health-of-consumers-fights-covid-shutdown/\">the debt collection industry from trying to claim itself \u201cessential\u201d</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Free public transit</strong></h2> <p>City living is hugely influenced by access to reliable and affordable transit. Increased access to mobility has long been an important issue, but only now are we seeing changes.</p> <p>With pushback against fare hikes and ailing infrastructure already an issue before Covid, cities such as <a href=\"https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/transportation/article/texas-med-center-shuttle-coronavirus-houston-texas-15145695.php\">Houston</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2020/03/25/covid-19-metro-bus-fares-suspended-in-april/5077216002/\">Cincinnati</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/coronavirus/ny-coronavirus-mta-nyc-buses-free-outbreak-20200320-a24jq7ksrzcpvgq7e2dyzq2uqy-story.html\">New York</a> and <a href=\"https://www.santamonica.gov/coronavirus-resources#transportation\">Santa Monica</a> have suspended bus fares, and some bike-share services are offering free rides, such as in <a href=\"https://mogodetroit.org/blog/free-monthly-pass/\">Detroit</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ExploreMemphis/status/1241130765104054275\">Memphis</a> and <a href=\"http://ridekcbike.com/2020/03/18/freerides/\">Kansas City</a>.

  "<p>Iran\u2019s president has been accused of leaving the country exposed to a second coronavirus outbreak after he relaxed social distancing rules in the face of concerns that as many as 7 million Iranians had been left jobless or suffering wage cuts because of the restrictions imposed by the government over the last month.</p> <p>Hassan Rouhani has urged millions of low-risk businesses to reopen and lifted travel restrictions within provinces. Most businesses in Tehran are not due to reopen formally until 18 April, but travel has already intensified, leading to a build-up of traffic.</p> <p>Surveys cited by the government showed that a third of people are experiencing financial problems.</p> <p>Ali Rabiei, Rouhani\u2019s spokesman, told the Isna news agency that the Covid-19 crisis had affected 3.3 million official employees through dismissal, suspension or reduction of wages, with a further 4 million self-employed also feeling its impact. </p> <p>In common with most world leaders, Rouhani is wrestling with the competing needs of collapsing living standards and public health. Iranian officials describe it as a dual policy of \u201csaving lives and providing bread\u201d.</p> <p>He is also operating against a backdrop of US economic sanctions and public scepticism about official government statistics on the spread of coronavirus. Schools, religious services, mass gatherings and many shops remain closed and Rouhani has said if the position did not improve he expected the existing closures to remain in place through Ramadan.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0d3fcdc8c88408292ffc9c8fc9af7f2e4eb49cd2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0d3fcdc8c88408292ffc9c8fc9af7f2e4eb49cd2/0_0_2500_1666/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hassan Rouhani at a meeting in Tehran of a national committee tackling the coronavirus outbreak in Iran.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hassan Rouhani at a meeting in Tehran of a national committee tackling the coronavirus outbreak in Iran.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He urged people to use private cars after there were crowded buses on the first day of the relaxed rules on Saturday.

In an unprecedented step, union leaders have refused to back a proposed 21% increase in the minimum wage \u2013 well below the current 40% inflation rate.</p> <p>Ministers are offering individual loans to those suffering most, but even that help is being criticised, as the monthly repayment instalments will attract 12% interest.</p> <p>Newspapers have also been dealt a heavy blow, with the government proposing to ban all but online newspapers temporarily on the basis paper might transmit infection. The plan, subsequently withdrawn, led to warnings of mass permanent newspaper closures. Redundancies, including in prestigious reformist newspapers such as Etemad, have gone ahead.</p> <p>Tragedies, including the death of three generations of men in one family, are being publicised in a bid to underline the seriousness of the crisis. A mother and son were reported to have committed suicide after the father died.</p> <p>There are also growing reports of domestic violence, with one Tehran counselling service saying it had taken 4,000 calls in the last few days. Children stuck at home without education do not have the money to afford the internet required to download lessons.</p> <p>The health ministry\u2019s latest statistics on Sunday showed a continued de-escalation of coronavirus cases, with 4,474 now dead and 71,686 infected.

years sub-Saharan Africa is about to go into recession, according to World Bank estimates.</p> <p>Sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s two biggest economies, South Africa and Nigeria are heading for deep recessions, it said, as demand drops from developed nations for raw materials such as oil and precious metals.</p> <p>The same goes for Angola, Africa\u2019s second biggest oil exporter.</p> <p>Oil prices have fallen to between $20 and $30 a barrel, nearing the cost of production in Nigeria.</p> <p>Following 2.4% growth last year, the estimate for sub-Saharan Africa 2020 is between -2.1 and -5.1 % as the economy contracts.</p> <p>This is in part a knock-on effect from the economic hits being taken by Africa\u2019s main trading partners: China, the EU and the United States.</p> <p>Add to that the slump in the key markets of raw materials and tourism as well as the effect of measures to confine populations at home and you have the perfect economic storm for the continent.</p> <p>The African Development Bank remains less pessimistic but still sees a fall into recession of between -0.7 and -2.8 %.</p> <p>The African Union estimates that around 20m jobs, in formal and informal sectors, are under threat.<br></p> <p>The United Nations puts the figure much higher, at up to 50m.</p> <p>High unemployment and economic slowdown are also hitting African workers abroad, and therefore their money transfers back home, which are often a vital part of the economy.</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e92b7668f08db3109f20f8a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p

British aid minister Anne-Marie Trevelyan said assisting the poorest nations now would help prevent the virus returning to the United Kingdom. </p> <p>Britain has reported almost 10,000 deaths from the coronavirus so far, the fifth highest national number globally. </p> <p>\u201cWhile our brilliant doctors and nurses fight coronavirus at home, we\u2019re deploying British expertise and funding
