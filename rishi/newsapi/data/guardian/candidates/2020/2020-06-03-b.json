The president said he would use the law if local authorities failed&nbsp;\u201cto defend the life and property of their residents\u201d.</p> <p>Esper categorically opposed using the act on Wednesday.</p> <p>\u201cI say this not only as secretary of defence, but also as a former soldier, and a former member of the national guard, the option to use active-duty forces in a law enforcement role should only be used as a matter of last resort, and only in the most urgent and dire of situations,\u201d the defence secretary said. \u201cWe are not in one of those situations now. I do not support invoking the Insurrection Act.\u201d</p> <p>Esper has been supportive of Trump and has avoided contradicting him until now.&nbsp;But there is reported to be mounting unease about senior officers about the politicisation of the armed forces, and concern over Esper\u2019s own actions.</p> <p>\u201cEsper has directly challenged Trump,\u201d Thomas Wright, director of the centre on the United States and Europe on the Brookings Institution, said on Twitter. \u201cTrump hates being boxed in. If he fires Esper, it could set in motion a crisis that may lead to a wider revolt within the GOP.\u201d</p> <p>Esper was due in the White House to meet Trump straight after his Wednesday morning press briefing. It was not clear if Trump had ordered him to reverse his order on troops deployments around Washington.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s spokeswoman, Kayleigh McEnany, told reporters: \u201cAs of right now, Secretary Esper is still Secretary Esper.\u201d</p> <p>She added that the press would hear if Trump lost confidence in him and noted: \u201cThe president has the sole authority to invoke the Insurrection Act.\u201d </p> <p>There has been widespread outrage \u2013 including from former officers \u2013 over the participation of Esper and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff who were present at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/02/trump-washington-walk-to-the-church-photo-op\">a photo</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/02/trump-washington-walk-to-the-church-photo-op\"> op outside a church near the White House</a> on Monday after the surrounding area had been cleared with gas canisters, mounted police and baton charges.</p> <p>Esper\u2019s participation provoked the resignation of a&nbsp;member of the defense science board, James Miller, who <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/06/02/secretary-esper-you-violated-your-oath-aiding-trumps-photo-op-thats-why-im-resigning/?arc404=true\">alleged</a> the defence secretary had \u201cvisibly supported\u201d the use of force.</p> <p>Esper said he was not aware of the measures that had been taken to drive protesters out.&nbsp;He said he was under the impression that he and Milley would inspect damage in Lafayette Park, just in front of the White House and in St John\u2019s Episcopal church, where there had been a fire in the basement.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/02/trump-washington-walk-to-the-church-photo-op\">A photo op as protests swirled: how Trump came to walk to the church</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI was not aware a photo op was happening,\u201d Esper said. \u201cOf course, the president drags a large press pool along with him. And look, I do everything I can to try to stay apolitical and try and stay out of situations that may appear political and sometimes I\u2019m successful with doing that, and sometimes I\u2019m not as successful, but my aim is to keep the department out of politics, to stay apolitical.\u201d</p> <p>But Esper defended his call to state governors on Monday \u201cto dominate the battlespace\u201d in responding to protests over the police killing of George Floyd.</p> <p>\u201cThe sooner that you mass and dominate the battlespace, the quicker this dissipates, and we can get back to the right normal,\u201d Esper said on the call with Trump and the governors.</p> <p>Speaking on Wednesday he said battlespace was \u201cpart of our military lexicon\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s what we routinely use to describe a bounded area of operations. It\u2019s not a phrase focused on people, and certainly not on our fellow Americans,\u201d Esper said.</p> <p>But he added: \u201cIn retrospect I would use different wording, so as not to distract from the more important matters at hand.\u201d</p> <p>Esper also said he had asked the army secretary, Ryan McCarthy, to launch an inquiry into a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2020/06/02/helicopter-protest-dc/\">national </a><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2020/06/02/helicopter-protest-dc/\">guard medevac helicopter</a> which was filmed hovering low over protesters in Washington, in an apparent effort to disperse them.</p> <p>Esper refused to be drawn in making an initial assessment but he did offer an alternative to the view that the helicopter was used for intimidation.</p> <p>\u201cI got a report back that they were asked by law enforcement to look at a checkpoint, a national guard checkpoint, to see if there were protesters around. So there\u2019s conflicting reports.\u201d</p> <p>He did not explain why a helicopter would be needed to spot protesters when the streets were full of law enforcement officers from various agencies, nor why a helicopter would have to hover so low to confirm the presence of protesters on the street.</p>",

  "<p>The president of one of the UK\u2019s biggest motoring organisations has called on the government to introduce a \u201croad miles\u201d pricing system for drivers.</p> <p>Edmund King called for \u201cmore radical thinking\u201d from metropolitan and city leaders, saying the changes forced on the public by the crisis offered a huge opportunity to change the UK\u2019s transport systems and behaviours and encourage more people to walk and cycle.</p> <p>Speaking at a virtual conference organised by the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, King said a car miles \u2013 or road miles \u2013 system could allow drivers to have the first 3,000 miles free, after which they would have to pay per journey. Those in rural areas would get an extra 1,000 miles free.</p> <p>\u201cIt makes you think about the trip and if you have a cleaner greener vehicle you can pay less \u2026 We need some radical thinking and perhaps now the time is right for the Treasury and others to address these bigger issues that politically they have been quite wary of addressing before.\u201d</p> <p>King highlighted evidence from the AA\u2019s own research that showed its members&nbsp;were ready to change their behaviour.</p> <p>\u201cTransport patterns won\u2019t be the same in life after lockdown, according to drivers,\u201d he said. \u201cHalf say they will walk more; four in 10 vow to drive less; a quarter will work from home more and one fifth will cycle more.\u201d</p> <p>The idea of a&nbsp;per-mile charging scheme based on the environmental impact of vehicle journeys has gained traction in recent years. In 2017 it was reported that London mayor Sadiq Khan was considering introducing a per-mile charging scheme in the capital&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/apr/29/report-backs-per-mile-road-charging-scheme-for-london\">and last year&nbsp;the Centre for London&nbsp;thinktank</a> \u2013 backed by politicians and business groups \u2013 said it would be a more sophisticated approach to road charging and better reflect the true impact of each individual journey than London\u2019s current ultra low emissions zone.&nbsp;</p> <p>King\u2019s call follows<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/18/a-new-normal-how-coronavirus-will-transform-transport-in-britains-cities\"> measures</a>&nbsp;being rolled out in cities around the world to increase support and infrastructure for walking and cycling as clean alternatives to packed public transport \u2013 which is not compatible with the social distancing required by the coronavirus crisis.</p> <p>King said people\u2019s experience of cleaner air, quieter roads \u2013 and particularly mass home-working \u2013 had created an opportunity that should not be missed.</p> <p>\u201cI am optimistic that this lockdown is beginning to change the attitudes of drivers \u2026 If local authorities can put in well planned infrastructure to walk and to cycle \u2013 and public transport when that returns \u2013 I do feel that can have a credible difference.</p> <p>He added: \u201cThe time is right at the moment because people are out there and they themselves had seen the benefits of walking and cycling and running \u2026 it is a real opportunity.\u201d</p>",

until Trump coasts down Pennsylvania Avenue on top of a tank in a Mao suit and a bunch of a Gaddafi scarves?\u201d</p> <h2>Stephen Colbert</h2> <p>On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert also addressed Trump\u2019s threat to send in the military against US protesters. \u201cSo, in response to protests about police brutality, you\u2019re threatening to throw in the army to crush them,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s like forgetting your child\u2019s birthday, and apologizing by sending in the army to crush them.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\"

peaceful protesters for Trump\u2019s Bible photo op with teargas and flash bombs. \u201cNot only is that a horrific abuse of the office of the presidency and our military, the teargas is completely unnecessary \u2013 when people see Trump walking toward them on the street, they naturally cry and vomit,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cHere\u2019s how bald this display of authoritarianism is: while he\u2019s giving his speech in the Rose Garden, you can actually hear the military flash grenades exploding among the protesters in the background,\u201d he continued, playing a clip of Trump saying \u201cwhere there is no law, there is no opportunity\u201d as a flash grenade pops in the background. \u201cAnd where there is law, opportunity knocks \u2026 you in the head with a billy club, or just shoots you in the nuts with a rubber bullet,\u201d Colbert added, imitating the president.</p> <h2>Jimmy Kimmel</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\"

his personal reckoning over the concept of white privilege. \u201cI know a lot of white people bristle when they hear the word \u2018privilege\u2019, as in white privilege, because there are millions of white people who didn\u2019t grow up with money or a good education or a solid family background, or maybe even a family at all,\u201d he said. \u201cSo when they hear the word privilege, they go, \u2018what privilege?\u2019\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Kimmel admitted that like many white people, he felt defensive when he first heard the term: \u201cI rejected it, because I didn\u2019t understand what white privilege meant,\u201d thinking it meant people with a \u201csilver spoon\u201d like Trump, and not his upbringing.</p> <p>But \u201cpeople who are white, we don\u2019t have to deal with negative assumptions being made about us based on the color of our skin \u2026 whereas black people experience that every day,\u201d he said. \u201cImagine how frustrating it must be to have to prove yourself to be something other than what people assume you probably are every day, sometimes multiple times every day.</p> <p>\u201cAnd now imagine what it must be like to be brutalized and killed and scared that those things might happen. What happened to George Floyd was on video \u2013 how often does this happen without a camera recording the whole thing?</p> <p>\u201cSo if you\u2019re wondering why people are angry and why they can\u2019t just march nicely in the street holding up the signs in a single-file line, maybe that\u2019s why,\u201d he concluded, adding: \u201cWhite privilege doesn\u2019t mean your life hasn\u2019t been hard, it just means the color of your skin isn\u2019t one of the things that makes it harder.\u201d</p>",

The black community and women fought to have power in a country built on racism, and where violence against women and members of the LGBTQ+ community has reached alarming levels. Assassinated in March 2018, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/mar/14/marielle-franco-murder-brazil\">Mariele Franco</a> embodied this hard-won power: the leftwing city councillor was female, black, lesbian and from a favela.</p> <p>No one has better leveraged hatred, fear and frustration than Bolsonaro.&nbsp;He has done so especially among sections of the white middle-class, who have suffered the erosion of their buying power and watched as the black community refused to return to its historical subaltern position.

  "<p>Four men have won the sprint triple of 100m, 200m and 4x100m at the Olympics and, chances are, you know three of them: Jesse Owens, Carl Lewis and Usain Bolt. Then there is Bobby Joe Morrow, who died last weekend at the age of 84. When Morrow won all three at the Melbourne Games in 1956 he was, briefly, as famous as any of the others. He was a guest on the Ed Sullivan show, same episode as Marcel Marceau, and Arthur Godfrey and His Friends, <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=x0EEAAAAMBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\" title=\"\">he made the cover of Life magazine</a> and was even named by the US Chamber of Commerce as one of nine Great Living Americans, right alongside Cecil B DeMille and Norman Rockwell.</p> <p>Sports Illustrated made him <a href=\"https://vault.si.com/vault/1957/01/07/sportsman-of-1956\" title=\"\">its sportsman of 1956</a>, the same year Floyd Patterson became the youngest heavyweight champion in history and Mickey Mantle won the triple crown for the Yankees. Morrow was 21 years old, tall, handsome, and \u201cthe Beau Ideal of the US Olympic team\u201d. He grew up on a farm in San Benito, way down in south-east Texas, his father was an elder in the Church of Christ, and the family were \u201cprosperous, unostentatious, and deeply religious\u201d. The way they told it, his only vice was ice cream. It made him something \u201ca little larger than a fine sprinter\u201d. He was the \u201csort of American which most of the world has had too little opportunity to know\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/29/my-favourite-game-britain-upset-usa-gold-tokyo-91\">My favourite game: Britain upset the USA with 4x400m gold at Tokyo '91 | Stuart Goodwin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Almost 50 years later, Sports Illustrated travelled back to San Benito to profile Morrow again.

Reading all this back now, alongside the few scant paragraphs that have been published in the papers since his death, it feels like Bobby Morrow\u2019s wasn\u2019t a story about the rewards of fame but the costs. But then he would likely scoff at that, just as he seemed to at almost everything else that was written about him.</p> <p>He could always run. In his last year of high school he covered 100 yards in 9.6sec, hand-timed. He was something to see, in those days. \u201cHe was the most beautiful runner anyone ever saw,\u201d said his first wife, Jo Ann Richey. \u201cSo relaxed, so graceful, like when he was chasing rabbits back on the farm.\u201d Morrow\u2019s coach at Abilene Christian University reckoned he \u201ccould run a 220 with a root beer float on his head and never spill a drop\u201d. He was, his friend William Martin wrote in Texas Monthly, <a href=\"https://www.texasmonthly.com/articles/the-fastest-nice-christian-boy-in-the-world/\" title=\"\">\u201cas beautiful as a high speed human could be\u201d</a>. In Melbourne he became the first man since Owens to win three gold medals in the sprints, set an Olympic record in the 200m and anchored the 4x100m team to a world record.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d1996fa0010d6e3d45caaef9aeaa3fff213add1b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1996fa0010d6e3d45caaef9aeaa3fff213add1b/22_343_2915_1750/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thane Baker (centre) hands the baton to Bobby Joe Morrow in the first heat of the 4x100 in Melbourne.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thane Baker (centre) hands the baton to Bobby Joe Morrow in the first heat of the 4x100 in Melbourne.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: SF/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Morrow intended to defend his Olympic titles at Rome in 1960, when he was 25. But he strained a muscle before the trials and, running injured, finished last in his 100m heat. Still, the head coach invited him along to the team\u2019s training camp and told him that if his leg got better they would find a space for him on the relay team. It did, but they didn\u2019t. The day before the team were due to fly to Rome they said they still hadn\u2019t made a decision, and that he should come along to the airport the next morning. When he did, they finally told him he wasn\u2019t going. Richey said the humiliation he felt was a cause of their divorce years later.</p> <p>They had twins, and Morrow, who had quit a bank job so he could train full-time, found he was struggling to support them. He had railed against the Amateur Athletics Union\u2019s strict rules limiting earnings, and the hypocrisy of the men who enforced them, like the International Olympic Committee president Avery Brundage. He saw how the officials \u2013 \u201ca bunch of guys whose job was to hand out soap and towels, because they had to find something for them to do\u201d \u2013 enjoyed first-class flights and accommodation while the athletes were living on $15 per diem. </p> <p>Morrow met the US attorney general Robert Kennedy to petition him about it, and then testified at a senate hearing on the subject. Nothing changed, except that he got even angrier about the way he had been treated.</p> <p>So Morrow started looking for other ways to make money. A conman named Max Nunn roped him into a snake oil business selling a \u201cmineral potion\u201d called Stim-o-Stam. \u201cAll the friends I sold stock to lost their money,\u201d he told William Martin, \u201cpeople that didn\u2019t really have money, that had to go out and borrow it to put it in.\u201d He fell in with the infamous Church of Christ fraudster Billie Sol Estes, too. Then he was caught up in a third scandal when he was recruited by a phoney organisation called the Higher Education Crusade.</p> <p>\u201cAgain, somebody was using my name to do their dirty work,\u201d he told Martin. \u201cI didn\u2019t have any control over it but, of course, my name was connected with the company as representing them. I felt lousy, really. I seemed to be always getting involved with crooks.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c422d9339da82c508937834629fcfd4ef2e714d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c422d9339da82c508937834629fcfd4ef2e714d5/37_137_1912_1148/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bobby Joe Morrow (left) is handed an Olympic portrait of himself during the 2006 inauguration of the stadium that bears his name in San Benito, Texas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bobby Joe Morrow (left) is handed an Olympic portrait of himself during the 2006 inauguration of the stadium that bears his name in San Benito, Texas.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lynn Hermosa/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So he started to shun publicity, to skip the reunions, and forgo the public appearances. By the time he spoke to Martin, Morrow had remarried, and was living back on his family farm. Still, he said he was sorry he had ever won the medals, that he would have been happier if he\u2019d been \u201cjust another man in the street\u201d. He was inducted into the National Track &amp; Field hall of fame in 1989, and San Benito high school named its football stadium after him in 2006.</p> <p>You like to think that, in the end, he found a measure of happiness in his obscurity \u2013 but perhaps that, too, is just a bit of wishful thinking, another of the stories we tell ourselves about our heroes.</p>",

In some cases, the rate of black men killed by police rivals that posed by serious infectious disease.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cProtests are life-saving for black people in this country,\u201d said Dr Rhea Boyd, pediatrician and masters of public health in minority health policy. \u201cEven though being in the streets increases your risk,\u201d of Covid-19 infection, \u201cwe all know that risk exists anyway.\u201d&nbsp;</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/RheaBoydMD/status/1267116372078682113\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">1 in 1000 Black men and boys will be killed by police in their lifetime. <br><br>1 in 1000 is also the mortality rate of measles, a risk deemed so deadly, it has near constant public health surveillance and prevention.<br><br>That we don't treat police violence the same is a form of racism.</p>\u2014 Rhea Boyd, MD (@RheaBoydMD) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RheaBoydMD/status/1267116372078682113?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 31, 2020</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>While Covid-19 has killed more than 100,000 Americas in just a few months, past studies have found <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2019-08-15/police-shootings-are-a-leading-cause-of-death-for-black-men\">one in 1,000 black men in American</a> are expected to die by police violence in their lifetimes. That is roughly equal to the rate which <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/measles/symptoms/complications.html\">measles kills children</a>.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The coronavirus represents an especially contagious and deadly disease.</p> \n<p>Compared with <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe2009758\">past coronavirus outbreaks</a>, Covid-19 is spread much more easily among people who show no symptoms, known as asymptomatic carriers. The virus is especially contagious, because of how it is shed from the upper respiratory tract \u2013 or the part of the body used to chant, cry and cough.&nbsp;Although death rates vary across countries, they <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality\">remain high</a>.</p> \n<p>Protesters or police shouting at the top of their lungs could spread viral droplets for which masks are a weak barrier. Holding hands could also spread contagion. Corralling protesters together makes social distancing impossible. And thousands of people circulating together make contact tracing all but impossible.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Protests have also shut down testing sites in some cities and states, including in Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Jacksonville, Florida, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-pulse/2020/06/02/covid-19-testing-sites-shutter-amid-protests-788135\">Politico reported</a>.</p> \n<p>At the same time, police tactics threaten to accelerate the spread of Covid-19. The use of teargas and pepper sprays are a public health nightmare. Both cause incessant coughing. Oil-based pepper sprays cause tears, mucus and saliva to pour from the eyes, nose and mouth.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Teargas and pepper spray \u201cwould be the last agent I would use during this time period, for that reason,\u201d said Markel. \u201cYou amplify the possibility of spread.\u201d&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Quickly jailing protesters also holds unknown infection control risks, given the heavy presence of the virus in jails and prisons.</p> \n<p>Nina Fefferman is a professor at the University of Tennessee Knoxville, and a mathematical epidemiologist. At the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, her work focused on projecting the impact of mass incarceration on the spread of the virus. Because communities of color are disproportionately jailed, they were also most likely to be affected by outbreaks in jails and prisons.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Protesters sent to jail for short periods in the current unrest are \u201ctemporarily increasing the number and also social diversity caught up in the criminal justice system, introducing them into a jail population, and then releasing them,\u201d said Fefferman. \u201cNone of it is good \u2013 but all of it is unusual.\u201d&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Four days of protest in Las Vegas provides an example of how this plays out on-the-ground. A local court ordinance asked police to release people charged with misdemeanors, rather than bring them into jail, to slow the spread of Covid-19. Instead, police working protests in Las Vegas have arrested at least 338 people over the course of the demonstrations, and have used teargas and pepper balls to disperse crowds.</p> \n<p>Fefferman developed a model used by the <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/news/smart-justice/new-model-shows-reducing-jail-population-will-lower-covid-19-death-toll-for-all-of-us/\">American Civil Liberties Union</a> that found reducing mass incarceration could save 100,000 lives \u2013 including 76,000 lives among the broader community \u2013 because it would reduce the rate of infected corrections officers and accused who return to the community after exposure to the coronavirus.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>At the same time, Covid-19 has already taken a devastating and disproportionate toll on black Americans, because of a laundry list of state policies. Black Americans are less likely to have <a href=\"https://www.nationalpartnership.org/our-work/resources/economic-justice/paid-sick-days/african-american-workers-need-paid-sick-days.pdf\">paid sick leave</a>, less likely to live in states with <a href=\"https://www.medicaid.gov/about-us/program-history/medicaid-50th-anniversary/entry/47671\">public health insurance safety nets</a> and<strong> </strong>are overrepresented among <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/business/economy/black-workers-inequality-economic-risks.html\">essential workers</a>,&nbsp;</p> \n<p>\u201cAfrican Americans already suffer from chronic under-treated and untreated illness within our healthcare system, that denies them care at every level,\u201d Boyd said. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"69591434-e851-4bb8-aa30-0a6f773b6f97\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sjhF1GI9n8A?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Researchers from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have argued, as recently as 2017, that anti-discrimination laws in employment, housing, education and healthcare result in enormous gains in life expectancy for Americans of color \u2013 when they are enforced.&nbsp;That provides powerful reasons to keep protesting for police reform, even in the face of a pandemic.</p> \n<p>Demonstrations that led to civil rights in the American south provide one salient example of the health benefits of fighting for minority rights. In the 1960s, the American south segregated hospitals. However, they were forced to integrate after a court ruled white segregationists could not deny treatment to black Americans.</p> \n<p>Researchers found over six years from the time of the change, that the rate of black infants dying from pneumonia and diarrhea <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5730086/\">dropped by 40%</a> while the rate of infant death among whites remained the same. Researchers now estimate between 1965 and 2002, the change saved 38,600 black lives.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Protests of the past, which \u201ccame on the backs of black bodies that were murdered in the streets\u201d, have secured protections Boyd said, \u201cnot just for black people \u2013 for women,&nbsp;for LGBTQ folks, for everybody in this country who ever needed a civil liberty\u201d.</p>",
  "<p>The early months of Donald Trump\u2019s administration saw its approach to science routinely compared to George W Bush\u2019s \u2013 both governments were highly sympathetic to large corporations, distrustful of anything to do with the climate crisis and enthused at the idea of delegating oversight to the states.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s version may have been more abrasive and bungling but it at least seemed a familiar extension of the last Republican administration.</p> <p>More recently, however, scientists have been struck by Trump\u2019s embrace of fringe beliefs and extreme, unsupported theories. Suddenly, it is not the profit-driven lobbyists and lawyers that are the worry, it is the quacks, cranks and conspiracy theorists.</p> <p>\u201cThey have exceeded my imagination with their scientific denial,\u201d said Gretchen Goldman, a research director at Union of Concerned Scientists. \u201cPrevious administrations at least gave the appearance of wanting scientific evidence and qualified people in positions of power. This administration clearly doesn\u2019t care, which changes the game.\u201d</p> <p>Trump himself has a long history of defying mainstream scientific findings on the existence of climate change and the efficacy of vaccines, but his actions during the coronavirus pandemic have startled even his most vocal critics.</p> <p>The president falsely claimed Covid-19 would evaporate in the April sunshine, expressed bewilderment that a vaccine wasn\u2019t imminent and pondered the merits of injecting disinfectant as a treatment. Trump has also repeatedly touted the benefits of hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug he says he himself has taken as a precaution despite evidence it can cause heart problems in some patients. The World Health Organization recently <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/amp/health-52799120\">halted</a> trials to see if the drug could treat Covid-19, citing safety fears.</p> <p>From its inception, the Trump administration has handed leadership of federal agencies to figures who have represented polluting industries. Andrew Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist, heads the Environmental Protection Agency, while David Bernhardt, another former energy lobbyist, is in charge of America\u2019s public lands as secretary of the interior.</p> <p>The deregulatory zeal of these agencies, often in the face of scientific advice, has seen droves of scientists leave the government. In a January estimate, 20% of high-level scientific positions within the government are <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/science-ranks-grow-thin-in-trump-administration/2020/01/23/5d22b522-3172-11ea-a053-dc6d944ba776_story.html\">vacant</a>, with long-term officials complaining of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/17/whistleblowers-scientists-climate-crisis-trump-administration\">being sidelined or silenced</a>.</p> <p>But the administration has also increasingly shown willingness to ally itself with groups far more fringe than the standard class of lobbyist that inhabits Washington DC.</p> <p>The administration defended Trump\u2019s use of hydroxychloroquine by pointing to supportive statements from the Association of Physicians and Surgeons, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/24/hydroxychloroquine-trump-us-doctors-coronavirus\">an outlier group</a> that has questioned whether HIV causes Aids (it does), argued abortion causes breast cancer (it does not) and even alleged former president Barack Obama used hypnosis techniques to trick voters, especially Jewish people, into supporting him (there is no evidence of this).</p> <p>In April, Trump unveiled advice from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that Americans should wear face masks to curb the spread of Covid-19, but has since echoed fringe rightwing views that masks are pointless or somehow unmanly. The president said on Tuesday it was \u201cvery unusual\u201d that Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, was seen wearing a mask, calling its use \u201cpolitically correct\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe elevation of fringe views is even more vivid with coronavirus, the impacts are more evident,\u201d said Goldman.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Trump administration has aligned itself with an anti-abortion lobbying group called the Center for Family and Human Rights, helping spread its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/may/16/cfam-rightwing-white-house-anti-abortion-un\">message to the UN</a>, while Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/27/paula-white-donald-trump-pastor-evangelicals\">own spiritual advis</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/mar/27/paula-white-donald-trump-pastor-evangelicals\">er Paula White</a> has said she hopes abortion laws are overturned, declaring on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/27/satanic-pregnancies-trump-spiritual-adviser-paula-white-outlandish-acts\">video</a> that emerged in January: \u201cWe command any satanic pregnancies to miscarry right now!\u201d</p> <p>The pandemic has obscured a determined push by the Trump administration to further roll back regulations designed to prevent pollution and protect public health, with some of these efforts jarring uncomfortably with the federal government\u2019s own analysis.</p> <p>For example, the administration is scaling back fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks, a process that has provoked a <a href=\"https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/attachments/press-docs/5.27.20%20Petition%20for%20Review.pdf\">lawsuit</a> from 23 aggrieved states and, according to <a href=\"https://www.edf.org/sites/default/files/Cars_Final_Rollback_Factsheet.pdf\">a study of the EPA\u2019s own figures</a>, will cause an extra 18,500 deaths over the next three decades from air pollution, as well as $240bn more in extra fuel costs for Americans.</p> <p>\u201cThis administration is antithetical to science, there is an ideological mandate to roll back regulations. Facts and logic doesn\u2019t matter, even the law doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d said Chris Frey, a a professor of environmental engineering at NC State University.</p> <p>Frey was part of an EPA clean air advisory panel that was dismantled as part of a revamp that has seen agency panels filled with industry-aligned and fringe characters \u2013 including an official who <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/02/14/583972957/top-epa-science-adviser-has-history-of-questioning-pollution-research\">has argued air pollution is good for public health</a> \u2013 and the process of considering science rerouted to bypass a large body of research that links pollution to harm such as asthma and heart disease.</p> <p>\u201cIt will take years to undo the damage. This administration is honestly a threat to public health,\u201d Frey said. \u201cThe past three years have hurt the US scientific community in a lot of ways. If this continues for another three years, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s robust enough to take it.\u201d</p> <p>US politics\u2019 problematic relationship with science doesn\u2019t just hinge upon one administration, however. Until the election of a handful of people with scientific backgrounds in the 2018 midterms, Bill Foster was the only member of Congress with a scientific PhD. Foster has admitted the experience often felt lonely and frustrating.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve achieved a lot with science but I\u2019m embedded in a culture that doesn\u2019t value science,\u201d said Foster, an Illinois Democrat. \u201cThe heroes we are looking for are the people who have spent their careers in science.\u201d</p> <p>Foster added that Trump\u2019s reaction to mask wearing has cost lives.</p> <p>\u201cIf he had said masks are very useful and then apologized for the fact the stockpile of masks was so low, many tens of thousands of Americans would be alive today,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is the tragedy that bothers me more than anything.\u201d</p>",

One of the helicopters had Red Cross markings and the show of force is being investigated by the national guard, according to the Washington Post. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-03T03:30:37.346Z\">at 4.30am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed703518f08f5e373013753\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-03T02:04:20.190Z\">3.04am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Thousands of protesters have rallied peacefully outside of the White House</strong> on Tuesday evening, chanting \u201ckeep the peace\u201d as night grew dark. </p> \n  <p>The crowd grew thinner after 8pm, an hour after the capital\u2019s curfew had set in, but several hundred remained outside of the fence. </p> \n  <p>When one protester climbed a lamp post and removed a street sign he was roundly booed by others. \u201cIt\u2019s not what we\u2019re about,\u201d George \u201cTJ\u201d Pierce, one of the protesters in the park, told the Associated Press.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ab535496fb54b2db3763d6efa0d0fbb221c401d9\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab535496fb54b2db3763d6efa0d0fbb221c401d9/0_110_3320_1993/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstrators gather in front of a fence surrounding Lafayette Park outside the White House on Tuesday evening\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstrators gather in front of a fence surrounding Lafayette Park outside the White House on Tuesday evening.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"24a451d17b688d05c6f6926bad79bef907171e6e\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24a451d17b688d05c6f6926bad79bef907171e6e/0_0_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstrators near Lafayette park on Tuesday evening\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstrators near Lafayette park on Tuesday evening.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Olivier Douliery/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fec67f5d1bd1c4954a288b69cda504f04bc76eda\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fec67f5d1bd1c4954a288b69cda504f04bc76eda/0_113_3396_2038/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hundreds of demonstrators marching toward Lafayette Park and the White House\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hundreds of demonstrators marching toward Lafayette Park and the White House.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Drew Angerer/Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-03T02:32:53.966Z\">at 3.32am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed6ff4d8f084df971c8ea0e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/julianborger\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-03T01:53:24.973Z\">2.53am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Analysis: Trump has normalised mayhem and the US is paying the price</strong></p> \n  <p>The sheer tumult of the Trump era, the unceasing torrent of events that were unthinkable even hours before, has left a nation constantly off balance, unable to find its bearing and grasp how far it has traveled.</p> \n  <p>The developments of the past 24 hours were a reminder of how slippery the downward slope has been. </p> \n  <p>More than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/series/100000-dead-in-the-us\">a hundred thousand Americans are dead from a pandemic</a> after the government\u2019s botched response; there are armoured cars and troops outside Washington metro stations; men in combat gear carrying sniper rifles were seen perched in the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Charles_Lister/status/1267815222619799552\">open door of a helicopter</a> flying low over the commercial district.

A century later, it\u2019s still failing</strong></p> \n  <p><em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/carol-anderson\">Carol Anderson</a>, the Charles Howard Candler professor of African American Studies at Emory University and the author of White Rage: The Unspoken Truth of Our Racial Divide, writes for The Guardian: </em></p> \n  <p>In 1919, as soldiers returned from the first world war, many white Americans saw African American men in military uniforms for the first time. That sight, and the challenge it posed to the political, social and economic order, was deeply threatening to them. Groups of armed white men hunted down and slaughtered hundreds of black Americans across the country. The wave of lynchings and race riots came to be known as the <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/Red_Summer.html?id=2ogt4871j3sC\">Red Summer</a>.</p> \n  <p>The black community did its best to fight back, without protection from the state. In some cases, police actively participated in the lynchings. The US attorney general, A Mitchell Palmer, claimed that leftwing radicals were behind the uprisings \u2013 a false charge and one that further endangered African American lives. Palmer worked for President Woodrow Wilson, an ardent segregationist who screened Birth of a Nation in the White House and <a href=\"https://www.laphamsquarterly.org/roundtable/hatred-endorsed-president\">praised</a> the Ku Klux Klan even as it deployed terrorism to keep blacks away from the voting booth. Wilson <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/42977761,%20pages%20691-692\">had been silent</a> while whites slaughtered African Americans in <a href=\"https://www.riverfronttimes.com/newsblog/2017/06/28/first-hand-accounts-show-the-horror-of-east-louis-1917-race-riot\">East St Louis</a> in 1917, and he did little to nothing in 1919 when they again attacked and killed black people, this time on an even more horrific and grisly scale.</p> \n  <p>When African Americans fought back, when they protested, when they made clear they would not quietly accept the destruction of their lives, Palmer mobilized the power of the federal government to brand black unrest as the work of the enemy of the state \u2013 communists. It was his version of peace without justice. To do this he ignored the destructive and violent white supremacy that his president had helped unleash. He remained unconcerned about the bold, brazen killing of black people. And he had no qualms about a criminal justice system in which being black meant the presumption of guilt.<br></p> \n  <p>More than 100 years later, in the wake of the brutal, merciless killings of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a>, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor \u2013 not to mention an incident in which a white woman attempted to put a black birdwatcher in the crosshairs of the NYPD \u2013 our current attorney general, Bill Barr, does not appear to see injustice.

On Kangaroo Island that included providing reverse osmosis machines to create drinking water for livestock and to fly in 65,000 litres of drinking water for humans. </p> \n  <p>Johnson said it was the first time the ADF has been called out to assist with bushfire recovery.

McManus said the principle behind the Better Off Overall Test \u201cis a good one\u201d \u2013 that awards are the minimum conditions and enterprise agreements should therefore improve on that base line.</p> \n  <p>She said:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We want to see Australian workers get fair pay rises.

He said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We are looking at a discrete small number of awards in the industries where there has been the greatest damage wrought by Covid-19 and the necessary health responses. So the point that I make is that the hospitality award is a very complicated award. And when you listen to employers and employees who work in the system, they will note the demarcation between tasks \u2013 the 61 different pay-points and 14 different permutations creates regulatory barriers to the hiring and preservation of employees. So we are looking at ways that you can potentially simplify awards in a very narrow range of what are at the moment very distressed industries.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Porter reiterated that Morrison had been clear the ensuring integrity bill will not be put for a vote in the Senate, but still took a swipe at the construction union:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I would hope that in a time where Australia is facing the greatest economic challenge outside of a world war that it has ever faced, that people on construction sites who have been behaving in an unlawful way dial it the hell down.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-03T07:28:33.467Z\">at 8.28am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed747038f084df971c8eb48\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-03T06:45:53.833Z\">7.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>AAP has an update on the stock market:</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>The Australian share market has rallied to its highest level since 6 March, with gains across nearly every sector on a wave of optimism about Australia\u2019s economic prospects.</p> \n   <p>The S&amp;P/ASX200 benchmark index closed Wednesday close to the highs of the day, up 106.5 points, or 1.83%, at 5,941.6 points, while the All Ordinaries index gained 104.8 points, or 1.76%, at 6,064.9.</p> \n   <p>One Australian dollar was buying 69.36 US cents, up from 68.02 US cents at the close of trade on Tuesday.</p> \n   <p>The Aussie reached 69.84 US cents earlier on Wednesday, its highest point since early January. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-03T07:29:21.413Z\">at 8.29am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed73f298f087122eca548b2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-03T06:14:59.568Z\">7.14am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>On the ABC, Labor\u2019s treasury spokesman, <strong>Jim Chalmers</strong>, is asked by <strong>Patricia Karvelas</strong> what should happen to the jobseeker payment. </p> \n  <p>It is currently at about $1,100 a fortnight with the coronavirus supplement, but that will be halved from the end of September. </p> \n  <p>He says it shouldn\u2019t \u201csnap back\u201d to the old rate, but declines to give a figure, saying \u201cwe need to be really responsible with the budget.

Across the world, people of colour have mourned Floyd\u2019s death \u2013 alongside hundreds of others killed by police forces. Six years since Ferguson, the message that black lives matter has never been shouted so loudly. Will those in power \u2013 in the US and elsewhere \u2013 address these concerns?The Guardian\u2019s US team of reporters have been covering the protests around the clock.

So, since my personal beliefs were in line with [Kaepernick\u2019s] on this subject, I wanted to show some solidarity and support for my teammate. He was getting a lot of backlash and I couldn\u2019t just not support him when I felt the same way he did.\u201d&nbsp;</p> \n<p>And that backlash came directly from the NFL and its teams, who have whiteballed Kaepernick from the league&nbsp;since the 2016 season, when he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/sep/01/colin-kaepernick-eric-reid-kneel-national-anthem-protest-san-francisco-49ers\">began kneeling during the national anthem</a> to protest police brutality and racial injustice.

Did no one tell him that this would&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;go over well? That this statement is dripping with hypocrisy?

For a start there\u2019s how the message was presented. Most organizations\u2019 statements posted on Twitter are starting to sound a little manufactured, like they all have the same ghostwriter. Perhaps Goodell should have called a (socially distanced) press conference and said something along these lines:</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have seen the errors of our ways in our handling of the Colin Kaepernick situation. We as the NFL want to reach out to him to make amends for caving into pressure from the White House and our conservative fanbase, who purposely twisted Colin\u2019s message of peacefully protesting police brutality into something anti-police, anti-military, and anti-American. We know Colin was actually utilizing the example set by the great Dr Martin Luther King Jr [they love to bring Dr King into the discussion when they want to talk about non-violence, which ultimately waters down and twists his message as well. But I digress].</p> \n<p>\u201cWe know that it is not anti-American to speak out on the injustices of police brutality. We would like to give Colin a real opportunity to play in the NFL, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/nov/16/colin-kaepernick-nfl-workout-sham\">not the sham of an opportunity that we created last year</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe want to work with him and his Know Your Rights organization moving forward to bring about real change in our country because what happened to George Floyd cannot keep happening.\u201d</p> \n<p>Then Goodell can discuss how the league recognizes the power of its platform in communities and as a part of the fabric of American society etc.&nbsp;He doesn\u2019t even have to throw in Black Lives Matter, like most companies have. The NFL would have actually gone above and beyond the prettily worded statements made by various companies because Goodell would have given actual details of steps he would make to improve the situation.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"2d4c72e2-ada1-429c-ac00-dff0e7b17ed5\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1LF_Yi1xAx8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Of course, I know the statement I wrote for Goodell is far-fetched and wouldn\u2019t happen in a million years. But it would take something that drastic to make amends for the whiteballing of Kaepernick. And it\u2019s not just about one person, it\u2019s about what Kaepernick\u2019s exile represents: the suppression of NFL players\u2019 voices out of a fear of being Kaepernick\u2019d out of the league if they dare to use their platform to speak out.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>Statements like&nbsp;the one from the NFL this week are just as hypocritical as Donald Trump describing men like the white supremacists who killed Heather Heyer in 2017 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/sep/14/trump-charlottesville-both-sides-tim-scott\">as \u201cvery fine people\u201d</a> while calling protestors at the death of George Floyd \u201cthugs\u201d.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>They both reek of hypocrisy.</p>",

  "<p>Shortly before midnight on 8 November 2016, Hillary Rodham Clinton dozed off in the bedroom of her Manhattan hotel. The presidential candidate was exhausted from the rigours of a bruising election campaign and rattled by a flurry of early results that suggested the verdict was far from a foregone conclusion. She closed her eyes as the slight favourite to become the US\u2019s first female president. She opened them to a nightmare and a world turned upside down.</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s shock loss to Donald Trump \u2013 the embodiment of chaos to her bastion of control \u2013 left so much destruction in its wake (a victory party mothballed, shell-shocked staffers out of work, 66m futile votes) that it was easy to overlook the small matter of 2,000 hours of behind-the-scenes campaign footage, shot in a spirit of cautious optimism but now left to languish. Clinton\u2019s office suggested cobbling it together as an official record, an insider\u2019s account of what went wrong. But&nbsp;film-maker Nanette Burstein recoiled when the idea was put to her. \u201cToo soon,\u201d she says now. \u201cToo raw. Too disturbing for the public. I know I wouldn\u2019t want to watch that myself, never mind make it.\u201d</p> <p>Instead, Burstein received clearance to use the footage for a bolder, more wide-ranging project. <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11558924/\">Hillary</a>, the result, is a four-part biography that frames Clinton\u2019s life against the arc of the women\u2019s movement and recasts her career as a series of giant leaps and bounds. Significantly, it ends not in despair but in hope. Clinton, insists longtime adviser Cheryl Mills, is so much more than another stumbling pretender to the throne. She\u2019s a mould-breaker and a risk-taker. \u201cThe tip of the spear \u2013 the person who blazes the trail.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"872dc41094b07e17540b8915eafe54a6ba296199\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/872dc41094b07e17540b8915eafe54a6ba296199/0_0_4693_3157/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Every question is a potential hazard\u2019 \u2026 Nanette Burstein with Hillary Clinton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"673\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Every question is a potential hazard\u2019 \u2026 Nanette Burstein with Hillary Clinton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Katie Jones/Variety/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If this makes it sound as if Hillary comes to praise Clinton not bury her \u2013 well, that\u2019s broadly the case (\u201clargely flattering\u201d, remarked the Hollywood Reporter). Yes, the documentary is at pains to cover its subject\u2019s myriad missteps and controversies, be it the lucrative Wall Street speeches, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/sep/21/hillaryclinton\">Whitewater real estate investment affair</a> or the overcooked saga of her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/18/clinton-emails-investigation-ends-state-department\">private email server</a>. But the talking heads are effectively defence witnesses, solid representatives of blue state USA. We hear nothing from Newt Gingrich, Sean Hannity, Lindsey Graham, or indeed any of her tormentors from the other side.</p> <p>This, Burstein says, was not for want of trying. \u201cBut Hillary is so toxic in that community that any association is seen as bad. I made it clear that it was an objective film and that I wanted their point of view. But they also knew that she was participating, which meant that it wasn\u2019t going to be some rightwing take-down of her \u2013 and anything short of that was unappealing. There was no upside, it was just a risk.

She sat with Hillary for 35 hours of interviews, going back over her various \u2013 and often conflicting \u2013 incarnations as lawyer, first lady, senator and globe-trotting secretary of state. Perhaps most compellingly, she sat with Bill, who brokenly recalls his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/06/bill-clinton-monica-lewinsky-affair-anxiety\">cataclysmic affair with Monica Lewinsky</a>, likening himself to a weary boxer who grabs for something, anything, that might momentarily distract him from the fight. \u201cI\u2019m a totally different person now than I was 20 years ago,\u201d he insists \u2013 and the physical evidence would appear to bear him out. The former president, arguably the consummate politician of his age, now looks hollowed out, diminished and somehow older than his years.</p> <p>As for Hillary, who can say for certain? \u201cShe\u2019s not a confider,\u201d one friend needlessly points out. Instead, she sits ramrod straight in her book-lined sitting room, sipping coffee as make-up artists periodically dip in to attend to her hair. She\u2019s candid, impressive and radiates a certain blunt warmth. But on a personal level<strong>,</strong> she\u2019s as guarded as Fort Knox. Every question is a potential hazard. It needs to be quickly checked for tripwires and trapdoors.</p> <p>There is, of course, good reason for this. With the possible exception of Trump, no US politician inspires such fear and loathing. She\u2019s like a bespoke trigger for the red state white male. There they are \u2013 the MAGA army, the deplorables \u2013 burning her effigy at a rally in Kentucky and hollering \u201cIron my shirt!\u201d inside the town hall meet-and-greet. \u201cSmile!\u201d orders a shaven-head in camouflage pants as the candidate walks by \u2013 and, ever the pro, Clinton duly obliges.</p> <p>But it\u2019s small wonder that her smile is a firewall and her laugh flak. She\u2019s hemmed in on both sides, damned either way, regarded as an establishment neocon by the left and a radical feminist harpie by the right. Depressingly, these prejudices sometimes hop the fence: Clinton\u2019s decision to remain in her marriage only proved how weak she was, right up until the moment it proved that she was Lady Macbeth, a cold-blooded careerist. \u201cI\u2019m the most investigated innocent person in America,\u201d she snorts at the end of one interview session, when she perhaps believes herself to be off-mic.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e58bfc60212ead11d490bfba0a4a341a8dcb455d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e58bfc60212ead11d490bfba0a4a341a8dcb455d/0_0_1100_619/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Firewall smile \u2026 Hillary with Bill in the early days.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Firewall smile \u2026 Hillary with Bill in the early days.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sundance film festival</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Burstein previously co-directed The Kid Stays in the Picture, a spry documentary about the Hollywood producer Robert Evans. She freely admits to being a Clinton supporter and feels that most of her problems were caused by forces beyond her control, a reflexive sexism in the land at large. But Burstein does believe that, occasionally, Clinton could have handled herself better. Maybe relaxed her defensive lawyerly crouch, or eased back on the well-paid corporate speaking gigs \u2013 for the sake of her public image, if nothing else.&nbsp;</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The more you get used to seeing women in positions of power, the more likely you are to vote for it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cIf she has a flaw \u2013 and she has a few \u2013 it\u2019s the optics. Maybe she\u2019s not in the pocket of Wall Street, but to give speeches at a time when the banks are being bailed out, all the while knowing she\u2019s going to run for president \u2013 it looks bad. And she has this self-righteous quality that is her blind spot. She thinks, \u2018Well, I\u2019m not doing anything wrong, no one should think I\u2019m doing anything wrong, so who cares what it looks like?\u2019 And that\u2019s what gets her into trouble again and again.\u201d</p> <p>Bill, no doubt about it, was more adept at rolling with the punches, charming his way out of trouble, while Barack Obama\u2019s special power was rising nobly above the fray. But it\u2019s a fools\u2019 game to use past giants as a kind of roadmap to the White House. Both men (each pioneers in their way) still had to contend with a different set of hurdles to those faced by Hillary. And both, finally, could afford to be looser, less apologetic and more at ease with who they are.</p> <p>\u201cGreatness of spirit is the most important quality that a politician can have,\u201d says Joe Klein, one-time Time magazine columnist and bestselling author of Primary Colors, a loosely fictionalised novel about Bill\u2019s 1992 presidential campaign. \u201cThe successful Democrats \u2013 Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, John F Kennedy, Bill Clinton, Barack Obama \u2013 have all had it. To have greatness of spirit, you have to be optimistic and you have to at least give the appearance of openness.\u201d Hillary, he concludes, \u201cwas never going to be that\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"636c89f4a3f7932bd694bb9aa9eae343dc264ba2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/636c89f4a3f7932bd694bb9aa9eae343dc264ba2/0_86_2048_1434/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Above the fray \u2026 Clinton with Barack Obama.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"700\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Above the fray \u2026 Clinton with Barack Obama.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Barbara Kinney/Hulu</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Burstein, thank heavens, spies the obvious problem with this. \u201cIt\u2019s a very male thing to say. I mean, OK, maybe there\u2019s some truth to the idea that it\u2019s hard to pick a woman who has the kind of charm or the greatness of spirit that you see in a man. But is that because it doesn\u2019t exist? Or is it because it comes in a different package that we don\u2019t know how to recognise?\u201d</p> <p>Undeniably, Hillary offered a different package to the one presented by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>, the bait-and-switch conman who now sits in the Oval Office, presiding over a 100,000 Covid-19 death toll and an economy in the toilet. For all that, Burstein chooses to end her series not in the ash and rubble of November 2016, but amid the green shoots that have sprung up since. She spotlights the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/06/somethings-happening-how-the-womens-march-inspired-a-new-era-of-resistance\">5 million-strong Women\u2019s March</a> that followed the inauguration, the 2018 midterms that turned the lower house blue and the vibrant attempts of Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris to run for president. Obviously, it would have been heartening if one had secured the Democratic nomination. But can\u2019t narrow defeats and near misses be markers of progress, too?</p> <p>\u201cWell, yeah,\u201d Burstein says. \u201cBecause change happens incrementally. The fact that all those women ran for president in and of itself is a triumph. What happened in the midterm elections \u2013 that\u2019s a triumph as well. Because this is how it works. The more you see it happening, the more you get used to it. And the more you get used to seeing women in positions of power, the more likely you are to one day vote for it.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton forged the path. Many others now walk it. Two steps forward, one step back.</p> <p>\u2022 Hillary is on Sky Documentaries and Now TV from 11 June.</p>",
