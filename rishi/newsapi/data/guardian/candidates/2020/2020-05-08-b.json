  "<p>Thousands of people around the world are jogging to celebrate the birthday of man they never knew \u2013 Ahmaud Arbery. It is part of a global campaign to pay homage to 25-year-old Arbery, nicknamed Maud, who was shot and killed by two white men while out jogging in Georgia. Ahmaud was born on 8 May 1994 and would have turned 26 on Friday.</p> <p>The idea for a global run in Arbery\u2019s name came from his high school football coach, Jason Vaughn, who last saw Arbery when they crossed paths on a run. Arbery loved running. Now, the hashtag #IRunWithMaud has travelled the world, with runners from London to New York completing the 2.23-mile trip \u2013 a tribute to the date of his death, which occurred on 23 February. The hashtag now has more than <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/irunwithmaud/\">60,000 posts on Instagram</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/VAeducatorRJW/status/1258744510047293441\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Hand on my heart \u2764\ufe0f \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe this morning. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/irunwithmaud?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#irunwithmaud</a> \ud83d\udc51 <a href=\"https://t.co/YtjhggoaxD\">pic.twitter.com/YtjhggoaxD</a></p>&mdash; Rashard J.

For those that know me know I hate all things cardio and I got bad knees lol but I did it for Ahmaud. I didn\u2019t know the young king the was murdered in cold blood but it resonated with me heavy. Maybe because I think of how that could have been my brother or cousin .Maybe it\u2019s the ample amount of times I have felt uncomfortable in my life for being one of the few black families in my community and the stares that accompanied that when we moved in. Or the times where I\u2019ve been followed in the store because I looked \u201cthreatening\u201d and could possibly steal. or maybe the time where I was pulled over for a headlight being out and was told to get out of my car with my hands where the officer could see them. Or maybe that one time I was traveling with my family and a restaurant blatantly refused to serve us, I wish I could make this up y\u2019all \u2022 I\u2019ve been traumatized before by my own fathers tragic death. This was triggering. I\u2019m not sure how to not stop thinking about this young man. But maybe I\u2019m not supposed to. As a someone training to be a physician I feel it is my obligation to advocate for those without a voice. And with this platform I plan on doing that. There is power in numbers. Ahmaud Arbery this is for you. I\u2019m praying this brings people to realize racism has never gone away. We don\u2019t talk about these issues to \u201cbring up the past\u201d . It is very much our present day. Microaggressions and bigotry are thriving in this country. It is not invisible. #justiceforahmaud #irunwithmaud</a></p> <p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden;

  "<p>Friday was a dark day for the US economy. The labor department announced more than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/08/april-jobs-report-us-unemployment-rate\">20 million people lost their jobs</a> in April as the coronavirus shut down much of the economy.</p> <p>Here are five key takeaways from a report that will enter the history books as the worst since the Great Depression of the 1930s.</p> <h2>1) The headline figures are bad \u2013 but what lies beneath is worse</h2> <p>About 20.5m jobs were lost in the month and the unemployment rate shot up to 14.7%. The numbers are probably deflated, since a huge chunk of people have considered themselves out of the workforce, so they are not counted in the unemployment numbers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2020-05-08T13:11:25/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Embed\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2020-05-08T13:11:25/embed.html\">Embed</a> </figure>  <p>About 6.5 million more people filed for unemployment since the mid-April reference week Friday\u2019s numbers are based on.</p> <p>About 6 million people left the workforce over the month, and therefore are not being counted.</p> <h2>2) The damage is widespread</h2> <p>Some 95% of industries <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.b.htm\">lost jobs</a>.</p> <p>Leisure and hospitality lost 7.7m jobs. That industry has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/03/maine-tourist-industry-coronavirus-outbreak-us\">devastated</a> by Covid-19 closures. But the shutdown has <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/charts/employment-situation/employment-by-industry-monthly-changes.htm\">hit industries </a>across the country. Manufacturing lost 1.3m jobs, construction employment fell by 975,000. In healthcare, employment declined by 1.4 million, led by losses in dentist\u2019s offices (down 503,000).</p> <h2>3) The report has highlighted racial inequality</h2> <p>The unemployment rate was <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf\">highest</a> for Hispanic Americans (18.9%), followed by black Americans (16.7%).</p> <p>Although unemployment shot up for white Americans as well (from 4% to 14.2% over the month), that is probably because black workers are more likely to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/28/african-americans-unemployment-covid-19-economic-impact\">working in essential jobs</a>.<br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/gbenga_ajilore/status/1258750984517562370\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">This was the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/JobsReport?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#JobsReport</a> everyone was fearing &amp; for good reason: 20M jobs lost. For African Americans unemployment rose to 16.7% &amp; a similar jump for Whites to 14.2%. <br><br>This gives a historically low ratio of 1.3. Of course that means it took a pandemic to get these rates closer. <a href=\"https://t.co/XPIG57BpJi\">pic.twitter.com/XPIG57BpJi</a></p>&mdash; Gbenga Ajilore \ud83c\udfc3\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f (@gbenga_ajilore) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gbenga_ajilore/status/1258750984517562370?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 8, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <h2>4) Things are likely to get worse and we don\u2019t know for how long</h2> <p>This week\u2019s jobs report may be the low point \u2013 but there are signs of more trouble ahead.</p> <p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics is still having problems misclassifying absent workers. According to <a href=\"https://www.capitaleconomics.com/clients/publications/us-economics/us-economics-weekly/labour-market-catastrophe/?tk=74d2a252c4602a047fa061fcc7898a0cd1016954\">Capital Economics</a>, without that distortion the unemployment rate would have been close to 20% last month.</p> <p>Another 3.2 million people filed for unemployment last week, after the survey was completed. And there was a 4.6m rise in \u201ccontinuing claims\u201d in the week ending 25 April \u2013 suggesting few of those recently laid off had returned to work.</p> <h2>5) One good thing \u2013 maybe?</h2> <p>As Jared Bernstein, senior fellow at the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CenterOnBudget\">Center On Budget</a> and former chief economic adviser to Vice-President Joe Biden, noted 18 million people are on temporary layoff. The economy is opening up again in parts of the US, so maybe many of those people will soon return to work. But with no vaccine for the coronavirus in sight, and cases still rising in the US, that\u2019s a big \u201cmaybe\u201d \u2013 certainly not enough to justify a widely ridiculed tweet from White House council of economic advisers extolling the virtues of the pre-Covid 19 economy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Conway_West/status/1258759689933914112\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Sometimes it&#39;s better to not post anything at all</p>&mdash; Kyle Conway (@Conway_West) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Conway_West/status/1258759689933914112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 8, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>",
  "<p>The late 1980s marked a key moment for environmental science, matching triumph with looming disaster. Rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jun/04/latest-data-shows-steep-rises-in-co2-for-seventh-year\">observed since the late 1950s</a>, at the remote Pacific observatory of Mauna Loa, but it was only after three decades of further research that concern over what this rapid accumulation of greenhouse gases might mean reached the desks of the world\u2019s leaders.</p> <p>At the time, politicians appeared receptive to scientific warnings in a way they rarely have been since. In 1987, world governments concluded the <a href=\"https://ozone.unep.org/treaties/montreal-protocol\">Montreal </a><a href=\"https://ozone.unep.org/treaties/montreal-protocol\">protocol</a>, which still stands today as probably the most successful environmental intervention, phasing out the use of the ozone-depleting chemicals that had threatened to destroy the planet\u2019s protective atmospheric layer.</p> <p>When scientists called for a parallel effort to understand the impact of rising CO<sub>2</sub> emissions on the climate, it seemed likely their conclusions would have a similarly galvanising effect. In 1988, the UN and the World Meteorological Organization put together the <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/04/FS_timeline.pdf\">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a> (IPPC), a body of the world\u2019s leading experts on atmospheric physics and chemistry, and the emerging science of climate change, to summarise human knowledge of the climate, and provide policymakers with an assessment of the risks and possible remedies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a534cf0ab5fd4c883d08a50fa33acfac6112679e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a534cf0ab5fd4c883d08a50fa33acfac6112679e/0_0_5000_3334/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Houghton with Adam Butler\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Houghton, right, during his time as director general of the Meteorological Office, with Adam Butler, the minister of state for defence procurement, at the official opening of the London weather radar in 1985.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Unfortunately, political leadership quickly ran aground on the shoals of the economic vested interests of the fossil fuel industries. But the warnings of that first IPCC report, published in 1990, laid the foundations for the study of what has since been recognised as one of the biggest threats ever to face humanity. One of the foremost scientists who propelled the IPCC, serving as co-chair and chairman of its scientific advisory group from its inception until 2002, was the British atmospheric physicist Sir John Houghton.</p> <p>Houghton, who has died aged 88 of complications arising from Covid-19, had already enjoyed a distinguished public science career when he took on his IPCC role. Chief executive (formerly director general) of the Met Office since 1983, he won numerous prizes and accolades, including the Chree medal and prize in 1979 and election as a fellow of the Royal Society in 1972. He served as president of the Royal Meteorological Society from 1976 to 1978.</p> <p>While the IPCC\u2019s warnings did not result in the swift remedial action that some hoped for, the body continued to refine and expand its knowledge, producing regular comprehensive assessments and forecasts of the climate crisis. In 2007, the IPCC shared the Nobel peace prize with the former US vice-president Al Gore, with Houghton among those <a href=\"https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/2007/award-video/\">accepting the award</a> in Oslo on behalf of the hundreds of scientists involved.</p> <p>Houghton remained as co-chair of the IPCC\u2019s scientific assessment working group until 2002, and in that time also fostered a world-leading research effort at the Met Office and its Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research. The UK still occupies a place at the top table of global climate science today, with the Hadley Centre operating as one of the world\u2019s top climate research hubs. On 1 May, the IPCC announced it would <a href=\"https://www.ipcc.ch/2020/05/01/ipcc-pr-sir-john-houghton/\">dedicate a key part of its forthcoming report next year</a> to Houghton\u2019s memory.</p> <p>Knighted in 1991, Houghton went on from the Met Office to chair, from 1992 to 1998, the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/royal-commission-on-environmental-pollution\">Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution</a>, another landmark institution that had an influence on environmental science and policy before it was closed down in 2011 under the government\u2019s austerity cuts.</p> <p>Houghton discovered his interest in science at a young age, while studying at Rhyl grammar school in north Wales. He was born in Dyserth, Denbighshire, to strongly evangelical Christian parents, Miriam (nee Yarwood) and Sidney Houghton, the second of three sons of whom the eldest, David, became a meteorologist and the youngest, Paul, a lecturer in engineering. The family moved to nearby Rhyl when John was two, and a statue of him was erected in the town in 2013.</p> <p>He went on to Jesus College in Oxford \u2013 sometimes known as the Welsh college for its strong links with Wales \u2013 and completed his BA in 1951 and DPhil in 1955. He soon became fascinated by Russia\u2019s Sputnik missions, which he said \u201ctransformed\u201d his thinking as they opened new vistas for atmospheric research through satellites. He developed these interests further as a professor of atmospheric physics at Oxford from 1972 to 1983 and deputy director of the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory from 1981 to 1983.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5e925e185a5e15e4deb889527455e2917f3db035\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e925e185a5e15e4deb889527455e2917f3db035/867_89_1725_2156/800.jpg\" alt=\"John Houghton with Virginia Bottomley\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Houghton with the environment minister Virginia Bottomley and a weather computer, 1989.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Clive Postlethwaite/ANL/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Throughout his scientific career, Houghton remained true to his devout evangelical Christian upbringing, and worked on combining the two as president of the <a href=\"https://www.jri.org.uk/\">John Ray Initiative</a>, which aims to connect the environment, science and Christianity, and as a founding member of the <a href=\"https://www.issr.org.uk/\">International Society for Science and Religion</a>. He said of his Christian faith: \u201cThe most important choice I have made is to accept Jesus as my saviour and lord. I was brought up that way, but there was a point when I realised it was an important decision that I had to make.\u201d</p> <p>As the UK takes on the presidency of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/02/we-must-use-this-time-well-climate-experts-hopeful-after-cop26-delay-coronavirus\">UN\u2019s crunch climate conference this year</a>, known as Cop26 and set to take place next spring in Glasgow, after being postponed owing to the coronavirus crisis, Britain\u2019s climate science community will play a key role in providing world leaders with the knowledge they need to make informed decisions on rescuing the planet from climate breakdown \u2013 an effort that owes a lot to the work Houghton began more than three decades ago at the IPCC and Met Office.</p> <p>In 1962 Houghton married Margaret Broughton, and they had two children. After her death he set up the Margaret Houghton memorial fund, a research unit on medical nursing. In 1988 he married Sheila Thompson. Houghton published his autobiography, <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Ur_jBAAAQBAJ\">In the Eye of the Storm</a>, in 2013, and retired to Aberdovey in west Wales, where his final years were clouded by dementia. </p> <p>He is survived by Sheila, his children, Janet and Peter, his grandchildren, Daniel, Hannah, Esther, Jonathan, Jemima, Sam and Max, and his brother Paul.</p> <p>\u2022 John Theodore Houghton, atmospheric physicist, born 30 December 1931; died 15 April 2020</p>",
  "<p>Welcome to law and order in the age of William Barr. Against the tableau of a raging pandemic and job market in freefall, on Thursday the justice department announced that it would be dropping its case against Michael Flynn, the president\u2019s short-tenured national security adviser.</p> <p>The fact that Flynn had pleaded guilty and Donald Trump had previously accused him of lying to the vice-president no longer mattered. These days, Trump was claiming that Flynn had been exonerated and, after all, Barr was the president\u2019s obedient servant. His tweets were Barr\u2019s commands.</p> <p>To be sure, Barr had already been there before with Trump and decades earlier with George HW Bush.</p> <p>Little more than a year ago, after Robert Mueller had relayed his conclusions to the justice department, Barr issued a summary that distorted the special counsel\u2019s report and turned them into a wholesale vindication of the president. When Mueller complained in writing of Barr\u2019s deceit, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/19/a-very-stable-genius-review-donald-trump-leonnig-rucker-washington-post\">Barr became \u201cpissed\u201d</a>, thought Mueller\u2019s letter \u201cnasty\u201d and felt personally \u201cbetrayed\u201d. Supposedly, the two men had been friends.</p> <p>But that wasn\u2019t the end of his story. This past March, Barr also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/26/in-deep-state-review-david-rohde-donald-trump-intelligence-barack-obama\">earned the ire</a> of Reggie Walton, a George W Bush appointee to the federal bench. The judge \u201cseriously\u201d questioned Barr\u2019s integrity and credibility. The court\u2019s March 2020 <a href=\"https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/6805-judge-walton-ruling-on-barr-cr/2df9b5c6d7de0fef1e35/optimized/full.pdf#page=1\">opinion</a> deployed words like \u201cdistorted\u201d and \u201cmisleading\u201d to drive the point home, not the language generally used to describe the nation\u2019s chief law enforcement officer.</p> <p>To be sure, that was just another episode of Barr\u2019s fealty to Trump. In February, Barr put his finger on the scale when it came to the sentencing of Roger Stone and overrode the recommendations of career prosecutors. For his valor, Barr <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/12/trump-praises-william-barr-after-roger-stone-sentencing-reversal.html\">won the president\u2019s admiration</a>. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1227561237782855680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnbc.com%2F2020%2F02%2F12%2Ftrump-praises-william-barr-after-roger-stone-sentencing-reversal.html\">In a pre-8am tweet</a>, Trump congratulated his attorney general and trashed Mueller, accusing him of lying to Congress.</p> <p>Like Roy Cohn, Trump\u2019s personal lawyer of yore, Barr had attended Horace Mann and Columbia. History can repeat itself, in more ways than one.</p> <p>In the early 1990s, when Barr was George HW Bush\u2019s attorney general he repeatedly ran political interference for the man who hired him. Confronted with congressional demands for copies of classified documents and that Barr appoint an independent counsel to investigate Iraqgate, the extension of government credits to Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime before its invasion of Kuwait, Barr pushed back hard.</p> <p>In a rebuke to congressional oversight, Barr refused to turn over the information. In a separate letter to the House judiciary committee, Barr denied the committee\u2019s request for an independent counsel, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1992/08/11/barr-refuses-to-seek-special-counsel-on-iraq/98d669e6-6e8c-4e3c-9804-603b2267b554/?noredirect=on\">tossing around such phrases</a> as \u201cnot a crime\u201d, \u201csimply not criminal in any way\u201d, \u201cnothing illegal\u201d, and \u201cfar from being a crime\u201d. In essence, Republican presidents were legally off-limits, ditto their appointees.</p> <p>But that wasn\u2019t the end of Barr running interference for the elder Bush. After he lost his re-election bid to Bill Clinton, Barr successfully argued for the pardon of Caspar Weinberger, Ronald Reagan\u2019s defense secretary, and others in the aftermath of the Iran-Contra scandal.</p> <p>Then as now, Barr was attorney general: \u201cI favored the broadest pardon authority,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/01/14/684553791/william-barr-supported-pardons-in-an-earlier-d-c-witch-hunt-iran-contra\">said Barr</a>. He added, \u201cThere were some people just arguing just for Weinberger. I said, \u2018No \u2013 in for a penny, in for a pound.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Not every attorney general is the president\u2019s handmaiden. Likewise, not every president is determined to ride roughshod over DoJ.</p> <p>John Ashcroft, attorney general to George W Bush, refused to be steamrolled by the White House and declined to reauthorize \u201cStellar Wind\u201d, a domestic surveillance program. At the time, Ashcroft was in a hospital intensive care unit. The fact that the president\u2019s counsel and the White House chief of staff were hovering over his bed did not alter the outcome.</p> <p>Indeed, unlike Bill Clinton and Donald Trump, the younger Bush recognized that presidential pardons were not baubles. Bush commuted the prison sentence meted out to Scooter Libby, Dick Cheney\u2019s chief of staff, after a jury had convicted Libby of obstruction of justice and perjury in connection with an investigation of unauthorized leaks of the identity of Valerie Plame, a CIA officer. But despite Cheney\u2019s repeated requests for a pardon <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/13/magazine/the-final-insult-in-the-bush-cheney-marriage.html\">he was rebuffed</a>.</p> <p>At the time, Bill Burck, the deputy White House counsel, told the president: \u201cYou have to follow the law, and the law says if you say something that is untrue, knowingly, to a federal official in the context of a grand jury investigation and it is material to their investigation, that\u2019s a crime.\u201d</p> <p>The favoritism and unfairness of the process \u201cfrustrated\u201d Bush. Ultimately, the relationship between Bush and his vice-president took a permanent hit. As history would have it, Libby had represented Marc Rich, whose pardon further tarnished Clinton\u2019s legacy</p> <p>There is a coda. Trump subsequently pardoned Libby just as he pardoned Joe Arpaio, the Arizona sheriff found to be in contempt of court.</p> <p>For Trump, <em><a href=\"https://grammarist.com/phrase/letat-cest-moi/\">l\u2019\u00e9tat, c\u2019est moi</a></em>, and for Barr it\u2019s pretty much what a Republican president says it is.</p>",

Moms have long been the primary caregivers of their children, and even though more moms are working outside the home and fathers are more involved in their kids\u2019 lives than ever before, moms are still shouldering the majority of the parenting responsibilities.</p> <p>With nine in 10 children out of school, and daycares across the country closed, it is moms who will likely be forced to stay home even if, and when, their jobs resume. Historically, even in non-pandemic times, it is moms who end up adjusting their jobs for the sake of their families, not dads.</p> <p>Now, arguably more than ever, we need more moms in positions of power.</p> <p>If more moms were in charge, elected officials and other leaders would know that to open up the country without also opening up schools and daycares is to put millions of women out of a job. It also means putting additional strain on low-income families \u2013 especially black families and families of color, who are already <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/05/black-counties-disproportionately-hit-by-coronavirus-237540\">disproportionately affected by Covid-19</a> \u2013 and will continue to harm the mental health of parents, whoare reportedly <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-parents-stress-066aa3e1-d1d9-4112-84ed-c65184d04e39.html\">experiencing insomnia</a>, stress, anxiety, depression, anger, emotional exhaustion and PTSD symptoms as a result of quarantine and its implications.</p> <p>It\u2019s no wonder that Nancy Pelosi, a mother of five and grandmother of nine, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/13/senior-dems-national-plan-reopen-united-states-184135\">has called</a> Trump\u2019s plan to reopen the country \u201calmost sinful\u201d.

The women, and especially the moms, who have managed to find a seat at the proverbial political table know what the president either refuses to acknowledge or is simply too stubborn to admit: it will be women, mothers and caregivers who will be most at risk if the country reopens prematurely. It\u2019s House Democrats who proposed a monthly stimulus check to support families while they shelter-in place, instead of a one-time $1,200 payment, argued for increasing food assistance (Snap) benefits, and fought for millions of dollars in aid to hospitals in the $484bn relief package passed in April.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in Ohio \u2013 led by the Republican governor, Mike DeWine \u2013 the department of job and family services is asking businesses to report employees who refuse to return to work during a deadly global pandemic. .

Nine in 10 nurses, respiratory therapists and nursing assistants are women. Fifty-three per cent of critical retail workers are women. In fact, women make up 52% of all essential workers, and 73% of the healthcare workers who have been infected with Covid-19. And it will be women that Trump and other Republican leaders will continue to sacrifice on the altar of consumerism if they maintain their heartless calls to reopen the country before it is safe to do so. Moms will lose their jobs, financial independence and freedom, and the gains they have made as workers outside the home.</p> <p>We need more women \u2013 especially moms, who currently <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/parenting/childcare-coronavirus-moms.html\">feel as if they\u2019re working \u201cfive jobs\u201d</a> to maintain a semblance of normalcy \u2013 in leadership positions to help this country navigate such an unparalleled moment in world history.

  "<p>In liberal democracies, the integrity, impartiality and professionalism of intelligence agencies matters. That\u2019s why it is essential that intelligence agencies remain aloof, not only from the political debates of the day, but also from the policy decisions that individual governments may take.

It contributed to a massive outflow of refugees across the world, a factor in the resurgence of the far right across Europe.

The sheer magnitude of the damage means that the people of the world have every right to know how this came about. Whether China\u2019s new class of \u201cwolf warrior\u201d diplomats care to recognise it or not, there are fundamental questions we can all legitimately demand answers to. These include the origin of the virus in Wuhan; whether the earliest genetic evidence of the outbreak has been properly preserved for independent research; the danger of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/28/how-did-the-coronavirus-start-where-did-it-come-from-how-did-it-spread-humans-was-it-really-bats-pangolins-wuhan-animal-market\">wildlife \u201cwet markets\u201d</a> in the transmission of such viruses; what delays occurred in notifying central authorities; why some local medical staff were either <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/feb/07/coronavirus-chinese-rage-death-whistleblower-doctor-li-wenliang\">silenced or punished</a>; what delay occurred in notifying the World Health Organization of human-to-human transmission, given China\u2019s obligations under the relevant international health regulations. There are also fundamental questions on whether the WHO properly discharged its mandate to provide clear and early warnings to the international community. And whether national governments took all necessary actions to prepare for the virus reaching their own shores, or whether these warnings were effectively ignored \u2013 as appears to have been the case in the US.</p> <p>But amid all these questions, and the parallel debate about the mechanism now needed to conduct an effective international inquiry, we suddenly have a unilateral declaration by the US president and his secretary of state that the body of evidence <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/03/mike-pompeo-donald-trump-coronavirus-chinese-laboratory\">overwhelmingly points to the virus having leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology</a>, where research projects have been under way into various categories of coronavirus borne by bats. They claim a \u201chigh degree of confidence\u201d in this theory, citing compelling but as-yet undisclosed evidence \u2013 despite the US director of national intelligence issuing a rare public statement disparaging this theory.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The bitter lessons of Iraq appear to have been lost on Trump and the Murdoch empire that supports him</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Enter the \u201cglobal exclusive\u201d story of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Australian Daily Telegraph last weekend, headlined \u201cChina\u2019s batty science \u2013 bombshell dossier lays out the case against the People\u2019s Republic\u201d. The paper claims to have been leaked a 15-page research dossier prepared by unnamed \u201cwestern governments\u201d on the Chinese government\u2019s culpability for the outbreak. The clear inference from the Telegraph report is that the document was prepared by the \u201cFive Eyes\u201d intelligence community linking the US, UK, Australian, Canadian and New Zealand intelligence services. Other Murdoch journalists, re-reporting the story, have expressly stated it was a Five Eyes document. While the article itself shies away from stating explicitly the document\u2019s authorship, the newspaper goes on to detail a number of investigatory actions being undertaken by the Five Eyes to nail the Chinese state\u2019s responsibility.</p> <p>The most critical part of the Telegraph newspaper report deals with apparent divisions among the wider intelligence community on the authenticity of the \u201cWuhan laboratory leak\u201d thesis. And it\u2019s here that Murdoch\u2019s paper becomes explicit in its assertion that the Five Eyes research dossier helps validate the as-yet-unproven claim by Donald Trump and Mike Pompeo that the virus was \u201cinvented\u201d at the Wuhan laboratory. The article and associated stories are laced with colourful reporting about Chinese \u201cbat virus\u201d researchers \u2013 \u201cbat men\u201d, \u201cbat women\u201d and other tales from the Wuhan bat cave. Nonetheless, having delivered its political ordinance in support of Trump and Pompeo, the Murdoch story carefully and cleverly seeks to cover its traces by stating repeatedly that nothing is yet proven about the laboratory leak.</p> <p>The Murdoch journalist in question, Sharri Markson, a few days later pops up as the prime interview on the Murdoch-owned US cable TV network Fox News. The interviewer is none other than Trump\u2019s personal favourite, Tucker Carlson, who together with Sean Hannity are his cheerleaders-in-chief in the American media. Right on cue, Tucker chimes in that the dossier \u201cis the most substantial confirmation of what we\u2019ve suspected that we\u2019ve had so far\u201d and that \u201cbecause it\u2019s a multinational effort I think it would be hard to dismiss it as a political document\u201d.</p> <p>The truth is, at this stage, none of us know definitively whether the virus came from the Wuhan laboratory. The best we can do is accept the Australian government\u2019s assertion that this is at best a 5% possibility. Politically, the bottom line is that the leak of this alleged Five Eyes intelligence dossier to the Murdoch media in Australia, before being resold back into the US political audience by the very same Murdoch media, appears designed to back Trump\u2019s and Pompeo\u2019s claim. But this time with the added \u201cauthenticity\u201d factor of the dossier being \u201cmultinational\u201d and not just a normal drop from the White House to Fox, which have become a dime a dozen.</p> <p>This is all about US presidential politics. There are three issues in this campaign: Trump\u2019s handling of the virus; how to dig the US out of its virus-induced economic hole; and who can be most hardline on China \u2013 the Donald or \u201cBeijing Biden\u201d, as the Republicans now seek to tag his Democratic opponent. There\u2019s little else on the table. Therefore, using an intelligence leak pushing Chinese culpability, laundered through a foreign country, turbocharged with the credibility factor of being an alleged Five Eyes product, helps the partisan political cause. And let\u2019s be clear: Murdoch is campaigning full-bore for Trump.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/09/rupert-murdoch-open-letter-journalists-coronavirus-fox-news\">Rupert Murdoch, Fox News\u2019 Covid-19 misinformation is a danger to public health | Todd Gitlin and others</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Here are questions now for the Australian government and potentially its Five Eyes partners. First, was this an \u201cintelligence\u201d product, or was it simply open source material derived from information in the public domain? Second, was it an authorised Five Eyes product, or was just prepared in the US? Third, who leaked it, given that leaking such material is a criminal offence \u2013 as the US has made plain in its handling of Chelsea Manning\u2019s and Julian Assange\u2019s cases that included the large-scale unauthorised release of<br>classified Five Eyes material. Were any ministers of the Australian government complicit in this? Or was the US embassy in Canberra involved? If the Australian government is serious about the protection of classified documents, then why hasn\u2019t a full police investigation been commissioned? Or is the government fearful of what it might discover if, as is likely, the leak has been driven by political and electoral interests within the US.</p> <p>The extent to which the Australian intelligence community has sought to distance itself from the \u201cdossier\u201d suggests it does not wish to be in any way drawn into domestic politics \u2013 either Australian or American. The British intelligence community <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/australia-hits-back-at-us-claim-linking-coronavirus-to-wuhan-lab\">is reportedly doing the same</a>. This is good. These institutions appear to have learnt from the Iraq war fiasco and the political abuse of intelligence agencies that occurred at that time. But on this question, the bitter lessons of Iraq appear to have been lost on Trump and the Murdoch empire that supports him.</p> <p>China has much to answer for, including the ultimate origins of the virus. But if Trump\u2019s claim in the Wuhan laboratory saga ultimately ends up being disproven, either by the Five Eyes or by US intelligence itself, then the irony is that the net political winner will be China. Remember the humiliation when no WMD were found in Iraq? Beijing would seek to exonerate itself as a result of egregious presidential overreach \u2013 once again aided and abetted by the Murdoch media. This is why the watchword of any sophisticated intelligence agency is caution in endorsing premature conclusions until all the facts are on the table.</p>",

The arrest comes after a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/07/ahmaud-arbery-video-shooting-sharing-viral\">video released</a> this week showed an unarmed Arbery, who is black, confronted by the elder McMichael, a former county police officer, and his son, who shot Arbery seconds later.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/07/ahmaud-arbery-parents-call-for-arrests-killing-song-daily-jog\">Ahmaud Arbery's parents call for arrests after 'modern lynching in the middle of the day'</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The shooting took place more than two months ago on 23 February, and family members have expressed outrage and anger that the two men had not been charged. The incidents around the shooting remained unclear until an anonymous witness leaked a 36-second video including the moment of Arbery\u2019s death.</p> \n<p>According to a police report filed that day, the two McMichaels grabbed their weapons, a .357 Magnum revolver and a shotgun, jumped into a truck and followed Arbery as he ran. In the same police report, they tell police Arbery matched the description of someone caught on a security camera committing a recent burglary in the neighborhood. Gregory McMichael told police Arbery violently attacked his son, which contradicts the footage.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ff982312-edb3-412b-afb8-5d08db8a14a9\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8EysSdqmQQI?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Arbery\u2019s family has called for immediate arrests after the video was released this week.

Until the footage was released this week, no charges or arrests had taken place.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m still in tears,\u201d said Chris Stewart on Thursday evening after he heard the news. Stewart, who represents Arbery\u2019s family, is a civil rights attorney who is working with the team of lawyers representing the family, including Lee Merritt and Ben Crump.</p> \n<p>The family is overjoyed, Stewart told the Guardian.</p> \n<p>Two prosecutors have recused themselves from the case since the shooting, citing professional relationships with the older McMichael. Neighboring Liberty county district attorney Tim Durden, the third prosecutor assigned to the case, formally requested an investigation by GBI on 5 May, after the video was released. They initiated an investigation on 6 May, leading to an arrest Thursday evening.</p> \n<p>Soon after the video was released, Georgia\u2019s governor, Brian Kemp, and the state\u2019s attorney general Chris Carr called for swift action. Kemp called the shooting \u201cabsolutely horrific\u201d in a press conference Thursday.</p> \n<p>The Glynn county police department never requested an independent investigation of the incident and did not charge anyone in the incident.</p> \n<p>Thursday, the Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/07/ahmaud-arbery-killing-man-called-911-report-black-male-running-shooting\">obtained two 911 calls</a>, where an unidentified caller tells the dispatcher: \u201cThere\u2019s a black male running down the street.\u201d In another call, a different dispatcher asks another caller to explain what Arbery has done that is wrong.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"c7b8757e-9cfa-4b76-abf6-2025f7636ea1\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uFgy5ZT-1PA?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s not over,\u201d says Stewart. \u201cThis is the beginning.

It enjoyed 120 consecutive months of job growth and the lowest unemployment rate it saw in many years. It was making measurable progress in paying down pension obligations. </p> <p>Three months later, said Newsom, the state is facing a shortfall of tens of billions. </p> <p>Almost $12 billion in unemployment has been released just since March 15. Those job losses will soon trickle down to local governments, making messes out of next year\u2019s budgets and forcing tough decisions. </p> <p>Every budget around the globe will in some way be impacted by the pandemic, but the losses have outsized impact in a state whose economy is the fifth largest in the world. </p> <p>\u201cThis moment is directly related to COVID-19, not mismanagement. But because of this pandemic, these revenue shortfalls are bigger than even the state of California,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cWe\u2019ll get through this. This will be challenging ... But my optimism is conditioned on this: more federal support,\u201d he added. </p> <p>Moving forward will require a historic level of partnership between states and federal governments, he said. While the CARES Act has been profoundly beneficial, the enormity of the moment demands even more support. </p> <p>\u201cThis is bigger than all of us and we really need the fed government to do more and help us through this moment. We punch above our weight in this state. We\u2019ll come back stronger than ever.

We\u2019re interested in argument and will try to provide some flexibility. But it\u2019s a health-first frame,\u201d Newsom said. </p> <p>Among the conditions: health officials must attest that they\u2019ve had no more than one case per 10,000 people in the last 14 days, no deaths in the past two weeks, and that they could handle a surge in hospitalizations from coronavirus. </p> <p>They must also be able to conduct 1.5 tests for every 1,000 residents, have 15 contact tracers, or \u201cdisease detectives\u201d per 1,000 residents, can support homeless residents, and skilled nursing facilities must have a two week supply of personal protective equipment on hand. </p> <p>\u201cIf they can\u2019t meet the guidelines, we aren\u2019t able to accommodate that and will enforce in a thoughtful and judicious way.
