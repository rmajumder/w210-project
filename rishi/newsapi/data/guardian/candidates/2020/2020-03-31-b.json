These travellers are being quarantined in hotels and motels, though there have been some reports of those quarantined being allowed out to buy their own groceries -- which is not allowed.</li> \n   <li>Far more testing. Skegg said loosening of rules around testing -- which no longer require patients to have traveled overseas or have come into contact with a confirmed case -- haven\u2019t got through to doctors in the field. </li> \n   <li>The capacity for rapid case contract tracing must be greatly expanded as a matter of urgency, Skegg said.</li> \n  </ol> \n  <p>The epidemic committee was held by video call, with a live stream broadcast publicly and available to watch on social media and many news outlets. As with any group of people holding a Zoom meeting, there was the occasional person speaking with bizarre echoing feedback, although only one lawmaker asking a question had to be reminded to un-mute his microphone.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e82a8d58f0866297e9f3f3e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/mario-koran\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-31T02:21:08.774Z\">3.21am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <h2>Anger as Las Vegas turns parking lot into sleeping area for homeless</h2> \n  <p>Images of homeless people sleeping in a converted parking lot in Las Vegas have sparked criticism, even as the city officials describe an \u201cemergency situation\u201d and say the solution was the best option after another shelter was forced to close amid the coronavirus crisis. <br><br>Over the weekend, authorities in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/las-vegas\">Las Vegas</a> needed to find additional sleeping space for the city\u2019s sizable homeless population when a 500-bed overnight shelter closed after a client tested positive for the new coronavirus.</p> \n  <p>Officials turned a parking lot into a makeshift shelter, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ClarkCountyNV/status/1244029870461472768\">saying</a> spaces for sleeping were drawn 6ft apart in observance of federal social distancing guidelines.</p> \n  <p>Many white boxes were covered up with blue mats that could be more easily cleaned.

As early as January, the president said the situation was \u201ctotally under control\u201d. Just six weeks later the US had emerged as the new global center of the pandemic.</p> <p>In reality, healthcare providers faced a severe shortage of testing kits as coronavirus hit the US, with the situation exacerbated by faults in the testing system and restrictions on who could actually take a test.

You\u2019ll have a vaccine to go into testing.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Fauci and others at the meeting confirmed that clinical trials \u2013 standard for any new vaccine \u2013 would have to take place first.

But check it out\u2019</strong></h2> <p>On more than one occasion in recent weeks, Trump has questioned states\u2019 sudden surge in demand for equipment such as masks and ventilators \u2013 essential tools in doctors\u2019 battle against coronavirus.</p> <p>During his daily White House briefing, the president has said states are \u201cstocked up\u201d with medical equipment, adding: \u201cThere\u2019s a question as to hoarding of ventilators, some hospitals and independent hospitals and some hospital chains, as we call them \u2013 they are holding ventilators, they don\u2019t want to let \u2019em up.\u201d</p> <p>Trump also questioned why hospitals in New York City suddenly needed 300,000 masks when they previously needed 10,000 masks. \u201cSo I think people should check that, because there\u2019s something going on, whether \u2013 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s hoarding, I think it\u2019s maybe worse than hoarding. But check it out.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s re-election campaign has since claimed the president was merely echoing Andrew Cuomo, New York\u2019s governor, who has said that he has asked the state police to investigate the theft of masks. But no evidence has been forthcoming on Trump\u2019s seemingly baseless assertion of \u201choarding\u201d or \u201cworse than hoarding\u201d by hospitals.</p> <p>Governors from several states have said they have received just a small fraction of the medical equipment they need to deal with the pandemic. New York, for example, has said it needs tens of thousands of ventilators but has only received a few thousand. The reason for the sudden surge in demand for these items is obvious \u2013 there is a pandemic of a new virus that is putting a huge and sudden strain on healthcare systems.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018You can call it a germ, you can call it a flu, you can call it a virus, you know you can call it many different names. I\u2019m not sure anybody even knows what it is\u2019</strong></h2> <p>On 27 March, Trump made the above claim despite warnings from public health experts that coronavirus should not be conflated with seasonal flu. Fauci, for example, has said that Covid-19 is transferred between people far more easily than the flu and has a mortality rate around 10 times higher.</p> <p>While there was initial confusion over coronavirus when Chinese authorities described it as an unusual form of pneumonia, the world has been well aware of the dimensions of the virus since January, when China acknowledged the severity of the condition and released the genetic information of Covid-19.</p>",
  "<p>Boris Johnson\u2019s revamped communications strategy to combat coronavirus will be run like a \u201cpolitical campaign\u201d after he drafted in a new team of advisers spearheaded by his Australian former elections chief, senior sources have said.</p> <p>Following criticism over mixed messages and selective briefings in recent weeks, the prime minister and his key adviser Dominic Cummings recruited Isaac Levido, 36, who ran the Tory general election campaign in December.</p> <p>Having already a \u201cgrid\u201d of communications centred on the daily press conference, the government is now looking to bring in more experienced campaigners to sharpen the message \u2013 with the aim of boosting both public health and the prime minister\u2019s standing.</p> <p>Downing Street is pushing the simple three-part message of \u201cStay Home, Protect the NHS, Save Lives\u201d to the fore, in the same way that \u201cGet Brexit Done\u201d worked during the election and \u201cTake Back Control\u201d worked for Vote Leave.</p> <p>Until recently the government\u2019s communications strategy had faced criticism from senior Conservatives for giving selective briefings after an unnamed government source briefed ITN\u2019s political editor, Robert Peston, about plans to quarantine the over-70s before they were announced.</p> <p>Johnson has been criticised for making statements on camera that contradicted scientific advice. The prime minister claimed he would continue to shake hands with people he met, said the UK could send coronavirus \u201cpacking in 12 weeks\u201d and proclaimed that he would see his mother on Mothering Sunday despite social distancing rules.</p> <p>Problems with the strategy were addressed on Thursday by Cummings and his director of communications, Lee Cain. They held a virtual meeting with Levido at No 10 at which they invited him to take a major role in the government\u2019s strategy.</p> <p>There have already been some cosmetic changes. On Monday Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, unveiled new bright yellow branding on the Downing Street podium, which drew comparisons with the arresting colour scheme used by NCP car parks and the posters for Reading and Leeds music festivals.</p> <p>At the same time, there has been a willingness to slap down ministers who step away from the agreed line, much as in a general election campaign. The transport secretary, Grant Shapps, was contradicted by Downing Street on Monday after he advised people to shop <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/no-10-slaps-down-shapps-over-shop-once-a-week-comment-coronavirus\">for food only once a week</a>.</p> <p>A raft of former advisers have been brought back to Whitehall to track public opinion and gauge whether the government\u2019s key messages on handwashing and self-isolation are getting through, including Gabriel Milland, a former head of news at the Department for Education under Michael Gove who is known for his experience running focus groups to refine messaging.</p> <p>Ben Guerin, a 25-year-old online campaigner from New Zealand, is also expected to reprise his role as a strategist from December\u2019s successful election.</p> <p>A source said Levido was part of an effort to move the operation into a \u201ccampaigning mode\u201d, starting from last week, after a recognition that communication had not always been effective.</p> <p>A Whitehall insider said that Johnson and Cummings, both of whom are self-isolating with coronavirus symptoms, have sought recruits who proved to be reliable operators in their victories at the general election and 2016 EU referendum.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a campaign to win over the public to the government\u2019s message.

He has also done messaging for the likes of mining giant Glencore, according to sources, plus political campaigns from the Caribbean to Asia.</p> <p>\u201cHe hates the fiscal spending craziness,\u201d said one individual who knows Levido. \u201cHe\u2019s a proper conservative like Lynton.\u201d</p> <p>Guerin is one half of the Auckland-based social media campaigns business Topham Guerin, which has previously been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/oct/23/tories-hire-facebook-propaganda-pair-to-run-online-election-campaign\">exposed by the Guardian for its role helping to run Facebook astroturfing campaigns on behalf of major polluters</a>.

Is he implying that after work, these nurses get off their 12-hour shifts and steal masks so they can go sand a deck in their backyard?\u201d asked Kimmel. \u201cYou know when you overhear something at another table at a restaurant that\u2019s so crazy you want to say something, but your wife tells you not to and then you think about it all night?

The Trump administration initially wanted to freeze any progress on fuel efficiency past 2020. But its final rule, written by the EPA and the Department of Transportation, sets an improvement rate of 1.5% per year \u2013 or an industry average of 40.4 miles per gallon by 2026.</p> <p>That\u2019s far less than the 2.4% per year by which the industry has said it will increase standards without any regulation.</p> <p>The rollback has drawn opposition from nearly half of states and a significant portion of the auto industry. Twenty-three states and the District of Columbia, representing about half of US residents, sued over the changes. They said weakening the standards would kill about 2,000 more people and cause 50,000 more cases of respiratory illnesses, while making the climate crisis worse.</p> <p>California has long instituted more stringent auto standards than the federal government, but the Trump administration has revoked the state\u2019s authority to do so. The state last year struck a deal with four companies \u2013 Ford, Honda, Volkswagen and BMW of North America \u2013 to exceed what Trump is asking for and require cars, trucks and SUVs to get nearly 50 miles per gallon on average by 2026.</p> <p>Democratic-run states and environmental advocates are expected to challenge the new regulation.

  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/costa-rica\">Costa Rica</a>\u2019s president has pledged to protect the rights of indigenous defenders following a spate of violence against native communities in his country.</p> <p>Last month, an activist, Yehry Rivera, from the Br\u00f6r\u00e1n indigenous community in T\u00e9rraba, Puntarenas province, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/25/costa-rican-indigenous-land-activist-killed-by-armed-mob\">was shot and killed</a> after he was attacked by an armed mob while trying to reclaim ancestral land.

In 1978, many lands were declared indigenous territories. But from that time until today, the state of Costa Rica has not had the capacity \u2013 mainly economic \u2013 to protect the land rights of the people,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThere were people that were there before that declaration that have rights also. But after 1978, many people had entered the lands and, in some cases, bought that land without it being possible. Today, the situation we need to fix is that we need to preserve the rights we\u2019ve already recognised and at the same time provide solutions for many of the people that for many years have lived in the lands.\u201d</p> <p>Under the 1977 Indigenous Act in Costa Rica, 24 territories are protected for people with historical ties to the area. Despite legal recognition, these land rights have never been formally implemented, causing the Br\u00f6r\u00e1n and Bribri people to retake possession of their ancestral land.</p> <p>Earlier this month, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights expressed its concern about the situation in the Buenos Aires area of Puntarenas province, the centre of the violence, a year to the day after <a href=\"https://www.forestpeoples.org/en/law-policy/press-release/2019/press-release-indigenous-human-right-leader-costa-rica-assassinated\">the murder of </a><a href=\"https://www.forestpeoples.org/en/law-policy/press-release/2019/press-release-indigenous-human-right-leader-costa-rica-assassinated\">Sergio Rojas</a>, a Bribri land and human rights defender.</p> <p>\u201cWe recently started the first fund for buying land and for compensation,\u201d Alvarado said. \u201cWe are going to be presenting a bill in the national assembly as well to provide a solution both to recover the lands of the indigenous but, at the same time, have an integral solutions for the people that are Costa Ricans that need a livelihood solution. These are quite complex solutions but we are addressing it and we are following all the rights, not only on the rights of Costa Rica and international conventions, but also the commission on human rights in the region.\u201d</p> <p>But Vanessa Jim\u00e9nez, a lawyer for <a href=\"https://www.forestpeoples.org/en\">Forest Peoples Programme</a> who works with indigenous defenders in Costa Rica, questioned the president\u2019s framing of the situation.</p> <p>\u201cThis is an issue of political will, not economics. In Salitre alone [where Rojas was murdered last year], eight eviction orders have been active now for between five and seven years, but the government has delayed executing them \u2013 even before the recipients decided to involve the courts with appeals,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cAnd once the evictions are appealed, the executive washes their hands of responsibility, leaving the indigenous peoples at the mercy of hostile illegal occupants and numerous, prolonged judicial cases. The state is wholly responsible for what they call a conflict between indigenous and non-indigenous peoples.\u201d</p>",

These developments are coming so fast that it\u2019s hard to remember just how radical they are.</p> \n<p>Cast your mind back a few weeks and imagine someone telling you the following: within a month, schools will be closed. Almost all public gatherings will be cancelled. Hundreds of millions of people around the world will be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/26/us-unemployment-rate-coronavirus-business\" title=\"\">out of work</a>. Governments will be throwing together some of the largest economic stimulus packages in history.

Large swathes of the world will be collaborating \u2013 with various degrees of coercion and nudging \u2013 on a shared project of keeping at least two metres between each other whenever possible. Would you have believed what you were hearing?</p> \n<p>It\u2019s not just the size and speed of what is happening that\u2019s dizzying. It\u2019s the fact that we have grown accustomed to hearing that democracies are incapable of making big moves like this quickly, or at all. But here we are. Any glance at history reveals that crises and disasters have continually set the stage for change, often for the better. The global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/06/worst-case-thinking-prevent-pandemics-coronavirus-existential-risk\" title=\"\">flu epidemic of 1918</a> helped create national health services in many European countries. The twinned crises of the Great Depression and the second world war set the stage for the modern welfare state.</p> \n<p>But crises can also send societies down darker paths. After the terrorist attacks of September 11, government surveillance of citizens exploded, while George W Bush launched new wars that stretched into indefinite occupations. (As I write this, the US military\u2019s current attempt at reducing its troop presence in Afghanistan, 19 years after the invasion, is <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/world/asia/coronavirus-withdrawal-afghanistan.html\" title=\"\">being slowed</a> by coronavirus-related complications.) Another recent crisis, the 2008 financial crash, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/24/coronavirus-crisis-change-world-financial-global-capitalism\" title=\"\">resolved</a> in a way that meant banks and financial institutions were restored to pre-crash normality, at great public cost, while government spending on public services across the world was slashed.</p> \n<p>Because crises shape history, there are hundreds of thinkers who have devoted their lives to studying how they unfold. This work \u2013 what we might call the field of \u201ccrisis studies\u201d \u2013 charts how, whenever crisis visits a given community, the fundamental reality of that community is laid bare. Who has more and who has less. Where the power lies. What people treasure and what they fear.</p> \n<p>In such moments, whatever is broken in society gets revealed for just how broken it is, often in the form of haunting little images or stories. In recent weeks, the news has furnished us with countless examples. Airlines are flying large numbers of empty or near-<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/10/eu-airlines-ghost-flights-coronavirus-fightback-airport-landing-rules-empty-planes\" title=\"\">empty flights</a> for the sole purpose of protecting their slots on prime sky routes. There have been <a href=\"https://www.france24.com/en/20200321-french-police-accused-of-fining-homeless-people-amid-virus-lockdown\" title=\"\">reports</a> of French police fining homeless people for being outside during the lockdown. <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/09/new-york-is-making-hand-sanitizer-with-prison-labor.html\" title=\"\">Prisoners</a> in New York state are getting paid less than a dollar per hour to bottle hand sanitiser that they themselves are not allowed to use (because it contains alcohol), in a prison where they are not given free soap, but must buy it in an on-site shop.</p> \n<p>But disasters and emergencies do not just throw light on the world as it is. They also rip open the fabric of normality. Through the hole that opens up, we glimpse possibilities of other worlds. Some thinkers who study disasters focus more on all that might go wrong. Others are more optimistic, framing crises not just in terms of what is lost but also what might be gained. Every disaster is different, of course, and it\u2019s never just one or the other: loss and gain always coexist. Only in hindsight will the contours of the new world we\u2019re entering become clear. </p> \n<h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> \n<p>The pessimistic view is that a crisis makes bad things worse. People who study disasters \u2013 and especially pandemics \u2013 know all too well their tendency to inflame xenophobia and racial scapegoating. When the Black Death came to Europe in the 14th century, cities and towns shut themselves to outsiders \u2013 and assaulted, banished and killed \u201cundesirable\u201d community members, most often Jews. In 1858, a mob in New York City broke into a quarantine hospital for immigrants on Staten Island, demanded that everyone leave and then burned the hospital down, fearful that it was putting people outside at risk of yellow fever. Wikipedia now has a page collating examples from more than 35 countries of \u201cxenophobia and racism related to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic\u201d: they range from taunts to outright assault.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn a totally rational world, you might assume that an international pandemic would lead to greater internationalism,\u201d says the historian Mike Davis, a renowned American chronicler of the disasters incubated by globalisation. For Davis, who wrote <a href=\"https://thenewpress.com/books/monster-our-door\" title=\"\">a book</a> about the threat of avian flu in 2005, pandemics are a perfect example of the kind of crises to which global capitalism (with its constant movement of people and goods) is particularly vulnerable, but that the capitalist mindset (with its inability to think in terms beyond profit) cannot address. \u201cIn a rational world, we would be ramping up production of basic essential supplies \u2013 test kits, masks, respirators \u2013 not only for our own use, but for poorer countries, too. Because it\u2019s all one battle. But it\u2019s not necessarily a rational world. So there could be a lot of demonisation and calls for isolation. Which will mean more deaths and more suffering worldwide.\u201d</p> \n<p>In the US, President Trump has tried hard <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/trump-calls-covid-19-the-chinese-virus-as-rift-with-coronavirus-beijing-escalates\" title=\"\">to brand</a> the new coronavirus as inherently \u201cChinese\u201d, and to use the pandemic as a pretext for tightening borders and accepting fewer asylum seekers. Republican officials, thinktanks and media outlets have <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/republican-xenophobia-coronavirus-pandemic/\" title=\"\">claimed or implied</a> that Covid-19 is a man-made Chinese bioweapon. Some Chinese officials, in turn, have pushed the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/world/asia/coronavirus-china-conspiracy-theory.html\" title=\"\">conspiracy theory</a> that the outbreak came to China by way of American soldiers. In Europe, the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orb\u00e1n, recently announced: \u201cWe are fighting a two-front war: one front is called migration, and the other one belongs to the coronavirus. There is a logical connection between the two, as both spread with movement.\u201d</p> \n<p>When you\u2019re fighting a war, you want to know as much about the enemy as possible. But it\u2019s easy, in the rush of crisis, to put in place surveillance tools without thinking about the long-term harm they might do. The scholar Shoshana Zuboff, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/feb/02/age-of-surveillance-capitalism-shoshana-zuboff-review\" title=\"\">author of</a> The Age of Surveillance Capitalism, reminded me that, prior to 9/11, the US government had been in the process of developing serious regulations designed to give web users real choice about how their personal information was and wasn\u2019t used. \u201cIn the course of a few days,\u201d Zuboff says, \u201cthe concern shifted from \u2018How do we regulate these companies that are violating privacy norms and rights\u2019 to \u2018How do we nurture and protect these companies so they can collect data for us?\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>For governments looking to monitor their citizens even more closely, and companies looking to get rich by doing the same, it would be hard to imagine a more perfect crisis than a global pandemic. In China today, drones search for people without facemasks; when they are found, the drones\u2019 built-in speakers <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/01/coronavirus-watch-drones-scold-maskless-civilians-in-china.html\" title=\"\">broadcast scoldings</a> from police.

Lockdowns have made many of us, sitting at home glued to our computers and phones, more dependent than ever on big tech companies. Many of these same companies are actively pitching themselves to government as a vital part of the solution. It is worth asking what they stand to gain. \u201cPeople have a hard time remembering privacy rights when they\u2019re trying to deal with something like a pandemic,\u201d says Vasuki Shastry, a Chatham House fellow who studies the interplay of technology and democracy. \u201cOnce a system gets scaled up, it can be very difficult to scale it back down. And then maybe it takes on other uses.\u201d</p> \n<p>In the space of a few weeks, the prime ministers of both Israel and Hungary have effectively been given the power to rule by decree, without interference from courts or legislature. Meanwhile, the UK\u2019s recently rolled-out coronavirus bill <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/coronavirus-suspects-may-be-detained-under-uk-emergency-powers\" title=\"\">gives police</a> and immigration officers the authority \u2013 in place for the next two years \u2013 to arrest and detain people suspected of carrying the virus, so that they can be tested. The US Department of Justice has, since the outbreak began, filed <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/doj-suspend-constitutional-rights-coronavirus-970935/\" title=\"\">a request</a> with Congress for a new rule that would allow judges to suspend courtroom proceedings in emergencies, creating the possibility of people being jailed without ever being able to formally object. \u201cThose of us who follow the police know how this goes,\u201d said Kevin Blowe of Netpol, a UK group focused on protest rights. \u201cThese powers get put in place, and it sounds reasonable enough at the time \u2013 and then very quickly they\u2019re applied for other purposes that have nothing to do with democracy and nothing to do with public safety.\u201d</p> \n<p>In a 2008 <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/report/pandemic-preparedness-need-public-health-not-law-enforcementnational-security-approach?redirect=cpredirect/33642\" title=\"\">report</a> on the legal aspects of pandemic response, prompted by the increase in pandemic flu outbreaks, a team of historians and medical ethicists assembled by the American Civil Liberties Union bemoaned a common tendency \u2013 resurgent, in their view, since 9/11 \u2013 for government to address public health problems using mindsets more appropriate to tracking down criminals. This suspicious mindset, they argued, ended up most affecting racial minorities and the poor. Tactics like these can make fighting the disease harder, by driving a hard wedge of distrust between government and citizens. As the report put it: \u201cPeople, rather than the disease, become the enemy.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"4af07576-d7aa-4d4c-98dc-13da3ec13aef\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RnTfvrhJs88?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> \n<p>There\u2019s another school of thought that looks at crisis and sees glimmers of possibility. For thinkers in this camp, the example of the 2008 financial crash looms large. But where, from their view, 2008 led to defeat \u2013 with the broad public giving up a great deal while a small few profited \u2013 Covid-19 might open the door to political progress<strong>.</strong></p> \n<p>\u201cI think we\u2019re just so different to how we were before we saw the aftermath of the 2008 crash,\u201d said the American writer Rebecca Solnit, one of today\u2019s most eloquent investigators of crises and their implications. \u201cIdeas that used to be seen as leftwing seem more reasonable to more people. There\u2019s room for change that there wasn\u2019t beforehand. It\u2019s an opening.\u201d</p> \n<p>The argument, in its simplest form, is this: Covid-19 has revealed the political status quo to be broken. Long before anyone had heard of the new coronavirus, people died of diseases we knew how to prevent and treat. People lived precarious lives in societies awash with wealth. Experts told us about catastrophic threats on the horizon, including pandemics, and we did next to nothing to prepare for them. At the same time, the drastic measures governments have taken in recent weeks testify to just how much power the state <em>does</em> have \u2013 the extent of what government can accomplish (and quickly!) when it realises it must act boldly or risk being seen as fundamentally illegitimate. As Pankaj Mishra <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-03-17/coronavirus-will-revive-an-all-powerful-state\" title=\"\">recently wrote</a>: \u201cIt has taken a disaster for the state to assume its original responsibility to protect citizens.\u201d</p> \n<p>For years, in mainstream politics the conventional line \u2013 on everything from healthcare to basic living expenses such as housing \u2013 has been that even if the world has its problems, expansive government intervention is not a feasible solution. Instead, we have been told that what works best are \u201cmarketplace\u201d solutions, which give large roles to corporations motivated not by outdated notions like \u201cthe public good\u201d but by a desire to make a profit. But then the virus started spreading, governments spent trillions in days \u2013 even going so far as to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/coronavirus-us-bailout-what-you-need-to-know\" title=\"\">write cheques</a> directly to citizens \u2013 and suddenly the question of what was feasible felt different.</p> \n<p>From this perspective, the task today is not to fight the virus in order to return to business as usual, because business as usual was already a disaster. The goal, instead, is to fight the virus \u2013 and in doing so transform business as usual into something more humane and secure.</p> \n<p>In her 2009 book, A Paradise Built in Hell<em>,</em> Solnit used case studies of disasters \u2013 including the 1985 Mexico City earthquake, the 2001 terror attacks and Hurricane Katrina \u2013 to argue that emergencies aren\u2019t just moments when bad things get worse, or when people inevitably become more scared, suspicious and self-centred. Instead she foregrounded the ways in which disasters opened up human reserves of improvisation, solidarity and resolve, pockets of purpose and joy, even in the midst of loss and pain. The book was not a call to celebrate disaster \u2013 but to pay attention to the possibilities it might contain, and how it might shake us loose from old ways. In Solnit\u2019s telling, \u201cofficial\u201d disaster responses had a tendency to muck things up by treating people as part of the problem to be managed, not an invaluable part of the solution.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Get the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-long-read\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Long Read email\u201d data-form-description=\u201cGet the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\u201d scrolling=\" no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Sometimes this mismanagement is a result of mere incompetence \u2013 other times it is more sinister. In her 2007 book, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/sep/15/politics\" title=\"\">The Shock Doctrine</a>, the Canadian writer Naomi Klein laid out a dark account of crisis politics. In Klein\u2019s view, there is always Disaster 1 \u2013 the earthquake, the storm, the military conflict, the economic slump \u2013 and Disaster 2 \u2013 the bad things that people with power subsequently get up to, such as ramming through extreme economic reforms or gobbling up post-crisis opportunities for self-enrichment, while the rest of us are too dazed to notice. (In fact, Klein argued, these people sometimes engineer Disaster 1 to get the process started.)</p> \n<p>Unlike Solnit\u2019s book, The Shock Doctrine doesn\u2019t have much to say about the resilience of everyday people when everything goes horribly wrong. (Indeed, Solnit directly criticised Klein for this omission.) But the two books fit together like puzzle pieces. Both address crisis not in terms of what inevitably \u2013 or \u201cnaturally\u201d \u2013 happens as they unfold, but in terms of choices that people make along the way. And both were well-timed to contribute to the political conversations taking shape in the rubble of the financial crash.</p> \n<p>In 2008, days after Barack Obama\u2019s election, his chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, famously said: \u201cYou never want a serious crisis to go to waste.\u201d Today\u2019s leftists, for whom Obama mostly represents disappointment, are prone to agree. They feel that, in the wake of recent crises, they lost, and now is the time to make amends. If, facing a pandemic, we can change this much in a few weeks, then how much might we change in a year?</p> \n<p>For anyone making this argument, the contrast between 2008 and the present crisis is striking. Compared to the opaque financial crisis, with its credit default swaps and collateralised debt obligations, the coronavirus is relatively easy to understand. It is a dozen crises tangled into one, and they\u2019re all unfolding immediately, in ways that cannot be missed. Politicians are getting infected. Wealthy celebrities are getting infected. Your friends and relatives are getting infected. We may not quite all be \u201cin it together\u201d \u2013 as always, the poor are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/14/coronavirus-outbreak-inequality-austerity-pandemic\" title=\"\">hit worse</a> \u2013 but there is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/29/coronavirus-means-we-really-are-finally-all-in-this-together\" title=\"\">more truth</a> to the idea than there ever was in the wake of 2008.</p> \n<p>In this, the optimists believe, there is hope that we might begin to see the world differently. Maybe we can view our problems as shared, and society as more than just a mass of individuals competing against each other for wealth and standing. Maybe, in short, we can understand that the logic of the market should not dominate as many spheres of human existence as we currently allow it to.</p> \n<p>\u201cMore people are in a position to connect the dots,\u201d Klein said. \u201cIt has to do with people\u2019s experiences; for people of a certain age, their only experience of capitalism has been one of crisis. And they want things to be different.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> \n<p>That screaming buzzsaw noise in the background of this conversation is the sound of the climate crisis. If 2008 is the disaster that Klein and like-minded thinkers want to avoid repeating, climate change is the much bigger disaster they see coming \u2013 that they know is already here \u2013 and that they want to fight off. Indeed, in the years since publishing The Shock Doctrine, Klein has made climate change her central focus, framing it as the paradigmatic emergency that must be wrenched from the clutches of fossil-fuel profiteers and their enablers in government.</p> \n<p>Although Covid-19 is likely the biggest global crisis since the second world war, it is still dwarfed in the long term by climate change. Yet the two problems have suggestive similarities. Both will require unusual levels of global cooperation. Both demand changes in behaviour today in the name of reducing suffering tomorrow. Both problems were long predicted with great certainty by scientists, and have been neglected by governments unable to see beyond the next fiscal quarter\u2019s growth statistics. Accordingly, both will require governments to take drastic action and banish the logic of the marketplace from certain realms of human activity, while simultaneously embracing public investment. In other words, to think of this new level of state intervention as a temporary requirement is to ensure that we continue barrelling down the path to climate disaster.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been trying for years to get people out of normal mode and into emergency mode,\u201d said Margaret Klein Salamon, a former psychologist who now heads the advocacy group The Climate Mobilization. \u201cWhat is possible politically is fundamentally different when lots of people get into emergency mode \u2013 when they fundamentally accept that there\u2019s danger, and that if we want to be safe we need to do everything we can. And it\u2019s been interesting to see that theory validated by the response to the coronavirus. Now the challenge is to keep emergency mode activated about climate, where the dangers are orders of magnitude greater. We can\u2019t think we\u2019re going to go \u2018back to normal\u2019, because things weren\u2019t normal.\u201d</p> \n<p>The analogy between the two crises only goes so far. There is no getting around the fact that the impacts of climate change are more gradual than those of Covid-19. Most people do not feel they or their loved ones could die from the climate crisis this month, and so emergency mode is harder to activate and sustain. As Salamon pointed out to me, if we truly accepted we were in a climate emergency, then every day the news would lead with updates about which countries were reducing their emissions the fastest, and people would be clamouring to make sure their leaders were adopting the policies that worked.</p> \n<p>But it is not unimaginable that the experience of Covid-19 could help us understand climate change differently. As the virus has reduced industrial activity and road traffic, air pollution has plummeted. In early March, the Stanford University scientist Marshall Burke <a href=\"http://www.g-feed.com/2020/03/covid-19-reduces-economic-activity.html\" title=\"\">used pollution data</a> from four Chinese cities to measure changes in the level of PM2.5, a particularly harmful pollutant that attacks the heart and lungs. He estimated that, in China alone, emission reductions since the start of the pandemic had in effect saved the lives of at least 1,400 children under five and 51,700 adults over 70. Meanwhile, people around the world have been sharing their own anecdotal findings online \u2013 stories of sweet-smelling breezes, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/philipoltermann/status/1244189207867854848\" title=\"\">expanded</a> bike lanes and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/29/uk-wildlife-enjoys-humans-lockdown-but-concerns-raised-over-conservation\" title=\"\">birdsong returning</a> to neighbourhoods \u2013 in a way that almost resembles a digitally distributed Rebecca Solnit project: people catching glimpses, in the midst of a disaster, of a future they know they want and need.</p> \n<p>Alongside these hopeful signs, a far less heartening story is unfolding, which fits Klein\u2019s \u201cshock doctrine\u201d framework. Disaster 1: Covid-19. Disaster 2: the dismantling of even the meagre existing rules designed to protect the environment. On 26 March, following lobbying from the energy industry, the US Environmental Protection Agency <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/27/trump-pollution-laws-epa-allows-companies-pollute-without-penalty-during-coronavirus\" title=\"\">announced that</a>, in recognition of the pandemic\u2019s effects on the workforce, it will not punish violations of pollution regulations so long as companies can link those violations to the pandemic. China\u2019s environmental ministry has started <a href=\"https://news.bloombergenvironment.com/environment-and-energy/china-relaxes-environmental-rules-to-curb-viruss-economic-hit\" title=\"\">waiving inspections</a> that assess the environmental impact of industrial facilities. And advocacy groups funded by the plastics industry have launched a <a href=\"https://heated.world/p/the-right-is-using-covid-19-to-wage?fbclid=IwAR3v3a7oV_CSeQE448S_fMVv-CpVBTst75tAiHD7HDKUIOSi_ugkikxR6nQ\" title=\"\">public relations blitz</a> on behalf of single-use plastic bags, spreading the unproven claim that the virus is less likely to stick to plastic than to the cloth fabric of reusable bags. Looking back at the crisis of 2008, we can see that emissions dropped then, too \u2013 only to rebound drastically in 2010 and 2011.</p> \n<p>Salamon believes that one lesson of the coronavirus crisis is the power of shared emotion, which has helped make possible radical action to slow the pandemic. \u201cI\u2019m not talking about people giving each other medical expertise. I\u2019m talking about people calling each other up and saying: \u2018How are you doing? Are you scared? I\u2019m scared. I want you to be OK, I want us to be OK.\u2019 And that\u2019s what we want for climate, too. We need to learn to be scared together, to agree on what we\u2019re terrified about.\u201d Only then, she said, would governments be forced to act. \u201cIt\u2019s good that we\u2019re entering emergency mode about the pandemic,\u201d she said. \u201cBut unless we also do it for climate \u2026 \u201d She didn\u2019t finish the sentence.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p>What kind of actions would it take for the optimists\u2019 vision to materialise? The historian Philip Mirowski, author of <a href=\"https://www.versobooks.com/books/1613-never-let-a-serious-crisis-go-to-waste\" title=\"\">Never Let a Serious Crisis Go to Waste</a>: How Neoliberalism Survived the Financial Meltdown, warns against complacency. \u201cThe left thought it was so obvious to everyone that the crisis revealed the utter bankruptcy of a certain way of looking at the economy,\u201d he told me. \u201cAnd it wasn\u2019t obvious to everyone, and the left lost.\u201d How do we prevent the world from going back to a version of the way it was before Covid-19, with the virus vanquished but all of the old ongoing disasters still unfolding?</p> \n<p>\u201cThe political outcome of the epidemic,\u201d said Mike Davis, \u201cwill, like all political outcomes, be decided by struggle, by battles over interpretation, by pointing out what causes problems and what solves them. And we need to get that analysis out in the world any way we can.\u201d One major obstacle, of course, is social distancing, which certainly hinders many time-tested methods of waging such struggles, such as political canvassing and street protest. \u201cThe biggest risk for all of us,\u201d said Klein, \u201cis going to be frittering away this time sitting at home on our social media feeds, living the extremely limited forms of politics that get enabled there.\u201d</p> \n<p>Davis hoped protesters would find their way into the streets sooner rather than later, and speculated that a street action with all the sign-holding participants spaced 10 or 15 feet apart would make a dramatic media image. He lives in San Diego, and as our conversation wrapped up, he mentioned that he was planning to spend part of the afternoon doing his part by standing by himself on a street corner, holding a sign. He hadn\u2019t decided what to write on it yet, but was thinking about \u201cSUPPORT THE NURSES\u2019 UNION\u201d or \u201cDEMAND PAID SICK LEAVE\u201d.</p> \n<p>Solnit told me she was taking heart from all the new ways people were finding to connect and help each other around the world, ranging from the neighbourhood delivery networks that had sprung up to bring groceries to people who couldn\u2019t get out, to more symbolic interventions, such as kids playing music on an older neighbour\u2019s porch. The Italian political scientist Alessandro Delfanti said he was finding hope from a post-outbreak <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/staten-island-amazon-warehouse-workers-strike-coronavirus-2020-3?r=US&amp;IR=T\" title=\"\">wave of strikes</a> roiling Amazon warehouses in the US and Europe, and also the steps that workers across different sectors of the Italian economy were taking to help each other secure equipment they needed to stay safe.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/inside-the-race-to-develop-a-coronavirus-vaccine-covid-19\">'It\u2019s a razor\u2019s edge we\u2019re walking': inside the race to develop a coronavirus vaccine</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>What happens next might depend on the optimists\u2019 ability to transport such moments of solidarity into the broader political sphere, arguing that it makes no sense to address Covid-19 without at least trying to fix everything else, too, creating a world where our shared resources do more for more people. \u201cWe don\u2019t even have a language for this emotion, in which the wonderful comes wrapped in the terrible, joy in sorrow, courage in fear,\u201d wrote Solnit in A Paradise Built in Hell. \u201cWe cannot welcome disaster, but we can value the responses, both practical and psychological.\u201d </p> \n<p>The world feels awfully strange right now, but not because \u2013 or not <em>just</em> because \u2013 it is changing so fast and any one of us could fall ill at any time, or could already be carrying the virus and not know it.
