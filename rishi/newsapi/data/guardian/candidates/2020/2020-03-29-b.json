  "<p>The Belarusian Premier League is huge right now. No doubt its time was coming anyway, but the coronavirus pandemic has made it the most-watched competition in European football. As the only top-tier league still playing through the crisis, however, that isn\u2019t hard.

But in a time when almost all professional sport has ground to a halt, betting on a league many might not have heard of six weeks ago shows how committed some are to getting set.</p> <p>And the bookies are obliging. Been following the Russian Fiba 3x3 recently? No? You\u2019re missing out. Tabcorp is reporting the competition as \u201cthe most popular\u201d with sports punters. \u201cThere was already some interest in this as it will be an Olympic sport in the next Games, but overall in the last week it is up 50%.\u201d</p> <p>And it doesn\u2019t stop there.

Paused in several states last week when it was reported a jockey had been tested for Covid-19, thoroughbred racing resumed in time for the weekend\u2019s autumn carnival action after Mark Zahra returned a negative. The duty-of-care concerns attached to an industry that depends on animals aside, the continuation of racing is a godsend for the hundreds of thousands of people who either work in the industry or invest in it. And for those who follow it.</p> <p>The situation is far grimmer in the UK. With all sport and racing now halted, industries have been decimated and multitudes left out of work.</p> <p>The Racing Post, the daily bible of British horse racing and sports betting, has ceased production of its newspaper during the outbreak and is only publishing its digital edition. There isn\u2019t much to write about. In its popular \u2018What to watch on Saturday\u2019 column, readers were pointed to Australian horse racing, the Belarusian Premier League (of course) and a re-run of Minder, with the connection being that the actor playing the leading role was a fan of horse racing.</p> <p>These are indeed challenging times, with no end in immediate view. When approached for comment, a senior content editor at the UK betting exchange, Betconnect, duly obliged \u2013 in one of his final tasks before redundancy left him jobless. \u201cIt is a very hard time for many sectors and many businesses,\u201d he said. \u201cBetConnect would normally expect to trade several million pounds of bets in a regular month and spring is a particularly good time of year.

I wrote The Stand about a pandemic that wipes out most of the human race, and thank God this one isn\u2019t that bad, but I wrote that in 1979 and ever since then this has just been waiting to happen.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact that nobody really seemed prepared still mystifies me.\u201d</p> <p>King has been outspoken in his criticism of Donald Trump\u2019s reaction to the crisis. On Sunday he added Ron DeSantis, the Republican Florida governor, to his list of leaders he believes have underperformed. DeSantis has been under fire for not enacting a statewide shelter-in-place order and for allowing beaches to remain open, placing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/mar/28/americans-who-dont-take-coronavirus-seriously\">hordes of spring breakers at risk of infection</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible to comprehend,\u201d King said. \u201cI remember back in the 70s when Republicans laughed at Jimmy Carter as being indecisive and wishy-washy.</p> <p>\u201cThe president we have now, and Ron DeSantis here in Florida, these are supposed to be go-to-it guys, the guy you want in charge when something really goes wrong because they don\u2019t waffle, they don\u2019t wishy-washy.\u201d</p> <p>King, who has homes in Maine and Florida, continued: \u201cYou had Trump at first saying, \u2018This isn\u2019t really very serious, don\u2019t worry, everything\u2019s going to be OK,\u2019 then when the stock market starts to die, when the reality of the thing hits home, he\u2019s talking about, \u2018Well, take it easy. This thing is going to be like a miracle, everything\u2019s going to be OK by Easter and we\u2019ll have the churches full.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cAnd then a couple of days later he talks about a quarantine.

This whole situation is a little bit like the barn door has been locked but the horse was stolen, I\u2019m going to say, 10 days ago.\u201d</p> <p>The author did have some good news for fans. Publication of his next book, If It Bleeds, has been brought forward two weeks to 28 April, to entertain self-isolating readers sooner.</p> <p>King noted that the new publication date would be the same as his fellow bestselling author John Grisham\u2019s new novel, Camino Winds.</p> <p>\u201cI want to talk to the publisher about maybe doing a two-for-one,\u201d he said. \u201cWouldn\u2019t that be cool, a double feature?\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrat in Congress, delivered a devastating critique of Donald Trump on Sunday, accusing the president directly of costing American lives through his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/28/trump-coronavirus-politics-us-health-disaster\">constant denials and delays</a> in response to the coronavirus outbreak.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/28/trump-coronavirus-politics-us-health-disaster\">The missing six weeks: how Trump failed the biggest test of his life</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cThe president\u2019s denial at the beginning was deadly,\u201d the House speaker told CNN\u2019s State of the Union. \u201cHis delay in getting equipment to where it\u2019s needed is deadly \u2026 As the president fiddles, people are dying.\u201d</p> \n<p>About 2,200 Covid-19 deaths had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/mar/29/coronavirus-map-of-the-us-latest-cases-state-by-state\">confirmed in the US</a> by Sunday morning, among about 125,000 confirmed cases, the most in any country.</p> \n<p>Asked if she was saying Trump\u2019s early <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/28/trump-coronavirus-politics-us-health-disaster\">downplaying of the severity</a> of the crisis had \u201ccost American lives\u201d, Pelosi replied: \u201cYes, I am. I\u2019m saying that.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Sunday political talkshows resonated with alarming news about the scale and spread of the outbreak. Dr Anthony Fauci, Trump\u2019s top public health adviser in the crisis, was pressed by CNN into estimating the extent of Covid-19 in the US before the disease passes.</p> \n<p>Fauci began by saying scientists had no firm idea. But then he gave some startling projections. There would be \u201cmillions of cases\u201d and the death toll would probably fall between 100,000 and 200,000, he said.</p> \n<p>Fauci also underlined the \u201cserious problem\u201d now unfolding in New York City, which he revealed was seeing 56% of all new infections in the country.</p> \n<p>\u201cThat\u2019s terrible suffering for the people of New York,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cI feel that personally as a New Yorker.\u201d</p> \n<p>Pelosi indicated that an investigation of Trump\u2019s actions would be pursued once the worst of the disaster was over.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat did he know?\u201d she asked, echoing congressional investigators who brought down Richard Nixon. \u201cWhen did he know it?\u201d</p> \n<p>For now, she said, it was a question of making sure the president stopped failing to act.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe still don\u2019t have adequate testing,\u201d Pelosi said, \u201cand we still don\u2019t have protective equipment for our health workers who are risking their own lives to save lives.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/totals\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Pelosi\u2019s accusation seemed certain to inflame Trump, who was due to host a press briefing later on Sunday. Underlining the dysfunction at the core of the federal response to the crisis, the speaker essentially confirmed that she had not spoken with Trump in five months.</p> \n<p>Asked if that were true, Pelosi replied that the crisis \u201chas not required any conversations with the president\u201d.</p> \n<p>The ties between the White House and individual state governors who are shouldering much of the burden have also descended into dysfunction. Trump has been openly scathing of several Democrats on the frontlines of the fight against the pandemic, bragging on Friday that he refused even to talk to the leaders of Michigan and Washington \u2013 states very badly hit.</p> \n<p>On Saturday, Trump also picked a fight with New York when he announced he was mulling an \u201cenforceable quarantine\u201d \u2013 a position which revealed the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/28/donald-trump-virginia-usns-comfort-travel\">disconnect</a> between his and Governor Andrew Cuomo\u2019s efforts to thwart the coronavirus outbreak.</p> \n<p>Trump backed down. But at a news briefing on Sunday, Cuomo said: \u201cPeople are so on edge, it really panicked people.\u201d</p> \n<p>Federal health officials later <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/29/coronavirus-states-touching-new-york-city-told-to-stop-non-essential-travel\">issued an advisory</a> urging New York, New Jersey and Connecticut residents to refrain from non-essential domestic travel for two weeks. </p> \n<p>Cuomo also announced an extension of the stay-at-home order for all non-essential workers until 15 April. That carries the New York lockdown beyond 12 April, Easter, on which Trump has indicated he wants to begin reopening the US economy.</p> \n<p>There is no end in sight for New York\u2019s woes. Cuomo announced on Sunday that the state had confirmed more than 59,000 Covid-19 cases, of whom 8,500 were currently hospitalized and some 2,000 in intensive care.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">death toll in New York City </a>stood at 672. Statewide it was 965, up 237 on the day before.</p> \n<p>With New York yet to reach the peak of its Covid-19 curve, other US cities are fast moving into the danger zone. In Louisiana, which has the second highest per-capita death rate in the country, Governor John Bel Edwards reiterated on Sunday his expectation that ventilators would run out in New Orleans within a week. <br><br>More than 150 people <a href=\"http://ldh.la.gov/Coronavirus/\">have died</a> in the state, according to its department of public health, many in New Orleans. More than 1,100 people have been hospitalized, a third needing ventilators.</p> \n<p>Edwards told CBS\u2019s Face the Nation his state had received no ventilators from the national stockpile, run by the Trump administration, and had placed orders for around 12,000 with private manufacturers. It has received only 192.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re doing everything that we can,\u201d Edwards said.</p> \n<p>Detroit, Michigan, is also hurtling towards becoming a major disaster area. By Sunday there had been more than 2,000 confirmed cases in the city and 46 deaths.</p> \n<p>Gretchen Whitmer, governor of Michigan, told CNN Detroit was in a dire situation that was \u201cgetting worse by the minute\u201d. Like many other governors she has been frustrated by the slow response of the federal government in providing ventilators and essential protective gear for frontline medical workers.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/mar/29/coronavirus-map-of-the-us-latest-cases-state-by-state\">Coronavirus map of the US: latest cases state by state</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Trump has responded to her appeals for help by denigrating her as \u201cthe woman from Michigan\u201d and by recounting publicly how he advised the vice-president, Mike Pence, not to talk to her. She refused to rise to the bait, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t have the energy to respond to every slight.\u201d</p> \n<p>Coronavirus continues to overshadow the battle for the Democratic presidential nomination, between Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders. Biden appeared on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press on Sunday and cautioned against raising \u201cfalse expectations\u201d \u2013 a clear reference to Trump\u2019s much-vaunted ambition to reopen parts of the country.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe American people have never shied away from being able to deal with the truth,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThe worst thing you can do is raise false expectations and then watch them get dashed \u2013 then, they begin to lose confidence in their leadership.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The threat from the rise of far-right terrorism in Britain could be diminishing after Boris Johnson\u2019s election victory because supporters of the ideology feel they are being listened to, according to a former head of MI5.</p> <p>Lord Evans of Weardale said \u201calienated\u201d voters normally vulnerable to exploitation by far-right groups such as the British National party (BNP), English Defence League (EDL) and National Action might <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/28/britain-first-far-right-members-5000-have-joined-tories\">feel that their voices had been heard </a>at the ballot box with the significant win for the Conservatives in December\u2019s election.</p> <p>The former MI5 director general, who led Britain\u2019s domestic security service between 2006 and 2013, said: \u201cWhatever you think of the outcome of the recent election in the UK, the fact that some of the legitimate concerns that were being used as a pretext by English nationalists have now been formally acknowledged at the ballot box might be a good outcome, even though it is sort of disconcerting for southern liberals.</p> <p>\u201cThere was a significant alienated and disenfranchised group out there who didn\u2019t think the system was taking any notice of them. And that\u2019s where you need to be concerned about extremists exploiting legitimate concerns.</p> <p>\u201cDisaffected English nationalists were manifesting themselves at the extremes in things like the British National party and National Action, which fed the undertone that articulated itself as extreme rightwing terrorism.\u201d</p> <p>However, the crossbench peer warned that it remained to be seen whether potential far-right supporters would be wholly satisfied by Johnson\u2019s administration.</p> <p>\u201cAttention still needs to be paid to this group, as it is not clear that they will feel entirely assuaged as a result of the fact that people are paying wider attention to them now. Terrorist problems emerge when you have a significant population who feel alienated and nobody takes notice of them, causing frustration and anger,\u201d he added.</p> <p>Evans, who was made a life peer in 2014, made the comments in an interview with the US-based Combat Terrorism Center. He has previously said the rise of far-right terrorism in Britain has been encouraged by years of austerity following the 2008 recession.</p> <p>\u201cI suspect it is a reflection of the social pressures on communities as a result of austerity measures. There seems to be a constituency of disaffected males (for the most part, but not entirely) who find extreme rightwing beliefs attractive. And they have started to get their acts together to organise into groups and plot.\u201d</p> <p>In the interview, he said some far-right terrorists had been \u201cconsciously and deliberately inspired by the perceived success of violent Islamists\u201d.</p> <p>He added that the EDL was \u201cmutually symbiotic\u201d with Anjem Choudary\u2019s al-Muhajiroun group and described the emergence of neo-Nazi terrorist organisation National Action and its successor groups, which have described their ideology as \u201cwhite jihad\u201d, as predictable.</p> <p>He added: \u201cThere is some evidence that they have been consciously and deliberately inspired by the perceived success of the violent Islamists in getting their grievances on the table as a result of violence and thought, \u2018Well, we can do something like that.\u2019\u201d </p> <p>Last September the head of counterterror police, Neil Basu, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/19/fastest-growing-uk-terrorist-threat-is-from-far-right-say-police\">vowed to thwart</a> the rise of the far right, which the force has said is the fastest-growing terrorist threat in the UK.</p> <p>The number of white terror suspects being arrested in the UK has outstripped those of Asian background for two years in a row, and of the 25 attack plots that have been foiled since March 2017, 16 were Islamist, eight far right and one \u201cother\u201d.</p> <p>In 2018 MI5 took the lead in investigating the most dangerous extreme rightwing terrorists in a sign of how seriously the threat was being taken.</p> <p>Some terrorists were incited by extreme rightwing propaganda, such as Thomas Mair, who murdered the MP Jo Cox in 2016. But others, like Darren Osborne, who attacked Muslim worshippers with a van in north London, had acted after reading lawful material from groups such as the EDL and mainstream media.</p>",

the threat of pandemics, was not properly implemented, according to a former government chief scientific adviser.</p> \n  <p>Prof Sir Ian Boyd, who advised the environment department for seven years until last August and was involved in writing the strategy, told the Guardian that a lack of resources was to blame. Other experts said there was a gap between pandemic planning and action, and that the strategy had stalled.</p> \n  <p>The UK has been rated as one of the most prepared nations in the world, and some experts have said the coronavirus outbreak would have overwhelmed any government. However, a 2019 parliamentary inquiry into biological security was postponed and then cancelled because MPs were focused on Brexit and then the December general election.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/29/uk-strategy-to-address-pandemic-threat-not-properly-implemented\">UK strategy to address pandemic threat \u2018not properly implemented\u2019</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8097718f08af215f6fd7a6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/matthewweaver\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-29T12:48:40.852Z\">1.48pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d9a20955ed445c0ea6a2db86a1e82926b623a3dd\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9a20955ed445c0ea6a2db86a1e82926b623a3dd/0_224_6705_4023/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Library photograph of Giant\u2019s Causeway in County Antrim, which is listed as a world heritage site.

  "<p>Lots of things about modern politics would surprise <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/history/past-prime-ministers/william-ewart-gladstone\" title=\"\">William Gladstone</a> if the 19th-century Liberal prime minister was unexpectedly reincarnated into the Britain of 2020. Things like press conferences, video links and female MPs would all catch him out. Gladstone would, though, be reassured by one thing. He would easily be able to find his way around Westminster. That\u2019s because the corridors of power in which politics, parliament and government are conducted in 2020 are remarkably unchanged since he died in 1898. The warren of staircases and rooms in <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/history/10-downing-street#take-the-tour\" title=\"\">10 Downing Street</a> and the cramped Commons chamber, with MPs jostling through the <a href=\"https://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/aye-and-no-lobbies/\" title=\"\">division lobbies</a>, would all be familiar to him.</p> <p>Whether Britain benefits or suffers from its traditionalised habits and settings of politics is a <a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/the-palace-of-westminster-should-be-a-museum-not-the-institutional-heart-of-british-politics/\" title=\"\">recurrent question</a>. But the Covid-19 pandemic poses it in a new way. Parliament went on sitting through world wars and financial crises. Gladstone himself sat through the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/apr/04/story-cities-14-london-great-stink-river-thames-joseph-bazalgette-sewage-system\" title=\"\">Great Stink</a> of the summer of 1858, when the Thames became a sewer. But a modern pandemic that has made human proximity unsafe has meant that parliament cannot sit at all, and that MPs cannot do their fundamental job. Business in the chamber became a ghostly charade. Voting by crowding into the aye and no lobbies was deemed too dangerous to attempt. At the height of a national crisis, therefore, many of the checks and balances on government, and parliamentary democracy itself, have effectively collapsed. These issues must be addressed before parliament returns on 21 April.</p> <p>Now the Covid-19 virus has penetrated to the heart of government too. Last Friday, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/what-boris-johnson-matt-hancock-expect-coronavirus\" title=\"\">three most important people</a> leading the fight against the pandemic all went into self-isolation. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, and the chief medical officer for England, Chris Whitty, have all been put out of action. So has the Scottish secretary, Alister Jack. We wish them all well and a full recovery. But the disruption at the top of government is huge. The virus has done what the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-13347380\" title=\"\">Luftwaffe</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/from-the-archive-blog/2014/oct/03/brighton-bombing-grand-hotel-tory-conservative-conference-1984\" title=\"\">IRA</a> could not. It has made the work of leading the nation in an emergency significantly harder than it was already. When a government has just taken <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/24/wartime-coronavirus-powers-state-of-emergency\" title=\"\">extraordinary powers</a> to impose its rule, this is a particularly bad time to suffer that sort of hit.</p> <p>None of this is to imply that all would be well if only Britain\u2019s government and parliament conducted their business in airy modern buildings with wider corridors, state-of-the-art health and safety provisions, and better designed workspaces. Berlin has spacious, modern government buildings <a href=\"https://www.bundeskanzlerin.de/bkin-en/chancellery/virtual-tour\" title=\"\">of this kind</a>, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/22/coronavirus-news-coronavirus-live-updates-deaths-uk-italy-lockdown-spain-us-new-york-south-america?page=with:block-5e779cd58f08a08573fbf623\" title=\"\">Angela Merkel</a> is having to self-isolate nevertheless. Prime ministers have also been stricken in past emergencies. In the first world war, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/09/spanish-flu-pandemic-centenary-first-world-war\" title=\"\">David Lloyd George</a> spent nine days with influenza in a temporary hospital inside Manchester town hall during the 1918 epidemic. In the second, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/12/hillary-clinton-pneumonia-leaders-illnesses-jfk-mitterand-churchill\" title=\"\">Winston Churchill</a> had a heart attack in late 1941 and serious pneumonia 15 months later. The reality is that the world cannot be designed, or politics conducted, without risk.</p> <p>Nevertheless, there are lessons to consider and apply. Politics, like the health service, needs the best possible circumstances for it to do its job. The buildings should be more suitable. New ways, like electronic voting, must be prioritised. Before the pandemic, there was already widespread discussion about the adequacy of the <a href=\"https://www.fabians.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Post-Democracy.pdf\" title=\"\">institutions</a> of British government and democracy, including their centralisation in London. Spurning a more imaginative modern approach, plans are under way to move parliament into a recreation of the existing chamber while the crumbling Palace of Westminster <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/may/10/mps-palace-parliament-temporary\" title=\"\">is refurbished</a> at a cost of at least \u00a34bn, starting in 2025. The Covid-19 pandemic poses questions about that strategy which have to be examined. Many other aspects of public policy will have to be reconsidered when this crisis is over. The ways \u2013 and the places \u2013 in which we do politics must be part of that rethink too.</p>",

He agrees.</p> <p>\u201cWe cannot let the cure be worse than the problem,\u201d the president said last week, announcing that America would be \u201copen for business\u201d by Easter.</p> <p>But senior public health officials including <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/03/23/coronavirus-trump-anthony-fauci/?hpid=hp_hp-cards_hp-card-national%3Ahomepage%2Fcard-ans&amp;tid=lk_inline_manual_3&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_3\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">Dr Anthony Fauci</a>, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, think this is no time to scale back social distancing.</p> <p>If anything, they say, the economy needs to be shut down even further. Otherwise the virus will continue to escalate, inundating hospitals and causing far more deaths. America leads the world in coronavirus cases. Dr Fauci believes we haven\u2019t yet felt the worst of the pandemic.</p> <p>It may seem logical to weigh the threat to public health against the accumulating losses to the economy, and then at some point decide economic losses outweigh health risks. As Stephen Moore, who is advising the White House, warns: \u201cYou can\u2019t have a policy that says we\u2019re going to save every human life at any cost, no matter how many trillions of dollars you\u2019re talking about.\u201d</p> <p>But this leaves out one big thing. The \u201ctrillions of dollars\u201d of economic losses don\u2019t exist on any balance sheet that can be tallied against human lives. An \u201ceconomy\u201d is nothing but human beings. So it matters whose losses we\u2019re talking about \u2013 whose losses of life, and whose losses of dollars.</p> <p>\u201cLook, you\u2019re going to lose a number of people to the flu,\u201d Trump said during a Fox News town hall on Tuesday. \u201cBut you\u2019re going to lose more people by putting the country into a massive recession or depression.\u201d</p> <p>Wrong. Recessions and depressions don\u2019t themselves cause people to sicken or die. Their health is imperiled during such downturns if they don\u2019t have enough money to eat, keep a roof over their heads and get needed medical care.</p> <p>Last week, lawmakers took an important step to prevent such hardships. Because unemployment insurance levels in many states are so low, Democrats insisted on a provision in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/senate-passes-coronavirus-stimulus-package\">$2.2tn coronavirus bill</a> that would provide jobless Americans an additional $600 a week for four months.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/26/coronavirus-us-economy-health-lives-trump\">The economy v our lives? It's a false choice \u2013 and a deeply stupid one</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When Republicans objected that this would boost incomes for some of the unemployed higher than their pay when they worked, the bill was almost scuttled. The Senate vote on the Republican amendment was a hair-raising 47 to 47. But the provision made it into the law.</p> <p>Apparently, Republicans didn\u2019t appreciate that the pay of the typical working American hasn\u2019t increased in decades, adjusted for inflation. So a temporary boost in pay in order to get people to stay home and thereby help slow the spread of Covid-19 is hardly unseemly.</p> <p>Here\u2019s what <em>is</em> unseemly. The \u201ceconomy\u201d the bankers and billionaires are eager to restart had been growing rapidly. But most of its gains had gone into corporate profits, as shown by the meteoric rise of the stock market.</p> <p>The bankers and billionaires now urging Americans get back to work possess a huge share of that stock market. The richest 1% of the population owns roughly half of the value of all shares of stock. (The richest 10% own more than 80%.)</p> <p>So when they recommend Americans get back to work for the sake of the \u201ceconomy\u201d, they\u2019re really urging that other people risk their lives for the sake of the bankers\u2019 and billionaires\u2019 own stock portfolios.</p> <p>While it\u2019s true that we can\u2019t save every human life at any cost, and at some point may have to end the lockdown of America and accept some additional coronavirus casualties, we need to keep in mind whom we are talking about.</p> <p>The trade-off average Americans might make between getting back to work and exposing themselves to the virus is likely to be quite different from the trade-off bankers and billionaires make, especially if average Americans have enough income support to get through the crisis.</p> <p>Four months of extra unemployment benefits may not be enough. The richest nation in the world surely has enough resources to keep its people safe at home for as long as it takes.</p> <ul> <li><p>Robert Reich, a former US secretary of labor, is professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley and the author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Saving-Capitalism-Many-Not-Few/dp/0345806220\">Saving Capitalism: For the Many, Not the Few</a> and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/052552049X/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i0\">The Common Good</a>.

  "<p>As the coronavirus spread through California and the economic fallout of the pandemic began to hit Patricia\u2019s community in the rural Coachella Valley, she said a new Trump administration policy had layered worries upon her worries.</p> <p>The so-called \u201cpublic charge\u201d rule, which allows the government to deny green cards and visas to immigrants who rely on public benefits, went into effect in late February, just as the first cases of Covid-19 were being reported across the US.</p> <p>\u201cNow, we are in panic,\u201d said Patricia, a 46-year-old mother of three and daughter of two elderly parents. The Guardian is not using Patricia\u2019s real name to protect her and her undocumented family members.</p> <p>Patricia\u2019s father, who stopped seeking treatment for his pancreatic cancer after a lawyer advised that using some public medical benefits could affect his bid to gain legal status, is among the most at-risk for complications from contracting the coronavirus.

In the midst of a pandemic, health and legal experts say that policies designed to exclude vulnerable immigrant communities from medical care are fueling a public health disaster.</p> <p>\u201cThe community doesn\u2019t trust the government right now.\u201d said Luz Gallegos, who directs the Todec Legal Center in southern California. As Covid-19 spreads across the state, much of the center\u2019s efforts recently have been dedicated to reassuring immigrants that they can and should take advantage of health programs if they can.</p> <p>Patricia, who went to Todec for advice, said even though she\u2019s been told that the public charge rule doesn\u2019t apply to those who want to get tested for the coronavirus, she can\u2019t help but worry. \u201cWith this president, you can never know,\u201d she said. When immigration policies can change overnight, she said, \u201chow can we have trust?\u201d</p> <p>Even before the public charge rules went into effect, a UCLA analysis found that more than 2 million Californians enrolled in the state\u2019s public food and medical benefits programs could be affected by the rule, which allows immigration officials to turn away those seeking green cards and visas based on who are \u201clikely to be a public charge\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t stop the spread of disease while denying health coverage to people,\u201d said Ninez Ponce, director of the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research. \u201cIt\u2019s irresponsible public health policy.\u201d</p> <p>Although several groups of immigrants, including asylum-seekers and refugees, are exempt from the rule, the complicated, 217-page regulation has a \u201cchilling effect\u201d, Ponce said, driving people to withdraw from social services even if they don\u2019t have to.</p> <p>On Sunday, local health officials announced a sixth death due to the virus in Riverside county, where Todec is based. \u201cIt feels like people are between walls,\u201d Gallegos said. \u201cThey\u2019re afraid of the outbreak, and they\u2019re afraid of getting help. There\u2019s a lot of trauma in the community.\u201d</p> <p>For Benyamin Chao, who grappled with the public charge regulations before recently gaining a green card, his new legal status hasn\u2019t given him much relief. His mother and younger brother are still undocumented.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re experiencing the pandemic like everyone else, but the thing is, there\u2019s all these additional barriers to where we can get help,\u201d said Chao, 24, who works as a campaign coordinator at the California Immigrant Policy Center. He\u2019s been helping friends and family \u2013 some of whom have been unable to work in bars and restaurants, or as domestic workers or caregivers \u2013 navigate the complex public benefit rules, reminding them that community health clinics and state health programs that aren\u2019t funded by the federal government are safe to use.</p> <p>The economic fallout from the pandemic could leave many immigrants in need of public assistance now, more than ever, Chao noted. But he understands why many immigrants are avoiding seeking medical care altogether. \u201cWhen I filed to adjust my status, my spouse and I disenrolled from CalFresh,\u201d said Chao, referring to a program that provides food assistance for low-income Californians.</p> <p>Even though it was his partner, not him, who had signed up for the program, and even though he knew that taking advantage of that assistance wouldn\u2019t necessarily disqualify his application for a work permit, \u201cI just went with what gave me peace of mind,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd at that point I had probably internalized what I\u2019d heard from the president, about what kind of immigrant I\u2019d be if I was burdening the government.\u201d</p> <p>Mariana Garcia said she and her family were similarly shaken by the administration\u2019s recent policies. The 25-year-old, who is authorized to live and work in the US through the Obama-era Daca program, has health insurance \u2013 for now. But she worries about her father, who still suffers from health complications after being stabbed in the stomach years ago, who has refused to see the doctor recently. \u201cHe\u2019s so afraid of seeking medical care for the virus, or for anything else,\u201d she said, tearing up. \u201cI\u2019m afraid my parents will fall sick.\u201d</p> <p>In an open <a href=\"https://law.yale.edu/sites/default/files/area/center/ghjp/documents/final_covid-19_letter_from_public_health_and_legal_experts.pdf\">letter</a> to Mike Pence and other leaders, nearly 800 public health and legal experts urged officials to make healthcare facilities immigration enforcement-free zones. In a separate letter, 17 attorneys general \u2013 including from California, New York and Washington state \u2014 implored the Trump administration to fully suspend the public charge rule, so people feel comfortable seeking medicare for any and all health issues during the crisis.</p> <p>\u201cHealthcare is not just about addressing an emergency situation,\u201d said Ponce of UCLA. Immigrants who aren\u2019t able to get treatment for underlying health issues before they become serious are not only more likely to die from Covid-19, they\u2019re also more likely to end up in already overwhelmed emergency rooms and intensive care departments. \u201cWe want to do everything we can to help people stave off and fight infections,\u201d Ponce said. \u201cAnd that includes preventative healthcare.\u201d</p> <p>In California, where a quarter of the population is foreign-born, and more than half its citizens has an immigrant parent, leaving even a small segment of immigrant families unable or afraid to seek medical care could undermine statewide efforts to contain coronavirus, Ponce added.</p> <p>The coronavirus pandemic is \u201cExhibit A for why the public charge rule is stupid\u201d said Almas Sayeed, at the California Immigrant Policy Center. Because many of the immigrants eligible for safety-net public health programs work low-wage jobs, the coronavirus crisis has left them needing food assistance and medical benefits now more than ever.</p> <p>\u201cIn many of these hourly jobs, there\u2019s no paid sick time off, there\u2019s no paid family leave,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely insane to keep them from using benefits.\u201d</p> <p>Now more than ever, the policy feels insulting, said Garcia, a farmworker. \u201cWe are the people that provide produce for your home,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are doing some of the hardest jobs in the world.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t consider ourselves a public burden,\u201d added Patricia. \u201cWe are human beings.\u201d</p>",

He described one work site that didn\u2019t have soap in the bathrooms, even though public health experts are recommending frequent hand-washing to mitigate the spread of the virus.</p> \n<p>For the hundreds of thousands of federal workers who have desk jobs, the shift to telework amid the pandemic has not always been seamless. The Trump administration has tried to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/as-remote-work-rises-at-us-companies-trump-is-calling-federal-employees-back-to-the-office/2020/01/12/37aad040-2d80-11ea-9b60-817cc18cf173_story.html\">limit telework</a> at multiple government agencies, after the Obama administration made efforts to expand remote working opportunities. The policy shift appears to have left the government without much of a broad strategy for how to keep federal employees working while they cannot safely go to their offices.</p> \n<p>Some employees lack government-issued laptops, and concerns have been raised about the virtual private networks (VPNs) employees use to connect to government networks while working remotely. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency at the Department of Homeland Security warned in <a href=\"https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-073a\">a memo</a> earlier this month that the VPNs expose more technical \u201cvulnerabilities\u201d, which can be \u201cfound and targeted by malicious cyber actors\u201d.</p> \n<p>The agency also noted the \u201climited number of VPN connections\u201d could prevent some employees from working remotely, urging senior officials to update and test VPNs to prepare for mass usage.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think it is obvious from the lack of equipment that our federal government was caught completely with its pants down,\u201d Erwin said. \u201cIt\u2019s not as easy as flipping a switch and shifting to telework.\u201d</p> \n<p>Moe Vela, who served as the director of administration and management to former vice-president Joe Biden, said the Trump administration had missed opportunities in the months and years leading up to the coronavirus pandemic to prepare for such a crisis.</p> \n<p>\u201cOur government was severely delayed in many ways in their response to the pandemic,\u201d Vela, now chief transparency officer of TransparentBusiness, said. The former White House official noted the government \u201ctends to operate somewhat like a dinosaur\u201d, so federal agencies are often slow to implement beneficial changes to long-standing systems, which may have cost the Trump administration some critical time in responding to the pandemic.</p> \n<p>\u201cHowever, I do not think it\u2019s irreparable, and it can be addressed,\u201d Vela added. He argued the government needs to move quickly to implement a robust teleworking policy that would allow more employees to avoid public transportation and offices, limiting the spread of the virus.</p> \n<p>As the country\u2019s largest employer, the federal government could be setting an example on how to responsibly continue operations amid the pandemic, Erwin said. \u201cThe federal government should be a leader in these things, and telework is one of the primary ways that you can still get business done while respecting the guidance on social distancing,\u201d the union president said.</p> \n<p>But Donald Trump appears eager to resume normal operations, saying on Tuesday that he wants the country \u201copened up and just raring to go by Easter\u201d.

And by allowing the ability to consult a number of patients in the comfort of their own room, in their own home, in their own isolation, will allow a significant reduction in the amount of PPE required by doctors, nurses and all other frontline healthcare workers that will be taking part in telehealth.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-29T05:48:56.052Z\">at 6.48am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8031188f0878a2a48ac4d8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-29T05:26:26.124Z\">6.26am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In the past 24 hours Victorian police say they have conducted 1,430 checks that people are complying with quarantine rules.</p> \n  <p>That included 139 checks on returned travellers.

Next Saturday, New Zealand nationals will also be offered access to this flight.</p> \n  <p>People on the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/2712912542154556/\">Australians stranded in Nepal</a> Facebook page say they fear they will be trapped in the country because they cannot afford a ticket, or reach Kathmandu in time for the flight.</p> \n  <p>Michael Bonner, an Australian aid worker with Three Angels Nepal, a non-government organisation, said between 80 and 100 people turned up at the embassy at 9am Saturday local time hoping to organise a ticket home. He said many more were stranded in the Himalayas and other parts of the country and unable to reach Kathmandu in time because roads were closed.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a couple of hundred people who will make this flight and another couple of hundred stranded as the situation in the country deteriorates,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>He called on the government to delay the flight to give more Australians time to reach the capital.</p> \n  <p>In response to concerns expressed on the Facebook page, the Australian ambassador to Nepal, Pete Budd, said he understood people were frustrated, and the embassy had tried to achieve economies of scale by securing the largest possible aircraft.</p> \n  <p>\u201cMany Australians have been stretched financially having paid for bookings that were subsequently cancelled. The disinclination of insurers to cover cancellations due to Covid-19 or reluctance of airlines to offer refunds in a timely manner is not helping,\u201d Budd wrote.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe reality is that aircraft entering Nepal are not permitted to carry passengers. In all likelihood, once arrived in Sydney, the aircraft will also have to return to Doha empty. This adds to the cost. In the event there are future flights, if there are future flights, they are only likely to be more expensive.</p> \n  <p>\u201cFor those Australians disinclined to pay the airfare, or those who are too financially stretched despite their best efforts to seek support from friends and family in Australia, my only advice at this point would be to find a safe place to settle.

Hospitality and entertainment businesses went dark a fortnight ago and retail slammed down the shutters last week. Hundreds of thousands of people have applied for unemployment benefits in a matter of days.</p> \n  <p>And many of those businesses that haven\u2019t already closed are screaming for government action to shut them down because staying open with no customers is rapidly sending them broke.</p> \n  <p>Soon, the fact that so much consumer spending has been ripped out of the economy will ripple through to other sectors such as the finance industry, which employs a large number of people, causing yet more job losses.</p> \n  <p>People who have been stood down do not have money to pay the rent or bills.<br>Businesses that have closed their doors do not have money to pay their landlords.<br>A wage subsidy could help solve the first problem.<br><br>After ruling out the idea, Cormann has now shifted ground somewhat. But what he actually promised was not a direct subsidy but \u201csignificantly enhanced income support through business\u201d.</p> \n  <p>And, pressed by host David Speers on whether this would be dependent on \u201ca requirement to keep staff employed\u201d, the best Cormann could manage was that \u201cthat would be the intention\u201d.</p> \n  <p>From Cormann\u2019s answers, it appears the government is intent on trying to shove more money through the funnel of the business tax system, in the hope that some of it reaches the pockets of workers.</p> \n  <p>This obsession with using the business tax system to push money into the economy was visible from the government\u2019s very first stimulus package, unveiled less than three weeks ago but long since rendered irrelevant by events.</p> \n  <p>It\u2019s a very indirect way of getting money into people\u2019s pockets, and it\u2019s entirely unclear how it can help those who\u2019ve already been laid off. Let\u2019s hope it works.</p> \n  <p>Cormann dodged the question of what to do about preventing people from being evicted because they can\u2019t pay the rent \u2013 a question that has repeatedly been considered by the \u201cnational cabinet\u201d of state and federal leaders without anything being done.</p> \n  <p>On commercial rents, Cormann\u2019s evasions continued when asked whether billionaire retailer Solomon Lew was doing the right thing by refusing to pay his landlords. Unfortunately, Speers didn\u2019t follow up by pointing out that many other retailers and hospitality businesses are doing exactly the same as Lew.</p> \n  <p>And arguing about whether or not businesses should pay their rent is ultimately pointless. If they don\u2019t have the cash \u2013 and many don\u2019t \u2013 they won\u2019t because they can\u2019t.</p> \n  <p>Yes, these are hard problems to solve.

  "<p>In the early stages of the crisis, one of those at the heart of government decision-making told me: \u201cWe are all going to get it.\u201d You wouldn\u2019t wish a positive test for the coronavirus on anyone, but there is this to be said for the news that the prime minister, the Prince of Wales, and the health secretary now number among the infected, while the chief medical officer is self-isolating. There couldn\u2019t be a more vivid illustration that this is an equal-opportunity virus that couldn\u2019t care less about your status. A VIP protection squad of police officers is no defence from the invisible terrorist. It can get to you whether you are the leader of the country or the heir to its throne.</p> <p>The penetration of the coronavirus within the high black gates of Downing Street takes us into another situation that is unprecedented. After e-cabinet meetings and virtual news conferences and an online emergency summit of the G20, we have now witnessed the extraordinary first of the prime minister addressing the nation via Twitter video from quarantine. The breezy \u201chi folks\u201d with which he began was intended to damp down any public fright that might be triggered by the virus reaching the highest levels of government.</p> <p>In an earlier era, Number 10 might have sought to conceal that the country\u2019s leader had fallen ill and at such a critical juncture. During the Second World War, the British public weren\u2019t told that Winston Churchill had had a heart attack while at the White House shortly after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. Two years later, Churchill contracted pneumonia, which was also kept from the country. That would be impossible now. In a crisis playing out in the era of 24/7 media, when daily bulletins are demanded of the nation\u2019s leaders, concealment was never an option.</p> <p>\u201cBe in no doubt that I can continue, thanks to the wizardry of modern technology, to communicate with all my top team to lead the national fightback against coronavirus,\u201d the prime minister declared. This reassurance about the functioning of the chain of command was extra necessary because there has been some unedifying background bickering within the cabinet about who is in charge of what.</p> <p>The spread of infection into the apex of the state does add dramatic heft to the ministerial mantra that \u201cwe are all in this together\u201d. It is hoped within government that this will be persuasive on the stubborn minority of the population who have been putting themselves and others in potential danger by resisting the new rules on social distancing. If the infection of the head of government and the next head of state won\u2019t persuade the irresponsible minority to take this menace seriously, it is a bit hard to know what will.</p> <p>There might have been fewer issues with securing comprehensive public compliance with social distancing had there not been too many days when the government issued advice that was confusing and contradictory. The prime minister himself has been particularly wanting in this respect. He urged people to stay away from at-risk relatives only then to tell reporters that he would be going to see his mother on Mother\u2019s Day. Only on Monday did government messaging start to achieve the necessary clarity when Mr Johnson gave his television address, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/24/boris-johnsons-covid-19-address-is-one-of-most-watched-tv-programmes-ever\">one watched live</a> by 27 million people, ordering the national lockdown. If there is one further silver lining to his own infection, it is this. He was offered another opportunity to make amends for earlier chaotic messaging by reinforcing the \u201cstay at home\u201d injunction to the nation.</p> <p>There have been personal brickbats tossed at Mr Johnson since his infection was revealed, with some suggesting that he exposed himself to the virus by being cavalier about following his own government\u2019s advice on social distancing. More significantly, there has been serious criticism of the government\u2019s shifts in approach, and some fierce complaint from doctors and nurses about shortages of vital resources, especially protective equipment for health workers dealing with the infected and testing kits for frontline staff. Yet this has so far not come at any evident political cost to the government. Our Opinium poll today suggests that 92% of the public back the lockdown. Reflecting similar results from other survey organisations, the poll also indicates that trust in the prime minister has gone up.</p> <p>This probably has little to do with how the prime minister is objectively performing. Leaders of wildly varying characters presiding over differing responses to the pandemic are seeing a similar coronavirus popularity dividend. Emmanuel Macron has become better regarded among the French. Germans are more appreciative of Angela Merkel. Despite the grim state of affairs in Italy, Giuseppe Conte, the leader of its strange coalition government, has seen his approval rating leap from 44% in February to more than 70%. Donald \u201cit\u2019s going to disappear\u201d Trump\u2019s sensationally reckless responses to the crisis have been accompanied by a rise in his ratings. Moon Jae-in, the president of South Korea, has never been more popular.</p> <p>The Americans have a phrase for the impulse of people to want to unite behind their leaders at a time of emergency, especially when the threat comes with an existential dimension. They call it \u201crallying round the flag\u201d. George W Bush saw a massive surge in his approval ratings in the immediate aftermath of the terror attacks on the Twin Towers. John F Kennedy\u2019s ratings soared during the Cuban missile crisis and in the aftermath of the Bay of Pigs misadventure. About the latter, he quipped to friends: \u201cThe worse I do, the more popular I get.\u201d</p> <p>We British lack an agreed term for this effect: \u201cHang on to nurse\u201d would be particularly appropriate to the coronavirus crisis. Gordon Brown, generally a deeply unpopular prime minister, enjoyed a big surge in his ratings during the Great Crash in 2008. The more severe the emergency, the more the instinctive response of the public is to want to get behind its government.</p> <p>Fearful people need the comfort of thinking they are in the hands of capable leaders. In benign times, there is not much psychological cost to ourselves to regard politicians as useless knaves. In an emergency, many of us need to believe that there are smart people at the top who know what to do. This is accompanied by a desire for national solidarity, that yearning made manifest on Thursday night when so many people stood at their doors and windows to clap their salutations and thanks to NHS workers. The urge to pull together has also been demonstrated by the 700,000 applications to join the new NHS volunteers organisation.</p> <p>Shrewd opposition politicians understand this mood and grasp that the public are likely to react badly to anything that smells of petty point-scoring. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, had every right to articulate legitimate anxieties about allowing construction projects to continue in the capital, but he was careful to use his voice in a tempered way. Labour\u2019s health spokesman, Jonathan Ashworth, made a fool of himself during the election, but has found redemption with a carefully calibrated, non-hyperbolic approach towards criticising the government.</p> <p>This means that, politically speaking, we are in the phoney war period of the crisis. Even when the government has made egregious blunders, such as over the procurement of additional ventilators, the opposition isn\u2019t being very aggressive about it. Much of the public is willing to defer to authority and extend to the government a benefit of the doubt that it would not normally receive. This will not last for ever. The surge in approval enjoyed by Gordon Brown during the initial phases of the financial crisis faded away as national debate turned to issues about his stewardship of the financial system over the previous decade. There will one day be a great reckoning about the coronavirus, its origins, its spread and how it was tackled. Why wasn\u2019t Britain better prepared for a pandemic? Was the health service inadequately staffed and equipped? Did the government initially underestimate the virulence of the disease and what that meant for the NHS? Was the prime minister too slow to order the lockdown and other critical steps? These are some of the questions that will preoccupy the inevitable inquiry the other side of this crisis. Boris Johnson\u2019s currently buoyant approval ratings tell us nothing about what the public will think of him by the time this is over.</p> <p>\u2022<em> Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer</em></p>",

New York is by far the state heaviest hit.</p> <p>\u201cWhy you would want to just create total pandemonium on top of a pandemic I have no idea,\u201d Cuomo said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s totally opposite with what the president would want to do, work with the states, get the economy running and get some sense of stability. You wouldn\u2019t at this point literally fracture the entire nation because it\u2019s not just New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, it\u2019s Louisiana and New Orleans.

If we start walling off areas all across the country it would just be totally bizarre, counterproductive, anti-American, anti-social.\u201d</p> <p>Trump suggested imposing a quarantine earlier in the day, as he left the White House for a visit to Norfolk, Virginia. \u201cWe might not have to do it, but there\u2019s a possibility that sometime today we\u2019ll do a quarantine, short-term, two weeks on New York. Probably New Jersey, certain parts of Connecticut. This would be an enforceable quarantine. I\u2019d rather not do it, but maybe we need it.\u201d</p> <p>Later the president wrote: \u201cOn the recommendation of the White House coronavirus task force, and upon consultation with the governors of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, I have asked [the CDC] to issue a strong travel advisory, to be administered by the governors, in consultation with the federal government. A quarantine will not be necessary.\u201d</p> <p>Cuomo said Trump had not mentioned it when they had spoken in the morning about a US navy hospital ship being deployed to New York City and four temporary hospital sites. \u201cIf the president was considering this, he would have called me,\u201d Cuomo said, adding: \u201cThis would be a federal declaration of war on states.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a time when the president says he\u2019s trying to restart the economy. New York is the financial sector. You geographically restrict a state, you would paralyze the financial sector.\u201d</p> <p>In an earlier press conference from Albany, the governor seemed blindsided by the president\u2019s comments and a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1243953994743103489\">tweet</a> in which Trump said: \u201cI am giving consideration to a QUARANTINE of developing \u2018hot spots\u2019, New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. A decision will be made, one way or another, shortly.\u201d</p> <p>In Norfolk to say farewell to the USNS Comfort, Trump said \u201cthis great ship\u201d was \u201ca 70,000-ton message of hope and solidarity to the incredible people of New York, a place I know very well, a place I love.\u201d</p> <p>But the president added: \u201cWe will stop at nothing to protect the health of New Yorkers, and the health of people in our country.\u201d</p> <p>He also said any quarantine would \u201cnot apply to people such as truckers from outside the New York area. It won\u2019t affect trade in any way.\u201d</p> <p>Cuomo also continued to weigh the need for ventilators in New York, which with more than 52,000 positive coronavirus tests has more known infections than any other state. Trump this week told Fox News: \u201cI don\u2019t believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators.\u201d</p> <p>At his Albany press conference, Cuomo held a \u201cbag valve mask\u201d, in effect a manual ventilator.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We will stop at nothing to protect the health of New Yorkers, and the health of people in our country</p> <footer> <cite>Donald Trump</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThis is the alternative if you don\u2019t have the ventilators,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are actually buying these.

The taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, said on Friday evening that from midnight people should stay home for two weeks, until 12 April, in a significant tightening of curbs on social and commercial life. <br></li> \n   <li><strong>Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro insinuated that the number of coronavirus cases was being inflated for political purposes. </strong>He added: \u201cSome people will die. I\u2019m sorry. That\u2019s life.\u201d</li> \n   <li><strong>Syria said on Friday it was banning travel between cities and governorates</strong> as part of tightening measures to curb the spread of coronavirus. Syria has recorded five cases of corona virus so far but relief agencies worry that any outbreak could be lethal after years of conflict that has ravaged its healthcare system.</li> \n   <li><strong>The UK has again recorded its biggest daily rise in coronavirus deaths.</strong> In the last 24 hours, 181 people have died after testing positive for Covid-19. It comes after 115 deaths were recorded the day before. The UK death toll stands at 759, with 14,579 confirmed cases.</li> \n   <li><strong>Boris Johnson has tested positive for coronavirus</strong> and is exhibiting \u201cmild symptoms\u201d.

The UK prime minister, 55, said he was now self-isolating and working from home and would continue to lead the national fightback against the virus.

The country now has 64,059 confirmed cases up from 56,188 yesterday.</li> \n   <li><strong>The Spanish government has withdrawn 9,000 Chinese-made coronavirus testing kits</strong> from use after it emerged that they had an accurate detection rate of just 30%. </li> \n   <li><strong>The number of cases in Iran has risen to 32,332,</strong> while the number of deaths hits 2,378, according to the country\u2019s health ministry. </li> \n   <li><strong> </strong><strong>Covid-19 continues its spread across the African continent with 3243 cases and 83 deaths now recorded.</strong> South Africa has reported its first deaths resulting from Covid-19.

Italy had 919 new fatalities, taking the total to 9,134. The update follows a warning from the head of the country\u2019s national health institute that infections have not yet reached their peak and that lockdown measures will have to be extended.</li> \n   <li><strong>France extended its lockdown by a fortnight.</strong> France has recorded 299 Covid-19 deaths in the last 24 hours, the prime minister announced in a speech. Edouard Philippe said it was clear that the country was \u201cjust at the beginning of this epidemic wave\u201d. </li> \n   <li><strong>A spike in coronavirus patients means hospitals in and around Paris will reach saturation point within 48 hours, </strong>said the head of the French Hospital Federation.</li> \n   <li><strong>Four died on a cruise ship after the outbreak.</strong> Four people have died on a cruise ship stranded off the coast of Panama after a Covid-19 outbreak on board, the boat\u2019s owners have confirmed.</li> \n   <li><strong>The US approved a $2.2tn economic stimulus package.</strong> Congress has given final approval for a $2.2tn financial package designed to rush federal aid to workers, businesses and a healthcare system ravaged by the virus, after politicians united to overcome a last-minute attempt to delay its passage.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-28T00:40:29.843Z\">at 12.40am GMT</time></p> \n</div>"
