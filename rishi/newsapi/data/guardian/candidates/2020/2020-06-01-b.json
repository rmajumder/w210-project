  "<p>Donald Trump has urged US governors and law enforcement officials to take a more forceful approach in responding to protests sparked by the death of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a>, an African American man who pleaded for air as a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee against his neck for several minutes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/george-floyd-protests-editorials-worldwide\">\u2018Rotten racism\u2019: newspapers around the world react to George Floyd protests</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The weekend saw the most widespread civil unrest in the US since the assassination of Martin Luther King in 1968.</p> <p>In a group call on Monday morning of which the Guardian obtained a recording, the president, accompanied by attorney general Bill Barr and secretary of defense Mark Esper, repeatedly urged participants to act more forcefully.</p> <p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t dominate your city and your state, they\u2019re going to walk away with you,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIn Washington we\u2019re going to do something people haven\u2019t seen before.\u201d</p> <p>The call came amid alarm across the US, as some protests have descended into rioting and looting. In many states, governors have activated national guard units.</p> <p>Nonetheless, the president repeatedly warned governors against being \u201coverridden\u201d and argued that if they did not dominate protesters, \u201cyou\u2019re wasting your time, they are gonna run over you, you\u2019re going to look like a bunch of jerks.\u201d</p> <p>Trump repeatedly blasted New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles, cities with Democratic mayors, in states with Democratic governors.</p> <p>\u201cNew York is going to have to toughen up,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll send you national guard if you want. What\u2019s going on in New York is terrible, it\u2019s terrible.</p> <p>\u201cPhiladelphia, you gotta toughen up \u2026 You\u2019ve got a big national guard out there that\u2019s ready to come out and fight like hell.\u201d</p> <p>But Trump also repeatedly praised Minnesota governor Tim Walz, a Democrat, who he said \u201cknocked [protesters] out so fast it was like bowling pins\u201d. He also said Phil Murphy, another Democrat, \u201cdid a very good job in New Jersey\u201d.</p> <p>The president described Minnesota as \u201cour experiment\u201d in how to handle the protests.</p> <p>\u201cYou had the first part which was weak and pathetic,\u201d he said, \u201cand you had the second part which was domination.\u201d</p> <p>Trump also urged that states should enact laws against flag burning \u2013 a <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/other/background-flag-desecration-amendment#:~:text=Johnson.,protected%20form%20of%20free%20speech.\">first amendment right</a>.</p> <p>Trump repeatedly said the protesters were from the \u201cradical left\u201d and likened the protests to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/occupy-wall-street\">Occupy Wall Street</a> movement in 2011, speaking favourably of how those protests were forcibly put down.</p> <p>The response was mixed. Maine governor Janet Mills asked for Trump and his team to share intelligence on \u201cprofessional instigators\u201d from out of state, but also expressed concern about an upcoming visit by Trump.</p> <p>West Virginia governor Jim Justice, a Republican, said: \u201cYou come to West Virginia. We\u2019re not going to have a problem here.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, now that sounds a lot different than the governor of Maine,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI think she talked me into it. She doesn\u2019t know me very well.\u201d</p> <p>Illinois governor JB Pritzker said he was \u201cextraordinarily concerned\u201d by Trump\u2019s rhetoric surrounding Floyd\u2019s death, which he said was \u201cmaking it worse\u201d.</p> <p>Trump shot back that he didn\u2019t like the Democrat\u2019s \u201crhetoric either\u201d and said he had repeatedly addressed his horror over Floyd\u2019s death.</p> <p>Others supported Trump. Arizona governor Doug Ducey said \u201cthe more aggressive approach does work\u201d. Maryland governor Larry Hogan said \u201cI agree in peace through strength.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s theme was crush, or be crushed.</p> <p>\u201cThey come armed with bricks,\u201d he said. \u201cThey come armed with bricks and rocks.\u201d</p> <p>Former vice-president Joe Biden, the de facto Democratic presidential nominee, in contrast sought advice from mayors including Atlanta\u2019s<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/17/atlanta-mayor-keisha-lance-bottoms-coronavirus\">Keisha Lance Bottoms</a>, Chicago\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/02/chicago-lori-lightfoot-elected-first-black-female-mayor\">Lori Lightfoot</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/may/31/george-floyd-protests-latest-news-riots-us-cities-donald-trump-police-brutality-live?page=with:block-5ed3ab628f087122eca52ceb#block-5ed3ab628f087122eca52ceb\">Melvin Carter</a> of St Paul, Minneapolis\u2019s \u201ctwin city\u201d, who are all African American, on balancing \u201ckeeping people safe\u201d while \u201cacknowledging the incredible pain and anger that is the root of these protests\u201d.</p> <p>Biden said on Monday: \u201cPeople are angry. I\u2019m angry. And the fact is we need that anger, we need that to tell us to move forward, it helps us push through this pain to reach the other side, to hopefully greater progress, equality and inclusion and opportunity in our country.\u201d</p> <p>Across the country, protests have been mostly peaceful by day but some have turned violent at night, buildings set ablaze, shops looted, police firing rubber bullets and teargas. At least 4,400 arrests have been made, according to the Associated Press.</p> <p>The New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, announced that there would be a curfew mandated for New York City Monday night 11pm until 5am Tuesday, and a doubling of policing.</p> <p>A man was killed in Louisville, Kentucky, after police and national guardsmen \u201creturned fire\u201d&nbsp;while dispersing a crowd. Democratic governor&nbsp;Andy Beshear&nbsp;said the incident would be investigated. In Indianapolis, two were reported dead, adding to deaths in Detroit and Minneapolis.</p> <p>Trump is facing widespread criticism for tweets starkly demanding \u201claw and order\u201d, threatening to unleash \u201cvicious dogs\u201d and blaming fringe leftwing groups for inciting violence.</p> <p>The president, also grappling with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus</a> pandemic, did not appear in public on Sunday and was not scheduled to do so on Monday. There have been protests outside the White House for three days in a row. On Friday, Trump, his wife, Melania, and their son Barron were&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/31/trump-flees-to-bunker-as-protests-over-george-floyd-rage-outside-white-house\">rushed to</a>&nbsp;a bunker previously used during terrorist attacks.</p> <p>On Sunday, after a peaceful daytime protest, police and national guardsmen faced supporters as an 11pm curfew approached, and then advanced firing teargas. Lights illuminating the White House were turned off, which typically only occurs<strong> </strong>when a president dies.</p> <p>Minneapolis had a largely quiet night after the police vigorously enforced an 8pm curfew, shutting all main highways through the city. A lot of side streets were shut off by makeshift barricades erected by residents seeking to protect their homes. The police blocked junctions.</p> <p>Only a small number of people appeared to defy the curfew, including a group of several hundred who maintained a vigil at the place where Floyd was held for nearly nine minutes with police officer Derek Chauvin kneeling on his neck. The street is now a memorial filled with flowers.</p> <p>On Monday the family of George Floyd, 46, released the results of a private autopsy they arranged, which concluded that Floyd died by homicide caused by \u201casphyxiation by sustained force\u201d. They called for the third-degree murder <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/derek-chauvin-police-officer-charged-george-floyd\">charge</a> against former officer Derek Chauvin, who knelt on Floyd\u2019s neck, to be upgraded to a first-degree charge and for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/01/george-floyd-killing-three-officers-charges\">three other officers</a> involved to be arrested for \u201cthe part they played\u201d in the man\u2019s death.</p> <p>Last week preliminary results of the official autopsy, released by the county medical examiner, had found that Floyd\u2019s died because of the \u201ccombined effects of Mr. Floyd\u2019s being restrained by police, underlying health conditions and any potential intoxicants in his system\u201d.</p> <p>Elsewhere, though, violence returned. In Birmingham, Alabama, a Confederate statute was toppled. Protesters hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails in Philadelphia and were hit with teargas in Austin, Texas. Seven Boston police officers were hospitalised.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s predecessor, Barack Obama, offered advice to the protesters.</p> <p>\u201cIf, going forward, we can channel our justifiable anger into peaceful, sustained, and effective action, then this moment can be a real turning point in our nation\u2019s long journey to live up to our highest ideals,\u201d he wrote in a Medium post.</p>",

Particular criticism was levelled at Zuckerberg\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/29/facebook-trump-twitter-social-media-us?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\">personal decision to leave up</a>&nbsp;the Facebook version of a tweet sent by Trump in which the president appeared to encourage police to shoot rioters.&nbsp;By contrast, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/29/twitter-hides-donald-trump-tweet-glorifying-violence\">Twitter hid the message behind a warning</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/28/zuckerberg-facebook-police-online-speech-trump\">Zuckerberg says Facebook won't be 'arbiters of truth' after Trump threat</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Andrew Crow, the head of design for Facebook\u2019s Portal video-phone,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndrewCrow/status/1267313197377187842\">tweeted</a>: \u201cGiving a platform to incite violence and spread disinformation is unacceptable, regardless who you are or if it\u2019s newsworthy. I disagree with Mark\u2019s position and will work to make change happen.\u201d</p> <p>Jason Stirman, a member of the company\u2019s R&amp;D team and the former chief executive of the \u201cmental training\u201d app Lucid, also posted on Twitter,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/stirman/status/1266876587472896000\">saying</a>: \u201cI don\u2019t know what to do, but I know doing nothing is not acceptable. I\u2019m a FB employee that completely disagrees with Mark\u2019s decision to do nothing about Trump\u2019s recent posts, which clearly incite violence. I\u2019m not alone inside of FB. There isn\u2019t a neutral position on racism.\u201d</p> <p>On Friday Zuckerberg said he disagreed with Twitter\u2019s interpretation of Trump\u2019s statement, which included the phrase: \u201cWhen the looting starts, the shooting starts.\u201d Where Twitter had read the statement as incitement&nbsp; \u2013 encouraging police to shoot at protesters \u2013&nbsp;Zuckerberg said he read it as a warning to protesters that the police would be shooting at them. The distinction meant that the post fell on the right side of Facebook\u2019s rules, Zuckerberg said, and would not be removed.</p> <p>\u201cPersonally, I have a visceral negative reaction to this kind of divisive and inflammatory rhetoric,\u201d Zuckerberg added. \u201cI disagree strongly with how the president spoke about this, but I believe people should be able to see this for themselves, because ultimately accountability for those in positions of power can only happen when their speech is scrutinised out in the open.\u201d</p> <p>The Facebook founder\u2019s statement galvanised responses from within his organisation. \u201cMark is wrong, and I will endeavour in the loudest possible way to change his mind,\u201d&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ryanchris/status/1267252760182788096\">said</a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ryanchris/status/1267252760182788096\"> Ryan Freitas</a>, the director of product design for Facebook\u2019s News Feed.

The complaints are mirrored in internal discussions, according to reports in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/technology/twitter-facebook-zuckerberg-trump.html\">the New York Times</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/29/21275044/facebook-trump-tweets-employee-reaction-criticism\">the Verge</a>, where workers accused the company of applying its rules unevenly so as to avoid angering Trump.</p> <p>Late on Sunday night, Zuckerberg committed a $10m donation from Facebook to groups working on racial justice. \u201cIt\u2019s clear Facebook also has more work to do to keep people safe and ensure our systems don\u2019t amplify bias,\u201d he said <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10111969612272851\">in a post to his Facebook page</a>. \u201cI hope that as a country we can come together to understand all of the work that is still ahead and do what it takes to deliver justice \u2013 not just for families and communities that are grieving now, but for everyone who carries the burden of inequality.\u201d</p> <p>More than a dozen Facebook employees had published messages of dissent on Twitter by Monday morning, with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wordstern/status/1267489181632086017\">some</a> saying they were participating in a \u201cvirtual walkout\u201d. The vast majority of Facebook employees are working from home because of the coronavirus outbreak. Dozens of employees requested the day off in order to support protests against police brutality, according to the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/technology/facebook-employee-protest-trump.html\">New York Times</a>.</p> <p>A Facebook spokesperson said the company would not require participants in the \u201cwalkout\u201d to use paid-time off. \u201cWe recognize the pain many of our people are feeling right now, especially our black community,\u201d the spokesperson said in a statement. \u201cWe encourage employees to speak openly when they disagree with leadership.\u201d</p> <h2>Waiting for the oversight board</h2> <p>Some appealed to the company\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/16/facebooks-oversight-board-is-proof-that-it-wants-to-be-regulated-by-itself\">oversight </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/16/facebooks-oversight-board-is-proof-that-it-wants-to-be-regulated-by-itself\">board</a>, a quasi-independent body that Facebook has funded to act as a \u201csupreme court\u201d capable of ruling on difficult questions around content moderation.

Michael McConnell, a Stanford Law professor recently named one of the four co-chairs of the oversight board, is facing widespread criticism from students and faculty after he used the N-word during a Zoom lecture on Wednesday \u2013 two days after the death George Floyd. McConnell stopped the Zoom software from recording before he spoke the word as part of a quotation <a href=\"https://www.stanforddaily.com/2020/05/30/law-professor-criticized-after-reading-racial-slur-in-class/\">attributed</a> to Patrick Henry.</p> <p>The Stanford Black Law Student Association responded with a scathing open letter written as A Guide for White Professors on How to Say \u2018[N-word]\u2019 in Class. After satirizing the timeworn arguments of those who defend use of the slur \u2013 \u201cAfter all, we can\u2019t sanitize <em>history</em>\u201d \u2013 they added: \u201cIf there is one thing black students know, it\u2019s our own history.&nbsp;Ahmaud Arbery is our history. Breonna Taylor is our history. George Floyd is our history. White men refusing to stop saying [N-word] is our history.\u201d</p> <p>In an email reviewed by the Guardian, McConnell said he \u201cmade the pedagogical choice with good will\u201d but understood why students were upset and \u201cwill not use the word again in the future\u201d. McConnell has been contacted for comment.</p> <p>The oversight board provided a statement of support for McConnell from fellow co-chair Jamal Green, a Columbia law school professor who is black. \u201cWhile I might have made a different choice in this instance, I take professor McConnell at his word that he has learned from his experience, as we all must strive to do as educators.\u201d</p> <p>The oversight board also issued a statement saying that the board\u2019s \u201cdiversity is its core strength\u201d. \u201cWe respect the right of the students to speak out about how Michael\u2019s use of this word has impacted them, and appreciate Michael\u2019s explanation of his pedagogic purpose, as well as his commitment not to use the word again.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Do you work for Facebook?

Between now and November, there is a danger the president will attempt to act on the authoritarian undertones of his <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/the-inaugural-address/\" title=\"\">inauguration speech</a> in 2017, when he talked of stamping out \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d in the country\u2019s inner cities.</p> \n<p>Americans must hope that the protesters of recent days do not respond in kind to any such provocations. The Atlanta rapper Killer Mike has urged those marching across the US to take on prosecutors, mayoral offices, police chiefs and deputy chiefs in the voting booth, and to challenge those local structures of judicial and civic power, where systemic racism still thrives. A new generation of politicians, informed by the culture and insights of movements such as Black Lives Matter, will be required to follow through successfully on such a strategy. They may find allies in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIY8L0FLcYA\" title=\"\">police officers</a> such as those in New Jersey who have marched with protesters, or the police chief in Atlanta who condemned the use of Tasers by her officers and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCST6gaqHEk\" title=\"\">went out into the street</a> to listen to demonstrators. But they will need to access the levers of power themselves; for America they cannot come of age soon enough.</p>",

There is so much to say here \u2013 some of it complicated, much of it all too clear.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cOr, you know, you could just go on TV, open up your mouth, and let this shit fall out,\u201d he said before playing a clip of Fox News host and \u201chuman boat shoe\u201d Tucker Carlson.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-nEHkgm_Gk\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/l-nEHkgm_Gk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u201cRioting is the one thing you don\u2019t want,\u201d Carlson said on his show over footage from violent clashes between police and protesters in Minneapolis. Carlson compared the violent protests with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/26/central-park-new-york-white-woman-black-birdwatcher\">now-infamous&nbsp;incident&nbsp;</a>in Central Park last week in which a white woman called the cops on a black birdwatcher, who asked her to leash her dog, and feigned hysteria to gain a swift police response. \u201cUgly opinions, police brutality, officious birdwatchers, rude and entitled ladies walking their dogs in big-city parks \u2013 all of that is bad. But none of it is nearly as bad as what you just saw,\u201d Carlson said.</p> <p>\u201cOK, first: fuck you, Tucker,\u201d Oliver responded. \u201cThat\u2019s just a general point. Second, saying \u2018officious birdwatcher\u2019 is deeply offensive \u2013 because you\u2019re either trying to both-sides that Central Park incident or insulting fans of this show, who proudly call themselves \u2018officious birdwatchers\u2019. I am the \u2018officious bird\u2019; they are the \u2018watchers.\u2019 Keep their name out of your mouth.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cPeople like Tucker love to venerate order at moments like this, and that\u2019s easy to do when order in its current form is designed to benefit and protect you,\u201d Oliver continued. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard to overstate how clearly we\u2019ve been reminded lately of the hostility of our existing order toward black people who\u2019ve been killed by police on the street [George Floyd], killed by police in their own home [emergency room technician Breonna Taylor, who was&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/breonna-taylor-louisville-police-shooting-kentucky\">killed&nbsp;by police</a> on 13 March in Louisville], \u201ckilled by wannabe police in the street [Ahmaud Arbery, who was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/06/ahmaud-arbery-shooting-georgia\">shot and&nbsp;killed&nbsp;</a>while jogging in February by two white men in Georgia], and threatened with state violence while literally birding [Christian Cooper, the birdwatcher in Central Park]. \u201cCollectively, that has just got to be some brutality bingo right there.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/may/18/john-oliver-sports-coronavirus-return\">'It's just not possible right now': John Oliver on bringing back sports safely</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cAnd when \u2018order\u2019 results in you lying face-down on a lawn while your grandma stands between you and the police who have pulled their guns on you after you allegedly just rolled a stop sign,\u201d he continued, in reference to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbs7.com/content/news/Arrest-affidavit-details-controversial-incident-between-black-man-and-Midland-police-570679501.html\">Tye Anders</a>, a 21-year-old Texan arrested in a terrifying ordeal with police in May. \u201cI can see why being lectured on the importance of \u2018order\u2019 at the expense of all else is just not what you want to fucking hear right now!\u201d</p> <p>And the president, Oliver noted, is baiting \u2013 the host pointed to his tweet from the weekend (which Twitter sanctioned for \u201cglorifying violence\u201d) in which he called the protesters \u201cthugs\u201d and said \u201cwhen the looting starts, the shooting starts.\u201d \u201cWhen a man like Donald Trump uses the word \u2018thugs\u2019, you know exactly what it\u2019s code for,\u201d said Oliver. \u201c\u2018When the looting starts, the shooting starts,\u2019 is actually a quote from a notoriously racist 1960s Miami police chief. And it is truly astounding how Donald Trump has managed to live 74 years with a remedial understanding of spelling, grammar, geography, science, civics nutrition and child development, and yet he\u2019s the fucking Library of Alexandria when it comes to racist maxims of the 20th century.\u201d</p> <p>Oliver\u2019s main segment concerned the less explosive but extremely important issue of mail-in voting \u2013 the same issue which garnered Trump\u2019s other Twitter censure last week, for his erroneous claim that it\u2019s \u201csubstantially fraudulent\u201d. Mail-in voting is actually common in many states with both Republican and Democratic-leaning governments, \u201cand if this pandemic continues into the fall, as it most certainly will, many voters will want to do exactly that\u201d, said Oliver. \u201cBecause think about it: holding an in-person election during a pandemic is an absolute nightmare.</p> <p>\u201cThe question isn\u2019t \u2018should we have voting by mail\u2019 at all, because we already do,\u201d Oliver explained. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018how hard should we make it?\u2019\u201d That question depends on where you live \u2013 some states have significant restrictions on mail-in voting, such as Alabama, which requires mail-in ballots to include a photocopy of one\u2019s state ID and a notary signed by two witnesses. Voter fraud is thus a crime that is \u201cdifficult, high-risk and low reward\u201d, said Oliver. \u201cIt\u2019s as if at the end of Ocean\u2019s Eight, we learned that Sandra Bullock had gone to all the trouble of breaking into the Met Gala to steal a map of state\u2019s quarters.\u201d</p> <p>And while advocates argue that it will reduce obstacles to civic participation, \u201cthat in and of itself may be why it\u2019s become so controversial\u201d, Oliver said. \u201cConservative opponents often speculate that any increased participation would benefit Democrats despite the fact that researchers have consistently found that hasn\u2019t obviously helped one party or the other.\u201d</p> <p>The attempts to discredit mail-in voting during a pandemic is why \u201cnow is absolutely the time to talk about this,\u201d Oliver concluded. \u201cYou cannot prepare for an election the same way you update your computer\u2019s software, by just putting it off for months on end and secretly hoping that maybe you\u2019ll be dead before you actually have to deal with it. We need to get this right, now.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Here we go again. Another black person killed by the US police. Another wave of multiracial resistance. Another cycle of race talk on the corporate media.

It's defunding. Here's why  | Alex S Vitale</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The increasing militarization of US society is inseparable from its imperial policies (211 deployments of US armed forces in 67 countries since 1945). The militaristic response to the killing of Floyd tells a story&nbsp;of oversized police presence, unprovoked assaults and excessive force. Ironically, the misleading debate over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/31/george-floyd-protesters-condemn-opportunistic-looting-violence\">rioters v protesters</a> and outside agitators v legitimate local citizens turns attention away from&nbsp;how heavy law enforcement presence fuels disrespect for the police. The stark contrast of the police response to rightwing provocateurs who show up inside and outside state capitols with guns and loaded ammunition looms large.</p> <p>I recall my own experience of protesting in Charlottesville, Virginia, against hundreds of masked, armed Nazis with live ammunition in which the police stepped back and remained still and silent as we were mercilessly attacked. Without the intervention and protection of antifa, some of us would have died. Sister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/01/heather-heyers-mother-on-hate-in-the-us-were-not-going-to-hug-it-out-but-we-can-listen-to-each-other\">Heather Heyer</a> did die. I believe the attack on any innocent person is wrong, but the focus on the protesters\u2019 assaults on persons or property takes our attention away from the police killing of hundreds of black, poor and working-class people.</p> <p>It also obscures the role of the repressive apparatus in preserving an order so unjust and cruel. The rule of big money, class and gender hierarchies and global militarism must be highlighted in our profound concern with anti-black police murder and brutality.</p> <p>The four catastrophes Martin Luther King Jr warned us about \u2013&nbsp;militarism (in Asia, Africa and the Middle East), poverty (at record levels), materialism (with narcissistic addictions to money, fame and spectacle) and racism (against black and indigenous people, Muslims, Jews and non-white immigrants) \u2013&nbsp;have laid bare the organised hatred, greed and corruption in the country. The killing machine of the US military here and abroad has lost its authority. The profit-driven capitalist economy has lost its glow. And the glitz of the market-driven culture (including media and education) are more and more hollow.&nbsp;</p> <p>The fundamental question at this moment is: can this failed social experiment be reformed? The political duopoly of an escalating neofascist Donald Trump-led Republican party and a fatigued Joe Biden-led neoliberal Democratic party \u2013&nbsp;in no way equivalent, yet both beholden to Wall Street and the Pentagon \u2013&nbsp;are symptoms of a decadent leadership class. The weakness of the labor movement and the present difficulty of the radical left to unite around a nonviolent revolutionary project of democratic sharing and redistribution of power, wealth and respect are signs of a society unable to regenerate the best of its past and present.&nbsp;Any society that refuses to eliminate or attenuate dilapidated housing, decrepit school systems, mass incarceration, massive unemployment and underemployment, inadequate healthcare and its violations of rights and liberties is undesirable and unsustainable.</p> <p>Yet the magnificent moral courage and spiritual sensitivity of the multiracial response to the police killing of George Floyd that now spills over into a political resistance to the legalized looting of Wall Street greed, the plundering of the planet and the degradation of women and LGBTQ+ peoples means we are still fighting regardless of the odds.&nbsp;</p> <p>If radical democracy dies in America, let it be said of us that we gave our all-and-all as the boots of American fascism tried to crush our necks.&nbsp;</p> <ul> <li><p>Cornel West is an American philosopher, author, critic, actor, civil rights activist and leading member of Democratic Socialists of America</p></li> </ul>",

In the fourth year, the fates demanded payback.</p> <p>Not even Trump\u2019s harshest critics can blame him for a virus believed to have come from a market in the Chinese city of Wuhan, nor for an attendant economic collapse, nor for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/13/us-slavery-400-years-virginia-point-comfort\">four centuries of slavery,</a> segregation, police brutality and racial injustice.</p> <p>But they can, and do, point to how he made a bad situation so much worse. The story of Trump\u2019s presidency was arguably always leading to this moment, with its toxic mix of weak moral leadership, racial divisiveness, crass and vulgar rhetoric and an erosion of norms, institutions and trust in traditional information sources. Taken together, these ingredients created a tinderbox poised to explode when crises came.</p> <p>Trump, they say, was uniquely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/31/george-floyd-donald-trump-protests-violence-looting\">ill-qualified for this moment.</a> He tried to wish away the threat of the coronavirus and failed to prepare, then paid no heed to how communities of colour bore the brunt of its health and economic consequences.

He\u2019s used to these dog whistles and, instead of trying to uproot division and seeing that the citizens are actually in pain and hurting, he doesn\u2019t have the capacity to address that.

Perhaps it tightened. At the start of this re-election year, feeling emboldened by his acquittal in a Senate impeachment trial and a robust economy, Trump was confident of his re-election chances.</p> <p>Now, with health, economic and social crises feeding off each other, polls show him trailing rival Joe Biden. But the situation remains volatile and unpredictable. The president has sought to scapegoat anti-fascist protesters, and there would be little surprise if he returned to Nixonian law-and-order rhetoric to rally Republicans and lay a trap for Democrats, portraying them as \u201csoft on crime\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"18385303b725c840c6044fdfdfc7904d4a1d02cb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/18385303b725c840c6044fdfdfc7904d4a1d02cb/0_468_7070_4245/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Police fire at protesters in Denver.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police fire at protesters in Denver.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tyler Tomasello/ZUMA Wire/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cGet tough Democrat Mayors and Governors,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1267187902192193538?s=20\">Trump tweeted on Sunday,</a> even as protesters gathered outside the White House for the third straight day. \u201cThese people are ANARCHISTS.

In a March interview, he dismissed Democratic efforts in Congress to make it easier to vote by mail during the Covid-19 pandemic, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/30/trump-republican-party-voting-reform-coronavirus\">saying</a>: \u201cIf you\u2019d ever agreed to it, you\u2019d never have a Republican elected in this country again.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>President Trump is using his bully platform to try to discourage people from voting and to try to stop people from voting by mail</p> <footer> <cite>Domingo Garcia</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Many people are used to brushing off Trump\u2019s rhetoric about voter fraud, said Cliff Albright, a co-founder of the Black Voters Matter. But Albright said Trump\u2019s comments were worrisome in a larger context of aggressive Republican efforts to police voting.</p> <p>In Georgia, Albright noted, Brad Raffensperger, the secretary of state, has encouraged absentee voting but also created an \u201c<a href=\"https://sos.ga.gov/index.php/elections/secretary_of_state_brad_raffensperger_appoints_absentee_ballot_fraud_task_force_\">absentee ballot fraud taskforce</a>\u201d stacked with prosecutors to monitor mail-in voting. In Texas, which severely restricts absentee voting, Ken Paxton, the attorney general, <a href=\"https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/sites/default/files/images/admin/2020/Press/4.14.20%20Letter%20to%20Rep.%20Klick.pdf\">warned</a> of possible \u201ccriminal sanctions\u201d for anyone who advised a voter they could use Covid-19 as the basis for requesting a mail-in ballot.</p> <p>\u201cThat one-two punch is what makes it very intimidating,\u201d Albright said. \u201cIt does influence people and does intimidate people and makes some folks feel like this is not something they want to engage in.\u201d</p> <p>The Republican National Committee is also seeking to recruit up to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/18/us/Voting-republicans-trump.html\">50,000 volunteers</a> to monitor voting this fall, the first time in nearly three decades when they won\u2019t be under a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/01/09/576858203/decades-old-consent-decree-lifted-against-rncs-ballot-security-measures\">federal court order</a> barring them from engaging in poll-watching activity.&nbsp;</p> <p>There is growing alarm that Trump\u2019s rhetoric will lay the groundwork to contest the results of the presidential election once the ballots are counted. Unlike past elections, America is unlikely to know the winner of the presidential race on election night as officials count ballots coming in (some states allow ballots to be counted as long as they are postmarked by election day).</p> <p>The candidate who appears to be ahead on election day may ultimately end up losing as more ballots are counted. And a candidate could use the gap in getting official results to claim widespread fraud, said Nathaniel Persily, a law professor at Stanford University who closely studies elections.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s where the disinformation and the polarizing rhetoric and questioning of the legitimacy of elections could come in. You say there\u2019s something fishy with the mail ballots if they are not reflective of the percentage that has not been revealed up to that point.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Republicans offered a preview of this in 2018, when they <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/paul-ryan-california-elections_n_5c004a8ae4b027f1097be7a7\">suggested there was something amiss</a> as Democrats in California congressional races picked up votes as the state continued to count mail-in ballots after election day. In Florida, Trump and Rick Scott, then the state\u2019s governor, <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/rick-scott-recount-law-enforcement-fraud_n_5be4fb42e4b0e8438895dc54\">baselessly accused</a> election officials of fraud as they counted ballots in a US Senate race Scott was running in.&nbsp;</p> <p>To shore up confidence in the results of the election, a consortium of experts recommended last month that states and media organizations make it clear they expect a delay in reporting official results well ahead of election night.</p> <p>Accepting the legitimate transfer of power is crucial to the foundation of American democracy. If there isn\u2019t a belief the election is fair, that pillar is gone, Garcia said.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m concerned that we could have a constitutional crisis if we have the same president saying that the election was somehow tainted because people voted by mail,\u201d Garcia said. \u201cThat could lead to a possible huge crisis in America\u2019s democracy.\u201d&nbsp;</p>",
  "<p>At a ceremony in the White House Rose Garden last week, a maskless Donald Trump appealed directly to a constituency that could determine his political fate in November\u2019s election: America\u2019s seniors.&nbsp;</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/joe-biden-donald-trump-coronavirus-death-toll\">Biden sets solemn tone as Trump waits 15 hours to mark Covid-19 milestone</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThis is a big day for seniors,\u201d Trump declared, unveiling a plan to lower the cost of insulin for many Medicare recipients. He touted the achievement as a \u201cbreakthrough\u201d and a preview of what he could deliver in a second term.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cSleepy Joe can\u2019t do this,\u201d Trump said, lacing into his Democratic rival Joe Biden. He added, not too subtly: \u201cI hope the seniors are going to remember it.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Older voters, America\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.pewsocialtrends.org/essay/an-early-look-at-the-2020-electorate/\">largest and most reliable</a> voting bloc, have for years punched above their political weight. Over the past two decades, Republicans maintained an advantage with this constituency, and in 2016 their outsized political influence in key swing states such as Michigan and Wisconsin were essential to Trump\u2019s electoral victory.&nbsp;But there are signs that may be changing.</p> <p>The White House event, staged during the last week of what Trump designated \u201cOlder Americans Month\u201d, came as a string of national and battleground state polls show the president\u2019s support declining with older voters, amid his erratic handling of the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>These voters are the most vulnerable to Covid-19, which has already claimed the lives of more than 100,000 Americans. A Quinnipiac University <a href=\"https://poll.qu.edu/national/release-detail?ReleaseID=3661\">poll</a> released last week shows Biden leading Trump by 10 points among voters 65 and older.&nbsp;</p> <p>The president\u2019s troubles with older voters began before the coronavirus spread to the US. But political strategists in both parties say the shortcomings of his response to the virus has only deepened the problem.</p> <p>\u201cThe biggest factor right now is that older Americans are disproportionately impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic,\u201d said Michael Steele, a Republican political strategist. \u201cTheir friends are dying and they can\u2019t even go to the funerals.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>In recent weeks, Trump has turned his attention almost entirely from controlling the public health outbreak to reopening the country and restoring the economy. But polling suggests seniors remain deeply concerned about their health, and the potential for a second coronavirus outbreak in the fall. They are also among the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/may-5-10-2020-washington-post-university-of-maryland-poll/722b3348-4f59-4b35-9fa0-2f9eb4ac76c0/?itid=lk_inline_manual_1\">most supportive of and the likeliest to abide by</a> precautionary public health measures to control the spread of the virus.&nbsp;</p> <p><a href=\"https://navigatorresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Older-Americans-Deep-Dive-Final.pdf\">A new analysis by Navigator Research</a>, a progressive polling firm tracking public opinion on Covid-19, found older Americans losing faith in Trump\u2019s handling of the outbreak, increasingly characterizing his performance as \u201cself-absorbed\u201d and neither \u201cserious\u201d nor \u201cpresidential\u201d.</p> <p>In March, voters 55 and older approved of Trump\u2019s response to the pandemic by 17 points, according to the polling memo shared first with the Guardian. Now, these voters narrowly disapprove of his response, a 19-point erosion in just two months.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cFor senior voters, there\u2019s this really vivid contrast between a steady leader and an erratic leader, a leader who listens to experts to one who thinks he knows it all,\u201d said Celinda Lake, a veteran Democratic pollster.</p> <p>Lake said senior women are particularly uneasy with Trump\u2019s behavior, especially his promotion of unproven medical treatments and his aggressive push to reopen the economy despite warnings from public health experts.</p> <p>\u201cWhat some men dismissed as just \u2018Trump being Trump,\u2019 senior women really thought was divisive, disrespectful, erratic, and they value all three of those qualities,\u201d Lake said. \u201cIn the end, it\u2019s primarily senior women who are moving away from him.\u201d</p> <p>That erosion was reflected in the recent Quinnipiac poll, which found that women support Biden by 22 points over Trump. By contrast, Trump leads Biden by 11 points among men over 65.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a69208379f78ee1874754b62d745290a930be6bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a69208379f78ee1874754b62d745290a930be6bf/0_171_5161_3098/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Biden and Jill Biden arrive to lay a wreath at the Delaware Memorial Bridge Veterans Memorial Park.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Biden and Jill Biden arrive to lay a wreath at the Delaware Memorial Bridge Veterans Memorial Park.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick Semansky/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lake said Biden probably does not have to win older voters to deny Trump a second term. Given how narrowly Trump won in 2016, a marginal dent in his support there could be enough to tilt some battleground states in Biden\u2019s favor.</p> <p>Michael Gwin, a spokesman for the Biden campaign, said: \u201cOlder Americans know that Vice-President Biden will provide the strong and compassionate leadership our country needs in a moment of crisis like this, and they know that Biden will always fight to protect the entitlements they\u2019ve spent their entire lives working towards.\u201d</p> <p>Allies and aides to Trump have publicly <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DavidJUrban/status/1253344448953683970?s=20\">downplayed</a> concerns about his deficit with seniors. But the White House has also ramped up efforts to showcase how the administration is benefiting seniors.&nbsp;And in May, Vice-President Mike Pence delivered personal protective equipment to a nursing home in Orlando treating coronavirus cases.</p> <p>\u201cJust like every American, senior citizens saw what President Trump achieved for America during his first three years in office and they see the president leading the nation during the coronavirus response,\u201d said Sarah Matthews, a spokeswoman for the Trump campaign. </p> <p>Despite the uncertainty enveloping 2020, Nancy LeaMond, the executive vice-president and chief advocacy and engagement officer of the non-partisan AARP, expects older voters will once again play a decisive role in the presidential election.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re going to find a way to vote, even if they\u2019re afraid in the current pandemic,\u201d she said during an online briefing last week.</p> <p>LeaMond emphasized that seniors are \u201cnot a monolith\u201d, nor are they firmly aligned with a political party, noting that while older voters were essential to Trump\u2019s political success, they helped Democrats take control of the House in 2018.</p> <p>On the policy front, protecting entitlement programs like social security and Medicare were always priorities for older voters, and LeaMond said they are probably even more so amid the pandemic.&nbsp;</p> <p>As a candidate, Trump was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/05/11/us/politics/where-trump-breaks-with-the-republican-party.html\">emphatic</a> in his support for such programs, breaking with traditional Republican orthodoxy. But as president, Trump has at <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/2/10/21131316/trump-2021-budget-entitlement-cuts\">various times </a>suggested openness to spending cuts \u2013&nbsp;comments the Biden campaign intends to highlight. The Trump campaign is, in turn, attempting to weaponize Biden\u2019s past comments on social security dating back to 1979.&nbsp;</p> <p>Even before the coronavirus upended the presidential election, Biden\u2019s strength with his agemates was a threat to Trump.&nbsp;During the primary, Biden&nbsp;won voters over 65 in every state contest except <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/entrance-and-exit-polls/vermont/democratic\">Vermont</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/entrance-and-exit-polls/new-hampshire/democratic\">New Hampshire</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p>Democrats say older voters, who helped Biden secure the party\u2019s nomination, view him as an empathetic leader shaped by personal tragedy, and are drawn to his moderate politics and his emphasis on shared American values.</p> <p>But Trump, 73, has also sought to cast his 77-year-old opponent as \u201cSleepy Joe\u201d, a doddering older man unfit for the presidency. As part of a recent advertising blitz, Trump\u2019s re-election campaign mocked Biden as \u201cold and out of&nbsp;it\u201d and \u201cgeriatric\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <p>Biden\u2019s campaign believes this strategy could backfire. Some of Trump\u2019s top aides have <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-campaign-divided-over-how-to-attack-biden-amid-worries-over-troubling-poll-numbers/2020/05/02/2dcf8740-8bf0-11ea-8ac1-bfb250876b7a_story.html\">reportedly</a> warned allies that their aggressive attacks on Biden\u2019s mental fitness could further harm Trump\u2019s standing among senior citizens.&nbsp;</p> <p>In Florida, a state with a significant retiree population, Biden has for months maintained an edge with the state\u2019s older voters, an electorate that now includes the president.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s electoral success likely depends on winning Florida, where he defeated Hillary Clinton by just over 1 percentage point in 2016. According to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/election/2016/results/exit-polls/florida/president\">exit polls</a>, he carried voters 65 and older in the state by a 17-point margin.</p> <p>Democrats say many voters in the state are souring on the president. The coronavirus has hit elderly Floridians hard: more than <a href=\"https://www.tampabay.com/news/health/2020/05/17/in-florida-83-percent-of-coronavirus-deaths-are-people-65-and-older/\">80%</a> of those who have died from coronavirus were older than 65, and more than 40% of them can be traced to long-term care facilities.</p> <p>\u201cSeniors have eyes and ears. They see and hear exactly what Donald Trump has done and are going to be holding him accountable,\u201d said Terrie Rizzo, chair of the Florida Democratic party. \u201cTrump has failed us as seniors and it is now our turn.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>The Biden campaign is attempting to solidify this advantage, which pollsters say could fade as the dynamics of the virus shift. Last week, surrogates hosted a series of events in battleground states with seniors while Biden makes frequent appearances on local television stations, whose audience skew older.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dfc2625d2bee9779537e07a19c2905d4af4b17ce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dfc2625d2bee9779537e07a19c2905d4af4b17ce/0_186_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump takes questions from reporters during an event on protecting seniors with diabetes in the Rose Garden of the White House on 26 May.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump takes questions from reporters during an event on protecting seniors with diabetes at the White House on Tuesday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Campaign organizers, along with state party officials, have also been conducting \u201cwellness checks\u201d on older voters during the pandemic.

For the veterans of those conflicts, and the many more whose lives were shaped by them, the scale of loss in such a short period of time is hard to grasp, he said, especially as more is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/21/us-social-distancing-lives-lost-coronavirus-lockdown-study\">revealed</a> about what could have been done to save American lives.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just a huge trauma,\u201d he said. \u201cThe more people learn, the more and more angry and disappointed they are.\u201d</p>",

There is broad consensus among most public health experts worldwide that too swiftly ending lockdowns risks a potentially devastating second wave of infections in a pandemic that has already cost more than 100,000 American lives.</p> <p>But the Tea Party Patriots have spearheaded a drive, in radio and TV interviews, to mobilize doctors urging states to move faster. It is now attracting broader financial support from rightwing donors and groups in the shape of the SOC. Doctors in the group have also pushed unscientific theories about the pandemic in ways that have sparked anger and criticism.</p> <p>The Tea Party leader Jenny Beth Martin said the group has about 800 members and its mission is to \u201ceducate the American public about the unintended side-effects\u201d of the shutdown. Martin said 800 doctors signed a letter in May to Donald Trump which called the lockdowns a \u201cmass casualty\u201d event causing depression and other ills and urged Trump to end the \u201cnational shutdown\u201d. A copy of the letter is going this week to governors nationwide.</p> <p>The coalition\u2019s key groups are dark money non-profits that historically have been funded by a mix of wealthy donors, corporations and conservative foundations.

  "<p>As the United States responds to the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s (CCP) brazen crackdown on Hong Kong, it is hard to imagine a US president with less credibility than Donald Trump - who just this week <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1266231100780744704\">threatened</a> violence against US citizens protesting police brutality and racism - to respond effectively to the CCP\u2019s dangerous infringement on the rights of the people of Hong Kong.</p> <p>The rising tensions over Hong Kong are a window into the future of the US-China relationship \u2013 the challenges posed by the Chinese Communist party (CCP), the stakes at play, and how dangerous it is when the United States lacks an effective approach.&nbsp;</p> <p>After the \u201chandover\u201d in 1997, the people of Hong Kong were promised at least 50 years of self-rule and a democratic system of government; the CCP has encroached on Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy ever since. Major protests \u2013 including in 2014 and last year \u2013 have been sparked not only by acts of repression by the CCP, but also more recently by the fear that time is running out for Hong Kong.&nbsp;</p> <p>A new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/china-vote-npc-national-security-laws-hong-kong-us-protest\">law</a> approved by the Chinese mainland\u2019s national people\u2019s congress makes those fears more real than ever. The CCP argues that the inability of the Hong Kong government to deal with protests means that Beijing must step in, a move that violates the promise of separate political systems. The new law authorizes arrests for <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-52762291\">vague</a> transgressions such as \u201ctreason\u201d, \u201csedition\u201d and \u201csubversion\u201d, raising fears that anyone deemed an opponent of the CCP could be arrested. The law also authorizes the CCP\u2019s security services to operate openly in Hong Kong, formally extending the power of the Chinese security state to Hong Kong.&nbsp;</p> <p>The CCP views the protests in Hong Kong as a direct threat to the CCP\u2019s autocratic system, and influencing the CCP on this is difficult. But the CCP watches closely for the reactions of the rest of the world, in particular the US. Trump has generally made it clear that he couldn\u2019t care less what happens in Hong Kong. At the height of the protests last year, Trump <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/03/politics/trump-biden-call-xi-secure-server/index.html\">reportedly</a> told the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, that he would stay quiet about Hong Kong in order to facilitate a trade deal. In public remarks Trump has <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-08-02/trump-calls-hong-kong-protests-riots-adopting-china-rhetoric\">called</a> the protests \u201criots\u201d and said they are China\u2019s business to handle.&nbsp;</p> <p>The US Congress, however, responded to last year\u2019s events by passing the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/1838/text\">Act</a>, which Trump was forced to sign. That law requires the US secretary of state to certify every year that Hong Kong remains autonomous, which is a precondition for the US to continue its preferential economic relationship with Hong Kong. On Wednesday, in response to the CCP\u2019s latest move, the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/prc-national-peoples-congress-proposal-on-hong-kong-national-security-legislation/\">notified</a> Congress that Hong Kong was not autonomous from the mainland.&nbsp;</p> <p>Pompeo\u2019s certification gives the president and secretary of state the ability to impose consequences ranging from sanctions to a complete change in the US-Hong Kong economic relationship. The stakes couldn\u2019t be higher: Hong Kong\u2019s precarious position as a relatively free, democratic society and a global financial hub are dependent on its special treatment by the United States and the international community. If those relationships change, then Hong Kong, US-China relations and the global financial system will change too.&nbsp;</p> <p>Threatening to change the US relationship with Hong Kong could, conceivably, deter the CCP from further crackdowns, because the CCP benefits financially from Hong Kong\u2019s unique economic status. But if the US upends Hong Kong\u2019s special status, it could help seal the fate of the people of Hong Kong as just another part of the CCP\u2019s autocratic domain. The US cannot do that.&nbsp;</p> <p>The CCP\u2019s actions are not taking place in a vacuum \u2013 they are illustrative of the broader challenges the CCP poses to the world, and the dilemmas it presents for the US. As tensions rise, and the CCP uses the cover of the global pandemic to aggressively pursue territorial claims from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/27/china-and-india-move-troops-as-border-tensions-escalate\">India</a> to the South China <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/International-relations/New-South-China-Sea-tensions-rattle-Manila-and-Hanoi-amid-pandemic\">Sea</a>, the range of threats is only growing.&nbsp;</p> <p>Trump\u2019s erratic policies have only made matters worse. His trade war hurts the American economy. His lack of interest in human rights has removed potential deterrents against the CCP\u2019s campaign of ethnic cleansing in Xinjiang and repression in Hong Kong. Trump\u2019s undermining of US alliances and withdrawal from leadership in international organizations has ceded the global playing field to China. The list goes on.&nbsp;</p> <p>As the US develops strategies to confront the challenges posed by the CCP, we will need to embrace policy approaches that Trump has abandoned. That will mean standing up for values, investing in the American economy, working with allies, and strengthening international institutions.&nbsp;</p> <p>When it comes to standing up for Hong Kong today, the US must respond to the passage of the new law with immediate diplomatic pressure. It also needs to send clear public and private <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/security/reports/2019/09/16/474577/support-democracy-human-rights-asia/\">signals</a> about the measures that the US will take if Beijing follows through with a crackdown on Hong Kong \u2013&nbsp;including targeted sanctions against the officials, security services and companies involved</p> <p>To bring international pressure against the CCP, the US must also put Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy on the agenda of international organizations from the United Nations to the G7.&nbsp;</p> <p>The US must closely coordinate with its allies, in particular the United Kingdom, which has a special role to play as the signatory to the Sino-British Joint Declaration that outlined the terms of Hong Kong\u2019s handover to China. The US has taken a first step in this direction with a joint US-UK-Canada-Australia <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CBCAlerts/status/1265974905268469763\">statement</a> condemning the CCP\u2019s move.&nbsp;</p> <p>The situation also requires consulting with and following the lead of those on the ground in Hong Kong fighting for their rights. The US must ensure that its actions do everything possible to help the people of Hong Kong rather than sacrificing Hong Kong to make a larger point about the CCP.&nbsp;</p> <p>Perhaps most importantly, effectively standing up for values abroad requires upholding universal values at home. The Trump administration\u2019s endless assaults on America\u2019s democratic institutions - of which Trump\u2019s threat of violence against Americans is just the most recent shocking illustration - erodes America\u2019s ability to credibly pressure the CCP over its own human rights abuses.</p> <p>Right now, the people of Hong Kong and the US and people across the world need strong, principled American leadership to deal with the challenges posed by the CCP. Three and a half years of Trump\u2019s counterproductive policies \u2013 which the CCP have taken advantage of \u2013 have only made that US leadership more necessary than ever.</p>",

The UK, Ireland, France, Portugal, Italy and Slovakia will all exit coal before 2025. Spain produced 70% less coal-powered energy in 2019 and <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-22/spain-nears-life-without-coal-sooner-than-anyone-thought\">is predicted to achieve full </a>closure by 2027. But Germany wants to keep production going well into the 2030s and some mines are expanding. Witt cites <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-13/germany-s-farewell-to-coal-complicated-by-new-uniper-plant\">the new Datteln IV coal plant</a> that Germany will add to the grid this summer, a move protesters call <a href=\"https://www.waz.de/staedte/witten/witten-protest-gegen-steinkohlekraftwerk-datteln-4-id229167698.html\">\u201cclimate policy madness\u201d</a>.</p> \n<p>The coal lobby, and many politicians, argue that Germany still needs lignite because it is already committed to shuttering nuclear power plants by 2022. And <a href=\"https://www.deutschlandfunk.de/erneuerbare-energien-experten-kritisieren-zu-geringes-tempo.769.de.html?dram:article_id=450779\">renewables are being built at </a>a pace too slow to meet the country\u2019s current energy needs.</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>The energy to sustain the minimum level in the power grid needs to come from somewhere, and that is coal for the time being <em>Georg Ortmann</em></p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>\u201cThe energy to sustain the minimum level in the power grid needs to come from somewhere, and that is coal for the time being,\u201d says Ortmann, the miner.</p> \n<p>He points to the dark layer at the bottom of the pit. Here, plants and trees that grew on this spot 17m years ago are exposed by the machines, now mostly in the form of black coal. Some of the wood is still visible, but once laid bare it will decompose quickly in the fresh air.</p> \n<p>The coal companies\u2019 logic is that since the damage to the environment has already been done, existing mines should be exploited to the maximum. But that can mean expanding brown coalfields by digging them out from underneath <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/30/human-rights-mining-german-villagers-take-on-coal-giant-rwe\">existing villages</a>. </p> \n<h2><strong>Bulldozing a village </strong></h2> \n<p>One of those villages is M\u00fchlrose. LEAG, the Czech-owned coal firm that runs Boxberg, wants to add the lignite-rich land beneath the village to its current mine. So M\u00fchlrose will be razed and locals rehoused in the nearby town of Schleife. Even the graves in the cemetery will be moved.</p> \n<p>Of the village\u2019s original 600 inhabitants, only 200 remain. But people\u2019s lives should not be uprooted for a dying industry, Rinnert says.</p> \n<p>Yet some in M\u00fchlrose say they are tired of living next door to a coalmine and are ready to move. \u201cWe\u2019ve suffered here for years,\u201d says Reinhild Martin. The 69-year-old owns a restaurant in the village, an establishment opened by her grandfather.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"47350b942180d0b15b1bd4209d8711a9ab5872fc\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47350b942180d0b15b1bd4209d8711a9ab5872fc/0_400_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Reinhild Martin, the owner of Zur Erholung restaurant in M\u00fchlrose, a village threatened by excavation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Reinhild Martin, the owner of Zur Erholung restaurant in M\u00fchlrose, a village threatened by excavation</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefanie Loos</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Most villagers have mixed feelings about their proximity to the mine. Nearly everyone was employed by the coal company. Men in the mines, women in the cafeterias. At the same time, the noise and pollution were almost unbearable.</p> \n<p>Thick layers of brown or grey coal dust would be carried by the wind, lodging on window panes and clinging to the laundry on the line, Martin remembers. Over the years, she claims, M\u00fchlrose people died of lung cancer, but the matter was never officially investigated.</p> \n<p>Although it pains her to leave, Martin looks forward to a fresh start with the compensation. </p> \n<p>\u201cOnce they start ripping down the houses, I don\u2019t want to return to the village. Those that left before and that came back to see the devastation never really recovered from the sight,\u201d she says. </p> \n<p>In communist East Germany, forced displacement was part of everyday life in mining regions. An estimated 30,000 people in the Lusatia region were relocated and more than 130 villages destroyed.</p> \n<p>Next to the human cost the environmental impact is a lasting one, too. Germany\u2019s lignite mines have destroyed 175,000 hectares of <a href=\"https://www.bund.net/fileadmin/user_upload_bund/_migrated/publications/150330_bund_broschuere_zukunft_statt_braunkohle.pdf\">the country\u2019s landscape</a>. Soil here is considered dead since nothing grows in it afterwards. And once the mine shuts and the pumps regulating the water levels are turned off, the ground becomes waterlogged.</p> \n<p>Rinnert says recultivating disused pits for tourism and other uses has had mixed success and is not sustainably planned. \u201cThe coal companies are making an effort now, but who will pay once their operations stop and their money runs out?\u201d </p> \n<p>Some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/sep/17/lusatian-lake-district-project-east-germany\">old mines</a> have been flooded to <a href=\"https://www.leag.de/de/geschaeftsfelder/bergbau/cottbuser-ostsee/\">create artificial lakes</a>, but managing the water quality is a long-term project. \u201cRight now no guarantees exist that the companies will continue to care for the lakes.

  "<p>Donald Trump was taken to the secure White House bunker, usually reserved for times of war or terrorist attacks, in the midst of noisy protests on Friday about the killing of George Floyd by police, and sporadic clashes close to the presidential complex\u2019s perimeter.</p> <p>According to several accounts by unnamed officials, Trump spent nearly an hour sequestered in the austere suite of hardened underground rooms designed for use in grave emergencies, and in which the then vice-president, Dick Cheney, took shelter during the 9/11 attacks.</p> <p>The decision to move the president to the bunker was attributed to US Secret Service officers tasked with protecting him. It was taken as chants from protesters in nearby Lafayette Park could be heard in the White House, and Secret Service and DC and park police were required to push back demonstrators from barriers close to the White House, some of whom were throwing stones and water bottles.</p> <p>The decision to take Trump to the bunker, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/31/us/politics/trump-protests-george-floyd.html\">first reported in the New York Times</a>, preceded the turning off of external lights at the White House during further protests on Sunday, and has inevitably reinforced the sense of a president under siege.</p> <p>Largely unheard from except for the stream of predictably accusatory and inflammatory tweets, Trump did, however, condemn Floyd\u2019s killing in a <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-kennedy-space-center/\">speech marking the SpaceX launch in Florida</a> on Saturday.</p> <p>The White House and Secret Service remarked that they did not comment on security protocols and decisions or the means and methods of protective operations. The bunker is hardened to withstand the force of a passenger jet crashing into the White House.</p> <p>The incident provoked a stream of derisive comments on social media, comparing Trump unfavourably both to the presumptive Democratic candidate, Joe Biden, who visited protesters and to the cowardly lion from the Wizard of Oz. The hashtag \u201c#bunkerboy\u201d became a trending term on Twitter.</p> <p>Greg Sargent, who writes the Plum Line blog for the Washington Post, wrote: \u201cPresident of the United States cowering in fear of delivering a national address while instead issuing deranged tweets from his underground bunker somehow persuades himself that the world is laughing at someone else.\u201d</p> <p>The activist and author Amy Siskind was equally scathing. \u201cTrump hiding out in a bunker Friday, and shutting off the lights at the White House Sunday \u2013 both over a few hundred protesters \u2013 will be forever remembered as defining moments of his presidency when he was revealed as a coward, not the strongman he advertised.\u201d</p> <p>Colin Hanks, the actor son of Tom Hanks, described the incident as a metaphor for Trump\u2019s presidency.</p> <p>\u201cTrump is not leader. He KNOWS it in his bones. He is a coward. Turning off the lights, pretending no one is home while hiding in a bunker. There is no better metaphor for his, and his entire administration\u2019s failures. The election is in seven months. VOTE. HIM. OUT.\u201d</p> <p>Trump, who has tweeted encouraging the use of lethal force against \u201clooters\u201d, and warned protesters outside the White House of \u201cvicious dogs\u201d and \u201cominous weapons\u201d, has told advisers he worries about his safety, while both privately and publicly praising the work of the Secret Service.</p> <p>By Monday Trump was calling for \u201claw and order\u201d and blaming far-left agitators for a sixth straight night of violent nationwide protests.</p> <p>After his visit to the space Launch in Florida on Saturday, Trump returned to a White House under virtual siege, with protesters, some violent, gathered just a few hundred yards away through much of the night. Demonstrators returned on Sunday afternoon, facing off against police at Lafayette Park into the evening.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/31/george-floyd-donald-trump-protests-violence-looting\">George Floyd: Donald Trump under fire as violence flares across America</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe president and his family were rattled by their experience on Friday night, according to several advisers,\u201d the Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/31/us/politics/trump-protests-george-floyd.html\">report said</a>.</p> <p>Trump has been widely criticised for his response to the protests that have rocked the nation since video of Floyd\u2019s death began spreading on social media. <br><br>Despite days of peaceful protests and violent clashes with police in some of America\u2019s major cities, Trump has not addressed the nation and has repeatedly sent inflammatory messages over Twitter.</p> <p>Late on Friday, Trump tweeted that protesters could have been attacked with dogs and weapons wielded by the US Secret Service and accused the DC mayor for supposedly not providing police to protect the White House.</p> <p>\u201cThey let the \u2018protesters\u2019 scream and rant as much as they wanted, but whenever someone got too frisky or out of line, they would quickly come down on them, hard \u2013 didn\u2019t know what hit them,\u201d Trump said.</p> <p>\u201cIf they had [breached the fence],\u201d the president continued, \u201cthey would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.
