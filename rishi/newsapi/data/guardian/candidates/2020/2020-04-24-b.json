  "<p>On Thursday night, at a White House press briefing, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/24/trump-disinfectant-bleach-coronavirus-claims-reaction\">Donald Trump appeared to give</a> some pretty unorthodox suggestions about using disinfectant or sunlight to treat the coronavirus. But now he is backtracking \u2013 he says he was being sarcastic.</p> \n<p>Following a report which showed disinfectant can kill a virus within minutes when applied to different surfaces, the president addressed the press conference with a startling revelation. He said he had asked his medical advisers to look into whether light could be \u201cbrought inside the body\u201d, and whether with disinfectant \u201cwe can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning?\u201d </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ad6c83b5-067f-4fb6-983e-2764c3175db2\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BalDN6iGYpE?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>On Friday, after widespread disbelief at his comments, and after medical experts rejected his \u2018disinfectant injection\u2019 theory, he attempted to walk back his remarks.

  "<p>The leader of the most prominent group in the US peddling potentially lethal industrial bleach as a \u201cmiracle cure\u201d for coronavirus wrote to Donald Trump at the White House this week.</p> \n<p>In his letter, Mark Grenon told Trump that chlorine dioxide \u2013 a powerful bleach used in industrial processes such as textile manufacturing that can have fatal side-effects when drunk \u2013 is \u201ca wonderful detox that can kill 99% of the pathogens in the body\u201d. He added that it \u201ccan rid the body of Covid-19\u201d.</p> \n<p>A few days after Grenon dispatched his letter, Trump went on national TV at his daily coronavirus briefing at the White House on Thursday and promoted the idea that disinfectant could be used as a treatment for the virus. To the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/trump-coronavirus-treatment-disinfectant\">astonishment of medical experts</a>, the US president said that disinfectant \u201cknocks it out in a minute. One minute!\u201d</p> \n<p>He went on to say: \u201cIs there a way we can do something, by an injection inside or almost a cleaning? Because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs, so it\u2019d be interesting to check that.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ad6c83b5-067f-4fb6-983e-2764c3175db2\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BalDN6iGYpE?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Trump did not specify where the idea of using disinfectant as a possible remedy for Covid-19 came from, and the source for his notion remains obscure. But the Guardian has learned that peddlers of chlorine dioxide \u2013 industrial bleach \u2013 have been making direct approaches to the White House in recent days.</p> \n<p>Grenon styles himself as \u201carchbishop\u201d of Genesis II \u2013 a Florida-based outfit that claims to be a church but which in fact is the largest producer and distributor of chlorine dioxide bleach as a \u201cmiracle cure\u201d in the US. He brands the chemical as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/19/church-group-to-hold-washington-event-despite-fda-warnings-against-miracle-cure\">MMS</a>, \u201cmiracle mineral solution\u201d, and claims fraudulently that it can cure 99% of all illnesses including cancer, malaria, HIV/Aids as well as autism.</p> \n<p>Since the start of the pandemic, Genesis II has been marketing MMS as a cure to coronavirus. It advises users, including children, to mix three to six drops of bleach in water and drink it.</p> \n<p>In his weekly televised radio show, <a href=\"https://www.brighteon.com/aedb4e1b-3a47-434f-8548-7efe585a1cf1?fbclid=IwAR3iLyvkChEDLLv1_6gwu6A9ky2Zc93Ih0nBhiCPi5DoZQG2VjXarnIkmdw\">posted online</a> on Sunday, Grenon read out the letter he wrote to Trump. He said it began: \u201cDear Mr President, I am praying you read this letter and intervene.\u201d</p> \n<p>Grenon said that 30 of his supporters have also written in the past few days to Trump at the White House urging him to take action to protect Genesis II in its bleach-peddling activities which they claim can cure coronavirus.</p> \n<p>On Friday, hours after Trump talked about disinfectant on live TV, Grenon went further in a post on his <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/mark.grenon\">Facebook page</a>. He claimed that MMS had actually been sent to the White House. He wrote: \u201cTrump has got the MMS and all the info!!! Things are happening folks! Lord help others to see the Truth!\u201d</p> \n<p>Paradoxically, Trump\u2019s outburst about the possible value of an \u201cinjection\u201d of disinfectant into the lungs of Covid-19 sufferers came just days after a leading agency within the president\u2019s own administration took action to shut down the peddling of bleach as a coronavirus cure around the US.</p> \n<p>Last week the US Food and Drug Administration <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/bleach-coronavirus-us-orders-group-stop-selling\">obtained a federal court order</a> barring Genesis II from selling what was described as \u201can unproven and potentially harmful treatment for Covid-19\u201d. The FDA also ordered a disciple of Genesis II, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/mms-bleach-advocates-telegram-photos-child-injuries-2020-4\">Kerri Rivera</a>, to remove claims that MMS cured coronavirus from her website.</p> \n<p>Last August the FDA issued an urgent warning urging Americans not to buy or drink MMS, which it said was a \u201cdangerous bleach which has caused serious and potentially life-threatening side effects\u201d. Drinking MMS can cause nausea, diarrhea and severe dehydration that can lead to death, the federal agency said.</p> \n<p>The Guardian contacted the White House asking whether Grenon\u2019s letter had influenced Trump\u2019s comments on disinfectant, but did not immediately receive a response. </p> \n<p>Another advocate of bleach as a miracle cure who has been seeking to interest Trump in the treatment is Alan Keyes. He is a former ambassador and adviser to Ronald Reagan who ran unsuccessfully as a Republican candidate for the US Senate and on three occasions for the US presidency.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"29ae219a-db38-4e74-b8e0-effde9cb787b\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1bX8kEHTbug?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Keyes has featured Genesis II bleach products as a miracle cure on his online conservative TV show, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/live/?v=373915986891765&amp;ref=watch_permalink\">Let\u2019s Talk America</a>.</p> \n<p>It is not known whether Keyes has discussed MMS with Trump.

IAMtv\u2019s other leading anchor is Bob Sisson, who has also advertised Genesis II bleach products on air.</p> \n<p>In one of his shows, first reported by <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/alan-keyes-is-helping-sell-a-toxic-bleach-cure-miracle-mineral-solution-to-the-vulnerable-and-desperate\">the Daily Beast</a>, Sisson held up two bottles of Genesis II MMS and said: \u201cGonna meet Trump, it\u2019s only a matter of time. President Trump\u2019s gonna invite us up there, when he finds out about this stuff.\u201d</p> \n<p>On Friday Trump claimed he was being \u201csarcastic\u201d in his remarks but there is no evidence to back up that claim and he appeared entirely serious as he made them.</p>",

Or as the president put it this week in reference to his nightly press conferences that should ideally be guiding Americans on how not to die: \u201cI\u2019ve had great \u2018ratings\u2019 my whole life, there\u2019s nothing unusual about that for me. The White House News Conference ratings are \u2018through the roof\u2019 (Monday Night Football, Bachelor Finale) \u2026\u201d Congratulations to the star, showrunner and executive producer for having the vision to deliver this thing. Then again, shows with high body counts have always rated highly on US TV.</p> \n<p>Back on our own shores, meanwhile, the one useful moment in the Trump press conference was the bit where he imparted some \u2013 any \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/24/boris-johnson-sounds-incredible-ready-to-go-says-donald-trump\">information about Boris Johnson</a>, who remains off games. As you may recall, Britain has not had a working prime minister for some weeks now, in a moment of maximum crisis. But there is a sense \u2013 fostered by some of the most obnoxious people on Earth \u2013 that it would somehow be uncouth to dwell on how or even if decisions are being made. Instead, we are led by a cabinet <a href=\"https://slate.com/human-interest/2014/04/the-rat-king-or-roi-de-rats-is-a-very-creepy-conjoined-creature.html\">rat king</a>, with Dominic Raab\u2019s tail entwined with those of Matt Hancock, Michael Gove and Rishi Sunak. Eventually one of them \u2013 probably Sunak \u2013 will manage to bite off their own appendage to set themselves free. For now, the factions nip at each other off the record \u2013 and sometimes, at Johnson. \u201cThe prime minister is in a funny place,\u201d ran <a href=\"https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/11443302/boris-frightened-coronavirus-hit-hard/\">one kindly monstering</a> a few days ago. \u201cI think he\u2019s quite frightened.\u201d I bet you do.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/apr/24/uk-coronavirus-live-warning-mass-vaccinations-covid-19-latest-updates\">UK coronavirus live: officials apologise after key workers denied tests on day one of Hancock scheme</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The one entity everyone wants you to think is in charge, though, is The Science.

We have, at all times, been led by the government, whose job it is to take the scientific advice and make political decisions based on it. The ministers do not, in fact, all work for \u201cThe Science\u201d, the most suspiciously shadowy overlord since <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2015/08/14/entertainment/usual-suspects-movie-keyser-soze-feat/index.html\">Keyser S\u00f6ze</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe Science\u201d is not some monolithic stone tablet that gets handed to Raab to read out to the masses \u2013 and all scientists themselves know this. The claim that government would be \u201cled by the science\u201d was reassuring many weeks ago, at the start of all this. But now, through suspicious overuse to the exclusion of all other considerations, it has become troubling. Whenever some politician standing next to him says it these days, my overactive imagination fancies it sees a flicker behind the eyes of Chris Whitty. Is he realising that they are fitting him up to be the guy who needs at least 36 changes of shirt for the inevitable public inquiry? This week, some scientists advising the government <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexwickham/coronavirus-uk-scientists-human-shields\">told Buzzfeed</a> they feared they will be used by ministers as \u201chuman shields\u201d at such an event.</p> \n<p>Will they? You certainly wouldn\u2019t rule out Dominic Cummings\u2019s Downing Street believing they\u2019ve alighted on the perfect way to insulate themselves from blame \u2013 using scientists as a prophylactic. Call it a nerd immunity strategy, and pour yourself a celebratory disinfectant.</p> \n<p>\u2022 Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist</p>",

A return to the global game\u2019s top table at the sixth attempt of asking - nearly 24 years after the pioneers of 1974 blazed the trail.</p> <p>A once-in-a-generation crop of talent. A mix of exciting youth - a teenage Harry Kewell, a bustling Mark Viduka - and experienced stars like Tobin and Arnold. Will the Socceroos ever see the like of this squad? One of the world\u2019s top coaches - England and Barcelona\u2019s Terry Venables. He still hasn\u2019t lost a game in charge of the Socceroos since he came down under, but he\u2019ll taste the sickly sweet bile of defeat in his mouth tonight.</p> <p>The sadness in the voice of Craig Foster after full-time said it all. The emptiness of Johnny Warren\u2019s post-match analysis. It\u2019s inexplicable that this team - having played <em>that </em>match, aren\u2019t going to France to mix it with Rivaldo, Zinedine Zidane etc. They utterly dominated Iran, the Socceroos. It could have been five-nil inside the first ten minutes. They only needed one of those chances, and it all could have been so different.</p> <p>Harry Kewell and Aurelio Vidmar did put the Socceroos two to the good; but that most cruel of scorelines - 2-0, has reared it\u2019s head. And it\u2019s Iran going to France, courtesy of Karim Bagheri and Khodadad Azizi.</p> <p>That\u2019s all from me.

  "<p>Lucinda Williams has been sleep-talking more than usual. One night last week, she dreamed that Mormons invaded her house, converted her friends and stole her possessions. That wasn\u2019t the issue: \u201cThey were all sitting next to each other, and I said: \u2018Don\u2019t you understand, you\u2019re supposed to be quarantined!\u2019\u201d Williams laughs, her laconic outlaw baritone spilling into a surprising giggle. Her husband and manager, Tom Overby, told her she had grown agitated in her sleep. She thinks it came from the nightly TV marathons that have become their new lockdown routine, staying up until 5am watching the Jewish drama <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81019069\">Unorthodox</a>, \u201conly in my dream they came out as Mormons\u201d.</p> <p>Wiggy dreams are a quarantine staple, but Williams has had a lot to process lately. She and Overby only recently moved to Nashville and don\u2019t yet have any furniture. No sooner had they arrived than a tornado hit the city, taking part of their roof with it. Then coronavirus killed two old friends: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/08/hal-willner-music-producer-and-snl-supervisor-dies-aged-64\">Hal Willner</a>, who produced Williams\u2019s 2007 album, West, and the country musician <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/08/john-prine-us-folk-and-country-songwriter-dies-aged-73\">John Prine</a>. She last saw Prine in November when she played his festival in the Dominican Republic. \u201cIt\u2019s been insane,\u201d she says in disbelief, calling from her home.</p> <p>Now aged 67, Williams has written often about death in her 40-year career: songs such as Pineola, Sweet Old World, Lake Charles and Drunken Angel have become alt-country classics, often depicting complex men who might otherwise easily be reduced to caricature. That familiarity doesn\u2019t soften the losses. \u201cI think that\u2019s why I write about death,\u201d she says, her gorgeous accent kneading every vowel, \u201cbecause it\u2019s so hard to deal with.\u201d The subject features less on her new album, <a href=\"https://www.allmusic.com/album/good-souls-better-angels-mw0003357520\">Good Souls Better Angels</a>, although you could say it deals with worse fates: shame, depression, the uncanny horror of watching despots crush the values you hold dear.</p> <p>Williams\u2019s career renaissance started with 2014\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.metacritic.com/music/down-where-the-spirit-meets-the-bone/lucinda-williams\">Down Where the Spirit Meets the Bone</a>, yet Good Souls is yet another cut above: flinty garage blues that foregrounds the punk spirit Rough Trade recognised when the British label elevated her from relative obscurity with her 1988 self-titled third album. Now releasing her first collection of what she calls \u201ctopical\u201d songs, she has been baffled by critics asking why she wrote them (\u201cBecause I\u2019m frustrated and angry\u201d), or remarking on how \u201cprophetic\u201d Bad News Blues and Man Without a Soul (namely Trump) feel, mid-pandemic. Williams isn\u2019t psychic, just attuned to injustice: she keeps suitcases of unused lyrics dating back to the 1970s and weaves them through her writing. \u201cThere\u2019s always been something going on in this country to rebel against and be pissed off about,\u201d she says.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=272voTjeHy4\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/272voTjeHy4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Still, Williams says Trump is \u201cdifferent than anything I\u2019ve ever experienced in my entire lifetime\u201d. She knew \u201call the racism and the intolerance and the bigotry\u201d that he represents was part of the American psyche, \u201cbut I thought it had been suppressed to some degree, or that we had some control over it\u201d. Trump gave people of that mindset \u201cpermission in a subliminal way to come on out of the closet,\u201d she says. \u201c\u2018You can hate, you can get your guns and your anger.\u2019\u201d She\u2019s reeling from discovering, via a fractious Facebook thread about Man Without a Soul, that she has fans who are Trump supporters. \u201cThat\u2019s just incongruous,\u201d she says. \u201cHow can those things go together?\u201d Their comments kept her awake one night, although she ultimately found them validating. \u201cIt feels good to rebel. To tell you the honest truth, I don\u2019t mind pushing people\u2019s buttons, y\u2019know? I like to get a reaction out of people.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m not trying to say: \u2018Poor Ryan, he was all misunderstood.\u2019 I\u2019m just taking the situation and turning it into a song</p> <footer> <cite>Lucinda Williams</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Williams is no cheap rabble-rouser: it is her insistence on compassion and complexity that is provocative. There is pity even in Man Without a Soul. On the new song Wakin\u2019 Up, she reflects on an abusive relationship she was in around 2003. \u201cPulled the kitchen chair out from under me / He pulled my hair and then he kicks me / Next thing I swear, he wants to kiss on me,\u201d she rasps over choppy guitar. \u201cI used to judge women who were in these abusive, horrible relationships,\u201d she admits. \u201cAnd now here I was in the same situation. You just kinda numb yourself. It\u2019s easy when you love the person.\u201d Drunk on whiskey, that boyfriend would fly into violent rages that he forgot the next day. Then he started shooting heroin and cocaine. \u201cIt just got worse and worse until one night, he actually said: \u2018You need to get out.\u2019 He snapped-to long enough to realise what he was doing. So I totally understand the whole battered-woman syndrome; it\u2019s not black and white.\u201d</p> <p>That perspective fuels Shadows &amp; Doubts, a song billed in publicity as confronting \u201cour quick-to-judge, social-media-led society\u201d. I ask Williams if she had a specific situation in mind. For the first time, she is hesitant, outlining a situation whereby a male celebrity that she knows was accused of sexual harassment, but insisting the song should be \u201cmore universal or open to interpretation\u201d. I am surprised that she\u2019s surprised when I guess correctly that it\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/feb/14/the-ryan-adams-allegations-are-the-tip-of-an-indie-music-iceberg\">Ryan Adams</a>: he played on her 2001 album Essence and she wrote about his troubles \u2013 well documented before last year\u2019s accusations of sexual harassment (which he denies) \u2013 on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HqOIri7o8Q\">Little Rock Star</a>, from 2008\u2019s Little Honey.</p> <p>\u201cLook, I know Ryan, and I know he\u2019s fucked up a lot of things,\u201d she says plainly. \u201cHe\u2019s one of those people who you can love but he can also piss you off. God knows he\u2019s made enough mistakes.\u201d She says the song is not about the sexual allegations. \u201cThis is looking at somebody who basically fucked things up and trying to deal with seeing that person in that place but still being concerned about them. I still love Ryan. Do I agree with what he did? No. I\u2019m not trying to say: \u2018Oh, poor Ryan, he was all misunderstood.\u2019 I\u2019m just taking the situation and turning it into a song, but I think you can apply it to different things. I don\u2019t want this to seem like I\u2019m completely defending his actions.\u201d</p> <p>She is aghast that I might name him when she didn\u2019t, but I explain that I don\u2019t think her position is unreasonable: justice requires rehabilitation, even for the likes of Harvey Weinstein. \u201cWell, I agree,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd the other thing is, it\u2019s an illness. It\u2019s very taboo but it\u2019s another form of mental illness, and they need help.\u201d We talk about how the social urge to shame can be rooted in fear of our own worst instincts, prompting Williams to raise her love of Freud. \u201cWe all have the ability to go over the edge,\u201d she says. \u201cMy father used to describe it, like when a real close friend of the family committed suicide, as: we\u2019re all standing around the edge of this deep, dark well and some people jump or fall and others don\u2019t. We\u2019re all faced with the same temptations.\u201d</p> <p>Williams attributes her compassion to her childhood. Her mother, Lucille, experienced manic depression with paranoid schizophrenic tendencies. She was medicated with lithium in Williams\u2019s early years, leaving the three children mostly in the care of their father, the noted poet <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/miller-williams\">Miller Williams</a> (he read at Bill Clinton\u2019s 1997 inauguration). \u201cFrom the time I was very young, my father would take me aside and say: \u2018It\u2019s not your mother\u2019s fault, she\u2019s not well,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cI learned at an early age not to expect her to be a mother in the way that a traditional mother was supposed to be. But, thank God, I had my father to bond with. I think that\u2019s what saved me from an early age.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8eb6ee8e2cfdae1fea52aeefa567a2d2fc767b6b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8eb6ee8e2cfdae1fea52aeefa567a2d2fc767b6b/0_0_2464_3080/800.jpg\" alt=\"Lucinda Williams\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lucinda Williams onstage at last year\u2019s Cambridge folk festival.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Miller introduced his daughter to a world of writers; as a child, she chased <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/06/brief-survey-short-story-flanner-oconnor\">Flannery O\u2019Connor</a>\u2019s peacocks around her garden. That was what attracted her mother to him when they met at Louisiana State University. Miller\u2019s cultured background was the antithesis to her repressive, religious household (\u201cProbably somewhat abusive, too,\u201d says Williams). Lucille studied music, specifically piano, but largely dropped it when she married and had children. \u201cTo this day, I still don\u2019t know what my mother\u2019s dreams were,\u201d says Williams. \u201cIf she saw herself as a professional musician or not.\u201d</p> <p>After her parents split when she was 12, it was at Lucille\u2019s apartment in New Orleans that Williams heard <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/08/joan-baez-where-to-start-in-her-back-catalogue\">Joan Baez </a>and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/may/06/leonard-cohen-10-of-the-best\">Leonard Cohen</a> for the first time. She started gigging age 18, moving frequently between southern cities (plus a stint in New York). There was sometimes a piano in the apartment when she visited her mother. \u201cWhen she would get into these states where she didn\u2019t feel good about herself \u2013 maybe she wasn\u2019t on her medication \u2013 she would get rid of her piano,\u201d says Williams. \u201cShe would say something like: \u2018I just couldn\u2019t be around it any more\u2019, almost as if the piano came to represent something that either caused great joy or complete anxiety. But then she would inevitably get another piano and then she would get happy again.\u201d Williams saw the cycle play out several times. \u201cBut she never really talked about it more than that. Did it remind her of what she didn\u2019t accomplish? What was it?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You have to go into this deep, dark well, bring it back up and write about it.

After her mother\u2019s death in 2004, Williams wasn\u2019t left with much: just her psychology paperbacks (\u201cShe could talk to you about that all day\u201d) and notebooks. \u201cI ran across something she had written in one of her darker moments,\u201d she recalls. \u201cShe would shift into this place where she would be angry and almost kinda paranoid. And I saw something she\u2019d written down. It said: \u2018I\u2019m tired of living in Miller and Cindy\u2019s shadow.\u2019 See, I was called Cindy when I was growing up. Imagine seeing that written by your mother.\u201d</p> <p>How did it make her feel? \u201cSad,\u201d she says plainly, \u201cjust sad.\u201d Her voice cracks, then she says, warmly: \u201cI feel like I\u2019m gonna cry!\u201d I apologise, but she says: \u201cNo, it\u2019s good!\u201d Williams takes antidepressants for depression and anxiety, although she has never felt alienated from her music. The opposite: she recalls a boy asking her, after a gig in the 90s, how she wrote songs. \u201cI said: you have to go down into this deep, dark well and bring it back up and write about it.\u201d He looked at her, dismayed. \u201cHe goes: \u2018I can\u2019t do that!\u2019 It was one of the saddest things I\u2019ve ever heard. He was aware enough to know that he wasn\u2019t able to deal with the demons.

Self-ruled Taiwan has lost seven allies since 2016 when president Tsai Ing-wen was elected.</p> <p>The move came as China has increased its focus on the Pacific and sought to peel off Taiwan\u2019s allies in the region.</p> <p>Kiribati is thought to be of interest partly due to its location \u2013 some islands are just 700 km from US military installations \u2013 and also due to Christmas Island, the world\u2019s biggest atoll with a land mass of nearly 400 sq km. It lies just 2,150 km from Honolulu, home of the US Pacific Command and is far to the east of existing port facilities available to the Chinese navy.</p> <p>The lightly populated island already has a giant deepwater pier and a spare runway, and its lagoon could easily be turned into a port, experts say.</p> <p>\u201cThe Chinese could design the project as being intended for cruise ships, and incrementally turn it into a dual-use facility that could service Chinese warships,\u201d said Patrick Buchan, who tracks China at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.</p> <p>James Fanell, a former director of intelligence of the Pacific Fleet, agreed. \u201cIt\u2019s reasonable to think they will be helping renovate port facilities and airfields in order to help the country develop,\u201d he said. \u201cBut having Chinese ships pull in at the big pier would be clearly threatening to Honolulu, no question.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/sep/2019-09-20T05:35:29.html\" data-alt=\"Map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/maps/embed/sep/2019-09-20T05:35:29.html\">Map</a> </figure>  <h2>The switch</h2> <p>The leader of the party that broke away from the government over its handling of the switch, Banuera Berina, is expected to be more sceptical in his dealings with China and to take a hard line against accepting loans.

In March, when Tsai went on an official tour of the region, she also failed to visit Kiribati, which the government denounced as a snub.</p> <p>\u201cBased on my knowledge of Taiwan politics,\u201d said Natasha Kassam, who analyses Indo-Pacific strategy at the Lowy Institute in Sydney, \u201cthere\u2019s almost no scenario in which Tsai would have skipped a visit to Kiribati when in the region except for one where Maamau wasn\u2019t willing to entertain her.\u201d</p> <p>Banuera said he broke with Maamau when he found out from Taiwanese sources that in fact Tsai had been very eager to visit but was told it couldn\u2019t happen because Maamau would be in Fiji at the time.</p> <p>\u201cThe Taiwanese first offered to charter a plane so Maamau could get back in time, and when he refused, they even offered that President Tsai pick him up in Fiji on her way to Tarawa,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Maamau confirmed this but said it was a scheduling problem and both sides agree to hold the visit another time. None took place and Maamau announced the switch six months later.</p> <p>The Chinese foreign ministry was contacted for comment.</p>",
