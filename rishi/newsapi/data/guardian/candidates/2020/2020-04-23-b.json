Research shows that remittances help alleviate poverty in lower- and middle-income (LCMI) countries, and are linked with reductions in malnutrition, child labour, and missed school in disadvantaged households.<br><br>The dramatic fall will be felt sharply after a record $554bn was sent to LMICs in remittances in 2019 - overtaking foreign investment for the first time. The latter is predicted to drop by a whopping 35% next year, which means the decline in weekly or monthly money transfers to struggling families in countries such as Guatemala, Ethiopia, Afghanistan, and Ukraine will hit communities hard. The unprecedented crash in crude oil prices will also add to the woes.<br><br>The biggest falls are expected in Europe and Central Asia (27.5%), followed by Sub-Saharan Africa (23.1%), South Asia (22.1%), the Middle East and North Africa (19.6%), Latin America and the Caribbean (19.3%), and East Asia and the Pacific (13%).<br><br>On the bright-ish side, the World Bank reckons that remittances will recover slightly by 2021, to rise by an estimated 5.6% to $470 billion. But - and there are a lot of buts - this depends on how the pandemic evolves across the globe during the rest of the year, and the measures implemented to mitigate the spread of the virus. Also, remittance flows are typically counter-cyclical, as migrant workers tend to send more money to their families in times of crisis and hardship back home. But, this pandemic is truly global, and so is the economic fall-out.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-23T19:49:17.299Z\">at 8.49pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea1ec508f08eb2f433f562f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/jasonburke\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-23T19:34:25.542Z\">8.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Jason Burke</strong>, the Guardian\u2019s Africa correspondent, has written this dispatch on how <strong>South Africa</strong> will begin to ease its lockdown:</p> \n  <p>South Africa\u2019s president <strong>Cyril Ramaphosa</strong> spoke to the nation for the second time in three days on Thursday night, giving 56 million people the good news that the very strict lockdown that they have endured for nearly month would be lifted at the end of the month, but undoubtedly disappointing some by making it very clear that changes to the lives of many would not be substantial.</p> \n  <p>So far South Africa, which has been praised for its pro-active strategy of screening and testing to contain the Covid-19 virus, has nearly 4,000 confirmed cases and has suffered 75 deaths.

But from May 1st South Africa will move to level four, which will allow \u201csome activity to resume subject to extreme precautions\u201d. </p> \n  <p>Few further details were immediately available though Ramaphosa mentioned the phased reopening of schools. The country\u2019s borders will remain shut however. Level three would allow some social activities, but even level two would mean a continuing ban on religious services, sporting events, concerts, cinema and similar gatherings. </p> \n  <p>Ramaphosa stressed the risk of a new surge of infections, and though the president did not mention the coming winter, experts have repeatedly warned that the month ahead are likely to be difficult. Very significant restrictions look set to remain in place for six months at least. </p> \n  <p>\u201cLet us stay strong and united,\u201d Ramaphosa, a popular leader who took power in 2018 and won an election last year, said. <br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-23T19:37:04.367Z\">at 8.37pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea1e3698f08eb2f433f55eb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-23T19:24:41.881Z\">8.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Dubai</strong> has become the latest city to ease lockdown restrictions, announcing that cafes and restaurants are to reopen with a maximum capacity of 30 per cent. </p> \n  <p>Reuters reports public transportation services, including the subway, will resume from 26 April.

And amid a global pandemic, this year\u2019s month of fasting and reflection for the world\u2019s Muslims will be very different, writes <strong>Martin Chulov</strong>, the Guardian\u2019s Middle East editor.</p> \n  <p>Normally a sociable time, where abstaining from food and water during daylight hours gives way to sumptuous meals and gatherings at dusk, the 2020 rituals have been modified to fit public health directives that urge people to maintain a distance from each other while the coronavirus remains active. </p> \n  <p>Mosques will remain closed to evening prayers and feasting will become a more intimate affair, within the confines of family homes. Large public banquets, provided by authorities, or benefactors, have been outlawed in much of the Islamic world, where curfews and lockdowns remain rigidly enforced.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a06a0dd4eff7e5113090a2a67612eabcec73d27e\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a06a0dd4eff7e5113090a2a67612eabcec73d27e/0_0_2691_1815/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man uses a monocular during a gathering on the roof of Al Musariin mosque in Jakarta, Indonesia, to watch for the moon to mark the first day of Ramadan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"674\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man uses a monocular during a gathering on the roof of Al Musariin mosque in Jakarta, Indonesia, to watch for the moon to mark the first day of Ramadan</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Willy Kurniawan/Reuters</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Ahead of the fast there was even discussion about whether going without sustenance for much of the day may have an effect on immunity \u2013 and hence people\u2019s capacity to fight off Covid-19. However, with no clarity about whether this is the case, and evidence to support the contrary \u2013 that fasting may in fact be beneficial \u2013 the premise of this year\u2019s Ramadan remains unchanged.</p> \n  <p>\u201cMuslim religious authorities around the world are advocating wide restrictions on gatherings, in or out of mosques, as a result of the corona pandemic,\u201d said Dr HA Hellyer, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. \u201cThe mosques will remain virtually closed; the usual charity meal tables will be absent from the streets; and the frequent family socialising associated with Ramadan will be suspended.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Ramadan under lockdown is the antithesis of the festival. But, as Covid-19 took hold in the lead up to the fast, religious authorities and governments remained determined to ban congregational activities \u2013 a move that could deny the impoverished more than the chance to socialise. Charity is also an important part of the month, with cash, food and other donations regularly given to those with few means to afford them.</p> \n  <p>Mosques across the Middle East and north Africa \u2013 in Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco, Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Jordan, Iraq and the United Arab Emirates \u2013 have largely been shuttered throughout the crisis and will not offer shelter or seclusion to those fasting this year. </p> \n  <p>Some regional states have amended their curfew times to make it easier for people to shop during fasting hours. Coronavirus has even taken a toll on traditional Ramadan TV fare, with social distancing disrupting filming in the run-up, leaving shows unfinished. Clerical bodies, meanwhile, have encouraged people to embrace this year\u2019s restrictions by focusing on close family members.</p> \n  <p>In a statement earlier this month, Egypt\u2019s Grand Mufti, Shawki Allam, said: \u201cWe must look to the positive aspects during these exceptional times that have compelled many people to be quarantined in their homes and turn this into an opportunity for bonding and forgiveness and restoring the spirit of serenity and cooperation.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-23T12:59:57.722Z\">at 1.59pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea180ea8f08a1178d5b0551\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-23T12:02:56.601Z\">1.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In most of the world, medical staff have been lauded as heroes for their response to the coronavirus pandemic.

He also said that children or adolescents with a fever or symptoms consistent with the coronavirus should stay at home in quarantine.</p> \n  <p>The deputy prime minister also asked children in Spain to forgive the confusion the government had caused on Tuesday after it said children would be allowed out only to accompany a parent to buy food or medicine. A huge public outcry resulted in a u-turn within hours, and the government insisting that children would have more room to roam.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI want to say sorry because over the past few days and hours, the government hasn\u2019t been as clear as it could have been when it came to explaining how you\u2019ll be allowed to go out for walks with your families from Sunday,\u201d said Iglesias. </p> \n  <p>\u201cI know this confinement hasn\u2019t been at all easy for you - you\u2019ve had to stop going to school and seeing your teachers and friends.

Shopping in physical stores, recreational activities, personal services, and a long list of other types of spending have been sharply reduced.</p> <p>As a result, the businesses that normally provide these goods and services have sharply reduced activity, or shut down entirely. Absent any policy response, most of the employees of these businesses would lose their jobs, and face a dramatic reduction in income. In contrast, those working in sectors whose output is still in demand, for example food retail and online businesses, face no reduction in income at all or even experience increased income.</p> <p>But they are still unable or unwilling to consume goods and services that require social contact, so they end up with a large involuntary increase in savings. </p> </blockquote> <p>But there is some good news....

  "<h2>Trevor Noah</h2> <p>Trevor Noah called up New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo for Wednesday\u2019s Daily Social Distancing Show as the heart of America\u2019s coronavirus outbreak, New York City, stares down a long road to recovery. Noah asked Cuomo how, over six weeks into mass shutdowns, he\u2019s balancing the dueling pressures of keeping people safe versus reopening a devastated economy. \u201cThe pressure that people are under is phenomenal,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cIt is traumatic. This is traumatic for people, and that\u2019s the way I think about this.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1253292787845328902\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\u201cThe relationship between myself and the president is: he doesn\u2019t like me.&quot;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/NYGovCuomo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@NYGovCuomo</a> says he and Trump put aside personal beef in their White House meeting. <a href=\"https://t.co/0Q6WXp5DTB\">pic.twitter.com/0Q6WXp5DTB</a></p>&mdash; The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1253292787845328902?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 23, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Bills are still being collected, jobs are lost or may never return, and \u201cpeople are about to burst, on one level, they\u2019re under that kind of pressure\u201d, he continued. \u201cOn the other hand, we had 474 people die yesterday. You tell me how many people go outside today and touch other people, I\u2019ll tell you how many people walk into a hospital three days from now. The cause and effect is that tight.\u201d</p> <p>In New York, where social distancing can\u2019t occur \u2013 you\u2019re not getting 6ft of space on a subway car, ever \u2013 the number of cases will increase as places open up. \u201cIt\u2019s an impossible balance, Trevor,\u201d Cuomo said. Ultimately, he said, it comes down to the data (death rate, hospitalization rate); \u201cyou don\u2019t start to reopen until you have those numbers under control.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/apr/22/stephen-colbert-trump-immigration-trevor-noah-jimmy-kimmel\">Stephen Colbert blasts Trump's 'reality show-style' immigration ban via tweet</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As for recovery, \u201cit has to be phased in, it has to be slow and building, and watch that infection rate as you start to open up the valve to reopen\u201d, said Cuomo.</p> <p>Noah also asked the governor about his relationship with Donald Trump and the federal government. \u201cThe relationship between myself and the president is, the president doesn\u2019t like me,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cThat is the relationship.

They\u2019re already used to working for a mummified corpse,\u201d Bee added next to a photo of Fox News\u2019 owner, Rupert Murdoch.</p> <p>\u201cAs scary as it is to hear these idiots dismiss people\u2019s lives, it\u2019s really terrifying that elected officials are saying it too,\u201d Bee continued. And no one is saying that louder, more \u201call-caps\u201d, than Trump, who last week said that America \u201cwants to be open\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cAh, yes, \u2018America wants to be open\u2019,\u201d Bee said. \u201cThe \u2018she was asking for it\u2019 of coronavirus relief measures.\u201d</p> <p>Bee acknowledged that for many Americans, \u201cit\u2019s understandable to feel angry and upset\u201d, especially since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/23/us-unemployment-claims-benefits-coronavirus\">26</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/23/us-unemployment-claims-benefits-coronavirus\"> million people are now out of work</a>. \u201cBut reopening the economy prematurely could backfire and lead to another shutdown. We\u2019re not facing a choice between saving lives or saving the economy. The simple fact is, the economy is people. And dead people don\u2019t buy stuff.\u201d</p> <p>So though Americans love \u201cquick and easy fixes\u201d like \u201cgas station boner pills\u201d, Bee concluded, \u201cthe only way out of this mess is to finish the hard work we\u2019ve begun\u201d with shutdown measures and physical distancing. \u201cThe process to return to normal will be long, hard, sometimes painful \u2013 which, coincidentally is the slogan for those boner pills.

How did Trump celebrate the occasion? By \u201cthreatening to blow up chunks of the planet\u201d with a bizarre tweet about instructing the navy to \u201cshoot down\u201d Iranian gunboats if they \u201charass our ships at sea\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cHere\u2019s the thing: Trump\u2019s attempt to change the subject to immigration or to China or Iran or to anything is not gonna work,\u201d Colbert said. \u201cTrump\u2019s normal tricks he uses to change the narrative aren\u2019t working, because it\u2019s hard to come up with a more gripping narrative than stay inside or you might die. You can tweet all you want, but it\u2019s hard to capture people\u2019s hearts and minds when they\u2019re worried about their hearts and lungs.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t have Bill Barr redact the virus or call Ukraine to get dirt on Hunter Virus, or get Mitch McConnell to have 51 Republicans vote that there is no virus,\u201d he continued, addressing Trump. \u201cYou can\u2019t even pay the virus $130,000 to stay quiet, which is too bad, because this virus is definitely spanking your ass. So if you want to keep your job, you\u2019re gonna have to do the unthinkable: your job!\u201d</p>",

Trump, who still appears in daily press conferences with a team of public health experts such as Dr Anthony Fauci, has wavered on the issue. He has urged protesters to \u201cliberate\u201d several Democratic states from their lockdowns and usually appears keen for a swift reopening, but he has also criticized the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/23/georgia-businesses-wary-governor-brian-kemp-reopen\">Republican governor of Georgia</a> for reopening too early.</p> <p>While the public still largely supports shutdown efforts, the risk, some say, is that disagreements over the pandemic response devolve into another American culture war, like abortion and gun rights.</p> <p>\u201cDonald Trump is not going to go into this election siding with Dr Fauci against this Tea Party-like movement. If he thinks that this is what his base wants, he will go with them,\u201d said <a href=\"https://thebulwark.com/author/charlessykes/\">Charlie Sykes</a>, a conservative anti-Trump author and broadcaster in Wisconsin. </p> <p>Critics of Liz and Richard Uihlein say it is impossible to overstate the couple\u2019s influence over conservative politics and that Liz Uihlein\u2019s outspoken criticism of the stay-at-home orders will act like \u201cjet fuel\u201d to accelerate political opposition to policies that have been endorsed by public health experts.</p> <p>Neither Uihlein has been shy about endorsing rightwing causes \u2013 especially anti-union and anti-tax groups \u2013 and fringe candidates, like Roy Moore, the Republican Senate candidate who was accused of sexual assault of minors and lost a special election in 2017.</p> <p>Like the Mercers and the Kochs, the couple has rarely given interviews.</p> <p>But reached at home this week by the Guardian, Liz Uihlein \u2013 who was one of 36 executives to be invited to participate in a call with Trump last month to discuss the national response to Covid-19 \u2013 expressed her dismay at Wisconsin\u2019s handling of the crisis, which she said was devastating the economy.</p> <p>Of nearly 7,000 employees, Uihlein claimed that her company had seen 15 cases of Covid-19 infection and that six were back at work.</p> <p>An anonymous employee told the Guardian that the company had previously reported 19 cases in internal communications, and has since stopped sending out alerts.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s overhyped,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t wish anybody ill will.

In the country it\u2019s not as rampant as the press would have you make it.\u201d</p> <p>The company, which has remained open because it is considered an essential business, has come under fire for allegedly adopting lax safety practices in the face of the pandemic, including initially discouraging employees from working at home and not providing enough space to the non-warehouse employees who did come to work.</p> <p>Uihlein said the work-from-home recommendations were dragging on the company and that tasks that would take \u201cfive minutes to get done at the office takes two days\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe have no choice with a lot of them,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Uihlein, who said she and her husband \u201cloved Trump\u201d and is believed to have a net worth of about $4bn, laughed off suggestions that she might influence the president.</p> <p>\u201cYou honestly think that money influences Donald Trump, are you kidding me?\u201d she said.</p> <p>But Uline, she and her husband\u2019s privately held company, has already donated $1.5m to Trump\u2019s Super Pac, America First Action, and $20m to other Republican groups so far in the 2020 election cycle. In the past, their donations topped $90m, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.</p> <p>In her interview with the Guardian, Liz Uihlein, who is 74, repeatedly compared the current crisis to polio outbreaks in the 1940s and 1950s \u2013 her own sister contracted the disease when they were children \u2013 and suggested Americans then had not \u201cshut down\u201d communities to deal with those outbreaks.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a terrifically scary thing.

Polio had been ravaging communities for decades <a href=\"https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/salk-announces-polio-vaccine\">before a vaccine was discovered in 1953</a> and large segments of the population had developed immunity to the virus.

Those outbreaks also occurred at a time when populations were far less mobile than today.</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Uihlein family said in a post-publication statement to the Guardian that it was not involved in donations related to protests of shelter-in-place orders.</p> <p><em>Do you have more information about this story?

  "<p>Donald Trump has inevitably made coronavirus about immigration. \u201cIn light of the attack from the Invisible Enemy, as well as the need to protect the jobs of our GREAT American Citizens,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1252418369170501639\">Trump </a>tweeted, \u201cI will be signing an Executive Order to temporarily suspend immigration into the United States!\u201d Nativism renders this \u201cinvisible enemy\u201d visible in the form of human beings who can be painted as a threat and blamed for our problems.</p> <p>Staff then rushed to draft an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/22/us/politics/coronavirus-immigration-green-cards.html\">executive order</a> that comports with Trump\u2019s tweet. But travel bans already covered Europe and China, land borders with Mexico and Canada were mostly closed, unauthorized border crossers were automatically deported, refugee resettlement was globally suspended, and ordinary visa processing was frozen. That\u2019s on top of Trump\u2019s prior banning of people from Muslim-majority and African countries, slashing refugee admissions, and forcing asylum seekers to remain in Mexico. Immigration had already been all but halted.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Nativism has always thrived by providing visible substitutes for 'invisible enemies'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It turns out, however, that exceptions will be made for guest workers. That\u2019s because nativism have always run up against business\u2019 demand for labor. This emergency, however, could reset the contours of that debate, just as the first world war-era red scare weakened business opposition to restriction, facilitating the passage of the national origins quotas, which sharply limited immigration along brazenly racist lines from the 1920s through 1965. This is the golden age that nativists like Stephen Miller take inspiration from.</p> <p>Trump is moving to hermetically seal the country, making real the fantastic promise of his pledged \u201cimpenetrable WALL\u201d. What ordinary politics could not secure, a global pandemic has delivered: a nativist, if temporary and ad hoc, fever dream. It could get much worse, and more permanent, too.</p> <p>Coronavirus has accelerated the dynamics that enabled Trump\u2019s nativist presidency and the global rise of the far right. The countries that long benefited from global dominance have for decades failed to broadly redistribute empire\u2019s benefits to their citizens: neoliberalism decimated worker power, stagnated wages, and funeled wealth to the richest. The same geopolitics that delivered such massive wealth and power to the global north also led to the mass arrival of migrants. Without a powerful left, nativist nationalism is the interpretative frame that won out. Nativism has always thrived by providing visible substitutes for \u201cinvisible enemies,\u201d from the abstract violence of global capitalism to the US empire raging against its unexpected limits.</p> <p>Since the Clinton administration, business has been content with a bipartisan war on \u201cillegal immigrants\u201d and the militarization of the border as long <em>legal</em> immigration remained untouched. While Trump has failed to secure legislative cuts to legal immigration, he has done a lot to restrict it administratively. Covid-19 provides him with incredible new opportunities. But the guest worker exemption shows that business still wields ample power in the conservative coalition, and that racist and culture war policy must bend to the profit imperative.</p> <p>Trump and his allies have celebrated the ban in the language of rightwing populism, emphasizing its purported economic benefits for working-class Americans. In court, however, the executive order will likely be defended on the same national security grounds that were successfully marshalled to defend the Muslim ban, this time under the guise of the nation\u2019s public health.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The pandemic, of course, has exposed the inescapability of human sociality and proven the libertarian premise that every man is an island to be a lie</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The pandemic, of course, has exposed the inescapability of human sociality and proven the libertarian premise that every man is an island to be a lie. Nationalism\u2019s promise to protect Americans behind secure borders has likewise been shown to be empty: as long as coronavirus exists in one place it threatens every place. But contrary evidence has never easily demolished powerful ideologies.</p> <p>Instead, the trajectory of the pandemic will, if left unchecked, reaffirm the very status quo that is facilitating its spread. The same global inequalities that drive immigration and facilitate the xenophobic response to it could create a situation where the virus is tamed in the global north while it ravages the global south. Massive outbreaks in poor countries could then lead to this temporary shutdown in human movement transitioning into a more permanent system that locks much of the poor world behind a massive cordon sanitaire.</p> <p>If Trump\u2019s suspension of immigration survives legal challenge, creating this new multi-tiered system of travel and immigration restriction will only require that he selectively lift bans on particular countries. Declaring wealthy countries as \u201ccorona-free\u201d would provide a facially non-discriminatory public health pretext for enacting a fundamentally racist program. The only way to exit the nativist hellscape is to fight for a redistribution of the resources that the global south needs to fight the pandemic. The struggle against the xenophobic far-right is now also fundamentally a fight for a globally just response to Covid-19, including massive debt relief. The solution to a global pandemic must be global in scope. If it\u2019s not, Trump\u2019s makeshift solution will be to further split the world into pieces.</p>",

I think we were in about 24 hours before the United States, but we made the decision about the same time and it was the extraordinary discipline of our Chinese Australian community, which meant that we resisted that first wave of cases. The wave of cases that impacted Australia came from predominantly returning Australians from other parts of the world, where the virus had transmitted to out of China. <br></p> \n   <p>What\u2019s important is that we work together in a transparent way.

There are serious questions to be asked about that, because when they go viral there can be a massive misinformation problem that any government or democracy experiences.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-23T01:53:29.141Z\">at 2.53am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea0f2a78f08a1178d5b00e3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-23T01:45:57.210Z\">2.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Peter Dutton</strong> has appeared for his regular cosy chat with Sydney radio host <strong>Ray Hadley</strong>.</p> \n  <p>Today, Hadley was very, very upset about the NRL and the possibility that Queensland premier <strong>Annastacia Palaszczuk</strong> may not loosen the border restrictions to let the Queensland teams in and out without any issues.</p> \n  <p>I mean, she has asked the NRL for its plan, which doesn\u2019t seem entirely unreasonable, but then again, I am at a loss at to how Hadley defines \u201creasonable\u201d and not sure I ever want to find out.</p> \n  <p>Dutton, asked about whether the New Zealand players would be allowed in, says:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Well, Ray, it\u2019s obviously a complex picture and you\u2019re right, everybody wants to see the NRL start up again, we want to see the footy and we want to see other sports as well, even for kids who are stuck at home at the moment doing, you know, their work online, we\u2019ve got to get those kids active again and people back interested in normal aspects of life. <br></p> \n   <p>So getting the NRL up and started, I think, is a very important part of the next steps that we take to normalise and return to the way it was only a few months ago. <br></p> \n   <p>So we\u2019re in discussions with the NRL at the moment, I\u2019ll have a chat with <strong>Peter V\u2019Landys </strong>again later today. <br></p> \n   <p>Obviously, as you point out, the Border Force commissioner has discretion to allow people in, now he has allowed a number of people in on compassionate grounds and other considerations around work and people with expertise coming in. There have been certain exemptions, as I understand. <br></p> \n   <p>But for many, as you rightly point out, that request has been rejected. So, we just need to look at what is reasonable in the circumstance. <br></p> \n   <p>Obviously New Zealand is a very low-risk country for us given the very low numbers of cases, and people would have to go into quarantine in accordance with the state jurisdiction\u2019s Department of Health requirements so, if the Warriors were to come into NSW or Queensland they would have to go through two weeks of isolation, as would be the case for everybody else \u2026 we just need to clarify what [Palaszczuk\u2019s] position is and the position of the premiers otherwise, so there\u2019s a lot of work to do but we all want to see it up and started as soon as possible.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-23T01:49:54.574Z\">at 2.49am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea0efdb8f084784dca58448\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-23T01:31:29.500Z\">2.31am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Well, something didn\u2019t go to plan <br></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jekearsley/status/1253132555030638592\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Chief Medical Office Professor Brendan Murphy says authorities including NSW Health carried out a training exercise in May last year = for a cruise ship arriving into Sydney - with a pandemic on board. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/9NewsAUS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@9newsaus</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/auspol?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#auspol</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/RubyPrincess?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#RubyPrincess</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/coronavirus?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#coronavirus</a></p>\u2014 Jonathan Kearsley (@jekearsley) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jekearsley/status/1253132555030638592?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 23, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea0ef278f08a1178d5b00d2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-23T01:29:52.313Z\">2.29am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The AFL is preparing to restart its season:<br></p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/23/sydney-should-be-considered-for-hub-as-afl-prepares-to-set-return-date\">Sydney 'should be considered' for hub as AFL prepares to set return date</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n  <p>There are no AFL islands being discussed, but there are hubs.</p> \n  <p>Meanwhile, <strong>Mason Cox </strong>had a few things to say about how his homeland was handling the pandemic.

  "<p>Manuel\u2019s Tavern, an institution in the unofficial capital of the American south, has been at the forefront of all things politics in Atlanta for the last 50 years, but on Friday the bar popular with the city\u2019s power brokers will sit out the battle brewing in Georgia over the reopening of the state\u2019s economy.</p> <p>The conservative Republican governor, Brian Kemp, has announced Georgians will be able to get a tattoo, go bowling and get their nails done starting on Friday and sit at a table in a restaurant at the start of next week.

Free agency showed a new era may be dawning in Cincinnati and Burrow is the man to make it concrete.</p> <h2><strong>2) Washington</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj1ybSN9WWQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Vj1ybSN9WWQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/chase-young?id=3219594f-5514-6550-d662-263c81d981b1\">Chase Young, edge rusher, Ohio State</a>.</strong> Washington have a no-brainer of their own in Young. Ron Rivera can build a strong defensive identity with a player following in the footsteps of premium Ohio State edge defenders, Joey and Nick Bosa. A 6ft 5in wrecking-ball whose tremendous speed off the line allowed him to rack up 16.5 sacks, 21.5 tackles for a loss and seven forced fumbles across 12 games in 2019. Tua Tagovailoa could be an upgrade on Dwayne Haskins but the inability to assess the quarterback\u2019s fitness up close makes Young the sensible pick.</p> <h2><strong>3) Detroit Lions</strong></h2> <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jeffrey-okudah?id=32194f4b-5519-2813-7f59-b79efab52dd1\">Jeffrey Okudah, cornerback, Ohio State</a>.</strong> The Lions need a replacement for Darius Slay after trading him to Philadelphia. Okudah can slip straight into Slay\u2019s role as Detroit\u2019s leader in the backfield and make an impact as the best shutdown corner entering the league.</p> <h2><strong>4) New York Giants</strong></h2> <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jedrick-wills?id=32195749-4c62-6320-8b63-20c37d057bf8\">Jedrick Wills, offensive tackle, Alabama</a>.</strong> Offensive line is a must-upgrade for the Giants. Wills, Mekhi Becton and Tristan Wirfs all would do exactly that for head coach, Joe Judge, but Wills makes sense as Judge was once Nick Saban\u2019s assistant in Alabama. Familiarity tips the scales in Wills\u2019s favour without the ability to meet with prospects this year owing to lockdown.</p> <h2><strong>5) Miami Dolphins</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LYdrN7nM7Y\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_LYdrN7nM7Y?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/justin-herbert?id=32194845-5203-1169-a699-ce41d700202a\">Justin Herbert, quarterback, Oregon</a>.</strong> The Dolphins can pick from the best of the rest with Burrow off the board. Herbert gets the nod over Tagovailoa due to the latter\u2019s fitness problems. His 6ft 6in frame and huge arm pass the eye test. Three rushing touchdowns against Wisconsin in Oregon\u2019s Rose Bowl victory showed he can shift when needed too.</p> <h2><strong>6) Los Angeles Chargers</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e9593a1aab4f64ff41fa8deac600cc2fe0d0f0aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9593a1aab4f64ff41fa8deac600cc2fe0d0f0aa/0_108_3240_1944/1000.jpg\" alt=\"There is no questioning Tua Tagovailoa\u2019s ability but his injury history may see him drop down the draft\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">There is no questioning Tua Tagovailoa\u2019s ability but his injury history may see him drop down the draft.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vasha Hunt/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tua-tagovailoa?id=32195441-4762-0344-3a46-269f5e5e854e\">Tua Tagovailoa, quarterback, Alabama</a>.</strong> The Chargers need some pop on their offense and Alabama\u2019s QB offers just that. The talent is there - Tagovailoa was on course for a monster season before a dislocated hip cut it to nine games. And Tyrod Taylor can start the season if Tagovailoa requires extra time to prepare. The Chargers\u2019 intimidating defense needs an offense to match.</p> <h2><strong>7) Carolina Panthers</strong></h2> <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/20/isaiah-simmons-nfl-draft-football-clemson\">Isaiah Simmons, linebacker, Clemson</a>.</strong> Matt Rhule\u2019s first pick as Carolina head coach is made easy by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/20/isaiah-simmons-nfl-draft-football-clemson\">the highly versatile Simmons\u2019 availability</a>. Rhule has emphasised his preference for speed so Simmons is perfect. The Panthers are handily just a short trip into North Carolina from Clemson.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/20/isaiah-simmons-nfl-draft-football-clemson\">Is the positionless Isaiah Simmons a glimpse of the NFL's future?</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>8) Arizona Cardinals</strong></h2> <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/derrick-brown?id=32194252-4f39-3541-fadb-33b669a1b580\">Derrick Brown, defensive tackle, Auburn</a>.</strong> Wide receiver was the problem area for Kliff Kingsbury before the Houston head coach, Bill O\u2019Brien, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/16/deandre-hopkins-arizona-cardinals-houston-texans-trade-nfl\">gifted DeAndre Hopkins to the Cardinals</a>. Brown would tie in well with general manager Steve Keim\u2019s additions of linebacker Devon Kennard and defensive tackle Jordan Phillips. Brown is a great player with immense power behind his 326lb frame to disrupt an offense.</p> <h2><strong>9) Jacksonville Jaguars</strong></h2> <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/javon-kinlaw?id=32194b49-4e70-8236-d068-74d6202e4019\">Javon Kinlaw, defensive tackle, South Carolina</a>.</strong> Jacksonville\u2019s once-great defense is in tatters across the board but tackle is a glaring hole that needs filling. Kinlaw is the next man up from Brown. His combination of imposing size, raw power and quickness make him an immediate starter for the Jaguars.</p> <h2><strong>10) Cleveland Browns</strong></h2> <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tristan-wirfs?id=32195749-5237-0129-a756-9a5ceb881ea0\">Tristan Wirfs, offensive tackle, Iowa</a>.</strong> Wirfs is a good fit for the Browns coach, Kevin Stefanski, whose zone-blocking scheme matches with Iowa\u2019s system. Wirfs is a superb athlete who blew the field away at the combine with an OT record 36.5in vertical jump, a 10ft 1in broad jump that tied the record and a class-topping 40 time of 4.85sec.</p> <h2><strong>11) New York Jets</strong></h2> <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/mekhi-becton?id=32194245-4381-4547-3cf4-9d445d134d9a\">Mekhi Becton, offensive tackle, Louisville</a>.</strong> Sam Darnold needs protection and Becton can make an instant impact for both the passing game and by creating running room for Le\u2019Veon Bell. He tips the scales at 364lb but has quickness despite his gigantic 6ft 7in frame.</p> <h2><strong>12) Las Vegas Raiders</strong></h2> <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ceedee-lamb?id=32194c41-4d13-8457-fcbe-d37fdbd87233\">CeeDee Lamb, wide receiver, Oklahoma</a>. </strong>The cream of a highly-talented crop of receivers. Lamb has drawn comparisons to DeAndre Hopkins due to his ability to make contested catches. His impressive speed and strength after the catch shows he has a path to becoming a better player than Hopkins.</p> <h2><strong>13) San Francisco 49ers</strong></h2> <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/henry-ruggsiii?id=32195255-4731-8217-5970-b4a47789eeaf\">Henry Ruggs, wide receiver, Alabama</a>.</strong> Ruggs could provide another dimension to Kyle Shanahan\u2019s offense in 2020. A blistering 40 time of 4.27sec, the third best ever at the Combine, could be the perfect complement to Deebo Samuel\u2019s versatility. Hands you can trust with five passes dropped in three seasons at Alabama.</p> <h2><strong>14) Tampa Bay Buccaneers</strong></h2> <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/andrew-thomas?id=32195448-4f02-5763-1c5b-1459b2c5ddf0\">Andrew Thomas, offensive tackle, Georgia</a>.</strong> Tom Brady will be 43 when the season (hopefully) starts in September. The Bucs must keep him standing at all costs. Thomas is the best available lineman to let Brady remind Bill Belichick what he\u2019s missing.</p> <h2><strong>15) Denver Broncos</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQmtcaoEC0g\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZQmtcaoEC0g?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jerry-jeudy?id=32194a45-5541-5291-9f8b-8595dc100c90\">Jerry Jeudy, wide receiver, Alabama</a>.</strong> Denver need a receiver to partner Courtland Sutton, so Jeudy is the pick. He\u2019s so good at shedding coverage that \u201cto Jeudy\u201d has become a verb around his home of south Florida.</p> <h2><strong>16) Atlanta Falcons</strong></h2> <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/a.j.-epenesa?id=32194550-4541-5291-9369-b9d0c170a565\">AJ Epenesa, edge rusher, Iowa</a>.</strong> Atlanta have beefed up their offense, so logic dictates the Falcons going the opposite way in the draft. Epenesa is a premium edge rusher who can help solidify Dan Quinn\u2019s frontline.</p> <h2><strong>17) Dallas Cowboys</strong></h2> <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/k%27lavon-chaisson?id=32194348-4103-1652-cb42-0c501912b1a9\">K\u2019Lavon Chaisson, edge rusher, LSU</a>. </strong>Chaisson can fill the void left by Robert Quinn on the edge and form a formidable pass-rushing partnership with DeMarcus Lawrence. The line as a whole starts to look a little scary with Gerald McCoy and Dontari Poe in the mix.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/22/why-the-nfls-lockdown-draft-may-be-the-oddest-and-best-yet\">Why the NFL's lockdown draft may be the oddest and best yet</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>18) Miami Dolphins</strong></h2> <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/austin-jackson?id=32194a41-4304-1754-a4d4-5902e423feaa\">Austin Jackson, offensive tackle, USC</a>. </strong>The Dolphins need help to protect their shiny new quarterback. Jackson, at just 20, is a long-term project who can grow with Herbert and allow the quarterback to play with more time than Ryan Fitzpatrick was allowed last season.</p> <h2><strong>19) Las Vegas Raiders</strong></h2> <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/c.j.-henderson?id=32194845-4e05-3672-fd87-85ca08961509\">CJ Henderson, cornerback, Florida</a>. </strong>After adding a receiver earlier in the first-round, the Raiders\u2019 thoughts should turn to the formidable passing attacks in the AFC West. Eli Apple\u2019s deal may have gone awry but Henderson\u2019s athleticism can be a building block to a solid secondary.</p> <h2><strong>20) Jacksonville Jaguars</strong></h2> <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/a.j.-terrell?id=32195445-5227-2956-3d70-15eacafe6b00\">AJ Terrell, cornerback, Clemson</a>. </strong>Jacksonville\u2019s defensive rebuild continues with Terrell in the backfield. A tough, fast corner to begin the project of replacing Jalen Ramsey and AJ Bouye.</p> <h2><strong>21) Philadelphia Eagles</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c56bdaeb8461347172084b6949c46fef2d7d2628\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c56bdaeb8461347172084b6949c46fef2d7d2628/0_0_2220_1480/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Justin Jefferson could team up with Carson Wentz in Philly\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Justin Jefferson could team up with Carson Wentz in Philly.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Bazemore/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/justin-jefferson?id=32194a45-4626-9287-c454-479b942cbd26\">Justin Jefferson, wide receiver, LSU</a>.</strong> Alshon Jeffrey can\u2019t stay healthy while Nelson Agholor has deserted to Las Vegas. The Eagles select Jefferson, adding a receiver with pace to burn and great hands.</p> <h2><strong>22) Minnesota Vikings</strong></h2> <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kristian-fulton?id=32194655-4c73-3491-274a-7b3b8a1d4f92\">Kristian Fulton, cornerback, LSU</a>.</strong> The departure of Xavier Rhodes, Trae Waynes, and Mackensie Alexander mean the Vikings have to work on their secondary. Fulton, drawing comparisons to All-Pro Tre\u2019Davious White, should be an immediate starter.</p> <h2><strong>23) New England Patriots</strong></h2> <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/kenneth-murray?id=32194d55-5256-3490-574a-1b8a86aa691f\">Kenneth Murray, linebacker, Oklahoma</a>.</strong> The pick everyone is waiting for. Jordan Love? Nope. The Pats go after Murray and get a playmaker in the spine of their defense who is versatile, fast and a future leader for Belichick.</p> <h2><strong>24) New Orleans Saints</strong></h2> <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/patrick-queen?id=32195155-4530-8806-168a-7e9ee3bd3f96\">Patrick Queen, linebacker, LSU</a>. </strong>New Orleans have one of the strongest rosters so they can pick up the best player still on the board, Queen. A strong, imposing defender who will instantly strengthen their linebacker unit.</p> <h2><strong>25) Minnesota Vikings</strong></h2> <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/tee-higgins?id=32194849-4738-7791-9f89-d556c4b59b9a\">Tee Higgins, Clemson, wide receiver</a>.</strong> Much like their previous pick, the Vikings need to repair holes left in free agency. Stefon Diggs is out the door and passing him on the way in is Higgins. At 6ft 4in he would be an excellent weapon for Kirk Cousins on the outside and in the redzone.</p> <h2><strong>26) Miami Dolphins</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1ilIYyfaCY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/N1ilIYyfaCY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/denzel-mims?id=32194d49-4d62-4399-5aee-b92ce1fc40e6\">Denzel Mims, wide receiver, Baylor</a>.</strong> Miami jump on the receiver train to continue bolstering their offense and join up with DeVante Parker. Mims has an impressive highlight reel of acrobatic catches at Baylor.</p> <h2><strong>27) Seattle Seahawks</strong></h2> <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/yetur-gross-matos?id=32194752-4f61-0423-9bac-e2b343fce23e\">Yetur Gross-Matos, edge rusher, Penn State</a>.</strong> Jadeveon Clowney appears not be re-signing in Seattle so they need someone new who can get to the quarterback. Gross-Matos recorded 9.5 sacks in 2019 and fits with Pete Carroll\u2019s defensive philosophy.</p> <h2><strong>28) Baltimore Ravens</strong></h2> <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/cesar-ruiz?id=32195255-4941-5291-5447-fa1de6f9c62b\">Cesar Ruiz, center, Michigan</a>.</strong> Ruiz can play across the interior line positions so chimes with Baltimore\u2019s penchant for versatile players. Ruiz might struggle to fill Marshal Yanda\u2019s shoes but the Ravens still have to find a way to maintain their explosive offense this season.</p> <h2><strong>29) Tennessee Titans</strong></h2> <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jaylon-johnson?id=32194a4f-4834-1277-a78d-0224e4072abc\">Jaylon Johnson, cornerback, Utah</a>.</strong> Johnson can fill a void in the slot for Tennessee while providing depth to defend against the pass.</p> <h2><strong>30) Green Bay Packers</strong></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ki92VlkEic\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0ki92VlkEic?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jordan-love?id=32194c4f-5613-0776-be4c-ce231b05c522\">Jordan Love, quarterback, Utah State</a>.</strong> Brett Favre to Aaron Rodgers to Love. Rodgers may not be finished but Green Bay have nothing in reserve, yet. Love can learn from the best until it\u2019s time to take on the mantle.</p> <h2><strong>31) San Francisco 49ers</strong></h2> <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/ross-blacklock?id=3219424c-4124-6567-64a2-94c97f8f8038\">Ross Blacklock, defensive tackle, TCU</a>. </strong>Blacklock showed he can pass rush from the inside in college using speed from the snap to get to the quarterback. May not replace DeForest Buckner but the Niners need help on their d-line.</p> <h2><strong>32) Kansas City Chiefs</strong></h2> <p><strong>Pick: <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jeremy-chinn?id=32194348-4965-0621-179b-1e6fa9b75e74\">Jeremy Chinn, safety, Southern Illinois</a>.</strong> Running back is tempting for the Super Bowl champions but the smart move would be an upgrade to their defense. Chinn and Tyrann Mathieu could become an imposing tandem at safety.</p> <h2><strong>Sleepers: talented players who may fall down the draft</strong></h2> <p><strong>1) <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/clyde-edwards-helaire?id=32194544-5781-5562-8963-df06e680f700\">Clyde Edwards-Helaire, running back, LSU</a>.</strong> On film Edwards-Helaire looks like a raw Mark Ingram, creative at finding room and an excellent catcher out of the backfield.</p> <p><strong>2) <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/jacob-eason?id=32194541-5338-2386-3401-72035bd47e1c\">Jacob Eason, quarterback, Washington</a>.</strong> New England and Indianapolis are rumoured to be interested in the 6ft 6in passer.</p> <p><strong>3) <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/prospects/cole-kmet?id=32194b4d-4520-0895-f027-61d779beeff4\">Cole Kmet, tight end, Notre Dame</a>.</strong> If a team want a giant receiver who can burst through tackles then Kmet is their guy.</p>",

Trump released national guidelines last week for states to pursue a staggered reopening of their economies once they achieve 14 days of declining new infections \u2013 a criterion that the Peach State has not met.</p> \n<p>Kemp endured widespread ridicule when he admitted, on April Fools\u2019 Day, that he had only just learned that people without symptoms can still spread coronavirus, even though health experts had warned about the possibility for months.</p> \n<p>Georgia now has more more than 21,000 infections and 846 deaths, according to the state department of public health. The state has tested less than 1% of its population for Covid-19, ranking in the bottom 10 per capita and raising fears that it could suffer a resurgence and be forced into another lockdown.</p> \n<p>On Friday, elective medical procedures will resume and barbershops, nail salons and gyms will reopen with restrictions and requirements to stagger shifts and keep workspaces six feet apart. Limited in-restaurant dining will resume next week but bars and nightclubs will remain closed.</p> \n<p>Trump said he had spoken to Kemp, for whom he campaigned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/03/georgia-governor-stacey-abrams-brian-kemp\">against the Democrat Stacey Abrams in 2018</a>, and made his views clear. \u201cThey can wait a little bit longer, just a little bit, not much, because safety has to predominate. We have to have that. So I told the governor very simply that I disagree with his decision but he has to do what he thinks is right.\u201d</p> \n<p>Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, joined the criticism. \u201cIf I were advising the governor, I would tell him that he should be careful,\u201d Fauci said at the briefing. \u201cI would advise him not to just turn the switch on and go, because there is a danger of a rebound.\u201d</p> \n<p>Democrats seized on the president\u2019s remarks. Nikema Williams, the chairwoman for Democratic party of Georgia, said: \u201cYou know it\u2019s a serious failure when Donald Trump, whose failed leadership is responsible for how badly this crisis is hitting America, distances himself from his crony Brian Kemp, who is endlessly determined to make this crisis as painful as possible for Georgians.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump and his experts appeared less in sync, however, on the potential risk of a coronavirus resurgence in the autumn, or fall. First the president falsely claimed that Dr Robert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, had been \u201ctotally misquoted\u201d in a Washington Post article <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/21/coronavirus-second-wave-hydroxychloroquine-trial\">about the danger</a> of the virus in tandem with seasonal flu.</p> \n<p>He then had to look on as Redfield told reporters: \u201cI\u2019m accurately quoted in the Washington Post.\u201d </p> \n<p>Trump shifted gear and objected to the newspaper\u2019s headline, before seeking once again to downplay the threat: \u201cWe will not go through what we went through for the last two months \u2026 And if it comes back, though, it won\u2019t be coming back in the form that it was. It will be coming back in smaller doses that we can contain \u2026 It may not come back at all.\u201d</p> \n<p>Fauci, however, was bluntly realistic: \u201cWe will have coronavirus in the fall. I am convinced of that.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump also announced that he had signed an executive order that will temporarily suspend the issuance of certain green cards for 60 days he said aimed at protecting American jobs. The order includes a long list of exemptions, including for those who are currently in the country, those who have valid immigrant visas, people seeking entry to work as physicians and nurses, and the spouses and unmarried children of US citizens.</p> \n<p>But the American Civil Liberties Union warned that the order will delay the ability of families to reunite and of employers to hire workers necessary to their enterprises. Omar Jadwat, director of its immigrants\u2019 rights project, said: \u201cWhile the order is limited in scope, President Trump\u2019s transparent attempt to distract from his own failures with this unwarranted suspension will cause real pain for families and employers across the country.</p> \n<p>\u201cMeanwhile, he continues to fail to take obvious steps that will save lives \u2013 like releasing people from Ice facilities that cannot keep them safe from Covid-19. We all deserve better leadership than this.\u201d</p> \n<p>In a bizarre riff, Trump also spoke optimistically about staging a 4 July celebration on the National Mall, including an air display. He compared the turnout at last year\u2019s event to the March on Washington in 1963. \u201cI saw a magnificent picture of Dr Martin Luther King and I saw a magnificent picture of our event last year, and both of them were maxed out. It was beautiful to see. Beautiful, very similar. This year, most likely, we\u2019ll be standing six feet apart. We\u2019ll have to do that in a very interesting way.\u201d</p> \n<p>Histories of the Trump presidency are likely to record how he compared the crowd size at his inauguration, also on the National Mall, to that of Barack Obama, even though photos show his predecessor\u2019s was significantly bigger.</p>",

  "<p>Late last week millions of South Koreans queued patiently at polling stations to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/south-korea-votes-in-first-national-election-of-coronavirus-era\">cast their votes for a new national assembly</a>. If any uttered words of frustration from behind their masks, they were out of earshot of their fellow voters, kept at a distance by duct tape marking appropriate intervals.</p> \n<p>As they waited to wash their hands and pull on disposable plastic gloves before entering the booths, some may have allowed themselves to contemplate life beyond exercising their democratic right: an imminent return to work, a round of golf or, at last, a chance to shop for something more indulgent than food and hand sanitiser.</p> \n<p>Going out for dinner, let alone voting in a national election, would have seemed almost inconceivable weeks earlier when the coronavirus threatened to exact the same relentless toll on South Koreans as it has in the US and parts of Europe.</p> \n<p>Long before politicians in Britain accepted that the illness posed a serious threat to public health, South Korea watched the rise in reported daily infections with growing alarm. After the country reported its first case on 20 January, numbers initially remained low before climbing sharply, reaching a peak of 909 daily infections on 29 February.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/archive-zip/giv-3902r1zGcf5CUyu4/\" data-alt=\"Graphic\"> \n <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/04/archive-zip/giv-3902r1zGcf5CUyu4/\">Graphic</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Then something extraordinary happened. The steep rise in cases <a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/south-korea/\">began to plateau</a>. By late March, daily infections were being counted in the dozens, and then in single digits. In the space of a few weeks, South Korea had flattened the curve.</p> \n<p>On Wednesday South Korea reported 11 new Covid-19 cases, the fourth day in a row the number was below 15. That brought the total number of patients to 10,683, more than 8,000 of whom have recovered. With 237 deaths so far, South Korea has <a href=\"https://coronaboard.kr/en/\">one of the lowest</a> Covid-19 case mortality rates in the world, at 2.23%.</p> \n<p>Other countries are now looking to South Korea and its three guiding principles on how to reign in the outbreak: test, trace and contain.</p> \n<p>Perhaps most striking is South Korea\u2019s ability to tame the coronavirus without resorting to lockdowns of the kind imposed in the UK, Italy and France. In contrast to the panic-buying witnessed elsewhere, South Koreans for the most part stayed calm. There were no reports of hoarding, and the only people queuing were waiting to be tested or to buy face masks \u2026 or to vote.</p> \n<p>By the time the World Health Organization issued its plea in mid-March for countries to \u201ctest, test, test\u201d, South Korea had spent weeks <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/covid-19-south-koreans-keep-calm-and-carry-on-testing\">doing just that</a>, quickly developing the capability to test an average of 12,000 people \u2013 and sometimes as many as 20,000 \u2013 a day at hundreds of drive-through and walk-in testing centres. The mobile centres conducted the tests free of charge within 10 minutes, with the results were sent to people\u2019s phones within 24 hours. By mid-March more than 270,000 people had been tested.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"dbabe1a8c06bf55ccf29610577f02f04843fb891\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dbabe1a8c06bf55ccf29610577f02f04843fb891/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Voting in South Korean election\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People in self-isolation cast their ballots after regular voting hours ended in South Korea\u2019s national elections last week.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Testing aside, South Korea \u2013 the most connected country in the world \u2013 also used mobile technology against the outbreak in the form of contact tracing.

Those details enabled the Korea Centres for Disease Control and Prevention to issue alerts, in real time, about where infected people had been before their positive status was confirmed.</p> \n<p>Amid criticism that the system could trample on privacy, the alerts contained only the gender and age category of each infected person, and names and addresses of the places they had visited.</p> \n<p>Jerome Kim, the director general of the International Vaccine Institute in Seoul, said South Korea had contained the virus through \u201cdecisive and transparent leadership based on data, not emotion.\u201d</p> \n<p>Aside from testing people and tracking, isolating and treating those infected, the government convince millions of citizens to alter their behaviour, setting out clear principles for physical distancing, and companies were encouraged to allow employees to work from home.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere was compliance with advisories for social distancing and hygiene, like avoiding bars, churches, gyms and <em>hagwon</em> cram schools,\u201d Kim said. \u201cVoluntary cooperation by an informed populace has been a notable feature of the response.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"15ba1c07-a175-467d-89ed-756d44480b14\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/kRNt8LQRWl4?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/south-korea\">South Korea</a> had already learned a harsh lesson about the cost of delayed action.

The president, Moon Jae-in, has embarked on a campaign of \u201ccoronavirus diplomacy\u201d with other world leaders, and the country has exported test kits to at least 20 nations <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/maryland-coronavirus-tests-south-korea-trump\">including the US</a>.</p> \n<p>The government\u2019s newly released playbook on how to contain the coronavirus, <a href=\"http://www.undp.org/content/seoul_policy_center/en/home/presscenter/articles/2019/flattening-the-curve-on-covid-19.html\">Flattening the curve on Covid-19: the Korean experience</a>, says: \u201cSouth Korea successfully flattened the curve on Covid-19 in 20 days without enforcing extreme draconian measures that restrict freedom and movement of people.\u201d</p> \n<p>While health officials remain cautious for fear of a second wave of infections, life is slowly returning to a version of normality. This week restrictions on shops, restaurants, bars, gyms, cram schools and religious services \u2013 the latter the source of the country\u2019s biggest single outbreak \u2013 were relaxed. National parks, forests and arboretums, which are believed to carry lower risks of infection, are set to open gradually, while physical distancing will remain in place until at least early May.</p> \n<p>\u201cUntil we reach herd immunity or we achieve similar levels with a safe and effective vaccine, the new normal, with a stress on hygiene, social distancing and potentially local crackdowns, may continue,\u201d said Kim.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"50c40e05fbe4011060ba358b8991c4458ab1c045\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/50c40e05fbe4011060ba358b8991c4458ab1c045/0_0_2560_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man speaks to a nurse at a testing booth outside Yangji hospital in Seoul\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man speaks to a nurse at a testing booth outside Yangji hospital in Seoul.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Composite: Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The ruling party\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/south-koreas-ruling-party-wins-election-landslide-amid-coronavirus-outbreak\">comfortable victory</a> in last week\u2019s national assembly elections has been interpreted as popular approval of the government\u2019s handling of the crisis.

There was evidence of that in Seoul this week where people were returning to work and flocking to shopping malls and restaurants.</p> \n<p>For Kim Tae-hyung, a 31-year-old engineer from Seoul, the cautious embrace of a post-pandemic world meant once again playing the game he loves.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019m a member of a community football club and we went out to play on Saturday for the first time in two months,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were wearing masks while we played, and we were still worried about the coronavirus.

My heart hurts more than my head over his infection. This virus does not discriminate. While kids are more resilient, they can suffer same severity of symptoms. I\u2019m applying a modified version of my remedies for his protocol with a focus on lots of vitamins. Since his sense of smell and taste have disappeared, I am feeding him healthy foods that I normally can\u2019t get him to touch. I kept a diary of the past week including my remedies and things that I did to stay sane through it all. \ud83d\ude4f Link in bio, as they say.</a></p> <p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;>A post shared by <a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/cristinacuomo/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=loading&quot; style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px;&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;> Cristina Cuomo</a> (@cristinacuomo) on <time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2020-04-22T17:41:41+00:00&quot;>Apr 22, 2020 at 10:41am PDT</time></p></div></blockquote> <script async src=&quot;//www.instagram.com/embed.js&quot;></script></body></html>\"></iframe> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea0d82b8f0898fe360d660a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-22T23:50:19.249Z\">12.50am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>That briefing has now ended.
