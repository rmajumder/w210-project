How much worse the situation is compared with the usual numbers of people who die in normal circumstances has been a subject of some debate in some sections of the media, and particularly on social media. </p> \n  <p>A blogpost by David Shaw, a senior research fellow at the Institute for Biomedical Ethics, University of Basel, posted on the British Medical Journal provides some much-needed context. Shaw identifies four important contextual factors that should be borne in mind to understand reports of death tolls that make headlines in the daily press. For example, he writes: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>[I]n all the millions of words written about how many people have died in each country each day, no coverage appears to have given the baseline daily death rate before the outbreak began. Take Scotland: here, the death rate had averaged between 6 and 8 people per day before increasing to 16 on the 1<sup>st</sup> of April. But the <a href=\"https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/files/statistics/vital-events-ref-tables/2018/vital-events-ref-tables-18-publication.pdf\">typical death rate in Scotland</a> is 160 people per day, with about a quarter of them dying of cancer. This means that the virus is currently increasing the daily rate by 10% (and before that around 5%) \u2013 a substantial increase, but not as massive as many members of the public are probably assuming, given the press coverage. Reporting the increasing number of deaths in isolation without this context is likely to increase people\u2019s stress about the virus, because people are unaware of how many people normally die each day. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><a href=\"https://blogs.bmj.com/medical-ethics/2020/04/02/the-vital-contexts-of-coronavirus/\">Read more on the BMJ website: The vital contexts of coronavirus.</a></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-07T15:45:04.925Z\">at 4.45pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8c99548f08ec70cecec420\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-07T15:18:59.356Z\">4.18pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>More people have now died from the coronavirus in New York City than perished in the September 11 attack on the World Trade Center, the <strong>Associated Press</strong> reports.<br></p> \n  <p> At least 3,202 people in the city have been killed by the virus, according to the latest figures released on Tuesday.

  "<p>It was as a direct result of a newspaper article by the former Labour MP Joe Ashton, who has died aged 86, that a compulsory register of MPs\u2019 financial interests outside Westminster was first established by the House of Commons in 1974. Ashton had called for the creation of such a register in a column he wrote for the party newspaper, Labour Weekly, under the heading MPs for Hire, and two weeks after its publication the newly elected Labour government took the first steps to seek to control political corruption.</p> <p>The February 1974 general election had been held in the middle of a scandal involving the builder John Poulson, a man with many political contacts who had been imprisoned for using bribery to win lucrative public sector contracts. Labour had campaigned on a manifesto promising a compulsory register that might prevent a repeat, and Ashton had been prompted to write his article in April 1974 by a report in the Guardian suggesting that the new prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/1995/may/25/obituaries\">Harold Wilson</a>, was preparing to resile from that commitment in favour of a regime of voluntary declarations of interest.</p> <p>Ashton was subsequently found (by a formal inquiry of the Commons\u2019 Committee of Privileges) to have committed a serious contempt of parliament for suggesting, in his article, that MPs were available for hire. He was obliged to apologise for being what he himself called \u201ca brave, mad whistleblower\u201d, yet it was because of the political uproar his column caused that Wilson was obliged to act so swiftly after his general election win.</p> <p>Ashton was a Yorkshireman who had a background of poverty and an instinctive populist sense of what mattered to his working-class constituents and to the Labour electorate. He was blessed with articulacy, had the ability to turn a colourful phrase and possessed a common touch \u2013 all attributes that took him into parliament and made him a punchy, popular newspaper columnist. He was an immensely active constituency MP for 33 years, but failed to progress at Westminster because of a lack of judgment that sometimes antagonised his parliamentary colleagues. He was also part of the unlucky generation of Labour MPs whose prime years at Westminster coincided with 18 years of uninterrupted Conservative government.</p> <p>Born in the slums of Attercliffe in Sheffield to teenage parents, Arthur (known as Ike) Ashton and Nellie (nee Maloney), Joe was named after an uncle who had been killed at the age of four by a runaway steamroller. His father was intermittently unemployed, although he did stand-in shifts at the local Nunnery pit and later found work in the city\u2019s steel industry. His mother was a \u201cbuffer girl\u201d, polishing nickel-plated silver cutlery. Joe passed the 11-plus to attend High Storrs grammar school, but never wore the uniform his family could not afford, something his parents were successfully advised to blame on the lack of clothing coupons under wartime rationing. At 16 he became an engineering apprentice at Rotherham Technical College and joined the Labour party.</p> <p>In 1954 he did two years\u2019 national service in the RAF, taking part in the ill-fated Suez invasion before returning to a white-collar job as a design engineer, a post he held until narrowly winning a difficult byelection in Bassetlaw in 1968. The constituency, situated in the Nottinghamshire coalfield, was at the time facing pit closures imposed by an unpopular Labour government, and Ashton\u2019s majority was reduced to 1.72%. A traditionally safe Labour \u201cred wall\u201d seat until lost to the Conservatives in December 2019, it was held by Ashton with a 36.4% majority at his last election in 1997.</p> <p>He learned politics as a shop steward and as a member of Sheffield city council from 1962 until 1969. When first elected, he was the youngest member of the council, succeeding Roy Hattersley in that distinction. Hattersley would later write, in an affectionate and forthright foreword to Ashton\u2019s first book of memoirs, Red Rose Blues (2000), that what he most admired about the author was his \u201cabsolute lack of discretion\u201d and his inability ever to moderate his support or antagonism for any cause.</p> <p>Such full-hearted enthusiasm was immediately evident at Westminster, where Ashton busily embarked on various backbench campaigns and established a high public profile as a national newspaper columnist, including briefly for the Guardian. He was parliamentary private secretary (PPS) to the sports minister Denis Howell (1969-70) and after Labour\u2019s return to government did the same job for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/mar/14/tony-benn-obituary\">Tony Benn</a> as secretary of state for industry and then energy. He was a strong leftwing supporter of Benn, encouraging him to fight Wilson as prime minister \u2013 \u201cget into the ring like Cassius Clay and knock him out,\u201d he advised Benn in 1975 \u2013 and although he was sacked as PPS for rebelling against the government in early 1976 he continued to do the job informally. He ran Benn\u2019s campaign for the Labour leadership when Wilson unexpectedly resigned in the spring of 1976, and was surprised to be appointed as an assistant whip by the new prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/mar/28/guardianobituaries.politics\">James Callaghan</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ab705d4697e4d4f9812da0d2c081582104bf2f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1ab705d4697e4d4f9812da0d2c081582104bf2f9/31_61_4594_2757/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Ashton with the cast of his play A Majority of One, 1981.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Ashton with the cast of his play A Majority of One, 1981.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pete Lomas/ANL/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He lasted only a year in the whips\u2019 office, but it was sufficient to provide material for a stage play based on the knife-edge existence of the Callaghan government. The play, A Majority of One, was well received after performances in Oldham and Nottingham in 1981; Ashton was fond of claiming that it was the inspiration for James Graham\u2019s This House at the National Theatre 30 years later. During this period he published a political novel, Grass Roots (1977), which also garnered good reviews.</p> <p>He fell out with Benn over the latter\u2019s campaigns to introduce internal constitutional reforms within the Labour party, and thereafter became increasingly antagonistic both towards Benn and the party\u2019s leftwing. He told a fellow Labour whip that he had explained to Benn: \u201cThe trouble with you, Tony, is you think the working class are noble savages when in fact there are just as many shits among the working class as anywhere else.\u201d He criticised plans for mandatory reselection of MPs at successive party conferences and was slow-handclapped in 1980 when he warned that reselection could hasten defections to a breakaway party, as indeed happened when the SDP was launched the following year.</p> <p>Ashton spent two years on the opposition frontbench as an energy spokesman from 1979. Thereafter he returned to the backbenches and sat on various select committees: trade and industry (1987-92), home affairs (1989-92), national heritage (1992-97) and on the select committee charged with modernising the House of Commons (1997-98). He chaired the all-party football committee from 1992 until he retired at the 2001 election, and was a passionate supporter of Sheffield Wednesday football club, of which he was a director from 1990 to 1999.</p> <p>In 1998 Ashton was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/mar/16/michaelwhite\">on the premises of a Thai massage parlour</a> in Northampton during a police raid for suspected immigration offences. The following year it was disclosed that he had been questioned by police, although he had committed no offence. He wrote later in his memoirs that he had acted on a \u201ccrazy impulse\u201d. The chapter was entitled All Political Careers End in Tears. In retirement he founded the Association for Former Members of Parliament in 2001. He also published a second book of Sheffield memoirs, Joe Blow \u2013 his childhood nickname \u2013 in 2014, and donated the proceeds to the Salvation Army. He was appointed OBE in 2007.</p> <p>He married Margaret (Maggie) Lee, a former secretary at the Sheffield Brightside and Carbrook Co-operative Society coal depot, in 1957. She died in 2014 and he is survived by their daughter, Lucy.</p> <p>\u2022 Joseph William Ashton, politician, born 9 October 1933; died 30 March 2020</p>",
  "<h2>Stephen Colbert</h2> <p>It\u2019s week four of the pandemic shutdown in the US, said Stephen Colbert on Monday night\u2019s \u201cA Late Show\u201d from his home in New Jersey, and \u201cgovernment officials and health experts are warning that this is going to be the toughest week yet of the coronavirus. A lot of Americans are going to get this, and some of them are going to die. And I hope you know that you and your families are in our thoughts, and if you want them, you\u2019re in my prayers,\u201d Colbert said. \u201cBut I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s not why you tuned in tonight \u2013 you\u2019re here for the jokes.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAW3qHG4_ZY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LAW3qHG4_ZY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u201cSo, here we go,\u201d he said, diving into a monologue on Trump\u2019s delusional optimism, though Colbert was slightly less rosy on how America is doing; after months of advising Americans not to wear masks, the CDC announced this weekend that all Americans should wear cloth or fabric face coverings when they go out in public. \u201cWe were supposed to be covering our faces this whole time? Oh my God, Billy Porter tried to warn us!\u201d Colbert said, referencing Porter\u2019s infamous retractable face shield at the 2020 Grammys.</p> <p>\u201cGiven the sudden reversal, this new guidance is a little confusing, but on Friday, the president used his daily briefing to make it even more confusing,\u201d Colbert continued. At a press briefing, Trump called the CDC recommendation \u201cvoluntary\u201d and said that he wouldn\u2019t follow it because he didn\u2019t want to wear a mask. \u201cWell of course Trump is the guy who says he doesn\u2019t want to wear protection,\u201d said Colbert, imitating Trump: \u201cMasks are just the condom of the face \u2013 it kills all the feeling. I mean, there\u2019s a reason I don\u2019t wear a raincoat in the shower or a condom during sex.\u201d</p> <h2>Seth Meyers</h2> <p>On Late Night, Seth Meyers turned his Closer Look segment on Trump\u2019s erroneous and irresponsible claims over the past month that the coronavirus would just disappear with warmer weather in April. Asked about this baseless talking point this weekend, in April, Trump dialed down, telling reporters: \u201cI didn\u2019t say a date, I said it\u2019s going away, and it is going away.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TX4fW1dD4E\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2TX4fW1dD4E?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u201cAh, very clever,\u201d Meyers responded. \u201cAfter all, April has 24 days left, and it\u2019s down to, what, I don\u2019t know, 337,000 cases?\u201d Meyers said. (That number has, of course, gone up.) \u201cAnd you did \u2013 you literally said \u2018it goes away in April.\u2019 That\u2019s as close to specific as Trump ever gets. Usually, when you ask him a question, he waves it away like a dad promising his kids a trip to Disneyland while watching football.\u201d</p> <p>Meyers also criticized Trump\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, for his mishandling of the federal stockpile of ventilators. Meyers described Kushner as \u201ceverybody\u2019s favorite botoxed nine-year-old\u201d, and \u201cthe real-life Jack Skellington, the fellow who\u2019s always lurking in the background of every White House photo like a stalker who suddenly appears in the mirror when you close your medicine cabinet.

It\u2019s not supposed to be states\u2019 stockpiles that they then use.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThat makes sense,\u201d Meyers deadpanned of Kushner\u2019s argument. \u201cIt\u2019s like my doorman told me: \u2018The front door belongs to the building. If you wanna go to work so bad, climb down the fire escape.\u2019 Seriously, it\u2019s <em>your</em> stockpile? Are you writing your name on them like you\u2019re leaving your lunch in the office fridge?</p> <p>\u201cThis sniveling weasel thinks everything belongs to him because he was born into a rich family, just like his father-in-law,\u201d Meyer continued. \u201cI\u2019m shocked we haven\u2019t seen something called a Kushni-lator pop up on Craigslist.\u201d</p> <p>It all leads to one conclusion, according to Meyers: \u201cOne lesson we\u2019re all learning from this is that, generally speaking, it\u2019s better to not be governed by sociopaths.\u201d</p> <h2>Trevor Noah</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1247345214978772996\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Would Trump be more open to wearing a mask if we told him it\u2019s a border wall for your face? <a href=\"https://t.co/DymBKHyhf7\">pic.twitter.com/DymBKHyhf7</a></p>&mdash; The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1247345214978772996?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 7, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>On the Daily Social Distancing Show, Trevor Noah addressed Trump\u2019s unproven and dangerous claim that hydroxychloroquine could treat coronavirus. \u201cHere\u2019s what I don\u2019t get: Trump is acknowledging he\u2019s not a doctor, while legitimate doctors who could answer these questions are standing right there next to him,\u201d Noah said. \u201cWhy are we getting his opinion at all? Imagine if you went in for a check-up, and there\u2019s just some random dude behind the counter giving his opinion.</p> <p>\u201cNow, before you get depressed by the fact that America is being led by someone who knows less about medicine than Dr Pepper, there is still a lot of good news out there,\u201d he continued.

It turns out that changing the rules that dictate our daily financial agreements <em>is</em> possible after all, and can happen with remarkable speed. The challenge moving forward is ensuring that some of these changes stick. This crisis offers a chance to not just hit the pause button and offer temporary relief for those who are in distress, but to permanently change the rules so that untold millions of people aren\u2019t so vulnerable to begin with.</p> <p>Completely eliminating student debt would be a good place to start. All federal student debt can be erased in an instant using authority Congress has already vested in the Department of Education. But it will take a movement to push public officials to actually do it.</p> <p>We can\u2019t repeat the mistakes of 2008, when the bank bailout program left the financial sector stronger than ever while millions of families lost their homes and jobs.

We can\u2019t afford to let our leaders make the same mistakes again.</p> <p>Biden\u2019s track record on student debt offers another indication that he is ill-equipped to meet the moment. Consider, for example, the fact that Obama blocked tens of thousands of defrauded for-profit college borrowers who were legally entitled to relief, leaving them at the mercy of Trump\u2019s secretary of education, Betsy DeVos. They also ignored the activists who pleaded with them to stop social security garnishment on the growing number of senior citizens in default on their student loans.</p> <p>Biden\u2019s higher education platform is a hodge-podge of measures including increased grant funding, some adjustments to income-based repayments and public service loan forgiveness, and to allow those with private student debt to discharge their debt in bankruptcy\u2013in other words, undoing the very 2005 bill <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/02/joe-biden-student-loan-debt-2005-act-2020\">he fought long and hard to pass</a>. Since then the nation\u2019s total student loan burden has spiked from approximately $500m to over $1.7tn. Recently, in an attempt to appeal to younger voters, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1239280175826731010?s=20\">Biden has boasted</a> about having adopted aspects of Sanders\u2019 higher education plan, but his proposals still pale in comparison to those of the senator from Vermont.</p> <p>Even under normal circumstances, Biden\u2019s half-measures would be inadequate. But at a time when the economy is going haywire and life is about to get much more difficult for poor and working people, they are unconscionable.</p> <p>Just as they did after 2008, working people need and are entitled to assistance \u2013 including, but not limited to, student debt relief. Public officials should cancel all student debt immediately. Every cancelled payment would turn into cash used to purchase things like rent and food instead. Research shows that eliminating all student debt could <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/06/27/opinions/cancel-college-debt-smarter-richer-taylor/index.html\">potentially boost GDP</a> by an estimated $108bn a year for 10 years. That\u2019s one reason calls to pause collection or fiddle with interest aren\u2019t enough. Everyone will <a href=\"https://ourfinancialsecurity.org/2020/03/factsheet-cancel-federal-student-loans-to-provide-short-and-long-term-stimulus-amid-pandemic/\">benefit from the economic stimulus</a> provided by a full jubilee, not only the approximately 45 million borrowers who would see their balances disappear. Now that\u2019s a bailout regular people can get behind.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The vast majority of Americans should demand debt relief as an essential part of a sane response to the coming downturn</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Unfortunately, most politicians rarely do the right thing of their own accord. That\u2019s why <a href=\"http://www.debtcollective.org/\">the Debt Collective</a>, a union for debtors I helped found, has launched a <a href=\"https://strike.debtcollective.org/\">scaled-up student debt strike</a> to push for a full jubilee. Over half of all student debtors are already not paying their loans in one form or another (because they already defaulted, are in forbearance or deferral, or because their income level lets them lower their payments to $0 a month) and many more will be unable to pay next month. Instead of struggling alone and being ashamed, debtors need to come out of the shadows and declare themselves on strike.</p> <p>Corporate interests are well organized and have secured trillions of dollars of no-strings-attached public money for their efforts. The vast majority of Americans are indebted, and they should make their voices heard, demanding debt relief as an essential part of a sane and just response to the coming downturn.</p> <p>We must recognize that the coronavirus outbreak is a dual crisis. It is a biological and medical emergency that exposes a deeper political and economic disaster. For millions of Americans, life was difficult even before the disease hit and now things are untenable. With jobs and income lost people will take on more debt, and huge numbers will spiral into default.</p> <p>Ultimately, we need way more than debt write-downs or even debt abolition to heal what ails us. We need to rewrite the rules of the economy so that people don\u2019t have to live in perpetual financial peril. The vast majority of working people are not indebted because they live beyond their means, but because they are denied the means to live. The case for things such as paid sick leave, universal healthcare, guaranteed housing, a public banking system, cross border-cooperation and debt abolition has never been stronger.</p> <p>These days, the words \u201ccrisis\u201d and \u201capocalyptic\u201d couldn\u2019t be more apt. The first term comes from the ancient Greek and means the turning point in an illness \u2013 death or recovery, two stark alternatives. The root of \u201capocalypse\u201d means to reveal or uncover. This is the truth this apocalyptic moment unveils: to truly cure ourselves and survive this crisis we are going to need way more than a vaccine. We need to think big and completely transform our economy from the ground up, prioritizing public welfare and ecological stability over private profit, before the next big disaster hits.</p> <ul> <li><p>Astra Taylor is the author of Democracy May Not Exist, but We\u2019ll Miss It When It\u2019s Gone, an organizer with the Debt Collective, and the Puffin Foundation/Economic Hardship Reporting Project fellow</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p> Joe Biden was not their <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/entrance-and-exit-polls/california/democratic\">first choice.</a> In some cases, he wasn\u2019t even their <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/state/nevada\">second</a> or <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/state/iowa\">third</a>. Now, as the all-but-certain nominee, Biden is aggressively courting a critical constituency of younger and leftwing Democrats who have so far rejected his presidential bid.</p> <p>Last month, Biden stitched together a wide range of support from African Americans, suburbanites and working-class white voters to rack up wins across the country and amass an almost indomitable lead over his rival, democratic socialist senator Bernie Sanders. Yet missing from that coalition is the young and more liberal voters who overwhelmingly prefer Sanders\u2019 call for political revolution to Biden\u2019s promise of a return to \u201cnormalcy\u201d.</p> <p>Determined not to repeat the mistakes of 2016, when the party struggled to unify after a divisive primary battle that stretched into the summer convention, Biden is now amplifying his appeals to the party\u2019s left.</p> <p>According to campaign officials, his team has for weeks quietly engaged top progressive organizations and movement leaders representing a range of Democratic causes from climate change to racial justice. The effort, spearheaded by senior Biden advisers, includes outreach to legacy organizations such as Planned Parenthood as well as newer, youth-led groups like the Sunrise Movement.</p> <p>Biden has also made overt gestures. He recently adopted a plan by his former rival, Elizabeth Warren, to overhaul the consumer bankruptcy system and embraced elements of Sanders\u2019 tuition-free college proposal.</p> <p>\u201cLet me say, especially to the young voters who have been inspired by senator Sanders: I hear you,\u201d Biden said after sweeping three major primary contests last month. \u201cI know what is at stake. And I know what we have to do.\u201d</p> <p>There is a delicacy around the engagement, especially with Sanders still claiming his campaign has a \u201cnarrow path\u201d to the nomination despite calls to bow out of the race. The left came tantalizing close to nominating a presidential candidate they hold up as a progressive champion only to watch in dismay as Biden, who is unquestionably more moderate, all-but vanquished those hopes, and with startling speed.</p> <p>There is a mutual understanding that the party must unify to defeat Donald Trump in November. But progressives also believe they have built sufficient leverage to press for sweeping policy concessions from Biden, particularly given the potentially worrisome <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-consolidates-support-trails-badly-enthusiasm-poll/story?id=69812092\">lack of enthusiasm</a> for his candidacy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ddfa99eed81e26204158c3c340e4fa2f16f1c60a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ddfa99eed81e26204158c3c340e4fa2f16f1c60a/0_36_2918_1751/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Democratic US presidential candidates Senator Bernie Sanders and former vice-president Joe Biden at the 11th Democratic candidates debate in Washington on 15 March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Democratic US presidential candidates Senator Bernie Sanders and former vice-president Joe Biden at the 11th Democratic candidates debate in Washington on 15 March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cJoe Biden, as the moderate frontrunner, has to convince progressives to support him,\u201d said Julian Brave NoiseCat, who directs Green New Deal strategy at the progressive think tank Data for Progress. \u201cHe needs more enthusiasm behind his campaign, and it\u2019s been a bruising campaign cycle.\u201d</p> <p>In interviews with progressive organizers, climate change has emerged as a key area where activists believe they can \u201cpush\u201d the former vice-president, in part because combatting global warming draws broad support from every corner of the party. Several <a href=\"https://www.people-press.org/2020/02/13/as-economic-concerns-recede-environmental-protection-rises-on-the-publics-policy-agenda/\">polls</a> this cycle have found that Democratic voters rank climate change among their top three issues, often second only to healthcare.</p> <p>Data for Progress, along with climate staff from Washington governor Jay Inslee\u2019s former presidential campaign, are among those urging the Biden team to prioritize climate change.</p> <p>In a recent six-page memo, the group laid out five policy areas where he could issue new proposals or emphasize existing ones. They are: stronger clean energy standards with clearer targets, investments in green infrastructure, a dedicated 40% of climate money going to disadvantaged communities, restrictions on Wall Street financing of fossil fuels and a commitment to high-quality union jobs. NoiseCat said the Biden campaign is engaging the authors at a high level.</p> <p>Some progressives believe Biden, who spent decades in the Senate before serving as vice president, would have a better shot at moving climate legislation through Congress because of his longstanding relationships and pragmatic approach. Biden also has strong ties to labor unions that are <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2019/5/22/18628299/green-new-deal-labor-union-2020-democrats\">skeptical</a> of ambitious proposals to tackle climate change.</p> <p>Already Biden has suggested Democrats should push for \u201cGreen Deal\u201d spending in the next aid package responding to the economic downturn spurred by the coronavirus pandemic. Though he is unlikely to endorse policies to significantly curb drilling for oil and natural gas \u2013 like a fracking ban \u2013 which could alienate supporters in swing states like Pennsylvania.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot more that can be done to have the full-scale mobilization of the federal government that is needed to defeat climate change,\u201d said Jamal Raad, former aide to Inslee\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign. \u201cThat\u2019s the task at hand here for the next president.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b079b23e74cfb602451d78bb9601d9ebba060775\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b079b23e74cfb602451d78bb9601d9ebba060775/0_0_4392_2928/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Biden speaks during a campaign rally at Renaissance High School in Detroit.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Biden speaks during a campaign rally at Renaissance High School in Detroit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Progressive activists say their overriding priority in 2020 is to defeat Trump. But they warn that antipathy for the president is not enough to win in November. And how Biden engages the left and what concessions he is willing to make could determine the nature of their electoral efforts on his behalf.</p> <p>\u201cWill enough people be willing to volunteer for the nominee? Or send text messages for the nominee? Or overcome the barriers of voter suppression that we know are coming to vote for the nominee,\u201d said Jennifer Epps-Addison, the network director at the Center for Popular Democracy, which endorsed Sanders. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s at stake.\u201d</p> <p>Epps-Addison echoed many Democratic activists in urging Biden to put a progressive standard-bearer on the ticket with him. Biden has said he would choose a woman as his running mate, an overture to Democrats deeply disappointed that two white men in their 70s emerged from a historically diverse and female presidential field.</p> <p>Both Democratic contenders have vowed to actively support whoever becomes the party\u2019s nominee.</p> <p>Yet Biden, confined to his home in Delaware amid the coronavirus outbreak, has so far struggled to re-create the grassroots excitement that has powered Sanders\u2019 presidential bid, with packed rallies and an endless stream of small-dollar donations. Meanwhile, Sanders has continued to criticize his opponent\u2019s record.</p> <p>Asked during the last Democratic debate how he might appeal to Sanders\u2019 supporters if he became the nominee, Biden quipped: \u201cHe\u2019s making it hard for me right now.\u201d</p> <p>Though Sanders\u2019 chances of clinching the nomination have faded, the progressive proposals he championed on healthcare, climate change and student debt remain widely popular among Democratic voters \u2013 a point the senator has made explicitly as he defends his continued presence in the primary race. His ideas, the senator has asserted, are winning the \u201cideological\u201d and \u201cgenerational\u201d debate\u201d \u2013 even if he is not.</p> <p>Biden may be the eventual nominee, said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which endorsed Warren, but \u201ctens of millions of people who supported Warren and Sanders nonetheless wanted a president who advocated for bold, progressive policy ideas.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b2f597d7003396166e97b1512b3bf3da1527dbbb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b2f597d7003396166e97b1512b3bf3da1527dbbb/0_0_6192_4128/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Joe Biden addresses the media and a small group of supporters with his wife Dr Jill Biden during a primary night event on 10 March in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Biden addresses the media and a small group of supporters with his wife Dr Jill Biden during a primary night event on 10 March in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Makela/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Alexis Confer, executive director of March For Our Lives, which was founded by survivors of the Parkland high school shooting in Florida, said the best way for Biden to reach young voters is to address their priorities with a shared sense of urgency.</p> <p>\u201cWe see our daily work as fighting the largest epidemic in our country,\u201d Confer said, referring to the scourge of gun violence that <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/08/16/what-the-data-says-about-gun-deaths-in-the-u-s/\">claims</a> more than 36,000 American lives each year. But they also view their activism as part of a wider movement for social, racial and economic justice, she added, emphasizing that \u201cpeople don\u2019t live single-issue lives.\u201d</p> <p>In discussions with Biden\u2019s team, March for Our Lives is advocating for a 10-day waiting period on all firearm purchases, a federal gun licensing program and the creation of an administration role dedicated to combating gun violence.</p> <p>Pro-choice organizations are also eager to see Biden elevate his support for reproductive rights, especially in light of <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2020-04-02/red-states-block-abortion-coronavirus-outbreak\">efforts</a> in conservative states to restrict abortions during the pandemic.<br><br>Early in the primary season, Biden <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/06/abortion-joe-biden-hyde-amendment\">abandoned</a> his support for the Hyde Amendment, which bans the use of federal funds for abortion with some exceptions. But he has a shifting voting record on the issue and some advocates have called on him to release a standalone plan outlining his commitment to defending reproductive rights.<br><br>\u201cVoters need to know that addressing this crisis is top of mind for our next president and that our nominee understands that reproductive freedom is fundamental to achieving meaningful equity in society,\u201d NARAL President Ilyse Hogue said in a statement.</p> <p>Immigration is a particularly thorny issue for Biden. Throughout the primary season, he has faced fierce criticism from immigration activists over the Obama administration\u2019s deportation policy, which resulted in the removal of roughly three million people. At campaign events and even during Democratic debates, Biden was met with protests and interruptions from activists shouting: \u201cNot one more deportation.\u201d</p> <p>Cristina Jim\u00e9nez, executive director of United We Dream Action, a youth-led immigrant rights network, said Biden has work to do to \u201cbridge the trust gap\u201d with Latino voters, a powerful Democratic constituency that tends to be younger. In the primary, many of these voters flocked to Sanders, who proposed a sweeping overhaul of the nation\u2019s immigration system.</p> <p>Her group, which jointly endorsed Sanders and Warren, expects to meet with Biden\u2019s team in the coming weeks. In those discussions, they intend to press him to commit to using executive authority to expand programs like Daca, which shields certain immigrants from deportation and to repeal a 1996 law that increased penalties for crossing the border illegally.</p> <p>Biden has acknowledged the \u201cincredible pain\u201d caused by deportation and recently pledged to halt nearly all removals in the first 100 days of his administration, a move activists believes is a testament to their advocacy.</p> <p>Still, many progressives remain skeptical.</p> <p>\u201cRight now it still feels like more of the same,\u201d said Erika Andiola, chief advocacy officer at the immigration services organization Raices Action and a former staffer on Sanders\u2019 2016 campaign. \u201cThat\u2019s why we have to keep pushing him.\u201d</p> <p>In a virtual fundraiser on Friday, Biden was optimistic that he could find common ground with the Democrats most leery of his campaign in time to bring the party together in November.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of good ideas they have \u2013 I disagree with many of them,\u201d Biden said. But he continued: \u201cThere\u2019s lot of significant change that can take place \u2013 both structurally and practically \u2013 that can bring everybody along.\u201d</p>",

It was busy in the park \u2013 but this is a densely populated area, home to tens of thousands of people, many of whom have no outside living space. I saw no large groups; I remember seeing one group of three teenagers and noting that everyone else was on their own or in pairs, or parents with young children.</p> \n   <p> Some people were sitting on the grass or on benches but at a distance from others. Most people were on the move and many were visibly taking care to stay away from other people as best as they could. It can be difficult to stay two metres away from other people at all times in a busy park. No one that I saw was gratuitously ignoring social distancing guidance.</p> \n   <p>Closing parks would in my view be appallingly damaging to people\u2019s physical and mental health at a time when they are dealing with unprecedented strain and anxiety. It will force people into smaller open spaces or on to roads where it will be harder to practise social distancing. If there is an irresponsible minority \u2013 and I didn\u2019t see them \u2013 surely they should be spoken to, asked to change their behaviour and then if necessary sanctioned. Why should the responsible majority suffer? </p> \n   <p>Perhaps more could be done to promote responsible use of parks. This is very important because we don\u2019t want to get into a situation where urban populations can no longer tolerate the lockdown.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Another reader, who did not want to be named, said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I live in a small flat with no garden and walked to the park with my husband and baby. I ran around the park while my husband let our baby crawl on the grass. I saw no large groups, many people exercising, and everyone I encountered was assiduously respecting two-metre distance. There were some people sitting on the grass alone or in household or family groups. I was doing some stretches at the end of my run while our child crawled and we were moved on by a policeman who came within two metres of us. He said that while it was allowed for us to accompany our child crawling he wanted us to move on to set an example, which we did.</p> \n   <p>As a local resident I believe that during challenging times green spaces provide a vital source of well-being and psychological resilience. Local authorities and the police must not let a few people sitting on the grass in household groups \u2013 which, let\u2019s be honest, carries extremely low risk of Covid transmission \u2013 to prevent people from exercising in the fresh air.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-06T13:21:37.148Z\">at 2.21pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8b20c88f080bdb9f535190\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-06T12:33:13.072Z\">1.33pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Labour MP in hospital with coronavirus</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b87be1c51acf8df3442bc94a678aaf0aeac8e2e\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b87be1c51acf8df3442bc94a678aaf0aeac8e2e/0_117_3500_2100/1000..jpg\" alt=\"Tony Lloyd\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Lloyd.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Liam McBurney/PA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p><strong>Tony Lloyd</strong>, 70, the Labour MP for Rochdale, has been taken to hospital in Manchester with coronavirus, ITV\u2019s Hannah Miller reports.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/hannahITV/status/1247133928223313923\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Rochdale MP Tony Lloyd has been hospitalised in Manchester Royal Infirmary with coronavirus.<br><br>Labour Party say 'he is stable and responding to the treatment and dedicated care that he is receiving from the brilliant doctors, nurses and other healthcare staff.' <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GranadaReports?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@GranadaReports</a></p>\u2014 Hannah Miller (@hannahITV) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hannahITV/status/1247133928223313923?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 6, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Lloyd is still the shadow Northern Ireland secretary. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/columeastwood/status/1247139710188879874\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Wishing my good friend <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tony4rochdale?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@tony4rochdale</a> Tony Lloyd a full and fast recovery.</p>\u2014 Colum Eastwood (@columeastwood) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/columeastwood/status/1247139710188879874?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 6, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-06T12:47:06.286Z\">at 1.47pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8b20198f080bdb9f53517d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/stevenmorris\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-06T12:28:40.377Z\">1.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"05b0da8947e62b3585bd9d6d3ac63972649bcaa7\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/05b0da8947e62b3585bd9d6d3ac63972649bcaa7/0_50_3000_1800/1000..jpg\" alt=\"The testing centre being prepared at Cardiff City Stadium\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The testing centre being prepared at Cardiff City Stadium.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Evans/Huw Evans/Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>A Covid-19 testing centre at Cardiff City\u2019s stadium is due to open on Tuesday.

However, as the pandemic forces the closure of export and import markets, UK fishers are left with huge volumes of seafood which UK consumers might often overlook.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-06T09:58:12.935Z\">at 10.58am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8af7648f08c35a1d11ab56\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-06T09:41:07.195Z\">10.41am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Debenhams prepares to bring in administrators</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Debenhams said it has the support of its lenders to enter administration and is engaging with employees and suppliers over the move.</p> \n  <p>Business live has more: </p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/apr/06/stock-markets-gain-coronavirus-covid-19-lockdowns-disease-ftse-pound-oil-price-business-live\">British construction endures worst decline since 2009 as Covid-19 hits \u2013 business live</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8af80a8f08c9eaf0daf3b3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-06T09:40:05.666Z\">10.40am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A man has been arrested following threats to a police community support officer conducting social distancing enforcement patrols, PA Media reports. </p> \n  <p>South Yorkshire police said the arrest was made at the weekend as officers responded to reports of flouting of the regulations in the Fir Vale area of Sheffield.</p> \n  <p>Officers said they enlisted a university student to help them explain the regulations and the seriousness of situation to members of the Roma community in the area.</p> \n  <p>Pictures were posted on social media apparently showing people congregating in groups on the terraced streets of that part of the city.</p> \n  <p>Sheffield North-East Neighbourhood Policing Team said on Facebook on Sunday: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Tonight a member of the Roma community who is studying at university has been on patrol with officers to try and assist with educating and explaining the seriousness of the situation the country is facing.<br></p> \n   <p>Yesterday a male was arrested and charged with public order offences having threatened the PCSO conducting enforcement patrols.</p> \n   <p>The team have seen a steady improvement on compliance in the area however there is still progress to be made.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Facebook police Sheffield\"> \n   <iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FSheffieldNENHP%2Fposts%2F3851411038232373&amp;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"838\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allow=\"encrypted-media\"></iframe> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-06T11:06:04.296Z\">at 12.06pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8af67c8f08c9eaf0daf397\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-06T09:29:36.610Z\">10.29am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/06/coronavirus-uk-how-many-confirmed-cases-are-in-your-area\">Coronavirus UK: how many confirmed cases are in your area?</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-06T09:29:43.973Z\">at 10.29am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8af4188f080bdb9f534ee8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-06T09:24:35.319Z\">10.24am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Times says Johnson is being treated in the <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/coronavirus-boris-johnson-taken-to-hospital-over-persistent-symptoms-b2xsbg9hs\">nearest NHS hospital to Downing Street</a> \u2013 Guys and St Thomas\u2019 on the south bank of the Thames. </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It was understood that Mr Johnson was driven to St Thomas\u2019 hospital, across the Thames from Westminster, at about 8pm, and given oxygen treatment.

Thus the older age group, starting from above 60 years old, they seem to show much more severe illness. It is in line with the adage that as we get older, we also pick up comorbidities along the way</p> \n   <p>However, this is not universal and as we know, fit and young people can also end up needing critical care support.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Does this mean he has pneumonia or not necessarily?</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It is hard to tell, it may be just precautionary. If a patient is developing pneumonia, it can get progressively worse very quickly and hence early admission upon the first signs of difficulty with breathing are very import and hence it is important for people recovering at home that there be a monitoring system in place too. Something that we have thus far not introduced.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>What sort of care do people receive in hospital when admitted with Covid-19?</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Simple oxygen support, to oxygen via mask and in some cases ventilatory support.

The plan is to enable oxygen exchange, enable the lungs to recover and while they are recovering we give a much higher does of oxygen to them as a tool to assist with keeping patients adequately oxygenated and prevent damage to other organs too.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>What proportion of people who have Covid-19 tend to need hospital treatment?</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We do not have the full range of data on this matter; estimates show that it would be in the range 5-10%.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-06T09:14:21.968Z\">at 10.14am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8ae93d8f080bdb9f534e81\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-06T08:44:11.736Z\">9.44am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Sturgeon: 'News management couldn't be further from my mind'</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Scotland\u2019s first minister, <strong>Nicola Sturgeon</strong>, has defended her decision not to sack Catherine Calderwood as soon as it emerged that Scotland\u2019s chief medical officer had twice visited her second home while fronting the stay at home campaign. </p> \n  <p>Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Sturgeon also denied trying to bury the story of Calderwood\u2019s resignation last night under news about Boris Johnson being treated in hospital. </p> \n  <p>She said: \u201cThe normal rules of politics, or spin, or news management, couldn\u2019t be further from my mind.

What concerns me is that some of the guidance already beginning to appear around the country is misplaced, immoral and illegal.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Politicians \u2013 with one or two glorious exceptions \u2013 have been remarkably quiet around all this</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Advice for doctors published last week by the British Medical Association says that patient age, \u201cwhere clinically relevant\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/apr/01/ventilators-may-be-taken-from-stable-coronavirus-patients-for-healthier-ones-bma-says?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\">could be a factor in predicting survival</a> in decisions about extending or withholding more intensive treatment, including access to ventilators to support breathing.</p> <p>\u201cAge cannot be the sole proxy [for worth], indeed it should not be the primary proxy,\u201d says Macaskill. \u201cThere are many active people in their 70s who would have more beneficial clinical outcomes than, say, somebody in their 50s living with multiple co-morbidities.\u201d</p> <p>The extent of any underlying chronic health conditions, as well as<strong> </strong>frailty \u201cshould have greater significance than simply age when you have that hellish decision to make\u201d, he adds.</p> <p>Macaskill is calling for an immediate initiative to draw up agreed national guidance, with a process involving not just acute-care doctors and ethicists but also geriatricians, gerontologists and social-care leaders. He believes it could be completed, virtually, within 48 hours. But he says the leadership of politicians would be crucial.</p> <p>\u201cWe should not be leaving this to the clinicians. Critically, they are the ones who are going to have to make and action the heavy choices. We need greater political intervention in the debate and politicians \u2013 with one or two glorious exceptions \u2013 have been remarkably quiet around all this.\u201d</p> <p>At Scottish Care, Macaskill \u2013 who has a background in further and higher education and faith studies \u2013 seeks to apply a human-rights test to all policies and practice. He says he is dismayed by those who wish to scrap the <a href=\"https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/human-rights/human-rights-act\">Human Rights Act</a> and dilute the UK\u2019s commitment to the <a href=\"https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/what-european-convention-human-rights\">European convention on human rights</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s a historical failure to realise where the modern system of human rights came from, which inescapably was the horrors of the second world war.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"df4309bff26fc826eb975beac9027c90da25a43d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/df4309bff26fc826eb975beac9027c90da25a43d/0_139_4256_2554/1000..jpg\" alt=\"SILHOUETTED OLD AGE PENSIONER\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Macaskill believes the traumatic events of the past few weeks have helped social care belatedly start to earn proper recognition in policy circles.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rosemary Roberts/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since the coronavirus crisis broke, Macaskill has attracted attention not only for his <a href=\"https://scottishcare.org/ceo-statement-on-coronavirus-age-shall-not-limit-them/\">forceful stance on older people\u2019s right to life</a>, but also for <a href=\"https://www.homecareinsight.co.uk/exclusive-scottish-care-ceo-calls-on-uk-supermarkets-to-support-social-care-staff/\">taking on the leading supermarket chains</a> for not giving social-care workers the same access to protected shopping time that they have made available to NHS staff.</p> <p>\u201cWe have staff coming off 12-hour shifts, struggling to get into the local Tesco because at that very time it\u2019s the shopping hour for the NHS,\u201d he says. Smaller care homes that have always shopped locally for supplies, supporting their high street, have also found themselves unable to get what they need. \u201cThey have tried to do the right thing, rather than buy from big multinational chains, and it\u2019s come back to bite them.\u201d</p> <p>Does he think the health and care sector can withstand the crisis? Scotland, he believes, is slightly better placed than the rest of the UK thanks to its relatively small size, greater past investment \u2013 with <a href=\"https://www.indeed.co.uk/salaries/care-assistant-Salaries,-Scotland\">social-care pay higher</a> and <a href=\"https://data.sssc.uk.com/images/StaffVacancies/Staff_vacancies_in_care_services_2018.pdf\">vacancy rates lower</a> than in England \u2013 and earlier planning for the emergency.</p> <p>But coronavirus is already in what he terms \u201ca good number\u201d of care homes, including <a href=\"https://www.glasgowtimes.co.uk/news/18360553.three-elderly-residents-crisis-hit-burlington-court-care-home-die---bringing-death-toll-16/\">Burlington Court</a> in Glasgow where 16 deaths in just over a week have been linked to the disease. \u201cPeople are frightened that this virus will strike the most vulnerable and strike in the heart of their care home communities,\u201d he says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/04/why-are-we-gambling-with-the-lives-of-elderly-people-and-their-carers\">Why are we gambling with the lives of elderly people and their carers? | Nick Cohen</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He thinks availability of personal protection equipment (PPE) has so far been better than in England, owing to a coordinated distribution model across social care and the NHS.

We must make sure frontline care workers have all the PPE they need.\u201d</p> <p>Macaskill warns that health and care will get through only if social care is treated on a par with the health service when it comes to such issues as PPE distribution. \u201cWhat I am very clear on is that if social care remains the handmaiden of the NHS, rather than being seen as an equal sister, then we will not achieve the positive outcomes we all want to see,\u201d he says. \u201cSocial care has to be valued in its own right because it is critical to us beating the virus in the community generally, but in care homes in particular.\u201d</p> <p>The increasingly traumatic events of the past few weeks have helped social care belatedly start to earn proper recognition in policy circles, he thinks. But he fears there remains \u201ca huge distance to travel\u201d in winning it equal status with the NHS in the public mind.</p> <p>\u201cThis crisis will certainly help that,\u201d Macaskill says. \u201cBut will it completely change things?

It was a nice conversation. We talked about pretty much this [coronavirus].</p> \n  <p>\u201cHe gave me his point of view, and I fully understood that, and we just had a very friendly conversation. It lasted probably 15 minutes and it was really good, really nice.

It doesn\u2019t mean that I agree with those suggestions.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The soft tone was all the more striking because Trump was on irascible form with reporters.

He will not.</p> \n  <p>And the d\u00e9tente did not last. Later in the briefing, Trump made spurious claims about the Obama-Biden\u2019s handling of swine flu and failure to stockpile equipment.

The deadline for election officials to receive the ballot is 13 April. The decision, which came shortly after the <a href=\"https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2020%2Fapr%2F06%2Fwisconsin-primary-election-in-person-voting-coronavirus\">state supreme court</a> ordered the election to move forward on Tuesday, ends days of legal fighting over the deadline for receiving absentee ballots in the state. </p> \n  <p>State law requires them to be received at election offices by 8pm on election night in order to count, but a federal judge extended that deadline to 13 April amid an unprecedented surge in requests for mail-in balloting.

As of Monday morning, a little over 11,000 voters who had requested a ballot in the state had yet to be issued one. In an unsigned opinion, the five conservative justices on the court said it was ruling on a \u201cnarrow, technical question\u201d, and that the lower court\u2019s decision to extend the ballot deadline without requiring a postmark went beyond what plaintiffs had asked for.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe court\u2019s decision on the narrow question before the court should not be viewed as expressing an opinion on the broader question of whether to hold the election, or whether other reforms or modifications in election procedures in light of Covid\u201319 are appropriate,\u201d the majority wrote. Writing for the court\u2019s four liberal justices in dissent, Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote that the majority did not understand the scope of the case: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>While I do not doubt the good faith of my colleagues, the court\u2019s order, I fear, will result in massive disenfranchisement.
