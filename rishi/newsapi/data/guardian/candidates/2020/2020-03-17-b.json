He also declined to bow out of the 2016 primary even after it was mathematically impossible to win the nomination, instead successfully pushing for a more progressive party platform and major rule changes. And at the same time that Sanders faces pressure from mainstream Democrats to exit, many on the left are encouraging him to stay in.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>They also make the point that, potentially, with primaries pushed back until the public has seen the full impact of the coronavirus outbreak, there might be a decided shift in mindset in favour of Sanders\u2019 policies on, say, healthcare and labor laws, by the end of the campaign.</p> \n  <p><strong>Read it here</strong> - <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/17/bernie-sanders-not-going-quietly-132641\">Politico: \u2018Who is going to advise him to drop out?\u2019: Bernie may not be ready for quick exit</a></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e70b6788f085e564ad85a15\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-17T11:43:43.759Z\">11.43am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Frank LaRose, Ohio\u2019s Secretary of State, has been on CNN talking about the state\u2019s decision to cancel today\u2019s primary vote.</p> \n  <p>He told them that the decision had been taken after the guidance they were receiving about whether it was safe to proceed with the election \u201cchanged dramatically on Monday morning\u201d.

Treasury officials \u2014 like the rest of government \u2014 were completely blindsided by yesterday\u2019s dramatic clampdown, and were last night hastily considering a range of options that might keep small businesses afloat.

The president has instructed me, this is no fault to American workers, for medical reasons we\u2019re shutting down.\u201d</p> <p>Speaking after the Republican senator, Mitt Romney, proposed sending $1,000 cheques, Mnuchin said the value of the payments would be \u201cbigger than what\u2019s in the press\u201d.</p> <p>The handouts are part of a wider $850bn stimulus package the Trump administration is negotiating with Congress. The bank bailout package agreed at the time of the financial crisis \u2013 known as Tarp \u2013 was worth $700bn.</p> <p>The US Federal Reserve will also invest $10bn to a special purpose vehicle to provide guarantees that the central bank would purchase up to $1tn of US corporate bonds if required, aiming to smooth the financial markets after weeks of turmoil.</p> <p>Mnuchin also said the White House planned to allow individual taxpayers to defer payments of up to $1m and for companies of up to $10m, in steps that could cost the government as much as $300bn.</p> <p>Speaking alongside Mnuchin at the press conference, Trump said: \u201cWe\u2019re going big. We want to get it done and have a big infusion as opposed to going through little meetings every couple of days. </p> <p>\u201cWe want to go big \u2013 we want to go solid. The country\u2019s strong. With this invisible enemy, we don\u2019t want airlines going out of business or people not having jobs and being able to live, when they were doing OK four weeks ago.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe have ways of getting out money in many ways, very quickly and very actively.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>A businessmen allied with Vladimir Putin has said he will sue the US for $50bn (\u00a341bn) in damages after prosecutors dropped charges of meddling in the 2016 elections.</p> <p>Yevgeny Prigozhin, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/17/putins-chef-a-troll-farm-and-russias-plot-to-hijack-us-democracy\">often dubbed \u201cPutin\u2019s chef,\u201d</a> claimed in a statement on Tuesday that he had been \u201cwrongfully persecuted\u201d by US prosecutors who said his company Concord had funded an internet troll factory that had promoted Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy during the US elections.</p> <p>The charges, which were filed by special counsel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-mueller\">Robert Mueller</a> following his nearly two-year investigation into Russian meddling, were abruptly dropped on Monday, a month before trial. Prosecutors said the Russian company had \u201cno exposure to meaningful punishment\u201d and that the prosecution risked exposing investigative sources and methods.</p> <p>A day later, Prigozhin went on the attack, saying the dropped charges showed that the US government \u201cfeared publicity and just court proceedings\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThis means that the allegations that \u2018Prigozhin interfered in the US presidential election,\u2019 \u2018Concord interfered in the US presidential election,\u2019 or \u2018Russia interfered in the US presidential election\u2019 are mendacious and false,\u201d said Prigozhin, according to the statement released by his company.</p> <p>Prosecutors had previously complained that documents they had provided to the defence had ended up online, and had been hesitant to deliver more sensitive information to Concord\u2019s defence team.</p> <p>It is not clear whether the plans to file a lawsuit are serious, where the lawsuit will be filed, and why Prigozhin values the damages against him at $50bn. The company\u2019s press office declined to give any more information about Prigozhin\u2019s plans on Tuesday.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/17/putins-chef-a-troll-farm-and-russias-plot-to-hijack-us-democracy\">Putin\u2019s chef, a troll farm and Russia's plot to hijack US democracy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In 2018, a US grand jury indicted 13 Russians, companies with ties to Prigozhin and the Internet Research Agency (IRA), a troll farm that created fake accounts and memes to help sway public opinion in the US. At the time Prigozhin had said of the indictment: \u201cI am not at all disappointed that I appear in this list. If they want to see the devil, let them.\u201d</p> <p>A former restaurateur who met Putin in the early 2000s, Prigozhin later won lucrative contracts to supply food to Russian schools and soldiers. He has largely kept a low profile, but came under fire last year after more than 130 Moscow schoolchildren fell ill with dysentery. Concord Catering, a company previously tied to Prigozhin, was later ordered by a court to pay compensation to parents.</p> <p>US investigators have also alleged that he handled political projects for the Kremlin, like the St Petersburg-based troll farm, which investigators said was part of an influence campaign ordered by the Kremlin.</p> <p>Russian media have also reported <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/11/yevgeny-prigozhin-who-is-the-man-leading-russias-push-into-africa\">his ties to the Wagner paramilitary group</a>, which has fought in Syria, Ukraine and has a growing footprint in Africa. US authorities last year sanctioned a private jet they said belonged to Prigozhin and had made trips to Sudan and the Central African Republic, countries where the Russian mercenaries are active. Prigozhin, who rarely gives interviews, has denied any links to the outfit.</p>",

  "<p>A fictional film about a US president mismanaging the response to a dangerous pandemic would never depict its lead character anywhere near as selfish and bumbling as Donald Trump in the age of Covid-19. He\u2019d be too cartoonish and inept to be believable.</p> <p>And yet, here we are. At a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c70n5Xc-rCs\">press conference</a> on Sunday \u2013 the same day that state governors declared closures of bars and restaurants and when the Covid-19 <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-51901976\">death count</a> shot up in Italy \u2013 the American president spent more time gushing over the Federal Reserve\u2019s interest rate cut, heaping praise on big corporate retailers for keeping Americans well-supplied, and praising Friday\u2019s rise in the stock market (\u201calmost 2,000 points!\u201d) than, say, addressing the health concerns of the public.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s response goes beyond incompetence \u2013 it\u2019s a political abomination. However uncoordinated his administration\u2019s moves have been, Trump has made it clear he sees this pandemic chiefly as a threat to the market and wealthy people\u2019s personal interests (and relatedly, his own political future) \u2013 not to the people whose lives it will threaten or claim.</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happened with the Fed is phenomenal news,\u201d Trump gushed at the press conference, \u201cwhat\u2019s happening with all of these incredible companies is phenomenal news!\u201d \u201cRelax,\u201d he later continued, \u201cwe\u2019re doing great, it all will pass.\u201d These words hardly matched the reality on the ground, as Covid-19 was shutting down whole nations across Europe, and American hospitals were <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/us/coronavirus-covid-surgeries-canceled.html\">cancelling</a> elective surgeries to prepare for a potential surge of the critically ill.</p> <p>Trump and his allies\u2019 impulse to protect the powerful led the administration to undercut the nation\u2019s public health infrastructure long before the rise of coronavirus \u2013 a fact that helps contextualize his response today. For instance, he signed an executive order in January 2017 that froze hiring of federal workers, leading to almost 700 vacancies at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC); some such positions were at a key department that \u201cregulates some of the world\u2019s most dangerous bacteria and viruses and manages the nation\u2019s stockpile of emergency medical countermeasures\u201d, the Washington Post <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2017/05/19/nearly-700-vacancies-at-cdc-because-of-trump-administration-hiring-freeze/\">reported</a>.</p> <p>That same year, Trump and congressional Republicans nearly succeeded in passing a bill that would have gutted Medicaid \u2013 and that also would have eliminated the Prevention and Public Health Fund, <a href=\"https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20170307.059053/full/\">the </a><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2017/03/08/obamacare-repeal-guts-crucial-public-health-funds/?arc404=true\">source of 12% of the CDC\u2019s budget</a>. Such cuts had one big beneficiary: corporations and the very wealthy, who would have seen big tax cuts had the repeal legislation passed. Later, in 2018, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/3/14/21177509/coronavirus-trump-covid-19-pandemic-response\">it </a><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/nsc-pandemic-office-trump-closed/2020/03/13/a70de09c-6491-11ea-acca-80c22bbee96f_story.html\">disbanded the White House\u2019s pandemic office</a> charged with responding to outbreaks like Covid-19 \u2013 putting no leadership structure in its place.</p> <p>Since the pandemic began, the administration has hardly reprioritized. As Politico\u2019s Dan Diamond <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/07/trump-coronavirus-management-style-123465\">reported</a>, Trump opposed evacuating a cruise ship that was stuck off the coast of California, even though it seemed like the right thing to do, noting that: \u201cI don\u2019t need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn\u2019t our fault.\u201d As Diamond suggested in an interview on National Public Radio\u2019s Fresh Air, \u201c[t]he lower the numbers on coronavirus, the better for the president, the better for his potential re-election this fall.\u201d</p> <p>In that same vein, the president has baselessly boosted the stock market while providing deceptive public health reassurances. \u201cThe Coronavirus,\u201d he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1232058127740174339?ref_src=twsrc%255Etfw\">tweeted</a> on 24 February, \u201cis very much under control in the USA \u2026 Stock Market starting to look very good to me!\u201d</p> <p>Trump built on this idea last Friday. At a press conference where he finally declared Covid-19 a national emergency, Trump bizarrely passed the microphone to one corporate CEO after another \u2013 \u201ccelebrities in their own right\u201d, he <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-conference-3/\">gushed</a>, \u201c\u2026 the biggest business people, the greatest retailers anywhere in the world\u201d. After the conference, he sent a note to his supporters, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/13/politics/trump-stock-market-gains-signed-photo/index.html\">obtained and reported by CNN</a>, that trumpeted: \u201cFrom opening of press conference, biggest day in stock market history!\u201d It included a graph of the Dow Jones Industrial Average with his signature \u2013 as much a statement of his political priorities as historians are likely to uncover.</p> <p>Sooner or later, however, Trump will realize that he cannot bullshit his way past biology. Viruses are immune to propaganda; Covid-19 will advance regardless of Trump\u2019s avarice. From his push to grind up Medicaid to fund tax cuts for the rich in 2017, to his bungling stock-market-obsessed response to Covid-19 in 2020, Trump and company have elevated self-interest above life.</p>",

  "<p>If the coronavirus pandemic is fuelling any political hope, it is that this crisis is a robust <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2020/03/05/the-coronavirus-is-exposing-the-limits-of-populism/\">nail in the coffin of populist politics</a>. Surely, some argue, in the face of an entirely indiscriminate, unforeseen and formidable plague, for which no one can be blamed (unlike, say, greedy bankers and unscrupulous lenders in the global financial crisis, or the terrorists of 9/11) people will turn to the truth, to science and to expert-led government.</p> <p>And, true, populist leaders seem to have lost their voice, for now: the attempts to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/28/coronavirus-outbreak-migrants-blamed-italy-matteo-salvini-marine-le-pen\">blame migrants</a>, porous borders and the forces of globalisation for the coronavirus have received short shrift. Fear and deference have, momentarily at least, rendered citizens less inclined to question mainstream governments and turn to populism\u2019s snake oil vendors. Better still: it looks as though governments led by populists or populists-lite, such as Donald Trump and Boris Johnson, are set for a rough ride, too, unless they change their ways.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/life-lockdown-parma-italy-coronavirus\">Orderly, dour, cowed: how my beloved Italy is changed by coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>No one expected many Chinese citizens to question their government\u2019s robust coronavirus response, but Italian attitudes, so far, add to the sense of populism\u2019s \u2013 probably greatly exaggerated \u2013 demise. If Italy can be counted on to listen to the orders of a government that only a few weeks ago was viewed as accidental and temporary, perhaps the tide has turned on the populist Lega party leader Matteo Salvini.</p> <p>And, if it has turned on Salvini, why should it not have turned on all populists? True, there is something quite remarkable about Italy\u2019s forbearance in the face of this shock. But a couple of caveats. First, whereas these certainly are extraordinary times, Italy has always been resilient to shocks. Terrorism, migration, corruption, the financial crisis and regular, devastating earthquakes have not brought it to its knees. Indeed, the earthquakes have a lot to do with the manner in which health, police, army and emergency services are reacting now, and why Italy does a fine line in civil contingency, and its citizens an even finer line in social solidarity.</p> <p>Powerful cities; strong regions; an excellent \u2013 if decentralised \u2013 healthcare system; hi-tech industry; a web of resilient firms and civil society organisations; its own, local food production, creativity and expertise in spades (including in the highest echelons of its civil service), all despite significant regional variations, account for its capacity to respond to crises. These qualities are in evidence today \u2013 as always. But they have not been enough in the past to ward off populism, a force that can be reignited at a stroke in tumultuous times. Think already of <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d3bc25ea-652c-11ea-b3f3-fe4680ea68b5\">the reaction</a>, including on the Italian far right, to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/ecb-announces-plan-to-help-eurozone-banks-withstand-coronavirus\">remarks made by Christine Lagarde</a>, the president of the European Central Bank, that suggested that Italy would have to cope alone.</p> <p>Another caveat: it is early days \u2013 for every nation. I, too, want to believe that there will be a significant turn against populist politics, but I have worries. The first is that much depends on whether <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2020/mar/15/europe-empties-its-streets-to-slow-coronavirus-in-pictures\">the draconian measures</a> taken in Italy, France and Spain, and elsewhere in Europe, are seen to make a big difference. Even if the various closures and lockdowns are effective at containing the spread of the virus, it will be very difficult to assert counterfactuals: \u201cit could have been so much worse\u201d never quite cuts it, because it sounds too politically convenient.</p> <p>My second worry is what if this is only wave one of a number of coronavirus epidemics? If the virus mutates, if it is seasonal, if the different timelines of different countries create different waves of contagion and crisis, then governments will have to admit that different measures might have been needed and that we are all still learning. Such incrementalism and humility will be a difficult political message to manage. And over time will governments actually find themselves confronting populations that are grief stricken and economically poorer (that is inevitable) but also frustrated and angry \u2013 ready to acquiesce to, or even demand, more authoritarianism?</p> <p>Salvini\u2019s Lega may be haemorrhaging support, but that support is flowing mainly to the party to the (far) right of them, <a href=\"https://www.termometropolitico.it/1514947_sondaggi-elettorali-tp-coronavirus-3.html\">the Brothers of Italy</a>. The point is that crises such as this don\u2019t necessarily show populist politics up for the fraud it is. They can also have reverse results. Genuine scientific disagreements can be weaponised as conspiracy theories; legitimate hesitation dressed up as incompetence; and failures used to justify increasingly authoritarian measures and positions. Could the severity of the Covid-19 crisis serve as justification for the postponement or annulment of a major national election? Unlikely still, but not unthinkable.</p> <p>The assumption we tend to make is that if this shock encourages people to turn away from populism, it will mark a <em>return</em> to governments of the late 20th century. But this is to fundamentally misunderstand the path that we have all been on for the past few decades.</p> <p>And this is the third, and most important, worry: we continue to think we can \u201cgo back\u201d but those waters have closed behind us. We need to move into something new that associates expertise, knowledge and information. A combination of digital technology and populist politics has led us to an era of what I call populocracy. And while we need urgently to reassert truth, science and reason, how we source this expertise and ensure legitimacy for it will be a fundamental challenge.</p> <p>What will eventually rid us of populism in our time of cholera is the capacity of pluralists and true democrats to win back trust in objective facts and expertise in ways that make sense to the public. This will be in part measured by the success of the measures taken against the pandemic, of course. But, in a crisis that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/07/coronavirus-a-disease-that-thrives-on-human-error\">promises to initially overwhelm our systems</a>, and record nothing but loss of life and defeat, success will also be about demonstrating that whatever was done, was done with people\u2019s needs in mind, especially those of the least well off and the most vulnerable.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/28/coronavirus-outbreak-migrants-blamed-italy-matteo-salvini-marine-le-pen\">Migrants aren\u2019t spreading the coronavirus \u2013 but nationalists are blaming them anyway | Daniel Trilling</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Governments must also demonstrate that they can use digital technology and its promise of shared information and expertise for the greater good and with the greatest flexibility.

  "<p>In June 2010, Vladimir Putin\u2019s spies broke into the <em>Guardian</em>\u2019s Moscow office. This was a regular thing. Whenever I wrote a story that displeased the Kremlin, the FSB spy agency paid a nocturnal visit. On this occasion, the goons removed the office phone from its cradle and laid it demonstratively on the table. Apparently, they didn\u2019t like my coverage of big news from America.</p> <p>That week, the FBI had exposed a ring of deep-cover Russian sleeper agents. The undercover spies had been living in Boston, New York and Washington, in leafy suburban homes. Their task was to ferret out information from US officials and thinktanks. The agents had fake American names. Some had been there for decades, sent at the end of the cold war on a lonely mission, like satellites blasted into space.</p> <p>Since 2000, the FBI had been secretly watching the group. The bureau had a mole: a disillusioned Russian foreign intelligence officer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jun/27/russian-double-agent-tried-absence\" title=\"\">Alexander Poteyev</a>. Poteyev gave the CIA details of Moscow\u2019s \u201cillegals\u201d, working under non-diplomatic cover. Some were husband and wife. Their children grew up in the US and Canada, speaking English and knowing nothing of their parents\u2019 real nationalities or furtive occupation.</p> <p>The BBC\u2019s security editor, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/correspondents/gordoncorera\" title=\"\">Gordon Corera,</a> has written a lively and engrossing account of the FBI\u2019s decade-long counterintelligence operation against the illegals, <em>Russians Among Us</em>. He talked to special agents whose job it was to watch them 24/7. The FBI placed bugs and broke into their homes. It monitored secret communications with Moscow, marital rows, even lovemaking.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Corera correctly notes that the US and UK were slow to appreciate Russia\u2019s malign intent once Putin became president</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Russia\u2019s foreign intelligence agency, the SVR, ran its agents along classic cold war lines, it turned out. From time to time, a courier codenamed Christopher Metsos flew to the US to meet individual members of his secret team. Money to fund their activities was hidden next to a semi-buried beer bottle. On another occasion, Metsos picked up cash from a Russian official, swapping bags in the New York subway.</p> <p>The FBI made interesting discoveries about how the illegals spoke to Moscow. The oldest tapped out coded radio messages. The youngest, the glamorous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/31/fbi-russian-spy-ring-anna-chapman\" title=\"\">Anna Chapman</a>, used a laptop to access a private wireless network, while meeting a handler in a Manhattan coffee bar. There was also steganography: encrypted text files magically hidden among innocent-looking photos of colourful flowers.</p> <p>This tradecraft was certainly ingenious, but what exactly did the spies achieve? None of them succeeded in learning US secrets. The FBI was able to warn off potential targets. Corera takes the view that the illegals were a genuine threat, on a par with the Cambridge spies who devastated British intelligence. The 21st-century Russians could have recruited a new generation of American double agents, he thinks.</p> <p>The counter-view is that the illegals were a throwback to a bygone era, by a regime that chucked Marxism-Leninism but kept the old KGB playbook. A prestigious SVR programme costing $50m ended in failure and embarrassment. The Kremlin was clearly furious. The 2010 break-in at the <em>Guardian</em>\u2019s office happened after I poked fun at the \u201camateurish and bungling\u201d behaviour of Moscow\u2019s ghost spies abroad, who used the identities of dead children.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aa8e1e2ceed2ac28d195399f1c45c22464362155\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa8e1e2ceed2ac28d195399f1c45c22464362155/0_0_2000_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Russian agent Anna Chapman in New York, June 2010\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Russian agent Anna Chapman in New York, June 2010.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Corera draws a link between the extraordinary events of that summer and Putin\u2019s subsequent revenge. The Obama administration decided to swap the illegals for four jailed Russians who had allegedly spied for the west. The exchange took place on the tarmac of Vienna airport. Watching from the Russian side was Alexander Zhomov, a veteran spymaster whom Corera likens to Karla, John le Carr\u00e9\u2019s fictional KGB super-chief.</p> <p>One of those traded by Moscow was an ex-officer from GRU military intelligence, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/mar/10/sergei-skripal-salisbury-poisoning-putin\" title=\"\">Sergei Skripal</a>. Skripal had spied for MI6. In 2018 the GRU sent two assassins to his home in Salisbury, where he lived under his own name. There, they poisoned him and his daughter, Yulia, in an operation redolent of the 2006 teapot murder of another Russian-born MI6 asset, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/19/alexander-litvinenko-the-man-who-solved-his-own-murder\" title=\"\">Alexander Litvinenko</a>.</p> <p>Corera correctly notes that the US and UK were slow to appreciate Russia\u2019s malign intent once Putin became president. In the 00s, MI6 stopped monitoring the SVR\u2019s London office, he reports. By 2005, at least 30 career spies were based at the Russian embassy in Kensington. Typically, the Russians would elude MI5 surveillance. \u201cIt was our C team against their A team,\u201d one British counter-espionage official tells him.</p> <p><em>Russians Among U</em><em>s</em> offers a persuasive account of how Moscow had adapted its espionage toolkit in the wake of the 2010 fiasco. Increasingly, the Kremlin uses a range of intermediaries to influence and subvert western politics. Some are oligarchs. Others are \u201cco-optees\u201d \u2013 Russians without formal spy training. There are also \u201ccyber\u201d illegals who, in 2016, remotely impersonated Americans on Facebook during the US presidential election.</p> <p>Did Moscow seek to influence the outcome of the EU referendum vote, in the same way it backed Donald Trump\u2019s long-shot campaign for the White House? Corera swerves around this question, alas. Theresa May and Boris Johnson say there was no \u201csuccessful\u201d interference, but refuse to define what that means. Corera doesn\u2019t examine recent donations by wealthy Russian emigres to Tory coffers.</p> <p>Overall, this is a compelling book that combines good storytelling with a subtle understanding of spy methods old and new. Corera notes that the government hasn\u2019t taken meaningful action against Russian money, even after the gruesome Skripal hit. Wealthy Russians can buy mansions as before and float their companies on the London stock exchange.</p> <p>With Johnson and \u201cglobal Britain\u201d, Russia\u2019s blurred espionage war is set to continue.</p> <p><em>Luke Harding is the author of Shadow State: Murder, Mayhem and Russia\u2019s Remaking of the West to be published in May by Guardian Faber. </em></p> <p><em>\u2022 Russians Among Us: Sleeper Cells, Ghost Stories and the Hunt for Putin\u2019s Agents </em>by Gordon Corera is published by William Collins (\u00a320).

Data shows that over a period longer than the first world war 4,215 bombs and missiles were launched from Reaper drones or RAF jets in Syria and Iraq. A wide discrepancy has emerged between estimates of the number of civilians killed. The US-led coalition against Isis estimates all air raids caused 1,370 civilian casualties. Airwars, an NGO, says there were actually more than 8,000 and possibly more than 13,000. The Ministry of Defence officially acknowledges <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/uk-air-war-isis-ends-five-years\">only one civilian casualty</a>.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Primaries come in a jumble \u2013 </strong>Three more US states will hold their Democratic presidential primaries as scheduled on Tuesday.

This place, xPoint, is a vast 18 sq mile tract of South Dakota prairie land where there are hundreds of second world war bunkers, each of 204 sq metres and said, in all, to be able to house somewhere between 6,000 and 10,000 people.

When I think of Vicino\u2019s project, his product, what comes to mind is the anthropologist Margaret Mead\u2019s judgment of what it means to secure oneself inside a shelter: a withdrawal from any notion that our fate might be communal, that we might live together rather than survive alone.

  "<p>Heath officials in Ohio have postponed the state\u2019s primary vote just hours before polls were set to open, an 11th-hour decision that came after a judge denied the governor\u2019s request to postpone the vote because of the coronavirus.</p> <p>The health director, Amy Acton, declared a health emergency that would prevent the polls from opening out of fear of exposing voters and volunteer poll workers, many of them elderly.</p> <p>Arizona, Florida and Illinois were proceeding with their presidential primaries.</p> <p>Earlier on Monday, Ohio\u2019s Governor Mike DeWine recommended that his state postpone in-person voting during Tuesday\u2019s primary elections. DeWine said he alone did not have the authority to postpone the election, but lawyers would file a lawsuit to try to move the in-person voting date to 2 June.</p> <p>\u201cWe cannot conduct this election tomorrow,\u201d DeWine said, adding that Ohioans should not be forced to make the \u201cchoice between their health and their constitutional rights and their duties as [an] American citizen\u201d.</p> <p>Later on Monday, in an interview with CNN, DeWine said without drastic moves tens of thousands of poll workers, many of them \u201cover the age of 65\u201d would be in places where the virus could spread.</p> <p>\u201cWe in Ohio have to take very tough actions and I know people in Ohio today are very upset, I respect that,\u201d DeWine added.</p> <p>But a Franklin county court of common pleas judge declined to order the postponement on Monday evening. According to a <a href=\"https://www.nbc4i.com/news/state-news/dewine-postpones-in-person-voting-for-primary-until-june-2/\">NBC news affiliate</a>, Judge Richard Frye said he was reluctant to override the election date set by the Ohio legislature and that coronavirus has been an issue of concern since January.</p> <p>The attempted move by Ohio\u2019s governor was the latest example of elected American officials in executive positions taking extra steps to fight the pandemic. The White House on Monday announced new guidelines in an attempt to curb the spread of the virus. In a press conference announcing the new guidelines Trump said he thought postponing elections was \u201cunnecessary\u201d.</p> <p>Four states were set to hold primary elections on Tuesday as the Democratic frontrunner, Joe Biden, faces off against rival Bernie Sanders for the presidential nomination. In-person votes were still set to take place in Arizona, Illinois, and Florida, despite all facing pressure to stop mass gatherings or activities that could spread the virus.</p> <p>Georgia already postponed next week\u2019s primary and Louisiana has postponed its scheduled 4 April primary. Kentucky announced on Monday it would postpone its primary from 19 May to 23 June. \u201cMy hope is that this delay will allow us to have a normal election,\u201d the secretary of state, Michael Adams, said in a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KYSecState/status/1239657695520739328\">video message</a>.</p> <p>Last week Ohio officials relocated 160 polling sites that originally were located in senior living facilities. In Illinois on Monday, Governor JB Pritzker ordered that events with gatherings larger than 50 people be canceled. The Illinois department of public health also offered <a href=\"https://www.elections.il.gov/Downloads/Misc/PDF/COVID-19%20Interim%20Guidance%20Election%20Polling%20Places.pdf\">guidance</a> for both poll workers and voters participating in the election on Tuesday, which includes practicing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/16/how-to-social-distance-convince-friends-family\">social distancing</a> and \u201ccleaning of visibly dirty surfaces followed by disinfection\u201d.</p> <p>Tammy Patrick, a former Arizona election official and a senior adviser at the bipartisan Democracy Fund, noted that many poll workers and election officials are elderly, the demographic that makes them particularly vulnerable to contracting the coronavirus. It\u2019s unclear what impact the election changes or the virus itself will have on election officials.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t know yet what impact this will have on not only the amount of poll workers we have,\u201d Patrick said. \u201c But the amount of election officials that do this work \u2026 they also have the ability to get sick \u2013 secretaries of state, all the state election boards, local boards.\u201d</p> <p>Florida\u2019s governor, Ron DeSantis, vowed again on Monday that the state\u2019s primary would go ahead.</p> <p>But veteran Democratic pollsters said the pandemic and varying state responses could dramatically change turnout.</p> <p>\u201cThe real answer is we have no idea [what will happen] unfortunately,\u201d said Democratic pollster Pete Brodnitz. \u201cI mean it\u2019s just not one unprecedented thing, it\u2019s an unprecedented thing combined with an unusual thing.\u201d</p> <p>The two remaining serious campaigns in the Democratic primary \u2013 former vice-president Biden\u2019s and Vermont senator Sanders\u2019\u2013 have drastically recalibrated their campaign schedules to give virtual town hall and tele-town hall events, to try to continue campaigning while preventing mass gatherings of people.</p> <p>The voting precautions come at a time when the Sanders campaign needs high turnout among young voters who generally favor him to help reverse the momentum back in his direction. Biden needs older Democratic voters to come out in droves to further fuel his lead in the primary.</p> <p>\u201cI mean we have the Sanders campaign which is pretty obviously in a downward direction,\u201d Brodnitz said. \u201cWhich means his supporters have to take that into account when they\u2019re ready to vote. And it\u2019s harder to motivate people under those conditions. And then you have the coronavirus which is going to be a particular concern to older voters.\u201d</p> <p>Cornell Belcher, another Democratic pollster, said all the unusual factors going into the elections on Tuesday meant that this \u201cis really uncharted waters\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what turnout\u2019s going to look like when you have such uncertainty and fear out there,\u201d Belcher said.</p> <p>Belcher added that it wasn\u2019t clear who had the advantage going into the primaries but he said it was arguable that \u201cBiden clearly has a broader coalition of voters. Does Biden have a stronger core base of voters than Sanders? I don\u2019t know if he does.</p> <p>\u201cSo the question will come \u2018does the broadness of Biden\u2019s support enough to overcome what I think is clearly a base energy advantage that Sanders has,\u201d Belcher said.</p>",

Biden can win over reluctant Latinos with a bold and progressive stance on immigration, she said.<br></p> <p>\u201cI hope that he doesn\u2019t eat up the lie that he has to be more conservative on the immigration issue,\u201d said Romero, who hasn\u2019t endorsed Biden or Sanders since her favoured candidate, Elizabeth Warren, dropped out. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be afraid of an issue that is so important for Latino voters, water it down and not have policies that Latinos can get excited about.\u201d</p> <p>Arizona and Florida are both likely to be battlegrounds in the November election. In Arizona, one in three residents is Latino; in Florida, it\u2019s one in four.</p> <p>Early in his administration, Obama aggressively increased efforts to deport immigrants living in the country illegally. He\u2019d hoped to convince members of Congress and the public that he was serious about border security in order to secure a comprehensive immigration reform bill that would extend legal status to millions of people living in the US without authorization. The reform bill never passed, but the deportations disrupted families, drove fear in immigrant communities and left deep wounds.<br></p> <p>Any Democrat\u2019s immigration policies would be superior to Trump\u2019s, but that won\u2019t be enough to excite Latinos, said Tomas Robles, co-director of Living United for Change in Arizona, or LUCHA, a Latino organizing group that has endorsed Sanders.</p> <p>\u201cYou cannot depend on people\u2019s hatred or fear of Trump to inspire them to turn out in droves for Vice President Biden,\u201d Robles said to the AP. \u201cBernie has worked hard to motivate Latinos as a base. But the entire establishment part has failed at doing the same.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e6f70828f088d7575594308\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-16T12:32:10.952Z\">12.32pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">US calls on Vietnam to release blogger Truong Duy Nhat</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The State department have issued <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/sentencing-of-blogger-and-radio-free-asia-contributor-truong-duy-nhat/\">a statement calling for the release of Truong Duy Nhat</a>, a weekly blogger for the Vietnamese service of Radio Free Asia. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/05/truong-duy-nhat-vietnam-blogger-radio-free-asia-thailand\">He disappeared in January 2019</a>, a day after he applied for refugee status with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in Bangkok, and reappeared in custody.</p> <p>Truong Duy Nhat was sentenced to a 10-year prison term last week.

Johnson was challenged about this at his Downing Street briefing, but left it to his chief medical officer, Chris Whitty to answer.</p> \n  <p>Whitty said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Of course, we completely agree with the secretary general that testing is absolutely critical. </p> \n   <p>And within the UK, we have three levels of testing at the moment. We have testing in intensive care systems, which is across the whole system. We have testing in hospitals for people who have got pneumonia for people got milder disease, and we have the GP network, which is testing in the community.</p> \n   <p>The one thing which we did stop doing was testing based on geography ... at this stage geography is much less important in the disease. </p> \n   <p>We do intend to continue to scale up testing. But I think it\u2019s important to realise the scale of UK testing which has been substantial.

As the virus moves to low income countries, we are deeply concerned about the impact it could have among populations with high HIV prevalence, or among malnourished children. </p> \n   <p>That\u2019s why we\u2019re calling on every country and every individual to do everything they can to stop transmission.

Do it for yourself, do it for others. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And he urged people around the world to stop hoarding. Tedros said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We also asked people to express their solidarity by refraining from hoarding essential items, including medicines. Hoarding can create shortages of medicines and other essential products which can exacerbate suffering. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Tedros also warned against treating Covid-19 patients at home. He said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We recognise that many countries have already exceeded their capacity to care for mild cases in dedicated health facilities. In that situation, countries should prioritize all their patients and those with underlying conditions. </p> \n   <p>Some countries have expanded their capacity by using stadiums and gyms to care for mild cases, with severe and critical cases cared for in hospitals. Another option is for patients with mild disease to be isolated and cared for at home.

Good luck with that.</p> \n   <p>No one knows for sure how to predict the unprecedented \u2013 or how to handle it. Initially there was a sense, certainly among the doctors to whom I have spoken,that Britain\u2019s position at the non-hysterical end of the spectrum was correct. The chief medical officer for England, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/08/five-coronavirus-experts-guide-british-public-through-crisis\">Chris Whitty</a>, took the view that the illness, though highly contagious, was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/03/uk-government-coronavirus-plans-strip-fire-and-police-to-essentials-covid-19\">most dangerous</a> for those with a vulnerable immune system.

There were reasons only for contingencies.</p> \n   <p>As the virus expanded and other governments reacted differently, this stance was challenged. But Whitty had accepted that, if circumstances altered, policy would shift from \u201ccontain to delay\u201d. This was undermined as global hysteria rose to a peak. Other countries were reacting as had China and South Korea, and progressed to \u201clockdown\u201d. England\u2019s chief scientific officer, Sir Patrick Vallance, unwisely mentioned the technical term \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-science-chief-defends-uk-measures-criticism-herd-immunity\">herd immunity</a>\u201d, implying that Britain would over time develop resistance to coronavirus.

overall death toll from the virus currently sweeping the world.</p> \n   <p>Emissions from petrol and diesel engines were still at \u201cdangerous\u201d levels that could imperil the most vulnerable during this and future pandemics, said the European Respiratory Society (EPS), which is a member of the EPHA.</p> \n   <p>\u201cPatients with chronic lung and heart conditions caused or worsened by long-term exposure to air pollution are less able to fight off lung infections and more likely to die,\u201d EPS member Sara De Matteis said.</p> \n   <p>\u201cThis is likely also the case for Covid-19,\u201d added de Matteis, who is also an associate professor in occupational and environmental medicine at Italy\u2019s Cagliari University.</p> \n   <p>While there is currently no proven link between Covid-19 mortality and air pollution, one peer-reviewed study into the 2003 SARS outbreak showed that patients in regions with moderate air pollution levels were 84 percent more likely to die than those in regions with low air pollution.</p> \n   <p>According to the European Environment Agency, air pollution leads to around 400,000 early deaths across the continent annually, despite European Union air quality directives.</p> \n   <p>One Covid-19 hotspot, northern Italy, has particularly high levels of PM10 - microscopic particles of pollution due largely to road traffic.</p> \n   <p>The number of fatalities in Italy shot up by 368 to 1,809 on Sunday - more than half of all the cases recorded outside China.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div

In Scotland, authorities will continue to test key workers, including critical frontline NHS staff, to ensure the people who are so essential to managing the disease but also keeping a critical infrastructure going are not self-isolating unnecessarily.</p> \n  <p>Scotland is taking the same approach to the rest of the UK in considering asking elderly people to reduce social contact amid the coronavirus outbreak, the first minister said.</p> \n  <p>Sturgeon would not comment in detail about the stringent approach other countries have taken, but said: \u201cI\u2019m not privy to the advice and decision making in those countries. My responsibility is to follow the scientific advice we\u2019ve been given, to interrogate and scrutinise that advice and to apply judgement to it.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The first minister said that Scotland has already taken \u201cquite significant steps\u201d to tackle the outbreak and possibly prevent a second severe spike. \u201cAsking everyone who has a fever or a cough to stay in their house for seven days is a significant step and behaviour change that we\u2019re asking people to apply.\u201d</p> \n  <p>She added: \u201cThat advice of course is about how we slow the spread and reduce the impact, but we do that in a way that perhaps avoids a later perhaps just as severe spike later on.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The Scottish government\u2019s ban on mass gathering does not currently apply to schools, travel, shopping and work. Dr Catherine Calderwood, Scotland\u2019s chief medical officer, described blanket school closures that lasted a few weeks as ineffective.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>[You need] a minimum of three months in order to really suppress the spread of the virus in these type of institutions. The thought that children won\u2019t mix together for three months is impossible. </p> \n   <p>We therefore risk having children congregate to other areas together, the virus is spread amongst them, so you actually have measures put in which are ineffective in keeping virus from those groups of children.</p> \n   <p>To compare talking about closing the schools for two weeks, it\u2019s very very clear from the science that is not a scientific way to either prevent the spread of the virus nor indeed to protect vulnerable people.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-16T12:46:30.592Z\">at 12.46pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6f6ed68f088d75755942f6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/graemewearden\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-16T12:23:11.073Z\">12.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Fears of the pandemic prompting a global recession have driven the FTSE 100 in the <strong>UK</strong> down 7.2% to 4976 points.

There was a testy exchange where Sanders criticised Biden for his refusal to disavow a super PAC supporting his candidacy and his past comments on potential cuts to social security.</li> \n   <li>Joe Biden<strong> </strong><strong>vowed to choose a woman as his running mate</strong> if he won the presidential nomination.
