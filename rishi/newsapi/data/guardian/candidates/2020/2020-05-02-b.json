  "<p>A young film-maker who worked on a music video that mocked Egyptian president Abdel Fatah al-Sisi has died in an Egyptian prison, after he was imprisoned without trial for more than two years.</p> <p>Shady Habash, 24, died inside Cairo\u2019s infamous Tora prison complex, from \u201chealth issues not yet specified,\u201d according to announcements from family and friends.</p> <p>Habash\u2019s detention and death represent a stark reminder of the growing number of young people at risk inside Egypt\u2019s sprawling prison system, including many detained for their work as artists, making dissenting statements against Sisi\u2019s rule or for no charge at all.</p> <p>There is also growing concern over unsanitary and unsafe mass detentions inside Egyptian prisons, reflecting fears about the spread of Covid-19 in places of detention around the world. Prominent activist Alaa Abdel al-Fattah, re-imprisoned last September, recently began a hunger strike in protest at prison conditions. The Egyptian authorities, who <a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde12/2152/2020/en/\">suspended</a> prison visits in March due to the coronavirus outbreak, have been criticised for widespread and deadly medical neglect of prisoners, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/17/mohamed-morsi-dead-ousted-president-egypt-collapses-after-court-session\">former president Moham</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/17/mohamed-morsi-dead-ousted-president-egypt-collapses-after-court-session\">ed Morsi</a>, who collapsed and died in court in June 2019.</p> <p>Mai al-Sedany, an expert on the Egyptian legal system with the Washington thinktank the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy, said that Habash\u2019s death highlights rising concern around a lack of due process in Egypt. This includes \u201ca rise in prosecution around freedom of expression, continued and near automatic pretrial detention extensions in violation of even Egyptian law, and poor prison conditions that severely harm the well-being of those incarcerated,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The young artist was detained in March 2018, after directing a music video for the exiled Egyptian rock musician Ramy Essam. The video sees Essam, who now lives in Sweden, dancing as he criticises the rule of Egyptian president Sisi, comparing him to a date or \u201cbalaha\u201d, the name of a character in a popular comedy film used against Sisi by his critics. \u201cYou live in gardens and we live in jails,\u201d he sings, \u201cmay the Lord take you we all pray, with all your gang boys in that darkest jail, I hope you rot in such a place.\u201d</p> <p>The video\u2019s release prompted the arrest of eight people, most with little connection to Essam. These included Habash, the poet and lyricist Galal al-Beheiry and Mohamed Abdel-Basset, who was arrested after playing the song on his car stereo in Kuwait and deported back to Egypt. All were accused of joining a terrorist group and spreading false news. Beheiry was <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-egypt-rights/egypt-military-court-sentences-poet-to-prison-for-insulting-army-idUSKBN1KL2KX\">sentenced</a> to three years in prison in July 2018 for publishing false news and insulting the military in a separate military trial.</p> <p>Following the release of five involved in the case, Habash and Mustafa Gamal, who helped Essam verify his Facebook page, remained in prison on pre-trial detention. \u201cHe should have been released after two years,\u201d said a representative from the Cairo-based Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression, who asked not to be named for their own safety. \u201cInstead he was forced to remain in custody with no legal grounds. He died in jail, where he shouldn\u2019t have been in the first place. No artist should be in jail for his work.\u201d</p> <p>Essam <a href=\"https://www.ramyessam.com/post/photographer-director-shady-habash-dies-at-the-age-of-24-in-egyptian-prison?fbclid=IwAR3DkN6i_2odqe6Lni9q_kD-CvW1MgKB7ggGpOwWCWGOvixO8M_Qtc-agIs\">wrote</a> on his website that \u201cShady didn\u2019t have anything to do with the content of the song.\u201d He also published Habash\u2019s last letter from prison, <a href=\"https://www.ramyessam.com/post/photographer-director-shady-habash-dies-at-the-age-of-24-in-egyptian-prison?fbclid=IwAR3DkN6i_2odqe6Lni9q_kD-CvW1MgKB7ggGpOwWCWGOvixO8M_Qtc-agIs\">headed</a>, \u201cPrison doesn\u2019t kill, loneliness does.

She also served under George W Bush and Bill Clinton.</p> <p>The White House announced Friday night that it had nominated a new inspector general for the department. Grimm would be the fourth government watchdog pushed out in recent weeks.</p> <p>In a statement, Patty Murray, a Democratic senator from Washington state, said: \u201cWe all know the president hasn\u2019t told people the truth about this virus or his administration\u2019s response, and late last night, he moved to silence an independent government official who did.</p> <p>\u201cThe president cannot be above oversight, no matter how he denies, attacks, and fights against it.\u201d</p> <p>On Twitter on Saturday morning, Trump insisted it was safe for the Senate to return to the Capitol.</p> <p>\u201cThere is tremendous CoronaVirus testing capacity in Washington for the Senators returning to Capital [sic] Hill on Monday,\u201d he wrote.</p> <p>The Times, however, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/us/politics/coronavirus-testing-senate-white-house.html\">reported</a> that the office of the Congress doctor, Dr Brian Monahan, did not think it could test all 100 senators.</p> <p>\u201cLikewise the House, which should return but isn\u2019t because of Crazy Nancy P[elosi],\u201d Trump added. The House speaker has said members should not return next week \u2013 in response to guidance from Monahan.</p> <p>Nearly 200 members of Congress are more vulnerable to serious complications from a Covid-19 infection because they are 65 and older. Pelosi herself is 80. It is unknown how many are also at-risk because of underlying conditions or who live with people who would be at greater risk if they contracted the illness.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/01/trump-lie-kayleigh-mcenany-press-secretary-coronavrius-michael-flynn\">Trump 'cannot tell a lie' \u2013 but can Kayleigh McEnany, his new press secretary?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe 5 minute Abbott Test will be used,\u201d Trump wrote.

The government has been paralysed by a months-long political dispute over who won last year\u2019s presidential election, which prompted the US to withhold a billion dollars of funding, vital to the functioning of a country with little tax base.</p> <p>US President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to sign a withdrawal deal with the Taliban, in a bid to end America\u2019s long war, has thrust the civil conflict between Afghan factions into an uncertain new phase. The militants have scaled back attacks in major cities but have rejected calls for a ceasefire to give time to fight the virus. They continue to attack government forces around the country, arguing their pact of non-aggression is only with the US.</p> <p>In northern Kunduz province, a hospital where a fifth of staff have been quarantined with suspected infections remains open to receive war wounded from the battles raging nearby because there is nowhere else to treat them, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/world/asia/afghanistan-coronavirus-hospitals.html\">it has been reported.</a></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Some Zabul residents who had been labourers in Iran brought the virus home with them</p> <footer> <cite>Hashim Tokhi, doctor</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Taliban has allowed health officials in the south to travel to rural areas, including those under militant control, to provide coronavirus information and checks, doctors and officials say.

There have been 24 cases confirmed already, but hospitals were unprepared, he claimed, after funds were siphoned off by corruption.</p> <p>\u201cIn terms of equipment, we have zero of that, nothing.

It has an incredible capacity for self-reinvention\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Now that the coronavirus is here, Lewis has further predictions. He says that financial speculators will be looking to the White House for tips to exploit the economic crisis that the pandemic has unleashed.</p> <p>\u201cGiven what we know about Trump and his network of cronies,\u201d he says, \u201cyou just wonder how many of them are out there with some advanced notice of what he\u2019s going to say, and are taking advantage of it.\u201d</p> <p>While he may not be overly concerned with the complexities of good governance, Trump has maintained a firm focus on a much more visible, if volatile, yardstick of success: the US stock market.</p> <p>On 12 February, the main <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/feb/12/european-us-stock-markets-record-highs-coronavirus-fears-stock-markets-business-live\">US stock indexes recorded all-time highs</a>, and the president was a happy man. Less than two weeks later, as Wall Street realised the dimensions of the approaching pandemic, there was a spectacular crash, followed by a series of further reversals. Suddenly, Trump\u2019s chief selling point looked as vulnerable as his hairdo.</p> <p>But every stock market crash is an opportunity for the canny speculator. Lewis\u2019s bestselling book, <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/mar/27/big-short-inside-doomsday-machine\">The Big Short</a></em>, later turned into an Oscar-winning film, was a classic on the subject. It told the story of the hedge fund managers and traders who bet against the market leading up to the 2007-8 financial crisis. Now, says Lewis, such people will surely be studying Trump\u2019s Twitter account.</p> <p>\u201cThere are bound to be smart hedge funds or high-frequency traders who have figured out how to time the tweets and the market reactions. Trump has the ability to move sectors up and down by recommending a drug or saying that he\u2019s solved the problem between the Saudis and the Russians, and the oil market\u2019s going to recover.</p> <p>\u201cI keep waiting for the story that they found the guy or guys who are doing this,\u201d he says.</p> <p>For all Trump\u2019s many missteps, the political impact of Covid-19 remains far from certain. The US leads the world with over a million cases and more than <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/29/coronavirus-us-economy-covid-19-donald-trump-live\">60,000 deaths</a>. But has it awoken the American public to their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/sep/27/this-guy-doesnt-know-anything-the-inside-story-of-trumps-shambolic-transition-team\">president\u2019s methodical shortcomings</a>? Or has it simply reinforced the ideological sectarianism that is a feature of a deeply divided country?</p> <p>\u201cIt has been party politicised,\u201d says Lewis, \u201cbut less successfully than anything else that\u2019s come down the pike. You see friction between Trump and Republican governors. You see friction between Trump and Republican legislators. He should\u2019ve had a big spike up in his poll numbers. Instead, he\u2019s drifting down.\u201d</p> <p>Liberal critics have come to realise that challenging Trump often serves only to rally his supporters. But, in recent weeks, tactical circumspection has been completely abandoned. In a piece in the latest issue of <em>The Atlantic</em>, entitled <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/06/underlying-conditions/610261/\">We Are Living in a Failed State</a>, the respected commentator George Packer writes: \u201cThe crisis demanded a response that was swift, rational and collective. The United States reacted instead like Pakistan or Belarus \u2014 like a country with shoddy infrastructure and a dysfunctional government whose leaders were too corrupt or stupid to head off mass suffering.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a5a523bc32668034b24e3ceaabbce128307af6c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a5a523bc32668034b24e3ceaabbce128307af6c6/0_0_3500_2339/1000.jpg\" alt=\"President Trump talks with Reuters in interview at the White House in Washington\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I think Trump\u2019s figuring out in his reptilian brain that he actually has to solve a problem.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlos Barr\u00eda/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The nature of that shoddiness and dysfunction was the issue that Lewis explored in <em>The Fifth Risk</em>, his coruscating expos\u00e9 of the depletion of US government agencies by the Trump administration. The book, published in 2018, sought to educate Americans in the many vital roles the much-pilloried federal bureaucracy performs \u2013 from maintaining nuclear waste to assembling the data for weather forecasts.</p> <p>Nowhere was ignorance of these responsibilities quite as glaring as within the Trump camp when it walked into the White House. The presidential team had next to no interest in studying the outgoing Obama administration\u2019s painstaking transition documents.</p> <p>And ever since, Trump has displayed a barely concealed indifference to the government he is supposed to lead, either leaving key posts vacant or appointing ill-suited hangers-on or business people with obvious conflicts of interest to head up different departments, agencies and regulatory bodies.</p> <p>It\u2019s a laissez-faire attitude that has left him ill-prepared to mobilise a coordinated national response to Covid-19. Lewis rates Trump\u2019s performance at the outset of the pandemic as \u201cappallingly bad\u201d, not least because he had already dismantled a programme called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/03/trump-scrapped-pandemic-early-warning-program-system-before-coronavirus\">Predict </a>that was designed to anticipate the movement of viruses around the world.</p> <p>\u201cBut the big thing he did,\u201d Lewis adds, \u201cwas to remove the pandemic response team from the White House. So he cost us time in the beginning, and time is lives. He cost us much more time than an ordinarily inept man would\u2019ve cost us because, in addition to being inept, he dug his heels in and pretended for weeks that he wasn\u2019t inept. And those weeks were expensive.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s downplaying or outright denial of the Covid-19 threat is well-documented. From mid-January to mid-March, he seemed to view it as something that could be talked away, as though it would disappear through the sheer force of his bluster. Since then he has been forced by events to change tack. The strategic line, though, has been rather muddled: one moment he emphasises the need to support the lockdown, the next he encourages protesters to reject individual state restrictions.</p> <p>\u201cHe should be speaking for the whole country and he\u2019s not,\u201d says Lewis, \u201cbut having said that, he hasn\u2019t been as hostile to science as he might have been.\u201d</p> <p>By this, Lewis means that Trump has largely stood by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/20/fauci-coronavirus-covid-19-stay-home\">Anthony Fauci</a>, the key member of the White House coronavirus task force, whom Lewis calls \u201cthe most popular man in America\u201d. The celebrated immunologist has certainly spearheaded a much-needed revival of expertise, but nonetheless Trump\u2019s newfound support for science is not an obvious improvement on his previous hostility. After all, the cause of empirical research was hardly advanced by his suggestion that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/24/first-thing-the-drugs-dont-work-nor-does-injecting-disinfectant-covid-19\">injecting disinfectant</a> could be the answer to the pathogen.</p> <p>Lewis concedes the point, yet sees signs that Trump, or those around him, are trying to scramble together a functioning operation to deal with the pandemic, if only because there is now no alternative.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s interesting to watch,\u201d Lewis says, \u201cbecause I think he\u2019s figuring out in his reptilian brain that he actually has to solve a problem, rather than just let it all happen and then make up a story after the fact.\u201d</p> <p>The problem for Trump, whose speciality is presidential edict by tweet, is that he\u2019s never had much respect for policy and planning. The degradation of federal planning and infrastructure is not a new development. It extends back to Ronald Reagan\u2019s day, but Trump has rapidly accelerated the process. He is, says Lewis, \u201cthe last station on the Reagan Express\u201d.</p> <p>An illustrative example of his approach to government was his appointment of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/13/rick-perry-department-of-energy-trump-administration\">Rick Perry as the head of Department of Energy</a> \u2013 a huge bureaucracy that, among other things, is responsible for nuclear weapons and waste. Perry\u2019s main claim to relevance was that, as an unimpressive presidential candidate, he promised to close down the Department of Energy, without actually knowing what it did.</p> <p>Trump also unsuccessfully sought to install Barry Myers, CEO of AccuWeather, as head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which oversees the National Weather Service (NWS). At AccuWeather, which his family owns, Myers had lobbied to undermine the NWS.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s quite as cynical as Trump auctioning off the government to business interests,\u201d cautions Lewis. \u201cIt\u2018s more that he had no interest whatsoever himself, paid no attention to it, and so he had no positive motivation to put the right people into the various positions. Who then comes rushing in? The people who have a financial interest.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The  US reacted [to the pandemic] like a country whose leaders were too corrupt or stupid to head off mass suffering.</p> <footer> <cite>Michael Lewis</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Such behaviour has led Lewis to conclude that Trump never expected to become president. The campaign was just a brand-building exercise. \u201cHe\u2019s the dog who caught the car,\u201d he says. But if that were the case, wouldn\u2019t he welcome the release of electoral defeat in November?</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m guessing he\u2019s worried about going to jail if he doesn\u2019t control the White House,\u201d Lewis says.</p> <p>What\u2019s clear is that Trump has confounded, not to say dumbfounded, many experienced observers. At the outset, the received wisdom was that the established processes of the American political system, and the sheer weight of responsibility, would force the maverick to conform to presidential expectations.</p> <p>Not only has that not proven the case, but Trump has redefined the whole concept of presidential politics. The fact that no one knows what he\u2019s going to do next, least of all his advisers, has become the means by which the White House operates.</p> <p>\u201cThe model I have in my head right now for our society is the model of a family with kind of a psycho, alcoholic dad,\u201d says Lewis. \u201cIt is the story of how the country compensated for its president, which is a really bizarre story to tell about an American crisis. If you go back in history, it\u2019s usually a president who in some ways leads the response. In this case, he is being dragged along.\u201d</p> <p>But being forced in the direction he never wanted to go is not a role that a man of Trump\u2019s outsized ego will readily accept. He knows that if he is to avoid being the Neville Chamberlain of the pandemic, he has to wrest control of the narrative.</p> <p>To that end, he has directed fire at China (which does, indeed, have questions to answer) and dog-whistled the growing libertarian revolt. Ultimately, however, he will be judged on the numbers. Not of his favoured Dow Jones index \u2013 though that doesn\u2019t look great at the moment \u2013 but of the death count of Americans.</p> <p>As Lewis puts it: \u201cIf this pandemic does not wake Americans up to the importance of good government, then nothing will.\u201d</p> <p><em>Michael Lewis is the author of The Fifth Risk, published by Penguin.

Joe Biden \u2013 and allies \u2013 face key questions over sexual assault claim</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Here is what you need to know about Reade\u2019s allegation and Biden\u2019s response:</p> \n<h2>Who is Tara Reade?</h2> \n<p>A former aide to Biden from his years in the Senate, Reade, now 56, says that in 1993, in a corridor in a Senate office building, he pushed her against a wall and assaulted her, penetrating her with his fingers.</p> \n<p>According to the New York Times, a friend of Reade said she described an incident at the time, involving Biden. Two more people, another friend and Reade\u2019s brother, have said she mentioned \u201ca traumatic sexual incident involving Biden\u201d.</p> \n<p>Reade has said she went to top Biden aides in the Senate office to report being harassed by the senator but did not mention the alleged assault. Reade says the aides did not take action and she filed a formal complaint with the Senate personnel office.</p> \n<p>In 2019, Reade and seven other women publicly accused Biden of gestures that made them uncomfortable, included unwanted touching or kissing. Reade first made the allegation of assault <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/tara-reade-joe-bidens-accuser-finally-tells-her-full/id1020563127?i=1000469429963\">in a podcast episode in March</a>.</p> \n<h2>What has Biden said?</h2> \n<p>Biden and spokespeople for the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee have flatly denied the claim. On Friday, in a <a href=\"https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/statement-by-vice-president-joe-biden-7a9593bd3012\">Medium post</a>, Biden said the allegations \u201caren\u2019t true. This never happened.\u201d</p> \n<p>Biden said that although Reade says she went to top staffers in his Senate office, none of them have confirmed that she did so.</p> \n<p>Reade said she does not have a copy of the complaint she filed in 1993. In his Medium post, Biden said the only place where there could be a record of the complaint would be with the National Archives\u2019 Office of Fair Employment Practices. He wants the secretary of the Senate to ask the archives to find any record of the complaint Reade says she filed.</p> \n<p>On Saturday, the National Archives <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/may/01/us-politics-coronavirus-live-joe-biden-donald-trump-latest-updates?page=with:block-5eac72f08f087d47c7787c4d#block-5eac72f08f087d47c7787c4d\">told reporters</a> it did not hold such records, which would be held by the Senate.</p> \n<p>Biden has also faced questions about his Senate papers which are held, without being open to the public, at the University of Delaware. He has said any such complaint would not be kept there.</p> \n<h2>What are Republicans and the Trump campaign saying?</h2> \n<p>Donald Trump has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/joe-biden-denies-he-sexually-assaulted-a-former-senate-aide/2020/05/01/08d59662-8b39-11ea-9dfd-990f9dcc71fc_story.html\">said</a> he thinks Biden should respond to the allegations. On Saturday he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/may/01/us-politics-coronavirus-live-joe-biden-donald-trump-latest-updates?page=with:block-5eac76868f082b32fdd6bbf0#block-5eac76868f082b32fdd6bbf0\">compared</a> his own situation \u2013 he has been accused of sexual misconduct or assault by numerous women, claims he denies \u2013 with Biden\u2019s.</p> \n<p>Spokespeople for the National Republican Congressional Committee have publicly questioned whether Democrats who back Biden believe Reade or will call for Biden to take further steps.</p> \n<p>On Saturday, the Trump campaign accused senior Democrats of a \u201cdouble standard\u201d, comparing their defence of Biden with their approach to a sexual assault claim against Trump supreme court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in late 2018.</p> \n<h2>What have prominent Democrats said?</h2> \n<p>Democratic-aligned women\u2019s groups have moved slowly. But before Biden\u2019s statement and interview on Friday, they <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/democrats-urge-joe-biden-to-address-sexual-assault-allegation-11588276919\">began urging</a> him to address the allegation head-on.</p> \n<p>The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, the highest ranking Democrat in Congress, <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/04/30/biden-tara-reade-accusation-nancy-pelosi-defends-ex-vice-president/3056450001/\">said</a> she was satisfied with Biden\u2019s response. She also said the allegations would be taken seriously.</p> \n<p>Former Georgia house minority leader Stacey Abrams, a potential running mate for Biden, said in an <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/29/politics/stacey-abrams-joe-biden-tara-reade-cnntv/index.html\">interview</a> with CNN \u201cthat women deserve to be heard and I believe they need to be listened to, but I also believe that those allegations have to be investigated by credible sources\u201d.</p> \n<p>She also said: \u201cThe New York Times did a deep investigation and they found that the accusation was not credible. I believe Joe Biden.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Times has not said the accusation was not credible. It said <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/29/us/politics/tara-reade-joe-biden.html\">it made no conclusion either way</a>.</p>",

After weeks of silence, the presumptive Democratic nominee categorically denied the accusation in a <a href=\"https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/statement-by-vice-president-joe-biden-7a9593bd3012\">Medium post</a> and in an interview on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe.</p> <p>\u201cThis never happened, and when she first made the claim, we made it clear that it never happened, and it\u2019s as simple as that,\u201d the former vice-president said on Morning Joe.</p> <p>But, of course, it isn\u2019t as simple as that. While it\u2019s commendable that Biden finally addressed Reade\u2019s allegations directly, instead of having his campaign issue more denials, he needs to go further. Biden must authorize a search of his Senate papers, which are held at the University of Delaware, to identify any evidence of the complaint that Reade says she made about him at the time.</p> <p>Morning Joe co-host Mika Brzezinski repeatedly asked Biden if he would authorize such a search; his answer was \u201cno.\u201d Biden said that he would ask the National Archives to make public any record of a complaint filed by Reade, but would not allow his Senate papers to be unsealed as they \u201cdo not contain personnel files\u201d and could become political \u201cfodder\u201d.</p> <p>That\u2019s not good enough. Surely Biden can order an independent investigation of his Senate papers for mentions of Reade without compromising other sensitive information? If he\u2019s not capable of doing that then I\u2019m not sure he\u2019s capable of being the president of the United States.</p> <p>But what about the current president? What about the pussy-grabber in chief? What about the dozens of sexual harassment allegations against him? Why should Biden be held to a higher standard than Donald Trump?</p> <p>There has been a huge amount of whataboutism by liberals when it comes to the allegations against Biden. I can understand the frustration fueling this: the fact that Trump supporters are suddenly concerned about sexual consent is jaw-droppingly hypocritical.</p> <p>The White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, for example, seems to have suddenly become a massive #MeToo advocate. \u201c\u2018Believe all women\u2019 means <em>all</em> women,\u201d Conway <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/media/kellyanne-conway-joe-biden-accuser-believe-women\">told Fox News on Friday</a>. \u201cLet\u2019s not pretend Joe Biden doesn\u2019t have a history of, without permission, and without restraint, planting his face in the back of women\u2019s heads, sniffing their hair, fondling their necks and creeping them out,\u201d Conway <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CillizzaCNN/status/1256245211392606208?s=20\">further noted</a>. Hang on, does this woman know who she works for? Does she have any shame at all?</p> <p>But it\u2019s not just Trump supporters who are being hypocritical. Conservatives have rightly <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/495502-pelosi-tells-reporter-she-doesnt-need-a-lecture-on-biden-kavanaugh-comparison\">pointed out</a> the difference in the way Democrats and the mainstream media treated the sexual assault allegations against supreme court justice Brett Kavanaugh versus the allegations against Biden. There is arguably a lot more evidence supporting the allegations against Biden than there ever was against Kavanaugh, but there\u2019s a hell of a lot less liberal outrage. When confronted with a question about those double standards on Thursday, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/house/495502-pelosi-tells-reporter-she-doesnt-need-a-lecture-on-biden-kavanaugh-comparison\">Nancy Pelosi responded</a> by saying that she didn\u2019t need a \u201clecture or a speech\u201d and \u201cJoe Biden is Joe Biden\u201d. An extremely persuasive retort.</p> <p>I\u2019m not sure that the allegations against Biden will end up doing any serious damage to his campaign. However, the way in which the Democratic party and liberals have rallied behind him is going to do a huge amount of damage to #MeToo. Alyssa Milano, the woman who helped mainstream #MeToo, choosing to believe Biden over Reade will be brought up every single time someone says \u201cbelieve women\u201d. The way in which liberals downplayed allegations against Biden will be used as ammunition every single time someone on the right is accused of sexual assault.</p> <p>Indeed, Trump is already using the Democrats\u2019 defense of Biden to discredit his own accusers. When asked about the Reade allegations by reporters on Thursday he mused that Biden that might have been <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/495563-trump-biden-allegations-could-be-false-but-he-should-respond\">falsely accused</a>. \u201cIt could be false accusations. I know all about false accusations,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been falsely charged numerous times, and there is such a thing.\u201d Trump then went on to speak about Kavanaugh, saying: \u201cHe was falsely charged. What happened with him was an absolute disgrace to our country.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s an absolute disgrace to America: the fact that, in November, women will be forced to choose between two men credibly accused of sexual assault for president.</p> <h2><strong>New Zealand safety net helps sex workers in lockdown</strong></h2> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2003/0028/latest/DLM197815.html\">New Zealand Prostitution Reform Act</a>, developed with the input of sex workers, decriminalized sex work in 2003.

  "<p>Nearly three decades after Joe Biden faced sharp backlash over his treatment of Anita Hill, when she came before his Senate committee to accuse Clarence Thomas of sexual harassment, he urged lawmakers not to repeat the same mistakes when considering a sexual assault claim against another supreme court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, by Dr Christine Blasey Ford.</p> <p>\u201cIt takes enormous courage for a woman to come forward, under the bright lights of millions of people watching, and relive something that happened to her,\u201d Biden <a href=\"https://time.com/5403068/joe-biden-on-christine-blasey-ford/\">said</a> in 2018, as he was laying the groundwork for a presidential run.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/01/joe-biden-denies-sexual-assault-allegation-tara-reade-statement\">Joe Biden denies sexual assault allegation from former staffer Tara Reade</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ford, he said, \u201cshould be given the benefit of the doubt\u201d.</p> <p>That statement was read back to Biden during an interview on Friday, in which the presumptive Democratic nominee broke his months-long silence to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/01/joe-biden-denies-sexual-assault-allegation-tara-reade-statement\">unequivocally deny an allegation of sexual assault</a> by a former Senate aide, Tara Reade.

Period.\u201d</p> <p>For weeks Biden\u2019s campaign has grappled with how he should defend him while upholding the \u201cbelieve women\u201d ethos of the #MeToo movement that Democrats have embraced. In the years since Donald Trump was elected, Democrats have confronted sexual misconduct aggressively, policing their own ranks to draw a sharp distinction with Republicans on issues of gender, equality and accountability.</p> <p>Trump has been accused by more than a dozen women of sexual harassment, assault or rape. During the 2016 election, a recording emerged of him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-leaked-recording-women\">bragging about groping women</a>. Trump has flatly denied the allegations, often attacking his accusers as opportunists and liars.</p> <p>Indeed, on Friday the president advised Biden to \u201cgo out and fight it\u201d.</p> <p>Speaking to the conservative conservative radio host Dan Bongino, Trump suggested the accusation could be false and even sounded a note of empathy for Biden\u2019s predicament.</p> <p>\u201cAll of a sudden you become a wealthy guy, you\u2019re a famous guy, then you become president, and people \u2026 that you\u2019ve never seen, that you\u2019ve never heard of make charges,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSo I guess in a way you could say I\u2019m \u2026 sticking up for him.\u201d</p> <p>Republicans have largely remained silent about Trump\u2019s record on women. By contrast, Democrats demanded Biden publicly address the matter and some have even called for him to step down as the presumptive nominee.</p> <p>\u201cDemanding more of Joe Biden\u2019s leadership is not in contradiction with our commitment to defeat Trump,\u201d said Ana Maria Archila, co-executive director of the Center for Popular Democracy. \u201cIt is, in fact, central to that effort.\u201d</p> <p>Yet Republicans have seized on the matter in an effort to renew the poisonous political fight that erupted over Kavanaugh.</p> <p>\u201cDemocrat double standard\u201d blared a memo from the Republican National Committee which portrayed Democrats as hypocrites who held the allegation against their nominee to a higher standard of proof than the one they used against Kavanaugh.</p> <p>\u201cThe double standard exhibited by Biden, prominent liberal women\u2019s groups and Democrat elected officials \u2013 some of whom want to be Biden\u2019s running mate \u2013 is glaring and cannot be allowed to stand,\u201d said Erin Perrine, a spokeswoman for Trump\u2019s election campaign.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ab146d60850568785346d7860d7639411c760e82\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab146d60850568785346d7860d7639411c760e82/0_202_5516_3309/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amy Klobuchar speaks to Ari Melber of MSNBC.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amy Klobuchar speaks to Ari Melber of MSNBC.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Cahn/ZUMA Wire/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But Karen Finney, who worked for Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign, said Republicans were \u201cplaying with fire\u201d by attempting to create a \u201cfalse equivalency\u201d between Biden and Trump on the issue.</p> <p>Lis Smith, a senior adviser to Pete Buttigieg\u2019s Democratic presidential campaign, said: \u201cIf Republicans and Biden opponents push too hard on this, it will backfire on them and just raise the question of why President Trump has never addressed the scores of sexual misconduct allegations against him.\u201d</p> <p>Women are a core Democratic constituency. Since Trump\u2019s election, they have organized, voted and run for office in record numbers. In the presidential primary, excitement at the prospect of nominating a woman was eclipsed by fear of losing to Trump. Democrats chose Biden because they believed he was the most electable candidate. He has promised to choose a woman as his running mate.</p> <p>Lara Brown, director of the Graduate School of Political Management at George Washington University, said: \u201cIn this situation, the calculation that I think most Democrats will make is whatever Biden\u2019s problems are, Trump is worse on every level.\u201d</p> <p>Brown said accusations of hypocrisy can \u201chit more than the scandal itself\u201d, particularly when a candidate is attempting to define an opponent. But in this case, she said, the effort to brand Democrats as hypocrites would be undercut by Trump\u2019s record and Republican silence.</p> <p>Larry Jacobs, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota, said Republicans were attempting to \u201cneutralize\u201d Biden\u2019s appeal to suburban women who revolted from the party in 2018.</p> <p>But he said the controversy would probably be eclipsed by the economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak and was unlikely to be a \u201cfront-of-mind issue for voters\u201d come November.</p> <p>Biden\u2019s public silence over the last month has put top female allies in the position of defending him while validating the experiences of women who come forward. Even so, party leadership and many of the women Biden is considering for vice-president, including Senators Amy Klobuchar and Kamala Harris and former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, have voiced their support in recent days.</p> <p>\u201cI have a great comfort level with the situation as I see it,\u201d the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, told reporters on Thursday, \u201cwith all due respect in the world for any woman who comes forward, with all the highest regard for Joe Biden.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa9e402403f38207eaa39ca2c5c07b9962d7652e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa9e402403f38207eaa39ca2c5c07b9962d7652e/0_249_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stacey Abrams speaks to Jake Tapper of CNN.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stacey Abrams speaks to Jake Tapper of CNN.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Cahn/ZUMA Wire/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Pelosi said she had \u201ccomplete respect\u201d for the #MeToo movement but added: \u201cThere is also due process, and the fact that Joe Biden is Joe Biden.\u201d</p> <p>Juanita Broaddrick, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/broaddrick022599.htm\">who accused Bill Clinton of raping her in 1978</a>, accused Pelosi of being \u201chypocritical\u201d and \u201cdishonest\u201d.</p> <p>\u201c\u2018The fact is that Joe Biden is Joe Biden\u2019,\u201d she <a href=\"https://twitter.com/atensnut/status/1255957510256840706\">wrote on Twitter</a>. \u201cWhat the hell?

Gilgun leads as Vinnie, a northern town ne\u2019er-do-well who charms his way through a succession of self-made problems while supported by a diversely ragtag gang. This is peak Gilgun, who always plays remixes of more-or-less the same character in everything he does, but manages it so well it doesn\u2019t matter: brash and tender and funny, with a faultline of emotional weakness running through him, at any one time either threatening to cry about how much his friends mean to him or, alternately, giving the finger to someone out of the window of a stolen lorry while crashing it through a locked gate. This could be him in This Is England, or Misfits, or Preacher, really, but right now it\u2019s him in Brassic, a near-perfect platform for Joe Gilgun to Gilgun on.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zINFJn3-qSM\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zINFJn3-qSM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>That\u2019s not to take away from the rest of the cast, though: the smart foil of Damien Molony\u2019s Dylan, the mothering-as-a-form-of-friendship role of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/24/tv-tonight-our-girl-returns-to-danger\">Michelle Keegan</a>\u2019s Erin, Ryan Sampson as a gruff sex-empire proprietor and Dominic West as Vinnie\u2019s posh doctor. At first blush, the supporting cast seems unnecessarily huge, but the more you watch it the more things click together; the more every role in every caper makes sense.</p> <p>Structurally there are deep parallels between Brassic and the good old days of Shameless: a shambolic central lead who works his way through each episode with all the poise of a box of dropped cymbals; the Ocean\u2019s Eleven-by-way-of-Emmerdale way every plan is carefully plotted, disastrously undertaken and ultimately pulled off; a depiction of working-class life that presents poverty as a hurdle to be cheerfully leapt over once a week instead of the fundamental pulse that beats ominously behind every second of every day; one-shot characters who are far more interesting than most shows\u2019 actual leads (John Thomson plays a salty circus magician for two small scenes that, in any other circumstance, would demand their own spin-off commission).</p> <p>What I like most about Brassic is that it is an hour long. It doesn\u2019t need to be, and in the wrong hands that would be a problem: a 22-minute episode padded out with flimsy subplots, a pointless cameo, a forced one-episode romance. Instead, Brassic stretches each instalment out elegantly, giving it room to breathe: scenes run longer to accommodate extra funny lines; there are few of those structural, \u201cso what are we doing and where are we going?\u201d pieces that necessarily bolt shorter shows together. Joe Gilgun running around a village getting threatened by villains doesn\u2019t deserve to be as good as this, but it is. Here\u2019s to four or five more seasons.</p>",

But <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/michaelbloomberg\">Bloomberg\u2019s</a> enormous wealth and influence is still strong in the party via a growing network of groups, former associates and allies sprinkled across the Democratic party universe.</p> <p>Even before Bloomberg <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/04/mike-bloomberg-quits-2020-primary-race-democrats\">dropped out</a> of the presidential race in May the media mogul billionaire vowed he would work to defeat Donald Trump even if he didn\u2019t get the nomination.</p> <p>That\u2019s precisely what he is doing. </p> <p>\u201cHe was one of the biggest contributors to Democratic causes before he ran and he still is after,\u201d Abe Rakov, a veteran Democratic campaign manager, said of Bloomberg. \u201cThere are a lot of organizations and programs across the country that would be in really bad shape if he decided to disengage after he ran.\u201d</p> <p>The initial plan was to continue to fuel the massive field operation Bloomberg\u2019s campaign built. The former mayor changed his mind and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/21/mike-bloomberg-transfers-18m-to-democratic-national-committee\">instead</a> transferred $18m to the Democratic National Committee, the main organization charged with boosting the party\u2019s presidential nominee.</p> <p>It\u2019s possible Bloomberg could move more money as well. The Bloomberg campaign also transferred leases for over a dozen of its field offices to the DNC, adding to the DNC\u2019s campaign spaces around the country.</p> <p>Bloomberg himself is staying visible, working with the New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, to <a href=\"https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/amid-ongoing-covid-19-pandemic-governor-cuomo-and-mayor-mike-bloomberg-launch-nation-leading\">launch</a> a testing and tracing program. He spoke via video conference call during Cuomo\u2019s press briefing on Thursday. The governor, currently one of the most prominent Democrats in the country, said in late April that Bloomberg was working with him.</p> <p>A network of operatives and Bloomberg-connected political organizations is also active in Democratic presidential circles. Bill Knapp, a longtime Bloomberg adviser, recently joined Priorities USA, the Super Pac the Joe Biden campaign has signaled is its outside organization of choice for the general election.</p> <p>During Bloomberg\u2019s campaign, he poured almost $67m into a new digital and technology firm called Hawkfish. Hawkfish has stayed active since Bloomberg dropped out. The firm is reportedly in talks to work for Biden\u2019s presidential campaign although nothing is finalized.</p> <p>Hawkfish also got into negotiations to buy another Democratic analytics firm, Blue Labs Analytics, according to four Democrats with knowledge of those talks, but negotiations fell through. Hawkfish and Blue Labs still have ties.</p> <p>In Washington Democratic analytics circles Hawkfish has become a hot topic as a firm trying to elbow its way into the group of top-tier data analytics firms.</p> <p>The business discussions between Hawkfish and various campaigns and outlets within the Democratic campaign universe underscores how Bloomberg-connected operatives and groups continue to set down deep roots within the party.</p> <p>Some former digital and data staffers for the Bloomberg campaign have talked with Biden campaign officials about joining the campaign, according to a Democratic strategist with knowledge of those talks.</p> <p>The Biden campaign did not return a request for comment.</p> <p>\u201cI think Mayor Bloomberg has made it very plain, through his actions and his investments, his commitment to defeating Donald Trump and helping to elect Democrats across the country,\u201d said the former Michigan congressman Mark Schauer, who supported Bloomberg during the mayor\u2019s short-lived presidential campaign. \u201cI think those contributions are valuable, they\u2019re significant, and they\u2019ll have an impact this November.\u201d</p> <p>The end goal for Bloomberg, 78, is still somewhat murky.</p> <p>The former mayor has repeatedly said he would use his considerable resources to oust Trump from office. But the rapid expansion of Bloomberg-connected groups and operatives around Washington also suggests Bloomberg intends to hold a seat at the table among the most influential Democratic party leaders, albeit one outside of elected office.</p>",
  "<p>The outset of the coronavirus pandemic in Northern Ireland was beset with political disputes. First Minister Arlene Foster, of the DUP, and Deputy First Minister Michelle O\u2019Neill, of Sinn F\u00e9in, held opposing views about the closure of schools, universities and childcare facilities. In the Republic, schools were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/ireland-school-closures-reveal-stark-contrast-to-uk-covid-19-response\">closed by 13 March</a>, but the UK planned to close schools a week later, on 20 March. As often happens, the situation in the North evoked the Irish saying <em>idir dh\u00e1 st\u00f3l</em>, a shorthand for falling between two stools, neither here nor there.</p> <p>While the Irish government offered grave clarity, the North remained caught up in the UK government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/19/six-points-of-criticism-uk-governments-flailing-coronavirus-response\">widely criticised</a> tactics. These divergent responses to coronavirus established an accidental case study of two separate but overlapping approaches to the pandemic taking place on the same island \u2013 something researchers will no doubt pore over in the future.</p> <p>The Irish caretaker taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, had spoken to Boris Johnson about the island of Ireland being one epidemiological unit, but the political divisions north of the border did not allow for that. Instead, different approaches were taken at the crucial first stage of the pandemic. While the British government leapfrogged over the containment phase, largely abandoning the WHO\u2019s mantra of \u201ctest, test, test\u201d, the Irish government scrambled to keep a lid on things, gradually introducing early lockdown measures, which benefitted from huge public cooperation. One of the most frequent refrains here in the patter of Covid smalltalk among friends and neighbours is \u201cat least we\u2019re not in England or America\u201d. But of course, part of the island <em>is</em> in the UK.</p> <p>Border counties are experiencing a different pattern of cases compared with much of the rest of the Republic. The border county of Cavan now has the <a href=\"https://www.thesun.ie/news/5365481/coronavirus-in-ireland-cavan-highest-number-per-100000/\">highest number of cases</a> relative to its population, even though it is only the 25th largest county by population in Ireland. Early on during the pandemic, it was reported that up to <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/coronavirus-in-ireland-cavan-general-calls-in-reinforcements-as-at-least-70-staff-go-off-sick-cr2grxdnm\">70 healthcare workers</a> in Cavan general hospital had contracted Covid-19, and there are also clusters of cases in residential-care settings in the region. While Dublin and its surrounding counties have been the worst affected, the border counties of Louth, Donegal and Monaghan have a higher rate of infection than those further south.</p> <p>The tendency to jump to a conclusion that the number of cases in border counties is related to the porous nature of the border itself, and so is a consequence of travel between north and south, may be misleading. We just don\u2019t know yet. Ireland\u2019s chief medical officer, Tony Holohan, who has cut a stoic figure throughout the crisis, has said it is unlikely that the high rate of infection in border counties is due to a \u201cspillover\u201d from the North.</p> <p>The public health doctor Gabriel Scally, president of the epidemiology and public health section of the Royal Society of Medicine, has said such hotspots require investigation. Scally lambasted the Department of Health in Northern Ireland on Twitter, saying the department \u201cis in deep and very hot water over their provision of statistics about Covid-19. I\u2019ve been very critical of their dreadful performance, and now the UK Statistics Authority have quite correctly, reprimanded them.\u201d He referenced a letter from Ed Humpherson, the director general for regulation at the statistics authority to Richard Pengelly, the permanent secretary of the Northern Ireland Department of Health, indicating that speculation about border cases is just one element of a wider issue about statistics related to the pandemic in the North.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/GabrielScally/status/1255904747883769856\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The Dept of Health in N Ireland is in deep and very hot water over their provision of statistics about <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID19?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#COVID19</a>.

The pandemic is many things, but it is political, and so too will be its consequences. The DUP showed that it was content to sacrifice the economic stability of Northern Ireland in pursuit of the empty, jingoistic rhetoric of Brexit, and at the outset of this pandemic, it did seem that public health was playing second fiddle to the party\u2019s lemming-like tendency to follow Westminster\u2019s instruction.</p> <p>Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il\u2019s recent (and vague) framework document for government formation, drafted as bait for the smaller parties they need to form their \u201cgrand coalition\u201d, having frozen Sinn F\u00e9in out of the process, tried on some of its policies, which essentially represent the mandate for \u201cchange\u201d voted for in the recent general election. One of the document\u2019s proposals is to establish a unit in the taoiseach\u2019s department \u201cto work towards a consensus on a united island\u201d, signifying a growing political case for a united Ireland, as well as something of an appeal to Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s massively increased voter base.</p> <p>Unexpected events often act as a catalyst for finding new pathways towards a goal. Nobody could have conceived that the case for a united Ireland would dovetail with the now urgent practicalities of a united approach to a public health crisis. But the big ideas we have about society often don\u2019t pan out how we anticipate. Eradicating the border\u2019s segmentation of two jurisdictions has been a peacetime issue, a Brexit issue and is now a public health issue.</p> <p>\u201cDisease knows no border. We have to work on all-island collective basis in what is an emerging crisis,\u201d O\u2019Neill said early on, a narrative that has continued through the course of the pandemic. \u201cIt\u2019s pure common sense that we need an all-island and a unified approach in dealing with this pandemic,\u201d Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s leader, <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/mary-lou-mcdonald-tests-positive-for-coronavirus-after-two-week-wait-1.4228544\">Mary Lou McDonald</a>, said on an RT\u00c9 radio programme, after she was praised for the low-key manner with which she dealt with a nasty bout of Covid-19, removing herself from the spotlight and only emerging when she recovered. And it\u2019s not just politicians proposing a unified Ireland in this context. The University of Limerick\u2019s professor of general practice, Liam Glynn, told the Irish Times, \u201cAnything other than an all-Ireland approach is bananas. We are an island.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 Una Mullally is a columnist for the Irish Times</p>",

The Berlin Wall fell when he was a teenager. He is now a professor at Johns Hopkins.</p> <p>So what are \u201cactive measures\u201d? Previously, Rid <a href=\"https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/sites/default/files/documents/os-trid-033017.pdf\">testified</a> they were \u201csemi-covert or covert intelligence operations to shape an adversary\u2019s political decisions\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cAlmost always,\u201d he explained, \u201cactive measures conceal or falsify the source.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/18/us/politics/mueller-report-document.html\">The special counsel\u2019s report</a> framed them more narrowly as \u201coperations conducted by Russian security services aimed at influencing the course of international affairs\u201d. Add in technology and hacking, and an image of modern asymmetric warfare emerges.</p> <p>Rid travels back to the early years of communist Russia, recounting the efforts of the government to discredit the remnants of the ancien r\u00e9gime and squash attempts to restore the monarchy. The Cheka, the secret police, hatched a plot that involved forged correspondence, a fictitious organization, a fake counter-revolutionary council and a government-approved travelogue.</p> <p>Words and narratives morphed into readily transportable munitions. The \u00e9migr\u00e9 community was declawed and the multi-pronged combination deemed \u201cwildly successful\u201d. The project also \u201cserved as an inspiration for future active measures\u201d. A template had been set.</p> <p>Fast forward to the cold war and the aftermath of the US supreme court\u2019s landmark school desegregation case. The tension between reality and the text and aspirations of the Declaration of Independence was in the open again. Lunch-counter sit-ins and demands for the vote filled newspapers and TV screens. The fault lines were plainly visible \u2013 and the Soviet Union pounced.</p> <p>In 1960, the KGB embarked on a \u201cseries of race-baiting disinformation operations\u201d that included mailing Ku Klux Klan leaflets to African and Asian delegations to the United Nations on the eve of a debate on colonialism. At the same time, Russian \u201coperators posed as an African American organization agitating against the KKK\u201d.</p> <p>More than a half-century later, Russia ran an updated version of the play. Twitter came to host <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/the-russians-manipulated-our-elections-we-helped/2020/04/23/e44e9e76-5742-11ea-9000-f3cffee23036_story.html\">the fake accounts</a> of both \u201cJohn Davis\u201d, ostensibly a gun-toting Texas Christian and family man, and @BlacktoLive\u201d, along with hundreds of others.</p> <p>The Internet Research Agency (IRA), a Russian troll factory, organized pro-Confederate flag rallies. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/18/us/politics/mueller-report-document.html\">As detailed by Robert Mueller</a>, the IRA also claimed that the civil war was not \u201cabout slavery\u201d and instead was \u201call about money\u201d, a false trope that continues to gain resonance among Trump supporters and proponents of the \u201cliberate the states\u201d movement. According to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d7aee844-88a0-11ea-a109-483c62d17528\">Brian Westrate</a>, treasurer of the Wisconsin Republican party, \u201cthe Confederacy was more about states\u2019 rights than slavery.\u201d</p> <p>Depicting West Germany as Hitler\u2019s heir was another aim. At the time, \u201csome aging former Nazis still held positions of influence\u201d, Rid writes. In the late 1960s, \u201cencouraging \u2018anti-German tendencies in the West\u2019 was very much a priority\u201d.</p> <p>In 1964, with Russian assistance, Czech intelligence mounted <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/uncovering-operation-neptun-the-cold-wars-most-daring-disinformation-campaign/\">Operation Neptun</a>, sinking <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/stb-neptun-90039/page/n21/mode/2up\">Nazi wartime documents</a> to the bottom of the ominous sounding Black Lake, near the German border. The cache was then \u201cdiscovered\u201d \u2013 media pandemonium ensued. Four years later the mastermind of the scheme, Ladislav Bittman, defected to the US.</p> <p>Prior to 2016, Russia\u2019s most notable active measure using the US as a foil was the lie that Aids was \u201cmade in the USA\u201d. In retaliation for US reports of Soviet use of chemical weapons in Afghanistan, the KGB unfurled Operation Denver, a multi-platformed campaign that falsely claimed \u201c<a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=lWltDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT352&amp;lpg=PT352&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q=\">Aids was an American biological weapon developed at Fort Detrick, Maryland</a>\u201d.

Trump\u2019s \u201cnavigable waters protection rule\u201d, which was published in January, narrows the definition of waterways to exclude ephemeral streams, wetlands, creeks and other headwaters which do not have visible water 365 days a year because they run intermittently or temporarily underground. For example, 90% of streams that connect to the Colorado river, which supplies water to seven western US states and two in northern Mexico, run only after rainfall or snowmelt.</p> <p>The rule, which has attracted widespread criticism from scientists, environmentalists, and the tourism sector, replaces an Obama era regulation that strengthened protection for about 60% of the nation\u2019s interconnected waterways. But it goes much further than just repealing Obama\u2019s 2015 rule, by allowing landowners and developers to dump directly into hundreds of thousands of waterways, and to destroy or fill in wetlands for construction projects.</p> <p>\u201cAccess to clean water is a fundamental right for all Americans. Trump\u2019s dirty water rule ignores the law and science and is a reckless rollback of clean water protections \u2026 which benefits industry polluters and harms countless Americans,\u201d said <strong>Letitia James</strong>, New York\u2019s attorney general, at a virtual press conference today.</p> <p>The lawsuit argues that the new rule will result in more pollution, flooding, and harm to fish and wildlife across the country \u2014 undermining decades of work to protect and enhance water resources - and will result in widespread economic losses.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going into this fight with our three most reliable allies: the facts, science and the law,\u201d said <strong>Xavier Becerra</strong>, California\u2019s attorney general. In California, more than 40% of streams and half of all wetlands have been stripped of protection under the new definition, said Becerra. \u201cEven during the coronavirus pandemic, the administration hasn\u2019t stopped.\u201d He added, \u201cThe latest actions come at a time when the nation\u2019s health and economy can least afford it.\u201d</p> <p>The lawsuit, co-led by New York and Califnronia, was filed today in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. Also suing are the attorneys generals of Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, Wisconsin, the District of Columbia and the City of New York.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/01/water-shutoffs-us-coronavirus-utilities-economy\">'It feels like nobody cares': the Americans living without running water amid Covid-19</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5eac76868f082b32fdd6bbf0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/martin-pengelly\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-01T19:39:01.134Z\">8.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Donald Trump has <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/01/trump-tells-biden-to-fight-tara-reade-sexual-assault-allegation.html\">passed further comment</a> on the <strong>allegation against Joe Biden</strong>, in an interview with Fox News commentator and podcast host Dan Bongino.</p> <p>\u201cI would just say to Joe Biden, \u2018Just go out and fight it,\u2019\u201d Trump said, adding in typically contradictory style: \u201cHe\u2019s gonna have to make his own decision, I\u2019m not going to be telling him what to do.

This never happened.'</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Joe Biden has emphatically denied a sexual assault allegation against him, breaking weeks of silence to address the accusation that has roiled his campaign. </p> <p>\u201c<strong>They aren\u2019t true. This never happened</strong>,\u201d he said in a statement, released moments before his Friday appearance on Morning Joe. </p> <p>Tara Reade accused Biden of sexually assaulting her in the basement of an office building on Capitol Hill in 1993, when she was an aide in his Senate office. His campaign refuted the allegation in a statement, but this is Biden\u2019s first public comment on the accusation.</p> <p>He also calls on the National Archives to release any record of a complaint Reade said she filed. </p> <p>Here is the statement in its entirety: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>April was Sexual Assault Awareness Month. Every year, at this time, we talk about awareness, prevention, and the importance of women feeling they can step forward, say something, and be heard. That belief \u2013 that women should be heard \u2013 was the underpinning of a law I wrote over 25 years ago. To this day, I am most proud of the Violence Against Women Act. So, each April we are reminded not only of how far we have come in dealing with sexual assault in this country \u2013 but how far we still have to go.</p> <p>When I wrote the bill, few wanted to talk about the issue. It was considered a private matter, a personal matter, a family matter. I didn\u2019t see it that way. To me, freedom from fear, harm, and violence for women was a legal right, a civil right, and a human right. And I knew we had to change not only the law, but the culture. <br><br>So, we held hours of hearings and heard from the most incredibly brave women \u2013 and we opened the eyes of the Senate and the nation \u2013 and passed the law.<br><br>In the years that followed, I fought to continually strengthen the law. So, when we took office and President Obama asked me what I wanted, I told him I wanted oversight of the critical appointments in the Office on Violence Against Women at the Department of Justice and I wanted a senior White House Advisor appointing directly to me on the issue. Both of those things happened.<br><br>As Vice President, we started the \u201cIt\u2019s on Us\u201d campaign on college campuses to send the message loud and clear that dating violence is violence \u2013 and against the law. <br><br>We had to get men involved. They had to be part of the solution. That\u2019s why I made a point of telling young men this was their problem too \u2013 they couldn\u2019t turn a blind eye to what was happening around them \u2013 they had a responsibility to speak out. Silence is complicity. <br><br>In the 26 years since the law passed, the culture and perceptions have changed but we\u2019re not done yet.<br><br>It\u2019s on us, and it\u2019s on me as someone who wants to lead this country. I recognize my responsibility to be a voice, an advocate, and a leader for the change in culture that has begun but is nowhere near finished. So I want to address allegations by a former staffer that I engaged in misconduct 27 years ago.<br><br>They aren\u2019t true. This never happened.</p> <p>While the details of these allegations of sexual harassment and sexual assault are complicated, two things are not complicated. One is that women deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, and when they step forward they should be heard, not silenced. The second is that their stories should be subject to appropriate inquiry and scrutiny. <br><br>Responsible news organizations should examine and evaluate the full and growing record of inconsistencies in her story, which has changed repeatedly in both small and big ways. <br><br>But this much bears emphasizing.<br><br>She has said she raised some of these issues with her supervisor and senior staffers from my office at the time. They \u2013 both men and a woman \u2013 have said, unequivocally, that she never came to them and complained or raised issues. News organizations that have talked with literally dozens of former staffers have not found one \u2013 not one \u2013 who corroborated her allegations in any way. Indeed, many of them spoke to the culture of an office that would not have tolerated harassment in any way \u2013 as indeed I would not have.<br><br>There is a clear, critical part of this story that can be verified. The former staffer has said she filed a complaint back in 1993. But she does not have a record of this alleged complaint. The papers from my Senate years that I donated to the University of Delaware do not contain personnel files. It is the practice of Senators to establish a library of personal papers that document their public record: speeches, policy proposals, positions taken, and the writing of bills. <br><br>There is only one place a complaint of this kind could be \u2013 the National Archives. The National Archives is where the records are kept at what was then called the Office of Fair Employment Practices. I am requesting that the Secretary of the Senate ask the Archives to identify any record of the complaint she alleges she filed and make available to the press any such document. If there was ever any such complaint, the record will be there.<br><br>As a Presidential candidate, I\u2019m accountable to the American people. We have lived long enough with a President who doesn\u2019t think he is accountable to anyone, and takes responsibility for nothing. That\u2019s not me. I believe being accountable means having the difficult conversations, even when they are uncomfortable. People need to hear the truth.<br><br>I have spent my career learning from women the ways in which we as individuals and as policy makers need to step up to make their hard jobs easier, with equal pay, equal opportunity, and workplaces and homes free from violence and harassment. I know how critical women\u2019s health issues and basic women\u2019s rights are. That has been a constant through my career, and as President, that work will continue. And I will continue to learn from women, to listen to women, to support women, and yes, to make sure women\u2019s voices are heard.<br><br>We have a lot of work to do. From confronting online harassment, abuse, and stalking, to ending the rape kit backlog, to addressing the deadly combination of guns and domestic violence. <br><br>We need to protect and empower the most marginalized communities, including immigrant and indigenous women, trans women, and women of color. <br><br>We need to make putting an end to gender-based violence in both the United States and around the world a top priority. <br><br>I started my work over 25 years ago with the passage of the Violence Against Women Act. As president, I\u2019m committed to finishing the job.</p> </blockquote> <p>Read it <a href=\"https://medium.com/@JoeBiden/statement-by-vice-president-joe-biden-7a9593bd3012\">here</a>: </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-01T12:03:29.178Z\">at 1.03pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5eac004f8f08f76ffc19f64a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-01T11:59:37.376Z\">12.59pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Good morning \u2026</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>\u2026and welcome to another day of coverage of the coronavirus outbreak \u2013 and politics, both concerning the pandemic and tilted towards the election in November \u2013 in the US.</p> <p>The main news of the morning is that <strong>Joe Biden</strong>, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, will appear on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe to answer questions for the first time about <strong>an allegation of sexual assault against him</strong>. </p> <p>In advance of the interview, Biden issued a statement:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I recognize my responsibility to be a voice, an advocate, and a leader for the change in culture that has begun but is nowhere near finished.
