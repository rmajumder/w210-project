  "<p>So much for \u201cpresidential\u201d. Donald Trump reverted to his blame-casting, grievance-airing, media-bashing ways on Thursday in a press conference that started strangely and ended in an even weirder place.</p> \n<p>It was the same Trump who spent more than four years lambasting the \u201cfake news\u201d media as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/sep/07/donald-trump-war-on-the-media-oppo-research\">enemies of the people.</a> But now it was taking place during a global pandemic in which thousands of lives depend on trustworthy sources and reliable information.</p> \n<p>Despite the gravity of a situation that has earned comparisons to war, Trump began with a joke: \u201cI have to say I think with social distancing, that the media\u2019s been much nicer. I don\u2019t know what it is, all these empty, these inbetween chairs,\u201d \u2013 a reference to how reporters now space themselves out in the White House briefing room.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/19/coronavirus-drug-trump-confusion-malaria-treatment-readiness\">Trump sows confusion with claim coronavirus drug will be ready soon</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Trump added: \u201cI love it, it\u2019s so much nicer, but I shouldn\u2019t say that because you\u2019ll get me now.\u201d</p> \n<p>Stephen Hahn, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/coronavirus-dr-deborah-birx-hiv-aids\">Deborah Birx,</a> the response coordinator for the coronavirus task force, remained stony-faced behind him.</p> \n<p>The president continued to paint a sunny picture about clinical trials and economic recovery but, as reporters began to challenge him over the federal response to the crisis, his mood darkened.</p> \n<p>Questioned by an NBC News journalist about his recent claim that he recognised the outbreak as a pandemic before others did, Trump complained: \u201cWe were very prepared. The only thing we weren\u2019t prepared for was the media. The media has not treated it fairly.</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you how prepared I was. I called for a ban from people coming in from China long before anybody thought it was \u2013 in fact, it was your network, I believe they called me a racist because I did that.\u201d</p> \n<p>Bridling with indignation, he added: \u201cIt was many of the people in the room. They called me racist and other words because I did that, because I went so early.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"22f484aee9fddfa964d17489e7b39f86a5673380\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/22f484aee9fddfa964d17489e7b39f86a5673380/0_430_6493_3898/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Members of the media keep a mandated social distance as they wait for Donald Trump\u2019s briefing on the coronavirus response at the White House.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Members of the media keep a mandated social distance as they wait for Donald Trump\u2019s briefing on the coronavirus response at the White House.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: REX/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Mike Pence and the surgeon general, Jerome Adams, who is African American, remained expressionless behind him.</p> \n<p>Trump is accustomed to sycophancy from Pence and the others around him \u2013 phrases such as \u201cThe president has ordered\u201d and \u201cThe president directed\u201d. The reporters, however, did not get the memo. He seemed upset that they had the temerity to grill him about his frequent downplaying of the threat of the virus and failure to organise testing kits.</p> \n<p>Trump was asked about the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/18/politics/mario-diaz-balart-coronavirus/index.html\">first two cases of coronavirus</a> among members of Congress. He used it as an opportunity to chastise the gathered media. \u201cI don\u2019t know if they\u2019re sitting like you people are sitting. You\u2019re actually sitting too close.\u201d</p> \n<p>It was another of those occasions when no one is entirely sure whether Trump is joking. In any case, the reporters in the briefing room \u2013 which long ago was the <a href=\"http://www.whitehousemuseum.org/west-wing/press-briefing-room.htm\">White House swimming pool</a> \u2013 looked distinctly unamused.</p> \n<p>Trump went on: \u201cYou should really \u2014 we should probably get rid of about another 75, 80% of you. I have just two or three of you that I like in this room. I think that\u2019s a great way of doing it. We just figured a new way of doing it, but you\u2019re actually much too close. You two, you should leave immediately.\u201d</p> \n<p>This was pretty rich from a man who continues to shake hands and flout rules on social distancing, even on the White House podium. Last week, when it emerged that Trump had been at Mar-a-Lago with a Brazilian official who had tested positive for the virus, he reluctantly agreed to take a coronavirus test, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/14/trump-coronavirus-paid-sick-leave-unemployment-testing\">which came back negative.</a></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"f167207d-f90d-4942-bade-b0e653061cd6\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wDdyn4Kbffs?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cI got a test because you people were driving everybody crazy,\u201d he said. \u201cI had no symptoms but I had a test and my doctor told me don\u2019t get it, you don\u2019t need it, everybody said you don\u2019t need it, but I had it because the press was going crazy.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump has spent much of his presidency boasting about the economy; now it is suddenly a sore point. One reporter prefaced his question, \u201cRight now, the economy has essentially ground to a halt.\u201d</p> \n<p>Irritated, Trump butted in sarcastically: \u201cThanks for telling us, we appreciate it.\u201d</p> \n<p>The reporter continued his gloomy forecast and Trump snapped: \u201cGo ahead, what\u2019s the rest of your question, everybody in the room knows that.\u201d</p> \n<p>The president has been criticised for constantly using the xenophobic term \u201cChinese virus\u201d. A sharp-eyed photographer caught a picture of his notes, showing the word \u201ccorona\u201d was crossed out and replaced by \u201cChinese\u201d in handwritten black ink.</p> \n<p>The issue came up at the end of the briefing, but not as anyone had imagined. Chanel Rion, who works for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jun/15/oan-oann-fox-news-donald-trump\">pro-Trump One America News Network,</a> and recently speculated wildly that the coronavirus might have been created in a lab in North Carolina, asked: \u201cDo you consider the use of the term \u2018Chinese food\u2019 racist \u2013 because it\u2019s food that originates in China or has Chinese roots?</p> \n<p>Appreciating the gift, Trump replied: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s racist at all.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"148027c26c0e95da381306a9620d9f1eb4fcac5a\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/148027c26c0e95da381306a9620d9f1eb4fcac5a/702_1_3049_1830/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A detail of Donald Trump\u2019s notes show where the president has crossed out the word \u2018corona\u2019 and added in \u2018Chinese\u2019 in discussing the coronavirus crisis.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A detail of Donald Trump\u2019s notes show where the president has crossed out the word \u2018corona\u2019 and added in \u2018Chinese\u2019 in discussing the coronavirus crisis.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Rion, who last year took Trump\u2019s lawyer Rudy Giuliani to Ukraine <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2019/12/19/journalists-blast-one-america-news-series-giuliani-087893\">to spread baseless conspiracy theories,</a> wasn\u2019t done. \u201cOn that note, major left-wing news media, even in this room, have teamed up with Chinese Communist Party narratives, and they are claiming that you are racist for making these claims about \u2018Chinese virus\u2019.</p> \n<p>\u201cIs it alarming that major media players, just to oppose you, are consistently siding with foreign state propaganda, Islamic state radicalism, Latin gangs and cartels? And they work right here at the White House with direct access to you and your team.\u201d</p> \n<p>Finally, the Trump era had jumped the shark. He revelled in it. \u201cIt amazes me when I read the things that I read,\u201d he said. \u201cIt amazes me when I read the Wall Street Journal, which is always so negative. It amazes me when I read \u2013 the New York Times is not even \u2013 I barely read it. You know, we don\u2019t distribute it in the White House anymore, and the same thing with the Washington Post.</p> \n<p>\u201cBecause you see, I know the truth. And people out there in the world, they really don\u2019t know the truth. They don\u2019t know what it is. They use different slogans and different concepts for me almost every week trying to catch something.</p> \n<p>\u201cLast week, it was, oh, chaos. You see me, there\u2019s no chaos. No chaos. I\u2019m the one telling everybody to be calm. There\u2019s no chaos at the White House. We have unbelievable professionals. It\u2019s really \u2013 I mean, I think I came up with the term, I hope I came up with the term, but it is fake news. It\u2019s more than fake news, it\u2019s corrupt news.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump continued to gripe about media outlets not calling him and said Democratic governors have praised him. \u201cThis administration has done a great job, but the press is very dishonest.\u201d</p> \n<p>Rion chimed in: \u201cMore than dishonest. They\u2019re siding with state propaganda!\u201d</p> \n<p>Suddenly we were in the rightwing fever swamps of the internet. As Hahn and Birx looked on, betraying no emotion, Trump replied: \u201cI think they do. They are siding with China. They are doing things that they shouldn\u2019t be doing. They\u2019re siding with many others; China is the least of it.</p> \n<p>\u201cSo why are they doing this? You\u2019ll have to ask them. But if we had an honest media in this country, our country would be an even greater place.\u201d</p> \n<p>Minutes later, the self-styled \u201cwartime president\u201d was gone.

  "<p>Donald Trump has sown fresh confusion about the US government\u2019s response to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus</a> pandemic by claiming that a therapeutic drug will be available \u201calmost immediately\u201d \u2013 only to be contradicted by officials.</p> \n<p>In the latest measure to combat the spread of the virus, the State Department on Thursday issued a new alert urging Americans not to travel abroad under any circumstances and to return home if they are already abroad unless they plan to remain overseas</p> \n<p>The global level four warning was unprecedented as such alerts are generally reserved for specific countries embroiled in conflict, natural disasters or where Americans face specific risks.</p> \n<p>But the significant move came shortly after a worryingly rambling performance at Thursday\u2019s White House press conference, the president asserted that chloroquine, used to combat malaria, had been approved and would be made available by prescription.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/medical-workers-self-isolate-home-fears-coronavirus\">Medical workers self-isolate amid fears of bringing coronavirus home</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re doing great with the vaccines but there\u2019s still a long process, but the therapies are something we can move on much faster potentially,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cAnd the treatments that will be able to reduce the severity or duration of the symptoms \u2013 make people better.</p> \n<p>\u201cChloroquine, or hydroxychloroquine, this is a common malaria drug. It\u2019s also a drug used for strong arthritis \u2026 It\u2019s been around for a long time, so we know if things don\u2019t go as planned it\u2019s not going to kill anybody \u2026 It\u2019s shown very, very encouraging early results, and we\u2019re going to be able to make that drug available almost immediately.\u201d</p> \n<p>But minutes later, Stephen Hahn, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, cautioned that in fact chloroquine has not been approved for use against the coronavirus and must still be tested for its effectiveness and safety.</p> \n<p>Chloroquine \u201cis already approved, as the president said, for the treatment of malaria as well as arthritis condition\u201d, Hahn pointed out. \u201cThat\u2019s a drug that the president has directed us to take a closer look at as to whether an expanded use approach to that could be done to actually see if that benefits patients.</p> \n<p>\u201cAnd again, we want to do that in a setting of a clinical trial, a large pragmatic clinical trial to actually gather that information and answer that question that needs to be asked and answered.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported on Thursday 10,491 cases of coronavirus, an increase of 3,404 from its previous count. The death toll rose by 53 to 150, it said, the biggest one-day jump so far.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/totals\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The Trump administration has been widely condemned for its sluggish response, particularly to testing kits and medical equipment.

Last week the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits rose by 70,000.</p> \n<p>Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/trump-signs-coronavirus-bill-free-testing-paid-leave\">signed an aid package</a>, which the Senate approved earlier on Wednesday, that will guarantee free testing, paid sick leave to workers who fall ill, family leave for caregivers and food assistance for those in need.</p> \n<p>Asked if he would support the federal government moving to take an equity stake in companies that need bailouts, Trump replied: \u201cI do. I really do.\u201d</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cWe will be helping the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/16/us-airline-industry-seeks-50-billion-bailout-amid-coronavirus-pandemic\">airline industry</a>. We will be helping the cruise ship industry. We probably will be helping the hotel industry \u2026 There\u2019s a lot of executive power. If we don\u2019t have to use it, that would be a good thing, not a bad thing.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump also took a swipe at China, where the virus was first reported, musing: \u201cIf people would have known about it, could have been stopped in place, it could have been stopped where it came from, China.\u201d</p> \n<p>This prompted criticism from his presumptive rival in the presidential election, Democrat Joe Biden. His campaign said in statement: \u201cThe reality is, he did know about it and experts spent months trying to prompt Trump into action as he downplayed the growing threat of the virus and praised the Chinese government\u2019s bungled early response \u2013 at a time when Vice-President Biden warned him not to take their word about the disease.</p> \n<p>\u201cNow, as this crisis explodes on his watch, Trump is desperately lashing out to try to cover up his incompetence and mismanagement.\u201d</p> \n<p>In a series of bizarre riffs, Trump described social distancing as a \u201chot term\u201d now and chastised reporters for sitting too close together. He railed against the media for failing to give him credit for banning travel from China. \u201cI got a [coronavirus] test because you people were driving everybody crazy,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Trump has been condemned for using the <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&amp;cx=007466294097402385199:m2ealvuxh1i&amp;q=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/10/republicans-face-backlash-racist-labeling-coronavirus-china-wuhan&amp;sa=U&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjGgcLfl6foAhULlXIEHRDZB-8QFjAAegQIAhAC&amp;usg=AOvVaw1T36USnyIsJFTePQNIMhkF\">xenophobic term</a> \u201cChinese virus\u201d. In a profoundly weird finale, a reporter from the pro-Trump One America News Network asked: \u201cMr President, do you consider the term \u2018Chinese food\u2019 to be racist because it is food that originated from China?\u201d</p> \n<p>He answered: \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s racist at all.\u201d</p> \n<p>Unusually, Trump is not thought to have made contact with the House speaker, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/nancy-pelosi\">Nancy Pelosi</a>, the architect of his impeachment last year. Instead he has delegated negotiations to the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, who is said to have established a working relationship with Pelosi.</p> \n<p>On Thursday the Senate began work on a $1tn-plus package to stem the economic fallout of the pandemic. The majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said the bill would include direct financial assistance to Americans, lending to key industries including airlines and money for more medical equipment.</p> \n<p>\u201cThese are not ordinary policies. This is no ordinary time,\u201d McConnell said on the Senate floor. \u201cWe have to beat back this virus.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>The former Labour MP Bruce George, who has died aged 77, had a profound belief in the need for a strong defence of the UK and chaired the Commons defence select committee throughout the first two parliaments of the Blair government. Although his views on defence issues were not those of the Labour party mainstream, he was widely respected and admired by his parliamentary colleagues in all parties as a politician of immense diligence and decency.</p> <p>He sat on the backbenches as the MP for Walsall South for 36 years until his retirement in 2010. While he never won political promotion at Westminster, he nevertheless secured international recognition for his work as part of the UK delegation to Nato for 29 years and of the assembly of the OSCE (Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe), of which he was a member from 1992 until 2010, and of which he was elected president for two years from 2002.</p> <p>He was also popular in his West Midlands constituency because he was accessible as an MP with a hands-on approach to dealing with local problems.</p> <p>George regarded the select committee system at Westminster as \u201cthe jewel in the crown of our legislature\u201d because it provided a means to hold any government to account. After first winning his seat in February 1974, he was appointed to the defence select committee in 1979, when the new system was introduced, and would later tell a Commons debate in 1992 that a properly functioning and financed select committee system could help redress the inexorable decline of the legislature. \u201cIf we simply allow the government to get away with telling us what to do and tinkering with the existing system, we shall deserve to slip even further into political impotence,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He remained a member of the committee until he was obliged to stand down in 2005 because of a rule limiting the chairmanship to two parliamentary terms. It was a measure of his status in the post that he had been made a member of the privy council in 2001, a highly unusual mark of respect for a backbencher.</p> <p>He was born in Mountain Ash, Glamorgan, the only child of Edgar George, a former police officer who became the head of security for the National Coal Board in south Wales, and his wife Phyllis (nee Thomas). He won a place at the grammar school in Mountain Ash, studied for a BA in politics at the University College of Wales, Swansea, and, after two years working as an assistant lecturer in social studies at Glamorgan Polytechnic (now the University of Glamorgan, 1964-66), qualified for an MA at the University of Warwick.</p> <p>He lectured in politics at Manchester Polytechnic (now Manchester Metropolitan University, 1968-70) and as a senior lecturer at Birmingham Polytechnic (Birmingham City University) until winning Walsall South from the Conservatives in Labour\u2019s unexpected victory in the first 1974 election.</p> <p>In his maiden speech in the debate on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/03/lord-healey\" title=\"\">Denis Healey</a>\u2019s first budget as Labour chancellor, George described his constituency as one of the workshops in the heart of the country that had helped produce much of the wealth of the land, but of which there was very little evidence on the streets of Walsall, where in some areas 20% of his electorate faced unemployment. His speech evoked his background, raised as he had been in the socialist tradition of the valleys of south Wales.</p> <p>He had joined the Labour party there, while still an undergraduate in 1963, and his political commitment led him to contest the safe Conservative seat of Southport in the 1970 election. In a more practical demonstration of his political beliefs at that time, from 1970 he also worked as a part-time lecturer for the newly established Open University when the first students were enrolled.</p> <p>He cut an amiable, if somewhat shambolic, figure in the corridors of the Commons. He seemed to personify the polytechnic lecturer from an early <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/1995/oct/23/fiction.kingsleyamis\" title=\"\">Kingsley Amis</a>\u2019 novel: he was a big man, untidy and dishevelled and always carrying paperwork. He had a voracious appetite for reading and his parliamentary office was remarkable for the quantity of books and papers he had piled on every surface. Even after election as an MP he worked as a visiting lecturer at the University of Essex (1985-86) and as a visiting professor at the University of Portsmouth (from 2009).</p> <p>He had a wide range of international interests, was a member of a number of parliamentary international groups and published numerous books and articles on defence and foreign affairs. He turned out regularly for the Commons Football Club, of which he was a joint founder, supported Walsall FC and played snooker. He was an unpaid consultant to the Confederation of Long Distance Pigeon Racing Associations, loved Gilbert and Sullivan and, suffering himself from psoriasis, was vice-president of the <a href=\"https://www.psoriasis-association.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Psoriasis Association</a>.</p> <p>He married Lisa Toelle in 1992 when he was 50, and his marriage brought him much contentment in later life. He decided to stand down as an MP before the 2010 election, saying that being an MP was like being married twice over \u2013 to a constituency as well as a partner \u2013 and he felt his wife deserved more of his time. He took pride in the official finding that he had \u201cno issues\u201d in the expenses scandal that rocked his last years at Westminster and, after his retirement, in the award of the Freedom of Walsall, the Order of Honour from the republic of Georgia for his role in overseeing their progress towards democracy and the OSCE medal for his contribution towards its mission.</p> <p>His wife survives him.</p> <p>\u2022 Bruce Thomas George, politician, born 1 June 1942; died 24 February 2020</p>",

But at least we\u2019ll know how many people have coronavirus, you know?\u201d</p> <p>For example, on Wednesday, Kevin Durant of the Brooklyn Nets revealed he tested positive, which means players from at least the Jazz, Pistons and Nets have the virus. \u201cIt\u2019s going around to all the NBA teams \u2013 except the Knicks,\u201d said Noah, \u201cbecause not even corona wants to be on the Knicks.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/mar/17/stephen-colbert-special-social-distancing-edition-bathtub-trevor-noah\">Stephen Colbert tapes 'special social-distancing edition' from bathtub</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Meanwhile, Trump has insisted on calling coronavirus, AKA Covid-19, the \u201cChinese virus\u201d, a racist choice he defended in a press conference on Wednesday. \u201cYou know Trump is the only person who could hold a press conference about a pandemic and then turn it into a fight about racism,\u201d said Noah. \u201cWho does that?\u201d</p> <p>Finally, Noah addressed the surge in ER visits from non-emergency young people. \u201cDoctors need our help,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cthe hospitals are overwhelmed. They can\u2019t handle that. Like, I know they\u2019ve shut down the bars, so maybe you think the ER is the hot new hangout, but it\u2019s not, people.

This is a crisis that we have to face together by staying as far apart as possible.\u201d</p> <p>Despite coronavirus, three Democratic primaries were held yesterday in Arizona, Illinois and Florida. \u201cStrangely, not that big of a story today,\u201d said Colbert. \u201cIt\u2019s like the equivalent of two old men playing Monopoly while their house burns down. Technically yes, somebody won, but that\u2019s not really what we\u2019re talking about the next day.\u201d Biden won all three states handily, with a 40-point margin in Florida. \u201cHe dominated every major Florida demographic: seniors, snake-owners, meth addicts, senior meth-addict snakes,\u201d joked Colbert.</p> <p>As the Late Show team prepared to take a scheduled week off, Colbert signed off with a hopeful message: \u201cIf there\u2019s one good thing that might come out of this crisis, I think it\u2019s that in this seemingly divided nation, people are doing their best to protect the country\u2019s collective wellbeing.

  "<p>James Alefantis first learned about the conspiracy theory surrounding his pizzeria from a reporter\u2019s phone call. In the waning days of the 2016 election, Will Sommer, then of the Washington City Paper in DC, had been following a thread on the site Reddit in which leaked emails from the Clinton campaign adviser John Podesta were used to justify an elaborate, and entirely false, story of a Clinton-run child abuse ring in the back of Comet Ping Pong pizza. Alefantis had never heard of the faux online hysteria and assumed, as he recalled in HBO\u2019s new documentary After Truth: Disinformation and the Cost of Fake News, that \u201ceverybody is up about this election and passions are high \u2013 I\u2019m sure this will go away in a couple of days\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/feb/03/mcmillions-bizarre-story-how-one-man-stole-24m-mcdonalds-hbo\">McMillions: the bizarre story of how one man stole $24m from McDonald's</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It did not go away. The ludicrous theory, known as <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/05/business/media/comet-ping-pong-pizza-shooting-fake-news-consequences.html\">Pizzagate</a>, was picked up and propagated by infamous conspiracy monger Alex Jones, and disseminated on Facebook and Twitter. Harassment of Comet and its staff escalated: one-star Yelp reviews appeared with references to child dungeons. Pictures of Alefantis posted to Instagram of his godchildren were repurposed to attack him as a pedophile, with specific, hateful references to his identity as a gay man. Prank callers issued death threats. And then, on 4 December 2016, Edgar Welch, a 28-year-old man from North Carolina, convinced from online forums that he had to find the children himself, entered the pizzeria <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/05/business/media/comet-ping-pong-pizza-shooting-fake-news-consequences.html\">with an AR-15</a>.</p> <p>No one was hurt and Welch was arrested, but the episode underscored the terrifying power of conspiracy theories and fake news articles, cultivated in forums such as Reddit and 4chan and propagated by Facebook and Twitter, to metastasize offline, with dire consequences. \u201cI don\u2019t think you can understand Pizzagate until you see that bodycam footage from the DC metro police that we have in the first 20 minutes of this film,\u201d Brian Stelter, host of CNN\u2019s Reliable Sources and an executive producer of After Truth, told the Guardian. \u201cIt shows how average Americans can be radicalized by insane content on the internet and can be motivated to get in a car with a gun and go confront people at a pizzeria.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLi7cNAJKA8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GLi7cNAJKA8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>After Truth tracks the influence of disinformation \u2013 a deliberately disseminated falsehood, as opposed to \u201cmisinformation\u201d, which is an unintentional factual error \u2013 from a niche topic in 2015 through Russian weaponization in the 2016 election and ubiquity in the Trump presidency. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at some of the biggest lies that continue to manipulate people\u2019s imaginations, even after they\u2019ve been thoroughly debunked and clarified,\u201d Andrew Rossi, the director, told the Guardian. Though the term \u201cfake news\u201d dates back to 2014 \u2013 when BuzzFeed News\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/i-helped-popularize-the-term-fake-news-and-now-i-cringe\">Craig Silverman popularized it</a> to describe false stories about the Ebola crisis \u2013 After Truth begins in 2015, with online conspiracies around a military drill in Bastrop county, Texas. Known as <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2018/05/03/hysteria-over-jade-helm-exercise-texas-was-fueled-russians-former-cia-/\">Jade Helm</a>, the theories, harnessed by YouTube personalities, spilled into the town\u2019s real life \u2013 now eerie footage depicts an army spokesperson shouted down by people who dismiss his reassurances as propaganda; instead, they believed an internet personality-driven theory that underground tunnels connected the town\u2019s Walmarts to the military base. The hysteria caught Texas governor Greg Abbott\u2019s attention, who treated it seriously. Russia took notice, and started replicating the pattern heading into America\u2019s election year.</p> <p>Beginning the arc in 2015 was deliberate \u2013 \u201cthis is bigger than any one president or term in office,\u201d said Stelter \u2013 but disinformation certainly ramped up in unison with Donald Trump\u2019s rise to the Republican nomination and, eventually, the presidency. His weaponization of the term \u201cfake news\u201d against legitimate news outlets in January 2017 represented \u201ca signal moment\u201d, said Stelter. \u201cThe president took the term and exploited it for his own political gain. Now, it\u2019s the world\u2019s worst game of whack-a-mole.\u201d</p> <p>After Truth seeks to put a face on the generally amorphous, sterile concept of disinformation, whether that be the pizzeria owner hounded by internet trolls or the frustratingly human role of prejudice and hate as \u201ca foundation for fake stories and as a magnet for people who feel aggrieved to channel their confusion with the world and their disappointment into demonizing a group\u201d, said Rossi. Comet Ping Pong was targeted as an LGBTQ+ safe space, for example; the Barack Obama birtherism theory in the early 2010s, of which Trump was a vocal proponent, was transparently racist.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d70c89e3a676db9b81e0be07e40624dec20bcb3d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d70c89e3a676db9b81e0be07e40624dec20bcb3d/0_0_1920_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James Alefantis, owner of Comet Ping Pong\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Alefantis, owner of Comet Ping Pong.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For Comet, there was a somewhat happy ending: loyal customers rallied around the business, keeping it open. The same cannot be said for the family of Seth Rich, a 27-year-old Democratic National Committee (DNC) staffer killed in an unsolved botched robbery in the summer of 2016. Rich\u2019s death became fodder for online conspiracy theorists, who baselessly linked the staffer to DNC emails actually leaked by Russia and claimed murder by the Clintons. The Fox News host Sean Hannity ran a primetime story boosting the Rich conspiracy, which the network later retracted (Hannity never apologized). Aaron Rich, speaking with Rossi, says fighting incessant trolls has left him unable to grieve his brother, even three years later.</p> <p>Whether it\u2019s Pizzagate, activating people into believing an outlandish pedophilia ring must be stopped, to Rich conspiracy theorists who feel they have access to privileged information, After Truth explores how much of disinformation\u2019s power lies in human emotion. \u201cFake stories are often successful when they capture their audience\u2019s hearts,\u201d said Rossi. \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do in the film is to provide a different story that also appeals to people\u2019s hearts, which is the pain and the devastation that\u2019s caused to the victims of these stories.\u201d</p> <p>Putting a face on disinformation, however, means also looking at its perpetrators; After Truth includes interviews with or footage of noted conspiracy theorists, hucksters or far-right media personalities, including Jones and Jack Burkman, a notoriously incendiary Washington lobbyist who hosted a press conference in 2018 with <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/2019/10/who-is-jacob-wohl-failed-smears.html\">bad-faith provocateur Jacob Wohl</a>, meant to smear Robert Mueller with a sexual assault allegation that fell apart, somewhat thrillingly, on Rossi\u2019s camera as the \u201cvictim\u201d elects not to show up.</p> <p>Talking to figures who believe all press is good press has been \u201cthe third rail of the project, and has been in the conversation among documentary film-makers who want to tackle this topic,\u201d said Rossi. \u201cHow do we do this without giving oxygen to the liars and propagandists?\u201d For Rossi, it was partly having someone like Burkman admit his cynicism, as in a 2017 interview in which he called disinformation a \u201ctool of war\u201d, like chemical weapons \u2013 if someone else can use it, he says, I may as well use it too. \u201cAnd then also to combine observational film-making with context, to immediately rebut a lie and debunk it in the moment.\u201d Journalists such as Silverman, CNN\u2019s Oliver Darcy, Recode\u2019s Kara Swisher and the New York Times\u2019s Adam Goldman debunk false claims in real time and add crucial context to the film\u2019s scope and timeline. \u201cIt\u2019s a delicate balance to strike,\u201d said Rossi, \u201cbut always make sure it\u2019s not misleading and the truth is very clear.\u201d</p> <p>Ultimately, according to Stelter, when it comes to dispersing or de-escalating disinformation, \u201cthere\u2019s no one solution, there\u2019s no one right answer\u201d. It\u2019s understanding media literacy 101, it\u2019s legislating responsibility for massive platforms of information, Facebook first among them. And in the midst of a once-in-a-generation pandemic in which correct, reliable information and public trust are now literally a matter of life and death, an understanding of the tools of disinformation may be more important than ever. \u201cDisinformation in the sense that our information world is polluted is something we all have in common,\u201d said Stelter. \u201cIt\u2019s something we all share, and it\u2019s a problem that we all collectively have to address.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>After Truth: Disinformation and the Cost of Fake News premieres on HBO on 19 March and will air in the UK at a later date</p></li> </ul>",

Her campaign speeches largely focused on the ills of American wars overseas, with Gabbard promising to redirect money from the military budget to social programs.</p> <p>As her campaign failed to gain momentum, however, Gabbard and her supporters increasingly criticized the media for failing to provide her with enough airtime \u2013 although the congresswoman never approached double figures in national polls.</p> <p>Gabbard was seen as a rising star in the Democratic party when she became a member of Congress in 2013, and was appointed a vice-chair of the Democratic National Committee.</p> <p>She resigned that position, however, to endorse Bernie Sanders over <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton\">Hillary Clinton</a> in 2016, and continued to chaff against her party when <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/04/11/what-is-tulsi-gabbard-thinking-on-syria/\">she met with the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad</a>, in 2017, later questioning the consensus that Assad was behind <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/04/world/middleeast/syria-gas-attack.html\">a chemical attack</a> that killed dozens of people.</p> <p>Despite backing Biden over Sanders, Gabbard thanked the Vermont senator in her announcement.</p> <p>\u201cI want to extend my best wishes to my friends Bernie Sanders, his wife Jane, Nina Turner and their many supporters for the work that they\u2019ve done,\u201d Gabbard said.

The feminist academic and writer spent almost 16 months inside Luzira prison in Uganda for writing a poem on Facebook about Ugandan president Yoweri Museveni\u2019s mother\u2019s vagina. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/stella.nyanzi/posts/10156527462740053?_rdc=1&amp;_rdr\">In the untitled poem</a>, she graphically described the vagina in grotesque terms (one line reads: \u201cI wish the lice-filled bush of dirty pubic hair overgrown all over Esiteri\u2019s unwashed chuchu had strangled you at birth\u201d), framing the president\u2019s emergence from the birth canal as a metaphor for his increasingly oppressive near 35-year rule.</p> <p>But Nyanzi came out of prison all guns blazing, head first into a tense political climate as Uganda\u2019s 2021 election looms closer; when she stepped out of the court in Kampala, she donned a tiara and a sash that read \u201cFUCK OPPRESSION\u201d and began to address crowds. When we meet weeks later, she\u2019s excited and speaks quickly; she wants to show people \u2013 particularly those \u201cinspired to write as boldly or even bolder than me\u201d \u2013 that imprisonment did not silence her.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/jan/17/jailed-ugandan-activist-stella-nyanzi-wins-freedom-of-expression-award-oxfam-pen-international\">\u2018You can't handcuff my spirit\u2019: jailed writer wins freedom of expression prize</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s good to be out, but it\u2019s not necessarily freedom,\u201d she says, gazing out over the shores of Lake Victoria. \u201cWhen I got a phone, everyone was saying, \u2018Do not [use] Facebook, do not tweet, don\u2019t write anything stupid.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018Fuck you, guys!\u2019\u201d She\u2019s shouting now, hands on hips: \u201cThey should say, \u2018Hey! Even after prison, she came back harder, stronger, more vulgar!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Nyanzi laid the groundwork for this long before her release. During a court appearance in August, via a video link from prison, she swore and stripped as the judge sentenced her to an extra nine months on top of her initial punishment, on charges of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/aug/02/activist-who-branded-uganda-president-a-dirty-delinquent-dictator-faces-jail-yoweri-museveni-cyber-harassment\">cyber</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2019/aug/02/activist-who-branded-uganda-president-a-dirty-delinquent-dictator-faces-jail-yoweri-museveni-cyber-harassment\">harassing</a> Museveni. Her release in February followed a successful challenge by her legal team.</p> <p>While in prison, Nyanzi released a poetry collection, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/No-Roses-My-Mouth-Political-ebook/dp/B084F7MHJX\">No Roses </a><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/No-Roses-My-Mouth-Political-ebook/dp/B084F7MHJX\">from My Mouth</a>, made up of 158 poems she wrote behind bars. With sections dedicated to prison, feminism and Uganda, the collection includes poems as explicit as the piece of writing for which she was imprisoned. She has been described as employing \u201cradical rudeness\u201d \u2013 an activist tactic with roots in Uganda\u2019s anti-colonial resistance movement, which uses public insult and naked protest to disrupt social norms and criticise those in power. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d44154eaa3fdf3cc5c23f0d80f7c514e47a2dabb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d44154eaa3fdf3cc5c23f0d80f7c514e47a2dabb/0_346_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"No Roses from My Mouth is a collection of 158 poems Nyanzi wrote in prison.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I wrote on my body, on the walls, in the toilets, on leaves\u2019 ... No Roses from My Mouth is a collection of 158 poems Nyanzi wrote in prison.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Luke Dray/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Nyanzi estimates that half of her poems were confiscated by guards, including a collection about solitary confinement she wrote in an exercise book. \u201cI wrote on my body, on the walls, in the toilets, on leaves,\u201d she says. Despite losing so much, she believes poetry was a practical tool of resistance: \u201cA poem can be short. It can be a little piece of paper stuck inside the bra. On five pages you can have 20 poems,\u201d she says, going through the different methods she used to smuggle her words out of prison, such as hiding pages inside the traditional woven mat she sat on when people visited her.</p> <p>Nyanzi clearly feels indebted to those who worked to get her poems out of prison and into a published book \u2013 despite arriving at our interview holding a copy labelled \u201ccorrections\u201d in red marker. (\u201cWe cannot win any struggle if we can\u2019t spell right!\u201d she says.)</p> <p>Before prison, Nyanzi always wrote poetry for herself; inside, she says, it became a way for her to make sense of what she and others around her were experiencing. \u201cIt was so, so much. Somebody is dying there, someone is pregnant here, someone is being beaten there,\u201d she says. \u201cThese intense moments were always there.\u201d</p> <p>One poem, The Mango Seller, describes a woman who has arrived in prison after being arrested for selling mangos on the street. Nyanzi paints an unflattering picture \u2013 her \u201cscary\u201d eyes, knotted hair and snotty nose \u2013 but contrasts this with her pain and fragility. \u201cI am here in prison crying for my baby,\u201d the mother says; she has been separated from her eight-month-old child, who she left with her neighbour that morning while she went to sell mangos by the roadside. Unable to afford the fine for operating without a licence, she was sent on a bus to prison.</p> <p>Nyanzi\u2019s own trauma is also explored in the book, including several devastating tributes to the baby she miscarried in prison. There is also a poem about a lesbian relationship between inmates, and an intersex prisoner who Nyanzi describes as \u201ca man, a woman, a fabulous person / How you confuse gender rigidities!\u201d</p> <p>An anthropologist by profession, Nyanzi is known for her studies of, and allyship with, marginalised groups, such as the sex worker and LGBT+ communities. Her research was controversial in Uganda\u2019s conservative society before she went to prison; she wonders if this may have contributed to the loss of her position at Makerere University, a decision she is still battling in a civil court. While Nyanzi says she has academic colleagues who support her, none would testify for her in court.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"93f2e86c4a6a5342fea4d6e54d5e5aad0f4b5939\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/93f2e86c4a6a5342fea4d6e54d5e5aad0f4b5939/0_112_2368_1420/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yoweri Museveni in February.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I have nothing against the man, but this dictatorship must be represented by an \u201cit\u201d\u2019 ...

The two have family in the same area of Uganda and she says she would politely greet him if they met. \u201cI have nothing personal against the man,\u201d she laughs. \u201cBut this dictatorship must be represented by an \u2018it\u2019.\u201d She says she even admires Museveni\u2019s use of language, full of \u201cmetaphors and proverbs and riddles\u201d such as <a href=\"https://www.observer.ug/news-headlines/41737-mbabazi-thugs-stuck-a-finger-in-a-leopard-s-anus-museveni\">describing</a> anti-government protesters as putting their lands \u201cin the anus of a leopard\u201d - a phrase Nyanzi uses back at him in her poetry, by describing herself as \u201cpoking the leopard\u2019s anus.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s a snake and a bastard and a bitch and a murderer and all those things, but he\u2019s also very funny,\u201d she says. \u201cLike, really-clever-brilliant funny.\u201d </p> <p>While Nyanzi makes jokes about inviting Museveni for a live poetry standoff, she knows she needs rest. She has collapsed several times since being released from jail, due to a condition that has now been diagnosed as trauma-induced.</p> <p>\u201cI am thinking I need to go for warm baths, and to sit in rustic overgrown gardens,\u201d she smiles \u2013 although she then lays out her jam-packed schedule. It\u2019s hard to understand when she will find time to relax. Yet since her release she continues to find solace in poetry, particularly listening to the work of young writers in Kampala at spoken-word events. She speaks animatedly about a recent university poetry slam she went to with her 15-year-old daughter, on the theme of sexual consent.</p> <p>\u201cBecause I have teenagers in my house, I have access to kids doing poetry events,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s very soothing, music and poetry, percussion and poetry. It\u2019s helping me to cope.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Indonesia\u2019s president, Joko Widodo, has acknowledged the need to immediately ramp up testing for the coronavirus following criticism of the response to the outbreak in the world\u2019s fourth most populous country.</p> \n<p>Concerns have been raised over the country\u2019s surveillance measures, its transparency and failure to clamp down on mass religious gatherings despite a wave of infections across south-east Asia.</p> \n<p>Following confusion over the death toll in the country, it was announced on Thursday that the number of fatalities had risen from 19 to 25.</p> \n<p>The number of tests carried out has increased significantly from the 220 completed just over a week ago, leading to a rise in identified cases. On Thursday, 82 more patients were confirmed to have the virus, the country\u2019s biggest daily increase yet, bringing the total to 309.</p> \n<p>Indonesia did not record a single confirmed case <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/02/first-coronavirus-cases-confirmed-in-indonesia-amid-fears-nation-is-ill-prepared-for-outbreak\">until 2 March</a>. Officials have previously rejected suggestions that cases were going undetected in the country.</p> \n<p>On Thursday, Widodo said mass testing was needed and he would introduce drive-through tests. \u201cI ask that the number of testing kits and the number of test centres are increased and we get more hospitals involved,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Last weekend, Widodo admitted that some information relating to cases had been withheld, saying: \u201cWe have to think of the possibility that the public will react to it by panicking or worrying.\u201d</p> \n<p>The president has previously rejected calls to impose a lockdown in hard- hit areas of Indonesia, despite the Philippines and Malaysia introducing restrictions, and he has apparently blocked attempts by regional leaders in East Java to impose containment measures.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/asia\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>There have been calls to halt religious gatherings in the country. On Wednesday evening, a large rally of Muslim pilgrims in South Sulawesi province was eventually called off after officials said it could fuel transmission. By the time it was cancelled, however, about 9,000 people had already travelled from across the country and beyond to attend the event.</p> \n<p>Regional police and local authorities had repeatedly stated that the four-day gathering should not go ahead, citing a similar meeting attended by 16,000 people in Malaysia that has contributed to hundreds of infections in the country and been linked to cases elsewhere across the region.</p> \n<p>On Thursday morning, medical teams began screening thousands of people who had travelled to the event in South Sulawesi. More than 400 people from nine other countries including Malaysia, Singapore and Saudi Arabia will be isolated at a hotel, while pilgrims from other regions of Indonesia will be quarantined at a government dormitory.</p> \n<p>In the province of East Nusa Tenggara, officials failed to prevent about 1,500 people from gathering for a ceremony to inaugurate a new Catholic bishop. </p> \n<p>In Jakarta, Friday prayers were expected to go ahead at Istiqlal, the biggest mosque in south-east Asia.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/totals\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>This week, Indonesia\u2019s most important Muslim body issued a fatwa stating that people in areas with a \u201chigh or very high transmission potential\u201d should not attend Friday prayers but others should do so. It is feared that such advice will prove unhelpful given that testing levels remain low.</p> \n<p>\u201cOur fatwa is not aimed at preventing corona, the government is the one who [has to] prevent the corona. Our fatwa is to give guidance on how to worship when there is a corona outbreak,\u201d Muhammad Cholil Nafis, the Indonesia Ulema Council\u2019s head of Islamic preaching, told the Guardian.</p> \n<p>In Bali, Hindu purification ceremonies held on beaches before Nyepi \u2013 silent day, in the ancient Balinese calendar \u2013 will be attended by limited numbers of people, probably thousands spread across beaches and other sites, said Ida Penglingsir Putra Sukahet, a member of the Adat village assembly.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe risk is there. But we always have to think, if we didn\u2019t carry out malasti [a religious procession to the sea for purification], the risk would be more terrible.

At the moment for us, that is not necessary in relation to schools. </p> \n   <p>We know from where the virus has broken out, very few kids get the illness. Those that get the illness are mainly mild, they don\u2019t appear to be transmitting between children, in fact it\u2019s more likely that children will get it from their own parents and other people in their households. </p> \n   <p>Closing schools, we know, does cause a major disruption to society and to families in particular.

However, pregnant women are potentially at increased risk of complications from any respiratory disease due to the physiological changes that occur in pregnancy. These include reduced lung function, increased oxygen consumption and changed immunity.</p> \n   <p><strong>Currently there is no evidence of an increased risk of miscarriage, teratogenicity or vertical transmission of the Covid-19 virus. There is a possibility of an increased incidence of premature birth but there is insufficient evidence at this point in time</strong>.</p> \n   <p>RANZCOG recommends that, where possible, pregnant healthcare workers be allocated to patients, and duties, that have reduced exposure to patients with, or suspected to have, Covid-19 infection. </p> \n   <p>All personnel should observe strict hygiene protocols and have full access to Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). </p> \n   <p>The college also urges employers to be sensitive to the fact that pregnant women are, appropriately, often anxious about their own health and protective of their unborn baby. Consideration should be given to reallocation to lower-risk duties, working from home or leave of absence.</p> \n   <p>The current circumstances are unprecedented. The community will rely on the medical system to function at the highest level and near 100 percent participation of the medical, nursing and midwifery workforce. Specialist practitioners may need to re-allocate to other areas of the medical system. The college expresses our deep and sincere gratitude to our members, all doctors, nurses, midwives and other health care workers, the administrative staff and management of our hospitals and health services for their dedication, professionalism and compassion.</p> \n   <p>RANZCOG recognises that decisions around resource allocation are complex, and multifactorial, and defers to local jurisdictions in this regard.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-19T00:58:10.170Z\">at 12.58am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e72bf428f085e564ad86ca7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/melissa-davey\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-19T00:39:43.405Z\">12.39am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The <strong>Australian Health Protection Principal Committee</strong>, comprised of all chief health officers and chaired by the chief medical officer, <a href=\"https://www.health.gov.au/news/australian-health-protection-principal-committee-ahppc-coronavirus-covid-19-statement-on-17-march-2020\">has published</a> the rationale behind its latest recommendations, including that schools remain open for now. Of course, this advice may change \u2013 school closures are not permanently off the table.</p> \n  <p>The committee says there is currently l<strong>imited information on the contribution of children to transmission of Covid-19</strong>. The World Health Organization found in China 2.4% of total reported cases were under the age of 19 years old. Worldwide, very few cases of infection in children have been severe or critical. The committee says;</p> \n  <p><em>\u201cThis contrasts distinctly with the severity pattern observed with other respiratory viruses, where young children are particularly at risk of severe disease.<br><br>\u201cPrevious studies suggest that the potential reduction in community transmission from pre\u2011emptive school closures may be offset by the care arrangements that are in place for children who are not at school. <strong>Children may require care from older carers who are more vulnerable to severe disease, or may continue to associate (and transmit infection) outside of school settings.</strong><br><br>\u201cBroadly, the health evidence on school closures from previous respiratory epidemics shows the costs are often underestimated and the benefits are overestimated. This may be even more so in relation to Covid-19 as, unlike influenza, the impact on otherwise healthy children has been minimal to date.<br><br>\u201cSchool closure is associated with considerable costs. S<strong>tudies have estimated that around 15% of the total workforce and 30% of the healthcare workforce may need to take time off work to care for children. This burden will be significant and will fall disproportionately on those in casual or tenuous work circumstances</strong>.<br><br>\u201cAt this stage, the spread of Covid-19 in the community is at quite low levels. It may be many months before the level of Australian community infection is again as low as it is at the moment. For pre-emptive school closures to be effective, closure for at least several months is required and it would be unclear when they could be reopened.<br><br><strong>\u201dSchool closures for shorter defined periods may be considered as part of a suite of more stringent distancing measures later in the outbreak, in anticipation of a peak in infection rates.</strong><br><br>\u201cShort term reactive school closure may also be warranted to allow cleaning and contact tracing to occur in response to an outbreak in a given school.<br><br>More than 70 countries around the world have implemented either nationwide or localised school closures, at different times in the evolution of the local Covid-19 epidemic, h<strong>owever it should be noted the majority of these have not been successful in controlling the outbreak. </strong>Some of these countries are now considering their position in relation to reopening schools.\u201d</em></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-19T00:42:50.506Z\">at 12.42am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e72bee58f085e564ad86ca5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-19T00:39:10.058Z\">12.39am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Tasmanian business community are in support of the decision to shut the island\u2019s borders.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/emlybkr/status/1240413023912615936\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">TCCI endorsing today\u2019s announcement on Tas borders, says it\u2019s probably the biggest decision of Premier Peter Gutwein\u2019s political career <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/politas?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#politas</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/covid19tas?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#covid19tas</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/NNXFnHtamG\">pic.twitter.com/NNXFnHtamG</a></p>\u2014 Emily Baker (@emlybkr) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/emlybkr/status/1240413023912615936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 18, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Tasmania was not impacted by the Spanish flu pandemic, from a health standpoint.

The letter says if members are concerned by the recommendations of the AHPPC, they should take it directly to the committee rather than \u201cchallenge, undermine or create uncertainty\u201d by criticising the committee publicly through media.<br><br>However, <strong>some health professionals on social media criticised the letter, </strong>saying it suggests political overlay and that health professionals should not be criticised for challenging a public body.<br><br>The CEO of the PHAA, <strong>Terry Slevin, </strong>told Guardian Australia that no politician or AHPPC member had directed the letter be sent. He said while the PHAA received some funding from government ($375,000 per year), it was independent.<br><br>\u201cThis letter was about encouraging members to draw on the evidence and the advice of the AHPPC and the chief health officers because they are being informed by people with very technical, high-level expertise,\u201d he said. \u201cThe AHPPC has access to the best unfolding information in Australia and internationally and we think that needs to be recognised. That was the primary reason for the letter.\u201d</p> \n  <p>He added that <strong>members of the PHAA board were unpaid and many members had been working overtime</strong> trying to respond to the crisis. Slevin said he personally had forwarded members\u2019 concerns about government recommendations to the AHPPC.<br><br>\u201cThat does not mean there should not be debate and different public views,\u201d Slevin said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe are a professional association of people who volunteer and do work for free to benefit people.

The first daughter\u2019s social media posts have sparked a massive backlash, with many accusing Ivanka of being oblivious to the difficulties currently facing most working families.</p> <p>\u201cI have friends CRYING in their living rooms because they got laid off yesterday and don\u2019t know how they will pay their mortgage,\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Witches_RESIST/status/1239910810522136578?s=20\">one person tweeted</a>.</p> <p>Eighteen per cent of American workers have already been laid off or had their work hours cut because of the coronavirus, according to a <a href=\"http://maristpoll.marist.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/NPR_PBS-NewsHour_Marist-Poll_USA-NOS-and-Tables_2003151338.pdf#page=3\">survey</a>. Many parents aren\u2019t just worried about keeping their kids amused, they\u2019re worried about keeping them fed. Ivanka\u2019s posts make her seem like a modern-day Marie Antoinette. Except, instead of saying \u2018let them eat cake\u2019 she\u2019s tweeting \u2018let them build tents.\u2019</p> <p>Ivanka was also criticized for sharing glamour shots of her family \u201ccamping\u201d while migrants are crowded in unsanitary camps at the border. \u201cThinking of all the families separated forcefully by your father\u2019s policies today,\u201d congresswoman <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IlhanMN/status/1239966350937747456?s=20\">Ilhan Omar wrote</a>. \u201cShare your ideas on how you plan to unite them.\u201d</p> <p>While many liberals have dismissed Ivanka\u2019s #TogetherApart posts as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.rawstory.com/2020/03/ivanka-trump-shredded-for-tone-deaf-coronavirus-photo-op-moms-are-scrambling-for-childcare-right-now/\">tone deaf</a>\u201d, images of her at home playing the perfect mother while her husband is busy \u201csaving\u201d the world from coronavirus seem to be striking just the right note among some conservatives. Rightwing outlets have been quick to paint Ivanka as \u201cpro-family\u201d, while using the story as another excuse to attack Omar.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/omar-faces-backlash-for-response-to-ivanka-trumps-pro-family-coronavirus-message\">headline</a> from the conservative Washington Examiner, for example, reads: \u201cOmar faces backlash for response to Ivanka Trump\u2019s pro-family coronavirus message.\u201d</p> <p>Ivanka may have questionable governmental credentials, but she\u2019s got a lot of experience when it comes to optics. Far from being oblivious, her coronavirus content is arguably a calculated attempt to soften the Trump administration\u2019s image and project the image of good old-fashioned values.</p> <p>Not even a pandemic can stop Ivanka building her personal brand.</p>",
  "<p>The Trump administration is putting the health and potentially lives of thousands of federal judges, lawyers, court staff and undocumented immigrants and their families at risk by insisting that immigration courts remain open for the deportation hearings of detained immigrants, despite the threat of coronavirus.</p> <p>On Wednesday the Department of Justice <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DOJ_EOIR/status/1240124718298038273\">announced</a> the temporary closure of 10 immigration courts in addition to the already shuttered location in Seattle. All deportation hearings relating to undocumented people who are not in custody have also been suspended.</p> <p>But a rare alliance of federal employees including immigration judges, Ice prosecutors and lawyers representing immigrants are saying the changes are too little, too late. With 58 immigration courts still open across the country, and only 11 closed, the prospect of courthouses acting as incubators and disseminators of the virus remains pronounced, with the risk of spreading the disease to large numbers of federal employees and the public.</p> <p>A judge working out of the immigration court in Denver, Colorado, is understood to have contracted Covid-19. The Denver court is one of the 58 ordered to remain open.</p> <p>Judge Samuel Cole, communications director of the National Association of Immigration Judges (NAIJ), told the Guardian that the new restrictions were helpful but not enough. \u201cThere are still hearings going on across the country in courts that need to be closed because they are a public safety hazard.\u201d</p> <p>Staff in federal courts have been making increasingly desperate appeals to the Trump administration to abide by the guidelines set by its own disease control agency and temporarily close all immigration courts. But they have repeatedly been told that hearings must continue.</p> <p>It appears that amid the crisis over the coronavirus pandemic, Donald Trump is putting his desire to stand tough on immigration in an election year ahead of protecting the lives of government workers and the public. The instruction to keep going with immigration removal hearings of detained individuals issued by the DoJ has come from the top of the Trump administration, court employees have been told.</p> <p>Yet the approach directly conflicts with the guidance given by the government\u2019s own disease control agency. <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/Seattle_Community_Mitigation.pdf\">Latest advice</a> from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that individuals at risk of severe illness if they contract Covid-19 should avoid gatherings of 10 or more people. It also says that workplaces should \u201cencourage staff to telework\u201d.</p> <p>Yet deportation hearings for detained immigrants which frequently have 15 or so people holed up in closed-air courtrooms for several hours, must now carry on.</p> <p>\u201cPrioritizing politics above all else is incompatible with the principles of due process and is a danger to the health and security of all involved,\u201d Judge Ashley Tabaddor, president of the NAIJ, said before the new restrictions came into effect.</p> <p>Among the 10 courts that have been closed are three located in New York City that are among the busiest in the country. Court staff have been trying for days to persuade management to let them telework from home in line with CDC advice.</p> <p>A whistleblower working in the New York City immigration courts has shared with the Guardian details of how basic CDC guidelines have been flouted every day in the city\u2019s three immigration courts. Even after the announcement was made on Wednesday that the courts were closing, federal staff were told that they had to come into work for the rest of the week to \u201cassist with an orderly shutdown\u201d.</p> <p>The whistleblower said they were relieved the courts were being shuttered but they remained angry at how the issue has been handled. \u201cAt every turn when we brought up our concerns, management has downplayed and deflected responsibility. We could have been exposed for days, even weeks.\u201d</p> <p>They added: \u201cThere is no other reasonable explanation to risk these many people\u2019s lives other than that the Trump administration hates immigrants so much they want to get rid of them. That is abhorrent to me.\u201d</p> <p>In recent days members of the public have been showing up at the New York courts looking visibly unwell. Yet only the most basic hygiene measures have been taken, the whistleblower said.</p> <p>Security guards have been instructed to wipe surfaces clean in courtrooms and waiting rooms where suspected coronavirus cases have been present. \u201cThat\u2019s the extent of the deep-cleaning of immigration courts,\u201d the whistleblower said.</p> <p>Around the country, courts that must remain open to hear detained deportation cases are already experiencing shortages of cleaning supplies to sanitize courtrooms forcing federal employees to provide their own. Interpreters needed to translate for immigrants in removal hearings were being flown from high-risk areas where Covid-19 is already prevalent such as New York to less at-risk states, thereby potentially spreading the disease.</p> <p>\u201cThat contradicts everything we are being told by health experts and the CDC,\u201d said Judge Amiena Khan, NAIJ\u2019s executive vice-president. \u201cHow in God\u2019s name is flying interpreters around the country helping to combat this global pandemic?\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this week the unions and professional bodies of immigration judges, Ice prosecutors and lawyers representing undocumented clients issued a <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6811831-Immigration-Letter.html\">joint statement</a> calling for the immediate suspension for up to a month of all of the nation\u2019s 68 immigration courts. The groups called the measures taken so far \u201cwoefully insufficient \u2026 The DOJ is failing to meet its obligations to ensure a safe and healthy environment within our immigration courts.\u201d</p> <p>Federal employees are being asked to make unconscionable choices, as illustrated by the battles waged in the New York courts. The whistleblower personally has a respiratory condition that means that were they to contract the virus they could be in mortal danger.</p> <p>Numerous requests to telework from home had been turned down, forcing the whistleblower to travel into court every day on the New York subway \u2013 a perilous exercise in itself. Yet they feel unable to disobey because if they lost their job they would also lose healthcare coverage which would make them all the more vulnerable.</p> <p>\u201cThe choice that all of us federal employees are being presented is you come to work and you get healthcare coverage or you start taking days off and your supervisor doesn\u2019t like it and you risk being fired without healthcare coverage,\u201d they said.</p>",

But in his latest update he pointed out that Greenland is still waiting for the test results from nine other patients to be analysed in Denmark which controls the island.

We have been told test results will take five to ten days. People have contacted the hospital, but for the most part they are still advising that testing is not necessary unless you have travelled. We do not know if the virus is here. I believe we have one person in self isolation who felt unwell after travelling from the UK, but again that has not officially been confirmed.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The reader said there was also alarm on the Falklands about the limited hospital capacity if coronavirus does hit. They said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>A key concern is the ability of the hospital to cope. In total the island\u2019s hospital has 29 beds, seven of which are used for long term care for the elderly already. There are two intensive care beds. Usually if anyone needs critical or specialist care they are flown out to South America or the UK, which is clearly not going to be an option with coronavirus cases. The government raised the possibility that even regular emergency cases might not be accepted by our partners countries if their health systems are already overwhelmed.</p> \n   <p>Many of our medical staff are here on short term contracts, recruited from the UK (or occasionally other countries, we have had several doctors from Canada lately) to work for for 3 to 6 months at a time. Falkland Islanders are concerned what will happen when contracts end and if we will be able to replace those who leave.</p> \n   <p>The other key concern has been tourists coming in. Cruise ship tourists regularly outnumbering the population during the peak season. The season is coming to an end, which should help reduce exposure, but as of today there are still several ships heading here that were reportedly turned away from Punta Arenas.</p> \n   <p>Falkland Islanders are strong, resilient people, but it does feel like the Falkland Island government has been caught unaware by the current outbreak. Updates are few and far between and the current policy to follow the UK\u2019s lead feels problematic given our geographic location and resources.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p><strong>Update</strong>: Madsen writes:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>A second person with Covid-19 in Nuuk has been confirmed. As of 16:00 this afternoon local time the shopping center \u201cNuuk Center\u201d will close, along with will bars, caf\u00e9s, restaurants and gyms.

The tone was always going to serious and sombre given the nature of the crisis facing the country. (Every single question was about coronavirus, by my count.) But the effect of holding it in a near-empty chamber also made a difference because there was no cheering or barracking. Boris Johnson had no noise cushion to help him through. It meant that what he said mattered more.</p> \n  <p>Johnson was pressed repeatedly, especially by Jeremy Corbyn, by Ian Blackford and most effectively of all by Chris Byrant, on what he was doing to help workers who will lose out from coronavirus and he was on slightly shaky ground. Ministers insist they will announce a package of employment support measures very soon, and Johnson repeatedly insisted that people should not lose out for doing the right thing (ie, for staying at home, even if they feel well) and he repeatedly said that he was willing to do whatever it took. To some extent, that still sounded more like a slogan than a strategy.</p> \n  <p>But PMQs should also been an opportunity for the prime minister to listen, as well as to communicate, and one would imagine than Johnson would have left the chamber more persuaded than ever about the need for some mass government intervention to protect workers. If Felicity Buchan, a Kensington Tory with a background in banking, is saying that the government does not need to worry about borrowing any more (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/18/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-pmqs-cbi-urges-government-pay-businesses-directly-saying-350bn-loangrant-package-not-enough?page=with:block-5e7213bc8f085e564ad865ee#block-5e7213bc8f085e564ad865ee\">12.29pm</a>), then it is hard to see what is restraining No 10.</p> \n  <p>Johnson has a proper announcement to make during the session. In response to a question from Corbyn, he confirmed that the government would legislate to protect renters from eviction during the coronavirus crisis. He told MPs:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I can indeed confirm that we will be bringing forward legislation to protect private renters from eviction, that is one thing we will do, but it is also important as we legislate that we do not simply pass on the problem, so we\u2019ll also be taking steps to protect other actors in the economy.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Johnson also announced that coronavirus testing was being ramped up to 25,000 tests a day. And, although he did not reveal what the government\u2019s employment support measures would involve, his answers on this were intriguing. He did not dismiss out of hand the temporary universal basis income idea floated by Blackford, or Bryant\u2019s call for a handout in the form of a summer version of the winter fuel payment.</p> \n  <p>Johnson was also interesting on the subject of schools. He told MPs:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The house should expect further decisions to be taken imminently on schools and how to make sure we square the circle both of making sure we stop the spread of the disease but also making sure we relieve, as much as we can, pressure on our NHS.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>That sounded very much like a hint that the government will announce a partial closure of schools, with some provision being kept open - perhaps for children of key workers, or perhaps with schools in childminding rather than education mode? - to minimise the impact on the NHS.</p> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/18/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-pmqs-cbi-urges-government-pay-businesses-directly-saying-350bn-loangrant-package-not-enough\">Keep with more detailed live news from the UK here</a>.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/18/uk-coronavirus-live-boris-johnson-pmqs-cbi-urges-government-pay-businesses-directly-saying-350bn-loangrant-package-not-enough\">UK coronavirus live: schools in Scotland and Wales to close from Friday</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7224508f085c6327bc2477\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/ashifa-kassam\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-18T13:41:47.338Z\">1.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Spanish hotels set to close as British tourists told to return home</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>British tourists in Spain who are looking to return to the UK should make travel arrangements as soon as possible, the British ambassador to Spain has said, as all hotels in the country have been ordered to close down within a week, writes my colleague Ashifa Kassam in Madrid. </p> \n  <p>\u201cOur advice is now that British tourists in Spain who wish to return home should make travel plans to do so as soon as possible,\u201d Hugh Elliott <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HughElliottUK/status/1240044921207304193\">said in a video posted online on Tuesday evening.</a> </p> \n  <p>He continued: \u201cThe government has ordered the closure of hotels over the next seven days in order to reduce risks to health.\u201d As hotels begin shuttering, some tourists will be asked to move hotels, he noted.</p> \n  <p>The embassy is in close contact with Spanish authorities, who have made it clear that \u201cno one will be left without accommodation,\u201d said Elliott.

Just like in the old days with measles. The larger the group that is immune, the less chance that the virus will jump to vulnerable elderly people and people with poor health. With group immunity you build, as it were, a protective wall around them,\u201d said Rutte.</p> \n  <p>The debate by members of the Dutch House of Representatives can be <a href=\"https://nos.nl/livestream/2327490-kijk-mee-kamerdebat-over-ontwikkelingen-coronavirus.html\">viewed live here</a> on the Netherlands public broadcaster, NOS.</p> \n  <p>But while Rutte insisted on Tuesday that the strategy of his country - which has banned public gatherings and taken other measures - differed little from that of other states some Dutch people have been left to wonder if had become \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheDutchmen4/status/1239674291798585360?s=20\">the guineapigs of Europe</a>.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The British government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/uk-to-ban-mass-gatherings-in-coronavirus-u-turn\">announced last week</a> that it would be banning mass gatherings after prime minister Boris Johnson\u2019s cautious approach to the coronavirus outbreak was overtaken by care homes, sporting bodies and others. That came after the UK government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, had last week defended its initial approach to coronavirus, saying it was aimed at creating a \u201cherd immunity.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Amid a continued debate in the Netherlands, some insisted that the strategy of \u2018herd immunity\u2019 was a side effect rather than the main goal, which was to mirror that of other states in attempting to use social distancing and other measures to \u2018flatten the curve\u2019 of the likely peak of the outbreak.</p> \n  <p>A Dutch microbiologist, Marc Bonten of UMC Utrecht,<a href=\"https://www.telegraaf.nl/nieuws/601067410/virologen-vertrouwen-in-nederlandse-aanpak-maar-nog-veel-onzeker\"> told De Telegraaf newspaper </a>that even countries opting for a total lockdown would have to work on building group immunity.</p> \n  <p>But critics including the London-based economist Jerome Roos pointed to what they estimated the resulting death rate would be, as well as arguing that countries going for \u2018herd immunity\u2019 would <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JeromeRoos/status/1239628249367445506?s=20\">make it impossible for the countries</a> trying

The decision stalls years of careful planning to get people to respond to the survey.</p> \n  <p>The Bureau still has plans to send out field workers in May to follow up with people who fail to self-respond, a critical effort that aims to ensure hard-to-count groups get counted. The Bureau said Wednesday it would adjust that operation as necessary to follow the guidance of public health authorities.</p> \n  <p>The decision, made to mitigate the spread of coronavirus, came about a week after Americans began filling out the survey. The results of the census have profound political consequences -- the data is used to allocate $1.5 trillion in federal funding and to draw electoral districts in place for the next decade. The decennial census is mandated by the constitution.</p> \n  <p>Coronavirus concerns add to a pile of challenges facing the bureau. There is considerable concern that minorities and immigrant groups will be fearful of responding to the survey because of the <strong>Trump administration</strong>\u2019s anti-immigrant rhetoric and policies. Individual census responses must be kept confidential by law. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-18T17:58:48.168Z\">at 5.58pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e725d988f088d7575595e9c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-18T17:52:12.774Z\">5.52pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>The Detroit Three -- Ford, GM and Fiat Chrysler -- have agreed to temporarily close all US plants</strong> to protect workers against coronavirus.</p> \n  <p>The Detroit Free Press <a href=\"https://www.freep.com/story/news/2020/03/18/ford-gm-fca-plant-closures-coronavirus/2865289001/\">reports</a>:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p> Ford Motor Co. said after Thursday evening shifts, Ford is temporarily suspending production at its North America plants through March 30 to thoroughly clean its facilities to protect its workforce and boost containment efforts for the COVID-19 coronavirus.<br></p> \n   <p>Ford said it will continue to work closely with union leaders to find ways to help keep workers healthy and safe, \u2018even as we look at solutions for continuing to provide the vehicles customers really want and need,\u2019 said Kumar Galhotra, Ford\u2019s president of North America. \u2018In these unprecedented times, we\u2019re exploring unique and creative solutions to support our workforce, customers, dealers, suppliers and communities.\u2019</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Union leaders had pushed for the shutdown for the sake of workers\u2019 health, but the move does make it more likely that auto giants will later seek financial assistance to recover from the coronavirus crisis.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e725b9f8f085e564ad869df\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-18T17:36:23.279Z\">5.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Dow has now dropped below where it was on the day of <strong>Trump</strong>\u2019s inauguration in 2017.</p> \n  <p>Therefore, all of the stock market gains that Trump has repeatedly boasted about have now been wiped out.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheStalwart/status/1240315639853703170\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">*DOW INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE WIPES OUT GAINS SINCE TRUMP INAUGURATION<a href=\"https://t.co/ryuOmteNca\">https://t.co/ryuOmteNca</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/DtiBIaGX4y\">pic.twitter.com/DtiBIaGX4y</a></p>\u2014 Joe Weisenthal (@TheStalwart) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheStalwart/status/1240315639853703170?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 18, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7256a28f088d7575595e31\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-18T17:30:30.895Z\">5.30pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Trading halted again amid steep losses</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>This is Joan Greve in Washington, taking over for Adam Gabbatt.</p> \n  <p>Trading was temporarily halted at the New York Stock Exchange, with the Dow currently down more than 1,800 points.</p> \n  <p>This marks the fourth time in two weeks that trading has been halted because of steep losses linked to investors\u2019 fears about the coronavirus crisis.</p> \n  <p>For the latest updates on the market drop, follow the Guardian\u2019s business live blog:</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/mar/18/markets-government-stimulus-pledges-ftse-dow-recession-business-live\">Markets slide and pound hits 1985 lows as Covid-19 crisis deepens - business live</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7252558f085c6327bc2705\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-18T17:10:46.441Z\">5.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Summary</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>\u2022The government has closed the US-Canada border to \u201cnon-essential traffic\u201d, Donald Trump announced</strong>, as the number of coronavirus cases continued to rise.

Matthew Lee, diplomatic writer at Associated Press, has been looking at how coronavirus became the latest flashpoint between the two nations:</p> \n  <p>Since the virus has spread, he reports, Trump and his top aides have stepped up their criticism of China, noting consistently that the outbreak was first reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan. They have referred to Covid-19 as the \u201cWuhan virus\u201d or the \u201cChinese virus\u201d on multiple occasions, disregarding World Health Organization terminology that avoids identifying the virus by geography.</p> \n  <p>On Tuesday alone, Trump discussed the Chinese source of virus outbreak during at least two events. At a State Department news conference, Mike Pompeo referred six times to Covid-19 as the \u201cWuhan virus\u201d, and suggested the Chinese are attempting to distract the world from the shortcomings of its initial response.<br></p> \n  <p>In a meeting with hotel executives at the White House, Trump took pains to make clear that the virus originated in China, asking pointed questions of Marriott CEO Arne Sorenson about where the impact was first felt.</p> \n  <p>\u201cAnd this all started in China? That\u2019s where you first saw the problem and where you first got hit?\u201d Trump asked.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Sorenson replied.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cHopefully, you all heard that,\u201d Trump told reporters.</p> \n  <p>Having already been targeted by Trump in a trade war and by Pompeo and others for repression of Muslim and other religious and ethnic minorities in western Xinjiang Province, the Chinese have taken particular offence to the constant repetition, complaining vociferously and suggesting that the US military may have actually introduced the virus to Wuhan.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cRecently, some American politicians have linked the new coronavirus with China to stigmatize China. We express strong indignation and opposition to it,\u201d foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Tuesday. \u201cWe urge the US to immediately correct its mistakes and stop unwarranted accusations against China.\u201d</p> \n  <p>That, in turn, has prompted angry US protests with the State Department hauling in China\u2019s ambassador to the United States to complain and Pompeo calling the top Chinese diplomat to re-register the anger.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe disinformation campaign that they are waging is designed to shift responsibility,\u201d Pompeo said, before quickly adding that \u201cnow is not the time for recriminations.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Yet recriminations seem to be the order of the day.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cChina was putting out information which was false that our military gave this to them,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThat was false. And rather than having an argument I said I have to call it where it came from. It did come from China. So I think it\u2019s a very accurate term. But no, I didn\u2019t appreciate the fact that China was saying that our military gave it to them.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>Shortly after Trump\u2019s comments, the Chinese foreign ministry announced the expulsion of American reporters from the New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Washington Post. </p> \n  <p>Pompeo responded to that news: \u201cI regret China\u2019s decision today to further foreclose the world\u2019s ability to conduct free press operations that frankly, would be really good, really good for the Chinese people in these incredibly challenging global times. Where more information, more transparency are what will save lives. This is unfortunate,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope they will reconsider.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e71fec88f085c6327bc227b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-18T11:00:39.616Z\">11.00am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Another thing we can expect today is further fall-out from the Chinese decision yesterday to expel American journalists. </p> \n  <p>Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Beijing had been \u201ccompelled\u201d to take countermeasures after Washington imposed restrictions on staff at Chinese state media outlets in the US.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe urge the US to take off its ideological prejudice, abandon cold war mentality,\u201d Geng said. \u201cChina is not one to start trouble, but it will not blink if trouble comes. We urge the US side to immediately stop suppressing Chinese media, otherwise the US side will lose even more.\u201d</p> \n  <p>At least 13 journalists will be expelled in what is an unprecedented retaliation against foreign media working in the country. An announcement made just after midnight said all US journalists working for the New York Times, Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal whose credentials were up for renewal this year would have 10 days to turn in their press cards, a measure that effectively bans them from reporting in the country.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/mar/18/us-media-accuse-china-of-cold-war-mentality-after-move-to-expel-journalists\">China: expulsion of US journalists was response to 'unreasonable oppression'</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e71f4678f085c6327bc2200\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-18T10:49:11.058Z\">10.49am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Good morning. Last night <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/17/2020-four-states-primaries-coronavirus-election\">Joe Biden swept to victory in three primaries</a> held in unprecedented circumstances. Biden <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2020/mar/18/democratic-primary-delegate-count-latest\">has now racked up 1,147 pledged delegates to Bernie Sanders\u2019 861</a> - a lead of 286 that surely looks to be insurmountable. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/17/joe-biden-bernie-sanders-us-elections-2020-panel\">Is it time for Bernie to quit the race</a> in the interest of unifying the party during a national emergency?</p> \n  <p>Ohio cancelled its primary planned for yesterday due to the coronavirus. But with Florida, Illinois and Arizona running their primaries yesterday, predictably <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/17/us-elections-voters-coronavirus\">voters faced confusion, a shortage of poll workers, and shifting or closed polling stations</a>. It\u2019s clear that the way the rest of the campaign is going to be deeply affected by the coronavirus outbreak. The DNC is already urging a shift to vote-by-mail.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheDemocrats/status/1240060828243632128\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">In order to ensure voters can safely make their voices heard, we at the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DNC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@DNC</a> are urging the remaining primary states to make voting easier and safer for both voters and election officials. The simplest way to ensure this is to make vote by mail available to all registered voters.</p>\u2014 The Democrats (@TheDemocrats) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheDemocrats/status/1240060828243632128?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 17, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>With bars, shops, and restaurants ordered shut across parts of the nation, it is impossible to see politics being business-as-usual for some time to come.</p> \n  <p>Yesterday Donald Trump was proclaiming that he knew it was a pandemic all along - just weeks after the president promised that the 15 cases of coronavirus in the US would soon go down to zero. There\u2019s currently - as recorded by the <a href=\"https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\">Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering</a> -<strong> 6,496 confirmed coronavirus cases in the US, and the death toll has now exceeded 100. </strong></p> \n  <p>It is understandably dominating today\u2019s White House agenda. Trump has calls and meetings with the aerospace industry, physicians, nurses, and a quarterly business roundtable. The Coronavirus Task Force will be doing a morning briefing.</p> \n  <p>We\u2019ll be tracking the responses to Biden\u2019s win last night and political developments around the country here.
