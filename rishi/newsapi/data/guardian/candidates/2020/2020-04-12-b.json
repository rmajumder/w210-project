The Associated Press reports:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Long before there was a global coronavirus pandemic, brick-and-mortar retailers struggled to get people to walk through their doors instead of shopping online.</p> <p>Now those retailers are faced with an even more Herculean task: how to stay on people\u2019s minds and more importantly their pocketbooks when many of their store doors are closed.</p> <p>More than 250,000 stores like Macy\u2019s, Nordstrom and Nike that sell non-essential merchandise have temporarily shuttered since mid-March in response to the pandemic. Thats 60% of overall U.S. retail square footage, according to Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail.</p> <p>\u201cRetail has hung a closed sign on the door literally and metaphorically,\u201d Saunders said. \u201cThis is the most catastrophic crisis that retail has faced worse than the financial crisis in 2008, worse than 9/11. Almost overnight, the retail economy shifted from being about things people want to things that they need.\u201d</p> <p>Some retailers have responded to the challenge by coming up with creative ways to stay relevant. Nike, for instance, introduced workout apps in China when the coronavirus first surfaced there, resulting in an 80% increase in users within the quarter and a 30% increase in online sales. It\u2019s now pushing a similar campaign in the U.S. and Europe.</p> <p>Yoga pants maker Lululemon is holding online classes in North America and Europe after gaining thousands of new followers in China on WeChat. Lululemon CEO Calvin McDonald told analysts during a recent call that during its first week of closures in the U.S., it saw nearly 170,000 customers join Lululemon for its live classes.</p> <p>Small businesses are also pivoting in order to hold onto customers. Camp, a new toy chain that set itself apart from online retailers by doubling down on the physical experience, is hosting virtual birthday parties and creating curated gift boxes now that its five stores have gone dark. Politics &amp; Prose, a popular Washington D.C. bookstore, was also forced to temporarily close and is now starting to stream author talks online and offering a curbside pickup service.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e9395128f082dfd549d5368\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-12T22:31:48.406Z\">11.31pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, has outlined his plan to safely reopen the United States in an op-ed <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/12/opinion/joe-biden-coronavirus-reopen-america.html\">published in today\u2019s New York Times</a>. </p> <p>His three steps include: 1) getting the number of new cases down significantly through continued social distancing and improved supply lines to our hospitals with a more thorough deployment of the Defense Production Act; 2) the establishment of widespread, easily available and prompt testing with contact tracing strategy that protects privacy; and 3) increasing the capacity of our healthcare system to protect against the potential flare-up of cases when economic activity reopens.<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>\u201cFor more Americans to go back to their jobs, the president needs to do better at his job,\u201d Biden wrote. </p> <p>As if Trump, the great counterpuncher, was going to take that lying down.

coronavirus tsar Peter Navarro, about whom Julian Borger, our world affairs editor, wrote <a

southern hemisphere experiences in the virus might teach us about the seasonality or otherwise of Covid-19, Dr Nabarro offered a disturbing thought: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We think <strong>it is going to be a virus that stalks the human race for quite a long time</strong> to come until we can all have a vaccine that will protect us and that there will be small outbreaks that will emerge sporadically and they will break through our defenses.</p> </blockquote> <p>Nabarro was also asked about Donald Trump\u2019s criticism of the WHO and his threat this week \u2013 how serious he was was, as ever, unclear \u2013 to withdraw US funding for the international healthcare body:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The World Health Organization actually works on behalf of all the governments in the world. And it operates within mandates that are given to it. And, and we have to rely on information that\u2019s received from different governments. And that then permits us to work out what\u2019s going on \u2026 but <strong>we know that there will be many things that are found to have perhaps not been done as well as they could have been done</strong>. And we\u2019re anticipating there\u2019ll be lots of examinations afterwards. </p> <p>Right now, we have to move forward. We have to get the best possible cooperation. I just heard you discussing with the head of the FDA some of the challenges, the things that we\u2019re learning about this virus all the time. That\u2019s why we need a strong WHO, a trusted WHO. And we hope all leaders will continue to work with us in that way.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Meet the Press Chuck Todd asked</strong> that given <strong>\u201c</strong>the United States is anywhere \u2013 approximately 15% to 20% of your annual budget \u2026 how devastating would it be if the United States pulled its funding?\u201d</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, you know, <strong>we\u2019re right in the middle of this massive epic struggle. Every single human being in the world is affected by it</strong>. Businesses are really in trouble. Communities are in distress. I really do hope that all nations will not find any reason to make threats or other such things that will undermine our capacity to bring together all the best knowledge that we can find. </p> <p>\u201cAnd of course we love our partnership with the United States. We work with United States scientists for years \u2026 and <strong>that would be so unfortunate if anything happened to lessen that cooperation</strong>. </p> <p>\u201cI know that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/tedros-adhanom\"><strong>Tedros [Adhanom Ghebreyesus], the director general</strong></a>, has had direct discussions with the president of the US.

Last week, the Trump announced he would establish a bipartisan \u201cOpening Our Country Council\u201d to weigh in on issue.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of very smart people, a lot of professionals, doctors and business leaders are a lot of things that go into a decision like that,\u201d he told Pirro. \u201cAnd it\u2019s going to be based on a lot of facts and a lot of instinct also. Whether we like it or not, there is a certain instinct to it.</p> <p>The council, Trump added, would include \u201csome of the most distinguished leaders in virtually every field, including politics and business and medical. And we\u2019ll be making that decision fairly soon.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s phone-in came ahead of an early morning tweet on Sunday in which he attacked <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/11/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-response.html\"><strong>a New York Times report</strong></a> which said the White House failed to act on several explicit security agency warnings in January about the potential for coronavirus to spread to the US.</p> <p>\u201cSo now the Fake News is tracing the CoronaVirus origins back to Europe, NOT China. This is a first! I wonder what the Failing New York Times got for this one? Are there any NAMED sources? They were recently thrown out of China like dogs, and obviously want back in. Sad!\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s interpretation of the report appeared to misconstrue scientific evidence that the spread of coronavirus to the Eastern US came through Europe \u2013 but not that it originated there.</p> <p>The claim comes despite evidence that trade adviser Peter Navarro warned Trump in 29 January <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/us/politics/navarro-warning-trump-coronavirus.html\">memo</a> that as many as 500,000 Americans could die if the virus was allowed to spread across the US unchecked. A day later, health and human services secretary Alex Azar issued a similar warning. The White House did not issue national social distancing guidelines until 16 March. </p> <p>On Saturday, Trump vowed to rebuild the US economy, which has suffered trillions of dollars in damage from the outbreak, as a tribute to those who have died. Trump predicted that the economy to rebound like a \u201crocket ship\u201d because Americans have combated the coronavirus the \u201cright way\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe did it the right way. We took care of social distancing and all of the things, words that nobody ever heard before, frankly, and phrases. But if we didn\u2019t do that, we would have pulled through it,\u201d Trump said. </p> <p>\u201cThere were estimates, 2.2 million people.

He has targeted 1 May as the date when the country may begin a return to normalcy, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1249341768157495296\">in a tweet on Sunday morning</a> cited a drop in hospitalisations as \u201ca very good sign\u201d.</p> <p>But Dr Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s leading infectious diseases expert, stressed any such move should come only when it was safe and as a gradual process.

And everybody knows that.</p> <p>\u201cWhen one starts to relax some of those restrictions, we know that there will be people who will be getting infected. That is just reality. The critical issue is to be able to, in real time, identify, isolate and contact trace.</p> <p>\u201cObviously, New York, [which] is going through a terrible ordeal, is going to be very different from Arkansas, and very different maybe from some places on the west coast, like Washington state, which have been successfully able to prevent that big spike.

That has to come first,\u201d Hahn told NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, noting he had not felt political pressure on any decision. \u201cTesting is one component of the response to the outbreak, in addition to the mitigation effort \u2026 so all hands on deck to try to get more diagnostic tests in.\u201d</p> <p>WHO special envoy Dr David Nabarro made a grim prediction.</p> <p>\u201cWe think it is going to be a virus that stalks the human race for quite a long time to come until we can all have a vaccine that will protect us and that there will be small outbreaks that will emerge sporadically and they will break through our defences,\u201d he said, also on NBC.</p> <p>Trump has been <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-who.html\">highly critical of the WHO</a>, in comments some have seen as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/world-health-organization-coronavirus-donald-trump\">scapegoating</a> to deflect from the failures of his own administration.</p> <p>\u201cThe WHO works on behalf of all the governments in the world and it operates within mandates that are given to it,\u201d Nabarro said. \u201cWe know there will be many things found to have perhaps not been done as well as they could have been, and we\u2019re anticipating there\u2019ll be lots of examinations afterwards. Right now, we have to move forward.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s Sunday tweet appeared to indicate he was still keen to reopen the country sooner than later, having told Fox News on Saturday night he would seek advice from \u201cvery smart people\u201d.

  "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s abrupt ousting of two veteran watchdogs has prompted fears the scandal-prone US president is purging people from government who have oversight of fraud, waste and abuse.</p> <p>The moves also come at a time when a global pandemic and resulting mass <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/09/us-unemployment-filings-coronavirus\">unemployment crisis</a> has prompted a multitrillion-dollar economic rescue effort, much of which is aimed at helping some of America\u2019s largest companies.</p> <p>Ex-watchdogs \u2013 dubbed inspectors general \u2013 plus top Democrats have voiced alarm at Trump\u2019s removal last week of an acting IG at the Pentagon slated to lead a new oversight panel for the $2.2tn <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/27/washington-coronavirus-stimulus-bill-vote\">coronavirus relief law</a>. The move came just days after Trump axed the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/04/donald-trump-fires-intelligence-watchdog-michael-atkinson-impeachment\">intelligence community IG</a> who had alerted Congress to a whistleblower complaint precipitating Trump\u2019s impeachment.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/06/ousted-us-intelligence-inspector-general-urges-others-to-speak-out-and-defend-whistleblowers\">Ousted US intelligence inspector general urges whistleblowers not to be 'silenced' by Trump</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trump also drew fire for tapping a White House lawyer involved in fighting impeachment as a special IG to oversee a $500bn corporate bailout piece of the $2.2tn law. Days before, Trump had used the signing statement for the law to blunt two newly created IG posts, suggesting he would decide what information Congress receives about the aid package.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s sudden oustings of the two well-respected watchdogs, Michael Atkinson, the IG for the intelligence community, and Glenn Fine, the acting IG for the Pentagon, sparked special concerns given their timing and apparent political motivations.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s ousting of Fine, who was recently picked by his fellow IGs to run a critical oversight panel for the $2.2tn law, is seen as a broad slap at any oversight on the president and his administration since it rendered Fine ineligible to lead the watchdog panel.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s motives in firing Atkinson prompted other worries. After initially saying he had simply lost confidence in Atkinson, Trump used a pandemic press briefing the next day to unleash an angry torrent at Atkinson\u2019s handling of the whistleblower complaint, slamming him as not \u201ca big Trump fan\u201d.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s antipathy to IG watchdogs was displayed again at a pandemic briefing last week when he was asked about a report by the health and human services IG revealing that hospitals faced \u201cwidespread\u201d shortages of face masks, and \u201csevere\u201d test shortages.</p> <p>Providing no evidence, Trump dismissed the report as \u201cjust wrong\u201d, and the next day labeled it \u201canother fake dossier\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"06b7f8acf731ab75671a37e1764ec48afa299e3e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06b7f8acf731ab75671a37e1764ec48afa299e3e/0_126_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"At a recent press briefing Trump unleashed an angry torrent at Atkinson\u2019s handling of the whistleblower complaint.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">At a recent press briefing Trump unleashed an angry torrent at Atkinson\u2019s handling of the whistleblower complaint.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Wong/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>IGs were created in 1978 to ferret out executive agency waste, fraud and abuse.

Trump doesn\u2019t understand any legal mandate that conflicts with personal loyalty.

Horowitz has also vowed that \u201caggressive, independent oversight\u201d would continue after the firing.</p> <p>Former officials say Trump mistreated Atkinson.</p> <p>\u201cIt is troubling to see that the president \u2013 apparently based on political grievances \u2013 has removed Michael Atkinson, a talented and capable inspector general who was doing exactly what his job requires,\u201d said Mary McCord, a former chief of the DoJ\u2019s national security section where Atkinson once worked.</p> <p>Atkinson himself concurred.</p> <p>\u201cIt is hard not to think that the president\u2019s loss of confidence in me derives from my having faithfully discharged my legal obligations as an independent and impartial Inspector General, and from my commitment to continue to do so,\u201d Atkinson said in a statement on Sunday.</p> <p>Other criticism of Trump erupted when he selected the White House lawyer Brian Miller as a special IG for a $500bn business chunk of the $2.2tn law.</p> <p>\u201cSomeone who currently works in the White House counsel\u2019s office, serving a president who has tried to silence other inspector generals and announced his intention to silence this one, is not independent,\u201d Senator Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate finance panel, said in a statement.</p> <p>In Bromwich\u2019s eyes, Trump \u201chas rejected all forms of oversight by congressional committees, and has now turned his opposition to oversight to the IG community\u201d.</p>",
  "<p>Gavin Newsom this week declared himself the leader of a \u201cnation-state\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MaddowBlog/status/1247698364063518720\">Speaking on MSNBC</a>, the California governor on Tuesday announced his state would be amassing more than 200m medical-grade masks per month for health workers on the frontlines of the coronavirus pandemic. After weeks of competing with other states for critical medical equipment, in the absence of strategy and coordination from the federal government, Newsom said he had had enough. So he harnessed the bulk purchasing power of \u201cthe state of California as a nation-state\u201d to spend nearly $1bn to work with non-profits and manufacturers to deliver masks for his constituents, and possibly other states.</p> <p>The next morning, as <a href=\"https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article241860561.html\">#PresidentNewsom trended</a> on Twitter, Newsom once again presented the state he leads as a global power. \u201cWe need to coordinate and organize our nation-state status,\u201d he told reporters at his daily Covid-19 press briefing. California \u201chas been a catalyst to increase supply that will not only avail itself to the state of California but more broadly across this country and potentially in other parts of the globe\u201d, he added.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/04/why-california-waiting-test-results-backlog-quest-diagnostics\">Why is California still waiting for nearly 60,000 coronavirus test results?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As the leader of the nation\u2019s most populous state \u2013 which, Newsom often likes to point out, would have the world\u2019s fifth-largest economy, if it were a sovereign nation \u2013 the governor has often cast himself as a foil to Donald Trump. As the president and the governor bickered, critics in California have lamented that the governor often promised more than he could deliver, and was at times counterproductive by trying to appease too many groups at once. But amid the federal government\u2019s faltering response to the coronavirus crisis, Newsom is getting both local and national recognition for stepping into a leadership vacuum.</p> <p>After identifying its first cases of Covid-19 in late February, California became the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/13/california-coronavirus-response-schools-disneyland\">first US state to issue</a> a widespread stay-at-home order on 19 March. Since then, the state has seen more than 20,000 coronavirus cases and 570 deaths \u2013 but the death toll appears to be rising more slowly than in hard-hit New York and New Jersey. Public health experts have credited the <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-31/coronavirus-social-distancing-west-coast-california-new-york-covid\">state\u2019s foresight</a> in enforcing social distancing. The Trump administration\u2019s response meanwhile, has lagged behind, with the president denying the crisis and delaying action even as the national death toll climbed.</p> <p>Newsom moved into the governor\u2019s mansion in 2018, replacing Jerry Brown \u2013 a prominent figure who had dominated California politics since the 1970s. At 52, he has already had a long career in politics and weathered a fair share of scandal. More than 15 years ago, as San Francisco mayor, he made headlines after he defied national law to marry same-sex couples in California. He made national headlines again in 2007 after it was revealed he had an <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/02/us/02newsom.html\">affair with a subordinate</a>, who was also the wife of his chief campaign adviser. At the time, Newsom was separated from Kimberly Guilfoyle \u2013 now an adviser to the president, and the partner of his son Donald Trump Jr.</p> <p>Newsom has tried to cast himself as a young, fresh and progressive leader \u2013 whose Silicon Valley-chic contrasts with Brown\u2019s suits and ties. He has also presented himself as the governor of \u201cthe most un-Trump state in America\u201d \u2013 loudly challenging the Trump administration\u2019s policies on the environment, immigration, healthcare and gun rights \u2013 often on the president\u2019s favorite platform: Twitter. Trump, meanwhile, has relished taunting Newsom as an \u201cincompetent governor\u201d, and obsessing over narrow policies that disproportionately affect California.</p> <p>But amid the coronavirus crisis, rather than fighting the president, Newsom has opted to show him up, in some cases delivering on the president\u2019s empty promises. As Trump <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/politics/100000007026448/trump-coronavirus.html\">blithely reassured</a>, \u201cJust stay calm. It will go away,\u201d Newsom earned praise from public health experts around the country for enforcing strict, early distancing orders. While Trump beat back pleas from governors to send more of the ventilators needed to treat coronavirus patients, Newsom shipped <a href=\"https://calmatters.org/newsletter/ca-feds-500-ventilators-national-stockpile-new-york/\">500 ventilators</a> to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GavinNewsom/status/1247655661120315393\">seven states</a>. And when the federal government sent <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-03-29/california-broken-ventilators-silicon-valley-newsom\">faulty equipment</a>, Newsom harnessed the state\u2019s outsized tech industry to quickly fix them.</p> <p>As the federal government stepped back from the crisis, governors including Newsom, Andrew Cuomo in New York and Jay Inslee in Washington found a national audience of Americans looking for steady administration amid chaos.</p> <p>Governors across the country have stepped up, said Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic political strategist who has worked for former president Bill Clinton and former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--inline\"> <blockquote> <p>People look for heroes in times of crisis.

Newsom made \u201ca big statement\u201d when he made California the first US state to order all residents to stay home, Renteria told the Guardian. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be an after-review of how those actions made a difference,\u201d she noted.</p> <p>Already, public health officials are praising Newsom\u2019s early action. Dr Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, has repeatedly held up California as a success story to highlight the effectiveness of distancing measures to \u201cflatten the curve\u201d. Even Donald Trump, who has singled out other Democratic governors as targets during his daily coronavirus briefings, has lauded Newsom. \u201cGavin Newsom has been terrific,\u201d the president <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-13/\">said at a 28 March</a><a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-13/\"> briefing</a>. A few days later, Trump again admitted, \u201cThey\u2019ve done a good job, California.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou cannot help but be impressed by his response,\u201d said Bill Whalen, a media consultant for California politicians including the ex-governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, \u201cI\u2019m not by nature a great fan of his agenda.\u201d</p> <p>Newsom\u2019s political career going forward will hinge on how well he\u2019s able to sustain the momentum, as Californians continue to weather the pandemic. Already, the same criticisms of his lack of focus and boundless ambition are starting to catch up to him.</p> <p>His dramatic announcement on national television that he had secured hundreds of millions of medical masks, left many <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-04-09/gavin-newsom-coronavirus-masks-purchase-california-legislature\">state lawmakers confused</a>, without clarity on the total amount being spent, and without having seen the details of the contracts signed by the administration. And some of the groups that Newsom had apparently included in his deal were blindsided by his announcement.</p> <p>\u201cThe governor has apparently done something extraordinary by making arrangements we were not privy to,\u201d Thomas Tighe, CEO of the California-based not-for-profit Direct Relief, told <a href=\"https://calmatters.org/newsletter/newsom-trump-cuomo-masks-ventilators-supply/\">Calmatters</a>. \u201cBut we\u2019re delighted.\u201d</p> <p>And while California has not seen the surge in coronavirus cases that have overwhelmed cities like New York and Detroit in the past weeks, Newsom has admitted that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/01/california-coronavirus-shelter-in-place-flatten-curve\">delays and huge backlo</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/01/california-coronavirus-shelter-in-place-flatten-curve\">gs</a> in coronavirus testing have left Californians with an unclear image of how, exactly, the disease is spreading through the state. The governor said he \u201cowns\u201d the issues with testing, and has developed a taskforce to correct course.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s rare that elected leaders get real-time feedback on how well they led,\u201d Renteria noted. \u201cBut now people are getting to know their leaders, and paying attention to what they do in that moment of truth.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 15 April 2020 because California issued a stay-at-home order on 19 March, not on 10 March as an earlier version said.

But, thanks to the ongoing pandemic, it was a messy, borderline dystopian experiment affair.</p> <p>Wisconsin forged ahead with its election in defiance of grave warnings from public health officials and more than a dozen other states that chose to postpone their primary over fears for voters\u2019 health.</p> <p>So on Tuesday, thousands of voters waited in hours-long lines to cast ballots wearing protective face masks while poll workers relied on hand sanitizer and, in some cases, makeshift hazmat suits.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"71d4a482eb951572a73c3fc6f40cebe9198e5bbf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/71d4a482eb951572a73c3fc6f40cebe9198e5bbf/0_0_2600_1776/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Robert Forrestal, left, wears a full face chemical shield to protect against the spread of coronavirus, as he votes Tuesday, April 7, 2020, at the Janesville Mall in Janesville, Wisconsin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"683\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Robert Forrestal, left, wears a full-face chemical shield to protect against coronavirus, as he votes on 7 April at the Janesville Mall in Janesville, Wisconsin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Angela Major/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dressed like a surgeon in a blue gown, gloves and a mask, the Wisconsin assembly speaker, Robin Vos, a Republican who opposed all efforts to stop in-person voting from taking place, swelled with pride at the scenes of Wisconsin residents fulfilling their civic duty in the midst of a deadly outbreak.</p> <p>\u201cYou are incredibly safe to go out,\u201d he <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/JournalTimes/videos/576705336386460/\">assured constituents</a> with a confidence belied by his ensemble.</p> <h2><strong>The incredible comeback</strong></h2> <p>Joe Biden finished fourth in Iowa, fifth in New Hampshire and a distant second in Nevada. With the weight of presidential history against him, the left-for-dead former vice-president looked to South Carolina for salvation. </p> <p>His fortunes began to change with an endorsement from Congressman Jim Clyburn, the most powerful Democrat in South Carolina and one of only a few political figures in America with the power to move votes with a single blessing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ad62c223e10c235a7b6ac93fb9380ad38cff1ce6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ad62c223e10c235a7b6ac93fb9380ad38cff1ce6/0_0_5409_3635/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden arrives with wife Jill (C) and sister Valerie at a Super Tuesday campaign event at Baldwin Hills Recreation Center on March 3, 2020 in Los Angeles, California.

He swept to victory on Super Tuesday \u2013 going from loser to winner in less than a week.</p> <p>In the end, South Carolina was far more than Biden\u2019s firewall. It was a rocket-fulled jet pack that propelled his string of March victories and set in motion a political revival that longtime political observers swore they had never seen before.</p> <h2><strong>The richest campaign in history</strong></h2> <p>Mike Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, spent nearly a billion dollars \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/bloomberg-spent-nearly-1-billion-his-three-month-presidential-campaign-n1165306\">that\u2019s billion with a B</a> \u2013 on a three-month presidential bid that triggered widespread fears \u2013 and plenty of criticism \u2013 that he might effectively buy the nomination.</p> <p>Bloomberg, <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/billionaires/\">the 16th wealthiest man in the world,</a> spent lavishly across the US, hiring thousands of staff and flooding the airwaves and internet with endless adverts. His approach was unorthodox: skip the early states and run up the score on Super Tuesday.</p> <p>After rising steadily in the polls, Bloomberg won a place on the debate stage \u2013 where Senator Elizabeth Warren so thoroughly savaged his character and his record that she later <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/3/5/21166278/elizabeth-warren-drop-out-mike-bloomberg-chris-matthews\">claimed credit</a> for drawing figurative <a href=\"https://shop.elizabethwarren.com/products/billionaire-tears-mug\">billionaire tears</a><strong> </strong>\u2013 and earned a swath of negative publicity for his policies on minority rights as mayor and treatment of women as a media mogul.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"49db7d895e3cf4c0d7e4d3c1a27ebe5a9a691c76\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/49db7d895e3cf4c0d7e4d3c1a27ebe5a9a691c76/0_0_3000_2000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Democratic presidential candidate former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg speaks during a \u201cUnited for Mike,\u201d event held at the Aventura Turnberry Jewish Center and Tauber Academy Social Hall on January 26, 2020 in Aventura, Florida.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mike Bloomberg speaks during a \u2018United for Mike\u2019 event held on 26 on January in Aventura, Florida.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Raedle/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When the results rolled in on Super Tuesday, Bloomberg\u2019s gargantuan effort yielded the grand prize of American Samoa. The US territory boasts a delegate haul of six, which he split four to two with the Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard. Bloomberg promptly dropped out and endorsed Biden.</p> <p>But the saga of his failed experiment continues. Former campaign staffers are now suing Bloomberg for fraud, alleging that he tricked them and thousands of other employees laid off last month into accepting jobs on the promise that they would be paid until the general election in November.

The political prognosis was grim: his campaign would never recover.</p> <p>Yet the \u201cpolitical establishment\u201d \u2013 and the manifold other interests he rails against \u2013 had once again underestimated the Vermont democratic socialist.</p> <p>In a matter of weeks, the perennial underdog <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/13/bernie-sanders-polling-lead-democrats-campaign\">charted an extraordinary rebound. </a>Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez endorsed him.

Then, in Nevada, his political revolution finally arrived. He won across the board, dominating with Latinos and first-time caucus-goers. For a brief moment, before South Carolina changed everything, Sanders appeared unstoppable, his ascent to the nomination inevitable. </p> <h2><strong>The </strong><strong> collapse of the Iowa caucus</strong></h2> <p>There are few political events in American politics as highly anticipated as the Iowa caucuses.</p> <p>Presidential candidates spend untold resources and time in this state, endowed with outsized powers to set the course of national politics. But this year, the state would not be remembered for choosing the winner of the first presidential nominating contest.</p> <p>Instead it was the site of a disastrous results reporting meltdown.</p> <p>Caucus day arrived and residents gathered at churches, schools and gymnasiums for this quadrennial display of democracy in action. Hours passed without any results. Rumors began to circulate that an app designed to record and relay the tallies of this byzantine process had malfunctioned. By then, the reporting hotline was overwhelmed with callers. As night turned to day, it was clear the caucuses had gone farcically wrong.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"25b9e6d28f322abb5b07a5ce0c2ffd879423ac5b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25b9e6d28f322abb5b07a5ce0c2ffd879423ac5b/0_0_4000_2667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Papers cover the floor near boxes of voter registration forms inside an auxiliary Iowa Democratic Party office in Des Moines, Iowa, U.S., on Tuesday, Feb. 4, 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Papers cover the floor near boxes of voter registration forms inside an Iowa Democratic party office in Des Moines on 4 February.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Acke/Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The party did not officially <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/29/politics/iowa-democratic-caucuses-certified-results/index.html\">certify</a> the results until nearly a month after Iowans cacused. The Associated Press ultimately decided <a href=\"https://apnews.com/fc6777e93b8c50b2fd20e0d31fcc43b3\">not</a> to declare a winner.</p> <p>The screw-up was later attributed to a combination of technical difficulties and human error. But the state may never recover \u2013 with speculation that it may lose its first-in-the-nation voting spot. After rounds of recounting and re-canvassing, riddled by inaccuracies and inconsistencies, the former South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg was declared the delegate winner while Sanders won the popular vote.</p> <p>On the evening of the caucuses, with no data to betray them, a procession of candidates trotted on stage to declare some version of victory before jetting off to New Hampshire with every intention of never looking back.</p> <p>\u201cIowa,\u201d Buttigieg declared, \u201cyou have shocked the nation.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>The candidates</strong></h2> <p>Democrats have never had so many options for president. At its peak, the Democratic squad was large enough to field both sides of an entire soccer game, with subs.</p> <p>There were six women; two black senators; an Asian American entrepreneur promising everyone $1,000 a month; a Latino former housing secretary; a gay small-town mayor who rose from obscurity to political stardom; a Hindu anti-war congresswoman; two billionaires and a self-help guru who vowed to \u201charness love\u201d to defeat Trump.</p> <p>But through it all two white men in their 70s \u2013 a former vice-president and the runner-up in the last Democratic primary \u2013 led the field for much of the race.</p> <p>And, of course, through all those ups and downs, the end result of that enormous field was the one that national polls had predicted from the start: Joe Biden won.</p>",

After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/michaelgove\">Michael Gove</a> appeared to give a doorstep interview while squinting through clouds of steaming urine vapour, I hoped to elaborate further on the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster\u2019s heroic struggle with gasses. But now he is self-isolating, this would seem tasteless. Hopefully the member for Surrey Heath has some medicinal powders stashed away somewhere for his hour of need.</p> <p>Likewise, for nearly a year, I have been referring to the prime minister by an ever-elongating name composed exclusively of lies he has told, crass things he has said and racist remarks he has made. But as I file this piece on Wednesday morning, the PM is in intensive care, so it would be a terrible error of judgment to do so now. Indeed, the PM\u2019s role is delegated instead to the secretary of state, Dominic Dover-Calais Foodbank-Cashflow Feminist-Bigots Childish-Wishlist Lazy-Workers Wage-Scaleback Toss-Denier Britannia-Unchained Duty-of-Candour Break-Up-the-NHS Daily-Superfruitpot <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/dominic-raab\">Raab</a>.</p> <p>In 2018, the former Brexit secretary became the victim of indiscreet revelations concerning <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/apr/26/security-alert-after-housing-ministers-aide-caught-in-sex-website-sting\">his relationship with Pret a Manger</a> snack fruits, but he remains characterised by his harsh views. Everyone knows someone in the health service working 12-hour shifts in corona-infested spaces, ignored by politicians and the press, with only <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/london-paramedics-rationed-to-one-mask-between-two-people\">paper facemasks for protection</a>, threatened with dismissal if they complain. Hopefully, Superfruitpot will continue to support the workers he considers overpaid in the monolithic NHS he wants scaled back, with its childish wishlist of public health-based hopes.</p> <p>On Tuesday night, Superfruitpot said the PM will beat the virus because he is \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/apr/07/dominic-raab-says-boris-johnson-is-a-fighter-who-will-pull-through-in-covid-19-battle-video\">a fighter</a>\u201d, a comment that tells you all you need to know about Superfruitpot and his colleagues\u2019 mindset. Mortality has a morality. Those who die do so because they did not fight to survive. And that is also why, in simpler times, they are queuing at foodbanks, demanding pay and rights and clogging up a potentially perfect world with their inadequacies.

Drunk in the dark on canned M&amp;S slimline gin and tonics, I dreamed last night this Lovecraftian deity was none other than The Market itself, mankind subservient to its demands, an entity that wants to press us back into service of its self-sustaining agenda, irrespective of the human cost.

Trump\u2019s briefings are one-third true, one-third misleading and one-third complete gibberish. Can you ever remember Obama speaking gibberish?\u201d</p> <p>Typically in national emergencies, presidents make contact with their predecessors.

All five living <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/22/all-five-living-former-us-presidents-make-rare-appearance-together\">former presidents came together</a> to raise funds for hurricane relief in 2017 . Trump, however, has made clear he has no intention of speaking to Obama about the virus because \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to learn much\u201d.</p> <p>But he has frequently sought to blame Obama for the leaving the country unprepared, even though it was Trump who disbanded the national security council\u2019s pandemic preparedness unit. And this week, when Senator Bernie Sanders dropped out of the Democratic primary, he speculated on when Obama will endorse Biden.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know why President Obama hasn\u2019t supported Joe Biden a long time ago,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-22/\">Trump told reporters.</a> \u201cThere is something he feels is wrong.

We\u2019re not \u2013 we think a little bit differently.\u201d</p> <p>Few would disagree with that assertion. Trump is not alone in wondering why Obama has not already endorsed Biden. But it is not the first time: in 2015, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/04/bidens-20202-announcement-brought-praise-obama/587989/\">Obama reportedly decided</a> Hillary Clinton should be his successor and helped steer Biden away from running.</p> <p>Sabato said: \u201cIt\u2019s about time, whenever he does it.

So why would he waste that card?\u201d</p> <p>The endorsement would presumably come before the Democratic national convention in Milwaukee, which has been <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/us/politics/milwaukee-democratic-convention-delayed.html\">postponed from July to August</a> because of the virus. If it does go ahead, Obama and his wife, Michelle, would have a crucial role to play in making Biden\u2019s case, especially to many younger voters who flocked to Sanders in the primary.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.davidlittbooks.com/\">David Litt</a>, a former Obama speechwriter and author of the upcoming Democracy in One Book or Less, said: \u201cBarack Obama is a very good person to introduce Joe Biden to younger voters. There\u2019s an old Bill Clinton saying: sometimes you need someone else to brag on you. Obama is the perfect person to brag on Biden. He can speak to Biden\u2019s abilities as a politician and is more trusted than anyone in the country right now.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>In 1985, a young KGB officer arrived in provincial East Germany. His name was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/sep/08/the-observer-view-on-russia-subversion-of-democracy\">Vladimir Putin</a>. What exactly Putin got up to in Dresden is a mystery. The official version says not much: he drank beer, put on weight, lived in an ordinary apartment with his wife, Lyudmila, and their two daughters. While other Soviet spies were having adventures, Putin \u2013 so the story goes \u2013 sat out the late cold war in a paper-shuffling backwater.</p> <p>The investigative journalist and former <em>Financial Times</em> reporter Catherine Belton has dug deeper. Her groundbreaking book, <em>Putin\u2019s People: How the KGB Took Back Russia and then Took on the West</em>, offers a far more terrifying version. Putin was a senior liaison officer with the Stasi, East Germany\u2019s secret police, she suggests. And Dresden was a key base for KGB operations, including murderous ones, in which Putin allegedly played a direct part.</p> <p>During its struggle with capitalism, the Politburo funded radical terrorist groups in the Middle East and elsewhere. It supported the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/28/germany.terrorism\">Red Army Faction</a>, the far left outfit that carried out a series of deadly attacks in the 1970s and 1980s in West Germany. Belton tracks down a former member who recalls how he travelled secretly to East Berlin. From there, he was driven to Dresden for meetings with Comrade Putin and another KGB officer.</p> <p>The KGB gave the West Germans weapons and cash. And it recommended possible targets. One may have been Alfred Herrhausen, the head of Deutsche Bank, who was blown up in 1989 with a sophisticated bomb on his way to work, weeks after the Berlin Wall fell. Moscow\u2019s goal was to disrupt and to \u201csow chaos in the west\u201d, the ex-terrorist tells Belton, a mission Putin would continue energetically from within the Kremlin, as prime minister and president.</p> <p>The story is one of several hair-raising revelations. Belton gives a chilling account of Putin\u2019s rise to power and his personal corruption. Previous books have been written on the same theme, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/apr/20/karen-dawisha-obituary\">Karen Dawisha</a>\u2019s notable <em>Putin\u2019s Kleptocracy</em>. But Belton offers the most detailed and compelling version yet, based on dozens of interviews with oligarchs and Kremlin insiders, as well as former KGB operatives and Swiss and Russian bankers.</p> <p>The KGB made extensive use of slush funds and front companies to fund western communist parties. Belton suggests that Putin employs a similar money-laundering model. In the 1990s, he got a job with St Petersburg\u2019s mayor, Anatoly Sobchak. Putin worked hand in glove with the organised criminals who controlled the city\u2019s port and oil refinery. He took bribes and siphoned cash from oil-for-food schemes, the book alleges.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Similar to his Dresden mission, Putin has expended considerable resources in subverting western democracies</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Once he succeeded Boris Yeltsin, this corrupt model was rolled out nationally. Putin pushed out Yeltsin-era officials, replacing them with KGB friends. The new president had a goal: to restore Russia as an imperial power. Putin and his allies believed that the return of a strong state and their personal fortunes were linked. They saw themselves as \u201canointed custodians\u201d, Belton argues, entitled to grab key sectors of the economy and get rich.</p> <p>In a remarkable chapter, Belton names individuals who allegedly serve as Putin\u2019s financiers. One is <a href=\"https://www.investmenteurope.net/investmenteurope/news/3707488/societe-generale-private-banking-suisse-appoints-goutchkoff-deputy-ceo\">Jean Goutchkov</a>, the grandson of a White Russian aristocrat and an executive formerly with HSBC in Geneva. Another is <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/profiles/gennady-timchenko/\">Gennady</a><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/profiles/gennady-timchenko/\"> Timchenko</a>, an oil trader who allegedly acts as a \u201ccustodian\u201d for Putin\u2019s wealth. (Timchenko denies this.) Goutchkov is part of a well-developed international network that helped Moscow in Soviet times and now fixes for Putin, she writes.</p> <p>Collectively, Putin and his St Petersburg team run the state along criminal clan lines, Belton says. There is a common cash pot known as an <em>obschak</em>. This can be used for personal projects, such as the lavish $1bn palace built for the president by the Black Sea. A whistleblower tells Belton that insiders working on the secret villa referred to Putin using nicknames, which included \u201cMichael Ivanovich\u201d, a police chief from a Soviet comedy, \u201cthe papa\u201d and \u201cthe number one\u201d. At other times, they pointed at the ceiling.</p> <p><em>Putin\u2019s People</em> chronicles the ways in which these same slush funds can be deployed to achieve political ends. They might be domestic: rigging an election, say, or influencing events abroad. Similar to his Dresden mission, Putin has expended considerable resources in subverting western democracies. He has bought off leading politicians and funded divisive far-right parties across Europe. In Belton\u2019s clear-eyed view, Russia uses capitalism as a weapon to \u201cget even\u201d with the hated west.</p> <p>Nowhere is this more evident than in London. The British political and professional class has shown itself to be especially greedy, Belton asserts. Peers have got jobs on the boards of Moscow state corporations, while the London stock exchange has allowed the flotation of these same dodgy firms. (New York, by contrast, has stricter rules.) Kremlin barons have bought up Kensington. Large sums from Russian emigres have flowed into Boris Johnson\u2019s Conservative party, including before the last election.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2d2d2d98b8b51adca8c38e58f66a4fcaa077b656\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d2d2d98b8b51adca8c38e58f66a4fcaa077b656/0_206_4000_2400/1000..jpg\" alt=\"The grave of murdered ex-KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The grave of murdered ex-KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko, Highgate cemetery, London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Belton\u2019s analysis is relentless and convincing. There are gobsmacking moments. According to a former associate of Roman Abramovich, Putin personally directed the tycoon in 2003 to buy Chelsea Football Club (a claim that Abramovich denies). Another source, Sergei Pugachev, a one-time government insider now in oligarch exile, said Putin\u2019s objective was to raise Russia\u2019s profile, with the elite and with ordinary Brits. The acquisition was part of a bigger infiltration of the west by Moscow, via dirty cash. \u201cIt was as if a virus was being injected,\u201d Belton writes.</p> <p>Meanwhile, defining episodes from the Putin era are shown in a new light. In 2002, armed Chechen fighters seized <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/oct/28/chechnya.russia6\">Moscow\u2019s Dubrovka theatre</a>, taking nearly 900 people hostage. It was Igor Sechin, Putin\u2019s gatekeeper and lieutenant, who made the fateful decision to use lethal chemical gas to stun the terrorists, one insider reveals. At least 115 hostages died. Sechin also reportedly instructed a judge what sentence to give Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the oligarch jailed in 2005 for fraud.</p> <p>This is a superb book. Its only flaw is a heavy reliance on well-placed anonymous sources. Talking publicly about Kremlin corruption is dangerous, as the polonium fate of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/19/alexander-litvinenko-the-man-who-solved-his-own-murder\">Alexander Litvinenko</a> shows. Still, the lack of names can be frustrating. Belton writes of a Russian who \u201cslipped through the cracks\u201d to become \u201cclose friends with Johnson\u201d when the future prime minister was London\u2019s mayor. Alas, she doesn\u2019t identify him.</p> <p>There are admirable on-the-record interviews with major players from Putin\u2019s court, including KGB officer turned railways minister Vladimir Yakunin. Yakunin and other secret service figures rejoice at the way the world is going: Brexit, Donald Trump, and the decline of the liberal order.

One third said they spent two hours or more each day on politics. But of these people, four out of five also said that \u201c<em>not one minute of that time</em> is spent on any kind of real political work. It\u2019s all TV news and podcasts \u2026 and social media and cheering and booing and complaining to friends and family.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMore likely than not,\u201d Hersh writes, \u201cif you\u2019re reading this, this book is about <em>you</em>.\u201d</p> <p>I have rarely felt a stronger sense of recognition reading any sentence in any book.</p> <p>Hersh\u2019s strategy to wean us away from the bottomless time waste of social media is to celebrate the power and effectiveness of real activists \u2013 the kind of people who actually spend more of their time in the street, rather than just staring at their phones or computer screens.</p> <p>\u201cIf you feel unfulfilled, melancholy, paralyzed by the sadness of the news and depth of our political problems\u201d, Hersh hopes to intrigue you with \u201ca form of politics where participants get power to improve their communities, present and future\u201d.</p> <p>His first example of a real activist is Lisa Mann, a Brooklyn architect who was inspired to go beyond \u201cbenign pseudo-engagement\u201d and join a group called <a href=\"https://www.ctctogether.org/about-us\">Changing the Conversation</a>, founded by Adam Barbanel-Fried.</p> <p>Mann has pioneered a new form of \u201cdeep canvassing\u201d in which volunteers talk to voters who are likely to oppose their side \u201cand build mutual understanding by listening and taking each person seriously\u201d \u2013 the sort of thing that absolutely never happens on Facebook.</p> <p>Mann undertook 20 canvassing shifts to help turn a New York City congressional district Democratic in 2018, when a war veteran named Max Rose won the usually Republican Staten Island part of the district by just 1,100 votes.</p> <p>As Dionne puts it, \u201cin democracy, persuasion is an imperative.\u201d</p> <p>Both authors point to the huge success of Democrats in retaking the House of Representatives in 2018 as a big reason to be hopeful about the outcome of the presidential election in 2020.</p> <p>Dionne points out the new majority of 2018 \u201cwas the product of the highest mid-term turnout since 1914\u201d \u2013 53.4% of all adults over 18 turned out to vote, while 62% of ballots \u201ccast by those who told exit pollsters that 2018 was their first vote in a midterm election\u201d were for Democrats.</p> <p>Dionne reports that of the 206 \u201cpivot counties\u201d that backed Trump in 2016 after voting twice for Obama, Democrats won 113 back in 2018, and cut Republican victory margins in 71 more.</p> <p>The big problem that Democrats face is an all-out assault on democracy by the Republican party, which began in earnest in 2013 when a conservative majority on the supreme court eviscerated the Voting Right Act of 1965, and Republican state legislatures passed a raft of bills designed to suppress minority voting.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/05/front-row-at-the-trump-show-review-jonathan-karl\">Front Row at the Trump Show review: Jonathan Karl's pre-pandemic warning</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As Trump bluntly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/30/trump-republican-party-voting-reform-coronavirus\">acknowledged</a> last month, if all eligible voters were permitted to vote, \u201cyou\u2019d never have a Republican elected in this country again\u201d.</p> <p>The supreme court fired another round in this hideous battle when it refused to extend the deadline for absentee voting <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/10/wisconsin-voter-restrictions-democracy-coronavirus-primary\">in last Tuesday\u2019s Wisconsin election</a>, forcing voters to risk their lives by casting their ballots in person during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p> <p>At the end of his book, Dionne pinpoints why it is so important to defeat all Republicans in November. It\u2019s because \u201ctheir approach to politics embodies a denial of the capacious \u2018We\u2019 our nation requires.\u201d</p> <p>Republicans have not only enabled Trump; they have also put us on a course \u201cto sustain levels of inequality that are incompatible\u201d with successful republican government \u2013 \u201cand our obligations to each other\u201d.</p>",

His office said he was improving and was back on his feet although his recovery was still at an early stage. <br><br>Britain imposed a lockdown three weeks ago in a bid to curb the spread of the virus and the government has come under increasing pressure to detail how long the strict measures on movements would last, with people forced to stay at home and many businesses unable to operate. <br><br>Ministers have said Britain needed to pass the peak of the outbreak before changes could be made, and Hancock said although the number of hospital admissions had started to flatten out, there was not enough evidence yet to have confidence they were past the worst. <br><br>\u201cOur judgement is we\u2019re not there yet. We haven\u2019t seen a flattening enough to be able to say that we\u2019ve reached the peak,\u201d he told BBC radio. <br><br>Some scientists have suggested the peak might still be some weeks off but Hancock said \u201cnobody knows\u201d when it would be. <br><br>\u201cThere\u2019s all sorts of suggestions. Their job is to make their best estimate and advise us and we have a whole load of different pieces of advice from different scientists,\u201d he said. <br><br>The death rate is also expected to increase over the next few days, health officials have cautioned, but they say they are hopeful that the lockdown will mean that the overall number of deaths will be below 20,000. <br><br>Initially Johnson took a more modest response to the outbreak than other European leaders but changed tack when projections suggested a quarter of a million people could die in the United Kingdom. <br><br>The government has come under fire for its initial response and a lack of preparedness, and there was criticism on Saturday from doctors and nurses who said they were having to treat patients without proper personal protective equipment (PPE) such as masks and gloves. <br><br>Among those to have died after testing positive for COVID-19 are 19 health care workers including 11 doctors. <br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e917c4b8f08db3109f20a5e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/sarah-marsh\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-11T08:15:35.026Z\">9.15am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Hello all.
