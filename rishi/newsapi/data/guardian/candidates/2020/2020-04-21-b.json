passengers on cancelled flights the option of a refund within 20 working days, via its website.</p> \n  <p>The airline has been forced to ground most of its fleet due to the pandemic, although it is still running a few <a href=\"https://www.ryanair.com/content/dam/ryanair/comms-2020/EN_20%20Apr%20Customer%20Notice%20-%20Covid19%20A4.pdf\">flights in and out of the UK</a>, mostly out of Dublin and Stansted.</p> \n  <p>Passengers were initially delighted, but a Ryanair email sent out on Monday, seen by the Guardian, has heralded an about-turn.</p> \n  <p>Instead of the refund, passengers have been sent a link telling them how told <a href=\"https://www.ryanair.com/ie/en/useful-info/refund-voucher\">how to use its vouchers</a> to purchase Ryanair flights and other services over the next 12 months.</p> \n  <p>Passengers can still request a cash refund, it states, but the request will be placed \u201cin the cash refund queue until the Covid-19 emergency has passed\u201d.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe highly recommend using the refund voucher as these are readily available and you can book flights on all Ryanair Group airlines in over 200 destinations,\u201d says the airline.</p> \n

all of the options set out under EU regulations, including refunds.\u201d</p> \n  <p>EU rules require the airlines to refund passengers on flights they cancel within seven days, but the airline industry across the board has ignored this over the last month, citing extraordinary circumstances.</p> \n  <p>EasyJet has since reintroduced the option of a cash refund online, while BA requires passengers to call the airline, which is near impossible at the moment.</p> \n  <p>The airlines can only offer credit vouchers with the consent of the passenger but this has not stopped the airlines and travel companies telling passengers, making this the only practical option. </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-21T17:10:58.696Z\">at 6.10pm

publicly for Apple and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/google\">Google</a> to weaken privacy protections around digital contact tracing, after its government admitted that its current plans would not work without changes to smartphone operating systems, <strong>Alex Hern</strong>, the Guardian\u2019s tech editor, reports.</p> \n  <p>The criticism comes two weeks after a landmark collaboration between the two companies to build technology enabling digital contact tracing apps, which would track contacts between users in an attempt to help slow the spread of Covid-19.</p> \n

Similar incidents were reported in areas of Strasbourg in eastern France.</p> \n  <p>This appears to be a spread of unrest following an incident in Villeneuve-la Garenne on Saturday evening in which a trail motorbike, ridden at speed by a man not wearing a helmet, hit the door of a police car stopped at a red traffic light.</p> \n  <p>An investigation is ongoing into the incident, which is the subject of conflicting claims: locals say officers opened the door of the unmarked police vehicle deliberately with the intention of injuring the rider, who was thrown from the bike and suffered a fractured femur. The man\u2019s family has announced it will sue the police, who deny the accusation its officers acted deliberately.</p> \n  <p>Seven people were arrested after the unrest on Sunday, which appears to have been sparked by rumours the injured man was so badly hurt he had his leg amputated; four were still in custody on Tuesday morning.</p> \n  <p>It has been reported in some UK media that the violence broke out because of French president Emmanuel Macron\u2019s decision to extend the country\u2019s strict lockdown until 11 May, but this seems unlikely as the extension was announced several days before the unrest began. However, tensions in the banlieues are especially high because of allegations of heavy-handed policing of the lockdown in the densely populated housing estates, which are home to many migrant and minority communities.</p> \n  <p>In Strasbourg, rubbish bins and a car were torched and Molotov cocktails were thrown at a police station. The local authorities said images posted on social media looked dramatic, but there was limited damage to the buildings.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-21T11:08:38.199Z\">at 12.08pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9ecdef8f08177aeb18acd7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-21T10:44:41.136Z\">11.44am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here\u2019s more on the decision to cancel this year\u2019s Oktoberfest in Bavaria, from the Guardian\u2019s correspondent in Germany, Kate Connolly.</p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>Bavaria\u2019s leaders have cancelled Oktoberfest, the world\u2019s biggest beer festival, due to fears that it could become a breeding ground for the coronavirus.</p> \n   <p>The 210-year-old festival, which attracts around six million visitors a year, is a major event in the German calendar.</p> \n   <p>Markus S\u00f6der, the premier of Bavaria, which has been one of the regions worst hit by the pandemic in Europe, said the Oktoberfest posed too big a public health risk.

Prof Lars Schaade, the RKI\u2019s vice-president, said: \u201cWe must systematically examine all the evidence, including through autopsies.\u201d</p> \n  <p>He said the decision to relax restrictions across Germany, which has seen some small shops opening, and pupils returning to school to sit exams this week, were \u201csensible\u201d from a societal point of view. But from a purely epidemiological viewpoint restrictions should remain in place. </p> \n  <p>The main aim remained ensuring the number of cases remained in a \u201csafe zone\u201d, he said. Germany\u2019s reproduction rate is 0.9 \u2013 up on Friday when it was 0.7 \u2013 which means every person contracting the illness is infecting a further person. The number of new cases are doubling every 20 days, the number of deaths every 12 days.</p> \n  <p>According to health authority figures this morning, Germany has more than 147,000 confirmed cases, and 4,912 people have died from the disease. Germany\u2019s mortality rate from coronavirus is at 3.2%. Schaade said it had risen, as the amount of infections and subsequent deaths in care homes and hospitals had increased.</p> \n  <p>He said test capacity was at 730,000 a week in Germany, but should ideally be around 1m, with everyone who has a respiratory illness or infection of the airway getting tested. However, he pointed to practical problems with upscaling testing due to a global lack of reagents.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"726dcf73d95a51741075c6cd4fec749c07b7dc70\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/726dcf73d95a51741075c6cd4fec749c07b7dc70/0_177_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lars Schaade, vice- president of the Robert-Koch-Institute.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lars Schaade, vice- president of the Robert-Koch-Institute.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bernd von Jutrczenka/AFP via Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Despite reports this morning that children are not spreading the disease as much as had been thought, Schaade said intensive tracking showed children who had contracted the disease in Germany were found to have as much of the virus in their throats as adults, even if they often show no symptoms. He said the RKI believed children played a not-insignificant role in spreading the disease.</p> \n  <p>Schaade said advice about stopping the spread of the virus remained the same, and would do so as long as there was no vaccination: keep a distance of 1.5 metres, cough into the elbow and wash your hands. He advised the wearing of face protection that covered the nose and mouth in public places.</p> \n  <p>He said intensive tracking of those who had been in contact with infected people remained an important part of the strategy to tackle coronavirus, and was a \u201cclassical epidemiological tool\u201d, enabling contacts to be \u201cfound and isolated so that they don\u2019t infect more people\u201d.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-21T10:37:00.485Z\">at 11.37am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9ec0c28f0895b8b228360c\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-21T09:54:31.972Z\">10.54am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Singapore lockdown extended until 1 June</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Singapore\u2019s prime minister Lee Hsien Loong has extended a lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus by four weeks until 1 June, after the city-state saw a sharp rise in cases.</p> \n  <p>The measures, which include the closures of most workplaces and schools, were initially set to run from 7 April until 4 May.</p> \n  <p>You can read the prime minister\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-pm-lee-full-speech-circuit-breaker-extended-june-1-12662056\">full speech here</a>.

The ballot is due to take place next week and Pichot has not entirely given up hope of overcoming the odds which, as ever, remain stacked against those operating outside the cosy Six Nations club.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4138\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Breakdown\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly rugby union email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>As it happens, Pichot and Beaumont are proud, respected rugby men and former national captains. Their manifestos, at first glance, are not poles apart. It is less about personalities, then, and more about priorities and open\u2011mindedness. World Rugby, a vast oil tanker that traditionally takes years to turn round, is being invited to hand the wheel to a new skipper more attuned to the renewable energy sector.</p> <p>If it feels like a significant moment, that is because it is. Starboard for eight more years of old-school diplomacy \u2013 by naming Bernard Laporte as his running mate, Beaumont may feel he is keeping the seat warm for the former France national coach \u2013 or port for something different.</p> <p>That the vote will be conducted by private ballot and the result not announced until 12 May says a fair amount about World Rugby\u2019s modus operandi. With the established nations permitted three votes while everyone else has to settle for two or one, this particular group of turkeys are not about to vote for Christmas. Self\u2011interest, as it has done for decades, shapes virtually everything.</p> <p>Some argue rugby already has enough to deal with and does not need any more apple carts upturned at this precise moment.

Assorted national unions and league governing bodies are copping plenty of flak but, in their defence, the range of problems now being faced is more extensive \u2013 and potentially more worrying \u2013 than at any time.</p> <p>There is a way out, though, for those leaders around the globe brave enough to grasp it. Why not, as the distinguished former Wallabies suggest, focus on doing the right thing, rather than taking the most expedient option? Why not engage more with the public and media and be frank and honest about the game\u2019s issues, rather than endlessly hiding behind corporate speak or ducking potentially awkward questions?</p> <p>Openness might just encourage greater understanding and forgiveness and pierce the current perception, unfair or not, of certain executives making a priority of bottom lines rather than players. Lead, in short, by example. Without trust, pride and respect at its heart, rugby is nothing.</p>",

  "<p>\u201cAre the Tories turning Britain into a one-party state?\u201d asks the headline on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/18/britain-one-party-state-tories-coronavirus-power\" title=\"\">Andy Beckett\u2019s article</a> (18 April). The answer is no. The mantra that Labour has lost four general elections is inaccurate. The 2010 election did not deliver a majority government and Labour could have continued in office had the Liberal Democrats chosen to support them.</p> <p>They certainly lost in 2015 but by no means to a large majority, which Theresa May then threw away for no good reason in 2017. The only reason that Labour was kept out of office \u2013 or at least the Tories were kept in place \u2013 was that the DUP decided to give their support on the basis of a political bribe.</p> <p>Only in 2019 did Labour lose badly, and the reasons for that are clear enough: the Corbyn leadership, mixed messages about Brexit, and a manifesto detached from reality. The Tories might currently have an 80-seat overall majority, and a section of the electorate might think they are doing a good job dealing with Covid-19, but the scandal of the Tory maladministration of the NHS has yet to have its full effect on electoral opinion. The next election, four years hence, is as open as any has ever been.<br><strong>Les Summers</strong><br><em>Tackley, Oxfordshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Andy Beckett asks a question that concerns us all. He makes several references to the UK as a functioning democracy and as such he struggles to explain how the UK is turning into a one-party state. A democracy should allow citizens a chance to direct their government according to their wishes. It has to acknowledge a fundamental truth that every one of us has our own unique set of values and opinions.</p> <p>We thus need a range of political parties to represent that range of diverse views. The first-past-the-post voting system is therefore anti-democratic, just allowing one \u201cwinner\u201d to take all. It invites nationalism and populism, which the Conservatives can offer. A proportional voting system is essential in a democracy and would allow voters to elect a range of different parties.</p> <p>There are plenty of other reasons why Conservatives have maintained their political power \u2013 a favourable press, better party funding, effective use of social media with Facebook and so on. But the most significant factor, and the one that has wide-reaching benefits to the political health of the UK, is PR.<br><strong>Dr Tim Williamson</strong><br><em>Bath</em></p> <p>\u2022 The Tories are not turning Britain into a one-party state \u2013 Labour are. The Corbyn era turned a once credible centre-left party into a hard-left personality cult riven by factional infighting and more concerned about \u201cwinning the argument\u201d than getting elected. Even after the recent election of Keir Starmer, Momentum put out a statement praising the previous leadership for having \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/apr/04/labour-leadership-election-winner-keir-starmer-long-bailey-nandy-and-jeremy-corbyns-successor-to-be-announced-at-1045am-live-news?page=with:block-5e8862b98f08c35a1d119e4a#block-5e8862b98f08c35a1d119e4a\" title=\"\">doubled the number of socialist MPs</a>\u201d \u2013 despite the fact that Labour now has fewer MPs than at any point since 1935. For as long as such attitudes prevail in the party at large, the Tories will be invulnerable.<br><strong>Daniel Peacock</strong><br><em>Manchester</em></p> <p>\u2022 Ironic that Andy Beckett thinks \u201cour democracy is healthier now than in the Blair years\u201d. Try telling that to the members of the Labour party who now know for certain that a faction of their party worked to undermine the democratically elected leadership, twice costing them an election (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/15/labour-must-turn-its-back-on-factionalism-says-keir-starmer\" title=\"\">Labour\u2019s Iain McNicol steps down from Lords role after report leak</a>, 15 April).<br><strong>John Airs</strong><br><em>Liverpool</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Read more Guardian letters \u2013 click here to visit </em></strong><a href=\"http://gu.com/letters\" title=\"\"><strong><em>gu.com/letters</em></strong></a></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Do you have a photo you\u2019d like to share with Guardian readers?

  "<p>Donald Trump has been accused of \u201cxenophobic scapegoating\u201d after announcing he will order a temporary ban on immigration into the US to combat the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>There were no other details on the timing, scope or legal basis of the president\u2019s proposed executive order and no official policy statement from the White House.</p> <p>Instead there was a lone tweet issued by Trump at 10.06pm on Monday. Without warning, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1252418369170501639?s=20\">he wrote:</a> \u201cIn light of the attack from the Invisible Enemy\u201d \u2013 a phrase he commonly applies to Covid-19 \u2013 \u201cas well as the need to protect the jobs of our GREAT American Citizens, I will be signing an Executive Order to temporarily suspend immigration into the United States!\u201d</p> <p>The post generated instant uncertainty. Similar moves by Trump in the past have triggered mayhem at airports in America and beyond as well as legal challenges. Such an order would be a far-reaching use of executive power from a president who last week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/trump-us-coronavirus-briefing-latest-media\">claimed he had \u201ctotal\u201d authority over states\u2019 efforts</a> to reopen their economies.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/18/the-virus-doesnt-discriminate-but-governments-do-latinos-disproportionately-hit-by-coronavirus\">'The virus doesn't discriminate but governments do': Latinos disproportionately hit by coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p> </p> <p>Trump\u2019s tweet about suspending immigration was curiously timed on a day in which he claimed many areas hardest hit by the virus had \u201cturned the corner\u201d and as he actively foments protests against the lockdown. On Tuesday White House officials offered competing justifications for the measure.</p> <p>Robert O\u2019Brien, the national security adviser, told the Fox News channel: \u201cWe\u2019re trying to do everything, the president\u2019s trying to do everything he can to put the health of the American people first during this crisis. So this is one step. It\u2019s not dissimilar to the restrictions on travel from China that he implemented back on January 29 at the very outset of this public health crisis.\u201d</p> <p>But with more than 22 million people filing for unemployment aid in recent weeks, the White House press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, put the emphasis on jobs: \u201cAs President Trump has said, \u2018Decades of record immigration have produced lower wages and higher unemployment for our citizens, especially for African-American and Latino workers.\u2019 At a time when Americans are looking to get back to work, action is necessary.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s tweet did not make clear which immigration programmes might be affected. Nearly all visa processing by the state department, including immigrant visas, has been on hold during the pandemic. Asylum claims have also been suspended in effect, with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/us-asylum-seekers-coronavirus-law-un\">thousands of people being swiftly returned to Mexico without due process</a><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2020/04/09/us/ap-us-virus-outbreak-border-enforcement.html\">,</a> which the UN has described as a violation of international and US law.</p> <p>The abrupt move provoked fierce criticism from immigration rights groups. Andrea Flores, deputy policy director of the American Civil Liberties Union\u2019s equality division, said: \u201cUnfortunately, President Trump seems more interested in fanning anti-immigrant flames than in saving lives. We cannot allow President Trump to exploit this pandemic to advance his racism and xenophobia.\u201d</p> <p>Democrats suggested the president was seeking to distract from his own mishandling of the pandemic. Congressman Don Beyer of Virginia tweeted: \u201cFrom the beginning Trump has flailed about seeking someone to blame for his own failure. Obama. Governors. China. Speaker Pelosi. People of Asian descent.</p> <p>\u201cImmigration has nearly stopped and the US has far more cases than any other country. This is just xenophobic scapegoating.\u201d</p> <p>Congressman Joaqu\u00edn Castro of Texas, the chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, added: \u201cThis action is not only an attempt to divert attention away from Trump\u2019s failure to stop the spread of the coronavirus and save lives, but an authoritarian-like move to take advantage of a crisis and advance his anti-immigrant agenda. We must come together to reject his division.\u201d</p> <p>Moe Vela, a former senior adviser on Latino affairs to the then vice-president Joe Biden, said: \u201cHe wants to distract again. He castigates and casts blame as he tries to take it away from himself. He shirked his most fundamental responsibility as the president of this nation and that\u2019s to keep us safe.

Two Amnesty International reports have also condemned Kean, who was put in charge of the Fiji prison service in 2016, and the environment surrounding him.</p> <p>World Rugby had pledged to investigate the allegations of homophobia against Kean as they contravened the governing body\u2019s code of conduct, but initially said it cannot influence who the FRU selects as its representative for the council. Sufficient pressure has been put on the FRU, however, to ensure Kean has been stood down. The FRU\u2019s chief executive, John O\u2019Connor, has replaced him on World Rugby\u2019s council.</p> <p>\u201cWorld Rugby takes all allegations of behaviour that is not in keeping with the sport\u2019s strong and inclusive values and bylaws extremely seriously,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.world.rugby/news/568656\" title=\"\">read a statement</a>. \u201cWhile it is important to stress that any allegations must be validated, following dialogue with World Rugby, the Fiji Rugby Union recognises the seriousness of the allegations made and the need for them to be fully investigated, and that it is in the best interests of the sport that Mr Kean steps down from the council and his executive committee candidature be withdrawn.\u201d</p> <p>Kean\u2019s resignation eases the pressure on Beaumont but his bid for re-election is still likely to be tarnished. His nomination was seconded by the FRU and while he would insist it came from the union rather than Kean, many will consider that to be splitting hairs.</p> <p>Kean, furthermore, who is the brother-in-law of Fiji\u2019s prime minister, was backed in his attempt to join the executive committee by the French federation\u2019s president, Bernard Laporte, who is running to be Beaumont\u2019s vice-chairman.</p> <p>Voting in the election for the chairmanship \u2013 in which the former Argentina captain Agust\u00edn Pichot is also running \u2013 as well as the executive committee, begins next week but the results will not be announced until 12 May.</p> <p>A key part of Beaumont\u2019s manifesto is an overhaul of World Rugby\u2019s governance, including the introduction of a fit-and-proper persons test which Kean would have fallen foul of before his nomination.</p> <p>In his open letter Leo wrote: \u201cIf the values of World Rugby really are integrity, respect, solidarity, passion and discipline, all of this \u2013 and the claim to have been building character since 1823 \u2013 will be utterly debased if Kean is elected to the [executive committee].\u201d</p>",

  "<p>The decade that followed the return of Joe Brown from national service to Manchester in 1950 was a crucial one in the exploration of Britain\u2019s rock outcrops and mountain crags and brought him a heroic status in the sport. Brown, who has died aged 89, was involved in the Rock and Ice Climbing Club, founded in 1951 by a group of Manchester climbers.</p> <p>He developed a partnership with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2005/mar/06/features.sportmonthly1\" title=\"\">Don Whillans</a> that was to become the most significant in modern climbing history. As a team, they were formidable, the boldness and physical strength of the slightly younger Whillans balancing Brown\u2019s inspired improvisations and innate rock-sense.</p> <p>The stages for the Rock and Ice advance were the Derbyshire outcrops and the range of cliffs along the north side of the Llanberis Pass in Snowdonia. On the August bank holiday of 1951, Brown joined forces with Whillans in an attempt on the right wall of Cenotaph Corner on Dinas Cromlech in the Llanberis Pass. Their first attempt ended in retreat as a cloudburst soaked the rock.</p> <p>A month later they were back, and this time succeeded on a route that was a psychological breakthrough in its acceptance of unremitting steepness and exposure, loose rock and poor protection. They called it Cemetery Gates, after a name Brown saw on the destination board of a bus as he returned through Chester that night. That October, the pair fought up Vember on Clogwyn Du\u2019r Arddu \u2013 Brown\u2019s second attempt after a near disaster two years previously \u2013 and the Rock and Ice revolution was under way.</p> <p>The activities of this group \u2013 and Brown in particular \u2013 expanded to include the French Alps, where British climbing had scarcely advanced for 50 years. On their first visit in 1953 the Brown-Whillans team made the third ascent in a very fast time of the recent Magnone route on the West Face of the Petit Dru \u2013 then deemed the hardest rock-climb in the Alps; they went on to climb an even harder line of their own on the West Face of the Aiguille de Blaiti\u00e8re that very soon gained and long retained a reputation for extreme difficulty.</p> <p>As a result, Brown was invited to join Charles Evans\u2019s reconnaissance expedition in 1955 to the 28,169ft <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/place/Kanchenjunga\" title=\"\">Kanchenjunga</a>, the world\u2019s third highest peak and its highest unclimbed one at that time. Brown\u2019s acceptance, and apparent refusal to press for Whillans\u2019s inclusion \u2013 something he was in no position to do \u2013 was seen by the latter as a betrayal, and the two men, who had never been close friends, climbed less frequently together thereafter.</p> <p>The climb was far harder, more arduous and committing than the 1953 ascent of Everest. Brown led the final difficult rock pitch to the top, minus four feet, as an undertaking had been given to the King of Nepal not to tread on the actual summit of this holy mountain. His fame thereafter was assured. He followed up this success in 1956 with the first ascent of the Mustagh Tower, a 24,000ft rock spire in the Karakoram.</p> <p>By 1956 Brown had established himself as the most considerable all-round mountaineer in the history of the sport in Britain. His first ascents on Pennine, Welsh, Cumbrian and Scottish rock had significantly advanced the concept of the climbable; in the Alps and the Himalayas his record was no less impressive.</p> <p>He continued to climb into his old age and the list of his achievements grew longer with the years. His last recorded new climbs, on Welsh slate and in the Anti-Atlas of Morocco, were accomplished in his late 70s. But after those two great Himalayan ascents of the mid-1950s, his climbing involvement was more relaxed. </p> <p>In 1957 he married Valerie Gray. The horizons of his activity broadened. He began to be in demand for TV work, where his flinty, humorous commentary, phlegmatic even when in extremis, acted as anchor to outside broadcasts from places as far apart as the Valley of the Assassins in Iran, Welsh sea and mountain cliffs, Alpine aiguilles, Scottish sea-stacks and a wintry Ben Nevis.</p> <p>In 1967 he was one of those climbing the Old Man of Hoy, off Orkney, in an ascent televised by the BBC. <a href=\"https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/bafd5d5378ca4a1389fd6f18196c4c2d\" title=\"\">In 1984 he repeated the experience</a> with his younger daughter, Zoe, whose character came over as being as amused and engaging as his own. He even made a quirky series of television shorts about fishing in inaccessible places and acted as Jeremy Irons\u2019 double in the waterfall sequences of The Mission (1986) \u2013 the fact that Irons towered over him by almost a foot was concealed by careful camerawork.</p> <p>There was a measured wit and gravity and a light mocking touch about his screen persona that held true in all the relationships of his life. He instructed for a time at White Hall Outdoor Pursuits Centre in Derbyshire, where he found time to master canoeing. He loved to fish, alone or with close friends.</p> <p>He had new phases of intense exploratory activity on British rock. In the early 60s he combed the secretive valleys of southern Snowdonia for small, steep crags on which he sketched out the early masterpieces of climbing\u2019s modern age: Vector, Pellagra, Dwm, Hardd, Ferdinand. In 1965 he moved to Llanberis and opened the first of a small chain of outdoor equipment shops.</p> <p>He had significant climbing partnerships with men of younger generations. With Peter Crew, he developed the awesome sea-cliffs of Gogarth and South Stack, in Anglesey, producing an extraordinary series of routes: Mousetrap, Mammoth, Red Wall, Doppelganger, Wendigo. He continued to produce classic and teasing climbs long after Crew had failed to keep pace with his zeal, and made significant ascents of difficult peaks in the Andes.</p> <p>In the Himalayas he forged an alliance with Mo Anthoine and enjoyed trip after light-hearted trip \u2013 many of them unsuccessful in reaching their objectives and that did not matter to him one iota \u2013 to difficult peaks in Garhwal and elsewhere. Even in his 60s he took part in an expedition dogged by bad weather to Everest\u2019s then unclimbed north-north-east ridge.</p> <p>Born in Ardwick, Manchester, Joe was the seventh and last child of a poor Roman Catholic family. His father died when Joe was eight months old. Thereafter, his mother provided for the family through cleaning work and taking in laundry. </p> <p>Joe left school at 14 to work for a jobbing builder. From Manchester, the Pennine moors were no more than a bus-ride away: \u201cBy my 12th birthday, I knew that going into the country was more satisfying to me than anything else,\u201d he wrote. At first it was just playing around, then it gravitated to mine exploration in the abandoned copper workings at Alderley Edge and pot-holing in the White Peak. Inevitably, the progression was to climbing. For Brown this began among the arctic conditions of early 1947 in hobnailed boots at Kinder Downfall, above Hayfield, Derbyshire.</p> <p>The rapidity with which Brown became perhaps the most significant figure in British climbing history was astounding. Within weeks this short, slight 16-year-old had begun to lead mountain rock-climbs at the highest contemporary standard. His native talent needed an educated and organisational ability to lead it on to fame and achievement. He found it through a chance meeting at Kinder Downfall in the spring of 1947 with Merrick \u201cSlim\u201d Sorrell.</p> <p>Sorrell, three years older than Brown, was a pipe-fitter from Stockport whose solid and knowledgable company underpinned the first phase of Brown\u2019s pioneering on rock. That their ability was notably higher than the prevailing standards of the day was established on a visit to North Wales. They had viewed the climb known as Lot\u2019s Groove on the cliffs of Glyder Fach \u2013 alleged to be one of the harder climbs in Wales \u2013 and accomplished it on sight.</p> <p>On the same holiday Brown made an ascent of the Suicide Wall in Cwm Idwal \u2013 undoubtedly the hardest climb of its time in Britain. \u201cI didn\u2019t find it too bad,\u201d he told me many years later. By the summer of 1948, having mastered the most difficult of the existing climbs, he began turning out his own repertoire. Initially these climbs were on Derbyshire and Yorkshire gritstone edges \u2013 brutally steep outcrops of abrasive rock in the ascent of which Brown displayed a suavely rhythmical and relaxed genius.</p> <p>His ability was now bolstered by being right at the centre of a group of climbers from the Manchester and Derby areas, the Valkyrie Club. On crags such as Stanage and Froggatt Edges, Wimberry Rocks and Dovestones, the routes that marked British rock-climbing\u2019s postwar revolution and were to bring it in line with prewar continental standards were forged.</p> <p>Long-standing problems feared and revered by the sport\u2019s elders were vanquished beneath the insouciant plimsolls of a ragged and humorous 17-year-old youth. As a young climber myself in Manchester at the start of the 60s, I was intensely aware of his presence and how much he had achieved by then.</p> <p>I could understand how the other greats of the period climbed: fitness, physique, supple gymnasticism or sheer application. With Brown, there was something else at work. He was quite short, not heavily built, his movement smooth and deliberate.</p> <p>When I climbed with him, sometimes I would watch the way he made a move, copy it when I came to that point, and his way, that he had seen instantly, would be the least obvious and most immediately right. He was climbing\u2019s supreme craftsman, unerringly aware of the medium. That instinctual rock-sense never entirely left him.</p> <p>And with him, too, came a character generous, playful and straightforward. His mind may not have been academically trained, but he was sharp, informed, argumentative, and I think very wise. He loved the contest, be it physical or intellectual; he loved to wrestle.</p> <p>Once, after a first ascent on the Pembrokeshire sea cliffs with a lot of crumbling rock, I followed him and found him sitting on the cliff edge. He pulled me to the ground and boxed me about the ears for risking his life and limb, scolding me for what he called the loosest route he had ever done. But he was laughing, and we ran back in perfect humour across the unmarked beach.</p> <p>He needed the simplicity of that conflict and he was still generous and endearingly funny as he endured with dignity the ill-health of his final years.</p> <p>He is survived by Valerie, their two daughters, Helen and Zoe, and four grandchildren.</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em>Joseph Brown, mountaineer, born 29 September 1930; died 15 April 2020</p>",

Early in July 1960, the very same week he was nominated to be the Democratic candidate for the presidency, Kennedy was playing Cypress Point in Monterey. At the par-three 15th he hit a fine five-iron off the tee and watched the ball land on the front left of the green and kick straight on towards the hole.</p> <p>\u201cGo in. Go in,\u201d cried Kennedy\u2019s friend Paul Fay. But Kennedy begged for his ball to miss. He let out his breath when it stopped six inches short. \u201cIf that ball had gone into the hole,\u201d he said to Fay, \u201cin less than an hour the word would be out that another golfer was trying to get into the White House.\u201d Kennedy was so rattled he asked Fay what it would have cost in hush money to keep the two caddies quiet.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fc1c749eb0d0e4e5ee13a4eb3c59b08131e69035\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc1c749eb0d0e4e5ee13a4eb3c59b08131e69035/0_823_2514_2177/1000.jpg\" alt=\"President Dwight Eisenhower (right) shares a laugh with Arnold Palmer before a round of foursomes at the Gettysburg Country Club in 1960.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"866\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">President Dwight Eisenhower (right) shares a laugh with Arnold Palmer before a round of foursomes at the Gettysburg Country Club in 1960.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Vathis/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They say Kennedy was the best player among all the presidents, just a whit better than his predecessor Dwight Eisenhower, \u201cand if Kennedy played as often as Eisenhower did\u201d, AP once reported, \u201cthere\u2019d be no contest\u201d. Eisenhower had played 800 rounds in the eight years he was in office, had a practice range installed in the White House basement and a putting green outside his office door. When Kennedy finally moved in he found that the wooden floor of the Oval Office was pitted with cleat marks.</p> <p>Which was precisely why Kennedy didn\u2019t want anyone to know he played, too. So he tried hard to keep it secret.

  "<p>This weekend thousands of rightwing Americans took to the streets in several states to protest against the coronavirus \u201clockdowns\u201d, or stay-at-home rules, issued by their governors. Although most of the protests were marginal \u2013 counting dozens of people at best \u2013 conservative and liberal media outlets devoted considerable attention to them.</p> \n<p>Although officially protesting against the lockdowns\u2019 economic costs and what they viewed as infringements on their liberty, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/18/stay-at-home-order-protest-lockdown-maryland-texas-ohio\">the protesters</a> were expressing the usual hodgepodge of rightwing grievances. As always, opposition to abortion and immigration and support for President Trump and the second amendment were prominent.</p> \n<p>But perhaps my favorite slogan was a surprising one <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChrChristensen/status/1251895654730915840\">spotted</a> at a rally in Minnesota: \u201cBe like Sweden\u201d. For years, Sweden has been the poster child of the US far right\u2019s feverish dystopias of European \u201csocialism\u201d \u2013 Breitbart, in particular, has an unhealthy obsession with the country. To see American rightwingers champion one of the few European countries still governed by a leftwing government is therefore truly astounding.</p> \n<p>The anti-lockdown protesters have obvious parallels with the early Tea Party mobilization of 2009, down to their prominent display of the Gadsden flag \u2013 the yellow flag with the picture of a snake and the text \u201cDon\u2019t tread on me\u201d, a historical American symbol appropriated by the Tea Party.</p> \n<p>The Tea Party movement was the most important US political movement of the early 21st century, but it has been almost completely written out of US political history in the wake of Donald Trump\u2019s shock electoral victory. Conservatives and liberals have always interpreted the Tea Party through their own ideological lenses: where conservatives saw a spontaneous grassroots movement, liberals saw an \u201cAstroturf\u201d operation bankrolled and organized by powerful rightwing interests.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>For the sake of Trump's re-election, he is keen to move discussion from public health to the economy</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>A similar split in narratives has emerged over the anti-lockdown protests. Conservative media outlets have emphasized the grassroots aspect of the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-lockdown-rebellion-11587400850\">Lockdown Rebellion</a>\u201d, staying quiet about the protests\u2019 financial and organizational connections. In contrast, liberal media outlets have focused primarily on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/far-right-coronavirus-protests-restrictions\">these ties</a>, notably to the family of Trump\u2019s secretary of education, <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/coronavirus-updates/2020/04/a-devos-linked-group-promoted-the-right-wing-operation-gridlock-tantrum-in-michigan/\">Betsy DeVos</a>, a longtime and generous funder of rightwing political causes.</p> \n<p>Just like the Tea Party, the anti-lockdown protests are a combination of Astroturf and grassroots. In the case of the Tea Party, the two were united on socio-economic issues \u2013 \u201cTaxed Enough Already\u201d \u2013 but divided over socio-cultural issues, mostly because the Astroturf branch did not want to weaken the movement amid potential divisions over immigration and religious issues like abortion. While Americans for Prosperity and FreedomWorks, the well-financed rightwing groups that supported the movement, were successful in keeping the supportive rightwing media on socio-economic message, socio-cultural issues often dominated at the grassroots level, with opposition to abortion and immigration as well as thinly veiled racism focused on President Obama (including birtherism, the false idea that Obama was not born in the US).</p> \n<p>There is one crucial difference between these two rightwing protests, however: while the Tea Party attacked the White House, the anti-lockdown protesters clearly support it. In fact, Trump and the protesters are cheering each other on publicly. Pro-Trump banners are omnipresent at the protests, and Trump has repeatedly praised the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/17/trump-liberate-tweets-coronavirus-stay-at-home-orders\">very responsible</a>\u201d protesters.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/20/us-protests-lockdown-coronavirus-cases-surge-warning\">US anti-lockdown rallies could cause surge in Covid-19 cases, experts warn</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>On Friday, when rightwingers were announcing their protests on social media, the president loudly encouraged them in a series of all-caps tweets: \u201cLIBERATE MINNESOTA!\u201d, \u201cLIBERATE MICHIGAN!\u201d, \u201cLIBERATE VIRGINIA\u201d. An interesting selection of states, which shows that there is more at stake than just frustrations over the lockdown.</p> \n<p>Almost <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/us-map-stay-at-home-orders-lockdowns-2020-3\">95%</a> of Americans are under \u201clockdown\u201d at the moment; 42 states have issued stay-at-home orders. This includes many states with Republican governors, however late and reluctantly they came to that decision. But the protests largely target states with Democratic governors. Moreover, the three states singled out by President Trump in his tweets are key targets of his 2020 campaign \u2013 holding Michigan and flipping Minnesota are crucial for his re-election. He hopes to swing Virginia by mobilizing rightwing voters on gun rights and the lockdown.</p> \n<p>For Trump, the anti-lockdown protests provide him with visible popular support for his Covid-19 strategy. For the sake of his re-election, he is keen to move discussion from public health to the economy. Given that a <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-04-16/coronavirus-protests-dumb-lockdown-rules-erode-public-trust\">clear majority</a> of Americans support the stay-at-home policies, Trump needs the momentum to shift. The protests can help him, by taking his struggle from the White House to the streets, and thereby to the media.</p> \n<p>However \u2013 as many Republicans found out the hard way, in the Tea Party era - the streets are more difficult to control than lobby organizations and rightwing media.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Cas Mudde is a Guardian US columnist and the Stanley Wade Shelton UGAF professor in the school of public and international affairs at the University of Georgia.

And not only did we catch it, we are now the king of ventilators all over the world.<br><br>\u201cWe have thousands being made a week and they\u2019re very high quality and that wasn\u2019t playing well, so then they said, \u2018Testing, testing, ah, we\u2019ll get him on testing\u2019. Well, testing is much easier than ventilators.\u201d<br><br>In fact governors\u2019 demands for ventilators were based on the White House\u2019s own projections and, far from being new, their pleas for testing go back many weeks. Trump\u2019s words are also unlikely to comfort the afflicted for whom a ventilator is a lifeline.<br><br>Later at Monday\u2019s briefing, the president\u2019s ability to show empathy was again in question. </p> \n  <p>Yamiche Alcindor of PBS News recalled one of her interviewees: \u201cA man said his entire family got sick because they listened to you and didn\u2019t stay home. Are you concerned that downplaying the virus got people sick?\u201d<br><br>Trump\u2019s stunning reply: \u201cA lot of people love Trump, right. A lot of people love me, you see them all the time, right. I guess I\u2019m here for a reason. To the best of my knowledge, I won, and I think we\u2019re gonna win again. I think we\u2019re gonna win in a landslide.\u201d<br><br>The president went on to tout his travel restrictions on China, adding that \u201cbefore March\u201d he also banned travel from Europe (it was in fact announced on 11 March). The back and forth continued. Trump asserted: \u201cI haven\u2019t left the White House in months except for a brief moment to give a wonderful ship, the Comfort \u2013\u201d<br><br>Alcindor interjected, accurately: \u201cYou held a rally in March.\u201d<br><br>Caught red-handed, the president said: \u201cI don\u2019t know. Did I hold a rally? I\u2019m sorry, I hold a rally. Did I hold a rally?\u201d<br><br>For a moment, the illusionist\u2019s mask had slipped.

It was all ventilators ... We did a great job with the ventilators.\u201d He said \u201cat some point soon\u201d, the US would be helping Mexico and Italy with ventilators. </p> \n  <p>It is true that some states, so far, have ended up with more ventilators than they originally projected they would need. California has loaned 500 ventilators to states like New York. California hospitals managed to increase their stock from 7,500 machines to more than 11,000, according to the state\u2019s governor, Gavin Newsom. \u201cThat has put less strain and pressure on the state\u2019s effort to procure additional ventilators,\u201d Newsom said.</p> \n  <p>However, that doesn\u2019t mean that there isn\u2019t a national shortage. The US has roughly 173,000 ventilators, according to the Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins University. Experts from Harvard Medical School predict that the US could end up needing <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2005689\">31 times that number</a> to treat coronavirus patients. </p> \n  <p>An article in the <a href=\"https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nejm.org%2Fdoi%2Ffull%2F10.1056%2FNEJMp2006141\">New England Journal of Medicine published on Wednesday 25 March </a>categorically concluded that the US does not have enough ventilators to treat patients with Covid-19 in the coming months.</p> \n  <p>The authors, American public health experts, wrote: \u201cThere is a broad range of estimates of the number of ventilators we will need to care for U.S. patients with Covid-19, from several hundred thousand to as many as a million. The estimates vary depending on the number, speed, and severity of infections, of course, but even the availability of testing affects the number of ventilators needed.... current estimates of the number of ventilators in the United States range from 60,000 to 160,000, depending on whether those that have only partial functionality are included. The national strategic reserve of ventilators is small and far from sufficient for the projected gap.

That is significantly better than rates in hard hit countries such as Italy, Spain, the UK and France, and similar overall to Iran, which was also an early hotspot. But death rates are higher in the US than Germany, South Korea, Japan, Australia, and many other countries. </p> \n  <p>The death rate in China had been recorded as 4% of cases and 0.2 deaths per 100,000 population. That was before the Chinese government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/china-denies-cover-up-as-wuhan-coronavirus-deaths-revised-up-50\">increased</a> the official death toll from Wuhan, the original base of the outbreak, by 50%. And there are ongoing questions about all of China\u2019s reported numbers in relation to the coronavirus.</p> \n  <p>Meanwhile, the New York Times has published a long and useful <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/17/us/coronavirus-death-rate.html\">article</a> detailing the enormous difficulties in pinpointing death rates in different countries and even different areas and populations within countries.</p> \n  <p>The virus swept in so quickly and is still so relatively new that we are only now grasping that there may be huge numbers of people who have or had Covid-19 without showing symptoms, have not been tested or who died at home or in a care home without that death ever being verified as resulting from coronavirus.</p> \n  <p>The New York Times gives a rough rule of thumb that, according to various unofficial Covid-19 trackers that calculate the death rate by dividing total deaths by the <a href=\"https://qap.ecdc.europa.eu/public/extensions/COVID-19/COVID-19.html\">number of known cases</a>, about 6.4% of people infected with the virus have now died worldwide. But it adds that \u201chealth officials and epidemiologists have estimated there are five to 10 people with infections for every confirmed case in some communities, and at least one estimate suggests there are far more\u201d.</p> \n  <p>So ultimately the worldwide death rate, if it can ever be verified, is likely to be a much, much lower number than currently understood. And data for the US and other countries could change a lot going forward.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-20T22:03:43.249Z\">at 11.03pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9e15c48f0895b8b228320d\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-20T21:41:00.495Z\">10.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Trump press conference begins</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The president is at the podium now, talking about his guidelines for reopening the country. </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9e148d8f08ce473efe2a17\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-20T21:35:20.852Z\">10.35pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Joe Biden gets progressive House endorsements</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>While we wait for the White House briefing to begin, here\u2019s some quick non-coronavirus news: a number of former Bernie Sanders\u2019 supporters in Congress have officially endorsed Joe Biden: </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/cmarinucci/status/1252295568086335490\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">New!
