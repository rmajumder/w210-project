Southern states such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/state-of-georgi\">Georgia</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/texas\">Texas</a> were among the first to allow shops and businesses to reopen.</p> \n   <p>\u201cVaccine or no vaccine, we\u2019re back,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/15/trump-coronavirus-warp-speed-vaccine-white-house\">Trump said in the White House rose garden</a> on Friday while announcing a major <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/the-race-for-a-vaccine-how-trumps-america-first-approach-slows-the-global-search\">US drive to create a coronavirus vaccine</a>.</p> \n   <p>Polls show Biden beating Trump in battleground states but <a href=\"https://watson.brown.edu/people/faculty-fellows/schiller\">Wendy Schiller,</a> a political science professor at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, warns that he still faces political traps.</p> \n   <p>\u201cThe fundamental problem for the Democratic party is that in order to defeat Trump, they almost have to cheerlead for a bad economy and they also have to cheerlead for new [coronavirus] hotspots in swing states. It sounds gruesome, but really that\u2019s so far what they\u2019re banking on to beat Trump.</p> \n   <p>\u201cAnd in this case, Trump is absolutely smarter than that and what he is offering, not only his base but voters in swing states, is hope. It\u2019d actually be reminiscent, in a much less articulate way, of Ronald Reagan.

It\u2019s pretty much Democrat versus Republican, top-to-bottom.\u201d</p> <p>Reports suggest that the pandemic has been sucked into America\u2019s political polarisation and culture wars.</p> <p>Many protesters, taking their lead from Trump, refuse to wear face masks or maintain physical distance. \u201cScience is no match for tribalism in this dysfunctional country,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/12/opinion/coronavirus-masks.htm\">wrote Frank Bruni,</a> a New York Times columnist. \u201cAnd protective masks, God help us, are tribal totems.\u201d</p> <p>Fallone has seen evidence of the trend in Wisconsin. \u201cI\u2019m on various political Facebook groups throughout Wisconsin and you can see on social media the difference between people who react when they run into folks who aren\u2019t wearing face masks and who are upset about it, and then other folks who are mocking anyone who tries to social distance,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"96a601925a9a8991a9c6cf60a089041b7d675d94\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/96a601925a9a8991a9c6cf60a089041b7d675d94/0_30_2892_1736/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer has been a target of protestors\u2019 anger\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer has been a target of protestors\u2019 anger.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s become very political. People take their cues from their leaders and so, on the Republican side, people are taking their cues from the Trump administration and the state Republican party leaders who are consistently talking about freedom and liberty and go where you want, do what you want. And on the Democrat side, people are trying to follow the governor\u2019s recommendations and engage in social distancing and wear face masks.\u201d</p> <p>Confirmed coronavirus cases in Michigan crossed 50,000 while Covid-19 deaths rose slightly to 4,825, the state health department said on Friday. More than 11,000 cases had been identified in Wisconsin as of Thursday night, according to a New York Times database, and at least 434 people had died. More than 63,000 cases had been identified in Pennsylvania as of Thursday night, along with about 4,300 deaths, the Times reported.</p> <p>Just as in the 2016, the swing states bring national trends into sharp focus. Democratic governors across the country have generally urged caution, particularly in major cities, citing concerns for public health from a virus that has killed more than 85,000 people in the US \u2013 more than any other country in the world.</p> <p>But Republican governors have tended to err on the side of reopening faster, alarmed that more than 36m Americans have submitted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/us-unemployment-and-employment-statistics\">unemployment</a> claims since mid-March and retail sales dipped 16.4% last month. Southern states such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/state-of-georgi\">Georgia</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/texas\">Texas</a> were among the first to allow shops and businesses to reopen.</p> <p> \u201cVaccine or no vaccine, we\u2019re back,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/15/trump-coronavirus-warp-speed-vaccine-white-house\">Trump said in the White House rose garden</a> on Friday while announcing a major <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/12/the-race-for-a-vaccine-how-trumps-america-first-approach-slows-the-global-search\">US drive to create a coronavirus vaccine</a>.</p> <p>Polls show Biden beating Trump in battleground states but <a href=\"https://watson.brown.edu/people/faculty-fellows/schiller\">Wendy Schiller,</a> a political science professor at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, warns that he still faces political traps.</p> <p>\u201cThe fundamental problem for the Democratic party is that in order to defeat Trump, they almost have to cheerlead for a bad economy and they also have to cheerlead for new [coronavirus] hotspots in swing states. It sounds gruesome, but really that\u2019s so far what they\u2019re banking on to beat Trump.</p> <p>\u201cAnd in this case, Trump is absolutely smarter than that and what he is offering, not only his base but voters in swing states, is hope. It\u2019d actually be reminiscent, in a much less articulate way, of Ronald Reagan. He\u2019s basically saying, \u2018I got you to the promised land economically once, I will get you back to the promised land economically again\u2019.</p> <p>Schiller added: \u201cTrump will run on a message of hope from now until November, and he\u2019ll basically dare the Democrats to prove him wrong. And then he\u2019ll say, \u2018You don\u2019t believe in America. You\u2019re betting against America.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very interesting corner that he\u2019s boxing the Democrats into and I think they\u2019re hoping that people realise that the mismanagement of messaging on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/27/what-is-covid-19\">Covid</a> and additional things like tariffs against China and supply chains undermine Trump, but those are very sophisticated arguments to make. When the Democrats have to make sophisticated arguments, the Democrats lose. The good news for the Democrats, the only saving grace, is that Joe Biden <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/13/joe-biden-trump-2020-election\">can speak swing state language.\u201d</a></p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump has announced details of a \u201cwarp-speed\u201d effort to create a coronavirus vaccine by the end of the year, even as experts warn that such a breakthrough could take longer than 18 months.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/15/coronavirus-us-live-house-vote-stimulus-package-donald-trump-latest-news-updates\">Coronavirus US live: Trump's press conference disrupted by trucker protest</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>During remarks in the White House Rose Garden on Friday that had to compete with honking from protesting truck drivers, however, the US president also urged schools to reopen in the autumn and insisted: \u201cVaccine or no vaccine, we\u2019re back.\u201d</p> \n<p>Unveiling details of \u201cOperation Warp Speed\u201d, a name that references a concept popularised by Star Trek and other science fiction, Trump said: \u201cThat means big and it means fast. A massive scientific, industrial and logistical endeavour unlike anything our country has seen since the Manhattan Project.\u201d</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cIts objective is to finish developing and then manufacture and distribute a proven coronavirus vaccine as fast as possible. Again, we\u2019d love to see if we can do it prior to the end of the year.\u201d</p> \n<p>Standing just behind him, Anthony Fauci, an infectious diseases expert wearing a face mask, cast his glance down and reached to adjust his tie. Trump did not wear a face mask.</p> \n<p>In testimony to Congress on Tuesday, Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, warned: \u201cThere\u2019s no guarantee that the vaccine is actually going to be effective.\u201d</p> \n<p>And on Thursday Rick Bright, the ousted head of a government agency seeking a vaccine, told Congress: \u201cNormally, it takes up to 10 years to make a vaccine. A lot of optimism is swirling around a 12-to-18-month time frame, if everything goes perfectly. We\u2019ve never seen everything go perfectly.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump said the government would invest in all the top vaccine candidates and said a list had been narrowed to 14 promising possibilities with a plan to narrow further. The initiative will work with the US military and other countries, accelerate the typical regulatory process and mobilise to get a vaccine distributed once one is in place.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s never been a vaccine project anywhere in history like this,\u201d Trump continued, in what appeared to be a break from the script, slicing the air with his right hand. \u201cAnd I just want to make something clear. It\u2019s very important. Vaccine or no vaccine, we\u2019re back and we\u2019re starting the process and, in many cases, they don\u2019t have vaccines and a virus or a flu comes and you fight through it.\u201d</p> \n<p>Moncep Slaoui, a former chairman of vaccines at GlaxoSmithKline who will lead the multibillion-dollar program, expressed optimism that progress is being made.</p> \n<p>\u201cI have very recently seen early data from a clinical trial with a coronavirus vaccine,\u201d he said. \u201cThese data made me feel even more confident that we will be able to deliver a few hundred million doses of a vaccine by the end of 2020.\u201d</p> \n<p>Gustave Perna, a four-star general in charge of the army\u2019s logistics and supply chain operation, will be the chief operating officer.

With various states already reopening, Trump promised the US economy would roar back. And he insisted: \u201cI think the schools should be back in the fall.\u201d</p> \n<p>Asked if he has concerns about students or teachers bringing the virus home to their families, Trump replied: \u201cI\u2019m concerned about everything. And I\u2019m also concerned about our country. Our country has to get back.\u201d</p> \n<p>The shutdown itself causes depression, drug use, suicide and other problems that lead to death, he added. \u201cWe have a great plan to prevent the spread, but that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going to close our country for five years, OK?

A second privacy-focused amendment to the Patriot Act \u2013 one that garnered far less coverage but is potentially even more substantive \u2013 did pass overwhelmingly on Wednesday night. Because <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/13/senate-browsing-histories-fisa-254970\">the substance of the amendment was much harder to fit into a headline</a>, it received a fraction of the attention. But it may be because the vote on web browsing histories sparked immediate outrage on Twitter, politicians from both parties felt the need to accept it.</p> <p>The amendment, known as the Leahy-Lee amendment \u2013 named after its bipartisan co-sponsors Patrick Leahy and Mike Lee \u2013 reforms the secretive foreign intelligence surveillance (Fisa) court in a significant way. The Fisa court, which authorizes national security and foreign intelligence surveillance on US soil, first came to the general public\u2019s attention <a href=\"https://fas.org/blogs/secrecy/2013/09/snowden-fisc/\">during the Snowden disclosures</a>.</p> <p>The court, for decades, would listen to the government\u2019s side of an argument for new surveillance powers in complete secrecy, and almost never heard from the civil liberties perspective. The court was <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2013/06/13/191226106/fisa-court-appears-to-be-rubberstamp-for-government-requests\">known to rubber-stamp virtually anything the FBI or NSA asked for</a>. This one-sided system, as <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/07/us/in-secret-court-vastly-broadens-powers-of-nsa.html\">the New York Times reported at the time</a>, carved out classified exceptions to the fourth amendment and \u201ccreated a secret body of law giving the National Security Agency the power to amass vast collections of data on Americans\u201d without the public knowing about it.</p> <p>After the Snowden disclosures, Congress was forced to create an amicus curiae \u2013 or \u201cfriend of the court\u201d \u2013 position, which at very limited times and at the court\u2019s discretion, would be allowed to resist the government\u2019s arguments. Even though the position was extremely restricted, over the past several years,<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/08/us/politics/fbi-fisa-court.html\"> it has been shown to work</a> on the few occasions it\u2019s been used.</p> <p>The Leahy-Lee amendment significantly strengthens the amicus position, giving the court\u2019s civil liberties representative much more latitude to access classified information and broadens their ability to weigh in on virtually all cases that may infringe upon the civil liberties of Americans.</p> <p>And here\u2019s where it gets interesting. The House passed a different version of a Patriot Act extension back in March, so now the Senate\u2019s version has to go back to the House, so the bills can match up. It gives privacy advocates another opportunity to get through even more robust changes, like the Wyden amendment protecting our Google search data.</p> <p>This issue is not the same partisan fight that we have become so accustomed to in Washington. Instead of a Republican-Democrat split, like so many issues in recent years, the fight over privacy and the Patriot Act has pitted a bipartisan left-right coalition against the moderate, pro-national security state establishment of both parties. Many Republicans crossed the line to vote with the majority of Democrats, while 10 Democrats sided with Barr and the Trump administration to hand them this power.</p> <p>While it\u2019s incredibly depressing Congress has failed to protect online privacy as it has become this generation\u2019s seminal issue, the fight is not over. Especially if representatives hear loud and clear how much this issue means to Americans.</p> <ul> <li><p>Trevor Timm is executive director of the Freedom of the Press Foundation</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>Some people say it doesn\u2019t even exist \u2013 that it\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/16/business/worldbusiness/neoliberalism-it-doesnt-exist.html\">meaningless</a>\u201d, or even \u201ca term of abuse\u201d. But from the 2008 financial crisis to the vote for Brexit in 2016, from the rise of the alt-right to the Covid-19 pandemic, there is no way of properly grasping our world without thinking about how neoliberalism informs our politics and economy.</p> <p>But what is it? Broadly speaking, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/aug/18/neoliberalism-the-idea-that-changed-the-world\">neoliberalism</a> can be defined as the raft of policies and overarching political ethos that enabled governments in the late-1970s to turn away from state-directed economic planning, towards an economic model that extended competitive markets into every sphere of human activity and initiated the reign of finance capital (the kind dreamed up in the City of London and Wall Street) by removing constraints on capital mobility.</p> <p>Importantly, neoliberalism is not merely a policy agenda but also a moral framework that teaches individuals to conceive of themselves not as, say, wage earners but rather as risk-taking entrepreneurs who should expect to shoulder the financial risks of their participation in higher education, the credit system and deregulated labour markets.</p> <p>First implemented as an economic programme in the UK and the United States by the Thatcher government and the Reagan administration, its principles continued to underwrite the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/feb/10/labour.uk1\">third </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/feb/10/labour.uk1\">way</a> politics of New Labour and Clintonite Democrats. Although centre-left politicians reject the applicability of the term to their politics, a wealth of scholarship produced by economists, <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/246256989_From_Thatcherism_to_New_Labour_NeoLiberalism_Workfarism_and_Labour_Market_Regulation1\">sociologists</a> and historians demonstrates how third-way politicians <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/jan/18/blair-thatcher-legacy-labour-zarah-sultana\">advanced the neoliberal project</a>.</p> <p>So, where does the ideology stand today? Some are <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/transformation/coronavirus-spells-the-end-of-the-neoliberal-era-whats-next/\">calling time</a> on the neoliberal age. In the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, <a href=\"https://paulmason.substack.com/p/day-one-of-uks-suppression-strategy?fbclid=IwAR2IZCzgpr9-gw23yDNugVaJd6tN2E2xJ_B06S_ossyCrlHCwe4SZFSBRrU\">Paul Mason declared</a> that the exigencies of the crisis would mean that, in short order, the UK\u2019s political class would soon consist entirely of either \u201centhusiastic\u201d or \u201creluctant socialists\u201d \u2013 progressive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/17/governments-crisis-coronavirus-business\">state intervention</a> was inevitably back on the agenda. However, claims of this sort should be treated with caution, not least because similar predictions were made following the financial crisis, and after the Brexit vote and the election of Donald Trump as US president. And those predictions turned out to be seriously awry.</p> <p>For instance, at the height of the financial crisis, the Nobel prize-winning economist <a href=\"http://16beavergroup.org/articles/2008/10/24/infoshop-the-philosophies-of-deregulation-and-neoliberalism-are-dead-in-the-west/\">Joseph Stiglitz announced</a>, \u201cNeoliberalism \u2026 is dead.\u201d Yet it soon became abundantly clear that this was premature. It is true that the crisis seemed to pose a serious threat to the veneration of markets, as governments were forced to bail out the financial sector. But, as scholars such as <a href=\"https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2018/02/neoliberalism-movement-dare-not-speak-name/\">Philip Mirowski</a> have shown, neoliberals have long understood that their project requires state intervention to create and maintain markets. Rather than thinking of the crisis-fighting of governments in 2008 as a repudiation of market-friendly policy, it\u2019s more useful to think of it as an extreme instance of pro-business government intervention that aimed to maintain the long-term primacy of the market.</p> <p>On the face of it, the vote for Brexit and the election of Trump appeared to more <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/17/american-neoliberalism-cornel-west-2016-election\">plausibly represent a break</a> with neoliberalism. But that diagnosis arose from a failure to understand how neoliberalism can adaptively recombine with elements of other ideologies.</p> <p>While the Brexiteers may loathe the European Union (an institution that neoliberal intellectuals have <a href=\"https://braveneweurope.com/quinn-slobodian-and-dieter-plehwe-the-neoliberals-who-opposed-europe\">long disagreed about</a>) they remain committed to the core of neoliberal ideology. For example, the Australian points-based immigration system \u2013 so beloved by the Brexiteers \u2013 is perfectly congruent with the neoliberals\u2019 view of human beings as bundles of assets (of greater or lesser value). The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/19/the-post-brexit-immigration-plans-at-a-glance\">post-Brexit immigrant</a>\u2019s educational background, work experience and connections are redefined as forms of capital that may or may not be worth investing in (by letting them in) in order to secure a future return on that investment for the national economy. Points-based immigration systems, in other words, do not represent a straightforward shift away from neoliberal, free-market orthodoxy towards rightwing protectionism.</p> <p>If neither the crises of 2008 nor 2016 signalled the end of neoliberalism, what about Covid-19? Today, as in 2008, politicians such as Rishi Sunak have been forced to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/e77d3267-21f5-4369-bf08-0cf0f31ae3ff\">implement policies</a> that seem to contradict their adherence to market supremacy, but the intention is again to do so in order to swiftly return to \u201cnormal\u201d and wean the public off their \u201caddiction\u201d to state support. The government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/rishi-sunak-to-cut-coronavirus-furlough-scheme-cq2bfxl5p\">frustrated desire</a> to curtail the furlough scheme, and the clear opposition to implementing a universal basic income, indicate a commitment to maintaining the core of neoliberal welfare policy. This means opposing generous, non-means-tested payments, which neoliberals view as detrimental to fostering entrepreneurial activity and disciplining the workforce.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/12/uk-freeze-private-rents-homelessness-coronavirus-labour\">The UK must freeze private rents now \u2013 or thousands will be made homeless | Joe Beswick</a> </p> </aside>  <p>More disturbingly, in the context of pandemic and the climate crisis, the persistence of the neoliberal view of individuals as human capital raises the possibility of governments treating populations of \u201clow value\u201d as <a href=\"https://lpeblog.org/2020/04/27/nationalism-and-neoliberal-governance/#more-3508\">disposable</a>. Increased state intervention to protect incomes is welcome, but could be used by governments to implement a kind of economic triage, with populations deemed not worth \u201cbailing out\u201d excluded from state support. As <a href=\"http://www.fordhampress.com/9780823285723/mutant-neoliberalism/\">Michel Feher</a> has shown, there are milder precedents for this in welfare reforms carried out by mainstream political parties in Ireland and Portugal, which reduced benefits for younger cohorts in order to encourage emigration and, in the case of Portugal, to swap young, relatively poor Portuguese for wealthier retirees from abroad. In a context of ballooning national debt, where migrant populations are being treated as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/may/02/malaysia-cites-covid-19-for-rounding-up-hundreds-of-migrants\">vectors of disease</a>, it\u2019s not difficult to see how an exclusionary neoliberal politics that supports investment in certain populations and disinvestment in others could gain traction.</p> <p>All of this is not to deny that the Covid-19 crisis poses a real threat to neoliberal orthodoxy. Physical distancing and enforced quarantine have <a href=\"https://novaramedia.com/2020/04/27/dont-fight-the-last-war-why-the-left-needs-to-look-beyond-austerity/\">disrupted the labour market</a>, potentially shifting the balance of power between labour and capital in favour of workers.

And the furlough scheme has temporarily revealed the artificiality of government spending constraints. But given the persistence and adaptability of neoliberal ideology over the past 10 years, any sober assessment of the current situation needs to be attuned to the possibility of its survival (or successful mutation), as well as its possible demise.</p> <p>\u2022 Alex Doherty is the host of the Politics Theory Other podcast</p>",
