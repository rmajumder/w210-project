  "<p>On Friday, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/23/us/politics/coronavirus-trump.html\">the New York Times </a> accused Donald Trump of spending time eating fries and watching TV during the pandemic, sometimes not arriving at the Oval Office until noon. As a response, multiple White House officials were rolled out to confirm Trump was working non-stop, <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2020/04/26/trump-works-so-hard-he-often-misses-lunch-white-house-officials/\">so much so that the president sometimes misses his lunch</a>.</p> <p>Let\u2019s make clear that this is not meant to cast shade on lunch-takers. Quite the contrary: taking lunch is as much a measure of how hard one works as a man\u2019s shoe size is a measure of how big his ego is.</p> <p>But Trump\u2019s \u201cproof\u201d of his hard work is a bit surprising. Almost a third of US workers don\u2019t <a href=\"http://rh-us.mediaroom.com/2018-09-10-More-Than-Half-Of-Workers-Take-30-Minutes-Or-Less-For-Lunch-Survey-Says\">get to take a lunch</a><a href=\"http://rh-us.mediaroom.com/2018-09-10-More-Than-Half-Of-Workers-Take-30-Minutes-Or-Less-For-Lunch-Survey-Says\"> break</a>\u2013 and those are just ordinary people, the ones who homeschool their children while working from home if they\u2019re lucky enough to have a paycheck, with a salary to reflect that.</p> <p>Unfortunately for Trump, his routine pales in comparison to other famous leaders\u2019 schedules. Margaret Thatcher was memorably said to have slept just four hours a night, while <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-42610275\">George W Bush reportedly arrived at the White House at 6.45am</a>. <a href=\"https://dailyroutines.typepad.com/daily_routines/2009/02/winston-churchill.html\">Winston Churchill reportedly did a day and a half\u2019s work</a> in 24 hours during the second world war, but littered among his working day were multiple naps, cocktails, board games and a few decadent meals. If his diary proves anything, it\u2019s that productive people can take a lunch break and still manage to get things done.</p> <p>As for Trump, there is no way of proving whether he takes his lunch, nor is it possible to measure his productivity from afar. But it\u2019s worth considering that he might be able to take a lunch break if he congratulated himself less.</p> <p>How much time would he save, you ask? Well, roughly <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/26/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-briefings-analyzed.html\">however long it takes to say 260,000 words</a> \u2013 and that\u2019s just during press briefings. If he quit the self-compliments altogether, he might even have time to start taking naps. <br></p>",

To defend himself against criticism of his handling of the outbreak, Trump has repeatedly pointed to a January decision to impose restrictions on travel from China, which he says impeded the virus\u2019s spread in the US.</p> <p>The aggressive push to reframe the election suggests that there is more to be gained by attacking Biden than promoting the president\u2019s leadership during the pandemic.</p> <p>A 57-page attack <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/24/gop-memo-anti-china-coronavirus-207244\">memo</a>, obtained by Politico, advised Republican candidates to blame China when asked whether the spread of the virus is Trump\u2019s fault. \u201cDon\u2019t defend Trump, other than the China Travel Ban \u2013 attack China,\u201d it states. </p> <p>Negatively defining a political opponent early in the campaign is a time-honored tactic, employed by Barack Obama against Mitt Romney in 2012 and by George W Bush against John Kerry in 2004. But it is harder to execute against a well-known former vice-president with a long established brand as a folksy pragmatist.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the time to really set the tone and the narrative,\u201d said Sam Nunberg, a former Trump campaign adviser. \u201cNow is the time to sell the message to voters that Joe Biden is not the blue-collar, moderate from Scranton, Pennsylvania, who Barack Obama put on the ticket. This is not the Joe Biden you used to know.\u201d</p> <p>Nunberg said China is only one front in the personal assault on Biden. Tying him to his former leftist rival Sanders and questioning his mental fitness are seen as equally damaging themes, he said.</p> <p>Indeed, Trump and his allies continue to gleefully mock Biden\u2019s verbal miscues, amplifying them \u2013 some deceptively edited or altered \u2013 to affirm their charge that the 77-year-old has \u201clost his fastball\u201d. And while Trump encourages Sanders\u2019 supporters to join his own campaign, Republicans continue to press the case that Biden, perhaps the most moderate of all the Democrats who ran for president, has embraced the senator\u2019s Democratic socialist agenda. </p> <p>\u201cWhen faced with the choice of President Trump\u2019s record of accomplishment or Biden\u2019s weak record on China and far-left agenda, the choice for voters is clear,\u201d Sarah Matthews, deputy press secretary for the Trump campaign, said in a statement.</p> <p>But a China-centered strategy is risky, complicated in no small part by Trump\u2019s own rhetoric.</p> <p>Though Trump ran for the White House four years ago on a promise to \u201cget tough\u201d on China, he has struck a different posture as president in pursuit of a \u201cbig, beautiful\u201d trade deal with the world\u2019s second-largest economy. In recent months, he lavished praise on China\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, and <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/15/trump-china-coronavirus-188736\">echoed</a> Beijing\u2019s assertions that it had the virus under control, even as it spread around the world.</p> <p>The focus also invites deeper scrutiny of Trump\u2019s own business dealings in the country. On Friday, Politico <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/24/donald-trump-bank-of-china-debt-report\">reported </a>Trump borrowed tens of millions of dollars from the state-owned Bank of China for his share in a New York property development.</p> <p>Democrats, incredulous that Trump would try to claim the upper hand on China, welcomed it as an opportunity to assail his handling of the crisis.</p> <p>On a press call organized by the Democratic National Committee, the Michigan congresswoman Debbie Dingell accused Trump of failing to hold China accountable and for understating the early threat from the virus.</p> <p>\u201cHis chaotic federal response delayed mitigation efforts for weeks,\u201d Dingell, a Democrat whose state is among the hardest hit in the country, said on Thursday. His actions have caused confusion and misinformation to spread, and it\u2019s made it really hard for our governors and local leaders who are trying to do everything they can.\u201d</p> <p>The escalating war of words over who is tougher on China was amplified in competing campaign commercials.</p> <p>The Trump\u2019s campaign released an ad earlier this month lashing Biden over his past remarks on China and reprising unfounded corruption accusations against the former vice-president and his son.</p> <p>The message was amplified in an ad from America First, a Super Pac supporting Trump, which declares that \u201cfor 40 years Joe Biden has been wrong about China.\u201d The group also launched a standalone website, BeijingBiden.com, populated with content related to Biden\u2019s purported \u201ccozy relationship with China\u201d.</p> <p>The Biden campaign responded with a blistering ad of its own. The commercial blames Trump for not holding China to account earlier over its handling of the virus, saying the president \u201cfailed to act\u201d as the coronavirus spread. The Democratic Super Pac American Bridge is also running ads on the same theme, featuring footage of Trump praising Xi and saying that the president \u201cgave China his trust\u201d.</p> <p>Yet the Trump campaign was targeting Biden long before the race narrowed to a one-on-one contest.</p> <p>As Biden competed for the nomination, the Trump campaign, with its vast war chest, deployed advertising campaigns against him while attempting to foment discord among Democrats. And Trump was ultimately impeached over his efforts to pressure Ukraine to open investigations into Biden and his family.</p> <p>Though Trump rarely pays a political price for taking differing or contradictory positions on an issue, the new push comes as Trump\u2019s support in key battleground states <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-battlegrounds-exclusive/exclusive-poll-signals-strengthening-support-for-biden-over-trump-in-three-midwest-battleground-states-idUSKCN2243KJ\">wanes</a>. </p> <p>Trump\u2019s critics hold out faint hope that the election will bring a political reckoning over what they view as his staggering mismanagement of the coronavirus crisis.</p> <p>\u201cAll re-election campaigns \u2013 every single one of them \u2013 are a referendum on the incumbent,\u201d said Rick Wilson, co-founder of the Lincoln Project, a Republican-led effort to defeat Trump.</p> <p>\u201cAnd if Donald Trump had come into this election with peace and prosperity, it would be a very high hill to climb to defeat him. But he\u2019s not. He is coming into this with plague and depression.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Don\u2019t drink bleach. Don\u2019t jack up Dettol. When people have to be told that this is not a good idea \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/24/trump-disinfectant-bleach-coronavirus-claims-reaction\">even though their </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/24/trump-disinfectant-bleach-coronavirus-claims-reaction\">president has floated it</a> \u2013 we are definitely not in Kansas any more. Or maybe we are. At a protest where people equate physical distancing with communism.</p> <p>To be fair, Donald Trump did add the helpful caveat: \u201cI\u2019m not a doctor. But I\u2019m, like, a person that has a good you-know-what,\u201d while pointing at his head.</p> <p>Yeah, whatever. He should win the \u201cNoble prize\u201d, as he calls it, for his \u201cyou-know-what\u201d. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/trump-disinfectant-bleach-sarcastic\">He later claimed the disinfectant comments were sarcastic</a> and stopped his press briefings. It was reported that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/25/donald-trump-coronavirus-disinfectant-sarcastic-tipping-point\">he may have reached \u201ca tipping point\u201d</a> with his advisers. But surely we know by now that, with Trump, there is no tipping point. After <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/02/donald-trump-racist-claims-mexico-rapes\">calling Mexicans rapists</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/07/donald-trump-leaked-recording-women\">boasting about \u201cpussy grabbing\u201d</a>, his parade of bile and ignorance seems limitless.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know how many psychological profiles I have read of him in which he is diagnosed as a malignant narcissist, or it is suggested he has a cognitive impairment, or suffers from delusional thinking or a sociopathic inability to experience basic empathy. Yada yada yada. None of it matters. He promised an end to \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d, but that is exactly what he is presiding over.</p> <p>Analysing his psyche is not an act of opposition. Trump could not operate without all those around him, especially the support of the Republican party.</p> <p>Dr Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, finds the briefings he has to do with Trump \u201cdraining\u201d. No wonder, as he talks passionately about physical distancing while Trump contradicts him. Dr Deborah Birx, Trump\u2019s coronavirus response coordinator, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/26/coronavirus-birx-trump-disinfectant-remarks\">recently stood there looking alarmed while Trump riffed on disinfectant</a>. Vice-President Mike Pence looks on, zombified. It is only now that US media has begun to argue with him.</p> <p>He carries on, vilified, a laughing stock, a pathetic mobster, but with the support of the rightwing establishment. Focusing on his latest lunacy is entertainment. How the Republican party keeps him in power is the issue, for it is they who enable him. The tipping point will be reached when they decide to take him down.</p> <ul> <li><p>Suzanne Moore is a Guardian columnist</p></li> </ul>",
