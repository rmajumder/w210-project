This had fuelled reports that Trump is set to shift focus and appoint an economic taskforce.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is beyond economic,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI call it the \u2018opening our country taskforce\u2019 or \u2018opening our country council\u2019 so we don\u2019t get it confused with Mike\u2019s [Pence] taskforce, which has done so great.</p> \n<p>\u201cAnd we\u2019re going to have the great business leaders, the great doctors, we\u2019re going to have a group of people. We\u2019ll probably do it by teleconference because we don\u2019t really want them travelling in for their own purposes. I don\u2019t think it would look good, also.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump added: \u201cI want to get it open as soon as possible. This country was meant to be open and vibrant and great \u2026 The facts are going to determine what I do. But we do want to get the country open.\u201d</p> \n<p>He promised the council will be announced on Tuesday \u201cwith names that you have a lot of respect for, a lot of great names, different businesses, different people \u2026 I want their views on what they think\u201d.</p> \n<p>Media reports suggest the council could include his daughter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ivanka-trump\">Ivanka Trump</a>; the treasury secretary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/18/steven-mnuchin-coronavirus-unemployment-treasury-secretary\">Steven Mnuchin</a>; and the new White House chief of staff, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/06/trump-chief-of-staff-white-house-mark-meadows\">Mark Meadows</a>.</p> \n<p>The current \u201cstop the spread\u201d federal guidelines finish on 30 April and pressure is building on Trump to reopen at least parts of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/useconomy\">economy</a>, which has gone into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/09/us-unemployment-filings-coronavirus\">free fall</a> and shed more jobs than in the 2008-09 Great Recession. But with infections approaching half a million, public health experts fear that pushing too soon could result in a second wave of cases.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/totals\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>America has tested less than 1% of its population, leaving it way behind other nations on testing per capita, yet Trump dismissed questions on this issue.</p> \n<p>Dr Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, cautioned on Friday: \u201cWe\u2019re starting to see the levelling off \u2026 but it\u2019s important to remember that this is not the time to feel that since we have made such an important advance in the sense of success of the mitigation that we need to be pulling back at all.\u201d</p> \n<p>Dr Deborah Birx, the response coordinator, added that as encouraging as the signs are, \u201cwe have not reached the peak, and so every day we need to continue to do what we did yesterday and the week before and the week before that, because that\u2019s what, in the end, is going to take us up across the peak and down the other side\u201d.</p> \n<p>Trump promised to heed the experts. \u201cI listen to them about everything,\u201d he said. \u201cI think they\u2019re actually surprised. I have great respect for these people \u2026 We\u2019re not doing anything until we know that this country is going be healthy. We don\u2019t want to go back and start doing it over again.\u201d</p> \n<p>He acknowledged: \u201cI don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve had a bigger decision. But I\u2019m going to surround myself with the greatest minds. Not only the greatest minds, but the greatest minds in numerous different businesses, including the business of politics and reason.\u201d</p> \n<p>A reporter asked what metrics would be used to help Trump decide. He pointed to his head. Later he added: \u201cI have a big decision coming up, and I only hope to God that\u2019s it\u2019s the right decision.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s bombastic TV briefings have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/24/donald-trump-coronavirus-briefings-2020-campaign-rallies\">compared to campaign rallies</a> but normally supportive sources such as the South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham and the Wall Street Journal newspaper have warned that they are doing him more harm than good.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/24/donald-trump-coronavirus-briefings-2020-campaign-rallies\">Are Trump's coronavirus briefings the new 2020 campaign rallies?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Perhaps stung, he reshuffled the order of speakers on Friday and adopted a more genial tone. \u201cOK, it\u2019s Good Friday so let\u2019s be nice,\u201d Trump said as he invited questions.</p> \n<p>But he could not resist sparring with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/cnn\">CNN</a>\u2019s Jim Acosta, an old foe, who asked: \u201cWe hear from a lot of people who see these briefings as sort of \u2018happy talk\u2019 briefings. And some of the officials paint as rosy a picture of what is happening around the country. If you look at some of these questions \u2013 do we have enough masks? No. Do we have enough tests? No. Do we have enough PPE? No.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump snapped: \u201cA lot of it is fake news \u2026 This is not happy talk. Maybe it is happy talk for you. It is not happy talk for me. We\u2019re talking about the greatest economy in the world, one day I have to close it off. And we did the right thing because maybe it would have been 2 million people died.\u201d</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cThis is sad talk \u2026 These are the saddest news conferences that I have ever had. I don\u2019t like doing them. You know why? Because I am talking about death.\u201d</p>",

Its magazine-y format allows it to bob back and forth between serious and trivial cases, a spot of audience interaction and a sense of warmth emanating from the host. Comedian Lycett has a fairly retro vibe, with a soft campness, a genuine but never scathing wit and a willingness to engage seriously with his subject when required, primarily during the larger-scale set piece around which each episode is structured.</p> <p>In the first, this main subject is the changing of his name by deed poll to Hugo Boss in order to draw the ire of the clothing company and highlight its heavyhanded approach to protecting its intellectual property. Hugo Boss (the company, not the artist formerly known as Joe Lycett) recently sent a cease and desist letter to a tiny Welsh company called Boss Brewing \u2013 so we are literally talking small beer \u2013 over the use of the word \u201cBoss\u201d in its branding. After spending \u00a310,000 on legal fees, the little guys had to give up the fight and spend another \u00a315,000 or so renaming products that anyone with a modicum of sense instead of a barrelful of corporate malevolence could see are no threat whatsoever to the fashion conglomerate.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6Sb9PIXO14\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/N6Sb9PIXO14?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The programme hammered home the unfairness by recapping all the pre-show media coverage the pointed prank had garnered, and holding a launch party for the wrist support bandage newly produced by Hugo Boss (this time indeed the artist formerly known as Joe Lycett) outside the other\u2019s flagship London store. If it didn\u2019t result in a restoration of the Boss Brewing fortunes, it at least brought them some good publicity and made sure the original Hugo Boss name is mud.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/apr/04/ive-had-to-sleep-with-the-entire-legal-team-joe-lycett-on-making-tvs-most-risk-taking-comedy\">\u2018I\u2019ve had to sleep with the entire legal team\u2019: Joe Lycett on making TV's most risk-taking comedy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Elsewhere, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jul/03/katherine-ryan-interview-comedy-single-mum-glitter-room\">Katherine Ryan</a> lent her deadpan support to the righting of more minor wrongs, including the growing phenomenon of agencies that have sprung up to offer would-be online media influencers the chance \u2013 for a price \u2013 to get invited to all the right parties, connect with brands and set themselves on the path to a lucrative career.

  "<h2>Could the November election be delayed due to coronavirus?</h2> <p>The presidential vote is due to take place on 3 November. The date is set by federal law and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a> has no power to delay it alone. That would require legislation enacted by Congress and signed by the president. Such an outcome still remains unthinkable to most. But many unthinkable events have unfolded recently.</p> <h2>Is Joe Biden the Democratic presidential nominee?</h2> <p>This week, the Vermont senator and democratic socialist Bernie Sanders <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/08/bernie-sanders-ends-2020-presidential-race\">suspended his campaign for president</a>, saying he couldn\u2019t see a path to the nomination. Sanders, who reshaped American politics with his youth-led movement for sweeping social change, was Biden\u2019s last rival in the field, which leaves the former vice-president, under Barack Obama, as the de facto Democratic candidate to challenge Trump.</p> <h2>Will Democratic primary elections still take place?</h2> <p>Despite the pandemic and the fact that the Democrats already have a de facto nominee, many states have not had their chance to cast their ballots. This week, despite widespread criticism and some late efforts by the governor to stop it, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/07/wisconsin-votes-controversial-election-coronavirus-us-election-2020\">Wisconsin still held in-person voting</a> in its primary, but most other states yet to vote have delayed theirs until June.</p> <h2>Why is Sanders staying on the Democratic primary ballot?</h2> <p>When Sanders suspended his campaign this week, he made it clear that <a href=\"https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/03/9540304/joe-biden-wins-bernie-sanders-women-voters\">he viewed Biden</a> as the party\u2019s de facto nominee. But that doesn\u2019t mean that Biden is automatically the official Democratic candidate \u2013 he still <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/22/us/politics/democratic-primary-dnc-superdelegates.html\">has to receive the party\u2019s nomination</a>, which happens at the Democratic national convention (now delayed from July to August). If Biden secures 1,991 pledged delegates at the DNC, which now seems likely, he will be the official nominee. Sanders has said he will stay on the ballot in states that are yet to hold their primaries, to continue to exert the influence of his leftist movement on the 2020 Democratic policy platform.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/10/trump-poll-numbers-dip-handling-coronavirus\">Trump's poll numbers dip over handling of coronavirus pandemic</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>How will the conventions work?</h2> <p>The Democratic national convention, where Biden, 77, is expected to be officially nominated as the party\u2019s presidential candidate, was due to be held in July in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, which, like most other US cities, is grappling with coronavirus. It has been delayed to August, a week before the Republican national convention, when Trump, then 74 years old, will be officially named his party\u2019s nominee after facing no serious challengers.</p> <h2>Will campaigning continue?</h2> <p>Media coverage that would normally be all about the race for the White House is dominated instead by an extraordinary public health and economic crisis, with the US <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/04/01/coronavirus-latest-news/\">death toll from the virus expected to</a> be in the tens of thousands. Trump and Biden continue to work on the assumption that, come November, the worst of the pandemic will be over. The US held <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/21/us/politics/1918-flu-pandemic-elections.html\">midterm elections in 1918</a> even in the grip of the Spanish flu that killed 675,000 people nationwide. Meanwhile, the president controversially uses the daily White House coronavirus taskforce briefings to push his own political agenda, and Biden has been campaigning from home in Delaware, hoping to use a new digital strategy that includes a podcast to reach voters.</p> <h2>Could the election be carried out by vote-by-mail?</h2> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re in completely uncharted waters here and I don\u2019t think anybody knows what\u2019s going to happen,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.fordham.edu/info/24277/ma_in_elections_and_campaign_management_faculty/6866/monika_l_mcdermott\">Monika McDermott</a>, a political science professor at Fordham University in New York, recently told the Guardian. \u201cBy November the picture might be completely unrecognisable. We don\u2019t even know if the election is going to happen as scheduled. There\u2019s talk out there about postponing it or changing it to a mail-in-only election.\u201d</p> <p>If the election does go ahead as expected on 3 November, states that already allow early and absentee voting will be well placed. Washington state, for example, has carried out elections by mail for years and its primary last month went ahead as planned. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/paloma/the-trailer/2020/04/02/the-trailer-the-fear-and-politics-around-expanding-voting-by-mail/5e84980e602ff10d49ada414/\">But 17 states require some kind of excuse</a> for requesting an absentee ballot. Many would need to change their rules at huge cost to run a mail-only election.</p> <h2>What happens if a candidate becomes incapacitated?</h2> <p>If the president\u2019s cabinet and Congress agree the president is incapacitated, the 25th amendment to the US constitution states that the vice-president becomes acting president.</p> <p>No presidential candidate has ever died or become incapacitated between their nomination and the election. The procedures to replace a candidate are guided by federal and state laws and party regulations, but the situation would be unprecedented.</p>",
  "<p>Support for Donald Trump\u2019s handling of the coronavirus has plunged over the past week, polls show, as some of his advisers and Republican allies are said to be concerned over the US president\u2019s daily briefings on the pandemic.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/10/coronavirus-live-news-global-deaths-near-95000-as-boris-johnson-leaves-intensive-care\">Coronavirus live news: worldwide Covid-19 death toll passes 100,000</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trump experienced an upturn in public support as the virus hit the US, and his job approval rating surged to almost the highest rating since he was elected.

Trump\u2019s overall approval rating was at 40%, close to where it has been for much of his presidency. According to a survey by CNN, 45% of Americans approve of Trump\u2019s coronavirus response.</p> <p>Perhaps more worrying for Trump are his dwindling numbers in a match-up against Joe Biden. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/09/politics/cnn-poll-biden-trump/index.html\">CNN found that Biden leads Trump</a> 53% to 42% among registered voters nationwide.</p> <p>A number of Trump\u2019s advisers and Republican allies are said to be among those unimpressed with his performance at his press briefings, which have become a daily ritual and often last several hours. <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/donald-trump-coronavirus-recovery-republicans-2020-3b161514-053c-480f-99ca-0c8ad142e98c.html\">Axios</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-press-briefing.html\">the New York Times</a> reported that a series of senior figures have become dismayed at the briefings, which Trump has used to propagate lies and disinformation about his response to the pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cWhite House allies and Republican lawmakers increasingly believe the briefings are hurting the president more than helping him,\u201d the Times reported.</p> <p>Even the Trump loyalist Lindsey Graham is among those who wants Trump to rein in his briefings, which frequently run on for more than an hour and regularly feature an upset president lashing out at the press.</p> <p>Graham told the New York Times that Trump \u201csometimes drowns out his own message\u201d, and said he had counseled the president to limit the briefings to once a week. Axios reported that Republicans are worried the rambling performances, along with the White House\u2019s wider response to the coronavirus, could harm Trump\u2019s re-election chances.</p> <p>\u201cThe next 4-8 weeks is really going to decide whether Trump gets re-elected,\u201d Stephen Moore, a former Trump nominee for Federal Reserve, <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/donald-trump-coronavirus-recovery-republicans-2020-3b161514-053c-480f-99ca-0c8ad142e98c.html\">told Axios</a>.</p> <p>The normally forgiving editorial board of the conservative Wall Street Journal has also come out against Trump\u2019s daily presentations.</p> <p>\u201cThe briefings began as a good idea to educate the public about the dangers of the virus, how Americans should change their behavior, and what the government is doing to combat it,\u201d the Journal wrote. \u201cBut sometime in the last three weeks Mr Trump seems to have concluded that the briefings could be a showcase for him.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the pleas, it seems unlikely that Trump, who is increasingly using the briefings to push out the kind of messaging usually reserved for his campaign rallies, will put a halt to them any time soon.</p> <p>\u201cAny suggestion that President Trump is struggling on tone or message is completely false,\u201d the White House spokesman Judd Deere told the New York Times.</p>",
  "<p>If any lingering doubts remained, Tuesday should have erased them all. Republicans will weaponize anything \u2013 even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/07/wisconsin-votes-controversial-election-coronavirus-us-election-2020\">in-person voting</a> during a deadly pandemic \u2013 to maintain power, avoid accountability and bend electoral rules in their favor. Worse, the US supreme court will have their back.</p> <p>Make no mistake: the deliberate chaos and unthinkable images from Wisconsin on Tuesday \u2013 Americans on line for hours, wearing homemade masks, risking a gruesome respiratory disease to exercise their right to vote \u2013 wasn\u2019t just a warning sign for November\u2019s elections. It was Republicans\u2019 dress rehearsal.</p> <p>It\u2019s scarcely 200 days until the real show. The coronavirus has already pushed more than a dozen states to postpone primaries and forced fearful Ohio and Wisconsin governors into court the day before an election, desperate to avoid worsening a public health crisis. It\u2019s quite likely that the virus will threaten in-person voting in many states and cities in November as well.</p> <p>That\u2019s why a growing non-partisan chorus has called for expanding vote-by-mail options this fall. It can be done; five states already conduct all their elections this way and every state allows some level of mail-in voting. It doesn\u2019t favor either party \u2013 just ask Republicans in Utah and Colorado. It\u2019s safer during a pandemic, but also secure: <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/5/23/17383400/vote-by-mail-home-california-alaska-nebraska\">a study</a> of hundreds of millions of votes in Oregon, ever since it became the first to adopt all-mail elections, found fewer than 15 fraudulent ballots cast over more than a decade.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Nothing about the Wisconsin election was normal</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Republicans, however, have fought efforts to fund expanded voting options this fall. President Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/30/trump-republican-party-voting-reform-coronavirus\">recently told</a> Fox &amp; Friends: \u201cIf you\u2019d ever agreed to it, you\u2019d never have a Republican elected in this country again.\u201d On Wednesday, he tweeted that vote by mail creates \u201ctremendous potential\u201d for voter fraud and mused that \u201cfor whatever reason, [it] doesn\u2019t work out well for Republicans\u201d. Georgia\u2019s state house speaker knows that reason, opposing it because it \u201cwill certainly drive up turnout\u201d and \u201cwill be extremely devastating to Republicans and conservatives\u201d.</p> <p>But while the quiet part sometimes comes out louder than expected, most of the Republican party\u2019s anti-vote-by-mail excuses are ludicrous. If the president\u2019s intention is to conjure phoney visions of voter fraud, others hope to simply slow-walk reform. When Senate Democrats attempted to add election protection safeguards to the first coronavirus stimulus package, the Republican senator John Barrasso <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2020/03/24/senate-section/article/S1976-3\">insisted</a> they \u201chave no place in an emergency rescue package for the American people\u201d.

When Robin Vos, Wisconsin\u2019s Republican assembly speaker, tried to deny it, he wore a mask and full personal protective gear. He looked like one of those mean government agents looking to capture ET, which only undercut his assurances that voters stacked up in the five available Milwaukee precincts had absolutely nothing to fear.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/people-are-going-to-die-in-this-election-wisconsin-votes-amid-coronavirus-pandemic-1\">Nothing</a> about the Wisconsin election was normal. Not voters in homemade masks, not the immunocompromised woman whose requested absentee ballot never arrived voting in full bubble wrap, not the plaintive signs that read \u201cthis is ridiculous\u201d. But the five conservative Republican appointees to the US supreme court, <a href=\"\u201cfundamentally%20alter%20the%20nature%20of%20the%20election\u201d\">concerned</a>, ruefully and almost comically, that something might \u201cfundamentally alter the nature of the election\u201d, stepped in \u2026 on the side of forcing tens of thousands of Wisconsinites to brave the pandemic and vote in person.</p> <p>Along a dreary 5-4 party line vote, the supreme court\u2019s conservative majority, most appointed by presidents who lost the popular vote, overturned two lower-court rulings that had extended the vote-by-mail deadline until next week, despite evidence that tens of thousands of absentee ballots had yet to be delivered to voters who requested them, and that untold thousands more might not be postmarked in time. Ruling comfortably from their own living rooms, the five conservatives required these voters to leave their homes during a shelter-in-place order and placed them in the path of a virus. (On Wednesday, the day after the election, reports came of absentee ballots piled in post offices, undelivered.)</p> <p>That the supreme court intervened not on the side of voters and fair elections, but in order to protect particular Republican partisan interests, should be saddening, yet unsurprising. Chief Justice John Roberts arrived in Washington almost 30 years ago as a young justice department appointee with a particular interest: eroding the protections of the Voting Rights Act (VRA). Under his leadership, this court has embraced his cramped vision with gusto.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ba346222d338b382cb9711af8f23a217b6996860\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ba346222d338b382cb9711af8f23a217b6996860/0_0_4413_2648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Roberts arrived in Washington almost 30 years ago as a young justice department appointee with a particular interest: eroding the protections of the Voting Rights Act.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Roberts arrived in Washington almost 30 years ago as a young justice department appointee with a particular interest: eroding the protections of the Voting Rights Act.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mario Tama/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Roberts court has made clear that it should not be looked to as any guarantor of the foundational right to vote. Not in an emergency. Not at all. In 2013\u2019s Shelby County v Holder, a 5-4 court defanged the enforcement provisions of section V of the VRA and laid the groundwork for a decade of voter ID requirements, precinct closures and voter roll purges from states with documented histories of racist voting inequities.</p> <p>The legislatures behind those efforts, a 5-4 court decreed in 2018\u2019s Abbott v Texas, must be awarded the \u201cpresumption of good faith\u201d \u2013 even for naked racial gerrymandering schemes. Those voter roll purges were upheld in 2018\u2019s Husted v A Philip Randolph Institute, where the court, again 5-4, created a non-existent loophole that justified canceling registrations if a voter had not casted a ballot in two consecutive elections. Then last year, Roberts authored a, yes, 5-4 decision \u2013 Common Cause v Rucho \u2013 which slammed the federal courthouses closed to partisan gerrymandering claims at precisely the time a growing number of decisions, by judges appointed by presidents of both parties, saw both an urgent role for the courts and a clear standard for when politicized mapmaking crossed a constitutional boundary.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Elected Republican officials have proven that they are willing to see Americans die rather than hold fair elections</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Gerrymandering and voter purges were at the heart of the GOP urgency to hold this election, this week, with this diminished turnout. A critical state supreme court seat was on the ballot. The winner could sway an upcoming appeal over whether <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/06/wisconsin-voter-purges-black-student-populations-risk\">Wisconsin can purge</a> about 240,000 voters from its rolls ahead of November \u2013 keep in mind, Trump only won this state by 22,000 votes in 2016 \u2013 and could also determine whether Republicans, once again, have a free hand to gerrymander the state\u2019s legislative and congressional maps in 2021. The maps the party carefully engineered in 2011, behind closed doors at a Madison law firm, delivered a 63-36 Republican edge among state assembly districts in 2018, even though Democrats won nearly 54% of the statewide vote, and a statewide edge of about 200,000 votes.</p> <p>Non-partisan electoral reformers, Democratic congressional leadership, and even some apostate Republicans like Bill Kristol and the former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele have been battling to ensure that November\u2019s election doesn\u2019t look like the one this week in Wisconsin. After all, even if Congress does nothing to create a national vote-by-mail standard, there\u2019s still likely to be record demand for absentee ballots this fall. And just as the underfunded election administrators and US Postal Service were overwhelmed by an unprecedented 1.2m requests in Wisconsin, it\u2019s easy to imagine a creaky system collapsing under similar strains in November.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/08/wisconsin-coronavirus-black-communities-inequality\">Wisconsin's primary subjected people of color to yet another Covid-19 disadvantage | David Bowen</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Republican strategy is clear: drag their feet so it\u2019s difficult to properly fund vote-by-mail.

That\u2019s a frightening sentence to write. But it\u2019s long past time we call this what it is: elected Republican officials, and the conservatives who they have handed lifelong tenure on the federal bench, have now proven that they are willing to see Americans die rather than hold fair elections that might oust them from power.

  "<p>The rise of Peter Navarro \u2013 the man put in charge of marshalling emergency US production of medical equipment in the midst of a pandemic \u2013 is in many ways a classic story of the Trump era.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/mar/11/peter-navarro-the-economist-shaping-trumps-economic-thinking\">Peter Navarro: the economist shaping Trump's economic thinking</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The 70-year-old White House trade adviser was first recruited by Trump because he wrote a string of books about the Chinese strategic threat \u2013 one called <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Death-China-Confronting-Dragon-paperback/dp/0134319036\">Death by China</a> \u2013 despite having spent almost no time in the country and having no grasp of the language.</p> <p>Five of Navarro\u2019s books cited a China hand with a particularly pithy turn of phrase called Ron Vara, who turned out not to exist. The name is an anagram of Navarro and the imaginary expert operated as an alter ego, confirming the author\u2019s views.</p> <p>Navarro made headlines in the past week by challenging Dr Anthony Fauci \u2013 the nation\u2019s leading immunologist and the public face of the US scientific community\u2019s race to contain Covid-19 \u2013 in a <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/coronavirus-hydroxychloroquine-white-house-01306286-0bbc-4042-9bfe-890413c6220d.html\">showdown</a> in the White House situation room over the merits of an experimental drug.</p> <p>When asked later why he thought he was qualified to start recommending pharmaceuticals to the nation, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/06/politics/peter-navarro-social-scientist-cnntv/index.html\">Navarro replied</a>: \u201cMy qualifications in terms of looking at the science is that I\u2019m a social scientist. I have a PhD. And I understand how to read statistical studies, whether it\u2019s in medicine, the law, economics or whatever.\u201d</p> <p>People who have worked closely with Navarro agree he is undoubtedly bright. He holds a PhD in economics from Harvard. But there is nothing in his career to date that suggests he has the credentials or experience to manage the state intervention necessary to steer US industry towards producing the masks, gowns, ventilators and other life-saving supplies the country will need over the course of this pandemic.</p> <p>Before coming to the White House, Navarro was a west coast academic economist with views on trade far outside the American mainstream and a failed political career behind him, have lost five elections and won none in his adoptive home town of San Diego.</p> <p>His former campaign adviser, Larry Remer, said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t trust him to go out to get lunch and come back with everybody\u2019s sandwich and drink order correctly. I don\u2019t know how he could be put in charge of logistics.</p> <p>\u201cOn one level it\u2019s amusing but on another level, it\u2019s really dangerous,\u201d added Remer, a San Diego political consultant.</p> <p>Navarro\u2019s appearance in the Trump camp during the 2016 presidential campaign came as a shock to those who knew him from his days in San Diego politics. He had started out as a registered Republican but became an anti-growth, environmentalist independent, then a Democratic candidate for Congress in 1996, promoted energetically but unsuccessfully by Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>Navarro came closest to victory in 1992 when he emerged as the surprise contender to be San Diego mayor, taking on the city\u2019s entrenched Republican establishment. He stood as an independent, with a working-class background, determined to stand up for the little guy in the face of rampant development. He called his movement Plan (Prevent Los Angelization Now) and he appeared to have a good chance of winning going into a final television debate a couple of days before the vote.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"638003cb287f3fda0c4ffcbbce46f6bc1d502960\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/638003cb287f3fda0c4ffcbbce46f6bc1d502960/0_122_3648_2189/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peter Navarro walks past reporters on the driveway outside the West Wing of the White House in Washington, DC, USA, 26 March 2020.

Trump has said he has no recollection of seeing the memo but the White House Cassandra has since emerged looking adept by comparison to the blithe counsel of treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, and the president\u2019s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.</p> <p>Navarro, the environmental activist turned China hawk, now has one of the most important jobs in the country as the coronavirus pandemic strengthen its grip.

  "<p>William Barr has said without evidence that he believes the Russia investigation that shadowed Donald Trump for the first two years of his administration was started without any basis and amounted to an effort to \u201csabotage the presidency\u201d, he said in an interview with Fox News Channel that aired on Thursday.</p> <p>The attorney general offered no support for his assertion that the FBI lacked a basis for opening the investigation and made no mention of the fact that the bureau began its investigation after a Trump campaign adviser purported to have early knowledge that Russia had dirt on his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>Barr, who has appointed a US attorney to scrutinize the origins of the Russia investigation, said the justice department has evidence there was \u201csomething far more troubling\u201d than just mistakes during the investigation that was eventually taken over by special counsel Robert Mueller.</p> <p>\u201cI think the president has every right to be frustrated, because I think what happened to him was one of the greatest travesties in American history,\u201d Barr said in the interview with Fox News Channel\u2019s Laura Ingraham.</p> <p>The attorney general asserted that the FBI launched its counterintelligence investigation into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia \u201cwithout any basis\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cEven more concerning, actually, is what happened after the campaign, a whole pattern of events while he was president,\u201d Barr said. \u201cTo sabotage the presidency, and I think that \u2013 or at least have the effect of sabotaging the presidency.\u201d</p> <p>The justice department\u2019s inspector general found in a December report that the FBI <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/09/fbi-trump-russia-investigation-ig-report\">was justified in opening the investigation</a> to protect against a potential national security threat.

Investigators were concerned about Page\u2019s ties to Russia, but never charged him with any wrongdoing.</p> <p>The inspector general, Michael Horowitz, has said the FBI failed to follow its own standards for accuracy and completeness in wiretap applications provided to the secretive foreign intelligence surveillance court.</p> <p>The report detailed 17 errors and omissions in the application process, including failing to tell the court when questions were raised about the reliability of some of the information it had presented to receive the warrants. Those mistakes prompted internal changes within the FBI and spurred a congressional debate over whether the bureau\u2019s surveillance tools should be reined in.</p> <p>But Barr said he believes they were more than just mistakes, offering a personal view of the investigation, a highly unusual move for a prosecutor during an ongoing investigation.</p> <p>\u201cMy own view is that the evidence shows that we\u2019re not dealing with just mistakes or sloppiness,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is something far more troubling here, and we\u2019re going to get to the bottom of it.</p> <p>The FBI began investigating on 31 July 2016 whether the Trump campaign was conspiring with Russia to sway the outcome of the presidential election.</p> <p>By that point, Russian hackers had broken into the Clinton campaign and other Democratic email accounts and George Papadopoulos, a Trump campaign adviser, had boasted to a diplomat that he was aware that Russia had derogatory information on Clinton.</p> <p>Though Trump and Barr have seized on errors made during the surveillance of Page, the investigation had already been under way for months by the time the first application was filed.</p> <p><em>Associated Press contributed to this report.</em></p>",

  "<h2><strong>Don\u2019t </strong><strong>forget to </strong><strong>scream \u2026</strong></h2> <p>Trump\u2019s promise to \u201cdrain the swamp\u201d reveals what we all knew in Peter Saul\u2019s deeply icky 2017 painting. The president is the monster in the mud: a greedy Florida alligator with a diseased, spotty hide. His orange coiffure sits on two such beasts, one chewing greenbacks in its enormous teeth. His head, sporting its notorious complacent smile, sprouts from another pot-bellied reptile<strong>.</strong></p> <h2><strong>Say it </strong><strong>again \u2026 </strong></h2> <p>Indeed, America\u2019s great maverick of misrule, the octogenarian Saul lamented that everyone had got there first when it came to insulting Trump. In the painter\u2019s gleefully offensive career he\u2019s used various presidents as conduits for laying bare the grotesqueries of power, including Nixon, Reagan and George W Bush. It\u2019s often said that the challenge with a figure so outre as Trump is that he\u2019s beyond satire. But Saul certainly has a good go.</p> <h2><strong>Talking </strong><strong>trash \u2026 </strong></h2> <p>Saul initially developed his art\u2019s scorching sensibility as a way of pushing back against the pure aspirations of American abstract expressionism. Rejecting the high art dogma of the 1950s\u2019 reigning critic Clement Greenberg, he wanted to make figurative paintings and partly drew inspiration from the violent crime comics he\u2019d loved as a kid. His work has plenty in common with the satirical Mad magazine and its pointed embrace of \u201ctrash\u201d culture.</p> <h2><strong>Looney </strong><strong>tunes \u2026 </strong></h2> <p>The artist has always been hell-bent on evoking heated reactions, whether he is tackling politics, war or art history\u2019s behemoths. Picasso\u2019s Guernica, which the artist learned of as a child, is one of a number of art icons he has parodied over the years to protest war or the degradations of mass culture. Its agonies were given a debased makeover in blaring Technicolor hues, while Rembrandt\u2019s The Night Watch was restaged with cartoon ducks.</p> <h2><strong>Body </strong><strong>horror \u2026 </strong></h2> <p>One of Saul\u2019s key anti-Vietnam war works, Saigon from 1967, also references Guernica. Picasso\u2019s screaming animals and people are translated in a horror show of comic-book sexual violence, with Asian babes born of racist, misogynist stereotypes prey to rampaging GIs. The painting\u2019s psychedelic palm trees recur throughout Saul\u2019s work, suggesting the reverberations of America\u2019s imperialist crimes. </p> <p><em><a href=\"https://www.phaidon.com/store/art/peter-saul-9781838660796/\" title=\"\">Peter Saul: Crime and Punishment</a></em><em> is published by Phaidon<strong> </strong></em></p>",

  "<p>If, like me, you have been confined to your home, glued to the news and nursing ever greater anxiety about the state of the world, you have probably become familiar with the sight of the World Health Organization\u2019s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, and his daily press briefings.

It is not just Trump \u2013 even some of the WHO\u2019s supporters in government, academia and NGOs argue that since the start of the coronavirus crisis, it has caved in to nationalist bullies, praised draconian quarantine measures and failed to protect the liberal international order of which it is a linchpin. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a situation where it looks like WHO doesn\u2019t want to exercise its authority,\u201d said David Fidler, a fellow in global health at the Council on Foreign Relations and a regular consultant to the WHO.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the WHO is desperately struggling to get its 194 member states to actually follow its guidance. The WHO\u2019s leaders are \u201cvery frustrated,\u201d said John MacKenzie, a virologist and adviser on the WHO\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.who.int/ihr/procedures/novel-coronavirus-2019/ec-22012020-members/en/\" title=\"\">emergency committee</a>. \u201cThe messages come out loud and clear, and some disregard the warnings. The US largely did, the UK largely did.\u201d</p> <p>On 11 March, the day Tedros declared the coronavirus a pandemic, he spoke darkly of \u201calarming levels of inaction\u201d from many countries. Pressed by journalists to name them, Mike Ryan, the usually no-nonsense Irish trauma doctor who heads the WHO\u2019s Covid-19 response, demurred. \u201cYou know who you are,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cwe don\u2019t criticise our member states in public\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f5d9b5d69d079af3d45a26a68aba8a4108aca8e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5d9b5d69d079af3d45a26a68aba8a4108aca8e6/0_100_4554_2732/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump at a coronavirus task force briefing at the White House on April 08, 2020 in Washington, DC.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump at a coronavirus task force briefing at the White House.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is a simple reason for this. For all the responsibility vested in the WHO, it has little power. Unlike international bodies such as the World Trade Organization, the WHO, which is a specialised body of the UN, has no ability to bind or sanction its members. Its annual operating budget, about $2bn in 2019, is smaller than that of many university hospitals, and split among a dizzying array of public health and research projects. The WHO is less like a military general or elected leader with a strong mandate, and more like an underpaid sports coach wary of \u201closing the dressing room\u201d, who can only get their way by charming, grovelling, cajoling and occasionally pleading with the players to do as they say.</p> <p>The WHO \u201chas been drained of power and resources\u201d, said Richard Horton, editor of the influential medical journal the Lancet. \u201cIts coordinating authority and capacity are weak. Its ability to direct an international response to a life-threatening epidemic is non-existent.\u201d</p> <p>At the same time, the international order on which the WHO relies is fraying, as aggressive nationalism becomes normalised around the world. \u201cAll the previous rules about global norms, public health and understanding of what\u2019s expected in terms of an outbreak has crumbled,\u201d said Lawrence Gostin, director of the WHO Collaborating Center on National and Global Health Law. \u201cNone of us know where this is leading.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>The WHO was born during the moment of hopeful internationalism that followed the chaos of the second world war. The idea of global collaboration in fighting disease was not new \u2013 in the 19th century, at periodic International Sanitary Conferences, countries had standardised quarantine procedures for cholera and yellow fever \u2013 but the WHO constitution, adopted in 1948, envisioned a far grander global mission, nothing less than \u201cthe attainment by all people of the highest possible levels of health\u201d.</p> <p>One of the WHO\u2019s favourite success stories is the role it played in eliminating smallpox, a disease that was still killing millions each year in the 50s, despite the existence of a vaccine. Although the WHO worked on immunisation research, its most vital role was organisational and diplomatic. In 1959, it convinced the Soviet Union to manufacture 25 million vaccine doses, which the WHO would distribute. Not to be left behind, the US donated millions of dollars to vaccination programmes, both directly and through the WHO. By the late 60s, every nation in the UN was sending a detailed weekly report to WHO headquarters on their number of smallpox cases and recent progress. And in 1979, WHO declared smallpox eradicated, a first in world history. The WHO didn\u2019t provide the most money, immunise the most people, or invent key technologies such as the <a href=\"https://www.globalhealthnow.org/object/bifurcated-needle\" title=\"\">bifurcated needle</a>, but it is hard to imagine smallpox having been defeated without it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4044c399a9a92c0ce5d57746c8e2d81421beb2e4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4044c399a9a92c0ce5d57746c8e2d81421beb2e4/0_0_4252_2835/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Posters of WHO chief Tedros Adhanom in Sao Paulo, Brazil last week.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Posters of WHO chief Tedros Adhanom in Sao Paulo, Brazil last week.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fernando Bizerra Jr/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If the story of smallpox eradication shows the WHO acting as something like an international ministry of public health, it doesn\u2019t explain its current position as an emergency service, surveying the world for disease outbreaks and springing into action to contain them. That is a more recent addition to its portfolio, which came after a period, in the 80s and 90s, when the WHO seemed to be losing its earlier dynamism. The diseases it was partly created to address \u2013 smallpox, yellow fever and the plague \u2013 had either been eradicated or were in decline, and it was slow to identify new threats such as HIV/Aids. Under the leadership of Dr Hiroshi Nakajima, from 1988 to 1998, the organisation stagnated, and some member states complained about poor management and alleged petty corruption.</p> <p>Two things happened at the turn of the century that would shape the WHO we now see tackling the Covid-19 crisis. In 1998, the fiery former prime minister of Norway, Dr Gro Harlem Brundtland, was elected director general. And in 2002, a farmer in China\u2019s Guangdong province became sick with a deadly, never-before-seen respiratory disease that quickly spread among the hospital staff who had treated him, and went on to become the first pandemic of the newly globalised 21st century: one that arose suddenly, had no treatment or cure, and spread with the speed and reach of international business.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Given the WHO\u2019s sprawling structure, vague mandate and reliance on diplomacy, its director general holds immense power to shape it. Even before she took on the role, Brundtland was comfortable on the world stage. \u201cI was already a political leader, and I was used to this kind of authority,\u201d she told me. Like her friend Kofi Annan, the charismatic UN leader, Brundtland believed that international bodies should be prepared to lead when necessary, rather than being bossed around by powerful nations. \u201cIf the job is to direct and coordinate global health, it\u2019s not a question of what one or several governments ask you to do,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are working for humanity.\u201d</p> <p>Brundtland pushed the WHO to use its local contacts, diplomatic channels and the emerging internet to locate potential outbreaks, all of which made the organisation less reliant on national governments for information. Within just a few years, this strategy proved its worth. In November 2002, when the Chinese government became aware of the first cases of a novel respiratory disease, later named Sars, it failed to alert the WHO. But, as part of Brundtland\u2019s new approach, WHO staff were monitoring Chinese medical message boards and news media anyway, and were aware of what was then thought to be an atypical pneumonia outbreak. Adding to their suspicions, on 10 February 2003, David Heymann, who was then executive director of the WHO\u2019s communicable diseases cluster, received an email from the son of a former WHO staff member in China warning of a \u201cstrange contagious disease\u201d that had already killed 100 people, but which was \u201cnot allowed to be made known to the public\u201d. The WHO took the information it had to China, which made its first official report to the WHO the next day.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fc41769b862cdfb9d6ccd578b4bfef561615bef5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc41769b862cdfb9d6ccd578b4bfef561615bef5/0_0_2000_1386/1000.jpg\" alt=\"WHO director-general Gro Harlem Brundtland (centre) gives polio immunisation to a young boy in New Delhi in January 2000.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"693\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">WHO director-general Gro Harlem Brundtland (centre) gives polio immunisation to a young boy in New Delhi in January 2000.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Mcconnico/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although the WHO had no formal powers to monitor and censure its members, Brundtland wasn\u2019t shy about doing so anyway. In the ensuing months she would accuse China of withholding information, claiming that the outbreak might have been contained \u201cif the WHO had been able to help at an earlier stage\u201d and exhorting the Chinese to \u201clet us come in as quickly as possible!\u201d With remarkable speed, China fell in line and shared its data with the WHO. \u201cAfter her statements to China, no other countries hesitated,\u201d said Heymann.</p> <p>In March 2003, as the disease spread \u2013 reaching Hong Kong, Vietnam and then Canada \u2013 for the first time in its history, the WHO issued <a href=\"https://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2003/pr23/en/\" title=\"\">advice against travelling</a> to affected areas. (Before then, the decision to advise on travel had always been left up to member states.) Despite having no formal powers to ground planes, the measures worked. \u201cPassengers and flights dropped dramatically as soon as we issued the recommendations,\u201d said Heymann.</p> <p>Brundtland\u2019s approach was not always popular, and some bridled under this new upstart WHO. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just China,\u201d Brundtland told me. \u201cThe mayor of Toronto [Mel Lastman] flew to Geneva to tell us take down the travel recommendation \u2013 while at the same time he was not containing the outbreak. He had people with Sars riding around the subway, no contact tracing, no following up. He couldn\u2019t accept we were telling him what to do!\u201d</p> <p>The WHO\u2019s response to Sars was considered a huge success. Fewer than 1,000 people worldwide died of the disease, despite it reaching a total of 26 countries. The pandemic was defeated not with vaccines or medicines, but with NPIs, or \u201cnon-pharmaceutical interventions\u201d in WHO parlance: travel warnings, tracking, testing and isolating cases, and a huge information-gathering operation across multiple countries, all made possible by the WHO\u2019s willingness to wield authority that it had, in a sense, created simply by speaking it into existence. \u201cBrundtland did things the WHO had no authority doing. She just did them,\u201d said Fidler. \u201cShe sort of used Sars as a way to test drive some very radical changes.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAfter Sars, the WHO\u2019s position was essentially: that was great, let\u2019s formalise it,\u201d said Clare Wenham, a professor of global health policy at LSE. In 2005, the WHO drew up a new version of the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/ihr/about/en/\" title=\"\">International Health Regulations (IHR)</a>, the central legal document that all member states are bound by. According to Fidler, the updated IHR, which is in force to this day, is a radical document. It asks its members to prepare for public health threats according to standards set by the WHO, and to report any outbreaks and all subsequent developments. It also allows the WHO to declare a public health emergency of international concern (or PHEIC, pronounced, incredibly, \u201cfake\u201d), using its own information, over the objection of any single country. During an emergency, countries are expected to take the lead from the WHO\u2019s guidelines and report any deviations to the organisation. All of these requirements, bar the reporting of outbreaks, were new.</p> <p>But the document stopped short of giving the WHO real power if states refuse to comply. \u201cThe WHO isn\u2019t Nato, it\u2019s not the security council,\u201d said Gian Luca Burci, who was the WHO\u2019s legal counsel until 2018. The US, fixated on bioterrorism after 9/11, supported giving the organisation some extended powers, but was opposed by Brazil, Russia, India and China, which were wary of US influence. There was a general reluctance to hand an international organisation any more power. \u201cWHO members were happy with the actions that were taken during Sars, but there was definitely a sense afterward of \u2018What if that was us in China\u2019s spot?\u2019,\u201d explained Catherine Worsnop, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Public Policy. In short: thanks for stopping the pandemic, but we don\u2019t want to be told what to do.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>If the WHO has seemed at times weak or tentative \u2013 very un-Brundtland-like \u2013 in its handling of the coronavirus crisis, it is partly because of its bruising experiences during the past decade. From 2009 onwards, the WHO faced condemnation from the press and the international community for its handling of successive crises, all during a decade when the financial and diplomatic order that sustained it began to break down.</p> <p>First, there was the outbreak of H1N1, or \u201cswine flu\u201d. The novel influenza virus was discovered in Mexico in March 2009, and by June, when the WHO declared a pandemic, there were more than 28,000 cases in 74 countries. Over the next year, the WHO coordinated the global response \u2013 less aggressively than during Sars \u2013 and on 10 August 2010, it declared the pandemic over. Almost immediately, the WHO\u2019s approach came under scrutiny. The death toll \u2013 18,500 confirmed deaths worldwide \u2013 was far lower than initially expected, particularly given the disease reached more than 200 countries. \u201cSuddenly you have people saying: \u2018Wait a minute, you really cried wolf on this,\u2019\u201d says Wenham. The media and several prominent European politicians demanded inquiries as to whether the WHO had mistakenly rung the alarm, and \u201ccost huge amounts of money and frightened people unnecessarily\u201d, as Paul Flynn, the former Labour MP who chaired one of the inquiries, told the Times in 2010.</p> <p>To this day, opinions are split as to whether H1N1 was a crisis headed off, or a false alarm. \u201cThe WHO is always at risk of being criticised as doing too much or too little,\u201d said Keiji Fukuda, the former WHO assistant director general who led the H1N1 response. Most of the former WHO staff and academics I spoke with agreed, proposing some version of the following as an iron law of public health: act slowly and you will be criticised for failing to stop preventable deaths; act aggressively and stop an outbreak before it becomes serious, and you will be accused of having overreacted. (After all, in the latter case, nothing too bad happened, so what was the big deal in the first place?)</p> <p>Fidler, who largely approves of WHO\u2019s quick action during H1N1, believes that the backlash led the WHO, which was then under the command of director general Margaret Chan, to become too tentative about calling for action in the future. This was a period when the fallout from the 2008 financial crisis was also starting to take its toll on its budget. \u201cThere was a big funding shortfall,\u201d said Andrew Cassels, director of strategy at the WHO between 2008 and 2013. \u201cCuts made to the emergency response programmes, personnel cuts.\u201d The funding gap stood at nearly $300m in 2012. Entire offices were shut, including a team of social scientists working on pandemic response.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"29cfebe6451704d592d057ee78cfddfd9ae9f240\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29cfebe6451704d592d057ee78cfddfd9ae9f240/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"WHO staff training nurses to use protective gear in Freetown, Sierra Leone during the 2014 ebola outbreak.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">WHO staff training nurses to use protective gear in Freetown, Sierra Leone during the 2014 ebola outbreak.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Duff/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When the Ebola outbreak struck west Africa in 2014, the combination of the WHO\u2019s greater caution and reduced budget resulted in disaster. In contrast to the previous pandemic, this time the WHO was slow to act, and was widely perceived to have lost control of the situation. In the end, the US and several other nations <a href=\"https://www.lshtm.ac.uk/newsevents/news/2015/foreign_military_response_crucial_to_ebola.html\" title=\"\">deployed</a> more than 5,000 military personnel at the request of the affected countries, and an ad-hoc UN committee was created to take over responsibilities from the WHO. The outbreak eventually killed 11,310 people, the vast majority in just three countries \u2013 Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone \u2013 paralysing their health systems for months, and causing panic across the world. Prominent scientists <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/22/experts-criticise-world-health-organisation-who-delay-ebola-outbreak\" title=\"\">judged</a> the WHO\u2019s response an \u201cegregious failure\u201d.</p> <p>Much of the blame fell on Chan herself. She appeared shell-shocked, stressing to the press that the WHO was a technical advisory body, and that it was national governments that had ultimate responsibility for their citizens\u2019 health. \u201cShe wanted the WHO to be an apolitical agency \u2013 more like technical support. There was a hesitancy there to push the full powers of the WHO,\u201d said Sara Davies, a professor of global health at Griffith University in Australia.</p> <p>The bold, proactive culture established after Sars had seemingly faded. Fidler believes that by delaying calling Ebola an emergency, and thus failing to organise an international response at a crucial moment, the WHO\u2019s leadership had shown they \u201cno longer had any faith in their authority\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Today, under Tedros, the WHO finds itself in uncharted territory. Not only is it facing by far the biggest pandemic in its history, it is also having to defend itself from the nations on which it most depends. \u201cIn my 25-plus years of working on global health issues, I cannot recall the leader of a prominent developed country threatening to punish WHO in the manner President Trump did,\u201d said Fidler, referring to the recent press conference in which Trump suggested putting \u201ca very powerful hold\u201d on US contributions to the WHO. In the same press conference, Trump accused the WHO of concealing information, being too slow to react to the virus, and, above all, showing favouritism towards China.</p> <p>Since the crisis began, Tedros has been repeatedly accused of being soft on China. Senator Marco Rubio recently <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/bolton-joins-calls-for-who-directors-resignation-accomplice-to-chinas-massive-coverup\" title=\"\">told</a> Fox News that the Chinese government had \u201cused the WHO to mislead the world\u201d, and claimed that the WHO \u201cis either complicit or dangerously incompetent\u201d. The US senator Rick Scott put it more bluntly, accusing the WHO of \u201chelping Communist China cover up a global pandemic\u201d. (Tedros, meanwhile, has warned of the dangers of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2020/apr/09/politicising-covid-19-like-playing-with-fire-who-director-general-says-after-trump-attack-video\">politicising the virus</a>.)</p> <p>Until very recently, the WHO was seen as a relatively neutral arena for China to extend its power. \u201cChina likes to find ways within the global system to give it a leading and benevolent image. The WHO was an uncontroversial place to do it,\u201d said Rana Mitter, the director of the University of Oxford China Centre. No longer. The extent of the initial coverup is still unclear, but there is no question that at least at the local level, Chinese officials knew about the outbreak of a novel disease for weeks before it was reported to the WHO. During that time, Chinese doctors were prevented from speaking out.</p> <p>John MacKenzie, the WHO\u2019s emergency committee adviser, told me that the organisation was \u201ca little misled\u201d about the Wuhan outbreak. He says that by the time the government alerted the WHO on 31 December, scientists in China had already determined via genome sequencing that the outbreak was caused by coronavirus. Yet the government didn\u2019t confirm that until 7 January and the full genome sequence was not officially shared until 12 January. \u201cThat\u2019s very slow,\u201d MacKenzie told me. \u201cFor at least two weeks, we could have been making far more kits and so on for testing.\u201d MacKenzie added that the number of cases officially declared by the Chinese in the first week \u2013 59 in the week ending 5 January \u2013 was \u201cnowhere near as many cases as you\u2019d expect\u201d. (The statistics released by the Chinese government continue to be questioned, with some <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/world/asia/coronavirus-china-grief-deaths.html?auth=login-email&amp;login=email\" title=\"\">reports</a> suggesting they may have seriously understated the number of coronavirus deaths.)</p> <p>Despite mounting frustrations \u2013 in mid-January, China also refused the WHO\u2019s request to send a team of scientific observers to Hubei province, the centre of the outbreak \u2013 Tedros has never come close to doing what Brundtland did and calling China out. Instead, on 28 January, he had a closed-door meeting with Xi Jinping in Beijing, and two days later, he praised Chinese efforts to contain the disease, declaring that China is \u201csetting a new standard for outbreak control\u201d. That same day, 30 January, the WHO declared a Pheic, and began issuing prescriptions to countries around the world. On 8 February, China finally allowed WHO observers into the country. For Tedros\u2019s supporters, this was vindication of his strategy of keeping China onside. For his critics, it was too little, too late.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"10a09ac53b686e3d6a7da5a1660151fdfce8847e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/10a09ac53b686e3d6a7da5a1660151fdfce8847e/0_177_3996_2398/1000.jpg\" alt=\"WHO director-general Adhanom Ghebreyesus with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing on 28 January 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">WHO director-general Adhanom Ghebreyesus with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing on 28 January 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Naohiko Hatta/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Elected as WHO director general in July 2017, Tedros was supported by a bloc of African and Asian countries, including China, which has considerable influence with those members. (Tedros is himself from Ethiopia, where he served as health minister and then foreign minister between 2005 and 2016.) It was a \u201creally nasty\u201d election, said Davies, in which the powers that have traditionally shaped the WHO, such as the US, UK and Canada, lent their support to one of Tedros\u2019s rivals, the British doctor David Nabarro. During the campaign, Tedros was criticised for having served in a repressive government with a poor human rights record, and one of Nabarro\u2019s backers even <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/23/who-elects-first-ever-african-director-general-after-tense-vote-tedros-adhanom-ghebreyesus\" title=\"\">accused</a> Tedros of covering up a cholera epidemic during his time as health minister. (Tedros <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/13/health/candidate-who-director-general-ethiopia-cholera-outbreaks.html\" title=\"\">denied the</a> claim, describing it as a \u201clast-minute smear campaign\u201d, while Nabarro told the New York Times that he had never authorised his team to make this accusation against Tedros.) In response, Tedros\u2019s supporters mounted \u201ca collective pushback\u201d, said Davies, against the UK and its allies, eventually winning out. Tedros became the first director general from a so-called developing country since the Brazilian Dr Marcolino Gomes Candau in 1953.</p> <p>While his background is in politics, Tedros is not forthright or confrontational like Brundtland. In Ethiopia, his political party, the Tigray People\u2019s Liberation Front (TPLF) was mostly comprised of ex-revolutionaries, men that \u201cseemed carved out of a rock\u201d, said Fantu Cheru, a professor at American University and former advisor to the Ethiopian government. Tedros was different \u2013 jovial and accessible, said Cheru, and able to make personal connections easily. \u201cHe is not very ideological, he believes he can work with anyone,\u201d said Mehari Taddele Maru, a professor at the European University Institute in Florence, Italy. Cheru also sees Tedros as a pragmatist. \u201cHe\u2019s not in the Chinese pocket. The Americans in particular wanted to destroy his image. Tedros knows how this game works. You need to have more allies than enemies, and those allies may not have a good track record.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think Tedros did anything previous director generals would not have done,\u201d said Anthony Costello, the director of the UCL Institute for Global Health. \u201cHe needed a good relationship with China in order to get in.\u201d Even Lawrence Gostin, who has been a prominent critic of Tedros in the past, told me that \u201chis high praise for China is understandable. He is seeking to coax China into cooperation.\u201d He went on to note, though, that this strategy \u201cdoes risk the credibility of WHO as an objective agency.\u201d</p> <p>If the WHO thought it could sacrifice a bit of its credibility \u2013 overlooking China\u2019s obvious blunders in December and January in exchange for its compliance in February \u2013 and move on, it was mistaken. The argument over China\u2019s influence has been raging for weeks, not least since the government of Taiwan <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-taiwan/taiwan-says-who-ignored-its-coronavirus-questions-at-start-of-outbreak-idUSKBN21B160\" title=\"\">claimed</a> that the WHO had ignored its own early reports of human-to-human transmission of coronavirus as part of a larger history of appeasing China \u2013 which has blocked Taiwan from joining the WHO (and the UN) for decades.</p> <p>Now that Trump, scrambling for an answer to explain why the US now has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/08/coronavirus-world-map-which-countries-have-most-cases-deaths-covid-19\" title=\"\">more cases</a> of coronavirus than any other nation, has alighted upon the WHO and China as his preferred scapegoats, these questions will not go away. \u201cI don\u2019t think we will see the US government cut off funding,\u201d said Fidler. \u201cBut what\u2019s happened with this pandemic \u2013 with the WHO caught between the US/China rivalry \u2013 is not a good omen for the WHO going forward.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>While the focus has been on what happened between China and the WHO in January, in epidemiological terms the crisis has moved on. Covid-19 has spread fastest and furthest in the US and Europe, through the very rich nations that largely fund and staff the WHO. Before the outbreak, the WHO struggled to get these same nations to prepare for future pandemics. Now the pandemic is here, and they are at the centre of the crisis, the WHO has been unable to keep them following its advice.</p> <p>Richard Horton of the Lancet said that after the WHO declared a public health emergency, \u201ccountries, especially western countries, didn\u2019t listen. Or didn\u2019t seek to understand what was actually taking place in China.\u201d On 5 February, the WHO <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/05-02-2020-us-675-million-needed-for-new-coronavirus-preparedness-and-response-global-plan\" title=\"\">asked for</a> $675m to fund its Coronavirus response through to April. Anthony Costello of UCL said that when he met with Tedros on 4 March, the WHO had received only $1.2m. (Tedros announced last week that the funding goal had finally been reached, around the time the number of worldwide cases passed 1 million.)</p> <p>Even the decision to declare a pandemic on 13 March \u2013 a largely rhetorical distinction, since calling a Pheic already requires WHO members to respond \u2013 was calculated to wake its member states up. In the UK the Premier League was still playing games, and the previous week the US had held primary election contests. \u201cThey declared a pandemic because countries weren\u2019t taking the advice,\u201d said Adam Kamradt-Scott, a professor of global health at the University of Sydney.</p> <p>The WHO stresses that the ideal response to the crisis is relatively simple. Individual states should limit public exposure, especially by tracking and tracing all known cases \u2013 a strategy that worked in South Korea and appears to be working in Germany. On an international level, states should share scientific information and resources. These are the mantras Tedros goes back to in his briefings: \u201cTest test test\u201d and \u201csolidarity solidarity solidarity\u201d.</p> <p>But countries have repeatedly ignored WHO advice. In the UK, the response has been erratic, lurching between the WHO\u2019s norms and its own strategies, such as the now-discredited pursuit of \u201cherd immunity\u201d. The US didn\u2019t recommend school closures or avoiding travel until 16 March. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/05/sweden-prepares-to-tighten-coronavirus-measures-as-death-toll-climbs\" title=\"\">In Sweden</a>, restaurants are still open.</p> <p>Many wealthy nations have not only pursued their own national strategies for public health, but have also withdrawn from the globalised world of diplomacy and trade that they themselves set up.
