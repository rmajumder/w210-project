This includes what\u2019s known as \u201c<a href=\"https://foodfirst.org/what-is-parity-and-why-you-should-care/\">parity</a>\u201d \u2013 a fair price for farmers\u2019 crops, guaranteed by the government, to prevent overproduction and market chaos.</p> \n   <p>Subsidies that currently <a href=\"https://ips-dc.org/we-subsidize-the-wrong-kind-of-agriculture/\">propel</a> farming consolidation and mass production of commodities for livestock feed and fuel must be reformed to promote organic, smaller-scale, regionally and local foods. This will help farmers survive and provide communities with resilient and diverse food supplies rather than depending on vast and fragile corporate food supply chains.</p> \n   <p>If there were ever a time to bust up the food and farming monopolies, which are reminiscent of the Beef Trust of the early 1900s, now is it. Centralized corporate power is creating agricultural and economic mono-cropping at a time when we most need a food system that\u2019s diverse, equitable and sustainable.</p> \n   <p>The Covid-19 crisis and worsening climate chaos require far more public-sector direction and coordination of something as central to human survival as food.</p> \n   <p>Amid the current supply-chain breakdown, as news spread of gargantuan food waste, some <a href=\"https://www.wkbw.com/news/state-news/new-york-state-farmers-donate-34-000-pounds-of-milk-beef-and-produce-to-nyc-families-in-need?fbclid=IwAR0L4qkyEIvINGqaGblka5BiOrPTgo-nazaGBJYCfFNmFZ_Zc2NMqz81txU\">farmers</a> and <a href=\"https://www.king5.com/article/news/health/coronavirus/caravan-brings-thousands-of-pound-to-produce-to-western-washington-for-families-in-need/281-1eae725e-6923-4bcc-b7e2-ffb86f4ad56b?fbclid=IwAR2jloI75BLLJRtGwr2uRvLSTU4PlszVTxfkitpzxyheVfiS-euVBTKVfLA\">caravans</a> of volunteers have helped deliver food directly from the farms to people in need \u2013 a truly heroic gift.</p> \n   <p>But this vital act, feeding people in need and averting massive food waste, can\u2019t be left to random acts of kindness.

  "<p>Tara Reade repeated her allegations of sexual assault against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden\">Joe Biden</a> in an in-depth interview with Megyn Kelly released on Friday evening, answering questions on who she shared her story with and why she supported the former vice-president publicly in the past.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/03/gretchen-whitmer-backs-joe-biden-sexual-assault\">Gretchen Whitmer backs Joe Biden on alleged assault: 'not every claim is equal'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In her first major appearance since she came forward in March, Reade tearfully recounted the alleged assault, offering new details about three minutes of her life she says she will \u201cnever forget\u201d.</p> <p>Biden has forcefully denied Reade\u2019s allegations.</p> <p>Reade told Kelly, a former Fox News and NBC host, she was excited when she was hired as a staff assistant in Biden\u2019s Senate office in 1992. Almost immediately, she said, Biden made her uncomfortable with behavior she said included putting his hand on her neck in a meeting.</p> <p>Reade said she reported Biden\u2019s conduct to superiors and was told to dress more conservatively. All such former Biden staffers have emphatically denied ever being informed of such a complaint.</p> <p>Not long after this conversation, Reade told Kelly, she was asked to deliver a bag to Biden in the Russell Senate office building. It was then, she said, that Biden pinned her against a wall in a hallway and penetrated her with his fingers, against her will.</p> <p>\u201cHe had his hands underneath my clothes and it happened all at once,\u201d Reade continued. She said Biden asked if she wanted to \u201cgo somewhere else\u201d and told her \u201cI want to fuck you\u201d, a detail she has not previously shared.</p> <p>She said Biden pulled back when he saw she wasn\u2019t reciprocating. \u201cHe looked at me and said \u2018C\u2019mon man, I heard you liked me\u2019,\u201d Reade said. \u201cHe pointed his finger at me and said \u2018You\u2019re nothing to me\u2019,\u201d she added.</p> <p>\u201cIt is not true,\u201d Biden told <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/us/politics/joe-biden-tara-reade-morning-joe.html\">MSNBC</a> last week, his first public comment since the allegation emerged in March. \u201cI\u2019m saying unequivocally it never, never happened.\u201d</p> <p>He again denied the allegation on a news channel in Tampa on Thursday, after Kelly published excerpts of her interview.</p> <p>\u201cIn this case, the truth is the claims are flat out false,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In the 42-minute interview, Kelly asked Reade detailed questions about the alleged incident and the repercussions Reade says she faced.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t really care if people believe it or not,\u201d Reade said. \u201cI\u2018ve had to live with it and it\u2019s just one of those things that shattered and impacted my life. It changed everything about my life.\u201d</p> <p>She was also pressed on who she told about the allegations and why she came forward now.</p> <p>Reade said she did not consider telling her story publicly in 2008, when Biden was chosen as Barack Obama\u2019s running mate, because her daughter was still young. Asked why she voted for Obama and Biden in 2008 and 2012, the lifelong Democrat said: \u201cI wasn\u2019t voting for him. I was voting for Obama.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/24/joe-biden-sexual-assault-claim-tara-reade-deserves-to-be-heard-katie-halper\">Tara Reade says Joe Biden sexually assaulted her. She deserves to be heard | Katie Halper</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Reade was one of eight women who came forward last year to accuse Biden of conduct that made them feel uncomfortable. She went public with her allegation of sexual abuse <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/24/joe-biden-sexual-assault-claim-tara-reade-deserves-to-be-heard-katie-halper\">on a podcast on 25 March</a>.</p> <p>Several media organizations, including the New York Times, the Associated Press and Vox, have investigated Reade\u2019s story.</p> <p>Reade told Kelly she thought Biden should withdraw from the presidential race and should not be running on his character.</p> <p>She said she would \u201cabsolutely\u201d be willing to tell her story under oath and submit to cross-examination. Asked if she would take a polygraph test, she said: \u201cI\u2019m not a criminal. Joe Biden should take the polygraph.\u201d</p> <p>On Thursday, <a href=\"https://www.sanluisobispo.com/news/politics-government/article242527331.html\">the San Luis Obispo Tribune</a> unearthed a court document which stated that Reade told her ex-husband she had been subject to sexual harassment while working in Biden\u2019s office. It is the first contemporaneous record to emerge.</p> <p>According to the document filed in the California superior court on 25 March 1996, Theodore Dronen said Reade told him about \u201ca problem she was having at work regarding sexual harassment, in US senator Joe Biden\u2019s office\u201d. The Tribune reported that the document does not state who committed the harassment nor does it mention Reade\u2019s allegation of sexual assault.</p> <p>Dronen wrote that Reade told him she had struck a deal with the chief of staff and \u201cleft her position\u201d. The experience had a \u201cvery traumatic effect\u201d, he added. The court declaration was in response to Reade\u2019s request for a temporary restraining order against Dronen.</p> <p>Donald Trump\u2019s campaign has sought to weaponize the allegation while Republicans have accused Democrats standing by their nominee of hypocrisy. Trump has been more circumspect. In an interview with Fox &amp; Friends on Friday, the president said he hoped Reade\u2019s allegation was \u201cfalse\u201d and compared Biden\u2019s predicament to his own.</p> <p>Trump has been accused of sexual misconduct and assault by more than a dozen women, charges he denies. He has advised Biden to \u201cgo out and fight\u201d the claim.</p> <p>On Thursday, the law firm of Douglas Wigdor announced that it was representing Reade. Wigdor, who donated to Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, has represented Fox News employees in a race discrimination and harassment lawsuit as well as women who accused movie producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual misconduct.</p> <p>\u201cOur representation of Tara Reade has nothing to do with politics,\u201d the firm said.</p> <p>Kelly, who memorably sparred with Trump in 2016 over his treatment of women,<strong> </strong>was among prominent women at Fox News to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/21/roger-ailes-sexual-harassment-accusations-fox-news\">accuse</a> its chairman, Roger Ailes, of sexual harassment.

Right on cue, Jameela Jamil, who never misses an opportunity to opine on body image issues, strode into the debate. \u201cAdele would hate this so much,\u201d the actor and activist <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jameelajamil/status/1258504640829681666?s=20\">tweeted</a> on Thursday, with a photo montage of Skinny Adele memes. \u201cI\u2019m so glad she isn\u2019t [on Twitter] to see people weaponize her body against women. These memes are everywhere. This is so offensive. So destructive. So reductive. It encourages us to demonize and become afraid of food.\u201d</p> <p>Those are all good points. Nevertheless, one does have to wonder exactly how helpful it is for Jamil to have shared the memes with her 1.1 million followers.</p> <p>You\u2019d think that during a once-in-a-century pandemic that is devastating the world we\u2019d all have gained a little perspective. You\u2019d think that we might have lost interest in how much a celebrity weighs. Alas, policing female bodies and appetites is a timeless trend. We\u2019ve been doing it since Eve was shamed for gluttonously eating that apple and, no doubt, we\u2019ll be doing it until we get hit by an asteroid or the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/27/pentagon-releases-three-ufo-videos-taken-by-us-navy-pilots\">aliens arrive</a> to put us all out of our misery. Despite all the progress there has been around gender equality much of the world is still more interested in what goes into a woman\u2019s mouth than what comes out of it.</p> <h2>Jacob Wohl is at the centre of yet another fake sexual assault allegation</h2> <p>The pro-Trump smear artist reportedly <a href=\"https://reason.com/2020/05/07/she-said-anthony-fauci-sexually-assaulted-her-now-she-says-jacob-wohl-and-jack-burkman-paid-her-to-lie/\">paid</a> a woman called Diana Andrade to pretend that Dr Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, had sexually assaulted her. Andrade initially went through with the plan but then had second thoughts and blew the whistle. Wohl, and his equally odious sidekick Jack Burkman, have a history of trying to (very badly) fabricate sexual harassment allegations against the likes of Robert Mueller, Pete Buttigieg and Elizabeth Warren. Last year he claimed that Warren had paid for an S&amp;M relationship with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/05/go-cougars-elizabeth-warren-gave-the-classiest-response-to-a-rightwing-trolls-lie\">twentysomething marine.</a> Wohl is a complete joke but his antics do a lot of damage to the credibility of sexual assault survivors.</p> <h2>Betsy DeVos revises campus sexual assault legislation</h2> <p>The US education secretary (and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jul/26/betsy-devos-yacht-vandalism-protest\">owner of multiple yachts</a>) <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/06/betsy-devos-sexual-assault-title-ix-rules\">has issued new rules on sexual assault in schools and colleges</a>; equal rights groups argue these revisions \u201ctip the scales in favor\u201d of abusers and reduce the rights of survivors. The new regulations are expected to be challenged in court.</p> <h2>Love in the time of corona</h2> <p>That headline has already been used approximately 10 billion times so far in articles about romance during the coronavirus crisis.

I\u2019m sure Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez would be very proud.</p> <h2>Tara Reade calls on Joe Biden to drop out</h2> <p>Reade, who has accused Biden of sexually assaulting her in 1993, called on the presumptive Democratic nominee to drop out of the presidential race <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/07/tara-reade-megyn-kelly-interview-joe-biden-drop-out\">during an on-camera interview with Megyn Kelly</a>. Reade also says she is prepared to take a polygraph test if Biden also takes one. (There\u2019s a huge amount of controversy around the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45736631\">credibility of the polygraph</a>, so I\u2019m not sure that would really help anything.)</p> <h2>Women are being \u2018tossed to the wind\u2019 in birth control case</h2> <p>The US supreme court has been <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-oral-arguments-employer-birth-control/\">hearing arguments</a> on whether the Trump administration can make it easier for employers to stop providing free birth control coverage in their insurance plans for religious or moral reasons. <a href=\"https://qz.com/1852501/rbg-says-women-tossed-to-the-wind-in-scotus-birth-control-case/\">Ruth Bader Ginsburg has said</a> that the government is attempting to \u201cto toss to the wind entirely Congress\u2019s instruction that women need and shall have seamless no-cost coverage\u201d.</p> <h2>Men and women disagree about how much time they spend on chores</h2> <p>Nearly half of men say they do most of the home schooling during lockdown, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/06/upshot/pandemic-chores-homeschooling-gender.html\">according to a poll by the New York Times</a>. Weirdly, only 3% of women agree their spouse is doing more.</p> <h2>The women battling to free Myanmar from meth</h2> <p>Mostly in their 40s and 50s, a group of vigilante women are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/may/07/theyre-fearless-the-women-battling-to-free-myanmar-from-meth\">apprehending drug traffickers in the jungle</a>.</p> <h2>Gendered lockdown fueling hate crime in Bogot\u00e1</h2> <p>There have been at least <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/may/08/separation-by-sex-gendered-lockdown-fuelling-hate-on-streets-of-bogota\">20 violent incidents</a> against trans people in supermarkets during lockdown since Colombia started a policy in which men and women are allowed out of quarantine on separate days.</p> <h2>107-year-old artist survives Covid-19</h2> <p>Marilee Shapiro Asher also <a href=\"https://www.jta.org/2020/05/06/united-states/she-survived-the-1918-spanish-flu-pandemic-and-covid-19-what-is-marilee-shapiro-ashers-secret\">beat the 1918 Spanish flu when she was six</a>.

  "<p>Barack Obama has reportedly said the \u201crule of law is at risk\u201d in the US, after the justice department <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/07/michael-flynn-criminal-case-trump-russia\">said it would drop its case</a> against former national security adviser Michael Flynn.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/08/trump-attorney-general-william-barr-flynn-case\">For Trump, l'etat, c'est moi.

That\u2019s the kind of stuff where you begin to get worried that basic \u2013 not just institutional norms \u2013 but our basic understanding of rule of law is at risk.</p> <p>\u201cAnd when you start moving in those directions, it can accelerate pretty quickly as we\u2019ve seen in other places.\u201d</p> <p>The president has repeatedly blamed Obama for the FBI investigation into Russian election interference which expanded to include links between his campaign and Moscow. Last week, Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/may/04/don-lemon-trump-cnn-coronavirus-conspiracy-theories\">retweeted a conspiracy theorist</a> who claimed Obama directed the investigation.</p> <p>On Thursday Trump said at the White House: \u201cWhat they did, what the Obama administration did, is unprecedented \u2026 and I hope a lot of people will pay a big price because they are dishonest, crooked people. They are scum, human scum.\u201d</p> <p>The president added: \u201c[Flynn] was targeted by the Obama administration, and he was targeted in order to try to take down a president.\u201d</p> <p>After nearly two years of work, special counsel Robert Mueller did not establish a criminal conspiracy but did detail extensive links between Trump aides and Russians and numerous instances of possible obstruction of justice by the president.</p> <p>Trump claims exoneration by Mueller. Mueller said he was not exonerating Trump.</p> <p>Flynn\u2019s guilty plea to lying to the FBI was one of Mueller\u2019s biggest coups. In 2017 Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/937007006526959618?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E937007006526959618&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fus-news%2F2020%2Fmay%2F07%2Fmichael-flynn-criminal-case-trump-russia\">acknowledged</a> it, writing on Twitter: \u201cI had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice-President and the FBI. He has pled guilty to those lies. It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful. There was nothing to hide!\u201d</p> <p>According to Yahoo News, Obama told the web call the case made him feel a \u201csense of urgency\u201d about November\u2019s election, in which Trump is set to face Joe Biden, Obama\u2019s vice-president.</p> <p>\u201cWhenever I campaign,\u201d Obama reportedly said, \u201cI\u2019ve always said, \u2018Ah, this is the most important election.\u2019 Especially obviously when I was on the ballot, that always feels like it\u2019s the most important election. This one, I\u2019m not on the ballot but I am pretty darn invested. We got to make this happen.\u201d</p> <p>Obama reportedly said the election would be about fighting \u201clong-term trends in which being selfish, being tribal, being divided, and seeing others as an enemy [have] become a stronger impulse in American life\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s part of the reason,\u201d he reportedly said, \u201cwhy the response to this global crisis [the coronavirus outbreak] has been so anaemic and spotty. It would have been bad even with the best of governments. It has been an absolute chaotic disaster when that mindset of \u2018what\u2019s in it for me\u2019 and \u2018to heck with everybody else\u2019, when that mindset is operationalised in our government.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why, I, by the way, am going to be spending as much time as necessary and campaigning as hard as I can for Joe Biden.\u201d</p> <p>As of Saturday morning, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University, 1,283,762 cases of Covid-19 had been confirmed in the US, with 77,175 deaths. Encouraged by the White House, more than half the 50 states are seeking to reopen their shuttered economies, despite warnings from public health experts that it is too soon to do so without risking a high death toll.</p> <p>Obama has followed precedent in not criticising his successor in the Oval Office in public but reports of his view of Trump are fairly regular. In January, for example, it was reported that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/27/obama-warned-trump-fascist-2016-hulu-film-hillary-clinton-sundance\">he said Trump was a fascist</a>.</p> <p>On Saturday Trump was at the White House. He did not immediately respond to the Yahoo News report.</p> <p>However the attorney general, William Barr, perhaps spoke for the president earlier when he was <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/attorney-general-william-barr-on-michael-flynn-obamacare-and-coronavirus-restrictions-transcript/\">asked</a> how he thought history would view his decision to drop the Flynn case.</p> <p>\u201cWell, history is written by the winner,\u201d he told CBS News. \u201cSo it largely depends on who\u2019s writing the history.\u201d<br></p>",

Fellow Titan <strong>Nathan Peats</strong> and Manly\u2019s<strong> Marty Taupau</strong> both hesitated to get the shot due to past adverse reactions, but eventually had the injection.</p> \n  <p>As of Saturday afternoon, the Titans were still awaiting confirmation from Cartwright and Kelly over whether they would agree to be immunised and resume training.</p> \n  <p>It\u2019s understood <strong>Dylan Walker</strong>, <strong>Addin Fonua-Blake</strong>, <strong>Josh Papalii</strong>, <strong>Joseph Tapine</strong>, <strong>Iosia Soliola</strong> and Canterbury\u2019s <strong>Sione Katoa </strong>all signed a waiver to remain compliant under the NRL\u2019s guidelines and continue training.</p> \n  <p>It has sparked confusion over how different states and territories will enforce the NRL\u2019s return to training protocols, and casts doubt over whether unimmunised players will be allowed to play in Queensland.</p> \n  <p>Graham, who sits on the RLPA\u2019s board of directors, said the confusion was always a risk as the game rushed to resume training. He believes players and clubs could have sacrificed another week of training as a team to ensure these loose ends in the biosecurity guidelines were tied up.</p> \n  <p>Should the NRL decide to bow to government pressure and enact a \u2018no jab, no play\u2019 policy, Graham says players will need to consider the strength of their convictions against their livelihoods.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I know for me, if I don\u2019t like a flu jab, if it puts my livelihood at risk preventing me from making some money to feed my family, I\u2019m getting the flu jab.</p> \n   <p>It\u2019s simple in my eyes ... It depends on how strong their convictions are on an individual level.

\u201csnap back\u201d in the economy once the crisis has passed is nothing more than \u201ca marketing slogan from the prime minister who doesn\u2019t have economic plan\u201d.</p> \n   <p>\u201cWe

<p>Treasury says it is possible to restore 851,000 jobs in coming months if things go to plan.</p> \n   <p>The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said regional and interstate travel restrictions need to be lifted as soon as is practicable to breathe life back into regional and urban economies.</p> \n   <p>\u201cAustralian businesses depend on operating as seamlessly as possible

(Cognisant that last week the federal education minister <strong>Dan Tehan</strong> similarly attacked Andrews \u2013 over school closures \u2013 and then was forced to rapidly apologise).</p> \n  <p>I\u2019m going to run Wilson\u2019s quote in full so readers can make up their own minds. He was speaking on ABC TV with WA Labor member <strong>Josh Wilson</strong> (the member for Fremantle, no relation (<em>at least I don\u2019t think so!</em>) about different states easing restrictions at different times.</p> \n  <p><strong>Tim Wilson</strong>:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I\u2019m a federalist and I believe that we should have local laws reflecting local conditions. But the other reason is because it puts the burden and responsibility on the states to actually explain why they\u2019ve taken the different approaches. Now, they\u2019re taking the point that Josh [Wilson] has just raised \u2013 you know, WA has done things differently. They let kids go back to school earlier, whereas Victoria is saying no. The burden and the responsibility then has to be on Dan Andrews, when other states are allowing people to go and visit their mums on Mother\u2019s Day, why can\u2019t we go and visit in Victoria, our mums on Mother\u2019s Day? Why can\u2019t we send our kids to school? Why are businesses being unnecessarily punished longer than in other states? And he has to come out and articulate that case and take responsibility for it.</p> \n   <p>I\u2019ve just outlined some serious questions I think that Dan Andrews needs to answer for Victorians, if he wants to maintain public confidence. <strong>Because I think ... and there is actually now a narrative that\u2019s building in parts of Victoria where people are increasingly concerned that he\u2019s probably enjoying the </strong><strong>clampdown too much in terms of the authority and power it\u2019s given him</strong>, <strong>and he\u2019s not as enthusiastic to roll it back.</strong> </p> \n   <p>So, people will have their own opinions.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Wilson later went on to say he was reflecting the sentiments expressed on the front page of the <strong>Herald Sun</strong> as evidence of the \u201cnarrative\u201d he was referring to.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I made the observation of what\u2019s in the Victorian press, and you need to actually go and read the Victorian press. I understand in WA that may not be the case, but the front page of the Herald Sun today is very clear, wanting to understand the rationale, the reasoning, behind why Dan Andrews is not reopening Victoria as other states are doing.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>But there are three words at the beginning of that key sentence: \u201c<strong>Because I think.</strong>\u201d</p> \n  <p>Victoria has the second-highest total of Covid-19 cases in the country (1,468) behind only NSW.</p> \n  <p>Andrews said on Thursday:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Nobody is enjoying these settings, I understand that, but it is ... important to stay the course on this, not just to do what we want to do, but to do what is ... in the interests of every single Victorian family, every single Victorian business.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And yesterday: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I can tell you what I will be doing on Mother\u2019s Day, I will not be visiting my mum. She is in good health, but has underlying health issues. I just wouldn\u2019t do it. I would very much like to.</p> \n   <p>These are unprecedented times. We are all doing things very differently.

  "<p>The Tampa, Florida, rally for Joe Biden on Thursday evening began as it normally might have, before a once-in-a-century pandemic transformed all aspects of American life, including the presidential campaign. A local high school student recited the pledge of allegiance, a campaign organizer pleaded with supporters to volunteer and a local DJ spun R&amp;B music between speakers.</p> \n<p>But in a sign of how profoundly the coronavirus crisis has reshaped American politics, that was where the similarities ended.</p> \n<p>With much of the US still in lockdown, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee has been forced <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/17/joe-biden-presidential-campaign-online-lockdown-coronavirus\">to take his campaign to unseat Donald Trump online</a>. It has not always been easy.</p> \n<p>His campaign\u2019s first attempt to recreate a traditional rally \u2013 part of a virtual swing through the battleground state of Florida \u2013 was later described by his opponents as an \u201cunmitigated technological failure\u201d. The video stream was glitchy and pixelated. The audio was choppy, rendering some remarks nearly incomprehensible. And there were lengthy delays between speakers and at one point, the feed went dark for several minutes.</p> \n<p>\u201cAm I on?\u201d asked Biden, beaming into the telecast from his home in Wilmington, Delaware, where he has been isolated since the middle of March. An off-camera voice replied that he was. Biden removed a pair of aviator sunglasses as he walked toward the camera.</p> \n<p>\u201cGood evening, Tampa. Thanks so much for tuning in,\u201d he continued, a hint of irritation in his voice. \u201cI wish we could have done this together \u2013 and it had gone a little more smoothly.\u201d</p> \n<p>For nearly two months, Biden has been the test subject in a novel political experiment: running for president in the age of Covid-19.</p> \n<p>Social distancing restrictions imposed to stop the spread of the virus have already starved the campaign of a victory tour to mark his ascent to the Democratic nomination. It may well deny Democrats the chance to formally nominate him in person at the party\u2019s national convention this summer. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/14/barack-obama-endorse-joe-biden-2020-election-democrats\">Endorsements from former rivals and party leaders </a>occur online to varying degrees of fanfare. . The remote set-up, anathema to Biden\u2019s back-slapping, glad-handing approach to politics, has left the candidate walled off from voters and competing for visibility.</p> \n<p>Yet, technical difficulties aside, his campaign of confinement seems to be working.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"afcfad2a2846b6e42514bb7dd410dca7e6fa02ea\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/afcfad2a2846b6e42514bb7dd410dca7e6fa02ea/88_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton at a virtual town hall during which she endorsed him last month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton at a virtual town hall during which she endorsed him last month.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Biden Presidential Campaign HANDOUT/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In recent weeks, Biden has <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/us/general_election_trump_vs_biden-6247.html\">widened </a>his lead over Trump as the president\u2019s support slips amid <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/coronavirus-polls/\">growing disapproval</a> of his response to the pandemic. Surveys from Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Florida, North Carolina and Arizona \u2013 key battlegrounds that Trump won in 2016 \u2013 show Biden ahead. At a recent virtual fundraiser last week, Jennifer O\u2019Malley Dillon, his new campaign manager, expressed optimism about Biden\u2019s prospects in Florida and Arizona.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe natural state of this race is to be a referendum on Donald Trump and every time Donald Trump steps to the microphone he hurts himself,\u201d said Mark Mellman, a veteran Democratic pollster. \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty good position for Joe Biden to be in.\u201d</p> \n<p>Biden initially struggled to adapt to his cloistered reality. In March, the campaign turned a recreation room in the basement of his home into a studio, though not fast enough for his critics, who launched a \u201cWhere\u2019s Joe\u201d campaign to mark the candidate\u2019s relative disappearance from the national stage.</p> \n<p>But since then, Biden has been busy. Nearly every day he makes appearances on local TV news channels or national talkshows. He launched a podcast, where he has hosted conversations with prominent Democratic governors and potential vice-presidential candidates. He spends time each day speaking with a voter \u2013 a frontline worker, campaign volunteers \u2013 and he participated in what the campaign billed as a \u201cvirtual rope line\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cSo what\u2019s up?\u201d he <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdxMuFBihZM\">said</a> to Ashley Ruiz of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, one of several voters on the rope line. \u201cTell me about your situation, Ash.\u201d</p> \n<p><strong>\u2022\u2022\u2022</strong></p> \n<p>Biden\u2019s rise in the polls comes as he contends with an allegation from Tara Reade, a former aide in his Senate office who accused him of sexual assault in 1993. In an interview this week with Megyn Kelly, the former Fox News and NBC television host, Reade said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/07/tara-reade-megyn-kelly-interview-joe-biden-drop-out\">he should withdraw from the presidential race</a>.</p> \n<p>Biden has forcefully denied the allegation. \u201cIt\u2019s not true, I am saying unequivocally. It never, never happened,\u201d he said last week, in an interview addressing her claim for the first time publicly.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/02/joe-biden-tara-reade-allegations-metoo-trump\">Democrats' downplaying of the Biden allegations will damage #MeToo | Arwa Mahdawi</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Publicly, Democrats, including prominent #MeToo advocates, have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/03/gretchen-whitmer-backs-joe-biden-sexual-assault\">rallied around Biden</a>, though privately some in the party have expressed concern about the continuous drip of reporting on the matter.</p> \n<p>So far the allegation appears to have marginally dented his reputation, but not his lead. Most voters \u2013 86% \u2013 are aware of the allegation, according to a Monmouth poll, which found the electorate divided over whether they viewed the claim as credible. At the same time, the poll showed Biden nine points ahead of Trump.</p> \n<p>Despite Trump\u2019s falling electoral fortunes, many Democrats remain anxious about Biden\u2019s position \u2013 and his strategy.</p> \n<p>David Axelrod and David Plouffe, two of Barack Obama\u2019s top campaign strategists, implored Biden\u2019s campaign to expand its digital footprint in a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/04/opinion/axelrod-plouffe-joe-biden.html\">joint New York Times op-ed</a> that compared the atmospherics of the candidate\u2019s home videos<strong> </strong>to \u201can astronaut beaming back to earth from the International Space Station\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cOnline speeches from his basement won\u2019t cut it,\u201d they wrote.</p> \n<p>Lis Smith, the former top adviser to Pete Buttigieg\u2019s presidential campaign, followed with an<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/opinion/joe-biden-trump-2020.html?smtyp=cur&amp;smid=tw-nytopinion\"> op-ed on Thursday</a> that offered a blueprint for turning Biden into the \u201chottest bad boy and disrupter in the media game\u201d. She suggested his campaign use TV appearances and digital content to highlight Biden\u2019s empathy, a trait even supporters say the president has lacked in response to the rising coronavirus death toll.</p> \n<p>Part of the campaign\u2019s evolving digital strategy includes partnering with groups that already have an online presence, like <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/JoeMamas2020\">JoeMamas2020</a>, a national coalition of \u201cmoms, caregivers, moms to be, aunts &amp; all the parental figures in between\u201d with about 27,000 Facebook and 1,200 Twitter followers. The group has helped amplify Biden\u2019s appearances and policy proposals while spreading the word about upcoming events.</p> \n<p>Julie Zebrak, the group\u2019s co-founder, said the online army is growing with women energized to help elect a candidate who promises to restore stability and calm after four years of what Trump\u2019s critics view as chaos and controversy.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe are all extremely enthusiastic for Joe Biden to beat Donald Trump,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>Yet the same traits that endear Biden to a growing coalition of suburban women and Never Trump Republicans have largely failed to excite younger, progressive voters. It\u2019s not that they prefer Trump \u2013 they don\u2019t \u2013 but a lack of enthusiasm among those voters could spell trouble in November if they stay home or vote for a third-party candidate.</p> \n<p>The campaign has also ramped up its outreach to young people, who overwhelmingly supported Biden\u2019s rival Bernie Sanders. On Friday, Biden presented his economic pitch in an appearance on NowThis, a social-media-heavy news outlet with a young, progressive audience.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis crisis hit harder and will last longer because Donald Trump spent the last three years undermining the core pillars of our economic strength,\u201d Biden <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/NowThisPolitics/videos/278343589989804\">said</a> in remarks that attacked Trump\u2019s stimulus efforts a kind of \u201ccronyism\u201d and corporate welfare. Before he began speaking, Biden removed a face mask, a pointed rebuke of the president who had refused to wear one.</p> \n<p>Still, new <a href=\"https://nextgenamerica.org/research/\">research</a> conducted on behalf of NextGen America found many young people weren\u2019t convinced Biden\u2019s policies meet the scale of the challenges bearing down on their generation.</p> \n<p>This makes the efforts of groups like Progressive Turnout Project, which endorsed him this week, all the more important. In the coming months, the group is investing more than $52m to turn out low-propensity Democratic voters \u2013 including young people and people of color \u2013 in 17 key battleground states.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe best thing we can do is go and knock on doors and have face-to-face conversations with voters,\u201d said Alex Morgan, the group\u2019s executive director. \u201cWe are still looking to do that. But it\u2019ll be knocking on that door and then taking a few big steps back and having a more distant conversation.\u201d</p> \n<p><strong>\u2022\u2022\u2022</strong></p> \n<p>Biden\u2019s campaign also faces another looming threat. The Michigan congressman Justin Amash, who left the Republican party last year after voting to impeach Trump, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/03/justin-amash-libertarian-2020-election-trump-win-critics\">recently announced</a> that he would seek the Libertarian party nomination.</p> \n<p>His entrance has alarmed Democrats, who fear he could siphon off Never Trump voters who might otherwise back Biden, particularly in Amash\u2019s home state of Michigan, where third-party candidates pulled away a combined 5% of the vote share in 2016. Hillary Clinton lost the state by just 10,704 votes, less than 0.25%.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"65f2635a13f2d6e816e814bead1ccc1686037e92\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/65f2635a13f2d6e816e814bead1ccc1686037e92/0_19_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barack Obama endorses Biden via video message in mid-April.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barack Obama endorses Biden via video message in mid-April.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Cahn/Zuma Wire/Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Many Democrats believe Biden\u2019s fate may well rest on his ability to persuade their own side to vote.</p> \n<p>\u201cTrump has shown no desire or ability to moderate for those swing voters in this election,\u201d said Addisu Demissie, who served as Cory Booker\u2019s presidential campaign manager. \u201cSo those voters are now likely going to end up either Biden voters or non-voters or third-party voters, and that\u2019s the competition.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/03/justin-amash-libertarian-2020-election-trump-win-critics\">'Are you a spoiler?': why critics fear Amash's Libertarian bid may ensure a Trump win</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>This week, Trump traveled to the battleground state of Arizona, where he toured a medical mask facility without wearing one himself. The visit was a symbolic show of his administration\u2019s push to reopen the US economy but there were unmistakable elements of his signature campaign rallies, including the music that played when Trump finished his remarks (the Rolling Stones\u2019 You Can\u2019t Always Get What You Want).</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s cross-country venture stood in striking contrast to Biden\u2019s virtual swing through Florida \u2013 which included a rally, a roundtable in Jacksonville and an appearance on the local news in Tampa. The technical glitches only further highlighted the limitations of his confinement.</p> \n<p>But the coronavirus has also upended Trump\u2019s strategy, erasing the booming economy he has made a centerpiece of his re-election campaign. In recent weeks, his campaign has all but abandoned championing the president\u2019s leadership, instead focusing its efforts on diminishing Biden.</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Brad Parscale, previewed the onslaught on Twitter this week, comparing the Trump re-election juggernaut to the Death Star from the Star Wars movies. \u201cIn a few days we start pressing FIRE for the first time,\u201d he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/parscale/status/1258388669544759296\">wrote</a>.</p> \n<p>As Trump prepares to make even greater use of the advantages of incumbency, Biden faces his biggest test yet.

He ran against his friend Madison for Congress to reaffirm a principle, \u201ca heartfelt belief that a new American government was not American without safeguarding the rights of its citizens. Politicians rarely think this way now or in 1788, but Monroe did.\u201d</p> <p>Aspects of Monroe\u2019s presidency are surprisingly modern. He began by following Washington\u2019s example of making a tour of the country, garnering political capital for the changes in national policy he sought, seeking (and mostly succeeding, for a time) to unite Republicans and Federalists in a common cause.

It did not. In the aftermath of the Panic of 1819, he proposed relief for land purchasers, as \u201cthe purchases were made when the price of every article had risen to its greatest height, and that the installments are due at a period of great depression.\u201d He championed defence, military preparedness and even the beginnings of international relief, requesting $50,000 from Congress to send to Caracas after an earthquake.</p> <p>There are more direct parallels with our own day.

  "<p>A defiant tyrant and his ruthless wife square up against the family oligarch, with the spoils of a nation at stake. It could be standard Ramadan television fare, but not this year. Instead, all the intrigue of Syria\u2019s ruling family has been laid out in a spectacular real-life drama that has gripped the country and the region.</p> <p>Leading the cast is the Syrian leader, Bashar al-Assad, and Syria\u2019s first lady, Asma al-Assad, but star billing has so far been taken by the president\u2019s first cousin, Rami Makhlouf, who last week took to Facebook to do the unthinkable: air the normally inscrutable family\u2019s dirty laundry.</p> <p>Makhlouf, Syria\u2019s most powerful tycoon and its richest man throughout Assad\u2019s 20-year reign, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/03/syria-richest-man-inflames-rare-public-dispute-bashar-al-assad-rami-makhlouf\">complained</a> that his cousin was sending secret police to seize his assets and shutter his businesses. In doing so, he laid bare a power struggle that now threatens the very existence of the Syrian regime, sparking a fissure in the ruling Alawite sect, and leaving regular Syrians aghast.</p> <p>Without a hint of irony, Makhlouf boasted of bankrolling Syria\u2019s infamous security forces, who have tortured and disappeared thousands of people in nine years of war, then complained that his employees had been treated in \u201can inhumane way\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Makhlouf\u2019s bold statements have led supporters and foes to suggest that Russia is sponsoring the discord</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe were all shocked at that,\u201d said Monir Nabilsi, a lawyer from northern Syria. \u201cEven my Alawite friends. Though his tone was reverential to Bashar, his words had meaning. He and the Makhloufs ran the finances of the country, while the Assads ran politics and security. That was the pact. Now what?\u201d</p> <p>Makhlouf\u2019s two videos were widely mocked for a tone lacking in awareness and content that bordered on parody. But in the days since, more public statements from powerful Syrians have cast the appearances in a different light. One, Firas Tlass, the son of a former defence minister, appeared on the Moscow-owned TV network Russia Today to confirm that Makhlouf was directly taking on the president\u2019s wife and brother, Maher.</p> <p>\u201cHe repeatedly tells Bashar not to let \u2018others\u2019 squander the money as they\u2019re for the poor,\u201d said Tlass. \u201cBy others he meant Asma and Maher. Rami\u2019s words managed to cause a rift within Assad supporters. They still all support the regime but some are supporting Rami questioning why the president is doing this to his cousin. This is unprecedented.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"54e79d1ae88b7fa3e7dc15bcf1ae0d1413e3ee18\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/54e79d1ae88b7fa3e7dc15bcf1ae0d1413e3ee18/50_0_1500_900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rami Makhlouf\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rami Makhlouf took to Facebook to air the normally inscrutable family\u2019s dirty laundry.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Facebook</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Makhlouf\u2019s bold statements and Tlass\u2019s candour have led supporters and foes of the regime to suggest that Russia, a prominent stakeholder in Syria and nominally a supporter of Assad, is sponsoring the discord. In the weeks before Makhlouf appeared, Russian officials spoke of their disappointment with the Syrian leader, with two former diplomats suggesting he had made few moves towards a political solution \u2013 a prerequisite to the cash cow of reconstruction, which Moscow has long awaited. The diplomats also lamented the performance of the Syrian army on the battlefield, claiming Assad had largely been saved from defeat by 25 Russian jets.</p> <p>On Friday, Assad supporters pushed back, questioning the effectiveness of Russian-supplied anti-aircraft missiles that have done nothing to stop frequent Israeli attacks on Iranian targets inside Syria. Social media posts by Assad backers complained that Vladimir Putin imposed political solutions on Syria but sent little food aid.</p> <p>\u201cAssad has managed to create an army of Assadists,\u201d said Tlass. \u201cThey\u2019re not only Alawites, they\u2019re from every sect. It is a very scary fact.\u201d</p> <p>Across Syria, divining truths from the extraordinary drama has become a pastime during the holy month, in which observant Muslims fast during daylight hours and often feast at night. Makhlouf\u2019s whereabouts have been central to guessing games. Members of his family suggest he is taking refuge on the coastline near his ancestral village of Bustan al-Basha. Suggestions earlier in the week that Assad had arrested his cousin were unfounded.</p> <p>\u201cEven so, he has put his wife \u2013 a trained investment banker \u2013 up against him,\u201d said one member of the Alawite clan, living in exile outside Syria. \u201cWhoever backs down now loses. It\u2019s a big thing for Bashar to do and an even bigger turning for Rami. Bashar wants the keys to the treasury. But he has to take on the Makhloufs and Putin to get them.\u201d</p> <p>To many, the real-life House of Assad is proving just as remarkable as the imaginary version speculated about in secret over decades. \u201cThere are shakedowns, mistresses, assassinations, and palace intrigue,\u201d said Fadi Nourallah, an industrialist from Aleppo living in southern Turkey. \u201cEverything we thought might be true is true, and more.\u201d</p> <p>Some, including Tlass, see the current machinations as a potential precursor for a changing of the guard, something that Russia has remained determined to avoid through the war \u2013 particularly since it formally joined the fray in September 2015.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/03/syria-richest-man-inflames-rare-public-dispute-bashar-al-assad-rami-makhlouf\">Syria's richest man inflames rare public dispute with Assad</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThose who say there is no alternative to Assad obviously just want him to remain in power,\u201d said Tlass. \u201cRussia is the one in power here, it can create a group of five army generals to oversee an election for a transitory government whenever it wants.\u201d</p> <p>Even so, risking yet more instability that would likely follow from a change of power is something Russia seems unwilling to do. In the meantime, the three-way game of brinkmanship between Assad, Makhlouf and maybe Russia is nearing new ground. </p> <p>\u201cThe Assad-Makhlouf families do not care about rebuilding Syria. They want to wear everyone out and remain in power,\u201d said Tlass. \u201cThere is no political life in Syria; there is only command and obey.\u201d</p>",

According to Virendra Singh, the 22-year-old who was the only one of the group who survived, they had presumed that because trains had been stopped during lockdown, it would be safe to briefly rest on the tracks. They were run over at 5:15am on Friday morning by a train travelling from Mumbai.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe wanted to go back to our village as for the past month and a half there was no work and no money,\u201d said Singh. \u201cWe had started walking at 7pm on Thursday and at 4am everyone\u2019s legs were in pain, and so we took a rest on the tracks. When I heard the train sound from the distance I screamed at them to move, but they were asleep and did not hear, and the train mowed them over.\u201d The train tracks were left littered with the meagre possessions they were carrying, including battered shoes and the few <em>roti </em>they were surviving on.</p> \n  <p>India\u2019s lockdown of its 1.3bn people has been described as one of the largest and harshest in the world, depriving the 80% of India\u2019s workforce who work in the informal sector of a way of earning a living.

He and two of his brothers convicted of embezzlement had been placed in Hall 2 of Wing 4 of the prison on their return as part of a supposed 14-day quarantine.</p> \n  <p>But he was taken away on Tuesday to hospital and his brother on Thursday confirmed that he had been tested positive.

She is waiting to hear if she will be granted clemency or instead returned to jail. Her husband Richard Ratcliffe has asked the UK ambassador to Tehran to visit her in an act of solidarity.</p> \n  <p>Tehran itself was hit by 5.1 earthquake on Thursday night, leading to civilians to rush into the streets for safety.
