  "<p>Andrew Gillum\u2019s career as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/aug/29/andrew-gillum-progressive-vying-to-be-florida-first-black-governor\">rising star of the Democratic left</a> looked to be in jeopardy on Saturday as retweets from Donald Trump fueled the fire of an episode in which the politician was found by police in a hotel room with a male escort who was treated for an apparent drug overdose.</p> <p>Gillum, a progressive former Tallahassee mayor who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/nov/07/andrew-gillum-fails-florida-first-black-governor-ron-desantis\">narrowly lost a 2018 run to be Florida\u2019s governor</a>, apologized for being too intoxicated to talk to officers at the Mondrian South Beach hotel in Miami early on Friday, after police were called to a \u201cmedical incident\u201d.</p> <p>A police report said Gillum, 40, was discovered throwing up in a bathroom and his companion, Travis Dyson, 30, received CPR from paramedics in the room where the officers also found three bags of presumed crystal methamphetamine.</p> <p>No charges were filed and Gillum, who joined CNN as a political analyst after his election defeat, released a statement in which he said he had too much to drink at a wedding reception and thanked first responders. He asked for privacy, to spend time with his wife and three young children.</p> <p>Trump, however, was keen to not let the story fade away. Between Friday afternoon and Saturday morning the president promoted three tweets by the conservative commentators <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RealCandaceO\">Candace Owens</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/larryelder\">Larry Elder</a>, all mocking Gillum.</p> <p>In <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1238797759161008128\">another tweet</a> on Saturday, Trump, who engaged in a<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2018/10/30/gillum-responds-trump-attacks-947976\"> war of words</a> with Gillum during the 2018 elections and branded him \u201c<a href=\"https://miamiherald.typepad.com/nakedpolitics/2018/10/andrew-gillum-is-a-stone-cold-thief-trump-said-on-fox-news-last-night.html\">a stone cold thief</a>\u201d for allegedly accepting free theater tickets, praised Owens as \u201cgreat\u201d.</p> <p>Owens was first to reveal the Gillum story in a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RealCandaceO/status/1238466426127564800\">series of tweets</a> on Friday morning that contained information and assertions about the circumstances of the incident and the individuals involved that were not contained in the <a href=\"https://tallahasseereports.com/2020/03/13/breaking-andrew-gillum-named-in-miami-beach-police-report/\">police report</a>.</p> <p>According to that report, paramedics were called by a third man, named as Aldo Mejias, who provided the credit card Dyson used to book the room. Mejias told officers that when he arrived he saw Dyson collapsing on to the bed and saw Gillum vomiting in the bathroom.</p> <p>Dyson, 30, whose profile on a male escort website was deleted on Friday afternoon, was taken to Miami\u2019s Mount Sinai hospital in a stable condition, the report said.</p> <p>Officers \u201cattempted to speak to Mr Gillum [but] Mr Gillum was unable to communicate with officers due to his inebriated state\u201d. Later, the report said, \u201cGillum left the hotel room and returned to his residence without incident\u201d after a welfare check.</p> <p>Miami Beach police spokesman Ernesto Rodriguez <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/article241165641.html\">told the Miami Herald</a> that though the suspected drugs were in plain sight, no arrests were made because \u201cno one was in physical possession of those narcotics\u201d.</p> <p>In his statement, Gillum said: \u201cI was in Miami last night for a wedding celebration when first responders were called to assist one of my friends. While I had too much to drink, I want to be clear that I have never used methamphetamines.</p> <p>\u201cI apologize to the people of Florida for the distraction this has caused our movement,\u201d he added, referring to <a href=\"https://www.forwardfla.com/\">Forward Florida Action</a>, a voter registration advocacy group he founded to boost Democratic efforts to beat Trump in November.</p>",
  "<p>Joe Root has outlined how the decision to abandon England\u2019s tour of Sri Lanka was driven more by the unsettling effect of the coronavirus pandemic on his squad than the advice of the experts.</p> <p>As sporting events around the globe were cancelled in swift succession on Friday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/13/england-cricket-tour-of-sri-lanka-called-off-due-to-coronavirus\" title=\"\">cricket fell into line</a> to the relief of the England players. The immediate risk may have been minimal since there have been three confirmed cases in Sri Lanka, though that risk may have escalated with the arrival of 3,000 English fans, heading for Galle for the first Test, which was scheduled to start on Thursday.</p> <p>Root was refreshingly candid with PA Media news agency before his flight back to the UK. \u201cThere was an element of relief,\u201d he said. \u201cThe right decision has been made. You could see looking at the players that their minds were elsewhere thinking about people back home. Now that we can go and look after families and be with loved ones that\u2019s put a lot of guys at ease.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/13/england-cricket-tour-of-sri-lanka-called-off-due-to-coronavirus\">England cricket tour of Sri Lanka called off due to coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cNaturally there was a lot of talk in the dressing room and it got to a stage where it overshadowed the cricket. Looking at how quickly things have happened at home, you\u2019re thinking about family and friends who might be a bit more vulnerable and that\u2019s hard when you\u2019re a long way away. It was clear it was getting in the way of performance and affecting the mental wellbeing of the guys.\u201d</p> <p>There were also concerns within the squad about the implications of testing positive and the subsequent necessity of being put into quarantine away from the team environment. The idea of being stranded a long way from home is currently unappealing to all travellers and England cricketers were no exception.</p> <p>\u201cThere were a number of different scenarios we could have found ourselves in that were pretty scary to be honest,\u201d Root said. \u201cYou think how things might have gone \u2013 being in isolation here, disconnected from the team, without the security we would usually have around us at the ground or the hotel. If one of the lads was to get it in these conditions, or a member of the public travelling, it could be quite a scary experience.\u201d</p> <p>So the team heads home after a bizarre few months. In South Africa, the squad was hindered by a virulent bug at the start of the tour but in the end they prevailed. But there was no way this virus could be defeated.</p> <p>Root has no better idea than anyone else when the team will reconvene. \u201cWe don\u2019t know when we\u2019ll play again. I suppose you can\u2019t have mass gatherings so there won\u2019t be many training camps. I\u2019m sure over the coming weeks we\u2019ll prepare and do everything we can to be as ready as possible but until we know more it\u2019s just a case of common sense. Look after yourself, condition well and be ready to start.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The rugby authorities have an important decision to make because I look at the outcomes of this week\u2019s various disciplinary hearings and it leads me to one key question: What is more important \u2013 the health and safety of the players or the game\u2019s image? In the past few days we\u2019ve seen a three-week ban for a punch to the face, four weeks for nearly taking someone\u2019s head off, nothing for a coach calling the referee a cheat and 10 weeks for Joe Marler \u2013 an incident that looks bad but contained no malice at all.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/09/joe-marler-cited-over-grabbing-alan-wyn-jones-groin-england-wales-six-nations\">Joe Marler faces season-ending ban for grabbing Jones' groin in Wales game</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is just one of many paradoxes that exist in rugby. As someone who is entrenched in the sport, I can look at the Mohamed Haouas punch and understand how the disciplinary hearing reached a verdict of three weeks because I know how these things work and I\u2019ve seen plenty of similar cases.</p> <p>The same goes for Manu Tuilagi\u2019s red card and I understand that once Marler had been cited in the way that he was, he was facing a long ban if found guilty. But that level of inconsistency is alarming and your average \u201cRugby Flirt\u201d, someone who watches a few England matches a year, will not get it at all. I remember after England beat Ireland last year, trying to explain how a pass from Henry Slade that travelled forward three metres was actually legal in a sport where the laws state you have to pass backwards.</p> <p>Part of the problem is that common sense just is not very common when it comes to disciplinary issues. The laws can be so rigid that there just isn\u2019t any breathing space for anyone trying to make sense of what has happened and it is important to remember that if players, fans and referees can all be influenced by social media then so can disciplinary officers.</p> <p>Indeed, social media means that players effectively have two trials and the social media hearing effectively determines whether an actual one takes place. Let\u2019s take the Marler incident, I can almost guarantee that 10 years ago that would not go to a hearing because it would not be clipped up and all over Twitter immediately. I also believe that the TMO would have seen it at the time but I think that sometimes the referees protect themselves from making decisions.</p> <p>In the Marler case, it was such a unique situation, imagine Ben O\u2019Keeffe being in the middle of Twickenham with 80,000 around him and trying to make sense of what has happened. You could argue that referees are paid to make those decisions but I think a fundamental point in this is just how many people\u2019s attitudes will have changed in the days since the incident happened. I would ask anyone who watched the game, what decision would they have made on the spot and has that changed over the last few days?</p> <p>It\u2019s important for me to acknowledge that I\u2019ve known Joe for nearly 20 years, but my overriding view of the matter is that I don\u2019t have a strong opinion on it one way or the other. In this day and age it seems that you either have to be outraged by what Joe did or laud him. There doesn\u2019t seem to be any middle ground any more. The social media age that we live in means you have to be at one extreme or another but with regards to this incident I\u2019m somewhere in between. I\u2019m not applauding Joe and I\u2019m not patting him on the back for it.</p> <p>He\u2019s terrific bloke, a unique character and a hugely unique sense of humour. Loads of people have appreciated that and lauded him for it but times he can overstep the mark and get it wrong. In that situation he\u2019s got it wrong but was there any malice? Any intent to hurt or harm Alun Wyn Jones? Absolutely not. In his mind he\u2019s being playful, childish, petulant \u2013 whatever you want to call it. He\u2019s brought a spark to a rugby world that is forever getting sanitised but that\u2019s not to condone in any way what he did.</p> <p>I\u2019ve heard the argument that \u201cthese things happen\u201d a lot but if we want to grow the game, get to new audiences, new territories and have more eyeballs there\u2019s a greater responsibility among players. I think to say, \u201cthese things happen\u201d is a bit amateur. Those days are gone. There are a lot of things that used to happen on the rugby pitch which we would just accept but they just can\u2019t happen any more. And the authorities have decided that these things need to be in the past now. We just can\u2019t have it because we want a global reach and a diverse demographic. With the extra revenue there is an extra responsibility for your actions.</p> <p>The final point on the subject I need to make is that I find some of the abuse directed at Joe on social media has been disgraceful. Unfortunately, we live in 2020 and it does not surprise me in the slightest. But it was only a matter of weeks ago that #BeKind was trending and to me it feels like those who were outraged and disgusted then are guilty of behaving in that manner now. In Joe\u2019s case #BeKind has undoubtedly gone out the window.</p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s Oval Office address on coronavirus was terrifying because it revealed a man completely unmatched to the moment. Even though he was reading from a teleprompter, the president got the details of his major policy announcements wrong. He attempted no emotional connection with or comfort of the tens of millions of Americans whose lives are being upended by the threat of the disease. He didn\u2019t even have anything useful to say about what his own top scientist has described as America\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/coronavirus-us-testing-failures-trump-administration\">failing</a>\u201d testing regime, which has screened about as many people all year as South Korea does in a day. In a presidency accustomed to lows, this one was quite literally sickening.</p> \n<p>Trump had an unusual deer-in-the-headlights quality during his address, seeming to reveal that even he realizes his lie-and-deny operation cannot last for much longer. His allies in the media are busy trying to downplay the virus, but anyone who switches over to a real news channel can see what is happening in Italy, where doctors feel forced to leave the elderly to die and hospitals are struggling to bury the dead. With estimates of the number of Americans who might require intensive care <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.nl/presentation-us-hospitals-preparing-for-millions-of-hospitalizations-2020-3?international=true&amp;r=US\">running into the millions</a> and only about 45,000 ICU beds <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/upshot/coronavirus-biggest-worry-hospital-capacity.html\">available</a> in the US, similar scenes might soon be playing out at home.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-donald-trump-presidency-sick-joke\">The sick joke of Donald Trump's presidency isn't funny any more | Richard Wolffe</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>When Trump and his allies can no longer lie or deny, we can expect them to move on to the next phase of their crisis management playbook: attacking their enemies. It is already clear that they intend to interpret the virus not primarily as an existential threat to millions of Americans, but as an existential threat to their own political power. With the markets tumbling and Trump\u2019s re-election suddenly in doubt, it is only a matter of time before the right goes on the offensive. When they do, it won\u2019t be the virus in their sights, but the familiar foes: journalists, experts, blue states, immigrants and people of color.</p> \n<p>At this point, the coronavirus pandemic will intersect with Trump\u2019s authoritarian impulses in truly frightening ways. With parts of the country experiencing levels of privation and death rarely seen in peacetime, Trump will feel justified in invoking emergency powers. In a declared state of emergency, the president has <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/01/presidential-emergency-powers/576418/\">extraordinary powers</a>, including the ability to freeze an American\u2019s finances and deprive them of the ability to legally work, to control digital communications, and to deploy the military domestically. Aside from these enumerated items, Trump has repeatedly shown that he anyway believes that there are no legal or constitutional limits on presidential authority.</p> \n<p>Most worrying of all are the implications for immigrant communities and people of color. Trump has repeatedly demonstrated that he has a racialized view of who is a \u201ctrue\u201d American, from denying Barack Obama\u2019s citizenship to telling congresswomen of color born in the US to \u201cgo back\u201d to where \u201cthey came\u201d from. It would be extraordinary if this doesn\u2019t at the very least color his decisions on where to send federal aid and how to deploy his emergency powers. There is also a disturbing likelihood that Trump will attempt to stoke racism in order to rally his base and present the coronavirus as an alien plot against (white) America.</p> \n<p>Already the right has shown a tendency to lash out at foreigners in its response to the virus, from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/10/republicans-face-backlash-racist-labeling-coronavirus-china-wuhan\">insisting on labeling it</a> \u201cWuhan coronavirus\u201d to carrying out border closures while doing little to stop transmission within the United States. In a bizarre statement, Senator Tom Cotton even <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/hold-accountable-those-who-inflicted-it-on-the-world-tom-cotton-demands-punishment-for-coronavirus-outbreak\">threatened</a> to \u201chold accountable those who inflicted it on the world\u201d. Once the virus is undeniably established in America, it is all too likely that this animus and psychological need for scapegoats will be directed at those the right considers alien interlopers at home. The results \u2013 both from the misuse of state power, and from privately \u2013 inflicted terrorism and violence \u2013 could be profound.</p> \n<p>It is also time to start worrying about the 2020 election. If the economy has crashed, there are countless dead, and Trump is badly trailing in the polls, it is almost inevitable that he will attempt to cast doubt on the wisdom and legitimacy of holding a November election. He would not have to do anything so drastic as to attempt to call off the election \u2013 instead, he could call for his supporters to boycott it, then simply refuse to acknowledge the result. If the Republican party faces an electoral wipeout, its craven behavior over the last few years can give us no confidence that the party would defend the democratic process and eject Trump from the White House.</p> \n<p>In short, nothing in Trump\u2019s record \u2013 or that of his ardent base, whose political support is all he cares about \u2013 can lead us to believe that he will use his power to protect and serve all Americans equally in a time of unprecedented crisis. He might look like a deer in the headlights right now, but soon enough he will snap back to the unreality he lives in and deploy the only political trick he knows: rallying his base, abusing his power, trashing his foes. Many Americans will have to deal with the reality of a president who is not only incompetent to defend them but doesn\u2019t even regard them as legitimate Americans worthy of protection. This epidemiological crisis is also a political one. We should prepare to defend against both.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Andrew Gawthorpe is a historian of the United States at Leiden University</p></li> \n</ul>",
  "<p>When Brexit and Trump sent transatlantic politics into a spin in 2016, many searched frantically for a handrail in the darkness. The times demanded fresh perspectives \u2013 and they appeared in the shape of political podcasting. As a medium, the podcast was poised for adaptation, offering a range of furious, original, funny, marginalised and independent voices when the political going got weird.</p> <p>Suddenly, everything was up for grabs: if Donald Trump could enter the Oval Office, surely nothing was off the table? Could a socialist become US president? The Bernie Sanders ultras on the self-proclaimed \u201cdirtbag left\u201d certainly thought so. Pods such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jun/03/chapo-trap-house-podcast-interview-trump-socialist-us-comics\">Chapo Trap House</a> and <a href=\"https://redscarepodcast.libsyn.com/\">Red Scare</a> \u2013 a mix of radical politics and irony \u2013 found sizeable niches, using abrasive humour to tap into a disaffection not represented by mainstream broadcasters.

They are big business too: tours and book tie-ins underpin the business model of the likes of Chapo. Crowdfunding platforms such as Patreon, which enable fans to support their favourite pods and unlock extra tiers of content as a reward, have made independent profitability possible. Crooked Media, which hosts multiple shows alongside <a href=\"https://crooked.com/podcast-series/pod-save-america/\">Pod Save America</a>, is arguably becoming a new media empire.</p> <p>The UK has followed suit. Pods ranging from <a href=\"https://trashfuturepodcast.podbean.com/\">Trashfuture</a> (a response to the \u201ccontinuing psychic trauma of capitalism\u201d) to Novara Media\u2019s <a href=\"https://novaramedia.com/category/audio/tyskysour/\">Tysky</a><a href=\"https://novaramedia.com/category/audio/tyskysour/\">Sour</a> have extolled the virtues of Corbynism. <a href=\"https://audioboom.com/channel/remainiacs-podcast\">The Remainiacs</a> podcast (centrists who suddenly found themselves on the outside looking in) and their second, less Brexit-focused spin-off The Bunker, have become the voice of despairing liberalism. On the right, there is the podcast arm of online magazine Spiked (which recently interviewed privilege-denying thesp Laurence Fox) and The Delingpod, in which journalist James Delingpole does his tendentious, climate crisis-sceptic thing in surround sound.</p> <p>The much-mocked \u201cmainstream media\u201d has responded with pods of its own, in the process often making it clear why their competitors had to happen in the first place. The BBC\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04z203l/episodes/downloads\">Political Thinking </a><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04z203l/episodes/downloads\">With Nick Robinson</a> boasts titles suggesting the least appetising Friends episodes ever (The Nicky Morgan One; The What Does Boris Johnson Really Think One) and actually uses its extended duration as an excuse to get even cosier still with prominent politicians. These pods don\u2019t exactly go out of their way to dispel the notion that conventional political journalism is frequently a self-perpetuating Human Centipede of quid pro quo banality.</p> <p>Conversely, the success of independent political podcasting is in large part due to the energy generated by outsiders grabbing a platform without permission. Political podcasts thrive on insurgency, on opposition to jaded official voices. \u201cUnmediated, unscripted, direct and authentic content is hugely appealing,\u201d says Dr Lance Dann, who co-wrote <a href=\"https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/podcasting-9781501328688/\">Podcasting: The Audio Media Revolution</a> with fellow academic Dr Martin Spinelli. \u201cIt\u2019s a raw energy and anger that people can express in the moment.\u201d The traditional media has struggled with balance, so in the face of the absurdity of Trump, Johnson and Brexit, these unguarded and incredulous voices have felt not just refreshing but necessary.</p> <p>In fact, the unashamed lack of balance is part of the fun. In an era of correspondents parroting the briefings of anonymous government sources, they feel honest: vigorously and proudly partial. If you are starting to doubt official versions of the truth, it is thrilling to find you\u2019re not alone. \u201cThe form itself is incredibly free,\u201d says Spinelli. \u201cThere are no gatekeepers, there are no rules, the fear of defamation is virtually nonexistent, and podcasters have been experimenting in developing relationships with their audiences based on these attributes. That\u2019s a key point: podcasting is really about a relationship rather than the spoken word.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9ff4d437fbe667d0e7469af612b6a8f14fee0094\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ff4d437fbe667d0e7469af612b6a8f14fee0094/0_6_1654_992/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Podcast\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>But relationships can become too cosy, and insurgency can curdle into isolationism. Jessa Crispin, whose <a href=\"https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/forever-dog-podcast-network/public-intellectual\">Public Intellectual podcast</a> in the US explores a variety of outlooks, recently hosted an episode whose title suggested that <a href=\"https://player.fm/series/public-intellectual-2379837/you-can-talk-to-a-conservative-like-a-normal-human-being-with-gerald-russello\">You Can Talk to a Conservative Like a Normal Human Being</a>. It was a reaction to a consensus in which, she says, \u201caudiences are mostly looking for a podcast that agrees with what they already believe\u201d. These podcasts\u2019 hosts, she adds, try \u201cto turn everything into a punchline. Everyone is trying to follow the Chapo model; guys shouting over one another, eager to make the best joke. If I wanted to listen to men from privileged backgrounds who think they know best about everything, I\u2019d turn on the cable news.\u201d</p> <p>In fact, one of the most notable problems with some of the \u201cdirtbag left\u201d pods is how light on policy discussion they have become. Rather than being a meaningful part of a battle of ideas, they can sometimes feel like hipsterism manifesting as political punditry, what Sigmund Freud called \u201cthe narcissism of small differences\u201d rendered streamable. Some of the hard-left podcasts often seem more animated by their loathing of \u201ccentrists\u201d than by adversaries on the right. Similarly, few liberal podcasts manage to hide their scorn for the Corbyn project. As Crispin puts it: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of territorial behaviour. \u2018This is what I believe; if you don\u2019t believe it too, get the hell out.\u2019 There\u2019s very little bridge building. The thing I get from most of them is not just a lack of humility but a lack of curiosity. There\u2019s the assumption that they have the right opinions.\u201d</p> <p>With that in mind, it would be fascinating to see how the likes of <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/chapo-trap-house\">Chapo</a> might react to actually getting what they want. The show\u2019s host, Will Menaker, recently sparked controversy by pledging to refuse to vote for anyone but Sanders in November. But if Sanders were to win the Democratic nomination, Chapo would be forced to move on from thinking up insults for Pete Buttigieg (\u201cRatfuck CIA operative,\u201d being a recent highlight) and on to discussing policy detail. They would move from the outer edges to the inside track.</p> <p>For a glimpse of how tricky this mainstreaming process can be, it is worth considering the opposition. Take the pugnacious provocateurs over at The Spiked Podcast. A recent episode titled The Woke Stasi spoke volumes about their determination to continue obscuring dry policy issues with emotive cultural ones.

  "<p>It\u2019s hard to imagine right now but Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden both know that in a few months they\u2019re going to have to put on a united front to have any chance of beating Donald Trump.</p> <p>Over the last few days, as the former vice-president has collected the majority of delegates needed to clinch the Democratic nomination for president, Sanders, the Vermont senator and liberal icon, has opted to press on in the primary. That sets up an ongoing bruising battle between the two candidates for the immediate future even as the vast majority of observers believe Sanders will eventually have to grit his teeth and fall in line behind Biden.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/13/bernie-sanders-fans-joe-biden-democratic-candidate\">Bernie or Bust: the Sanders fans who will never vote for Biden</a> </p> </aside>  <p>No major 2020 Democratic candidate, current or former, has told supporters not to back the eventual Democratic nominee. Likewise, no serious Democratic surrogate has urged supporters to sit out if their candidate doesn\u2019t win. It is a precedent made even more urgent given Democrats\u2019 anger at Trump and fears over him winning a second term.</p> <p>But the fierce fight between the progressive and centrist wings of the party has had an impact as the party begins to look ahead to the November battle.</p> <p>Saikat Chakrabarti, the former chief of staff to the New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the president of the New Consensus network, said the worry is not getting progressives to vote for a nominee they may not have backed in the primary. Chakrabarti said it was rallying voters who stayed out of the general election in 2016.</p> <p>\u201cThe thing I\u2019m worried about is if Joe Biden wins the nomination, what will he do to get actual voters,\u201d said Chakrabarti, \u201cthe kinds of folks who stayed home in 2016, and I mean disaffected African American voters, working class voters, people who are really having a tough time with the current economy.\u201d</p> <p>As the primary has shifted essentially to a two-man race, the rivalry between Biden and Sanders and their respective supporters has intensified. Interviews with over more than a dozen Democratic strategists and officials yields a sense of confidence that all the participants in the primary will shift their focus to defeating Donald trump in the general election.</p> <p>But these Democrats also caution that to erase hard feelings left over from the primary, the Democratic nominee will have to extend some kind of olive branch to the runner up and his supporters.Biden will have to work hard to win over disappointed grassroots progressives if he wins as expected. In the now highly unlikely event Sanders wins, he will have to ease concerns from wary Democratic moderates.</p> <p>\u201cI think there has to be a set of actions,\u201d said Steve Grossman, a former Democratic National Committee chairman. \u201cI think there has to be a consistent expression of respect for the progressive wing of the Democratic party that is palpable and meaningful and smart and savvy and thoughtful.\u201d</p> <p>In recent days Biden and his top aides have said urged Sanders supporters to come support their campaign. Similarly on Thursday, Jeff Weaver, a senior Sanders adviser, said the Vermont senator would support Biden if the former vice-president got the nomination. Weaver said Sanders would \u201cabsolutely\u201d bring his supporters into the fold even if he didn\u2019t get the nomination.</p> <p>\u201cIf Joe Biden is the nominee Bernie Sanders will support him wholeheartedly, we\u2019ll campaign for him,\u201d Weaver said.</p> <p>During Biden\u2019s election night speech on Tuesday he thanked Sanders and his supporters \u201cfor their tireless energy and their passion\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe share a common goal and together we\u2019ll defeat Donald Trump,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWe\u2019ll defeat him together. We\u2019re going to bring this nation together.\u201d</p> <p>But for now, with the contest still live and heading for a debate in Arizona on Sunday, Sanders and his supporters are showing no sign of falling in line behind Biden. Progressive Sanders supporters still see a narrow path to the nomination , even as Biden\u2019s delegate lead becomes insurmountable. For them, simply defeating Trump isn\u2019t enough.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b2e5d21a68e9bb1fe7c9815a0c5a299e329b63bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b2e5d21a68e9bb1fe7c9815a0c5a299e329b63bd/0_323_4877_2928/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Supporters of Bernie Sanders wave signs at a rally in Chicago on 7 March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Supporters of Bernie Sanders wave signs at a rally in Chicago on 7 March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charles Rex Arbogast/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jennifer Epps-Addison, <a href=\"https://populardemocracy.org/staff\">network president of the Center for Popular Democracy</a>, which endorsed Sanders, said Democrats cannot rely on antipathy to Trump to turnout young people and progressive activists inspired by Sanders campaign in November.</p> <p>\u201cIf they want our time, our energy and our organizing efforts, then they\u2019re going to have to agree to actually include us in the leadership and the governance of the party,\u201d said Epps-Addison.</p> <p>She added that if Biden is the nominee it will matter who he chooses to be his running mate, warning against anyone with a problematic record on criminal justice.</p> <p>\u201cWe are very concerned that Donald Trump right now is poised to run to the left of Joe Biden on criminal justice reform,\u201d Epps-Addison said. \u201cIt is a terrifying prospect for those of us who are knocking doors in black and brown communities that have been terrorized by the crime bill that Joe Biden was the architect of.\u201d</p> <p>In a scenario where Biden wins the nomination, he will have to consider embracing some of the issues Sanders campaigned on, said Jared Leopold, a veteran Democratic operative.</p> <p>\u201cI think a lot of it is going to be about leaning into the issues that they care about,\u201d Leopold said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that Joe Biden needs to fundamentally change who he is, but I think talking about issues that young people care about and progressives care about will be important to mobilizing those voters in the fall.\u201d</p> <p>Mark Longabaugh, a senior adviser to Sanders\u2019 2016 campaign, said that \u201cany kind of marriage is a two way street\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cBiden, if he is the nominee, would be wise to reach out and make an effort to make Sanders and his supporters feel welcome in a Biden coalition,\u201d Longabaugh said.</p> <p>And right now, Sanders has a better chance of exerting influence over the main committees at the Democratic national convention in July than winning the nomination.</p> <p>\u201cThe more delegates you have clearly the more leverage you have,\u201d Longabaugh said. \u201cAnd he has plenty of delegates.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cAnd my own view is that if Bernie Sanders does not have a good night next Tuesday, he needs to seriously think about getting out and rallying around the Joe Biden candidacy.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>On 1 September 1991, a large private yacht cruised towards the Statue of Liberty. It was a clear, breezy evening, and from the upper deck of the Spirit of New York, a golden sunset could be seen glinting off the Manhattan skyline. Downstairs, a party was in flow. Scores of teenage girls in evening dresses and miniskirts, some as young as 14, danced under disco lights. It could have been a high school prom, were it not for the crowd of older men surrounding them.</p> <p>As the evening wore on, some of the men \u2013 many old enough to be the girls\u2019 fathers, or even grandfathers \u2013 joined them on the dancefloor, pressing themselves against the girls. One balding man in a suit wrapped his arms around two young models, leering into a film camera that was documenting the evening: \u201cCan you get some beautiful women around me, please?\u201d</p> <p>The party aboard the Spirit of New York was one of several events that Donald Trump, then 45, attended with a group of 58 aspiring young models that September. They had travelled from around the world to compete in Elite\u2019s Look of the Year competition, an annual event that had been running since 1983 and was already credited with launching the careers of Cindy Crawford, Helena Christensen and Stephanie Seymour. At stake was a life-changing prize: a $150,000 contract with the world\u2019s then leading modelling agency, Elite Model Management, run by John Casablancas.</p> <p>Trump was closely involved in Casablancas\u2019s competition. In 1991, he was a headline sponsor, throwing open the Plaza, his lavish, chateau-style hotel overlooking Central Park, transforming it into the main venue and accommodating the young models. He was also one of its 10 judges.</p> <p>In 1992, Trump hosted the competition again. On a similarly golden evening in early September that year, another group of contestants boarded the Spirit of New York, chartered for another Elite cruise. One of the girls on the boat was Shawna Lee, then a 14-year-old from a small town outside Toronto. She recalls how the contestants were encouraged to parade downstairs, one by one, and dance for Trump, Casablancas and others. Lee, an introverted teenager who loved to draw but hated school, was in New York for the first time. \u201cA woman at the agency was pushing me,\u201d she recalls. \u201cI said to her, \u2018I don\u2019t see why me going down the stairs and dancing in front of those two has anything to do with me becoming a model. And she said, \u2018No, you look great, take off your blazer and go and do it.\u2019 So I walked down the stairs. I didn\u2019t dance \u2013 I blew a kiss at them, spun around and walked away.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"73e905b5773d7f06874a68de9d3904919c936d81\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73e905b5773d7f06874a68de9d3904919c936d81/0_256_5364_3219/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump with his then fiancee Marla Maples (left) and a contestant in the 1991 Look of the Year competition.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump with his then fiancee Marla Maples (left) and a contestant in the 1991 Look of the Year competition.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UNKNOWN</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"0628ffd1d76dbc449ced323cf7f5346692af72c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0628ffd1d76dbc449ced323cf7f5346692af72c4/0_225_5000_3002/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Contestants wait to board the Spirit of New York yacht in 1991\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Contestants wait to board the Spirit of New York yacht in 1991</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nina Berman/NOOR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Top: Trump with his then fiancee Marla Maples (left) and a contestant in the 1991 Look of the Year competition</p></li> <li><p>Bottom: contestants wait to board the Spirit of New York yacht, September 1991.

She says an organiser told her that if she refused, she would be excluded from the competition. \u201cI knew in my gut it wasn\u2019t right,\u201d she recalls. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t being judged or part of the competition \u2013 it was for their entertainment.\u201d</p> <p>While Elite\u2019s official brochure stated that contestants were aged between 14 and 24, all of those the Guardian has spoken to, competing in both years, were aged between 14 and 19. Some had come to New York with parents or chaperones in tow; others were alone. Many were away from their families for the first time. For them, the stakes were high, and the pressure to impress the judges great. As Casablancas had warned them at the outset of the competition, in a scene recorded by TV cameras: \u201cYou are going to be judged, constantly judged.\u201d (In 1991 and 1992, the Elite contest was filmed for a 60-minute glossy television special, featuring interviews and behind-the-scenes footage, and later screened on Fox \u2013 an early foray into reality TV.) Casablancas was a powerful figure in the industry, and to many of the new crop of would-be supermodels, this seemed an opportunity too good to miss.</p> <p>Three decades on, a very different picture of the competition is beginning to emerge. Over the last six months, the Guardian has spoken to several dozen former Look of the Year contestants, as well as industry insiders, and obtained 12 hours of previously unseen, behind-the-scenes footage. The stories we have heard suggest that Casablancas, and some of the men in his orbit, used the contest to engage in sexual relationships with vulnerable young models. Some of these allegations amount to sexual harassment, abuse or exploitation of teenage girls; others are more accurately described as rape.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"11327e133edd90c0380b7aace643f34efd0bf8f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11327e133edd90c0380b7aace643f34efd0bf8f5/592_0_2010_2011/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Naomi Campbell and John Casablancas\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Casablancas with Naomi Campbell, who co-presented the 1991 Look of the Year finale</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bettina Cirone/The LIFE Images Collection via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--halfWidth\" data-media-id=\"1a363fc8dce0ea006db2a04a469817a34c54fde1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1a363fc8dce0ea006db2a04a469817a34c54fde1/0_3_2994_2994/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trump with John Casablancas, who ran the competition, at the 1991 Look of the Year awards, at Trump\u2019s Plaza Hotel in New York\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump with John Casablancas, who ran the competition, at the 1991 Look of the Year awards, at Trump\u2019s Plaza Hotel in New York</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d26c29c2c2a2ec01559e00e72d3f67cf48fc915f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d26c29c2c2a2ec01559e00e72d3f67cf48fc915f/318_689_8865_5318/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Casablancas speaking at a Look of the Year reception in 1991 at the Plaza Hotel, alongside Trump\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Casablancas speaking at a Look of the Year reception in 1991 at the Plaza Hotel, alongside Trump</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UNKNOWN</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Top left: John Casablancas with Naomi Campbell, who co-presented the 1991 Look of the Year finale.

But his close involvement in the contest raises questions for the president. Did he know that Casablancas and others were sleeping with contestants? Why would a man in his 40s, whose main business was real-estate development, want to host a beauty contest for teenage girls?</p> <p>Journalists have scoured almost every corner of the 45th president\u2019s life, but his friendship with Casablancas, and his involvement in Look of the Year in 1991 and 1992, have been largely overlooked. Yet the competition is more than a footnote in the Donald Trump story. In time, it would prove to be the foundation of his pivot into reality TV. He even married a former Look of the Year contestant: the current first lady, Melania Trump, narrowly missed out on a trip to New York in 1992, after coming second in the Slovenian heat.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>When John Casablancas arrived in New York in 1977, aged 35, he quickly caused a stir. Branded \u201cthe snatcher\u201d for poaching models from rivals for his Elite Model Management agency, he gained a reputation as a ruthless operator. Handsome and charismatic, the son of a former Balenciaga model and a wealthy Spanish banker, he formed the agency that became Elite in Paris in his late 20s. Within years of setting up shop in New York, Casablancas was generating millions of dollars in revenue each year, and ushering in the era of the supermodel. Glamorous friends flocked to Elite parties in fashionable clubs like Studio 54.</p> <p>It\u2019s not clear how Casablancas first met Trump but, according to several former models who encountered him during the 1980s, the businessman became a regular at his parties. With the opening of Trump Tower on New York\u2019s Fifth Avenue in 1983, and the acquisition of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/mar-a-lago\" title=\"\">Mar-a-Lago</a> resort in Florida in 1985, Trump had gained the reputation of a high-flying playboy in his own right. In 1987 he published <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/commentisfree/2018/jan/18/fear-donald-trump-us-president-art-of-the-deal\" title=\"\">The Art </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/commentisfree/2018/jan/18/fear-donald-trump-us-president-art-of-the-deal\" title=\"\">Of </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/commentisfree/2018/jan/18/fear-donald-trump-us-president-art-of-the-deal\" title=\"\">The Deal</a>, and a flurry of publicity followed. \u201cHe sits atop a $3 billion empire,\u201d proclaimed the Washington Post, \u201cand seems to have a Midas touch.\u201d</p> <p>It was perhaps unsurprising that Trump, a New York celebrity who liked to date beautiful women, should come to know the city\u2019s best-known model agent. \u201cTrump was good with PR and that was something John liked,\u201d says Jeremie Roux, who now runs System, a modelling agency he cofounded with Casablancas in 2009. \u201cGood or negative press was all good to Trump.\u201d </p> <p>Patty Owen, an Elle and Cosmopolitan cover star, recalls seeing Trump at Elite parties as far back as 1982. \u201cHe would always be at the bar. That\u2019s where he would stay and that\u2019s where all the new models would hang out,\u201d she says. \u201cWhenever I saw him, I was always like: why does John have to invite him?\u201d Barbara Pilling, also then an Elite model, told us Trump asked her out for dinner in the summer of 1989 at an industry soiree. She recalls Trump asking how old she was. \u201cI said 17 and he said, \u2018That\u2019s just great \u2013 you\u2019re not too old, not too young.\u2019\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"62013683bb17f155e4359c9b002fbc591d7efeb7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/62013683bb17f155e4359c9b002fbc591d7efeb7/0_199_3312_4137/801.jpg\" alt=\"Stacy Wilkes on the Spirit Of New York, 1991, with that year\u2019s winner, Ingrid Seynhaeve\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stacy Wilkes on the Spirit Of New York, 1991, with that year\u2019s winner, Ingrid Seynhaeve</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nina Berman/NOOR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f30fe8ffe62e839629133b2a94dd2189cbe20082\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f30fe8ffe62e839629133b2a94dd2189cbe20082/0_50_844_506/500.jpg\" alt=\"Shawna Lee (second from right) with other contestants at the 1992 Look of the Year competition\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shawna Lee (second from right) with other contestants at the 1992 Look of the Year competition</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UNKNOWN</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Top: Stacy Wilkes on the Spirit of New York in 1991, with that year\u2019s winner, Ingrid Seynhaeve.

One was Shayna Love, an Australian model who was 16 when she came to New York for the first time in the summer of 1991. Recalling a dinner she attended, she says now: \u201cIt was presented as our duty as models at the agency. It wasn\u2019t an invitation. It was like, you have to go and do this.\u201d She says the dinner she attended, at which 10 or 15 models were present, was served at a long table in a private area of an upmarket restaurant. \u201cI was at one end with John, and Trump was up the other end\u2026 surrounded by the other girls.\u201d</p> <p>In the spring of 1991, Trump and Casablancas struck a business deal. Trump would sponsor Look of the Year\u2019s final and host contestants at the Plaza, which would double as the headquarters. At the time, Trump faced significant financial pressures and was close to filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, but it didn\u2019t seem to deter him. In the newly unearthed, behind-the-scenes footage of Look of the Year 1991, Trump makes a series of appearances alongside Casablancas, whom he describes as \u201cmy friend John\u201d. At one point, Casablancas reveals how he and Trump struck their business partnership. \u201cI had prepared for a long meeting with Donald Trump to explain to him why this was going to be a great success,\u201d Casablancas tells the crowd. \u201cIn fact, I hadn\u2019t finished my third sentence and he said: \u2018I love the idea. Let\u2019s do it.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Trump now disputes being friends with Casablancas. The president\u2019s representatives told the Guardian that he denies it \u201cin the strongest possible terms\u201d. Trump, they said, \u201chardly knew him, spent very little time with him, and knew very little about him\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Stacy Wilkes had never been anywhere like the New York Plaza when she arrived at Trump\u2019s hotel with another contestant in September 1991. Then 16, she was living in Louisville, Kentucky, with her mother, who was struggling to make ends meet. The teenager would hold yard sales and mow lawns to make extra cash. \u201cI was just so excited to be in a hotel,\u201d she says. \u201cTo go from a poor part of Kentucky to a place like this \u2013 I felt like the little kid in Home Alone.\u201d She recalls feeling out of place in a hotel where \u201ceverything was gold\u201d.</p> <p>The teenager had been selected as part of a sprawling international search, overseen by Casablancas, for \u201cnew faces\u201d. Many contestants had come through feeder competitions after winning regional heats, or being spotted in malls and hotel lobbies or, in one case, on the beach. Casablancas had visited Wilkes\u2019 local mall to host an Elite scouting event<strong> </strong>a year earlier, when she was 15. Her local agent had sent her to meet him, telling her what to wear and how to act.

The contestants assembled beneath crystal chandeliers at the Plaza to meet Casablancas. He told them they would be judged over several days ahead of a gala evening, when the winner would be crowned. The girls would undergo makeovers and attend photocalls, donning spandex for an exercise routine in front of the Plaza. The behind-the-scenes footage shows Casablancas informing the would-be models that attention would be paid not just to appearance, but to \u201cthe way you are, your attitude, your personality, your sense of cooperation\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9b2766b71eba32562d777976e1c0c817efab733d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b2766b71eba32562d777976e1c0c817efab733d/178_29_809_486/500.jpg\" alt=\"from left: John Casablancas, photographer Patrick Demarchelier and G\u00e9rald Marie, head of Elite\u2019s Paris office and a 1991 Look of the Year judge.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">from left: John Casablancas, photographer Patrick Demarchelier and G\u00e9rald Marie, head of Elite\u2019s Paris office and a 1991 Look of the Year judge.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: FameFlynet.uk.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f86f6b1fb6a2e15c808156d262eefa38b3d2ff36\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f86f6b1fb6a2e15c808156d262eefa38b3d2ff36/0_416_2999_1799/1000.png\" alt=\"Donald Trump with contestants in the 1991 Look of the Year competition, the year he was a judge\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump with contestants in the 1991 Look of the Year competition, the year he was a judge</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UNKNOWN</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Top, from left: John Casablancas, photographer Patrick Demarchelier and G\u00e9rald Marie, head of Elite\u2019s Paris office and a 1991 Look of the Year judge.

The 1992 Fox documentary reported that the average age was 15, and the film\u2019s interviews make the youth of many contestants plain. Standing before the judges for the key swimwear round, the aspiring models are asked to tell the panel about themselves. \u201cI sing and love animals,\u201d says one girl, nervously. Another tells the judges: \u201cI like big dogs and chocolate.\u201d Later, during a photoshoot, a photographer instructs a 15-year-old to show more of her cleavage by pulling her bra lower. \u201cMore,\u201d he tells her. \u201cMore. More.\u201d</p> <p>In 1991, there were 10 judges in total, eight of them men, including Trump, Casablancas, the celebrity magician David Copperfield, and the president of Elite\u2019s European division, G\u00e9rald Marie. For the swimwear round, judges including Trump and Casablancas sat at a table in one of the Plaza\u2019s palatial rooms, rating the teenage models. \u201cI felt so uncomfortable, standing there in my bathing suit,\u201d recalls Wilkes. She says that at one stage of the contest the judges said she should lose weight: \u201cIt felt like they were ganging up on me.\u201d</p> <p>The contestant who came third in 1991 was Kate Dillon, then 17. Dillon, who went on to become a successful plus-sized model, says that many of her fellow competitors were \u201cfrom places that were very poor. I came from a family that had means, so it was something fun to do for a week to get out of school \u2013 but a lot of these girls were desperate.\u201d She recalls various \u201cafter-hours\u201d events over the course of the five-day competition. \u201cIt was very clear that there were opportunities to go out and party with Donald,\u201d she says. The contestants were led to believe \u201cthat if you were nice to certain people, good things will happen to you, and I think that\u2019s why girls were going out\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Every time we changed, Trump would find a reason to come backstage</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The behind-the-scenes footage seen by the Guardian shows brief snippets of the future president mingling with the Look of the Year models. At an evening reception, he seems to play the role of host, moving regally around the Plaza\u2019s ornate rooms in a suit and tie, talking to VIP guests and contestants. \u201cHow\u2019s the Canadian contestants?\u201d he asks, before moving over to a handful of Canadian would-be models and introducing himself. At another point, he circulates on the top deck of the Spirit of New York as the boat prepares to depart. Wearing a billowing cream blazer, pink open-neck shirt and oversized baseball cap, Trump grins while posing for photographs and chatting to several girls. One tells him she is just finishing school.</p> <p>Some former contestants recall him being there as they got dressed for events. \u201cEvery time we changed, it was like Trump would find a reason to come backstage,\u201d Wilkes says. A Canadian contestant from 1992 recalls similar incidents. \u201cHe\u2019d come by and say, \u2018Hey girls, are we ready?\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cI remember thinking, what have I got myself into?\u201d Trump denies, \u201cin the strongest possible terms\u201d, behaving inappropriately with any Look of the Year contestants. His representatives say he was not aware of any predatory environment at the time.</p> <p>Others, however, observed a disturbing side to the contest. Ohad Oman, a young reporter for a magazine in Tel Aviv, was sent to cover it in 1991 and 1992. He attended a number of the after-parties, and remembers seeing girls drinking alcohol. He recalls one particularly debauched party, telling the Guardian: \u201cI saw girls sitting on guys\u2019 laps, and I remember one guy putting his hand down a girl\u2019s top. I remember thinking they were younger than me, and I was 17 going on 18.\u201d (The legal drinking age is 21 in the US.)</p> <p>Others who were present recall underage models being served alcohol at the contest. Trump\u2019s representatives say he did not provide alcohol to contestants, or encourage any models, whether below the drinking age or not, to drink alcohol, stressing he \u201cdoes not drink alcohol and does not encourage others to do so\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c2bbe0a7475df6aff1ae4b831cdb6b26b97c752b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2bbe0a7475df6aff1ae4b831cdb6b26b97c752b/0_0_1366_820/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A still from previously unseen footage of the 1991 Look of the Year finale\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A still from previously unseen footage of the 1991 Look of the Year finale</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Behind the scenes footage from 'Look of the year'</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>A still from previously unseen footage of the 1991 Look of the Year finale</p></li> </ul> <p>The finale of the 1991 competition was a glittering black-tie gala in the Plaza\u2019s ballroom. Casablancas and supermodel Naomi Campbell presented, as 10 finalists went through a series of costume changes, walking across a stage decorated with columns of sunflowers. Trump sat on the front row alongside a roster of celebrities, his nine-year-old daughter Ivanka perched on his knee.</p> <p>Ingrid Seynhaeve, an 18-year-old from Belgium, was crowned the winner. As the evening drew to a close, Seynhaeve was surrounded by photographers. Guests filtered out of the ballroom as a party got going in another of the Plaza\u2019s grand rooms. In the newly uncovered footage, a man can be heard off-camera, saying: \u201cCome on, babes. Let\u2019s get some liquor in you.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>In the months before and after the contests, Elite sent several of its teenage models to Milan, New York or Paris on assignments, usually by themselves. Shawna Lee, the 14-year-old from Canada who felt pressured to perform on the Spirit of New York in 1992, had spent the previous summer in Paris, working for Elite. She recalls days at castings, and nights out partying, including at the legendary Les Bains Douches nightclub.</p> <p>After one drunken night at the club, one of the first times she had drunk alcohol, she says a senior executive at Elite offered her a ride home on his motorbike. G\u00e9rald Marie, then in his early 40s, was head of Elite\u2019s Paris office, a powerful figure in the fashion industry and a 1991 Look of the Year judge. Lee accepted the offer. \u201cI was like, OK, sure, because I was always relying on whoever to get me home,\u201d she says. But she alleges that, rather than taking her home, Marie brought her to his apartment and told her to come to his bedroom. Lee says she initially refused, asking about his wife. She says Marie responded: \u201cOh no, just come and sleep in the bed with me, don\u2019t worry,\u201d and she relented. \u201cSo I don\u2019t know, I just went.\u201d</p> <p>Lee says the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/metoo-movement\" title=\"\">#MeToo movement</a> has emboldened her to talk about what happened next. It was her first sexual experience. \u201cI just froze,\u201d she says. \u201cI really didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d Looking back 30 years later, she feels she was taken advantage of. \u201cI just felt really pressured,\u201d she says. \u201cI was really young and I was manipulated.\u201d She told a friend what had happened, and this soon got back to Elite\u2019s agents. \u201cThey all knew something went down, but they downplayed it,\u201d says Lee, who is now 42 and works as a makeup artist in Toronto. \u201cIt was just understood that it was in my best interest to walk away from it and brush it under the rug.\u201d</p> <p>Questions about Marie\u2019s alleged mistreatment of teenage models are not new. In 2000, New York magazine reported that two of Elite\u2019s senior women executives had pleaded with both Casablancas and Marie to <a href=\"https://nymag.com/nymetro/news/politics/columns/citypolitic/1866/\" title=\"\">stop sleeping with underage models</a>, but had been ignored. (\u201cWe are men,\u201d Marie reportedly said. \u201cWe have our needs.\u201d) In 2011, the Elite supermodel and actor Carr\u00e9 Otis alleged that Marie had repeatedly raped her when she was a 17-year-old model in Paris in the 1980s. Two years ago, another Elite model, Ebba Karlsson, accused Marie of raping her when she was 21.</p> <p>Marie did not respond to a formal letter from the Guardian, but in a brief phone call insisted he had never sexually assaulted any models, and denied the specific allegations levelled against him by Lee. \u201cIt\u2019s absurd, I don\u2019t know this person,\u201d he said. \u201cAllegations like this are becoming too easy to make. Frankly, it hurts.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b9a0712782ac33f4934f8f11620a82961c25be1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b9a0712782ac33f4934f8f11620a82961c25be1/0_18_1975_2468/800.jpg\" alt=\"Trump with his nine-year-old daughter Ivanka at the competition final in 1991\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trump with his nine-year-old daughter Ivanka at the 1991 Look of the Year final</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Trump with his nine-year-old daughter Ivanka at the 1991 Look of the Year final. Photograph: Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images</p></li> </ul> <p>Other men closely involved in Look of the Year during this period have been accused of sexual misconduct by former contestants. Some allegations are contained in legal proceedings filed decades ago; others have been shared for the first time with the Guardian. The newspaper has decided not to publish some of these allegations, at the request of the women involved.</p> <p>One allegation already made public concerns David Copperfield, an associate of both Casablancas and Trump, who judged Look of the Year in 1988 and 1991, and once dated another Elite supermodel, Claudia Schiffer. Two years ago, as the #MeToo movement reverberated through the entertainment industry, he was the subject of allegations by Brittney Lewis, a 17-year-old contestant in the 1988 Look of the Year, held in Japan. According to her account, published on the <a href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/david-copperfield-accused-drugging-assaulting-17-year-old-model-1988/\" title=\"\">entertainment news website The Wrap</a>, Copperfield invited her to a show in California after she had returned home to Utah. Lewis alleged that she saw Copperfield pour something into her glass and then blanked out, but says she retained hazy recollections of him sexually assaulting her in his hotel room. Copperfield stated on Twitter at the time that he had been \u201cfalsely accused\u201d in the past, and was now having to \u201cweather another storm\u201d. He added: \u201cPlease for everyone\u2019s sake, don\u2019t rush to judgment.\u201d In response to the Guardian\u2019s questions about the alleged assault, his representatives said that the claims were false and seriously defamatory.</p> <p>Several of the 1991 contestants recall Copperfield behaving in a way that now strikes them as inappropriate. Stacy Wilkes says Copperfield called the hotel room she was sharing with another 15-year-old contestant, inviting the other girl to his room. Another remembers translating a phone call from Copperfield into Spanish so he could invite a teenage contestant to his hotel room. Aimee Bendio, who was a 14-year-old Look of the Year contestant in 1991, says Copperfield and his assistant contacted her at her family home several times after she took part in the contest, \u201cchecking in to see how my career was going\u201d. She says the magician invited her to his shows, offering to send a limousine, but she declined.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A 14-year-old contestant says Copperfield contacted her family home several times afterwards</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6cc912a5b055ed06f0104ea0a692740d9abc5e6f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6cc912a5b055ed06f0104ea0a692740d9abc5e6f/0_479_9102_5459/1000.jpg\" alt=\"magician David Copperfield on the Spirit of New York, 1991, the year he was a judge\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">magician David Copperfield on the Spirit of New York, 1991, the year he was a judge</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UNKNOWN</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bbc23216ca90819cbf5270b11e9aae10f0b511ca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bbc23216ca90819cbf5270b11e9aae10f0b511ca/295_0_1401_1751/800.jpg\" alt=\"Copperfield with former girlfriend Claudia Schiffer\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Copperfield with former girlfriend Claudia Schiffer</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ron Galella Collection via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Top: magician David Copperfield on the Spirit of New York in 1991, the year he was a judge</p></li> <li><p>Bottom: Copperfield with former girlfriend Claudia Schiffer.

Copperfield categorically denies behaving inappropriately with any contestants at any time.</p> <p>In the early 90s, Look of the Year contestants who secured modelling contracts with Elite were introduced to a fledgling financial advisory firm, Star Capital Management. It was run by an associate of Casablancas, David Weil. Housed at Elite\u2019s Manhattan offices, and an official sponsor of Look of the Year, Weil\u2019s company advertised its services in the 1991 competition programme with a photograph of a small girl dressed in adult clothing and jewellery, alongside the marketing line: \u201cJust like you, we\u2019re not just another pretty face.\u201d</p> <p>By the following year, Star Capital Management was handling millions of dollars earned by Elite\u2019s models. The business soon caught the attention of federal authorities, who later accused Weil and his business partner of stealing at least $1.2m from their clients. In 1998, Weil pleaded guilty to federal fraud charges. He also pleaded guilty to the statutory rape of a 15-year-old model he had met at Look of the Year in 1992.</p> <p>Weil was sentenced to serve weekends in prison for three months, and required to register as a sex offender for 10 years. Mark Lawless, a New York lawyer who brought a civil fraud case against Star Capital Management on behalf of the 1991 Look of the Year winner Ingrid Seynhaeve and others, says that when he inspected its office, he found an adjoining bedroom. One of the desk\u2019s drawers, he recalls, contained \u201cbullets and condoms\u201d. Weil declined to comment when contacted by the Guardian.</p> <p>Four years after Weil\u2019s conviction, in 2002, Casablancas faced his own set of accusations in the civil courts. A former Look of the Year contestant, known only as Jane Doe 44, filed a lawsuit <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/73174/strokes-singers-dad-named-in-sex-abuse-suit\" title=\"\">accusing him of repeatedly sexually abusing her</a>, beginning when she was 15. The abuse began, according to the lawsuit, at Look of the Year 1988 in Japan, where Casablancas told Doe he was \u201cfalling in love\u201d with her. At the end of the competition, the lawsuit states, \u201ccontestants drank and partied late into the evening\u201d and Casablancas told the teenager to come to his hotel room. There, Casablancas sexually abused the girl \u201cseveral times over the evening\u201d. The abuse allegedly continued the following year; when the girl became pregnant, Casablancas told her \u201cshe would be having an abortion\u201d. The abortion was allegedly \u201carranged and paid for\u201d by Elite. Casablancas was 46 at the time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f376d0812a82d7fae68a6bb459e26bebdf17848\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0f376d0812a82d7fae68a6bb459e26bebdf17848/157_245_1343_1678/800.jpg\" alt=\"John Casablancas with his third wife, Aline Wermelinger; they met when she was a 1992 Look of the Year contestant \" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Casablancas with his third wife, Aline Wermelinger, in 1995; they met when she was a 1992 Look of the Year contestant <br><br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Time &amp; Life Pictures/The LIFE Picture Collection via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>John Casablancas with his third wife, Aline Wermelinger, in 1995; they met when she was a 1992 Look of the Year contestant. Photograph: The LIFE Picture Collection via Getty Images</p></li> </ul> <p>The lawsuit also alleged that Casablancas \u201cengaged in a pattern of seducing, sexually exploiting and/or abusing minor girls, including girls as young as 14 or 15 years old\u201d. But in 2003, the Los Angeles superior court dismissed the claims against him because he did not live in California, where it had been filed. At the time, a lawyer for Casablancas said the allegations were without merit.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s representatives have told the Guardian he denies in the strongest possible terms having any knowledge at the time that Casablancas allegedly engaged in sexual relationships with Look of the Year contestants, including those who were under the age of consent, or that Casablancas allegedly enabled others to exploit or abuse teenage models.</p> <p>But Casablancas\u2019 sexual interest in teenage girls predated this period. His marriage to his second wife, Danish model Jeanette Christiansen, ended in 1983 when it emerged that he was having an affair with a 15-year-old model, Stephanie Seymour. Casablancas, who was in his early 40s at the time, later described Seymour as a \u201cwoman-child\u201d. He met his third wife, Brazilian model Aline Wermelinger, in 1992, when she was a Look of the Year contestant staying at Trump\u2019s Plaza. They married the following year; Casablancas was 51 and she was 17.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>By his own account, Donald Trump got to know <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeffrey-epstein\" title=\"\">financier Jeffrey Epstein</a> in the late 1980s. \u201cHe\u2019s a lot of fun to be with,\u201d Trump famously told New York magazine in 2002. \u201cIt is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.\u201d After Epstein was charged with the sex trafficking of underage girls last year, the president distanced himself, telling reporters he knew the financier \u201clike everybody in Palm Beach knew him\u201d, but hadn\u2019t spoken to him in 15 years. \u201cI was not a fan of his, that I can tell you,\u201d he said. Trump\u2019s representatives told the Guardian that he had \u201ckicked Mr Epstein out\u201d of Mar-a-Lago for acting inappropriately towards staff.</p> <p>Photographs of Trump with Epstein, who owned a house near Mar-a-Lago, were widely circulated in the wake of the financier\u2019s arrest last year. Renewed attention was also given to a deposition by Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who said she was first approached by Epstein\u2019s friend, the British socialite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/12/ghislaine-maxwell-woman-accused-jeffrey-epstein-groom-girls\" title=\"\">Ghislaine Maxwell</a>, while working as a spa attendant at Mar-a-Lago in 1999.</p> <p>It also appears that Epstein had a Casablancas connection during the 1990s. According to a lawsuit filed in the US three months ago, in 1990 Casablancas sent a teenage model for her first \u201ccasting call\u201d at a residential address on New York\u2019s Upper East Side, to meet a \u201cphotographer\u201d who, it turned out, was Epstein. The lawsuit states that Epstein ordered the 15-year-old girl to undress before taking photographs of her, pushing her against a wall and sexually assaulting her.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Story%20tips%3F&amp;description=Do%20you%20have%20information%20about%20this%20story%3F%20Email%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22mailto%3Ainvestigations%40theguardian.com%22%3Einvestigations%40theguardian.com%3C%2Fa%3E%2C%20or%20use%20Signal%20or%20WhatsApp%20to%20message%20(UK)%20%2B44%207584%20640566%20or%20(US)%20%2B1%20646%20886%208761.%20For%20the%20most%20secure%20communications%2C%20use%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsecuredrop%22%3ESecureDrop%3C%2Fa%3E%20or%20see%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fhelp%2Fng-interactive%2F2017%2Fmar%2F17%2Fcontact-the-guardian-securely%22%3Eour%20guide%3C%2Fa%3E.&amp;link=false\" data-alt=\"Do you have information about this story?

Houraney says that Trump asked him to organise a party that month with some of his pageant\u2019s finalists, promising to invite heads of modelling agencies and prospective sponsors for his competition. \u201cHe had me fly in all these girls, and gave me a $30,000 budget for airfares and limos to pick them up at the airport,\u201d he says. \u201cThe girls were all decked out, expecting to meet all these VIPs.\u201d But after an hour at the party, Houraney says, there seemed to be only one other guest: Epstein. \u201cI was like, \u2018Donald, where are the guys? What\u2019s going on here?\u2019 And he said, \u2018Well, this is it.\u2019\u201d Houraney says he realised \u201cthis is a Jeff Epstein party, basically\u201d.</p> <p>While suspicious of Epstein, Houraney was keen to have Trump as a business partner. A month earlier, in December 1992, Trump had met with Houraney and Jill Harth, who ran the pageant together. They were looking for a new sponsor for their contest, which each year saw models aged 16 to 22 compete to appear in wall calendars wearing bikinis and swimsuits while posing with classic cars. At dinner in the Plaza\u2019s Oak Room, Harth, Houraney and Trump discussed moving the American Dream competition from Las Vegas to one of Trump\u2019s casinos. \u201cHe wanted to build this into the biggest, the best thing that he could do. He was talking about television and pulling out all the contacts,\u201d Harth later said. Eventually, the pageant was held at Trump Castle in Atlantic City in November 1993, but for one year only.</p> <p>The partnership soured and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jul/20/donald-trump-sexual-assault-allegations-jill-harth-interview\" title=\"\">ended in two lawsuits</a>, but for Trump it was a prelude to a series of more lucrative ventures in the beauty business. In 1996, he secured what the New York Daily News described as \u201chis most beautiful deal yet\u201d. After months of negotiations, Trump acquired the Miss Universe Organization in a reported $10m deal that handed him control of three large, well-established pageants: Miss Universe, Miss USA, and Miss Teen USA. Three years later, he founded Trump Model Management, poaching many staff from Elite.</p> <p>For Wolfgang Schwarz, a veteran model agent in Austria who worked closely with Casablancas, and met Trump at the Plaza in the early 90s, Trump\u2019s decision to establish his own agency was about him wanting his own private source for models. \u201cIf you have your own agency and you\u2019re the owner, you can tell your bookers to make a party,\u201d Schwarz says. \u201cIt\u2019s easier than calling 15 agencies in New York.\u201d Trump\u2019s representatives say he entered the modelling industry because it was a \u201cvery profitable\u201d business opportunity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b4e6396381288420f7ed2b6e0059889d452c23c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4e6396381288420f7ed2b6e0059889d452c23c3/0_16_1152_691/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kate Dillon, in footage from the 1991 contest\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kate Dillon, in footage from the 1991 contest</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UNKNOWN</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bed41e88ed2cc6f54cb40509692bae2b9907d346\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bed41e88ed2cc6f54cb40509692bae2b9907d346/26_0_2723_3402/800.jpg\" alt=\"Casablancas with 1992 Look of the Year winner Mariann Molski, then 14\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Casablancas with 1992 Look of the Year winner Mariann Molski, then 14</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett Collection Inc/Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Top: Kate Dillon, in behind-the-scenes footage from the 1991 contest</p></li> <li><p>Bottom: Casablancas with 1992 Look of the Year winner Mariann Molski, then 14. Photograph: Everett Collection/Alamy</p></li> </ul> <p>The Miss Universe deal allowed Trump to realise his ambition of turning a pageant into an international televised event. In 1997, he <a href=\"https://variety.com/1997/tv/news/cbs-trump-ink-beauty-of-a-partnership-1117433243/\" title=\"\">sold a 50% stake in the business to CBS</a>. Five years later, amid a slump in the Miss Universe ratings, Trump brokered a deal with NBC that led to the launch of The Apprentice in 2004.</p> <p>The move into reality TV positioned Trump as a heavyweight tycoon with a significant media profile. In many ways, it was a natural progression from his involvement in beauty contests and pageants. Where once he had judged young models, whose hopes, rivalries and insecurities became TV storylines in Fox\u2019s Look of the Year documentary, now he was ruthlessly separating aspiring business people into winners and losers. </p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Three decades on from the contests at Trump\u2019s Plaza, it is striking to reflect on the diverging fortunes of those who attended. Many of the powerful men Casablancas brought on board to help judge the girls thrived in the years that followed. G\u00e9rald Marie is now the chairman of a prestigious model agency in Paris, Oui Management. Although Marie told the Guardian he had retired, his LinkedIn page lists his responsibilities at the \u201cthriving newcomer\u201d agency as scouting for and managing talent. Oui Management did not respond to our request for comment.<strong> </strong>David Copperfield remains a prominent entertainer, with a current residency at the MGM Grand resort in Las Vegas.</p> <p>The fortunes of the teenagers who took part have been mixed. Some became successful models, Hollywood actors and TV hosts, while many more lived quieter lives. Ingrid Seynhaeve, the 1991 winner, became a face of Ralph Lauren and Dior, hosted Belgium\u2019s Topmodel TV show, and continues to front high-profile campaigns. Other contestants we spoke to include a beautician, a stay\u2013at\u2013home mother, a makeup artist, a yoga teacher and a bus driver.</p> <p>In 1992, the crown went to one of Look of the Year\u2019s youngest contenders: 14-year-old Mariann Molski. Months after her victory, a profile in the Chicago Tribune reported that the sporty high school student was \u201con the brink of a career of a kind that most young women only dream about\u201d. While she had some success as a model, it is not clear what happened to her in the years that followed; US public records indicate multiple arrests for probation violations, alcohol offences and prostitution, though there is nothing to say she was ever charged. Molski\u2019s current whereabouts are unknown, but she is believed to have been homeless in Arizona.</p> <p>After years of financial mismanagement, Elite was forced into bankruptcy in 2004. The Elite brand continues to be used by two separate agencies, owned by different corporate entities. One is Creative World Management, which bought the New York division in 2004. It strongly distances itself from the Casablancas-owned firm and era, saying it \u201cutterly\u201d condemns the kinds of \u201cdeplorable behaviour\u201d alleged to have taken place in the past.</p> <p>The other inheritor of the brand is Elite World Group, which operates the successor to Look of the Year, a similar global contest for the next top young model, called <a href=\"https://elitemodellook.com/int/en/home/index.htm\" title=\"\">Elite Model Look</a>. It, too, distances itself from the Casablancas era. \u201cWe would have no tolerance for the conduct you\u2019ve described,\u201d the company told the Guardian. \u201cEmpowering our models and protecting their safety is our foremost priority.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c37949875c04912789569901f8ef9654513eb14e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c37949875c04912789569901f8ef9654513eb14e/93_299_8923_5358/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump with contestants in 1991\u2019s Elite Look of the Year, the year he was a judge\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump with contestants in 1991\u2019s Elite Look of the Year, the year he was a judge</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UNKNOWN</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e1a582803c3bcc591986a226f62a55440e1796af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e1a582803c3bcc591986a226f62a55440e1796af/0_534_8907_5344/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump, then 45, with contestants in the 1991 Elite Look of the Year contest, the year he was a judge.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump, then 45, with contestants in the 1991 Elite Look of the Year contest, the year he was a judge.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UNKNOWN</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p>Donald Trump with contestants in 1991\u2019s Elite Look of the Year</p></li> </ul> <p>John Casablancas retired in Brazil in the early 2000s. He died in Rio de Janeiro in 2013, aged 70, long before the #MeToo movement heralded a new standard of accountability for powerful men accused of exploiting women and girls. He never got to see his old associate Donald Trump ascend to the White House, despite a cascade of allegations about Trump\u2019s own treatment of women. There are now <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/women-accused-trump-sexual-misconduct-list-2017-12?r=US&amp;IR=T\">at least 25 sexual misconduct allegations</a> against the president, ranging from unwanted advances and harassment to serious sexual assaults. More than half relate to models or pageant contestants. Trump denies that he has ever behaved in a predatory or inappropriate fashion with any women or girls. </p> <p>Speaking to the Guardian 30 years on, several former Look of the Year contestants feel that a #MeToo moment for the modelling world is long overdue. \u201cThe girls are young and they look at these agents like parental figures, and they\u2019re not,\u201d says Shawna Lee. \u201cAnything they say goes, whether it\u2019s \u2018Go cut your hair\u2019, \u2018Go wear this dress\u2019. It\u2019s too bad that there were not more consequences for these men.\u201d</p> <p>After Look of the Year 1991, Stacy Wilkes returned to Louisville and quit school, despite having told the judges she would finish. \u201cI thought that was the reason I lost,\u201d she says, \u201cso I might as well leave if I want to make it as a model. We were really broke, so I thought I\u2019d try and make money for my mom, but it didn\u2019t work out.\u201d She is content with the path her life took, living in Louisville with her partner and three cats, but adds that women were raising concerns at the time and were ignored: \u201cI think models from the 90s tried so hard, over and over, and nobody believed what we had to say.\u201d</p> <p>Kate Dillon, now a businesswoman living in Seattle, remembers the contest as one that \u201cexploited women\u2019s assets, women\u2019s bodies. A lot of these girls were desperate. They thought modelling was about attracting men, which it isn\u2019t.\u201d There was a climate of opportunism, she says. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that the men were like, \u2018Yes, Look of the Year week, let\u2019s make sure my schedule is clear to have chicks over to my apartment.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s great is that we now have a language, and a precedent of young people saying: \u2018No, I\u2019m not going to let this continue\u2019,\u201d Dillon adds. \u201cThey would never accept being treated the way I was.\u201d </p> <p>\u2022 If you would like your comment on this piece to be considered for Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page, please email <a href=\"mailto:weekend@theguardian.com\" title=\"\">weekend@theguardian.com</a>, including your name and address (not for publication).</p> <p><em>The Guardian will continue to investigate the issues raised in this story.

  "<p>It was just before 9am and the sky was overcast when a small group of reporters were suddenly ushered through the White House\u2019s south portico. They gathered in <a href=\"http://www.whitehousemuseum.org/floor0/diplomatic-room.htm\">the diplomatic reception room,</a> once home to Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s \u201cfireside chats\u201d, and stared at a desk with pen, documents and the presidential seal.</p> \n<p>Donald Trump strode in, wearing a black bomber jacket and white shirt unbuttoned at the top, and settled down beneath a portrait of George Washington. He signed a congressional emergency spending bill to combat the coronavirus for $8.3bn \u2013 more than three times what the president himself had requested \u2013 and held it up to a chorus of clicking cameras.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re doing very well,\u201d he insisted. \u201cBut it\u2019s an unforeseen problem. What a problem. Came out of nowhere, but we\u2019re taking care of it.\u201d He gazed around the oval-shaped room, wallpapered romantic American landscapes, and took questions. Someone asked: \u201cHow do you keep people from panicking?\u201d Trump\u2019s response in part: \u201cCalm. You have to be calm. It\u2019ll go away.\u201d</p> \n<p>It has not gone away.</p> \n<p>A week later, coronavirus cases in the US have soared past 1,300, with at least 38 deaths. The stock market suffered its worst percentage drop since the 1987 Wall Street crash. On Wednesday night alone, Trump announced a travel ban on most of Europe during an Oval Office address, the National Basketball Association suspended its season and it emerged the Hollywood actor Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson had tested positive. <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-am-401d8f45-603c-4491-9c4b-8c27d14f3a4b.html?chunk=0&amp;utm_term=emshare#story0\">The New York Post\u2019s front page headline</a> declared: A world turned upside down.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5b86d89c-98d6-4d80-ba4b-9c7affda275f\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NezEbDx4B9A?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>It is at such moments of peril that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/us/politics/president-leadership-crisis.html\">a nation looks to its leader</a> for reassurance and direction.

The NSC\u2019s global health security chief, Rear Admiral Tim Ziemer, was fired the day after an Ebola outbreak was declared in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Last year intelligence agencies warned that the US remained vulnerable to the next flu pandemic but Trump, it seems, hoped that his long streak of political luck would hold.</p> \n<p>Distracted by impeachment in January, the president showed little urgency when the coronavirus exploded in China, apparently unwilling to sour his relationship with authoritarian leader Xi Jinping, whom he praised for having the outbreak \u201ctotally under control\u201d even as it raced across that country and beyond.</p> \n<p>The White House did impose a limited travel ban on China but that alone was not enough.

Well, I think almost universally people would say Trump has not handled this well.\u201d</p> \n<p>Even if Trump tried to dismiss the health statistics, he could not ignore the financial markets, an obsession he has made central to his reelection. He put vice-president Mike Pence in charge of a coronavirus task force, demoting Health Secretary Alex Azar, but continued to get in the way of the message.</p> \n<p>Soon after signing the congressional funding bill last Friday, Trump donned a \u201cKeep America great\u201d campaign cap and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/06/us-coronavirus-death-toll-washington-state\">visited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> in Atlanta. In remarks that many found confounding and frightening, he described the governor of Washington state as a \u201csnake\u201d, praised his own expertise and falsely claimed that anyone who wants a coronavirus test can get one. Pence was later forced to correct this.</p> \n<p>But on Monday the full horror of the economic implications dawned on Trump as he flew from Florida to Washington on Air Force One. In his on-board office, Fox News showed graphics illustrating the single worst day for markets since the financial crisis of 2008. Fellow passenger Matt Gaetz, a Republican congressman, had isolated himself in part of the plane after learning he had come into contact with an infected person.</p> \n<p>Trump travelled to Capitol Hill for lunch with Senate Republicans on Tuesday. He promised: \u201cWe\u2019re doing a great job with it. And it will go away. Just stay calm. It will go away.\u201d A day later, Dr Anthony Fauci, one of the government\u2019s top public health experts, testified: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RapD4-7uAbg\">\u201cBottom line, it\u2019s going to get worse.\u201d</a></p> \n<p>The president tried to provide further reassurance in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/11/donald-trump-us-coronavirus-address\">only his second Oval Office address</a> on Wednesday night. But it had the exact opposite effect. He blindsided European governments by announcing a 30-day travel ban to keep out the \u201cforeign virus\u201d. He also failed to explain how tests will become available and committed factual errors the White House was forced to hastily correct.</p> \n<p>Susan Rice, former national security adviser, tweeted simply: \u201cOMG.\u201d</p> \n<p>Eight months <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/12/trump-coronavirus-election-impact-bernie-sanders-joe-biden\">from a presidential election,</a> the virus has jeopardised Trump\u2019s central reelection argument \u2013 a strong economy \u2013 just as Joe Biden, the candidate emerging from the Democratic field, seems poised to take advantage by offering stability and a safe pair of hands.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MichaelSteele?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Michael Steele,</a> former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said: \u201cThe most calming and reassuring presidential voice of the past 24 hours has been Joe Biden. As a Republican, this is hard for me to say but it\u2019s true.\u201d</p> \n<p>The coronavirus pandemic is being described as a once-in-a-lifetime event. History remembers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/oct/07/doris-kearns-goodwin-leadership-in-turbulent-times-trump\">how presidents handle such crises</a> \u2013 and to Trump, it seems unlikely to be kind. He may be regarded as a Nero, fiddling while Rome burned.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/moevela?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Moe Vela,</a> a former senior adviser to Biden, said: \u201cHe is unable to express compassion and empathy; I don\u2019t believe he possesses those two values. This was his chance to show that he could lead, to show that he was as tough as he said he was for three years. And then what does he do? He falls on his face.\u201d</p> \n<p>Vela, an LGBTQ and Latino activist and board director at TransparentBusiness, added: \u201cWe\u2019re walking around in ghost towns. Kids aren\u2019t going to school. Not enough people are getting tested. We have no clue what the reality of this pandemic is because information is being withheld and reaction from this administration was slow at best. It\u2019s disgusting. It\u2019s disconcerting. It\u2019s scary as hell.\u201d</p>",

Bowen questioned why the prime minister and other minister\u2019s were not tested after the home affairs minister <strong>Peter Dutton</strong> was diagnosed with Covid-19 on Friday. Dutton has now been admitted to hospital. Bowen accused the cabinet of failing to take the same measures the community is being told to undertake in terms of self-isolation and testing.</p> \n  <p>But in a press conference immediately after Bowen\u2019s, Australia\u2019s chief medical officer <strong>Professor Brendan Murphy</strong> backed Morrison\u2019s decision not to get tested. Murphy said;</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>No member of cabinet was in contact with Minister Dutton within 24 hours of him becoming symptomatic, nor was I in fact in contact with him. So the prime minister was very, very clear to me that the cabinet and all the public officials follow the exact same public health rules as everybody else in the Australian community. If there had been a requirement for quarantine, he was insistent that government and cabinet follow those rules, so we just follow the normal public health advice, no-one had been in contact with the minister in that period. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Murphy said only people in close contact with someone in the 24-hour period before they developed symptoms needed to go through testing and isolation. Murphy said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>That has always been our public health advice. So if you have been in contact with them two or three days before they are symptomatic, they are very, very, very unlikely to be infectious so we don\u2019t believe you need to quarantine.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>This is because people are most likely to spread the disease when showing symptoms, such as coughing and spluttering.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6c28268f085e564ad83ece\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-14T00:44:46.728Z\">12.44am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">New Zealand cancels Christchurch shootings remembrance service</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A national remembrance service to mark the one year anniversary of the Christchurch mosques attack in New Zealand has been cancelled due to the coronavirus. </p> \n  <p>As recently as Friday, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the event could take place as New Zealand is yet to record a community transmission of Covid-19. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThis is a pragmatic decision.

Morrison said: \u201c\u2018The fact that I would still be going on Saturday speaks not just to my passion for my beloved Sharks; it might be the last game I get to go to for a long time\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Following public pressure Morrison has now said he will not attend the game. On Saturday morning Bowen said Morrison had displayed \u201ca gob-smacking lack of judgement\u201d. He said the public were tired of mixed-messaging from the federal government;</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I understand many people are disappointed about various events, but as I said, tough decisions now avoid much tougher times later. I was disappointed, in fact gobsmacked that the prime minister indicated he would still be attending the football after the advice from active medical officers.</p> \n   <p>Yes, the advice only formally comes into effect on Monday, but leadership is about more than rules and regulations. It is about being the example you set. I understand Scott Morrison wanted to go to the football... I wanted to go to the football as well.

Matches this weekend will continue to take place, but without spectators.</p> \n  <p>This morning at a regular press conference which the head of the Robert Koch Institute, the leading public health and safety body in Germany has been holding for the past two and a half weeks, its director, Lothar Wieler said public health bodies had three aims in their attempts to tackle the virus. </p> \n  <ol> \n   <li>To try to \u2018level off\u2019 the epidemic curve, to ensure the most seriously ill don\u2019t end up having to be hospitalised at the same time.</li> \n   <li>To try to speed up the adaptation of hospitals to cope with an increase in intensive care beds and patients who will need respiratory assistance. He said the virus was a \u201cstress test\u201d for Germany\u2019s health care system.</li> \n   <li>To slow down the spread of the illness by cancelling large events. Every citizen should be prepared to reduce their social contacts, he said. \u201cEach and every one of us needs to simply consider what he absolutely has to do\u201d, and cancel everything else, he said. </li> \n  </ol> \n  <p>Wieler said Bavaria\u2019s decision to stop visitors to care homes was \u201ca very sensible measure\u201d and that school and kindergarten closures were \u201ca good measure in helping the slowing down\u201d of the virus.</p> \n  <p>\u201cBut then you have to ask who looks after the children,\u201d he said. \u201cThe medical staff is mainly made up of females. So a concept needs to be created as to who will look after the children to allow these people to still be able to work\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Wieler said that between 60-70% of the population would get the virus, due to the fact that it is new, there is no immunity against it, no vaccination against it and no treatment for it\u201d and that \u201cmany many people\u201d will have had it already without knowing it, and will have already recovered. Those numbers are unquantifiable, but the more people who get it, long term, the better, as that will increase the immunity levels.</p> \n  <p>Four-fifths of people will get it very mildly with many not even realising they have it, he added. </p> \n  <p>One fifth will suffer serious symptoms. That could still amount to millions of people being severely ill at once, hence the repeated stress by health officials on slowing down its stress.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6b72be8f088d7575592b2f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/rorycarroll\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-13T11:49:21.690Z\">11.49am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ireland\">Ireland</a> is to swear in around 325 trainee police officers next week to boost frontline policing as the country adapts to a partial lockdown to delay the spread of coronavirus, reports <strong>Rory Carroll</strong> in Dublin.<br></p> \n  <p>An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na, the name of the force, announced on Friday that it would also defer training until further notice and reassign tutors and instructors to operational roles.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"89b19b71739c197854469582c9923bb2e7d3d274\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89b19b71739c197854469582c9923bb2e7d3d274/0_0_3500_2337/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Garda Commissioner Drew Harris holds press conference on coronavirus outside Garda headquarters in Dublin\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Garda Commissioner Drew Harris holds press conference on coronavirus outside Garda headquarters in Dublin</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Lawless/PA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>The commissioner, Drew Harris, has restricted annual leave and asked senior officers who were due to retire soon to stay on in the national interest.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe commissioner has designated the ongoing situation as an \u2018exceptional event\u2019, the force said in a statement.</p> \n  <p>Additional duties include showing a visible police presence at shops and pharmacies which have been the scene of panic buying since the government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/ireland-school-closures-reveal-stark-contrast-to-uk-covid-19-response\">announced restrictions on Thursday</a>.

It is unclear why her positive test result for COVID-19 was only added to official infection rates following her death. The Egyptian Ministry of Health subsequently reported 80 total infections since mid-February, including 20 they say have since recovered and left hospital. </p> \n  <p>The death of the woman in Mansoura is the second death in Egypt, the most populous country in the Middle East. A German tourist transferred from Luxor to a hospital in the resort town Hurghada died last Sunday from the virus. </p> \n  <p>The outbreak in Mansoura shows that the virus is spreading inside Egypt. \u201cThe 13 new coronavirus cases include six who showed no symptoms and had contracted the virus after coming into contact with people who previously tested positive,\u201d said government-owned outlet Al-Ahram.</p> \n  <p>Egypt\u2019s health ministry continued to update the number of official cases, but has not regularly named the location of infections. The country\u2019s minister for education announced earlier this week that schools were banned from trips in the governorates of Luxor, Aswan and Hurghada due to outbreaks of the virus. </p> \n  <p>The ministry also announced that a school in the central district of Zamalek would close and parents and teachers self-isolate for a fortnight \u201cas a precautionary measure, after a parent of one of the school students was in contact with a foreigner who tested positive for coronavirus.\u201d <br></p> \n  <p>As the disease shows signs of spreading, some in Cairo attempted to retain a sense of business as usual even as Egypt was battered by a freak storm forcing many to stay indoors.

On Friday he paraded a series of major US companies entering into a public-private partnership in order to fix the shortfall.</p> \n<p>Trump said his team expected \u201chalf a million additional tests will be available early next week which will bring probably 1.4m tests next week and 5m in a month. Our overriding goal is to stop the spread of the virus.\u201d</p> \n<p>He could not resist adding: \u201cOur overriding goal is to stop the spread of the virus and to help all Americans who have been impacted by this. Again, we don\u2019t want everybody taking this test. It\u2019s totally unnecessary. This will pass.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump chose not to adopt a German-made test approved by the World Health Organisation (WHO) but when questioned by reporters he refused to take the blame for the US now having to play catch-up.</p> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t take responsibility at all,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause we were given a set of circumstances and we were given rules, regulations and specifications from a different time.\u201d</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cWhat we\u2019ve done is redesign it very quickly with the help of the people around me \u2026 We\u2019ll have the ability to do millions over a quick period of time.\u201d</p> \n<p>The US military said later on Friday that it would halt all domestic travel, with some exceptions, for service members, defense department civilians and their families amid the fast-spreading coronavirus.</p> \n<p>The memo, signed by defense deputy secretary David Norquist, said the policy would go into effect on Monday through 11 May.</p> \n<p>It added that exceptions could be granted for mission essential travel, travel necessary for humanitarian reasons, and travel warranted due to extreme hardship.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"5b86d89c-98d6-4d80-ba4b-9c7affda275f\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NezEbDx4B9A?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Trump also announced that he would waive interest on all student loans held by government agencies until further notice and was buying big quantities of crude oil for storage in the US strategic reserve.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a good time to fill it up,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>The vice-president, Mike Pence; Dr Anthony Fauci; the health secretary, Alex Azar; and other members of the coronavirus taskforce stood behind Trump.

We need to anticipate significant increases in hospital admissions, which means that we will need more ICU units and ventilators, we will need more doctors, nurses, and medical personnel of all kinds - and we must make sure that these frontline personnel are well protected from the diseases they are treating. I have talked to nurses recently who worry very much about whether they are getting the kind of knowledge and equipment they need so that they do not get sick.</em></p> \n   <p><em>We need to significantly improve our communications and collaboration with other countries to ensure that we are learning everything that we can about the successes and failures of other countries as they deal with this crisis. And furthermore, we must be honest with the American people and communicate as effectively and directly as we can with all of the scientific information that we can provide.</em><em>Further, and most importantly, our response to this entire crisis must be guided by the decisions of doctors, scientists, and researchers, not politicians. </em></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>And then Sanders pivoted to his signature issue, healthcare. He argued that the crisis is a reason the country needs to adopt Medicare for All. </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><em>But as we struggle with this crisis, it is also important that we learn the lessons of how we got to where we are today, and what we must do in the future so that we are better prepared for similar crises that may come. </em><em>Poll after poll already shows us that the American people understand that we must do what every other major country on earth does, and that is to guarantee healthcare to all of our people as a human right, not a privilege. As we begin to see the failures and vulnerabilities of the current healthcare system, my guess is that those numbers and the demand for universal healthcare will only go up.</em> </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6bf1d88f088d75755931cd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/max-benwell\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-13T20:54:45.674Z\">8.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Here is the <strong>unsettling moment Trump hit out at PBS\u2019 Yamiche Alcindor</strong>, after she asked him about his <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-fire-pandemic-team/\">closure of the White House\u2019s pandemic response team in 2018</a>:</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MarcACaputo/status/1238569990481162240\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Q: What responsibility do you take for disbanding the White House pandemic office<br><br>Trump: \u201cit's a nasty question ... we saved thousands of lives because of the quick closing.

Booker and Harris have since dropped out and endorsed Biden.<br></p> \n  <p>The CBC as a whole is not officially endorsing a candidate, Bass said, but the majority of members have already announced support for Biden.</p> \n  <p>Although Biden has strong support within the African American community, especially among older voters, concerns have been raised about his ability to energize young and progressive voters.</p> \n  <p>\u201cAs this race settles down, it is my job personally and the job of members of the Congressional Black Caucus to be extremely clear with people in our districts what is at stake here, and what is at stake is their future,\u201d Bass said. \u201cIt\u2019s a job that we\u2019ve all been doing over the last 3 1/2 years, but we have to step it up.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>Asked whether Sanders and Tulsi Gabbard should drop out of the race to unite the party before the Democratic National Convention, Bass said she believes the primary process needs to run its course and allow every voter the chance to weigh in.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cI would never be in a position to say, \u2018You need to drop out,\u2019\u201d Bass said. \u201cI do think, though, that math is math.\u201d<br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6b73788f085c6327bbf37e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-13T11:51:22.103Z\">11.51am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was on CBS This Morning talking about the coronavirus, and particularly about the availability - or lack of - testing kits in the US.
