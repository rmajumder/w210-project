  "<p>The Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, has declared an end to security cooperation with the Israel and the United States, citing the imminent threat of Israeli annexation of parts of the West Bank.</p> <p>\u201cThe Palestine Liberation Organization [PLO] and the state of Palestine are absolved, as of today, of all the agreements and understandings with the American and Israeli governments and of all the commitments based on these understandings and agreements, including the security ones,\u201d Abbas said <a href=\"http://english.wafa.ps/page.aspx?id=cBrJbOa117154132029acBrJbO\">in his speech</a>.</p> <p>The PLO voted to end cooperation with Israel and the US in 2018 and left it up to Abbas when to implement such a move. The Palestinian Authority (PA) president has threatened to stop such cooperation several times before, and it was unclear on Tuesday what his declaration would mean in practice, especially in terms of the future of the Palestinian security apparatus.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/17/netanyahu-takes-office-in-deal-that-could-see-west-bank-annexation\">Netanyahu takes office in deal that could see West Bank annexation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cTo pass the bar of credibility as a threat, to show this is not the same as the umpteen threats that they\u2019ve previously issued of a similar nature and that they never acted on, the bar is very high,\u201d said Daniel Levy, the president of the <a href=\"https://www.usmep.us/\">US/Middle East Project</a> \u201cWe will actually have to see Palestinian action.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.kan.org.il/item/?itemId=71348\">Some reports</a> from Israel suggested that Palestinian security officials had been ordered to stop talking to their Israeli counterparts. But Palestinian officials have to coordinate with Israeli officers even to move between areas within the West Bank.</p> <p>Abbas\u2019s declaration follows the creation of a new Israeli government which is officially contemplating annexation of some areas of the West Bank, apparently with the support of the Trump administration.</p> <p>\u201cI do think this moment is qualitatively different than any other moment in the past, and that\u2019s because Israel does look like it is prepared to annex some part of the West Bank,\u201d Zaha Hassan, a human rights lawyer and visiting fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said.</p> <p>\u201cNot only is there nobody to stop Israel from moving forward, but also the US is a partner to this plan.\u201d</p> <p>According to Israeli Channel 13 television, the Israeli ambassador to the US, Ron Dermer, had been <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-envoy-said-trying-to-get-us-okay-for-swift-annexation-biden-could-win/\">urging annexation</a> before the US elections in November.</p> <p>\u201cWe must advance annexation now because we don\u2019t know what will happen in the US presidential elections. [Democratic candidate Joe] Biden could win,\u201d Dermer is reported to have said in confidential briefings in Washington.</p> <p>\u201cThere is a window of opportunity now, so it must be done now.\u201d</p> <p>Jordan\u2019s King Abdullah <a href=\"https://thearabweekly.com/king-abdullah-jordan-warns-massive-conflict-if-israel-proceeds-annexation\">warned on Saturday</a> that Israeli annexation could lead to \u201ca massive conflict\u201d between his country and Israel and did not exclude a suspension of the 1994 peace treaty between them.</p> <p>Abbas\u2019s declaration could lead to the end of intelligence sharing between Palestinian, Israeli and US security services. But it gave no hint of what Palestinian forces would do, when Israeli soldiers carry out incursions into Palestinian areas, or what it would mean for Palestinian movement around the West Bank between parts entirely administered by the PA (Area A), jointly run areas (B) and Israeli settlement zones (Area C).</p> <p>\u201cWhat does it mean on the ground for PA security who \u2013 even to travel from area B to area B, through Area C \u2013 have to get permission from the Israeli army. Does that mean that if everything is frozen, that PA security can\u2019t access certain parts of Area B,\u201d asked Khaled Elgindy, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute in Washington.</p> <p>\u201cThese are the kinds of questions that I think Palestinians will be asking, and then the Israelis, but I\u2019m not sure there are clear answers.\u201d</p>",

Malpass said his bank had so far loaned money to about 100 countries, accounting for 70% of the world\u2019s population.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>The World Health Organization\u2019s annual assembly passed a resolution on the need to investigate the global response to the pandemic</strong>. None of the WHO\u2019s 194 member states raised objections to the resolution brought by the EU on behalf of more than 100 countries.</li> \n   <li><strong>The UK reported 545 more deaths, taking its total to 35,341</strong>. The environment secretary, George Eustice, announced the latest figure at the government\u2019s daily briefing on the epidemic. The UK remains the world\u2019s second-worst affected country by deaths after the US.</li> \n   <li><strong>Rishi Sunak, the UK\u2019s chancellor, said the country is facing \u201ca severe recession the likes of which we haven\u2019t seen\u201d</strong>. Giving evidence to the Lords economic affairs committee, he said he expects the unemployment rate to be in double figures by the end of the year.</li> \n   <li><strong>Cambridge University will not hold traditional lectures in the 2020/21 academic year.</strong>There will be no \u201cface-to-face lectures\u201d at the University of Cambridge in the 2020/21 academic year, the institution has said.

The health ministry confirmed 581 new cases out of 1,200 tests, marking the country\u2019s worst day of the crisis \u2013 the previous high was 414.</li> \n   <li><strong>The border between Canada and the US will remain closed</strong> to non-essential travel until 21 June. The closure was set to expire this week after the two governments announced a 30-day extension of the restrictions last month.</li> \n   <li><strong>Spain reported a death toll below 100 for the third consecutive day</strong>, confirming 83 deaths from coronavirus in the past 24 hours. The latest figures from the health ministry showed the majority of the latest deaths were in some of the hardest-hit areas of the country.</li> \n   <li><strong>The Al-Aqsa mosque, Islam\u2019s third holiest site, will reopen next week</strong>, authorities said. The Islamic endowment overseeing the site in Jerusalem under Jordanian custodianship had taken the unprecedented step of closing it to worshippers in March.</li> \n   <li><strong>People living within a kilometre of Barcelona\u2019s beaches will be able to return to the sand from Wednesday</strong>, as the local lockdown eases.

It has been licensed for use in the US since the mid 1950s and is listed by the World Health Organization as an \u201cessential\u201d medicine.</p> \n  <h2><strong>What\u2019s the state of the current evidence?</strong><br></h2> \n  <p>In May, the British Medical Journal reported on a randomised (although still problematic) clinical trial in China that found little evidence hydroxychloroquine worked, with serious adverse events noted in two patients.</p> \n  <p>A second study reported in the BMJ last week on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/vital-drug-people-lupus-coronavirus-covid-19-link-hydroxychloroquine\">French trial</a> also concluded that hydroxychloroquine does not significantly reduce admission to intensive care or improve survival rates in patients hospitalised with pneumonia owing to Covid-19. Overall, 89% of those who received hydroxychloroquine survived after 21 days, compared with 91% in the control group.</p> \n  <p>The US Food and Drug Administration in a safety alert issued on 24 April warned that it had received reports that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine could have serious side-effects and that the drugs should be taken only under the close supervision of a doctor in a hospital setting or a clinical trial.</p> \n  <h2>What are the risks in taking hydroxychloroquine?</h2> \n  <p>There are several side-effects. The most serious is that it can interfere with the rhythm of the heart. Other side-effects include headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, skin rash or itching or hair loss.

Other images showed doctors and nurses protesting about the lack of PPE, medicines and oxygen. </p> \n  <p>At least 45 members of the 30,000-strong Shipibo Konibo indigenous people have died from the coronavirus in Ucayali, the Amazon region of which Pucallpa is the capital, according to the local indigenous federation <a href=\"https://twitter.com/feconau1/status/1262055749380902914\">Feconau</a>.

A cylinder which cost about 600 soles (\u00a3144) before the pandemic began now costs between 3,500 soles (\u00a3843) and 5,000 soles (\u00a31,205).</p> \n  <p>\u201cI put money towards buying a ridiculously expensive cylinder of oxygen because I\u2019m trying to save a friend\u2019s life,\u201d said Bennett. \u201cBut it\u2019s absolutely disgusting that this should happen.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Peru\u2019s state social security body EsSalud said last week it expected to build a 100-bed field hospital in Pucallpa for Covid-19 patients which would be ready in three weeks.</p> \n  <p>Official figures for Ucayali report <a href=\"https://covid19.minsa.gob.pe/sala_situacional.asp\">2,032 coronavirus cases and 91 deaths</a> but local accounts report hundreds of deaths.

<p>Donald Trump has threatened to cut funding to the World Health Organization permanently and even pull the US out of the global body altogether unless it makes \u201cmajor substantive improvements\u201d which the president did not explain.</p> \n  <p>On Monday night, the president published the letter, citing a timeline of the organisation\u2019s alleged failings, which was based on a selective version of the pandemic, highlighting where the WHO had publicised Chinese findings on the nature of the disease, but ignoring or glossing over clear warnings from the organisation about the dangers of the contagion.</p> \n  <p>The move came hours after the US president told reporters <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/18/trump-taking-hydroxychloroquine-covid-19-fda-warnings\">he had been taking hydroxychloroquine for a couple of weeks</a>, despite warnings from

of words between Trump and the WHO that has unfolded in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.

At the time, critics were stunned at the move to cut money from a critical UN agency during a global pandemic.</p> \n  <p>Before Trump\u2019s letter, Tedros acknowledged there had been shortcomings and told the virtual assembly he welcomed calls for a review. \u201cI will initiate an independent evaluation at the earliest appropriate moment to review experience gained and lessons learned, and to make recommendations to improve national and global pandemic preparedness and response,\u201d he said. \u201cBut one thing is abundantly clear.

The ambiguity stems from unreliable data, as Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/17/a-tall-tale-accuracy-of-trumps-medical-report-and-new-height-questioned\">tends to exaggerate</a> his height and <a href=\"https://www.kansascity.com/news/nation-world/article195077804.html\">lowball</a> his weight.</p> \n<p>The FDA <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-cautions-against-use-hydroxychloroquine-or-chloroquine-covid-19-outside-hospital-setting-or\">advised</a> in April that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/19/hydroxychloroquine-trump-and-covid-19-what-you-need-to-know\">hydroxych</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/19/hydroxychloroquine-trump-and-covid-19-what-you-need-to-know\">loroquine</a> and chloroquine \u201chave not been shown to be safe and effective for treating or preventing Covid-19\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhile clinical trials are ongoing to determine the safety and effectiveness of these drugs for Covid-19, there are known side effects of these medications that should be considered,\u201d the FDA commissioner, Stephen Hahn, said then.</p> \n<p>The FDA has not updated that guidance.

  "<p>Sean Conley, the doctor who acceded to Donald Trump\u2019s request to be given a drug unproven to treat the coronavirus, is a US navy veteran and is qualified in osteopathic medicine.</p> <p>Conley, who is from Pennsylvania, graduated from the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine in 2006 and went on to <a href=\"https://www.navy.mil/submit/display.asp?story_id=75129\">undertake</a> a medical residency at a navy base in Virginia. He was then deployed to Afghanistan, where he acted as head of a trauma unit at a Nato base. </p> <p>The medical unit at the White House is typically staffed by doctors drawn from the US military and Conley found himself in line to become the president\u2019s own physician after the departure of Ronny Jackson, who had previously raised eyebrows by praising Trump\u2019s \u201cgood genes\u201d and for saying that if the president had had \u201ca healthier diet over the last 20 years, he might live to be 200 years old\u201d.</p> <p>Jackson had also sparked a short-lived \u201cgirther\u201d conspiracy movement after reporting Trump\u2019s weight as 239lb, just 1lb below a threshold that would class the president as obese. Trump sleeps just four or five hours a night, doesn\u2019t exercise outside rounds of golf and is fond of McDonald\u2019s but is fit enough for a second term, Jackson reported in 2018.</p> <p>The position of presidential physician, formally established by Congress in 1928, is usually a low-profile and uneventful one.

Ruge recalled having little to do for his only patient, spending state dinners in his office wearing formal dress doing crossword puzzles, in case an emergency arose.</p> <p>Conley, who became the president\u2019s physician in May 2018, had also largely steered clear of public attention until Trump\u2019s extraordinary claim that he has been taking hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug.</p> <p>Trump has repeatedly touted the drug as a treatment for Covid-19, despite it not having gone through any clinical trials or approvals for this use. The Food and Drug Administration has warned against taking the drug outside a clinical trial or emergency hospital intervention, citing potential heart problems.</p> <p>Despite these warnings, and the fact Trump has not tested positive for Covid-19, Conley wrote a <a href=\"https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/6959-letter-from-white-house-physic/e3e29d81b7d6339b9f56/optimized/full.pdf#page=1\">memo</a> stating that following discussions with the president they concluded that the \u201cpotential benefit from treatment outweighed the relative risks\u201d of taking hydroxychloroquine.</p> <p>Conley also confirmed in the memo that Trump is in good health.</p> <p>Describing his consultation with Conley, Trump said on Monday: \u201cI asked him \u2018what do you think?\u2019 He said \u2018Well, if you\u2019d like it.\u2019 I said \u2018Yeah, I\u2019d like it.

The US wished to include language on incentivising innovation that would give companies guarantees about profits from vaccines.</p> \n<p>The medical journal the Lancet, which was incorrectly mentioned in Trump\u2019s letter as having published a report on the virus in late 2019, issued a statement setting the record straight on Tuesday.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis statement is factually incorrect,\u201d the Lancet said. \u201cThe Lancet published no report in December 2019, referring to a virus or outbreak in Wuhan or anywhere else in China \u2026 The allegations levelled against the WHO in President Trump\u2019s letter are serious and damaging to efforts to strengthen international cooperation to control this pandemic. It is essential that any review of the global response is based on a factually accurate account of what took place in December and January.\u201d</p> \n<p>EU diplomats, aware that the WHO has become a stage prop in Trump\u2019s re-election campaign, have been focusing on trying to minimise the US-China clash at the assembly, and still hope the compromise resolution can minimise the damage, and possibly pave the way for Trump to delay a final break from the WHO.</p> \n<p>In Brussels, the EU threw its weight behind the WHO, urging all countries to support it in the wake of Trump\u2019s continued attacks. \u201cThis is the time for solidarity,\u201d said the European commission\u2019s spokeswoman Virginie Battu-Henriksson. \u201cIt is not the time for finger-pointing or undermining multilateral cooperation.</p> \n<p>Welcoming what had been a victory for EU diplomacy, the bloc\u2019s foreign affairs chief, Josep Borrell, pointedly distanced himself from Trump\u2019s criticisms, saying: \u201cThe resolution underlines the importance of responding to this crisis through solidarity and multilateral cooperation under the umbrella of the United Nations. We commend the WHO for its leading role in guiding the response to this crisis.\u201d</p> \n<p>He reiterated the EU\u2019s call for vaccine research to be shared and said the WHO would hold a lessons learned inquiry.</p> \n<p>The WHO regularly conducts reviews into its handling of major epidemics, so the real battle if the US stays in the UN body would be over issues such as the precise terms of reference and the identity of the inquiry chair.</p> \n<p>The loss of US funding to the WHO would be a severe blow since the US contributed more than $400m to the WHO in 2019, or about 15% of its budget. WHO funding is in need of reform since the overstretched body is heavily dependent on one-off voluntary contributions from nations and philanthropists such as the Gates Foundation. Many European states share the desire to reform the WHO, but find Trump\u2019s threats counterproductive since they only entrench Chinese influence with Africa, and make the reform cause harder.</p> \n<p>Overall, China seemed content with the WHA\u2019s direction, sensing that the US tactics had left Trump increasingly isolated. </p> \n<p>China\u2019s foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, described Trump\u2019s letter as slanderous. \u201cThe US leadership\u2019s open letter is \u2026 trying to mislead the public \u2026 to achieve the goal of smearing and slandering China\u2019s efforts in epidemic prevention and to shift responsibility in its own incompetence in handling the epidemic,\u201d Zhao said. </p> \n<p>The US decided not to resist the resolution, but put out a statement disassociating itself from a section in the resolution that favoured equal access to the intellectual property of any coronavirus medicines, such as a vaccine. </p> \n<p>At the White House Trump refused to back down, insisting the WHO will \u201chave to clean up their act, they have to do a better job.

Donald Trump seems to think that if he yells \u201cObamagate\u201d often enough and loud enough, it will magic a scandal into existence and send his arch-nemeses, Barack Obama and Joe Biden, to jail.</p> <p>On Monday, the US attorney general, William Barr, burst his boss\u2019s bubble and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/18/obamagate-investigations-barr-dashes-trump-hopes-obama-biden\">dismissed the possibility</a> of a criminal investigation into Obama or Biden. Because, you know, they didn\u2019t do anything wrong. Trump responded to Barr\u2019s statement in his usual fashion: sulking like a petulant child and saying: \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/thehill/status/1262475642836258818?s=20\">Well, if it was me they would [investigate]</a>\u201d before continuing to babble incoherently.</p> <p>It may be wishful thinking, but I have a feeling that one reason Trump is so keen to accuse Obama and Biden of criminality is because he is starting to get nervous about going to jail himself. Last week, Biden pledged that, if elected president, he wouldn\u2019t use his executive powers to <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/15/joe-biden-pledges-not-to-pardon-trump-2\">pardon Trump of potential crimes</a>. This wasn\u2019t the first time the presumptive Democratic nominee has said he wouldn\u2019t go easy on Trump. In October, Biden told an <a href=\"https://www.radioiowa.com/2019/10/13/biden-says-if-hes-elected-in-2020-he-will-not-pardon-trump/\">Iowa radio station</a> that it had been a mistake for Gerald Ford to pardon his predecessor, Richard Nixon, after Watergate in 1974. Pardoning Trump, Biden said, \u201cwouldn\u2019t unite [the US]\u201d and would send the message that some people are above the law.</p> <p>Of course, as it stands, the US president is above the law. In 1973, amid the Watergate scandal, the Department of Justice adopted the position that a sitting president is \u201c<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-indictment-explainer/can-a-sitting-us-president-face-criminal-charges-idUSKCN1QF1D3\">constitutionally immune</a>\u201d from criminal prosecution, a position it reaffirmed in 2000. As long as he is president, Trump is safe.</p> <p>When he leaves office, however, it is another matter: there are a host of charges he might face. These include <a href=\"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-prison-after-office-mueller-863027/\">obstruction of justice</a> charges in relation to the Russia investigation; illegally withholding military aid to Ukraine in order to pressure them to investigate his political rivals; and soliciting campaign donations from foreign nationals \u2013 all of which Trump denies. According to the investigative site the Intercept, the laws Trump has potentially broken in his interaction with Ukraine and China as president could land him <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2019/10/10/trump-crimes-law/\">10 years in prison</a>.</p> <p>And it is not just Trump\u2019s conduct as president that has opened him to potential legal trouble. There is also the matter of his financial and tax dealings, which are the subject of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/12/supreme-court-donald-trump-tax-returns\">numerous lawsuits</a>.</p> <p>Importantly, how long Trump stays in power has a bearing on any potential legal liability. The statute of limitations on obstruction of justice charges, for example, is only <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-and-obstruction-of-justice-what-is-the-statute-of-limitations-against-donald-trump-2019-07-25/\">five years</a>. So if Trump gets another term, he will run down the clock on that. Honestly, if you want to do the crime without doing the time, it really pays to be president.</p> <p>If Trump ever goes to jail, it will be one of the happiest days of my life. Not everyone is so enthusiastic about \u201clocking him up\u201d, however. Earlier this year, the then Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang said that, if he were president, he <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/02/02/pardon-trump-andrew-yang-2020-110331\">wouldn\u2019t investigate Trump</a>: \u201cIf you look at history around the world, it\u2019s a very, very nasty pattern that developing countries have fallen into, where a new president ends up throwing the president before them in jail.\u201d</p> <p>Look, I understand that the US, where people die because they <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/diabetes-josh-wilkerson-death-age-counter-insulin-cost-lost-private-health-insurance-american-doctor-a9039656.html\">can\u2019t afford diabetes medication</a>, doesn\u2019t want to be like a \u201cdeveloping country\u201d. Nevertheless, there is a very nasty pattern into which authoritarian regimes have fallen, where the leader does whatever they like with no repercussions. I am not sure the US wants to be like that, either.</p> <p>I have no idea what the chances of Trump ending up in prison are, but I am pretty sure he is not happy that there is even a small possibility he might swap the White House for the \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/big_house\">big house</a>\u201d. But his <a href=\"https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/498367-poll-trump-approval-on-economy-jobs-drops-amid-economic-fallout\">approval ratings are dropping</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/17/politics/state-polls-2020-analysis/index.html\">chances of a President Biden are rising</a>. That means Trump is going to do everything he can to win re-election in November; he is not just fighting for another term, he is also fighting for his freedom. He is fighting to avoid the possibility of a Trumpgate.</p> <p>\u2022 Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist</p>",

  "<p>Covid-19 has taken so much from us, but now it\u2019s come for our emojis too.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/19/coronavirus-us-live-trump-taking-hydroxychloroquine-withdraw-who-biden-obama-latest-news-updates\">Coronavirus US live: Trump claims to take hydroxychloroquine and threatens to withdraw US from WHO</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As a result of the global pandemic, the Unicode Consortium, which sets standards for digital typography, has been forced to <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=unicode+consortium+no+new+emojis&amp;oq=unicode+consortium+no+new+emojis&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.7422j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">delay</a> the next set of updates, from March 2021, when they were due to be finalized, until September 2021.</p> <p>That will have a knock-on effect for OS at Apple and Google, who will struggle to implement the new designs on their normal timescale. All of which means that 2021 might see no brand new emojis.</p> <p>That\u2019s more of a hit than it might seem. On an emotional level, the rollout of new emojis is important people who want to represent themselves in the lingua franca of the 21st century. And on a technical level, the pictograms are an important carrot dangled by the smartphone manufacturers to get people to go through the effort of installing software updates, which are crucial to protect users from security vulnerabilities and hacking attacks.</p> <p>But all is not lost. For one thing, the 2020 emoji updates are still on their way: those designs \u2013 including representations of bubble tea, people hugging and the transgender flag \u2013 are making their way through the development process now, and should hit most phones this autumn.</p> <p>And there\u2019s a technical quirk that provides even more hope, says Jeremy Burge, the chief emoji officer of <a href=\"https://emojipedia.org\">Emojipedia</a>. The lack of a new version of the unicode standard means there won\u2019t be any new emojis, but there could still be new emoji <em>sequences</em>.</p> <p>The distinction is that some are technically made up of a combination of others. Take \ud83d\udc77, for instance \u2013 \u201cconstruction worker\u201d. That\u2019s a basic emoji, the type that requires a new version of the Unicode Standard to create. But \ud83d\udc77\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f, a light-skinned male construction worker, is a sequence: even though it looks like one emoji, it\u2019s actually represented by three in a row.</p> <p>Most diversity in human representations is carried out with this technical quirk, but other emojis use the same trick. Add white flag, \ud83c\udff3 and rainbow, \ud83c\udf08 , and you get the rainbow flag: \ud83c\udff3\ufe0f\u200d\ud83c\udf08. Add a dog \ud83d\udc15 and a worker\u2019s vest \ud83e\uddba and you get a service dog: \ud83d\udc15\u200d\ud83e\uddba.</p> <p>\u201cPeople might not be interested in the technical difference between an emoji like \ud83d\udc6e (police officer) and an emoji sequence like \ud83e\uddd1\u200d\ud83d\ude92 (firefighter), as they both look like normal emojis on an emoji keyboard,\u201d Burge says. \u201cBut Unicode can still approve new sequences to roll out next year, and have said they might do this.\u201d</p> <p>That means we definitely won\u2019t be seeing the all-new candidates \u2013 proposals including Vulture, Bubbles, Hand With Index Finger and Thumb Crossed \u2013 before 2022, but could see a limited release with remixes of existing emojis.</p> <p>It\u2019s easy to roll your eyes at the endless march of new emojis, but the system is meaningful for many \u2013 and has been democratised in recent years. The turning point was the introduction of the dumpling emoji in 2017, following a campaign by journalist Jennifer 8 Lee and her friend Yiying Lu.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact there was no dumpling emoji told me whatever system was in place had failed,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90136118/how-the-dumpling-democratized-emoji\">Lee told Forbes magazine</a>, citing the universality of the food, which has its own native equivalents in countries from Italy to Japan. She began a campaign to join the Unicode Consortium, and crowdfunded the entry fee, becoming the first member of the group to have joined with the express intention of creating emoji for the people.</p> <p>In the meantime, we can at least be glad that the slowdown means we won\u2019t have to deal with emoji added specifically in relation to what\u2019s happening in the world right now. We\u2019re already seeing unprecedented use of the microbe emoji \ud83e\udda0 and the face with medical mask \ud83d\ude37, according to an analysis Burge carried out in the first week of the crisis; that should do for the time being. It\u2019s not like you can use emoji on a Zoom call anyway.</p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump has threatened to cut funding to the World Health Organization permanently and even pull the US out of the global body altogether unless it makes \u201cmajor substantive improvements\u201d which the president did not explain.</p> <p>In a four-page letter to the WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Trump claimed the organisation had shown an \u201calarming lack of independence\u201d from China and accused Tedros of presiding over \u201crepeated missteps \u2026 that have been extremely costly for the world\u201d. The letter, he said, followed a US investigation into the WHO\u2019s \u201cfailed response to the Covid-19 outbreak\u201d.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s threat came on the day the WHO member states <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/who-to-agree-deal-over-future-coronavirus-inquiry\">met for the first day of a two-day virtual assembly</a>. Tedros had invited both Trump and Xi Jinping to speak, in the hope of resolving differences between the two leaders on handling the outbreak, but Trump did not take part.</p> <p>On Tuesday the WHO members states are set to agree to an independent investigation \u2013 put forward in a resolution by the EU \u2013 into how the coronavirus was handled.</p> <p>On Monday night, the president published the letter, citing a timeline of the organisation\u2019s alleged failings, which was based on a selective version of the pandemic, highlighting where the WHO had publicised Chinese findings on the nature of the disease, but ignoring or glossing over clear warnings from the organisation about the dangers of the contagion.</p> <p>The move came hours after the US president told reporters <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/18/trump-taking-hydroxychloroquine-covid-19-fda-warnings\">he had been taking hydroxychloroquine for a couple of weeks</a>, despite warnings from his administration that it is dangerous. \u201cI think it\u2019s good, I heard a lot of good stories \u2026 I take a pill every day,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Some claims in Trump\u2019s letter were false, for example that Taiwan had warned about human-to-human transmission of the disease on 31 December. On that date Taiwan sent a letter to the WHO noting the reported spate of unexplained pneumonia cases in Wuhan, China, and that the patients were in isolation, and asking for further details.</p> <p>As the pandemic worsens in the US, and other countries begin a tentative recovery, Trump has sought to blame China and the WHO. He has suspended US funding to the organisation, pointing to the disparity between US and much smaller Chinese contributions and accusing Tedros and his team of being \u201cChina-centric\u201d.</p> <p>Trump ended the letter with an ultimatum.</p> <p>\u201cWe do not have time to waste,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThat is why it is my duty as president of the United States to inform you that if the World Health Organization does not commit to major substantive improvements within the next 30 days, I will make my temporary freeze of the United States funding to the World Health Organization permanent and reconsider membership in the organization. I cannot allow American taxpayer dollars to continue to finance an organization that, in its present state, is so clearly not serving America\u2019s interests.\u201d</p> <p>Trump did not make clear what \u201csubstantive improvements\u201d the US wanted to see. The US health and human services department has circulated a discussion document with other member states that was largely seen as moderate, calling for the WHO\u2019s powers of inspection to be strengthened, for example. Similar proposals were included in a resolution that appeared to have majority support at Monday\u2019s World Health Assembly.</p> <p>However, some US officials have suggested more drastic measures, such as making the WHO emergency programme semi-autonomous from the main organisation. That would be seen as unpalatable by many member states.</p> <p>\ufeffChina hit back on Tuesday, describing the letter as slanderous. \u201cThe US leadership\u2019s open letter is \u2026 trying to mislead the public \u2026 to achieve the goal of smearing and slandering China\u2019s efforts in epidemic prevention and to shift responsibility in its own incompetence in handling the epidemic,\u201d Zhao Lijian, a foreign ministry spokesman, told a regular briefing.</p> <p>A WHO spokeswoman in Geneva said the agency had no immediate comment but expected to have \u201cmore clarity\u201d and a reaction to it later in the day.</p> <p>The letter is the latest salvo in a war of words between Trump and the WHO that has unfolded in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. The US president, who is under pressure at home over his response to the pandemic, temporarily <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/coronavirus-trump-halts-funding-to-world-health-organization\">froze funding to the WHO</a> in April, accusing the global body of \u201cseverely mismanaging and covering up\u201d the threat. At the time, critics were stunned at the move to cut money from a critical UN agency during a global pandemic.</p> <p>Before Trump\u2019s letter, Tedros acknowledged there had been shortcomings and told the virtual assembly he welcomed calls for a review. \u201cI will initiate an independent evaluation at the earliest appropriate moment to review experience gained and lessons learned, and to make recommendations to improve national and global pandemic preparedness and response,\u201d he said. \u201cBut one thing is abundantly clear. The world must never be the same.\u201d</p> <p>The letter came as deaths from coronavirus in the US passed 90,000. The US also has the most cases of Covid-19 in the world (1,508,168), followed by <strong>Russia</strong> and <strong>Brazil.</strong></p> <p>On Monday Brazil jumped into third place \u2013 overtaking Britain \u2013 after the health ministry announced 13,140 new cases. Russia now has a total of 255,368 cases and 674 new deaths.</p> <p>Brazil\u2019s economic policy secretary, Adolfo Sachsida, said April, May, June and July would be the worst months of the coronavirus crisis, and from August the economy would be able to pick up again.</p> <p>Deaths across Latin America have passed 30,000, representing just under 10% of global fatalities</p> <p> The global economy will take much longer to recover fully from the shock caused by the new coronavirus than initially expected, the head of the International Monetary Fund said, and she stressed the danger of protectionism.</p> <p>The IMF managing director, Kristalina Georgieva, said the fund was likely to revise downward its forecast for a 3% contraction in GDP in 2020, but gave no details. That would likely also trigger changes in the fund\u2019s forecast of a partial recovery of 5.8% in 2021.</p> <p>In other coronavirus developments:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>China</strong> reported six new cases, including three imported cases.

But once he starts to cross ethical lines \u2013 a little bribery here, a little rape there \u2013 she realizes she needs to live her own life.

Rodham and Steinem share similar obstacles to their ascension, which are mostly just micro-aggressions rather than anything structural. Romantic partners are not supportive, male colleagues underestimate them, they have to meet unfair standards of beauty and decorum. But each woman is, deep down, a good girl. They only get angry about injustice, they are only ambitious for change (vaguely defined). The mistakes they make along the way \u2013 in both cases this involves sidelining a woman of color, Shirley Chisholm for Steinem and Carol Moseley Braun for Rodham \u2013 are not about any character flaw, they\u2019re about the greater good and a little naivete. These women are powerful, yet harmless.</p> <p>These are self-empowerment fantasies, which have always been a popular form of women\u2019s entertainment. But instead of dreaming of being a sex columnist with great shoes and an impossible apartment in a New York City before it was just a collection of CVSes and bank branches, now I guess we\u2019re dreaming of being a woman who wants to be president but doesn\u2019t want to be seen wanting to be president, like the girl who dreams of being homecoming queen, but would never try to be homecoming queen by actually campaigning, she just really hopes that everyone in her school wants her to be homecoming queen and will spontaneously vote for her because she deserves it and she can wear her crown with grateful surprise and a pure heart.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Depicting women who have who have compromised basic human decency as just doing their best is not only objectionable, it\u2019s boring</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But politics is not about self-actualization. Becoming president is not the top of the Maslow Hierarchy of Needs; it\u2019s not the reward for being a really good person or making all of the right romantic choices, such as leaving your marriage after the first rape allegation against your husband and not like the eighth or whatever. Politics is about the distribution of resources, and those resources, whether it\u2019s money or food or bombs, decides who in our society lives and who dies, who has abundance and who barely scrapes by.</p> <p>Depicting women who have real ambition, who long for power, who have compromised any basic human decency to defend the activities of the CIA in the 1950s and 60s or destabilize governments in order to maintain that power, as just doing their best is not only objectionable, it\u2019s boring. Plus, I read in Rodham a fictionalized Bill Clinton referring to the fictionalized Hillary\u2019s fictionalized vagina as a \u201choneypot\u201d and I think I lost consciousness for a minute or two.</p> <p>In Rodham, a mentor gives Hillary a little pep talk. \u201cIf you\u2019re not the beneficiary of the women\u2019s movement, who is? More than any other young woman I know, you have the freedom to choose your own path.\u201d Like our dancing Gloria, whose abortionist really just wants what is best for her, this Hillary and her creator seem to understand feminism, instead of being an ideology of true equality and dignity, as being about letting women do whatever they want.

  "<p>Donald Trump has reignited a controversy over the antimalarial drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/18/trump-taking-hydroxychloroquine-covid-19-fda-warnings\">telling reporters </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/18/trump-taking-hydroxychloroquine-covid-19-fda-warnings\"> he was taking the latter</a> to protect himself against coronavirus. What do we know about these drugs?</p> \n<h2><strong>What is </strong>hydroxychloroquine<strong>?</strong></h2> \n<p>Hydroxychloroquine, which Trump says <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/18/trump-taking-hydroxychloroquine-covid-19-fda-warnings\">he has been taking</a> for about two weeks, was developed as an antimalarial but it is also used to treat conditions like lupus, an anti-immune disease, and arthritis, where it can help combat inflammation. It has been licensed for use in the US since the mid 1950s and is listed by the World Health Organization as an \u201cessential\u201d medicine.</p> \n<h2>What is the link to Covid-19?</h2> \n<p>Researchers have been interested in chloroquines as an anti-viral agent for some time. A study in <a href=\"https://virologyj.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1743-422X-2-69\">Virology Journal in 2005</a> found that chloroquine inhibited the closely related Sars virus in primate cells in lab conditions.</p> \n<p>However, evidence for the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine in recent human trials during the coronavirus pandemic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/hydroxychloroquine-coronavirus-scientific-studies-research\">has been at best inconclusive</a>, with some suggestions that it could worsen the outcome of severe cases.</p> \n<p>The WHO is looking at whether hydroxychloroquine could be an effective Covid-19 treatment, while the US National Institutes for Health is also running a clinical trial to establish whether the drug, administered together with the antibiotic azithromycin, can prevent hospitalisation and death from Covid-19.</p> \n<p>In recent days, enthusiasm about hydroxychloroquine has been boosted by a study, which has yet to be peer-reviewed, that looked at the combination of hydroxychloroquine, the antibiotic <a href=\"https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/azithromycin/\">azithromycin</a> and zinc supplements.</p> \n<p>It showed that patients who received the three-drug combination vs the two-drug combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were 44% less likely to die than the second group. Joseph Rahimian, a co-author of the study, pointed out that the study\u2019s findings were limited to the possible promise of zinc, not of hydroxychloroquine.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/apr/16/hydroxychloroquine-how-did-an-unproven-drug-become-trumps-miracle-cure\">The story behind Trump's 'miracle' drug hydroxychloroquine \u2013 podcast</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2><strong>What\u2019s the state of the current evidence?</strong></h2> \n<p>In May, the British Medical Journal reported on a randomised (although still problematic) clinical trial in China that found little evidence hydroxychloroquine worked, with serious adverse events noted in two patients.</p> \n<p>A second study reported in the BMJ last week on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/vital-drug-people-lupus-coronavirus-covid-19-link-hydroxychloroquine\">French trial</a> also concluded that hydroxychloroquine does not significantly reduce admission to intensive care or improve survival rates in patients hospitalised with pneumonia owing to Covid-19. Overall, 89% of those who received hydroxychloroquine survived after 21 days, compared with 91% in the control group.</p> \n<p>The US Food and Drug Administration in a safety alert issued on 24 April warned that it had received reports that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine could have serious side-effects and that the drugs should be taken only under the close supervision of a doctor in a hospital setting or a clinical trial.</p> \n<h2>What are the risks in taking hydroxychloroquine?</h2> \n<p>There are a number of side-effects. The most serious is that it can interfere with the rhythm of the heart. Other side-effects include headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain, skin rash or itching or hair loss. Research published by the Mayo Clinic has suggested that \u201coff-label\u201d repurposing of drugs such as hydroxychloroquine could lead to \u201cdrug-induced sudden cardiac death\u201d.</p> \n<p>Although Trump\u2019s official physician has said he was in \u201cvery good health\u201d at his last official checkup, the president is 73 and his recorded weight would put him in a BMI category of \u201cclinically obese\u201d.</p> \n<h2>So why is Trump taking it?</h2> \n<p>Despite there being no conclusive body of evidence that it can be effective when used to prevent contracting coronavirus, the president apparently decided in conversation with the White House physician Sean P Conley that it was worth the risks.</p> \n<p>\u201cAfter numerous discussions he and I had for and against the use of hydroxychloroquine we concluded the potential benefit from treatment outweighed the relative risks,\u201d Conley wrote.</p> \n<p>It is probably worth pointing out that Conley, a naval doctor, trained initially as an osteopath and then in emergency medicine, serving as research director at Portsmouth Navy Department of Emergency Medicine prior to his assignment to the White House medical unit.</p> \n<p>For his part, Trump, despite the FDA and other warnings, said: \u201cI think it\u2019s good. I\u2019ve heard a lot of good stories. And if it\u2019s not good, I\u2019ll tell you right. I\u2019m not going to get hurt by it. It\u2019s been around for 40 years.\u201d</p> \n<h2>Have we been here before?</h2> \n<p>Yes. Trump has a history of personally advocating for the use hydroxychloroquine, which he has described as a potential \u201cgame-changer\u201d. Although it has been reported that Trump has a small stake in a French company that makes hydroxychloroquine via an investment fund, this seems to be about Trump\u2019s own hunches and his desire to be both proved right and protected against the disease.</p> \n<p>On Monday, he also claimed lots of doctors were using the drug prophylactically and cited letters he had received from members of the public. As Paul Waldman, a columnist in the Washington Post, has suggested, this is more about Trump\u2019s psychology than anything else.</p> \n<p>\u201cTrump compensates for his own insecurity by working to convince himself and everyone else that the experts don\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about, and he knows more than them about everything,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/04/07/real-reason-trump-is-obsessed-with-hydroxychloroquine/\">Waldman has written</a>.</p>",
  "<p>Love is the great accident. We can fall for the wrong person, or we can have the great good fortune to attach ourselves to the right person, and the strange thing is, we may never know which is which.</p> <p>In Curtis Sittenfeld\u2019s 2008 novel <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/oct/12/fiction\">American Wife</a></em>, a woman\u2019s tough love pulls her husband back from alcoholism and then he becomes president of the United States. That woman is a fictional version of Laura Bush and she sometimes wonders at the amazing, almost casual particularity of her role in history. People seem to blame her: \u201cHis election is my fault, his presidency is my fault, his war is my fault. Why couldn\u2019t I just have let him be an alcoholic? Plenty of wives put up with it every day!\u201d</p> <p>The intersection of the ordinary and the historic made <em>American Wife</em> feel almost Shakespearean; the relationship was destined and domestic and surprisingly sexy. Sittenfeld\u2019s new book, <em>Rodham,</em> undoes destiny, and it tilts toward the political rather than the intimate. This is, in part, because its heroine, Hillary Clinton, is a greater political force than Laura Bush ever was. But also, in <em>Rodham,</em> there is no central marriage. That is the whole point.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The problem is that this fictional Hillary is not as interesting as the proud and private human being we wonder about</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the old days, people used to think Hillary was hitching a ride on Bill\u2019s career \u2013 now it is possible to think that he held a good woman back. <em>Rodham</em> is an account of what might have happened if she had taken one hard look at Bill\u2019s promiscuous nature and run the hell out of the relationship. It is a very exciting conceit; the only pity is that Hillary\u2019s life feels more dull as a result.</p> <p>The first third of the novel is one we know from the history books. The couple meet at Yale, move to San Francisco and then to Fayetteville, where Bill plans to run for office, in Arkansas. In this version, however, Hillary quickly discovers the nature of the man who is the love of her life, and she decides to leave him. \u201cIt was unfathomable that we were hugging a final time, that I was climbing into the car, starting the engine,\u201d she says: and then she does just that.</p> <p>We find the new fictional Hillary in 1991, working as a law professor in Chicago, single and happy enough. Bill has become governor of Arkansas, as he planned to do. At his side is a sweet, soft-spoken, younger wife who wears <em>Little House on the Prairie</em> dresses and cries when challenged on television about his infidelity. This is a version of the famous <em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UqKNgrwK8E\">60 Minutes</a></em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UqKNgrwK8E\"> interview</a>, in which the real Hillary saved Bill\u2019s presidential campaign. When alternate Hillary watches it from her life in Chicago, she thinks her ex-boyfriend\u2019s wife is weak. \u201cBill needed an equal who acted like, even if he\u2019d had affairs, so what?\u201d</p> <p>The game of the speculative part of the book is to consider what might have happened differently and what would have happened anyway, and this is a lot of fun. What is the result of happenstance and what of choice? Some incidents look familiar: the suicide of a colleague, the rise of Obama, the fact of Trump. Sittenfeld teases apart the strands of fate and weaves them together in a slightly altered pattern, but she does not change the personality of the actors, nor can she change society itself. Misogyny is a constant in this fictional Hillary\u2019s life, too, though the men who incite it are crucially different. All through her journey, the book holds a certain dream intact \u2013 that, without Bill, our heroine might have become her proper self.</p> <p>The problem is that this \u201cmore true\u201d Hillary, as voiced in the book, is not as interesting as the challenged, proud and private human being we wonder about when we see her on our television screens. In the novel, we find fictional Hillary single at 40 and relieved that the question of children is now moot. She has latent political ambitions but they remain hidden, even from herself. She thinks like a law professor, and this feels appropriate, though it dampens everything down, somehow. The law is a discourse where passion gets turned into procedure, where things are regularised and made known. This tendency is there from the very beginning. When she and Bill go on their first date, as students at Yale, their reported conversation sounds like a job interview for future greatness.</p> <p>The real Hillary is, of course, a controlled kind of person. She is shown, in the early sections, happily nesting in her student bedsit, alone and in her pyjamas, surrounded by her calendar, to-do list and legal briefs. When the young Bill disturbs this moral, conscientious life, they have a great amount of sex, as students in love are prone to do, but there is none of the joyous specificity that made <em>American Wife</em> such a surprising book. Clinton attracted women with great ease and frequency, but though the word \u201ccharisma\u201d is much used, it is hard to tell what exactly his secret was. And although, in later life, his response to getting found out is one of self-pity and resentment, the discovery of his infidelity as a young man produces an odd, confessional penitence. He wakes Hillary in the middle of the night to say she should leave him. \u201cThe thing that is wrong with me is incurable,\u201d he says. This early, more religious self feels a little unlikely \u2013 a young man who says he needs sex all the time is more usually boasting than crying for help. And this is the problem with real life, because in real life people don\u2019t know what they are doing until it is too late.</p> <p>In real life, it is possible to look at that <em>60 Minutes</em> interview and see a man who is not just interested in sex but in punishing his smart-as-paint wife. Yes, there were telephone calls with Gennifer Flowers. \u201cI think once that I called her when we were together,\u201d he says and his wife manages to hold her expression, before glancing quickly down. Bill would later ring senators from the Oval Office while an intern was servicing him under the desk. Perhaps he was addicted, not to orgasm, but to the pleasures of deceit \u2013 and these pleasures sometimes require being found out. So it is possible to see why Clinton needed a woman like Hillary to cheat on, over and again, and less easy to see what she got out of being punished in this way, apart perhaps from the moral high ground and, with it, a sense of her own superiority. The battle for power was in their marriage long before it was in the world. The real Hillary stayed because that is exactly what she would have done. This fictional Hillary leaves when his philandering spills over into something worse.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/04/rodham-curtis-sittenfeld-hillary-without-bill-clinton-novelist\">Hillary without Bill: Curtis Sittenfeld rewrites Clinton's personal history</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Everyone can have a theory about what happened within the marriage, including people who think it was just a political pact, but one way or the other it was the place where Hillary Rodham Clinton was trapped.

  "<p>Tanzania\u2019s divisive president John Magufuli has said the economy is \u201cmore important than the threat posed by coronavirus\u201d, adding that he wants to reopen the country for tourism despite warnings that Africa could face the next wave of the disease.</p> <p>The comments by Magufuli, who has modelled his populist response on that of Donald Trump and Brazil\u2019s Jair Bolsonaro \u2013 in repeatedly denying the risk of the pandemic to his country \u2013 come amid mounting alarm among Tanzania\u2019s neighbours over his approach. </p> <p>So far there have been 21 officially recorded deaths in Tanzania.</p> <p>Magufuli made the remarks on Sunday during a mass in his hometown of Chato, where he said he intended to keep Tanzania\u2019s borders open with its eight neighbours. The remarks follow a series of statements in recent weeks minimising the threat of coronavirus.</p> <p>In a video the Tanzanian president once again touted natural remedies for coronavirus, saying these had helped his son.</p> <p>\u201cMy own son, after contracting the virus, closed himself in his room, took a lemon and ginger solution before getting well and is even able to do push-ups,\u201d he said in a video that went viral.</p> <p>\u201cWe have had a number of viral diseases, including Aids and measles.

  "<p>The World Health Organization will establish an independent and impartial inquiry into the source and handling of the coronavirus outbreak, once the pandemic is brought under control, a virtual meeting of its annual governing body was set to agree on Tuesday.</p> <p>The proposed inquiry, mirroring previous WHO-led inquiries such as the one following the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ebola\">Ebola outbreak</a> in west Africa, arguably stops short of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/world-health-assembly-what-is-it-and-what-is-the-coronavirus-inquiry-china-taiwan-origins\">fully independent inquiry</a> sought by Australia and the US, but represents a compromise brokered by a powerful alliance led by the European Union and India.</p> <p>The WHO-led inquiry set out in a resolution being put to the UN World Health Assembly on Monday, and negotiated over the past week, is probably less independent and less directed at China\u2019s role in informing the WHO than some critics of China wanted.</p> <p>But the likely terms of reference will give scope to examine China\u2019s cooperation with the WHO and the powers the organisation possesses to demand greater cooperation from member states.</p> <p>The compromise came after the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, told the assembly he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/china-facing-pressure-over-covid-19-and-taiwan-at-world-health-assembly\">supported a comprehensive evaluation</a>, including into the sources and transmission routes of the virus.</p> <p>\u201cChina supports a comprehensive evaluation of the global response to the epidemic after the global epidemic is under control, to sum up experiences and remedy deficiencies,\u201d said Xi. \u201cThis work needs a scientific and professional attitude, and needs to be led by the WHO, and the principles of objectivity and fairness need to be upheld.\u201d</p> <p>He insisted that China had been transparent and open throughout, acting quickly to share information about the disease with the WHO, but said the world needed to be able to respond more quickly in future.</p> <p>Xi also pledged $2bn in financial support over the next two years to help deal with Covid-19, especially in developing countries. China will also make any self-developed Covid-19 vaccines a \u201cpublic good\u201d to help with the efforts to curb the pandemic, he said.</p> <p>Calling the pandemic \u201cthe most serious global public health emergency since the end of the second world war\u201d, Xi said: \u201cAll along we have acted with openness and transparency and responsibility.\u201d</p> <p>He repeatedly directed his remarks to Africa, highlighting how much his country was doing to help the continent develop its health systems and break the shackles of debt.</p> <p>The WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said he would set up the independent evaluation at the earliest appropriate moment, adding that it would look into the responsibility of all actors in good faith. The greatest failing, he said, would be not to seek to learn lessons. Short-term amnesia plagued the world\u2019s approach to global health, he said.</p> <p>Previous WHO inquiries into past pandemics have been hard-hitting, but have tended to shy away from criticising individual countries\u2019 performances, preferring instead to propose structural reforms. The WHO has for years debated the degree of autonomy nation states are allowed in terms of cooperating with WHO advice or recommendations. There is, however, a clear duty to keep the WHO promptly informed of potential pandemics.</p> <p>Any inquiry is unlikely to report before the US presidential election in November, so giving Donald Trump and China latitude to continue to publicise conspiracy theories about the source of the virus.</p> <p>Tedros had invited both Xi and Trump to take part in a virtual summit, but Trump did not respond.</p> <p>\u201cThe idea was to bring the two superpower leaders together in solidarity to fight the pandemic, and to do so at this historic world health assembly, as well as to try to create a sort of rapprochement in the increasing \u2018cold war\u2019 between China and America,\u201d said a source familiar with the invitation.</p> <p>Asked about his lack of response, Trump said at a White House event: \u201cI chose not to make a statement today. I\u2019ll be giving them a statement, sometime in the near future, but ... I think they [the WHO] have done a very sad job in the last period of time.\u201d</p> <p>The US was isolated in its hostility to the WHO, with even its closest ally, Australia, joining the chorus of support for the organisation\u2019s central role in overseeing the global response to the pandemic and calls to end the \u201chit and miss\u201d funding of the UN body. Trump has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/world-health-organization-why-has-trump-suspended-funding\">suspended all payments</a> to the WHO pending a review into its alleged \u201cChina-centric leadership\u201d and ineffectiveness. His aides have been discussing continuing to make a minimal payment so in part to retain influence over any inquiry. Trump said on Monday he would make a decision about WHO funding soon.</p> <p>The US health secretary, Alex Azar, told the assembly that the virus had spun out of control due to the WHO failings.</p> <p>\u201cThere was a failure by this organization to obtain the information that the world needed, and that failure cost many lives,\u201d he claimed.</p> <p>Without naming China, Azar added: \u201cIn an apparent attempt to conceal this outbreak, at least one member state made a mockery of their transparency obligations, with tremendous costs for the entire world.</p> <p>\u201cWe saw that WHO failed at its core mission of information sharing and transparency when member states do not act in good faith. This cannot ever happen again.\u201d</p> <p>In a hard-hitting speech, the UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, said recent weeks had seen many expressions of international solidarity, but very little practical action. \u201cWe are all paying the price for implementing contradictory strategies,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He warned the disease had spread across the world, and was now heading for developing countries where he predicted it would be even more devastating.</p> <p>He said the WHO was irreplaceable and needed enhanced support, arguing: \u201cWe are as strong as the weakest health system.\u201d</p> <p>An inquiry to look back fully into how everyone reacted, he said, should wait until we have turned the page. \u201cNow is not the time,\u201d he insisted, arguing: \u201cNow is the time for unity. We stand together, or we fail.\u201d</p> <p>The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said the only priority worth talking about was ending the disease. The time demanded \u201cfreedom from complacency and unfounded accusations\u201d, a remark that could be directed at Washington\u2019s repeated claim that China may have deliberately spread the virus in the west.</p> <p>Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, threw her support behind the WHO, saying everyone needed to look at the sustainability of its financing.</p>",

Now, under the modified criteria announced Monday, in which counties have to show a rate of 8% positive tests over seven days and a hospitalization rate below 5%, Newsom believes that 53 of the state\u2019s 58 counties could move deeper into phase two if their public health officials so desired. </p> \n  <p>He reiterated again that the decision was up to each individual county. \u201cJust because we are creating the capacity and the availability to move into phase two doesn\u2019t mean every county is ready,\u201d he said. \u201cLA county, as an example, I imagine, will be cautious in that respect.\u201d</p> \n  <p>In California, there have been a total of 78,839 positive cases and 3,261 deaths.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-18T23:32:03.474Z\">at 12.32am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec304d68f0886ce4f5d6046\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-18T22:06:20.864Z\">11.06pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>During the event with restaurant executives, Trump also addressed the investigation into the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo. </strong></p> \n  <p>\u201cHere\u2019s a man that is supposed to be negotiating war and peace with major, major countries with weaponry like the world has never seen before,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cAnd the Democrats and the fake news media, they are interested in a man who is walking their dog.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Trump fired the state department\u2019s inspector general, Steve Linick, on Friday.
