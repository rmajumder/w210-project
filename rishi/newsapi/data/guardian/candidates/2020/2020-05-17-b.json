Talon, a former business magnate who came to power in 2016, has been accused of a crackdown that drove key rivals into exile.</p> <p>Parties allied to the president won all the seats at the polls last year after opposition groups were effectively banned from standing, but turnout was only 25%.

But Benin disregarded the ruling and severed some ties with the court in protest at the decision.</p> <p>Opponents called on voters to boycott the poll over the political situation and the risks from coronavirus. Many among the electorate appeared set to heed the call to stay home given the result looks certain to go in favour of those backing Talon.

and faces, <strong>Quebec</strong> is now debating whether to force everybody to put masks on.</p> <p>As the province <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/13/coronavirus-montreal-canada-hit-hard\">at the centre of Canada\u2019s coronavirus outbreak</a>, Quebec is currently \u201cstrongly recommending\u201d that citizens wear masks \u2013 but the measure will not be mandatory.</p> <p>Asked why not, <strong>Horacio Arruda</strong>, the province\u2019s public health director, told reporters: \u201cYou need to have a good argument for infringing on individual rights for the sake of a collective right.\u201d</p> <p>But such arguments ring hollow to <strong>Nour Farhat</strong>, a Montreal lawyer whose dreams of being a Crown prosecutor were dashed after the Quebec government passed legislation last year barring certain public sector workers from wearing religious symbols at work.</p> <p>The law \u2013 known as <strong>Bill 21</strong> \u2013 mainly affects Muslim women working in education, law and other public sectors. Farhat said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Bill 21 violates the rights of religious minorities without a real or urgent situation. And now that we\u2019re in a real and urgent situation, the premier cares about violating people\u2019s rights.</p> <p>For them, it was always OK to violate the rights of religious minorities.</p> </blockquote> <p>Bill 21 has always permitted masks for medical reasons, and government media representatives say their hesitancy on masks is not related to that law.</p> <p>But head and face coverings carry a certain political weight in Quebec. Recent years have seen multiple instances of people trying to snatch hijabs from women\u2019s heads in the province. </p> <p>And only last year did Montreal <a href=\"https://montrealgazette.com/news/local-news/montrealers-will-be-allowed-to-protest-wearing-masks-as-bylaw-to-be-scrapped/\">reverse a seven-year ban on people wearing masks at protests</a>. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/17/quebec-masks-mandatory-veil-ban-coronavirus\">Quebec ponders making masks mandatory after banning the veil</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5ec12b5f8f0864e579f12827\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-17T12:22:35.029Z\">1.22pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Russia\u2019s virus spread stabilising, health official says</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The growth of new coronavirus cases in <strong>Russia</strong> is stabilising, a top health official has said, as the daily tally fell under 10,000 for the third time this week.<br></p> <p>The country has the world\u2019s second highest number of infections at 281,752, topped only by the <strong>United States</strong>. </p> <p>On Sunday, it announced new cases had dropped below 10,000 for the third day this week at 9,709. </p> <p>The head of Russia\u2019s public health watchdog, <strong>Anna Popova</strong>, said in an interview on Rossiya-1 television: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We\u2019ve moved towards the level of stability that we\u2019ve all been waiting for.</p> <p>I would say that of today, we have halted the growth [in the number of cases].</p> <p>For the last 10 or 11 days now, we haven\u2019t seen additional growth or it\u2019s been very small.</p> <p>Stabilisation can be seen over the whole country.

The leaders of <strong>Italy</strong>, <strong>France</strong>, <strong>Germany</strong> and <strong>Norway</strong>, together with the European commission and council, called earlier this month for any innovative tools, therapeutics or vaccines to be shared equally and fairly.</p> <p>\u201cIf we can develop a vaccine that is produced by the world, for the whole world, this will be a unique global public good of the 21st century,\u201d they said in a statement.</p> <p>The sole resolution before the assembly this year is an EU proposal for a <strong>voluntary patent pool</strong>. Drug and vaccine companies would then be under pressure to give up the monopoly that patents allow them on their inventions, which means they can charge high prices, so that all countries can make or buy affordable versions.</p> <p>In the weeks of negotiations leading up to the meeting, which is scheduled to last for less than a day, there has been a dispute over the language of the resolution. </p> <p>Countries with major pharmaceutical companies argue they need patents to guarantee sufficiently high prices in wealthy nations to recoup their research and development costs.</p> <p>Even more fraught have been attempts to reinforce countries\u2019 existing rights to break drug and vaccine company patent monopolies if they need to for the sake of public health. </p> <p>A hard-fought battle over Aids drugs 20 years ago led to the <strong>World Trade Organization\u2019s Doha declaration</strong> on trade-related intellectual property (Trips) in favour of access to medicines for all, but the US, which has some of the world\u2019s biggest drug companies, has strongly opposed wording that would encourage the use of Trips.</p> <p>Campaigners say the resolution expected to be passed by the world health assembly\u2019s 198 member states is along the right lines, but too weakly worded. </p> <p><strong>Jamie Love</strong> of Knowledge Ecology International said: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In a global crisis like this, that has such a massive impact on everyone, you would expect the WHO governing body to have the backbone to say no monopolies in this pandemic. </p> <p>It\u2019s one thing for a country to use its economic clout to buy preferential access to drugs or vaccines.

Some research indicates that children are far less likely to become infected compared with adults but other studies suggest that when they do become infected, they carry as much viral load as an adult, and therefore pose a real risk of passing the virus on to others.</p> <p>The situation was summed up by a senior Labour frontbencher last week: \u201cEither you put the education of children at risk by keeping schools closed, or you take a risk with their safety.

Each major government agency has an inspector general, whom watchdogs regard as playing an essential role in combatting corruption.</p> <p>The Trump administration has attempted to portray the internal government oversight apparatus as part of a conspiracy against Trump.

  "<p>It\u2019s 3 November 2020, election day. The most expensive \u2013 and nastiest \u2013 presidential race in US history is over. Turnout is light, but only because the Covid-19 pandemic has led tens of millions to abstain or vote by absentee ballot. By the time polls close on the west coast, the race remains too close to call. But shortly after midnight, the major networks announce that Joe Biden has eked out the narrowest of victories, with the former vice-president winning 271 electoral college votes to Trump\u2019s 267.</p> <p>Only something goes very wrong on 14 December 2020. That is the day on which electors across the nation meet in their respective state capitals and officially cast their votes. The balloting proceeds as anticipated \u2013 except in Pennsylvania and Illinois, two states that Biden carried. In Pennsylvania, three of the electors pledged to Biden break ranks and vote for Bernie Sanders. The same thing happens in Illinois, with three Democratic electors likewise casting their votes for Sanders. Why they have done so is not entirely clear \u2013 rumors about foreign interference fly \u2013 but the result is startling. Trump now leads in the electoral college 267 to 265.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/commentisfree/2020/may/11/midwesterners-were-already-doubting-trump-covid-could-seal-his-political-fate\">Midwesterners were already doubting Trump. Covid could seal his political fate</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In Illinois, where Democrats control the state legislature, lawmakers condemn the rogue electors and seek to replace their votes with votes for Biden. In Pennsylvania, where Republicans control the statehouse, lawmakers hail the Sanders electors as patriots and insist their colleagues in Illinois are trampling on the \u201cfaithless\u201d electors\u2019 constitutional rights.</p> <p>Who is correct? May states penalize and replace electors who fail to vote in accord with their states\u2019 popular vote outcomes, or do such actions violate the right of electors to vote free of legal control?</p> <p>That was the question debated before the supreme court this week in an extraordinary oral argument. At issue were a pair of cases emerging from the 2016 election, which witnessed no fewer than 10 electors either voting, or trying to vote, in defiance of their pledge. In Colorado, a state Hillary Clinton handily won, three Democratic electors sought to vote for the Ohio governor John Kasich as part of a long-shot effort to find a consensus alternative to Donald Trump. The Colorado secretary of state ordered the three to cast their votes as state law required or face replacement. Two of the electors complied; the third, a 23-year-old graduate student named Michael Baca, refused, and found himself replaced by a Democratic elector, who then promptly cast his vote for Clinton.</p> <p>Baca filed suit, and last August a divided federal appellate court ruled that \u201celectors, once appointed, are free to vote as they choose.\u201d Yet three months earlier, in May 2019, the Washington state supreme court reached the opposite conclusion, holding that a state may use its criminal law to enforce electoral pledges.</p> <p>Which lower court got it right?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a33947c2729b063d62729573ac2c25770a3339c7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a33947c2729b063d62729573ac2c25770a3339c7/0_0_4000_2667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People vote in the Michigan primary election at Chrysler elementary school in Detroit, Michigan, on 10 March 2020.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People vote in the Michigan primary election at Chrysler elementary school in Detroit, Michigan, on 10 March 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Kowalsky/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The court\u2019s spirited \u2013 and lengthy \u2013 argument made two things clear. First, that constitutional text, history and structure manifestly support the proposition that electors were meant to vote freely. When the framers of the constitution weighed how the nation\u2019s chief executive should be chosen, they worried that ordinary voters in a national election would prove incapable of making an informed choice about the candidates. Elbridge Gerry, who decades later as governor of Massachusetts would carve a congressional district into the shape of a salamander and so bequeath us the term \u201cgerrymander\u201d, warned of the \u201cignorance of the people\u201d, fearing they would be \u201ctoo little informed of personal characteristics in larger districts and liable of deceptions\u201d.</p> <p>So the framers settled on an electoral college, to be composed of persons of higher political standing, capable of exercising informed choice and reasoned deliberation. In Federalist No 68, Alexander Hamilton argued that entrusting the task to such men \u201caffords a moral certainty, that the office of president will never fall to the lot of any man who is not in an eminent degree endowed with the requisite qualifications\u201d.</p> <p>That, at least, was the idea. But, as this week\u2019s oral argument made clear, practice quickly eclipsed theory. It only took a couple of decades for our modern system to emerge \u2013 in which electors ceremonially vote for their state\u2019s popular vote winner. As early as 1816, Rufus King, who had been a delegate to the constitutional convention, ruefully observed that electors now functioned as \u201cmere \u2026 toys that nod when \u2026 set in motion\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A handful of rogue electors could hypothetically trigger a crisis of succession with no clear exit</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Today, most people would agree that is how electors <em>should</em> act \u2013 which is why 32 states and the District of Columbia now have laws that aim to make sure that electors do <em>not</em> vote \u201cfreely\u201d as they were originally intended. The oral argument suggests the court is not about to upset those laws. Even those justices \u2013 such as Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito \u2013 most faithful to hewing to the constitution\u2019s original meaning appeared chary about upholding the right of electors to go rogue. As Justice Brett Kavanaugh observed, the court likes to adhere to an \u201c\u2018avoid-chaos\u2019 principle of judging\u201d. And chaos could well result in a close election in which a handful of electors choose to go their own way.</p> <p>It seems safe to expect that the court \u2013 in a ruling to be issued this summer \u2013 will uphold the states\u2019 authority to constrain presidential electors. But will the court\u2019s decision save us from the scenario described above?</p> <p>Alas, no. Pennsylvania and Illinois are two of the 18 states that place no constraints on their electors whatsoever. In the absence of a law in place before electors cast their votes, it isn\u2019t clear that a state could replace a faithless elector. A handful of rogue electors could hypothetically trigger a crisis of succession with no clear exit.</p> <p>Of course, the entire problem of the rogue elector could be more elegantly solved by simply abolishing the electoral college, but that would require a constitutional amendment, and the process of amending the constitution is no less dysfunctional than the electoral college itself. So the electoral college will probably remain our constitutional appendix, a vestigial organ that has long since lost its animating function and now can only create potentially toxic problems for the body politic.</p> <ul> <li><p>Lawrence Douglas is the author, most recently, of Will He Go?

  "<h2>United States</h2> <p>Foreign policy does not usually draw much attention in US election campaigns. It was given a few token minutes in the Democratic primary debates. But that was before coronavirus.</p> <p>Anti-China sentiment is now the primary fuel of Donald Trump\u2019s re-election effort, in the absence of a workable alternative. It will be increasingly hard to run on the economy, as the president had hoped, or on the administration\u2019s pandemic response, as the human cost of the debacle becomes clear. Sinophobia has proven all the more attractive an option as it claims to explain both failures.</p> <p>\u201cUnfortunately, this is sometimes the tunnelling logic of democratic systems,\u201d Jude Blanchette, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said. \u201cEven if it comes with pretty significant national collateral damage, when it comes down to political survival the bad drives out the good.\u201d</p> <p>On Friday, Trump supporters in the <a href=\"https://www.a1apac.org/news/new-ad-toast-of-china/\">America First Action</a> committee launched a new wave of attack ads in the swing states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, framing the Democratic challenger as \u201cBeijing Biden\u201d, using selective edits of the former vice-president\u2019s past remarks and Chinese-language commentary praising the \u201cToast of China\u201d.</p> <p>The Biden camp has aired some <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JoeBiden/status/1251582266251243525?s=20\">similar ads</a> of its own, drawing on Trump\u2019s sometimes unctuous admiration for Xi Jinping, and his initially warm praise for China for its pandemic response.</p> <p>The record of the two candidates offers deep reservoirs of material. They have both been complimentary towards a powerful trading partner with an appalling human rights record \u2013 though Trump\u2019s fawning over Xi is in a different league \u2013 and both have children in business, Hunter Biden and Ivanka Trump, who have used their fathers\u2019 coat-tails to acquire preferential treatment from Beijing.</p> <p>The assumption \u2013 shared by both campaigns \u2013 that any association with China is electoral poison is supported by the figures. A <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2020/04/21/u-s-views-of-china-increasingly-negative-amid-coronavirus-outbreak/\">Pew Research poll</a> published last month found that two-thirds of Americans had a negative view of China; that distrust is likely to have deepened since then, as the Trump administration has insisted on Chinese responsibility for the pandemic.</p> <p>Against that backdrop, the campaign has become a bidding war for the most hawkish China policies, with the president instinctively heading last week straight for the extreme end of the argument.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The US-China relationship is probably the most interconnected relationship on the planet, in terms of investment and manufacturing</p> <footer> <cite>Kurt Campbell, the Asia Group</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2020/may/15/trump-we-could-cut-off-the-whole-relationship-with-china-video\">We could cut off the whole relationship</a>,\u201d Trump told Fox News, claiming \u2013 without any hint of an explanation \u2013 that such a drastic decoupling would save the US $500bn.</p> <p>As the incumbent, he will be expected to match his rhetoric with actions, so the heated battle of a bitter election is likely to have significant effects on US-China relations, which could in turn have a devastating impact on the global economy and on hopes for multilateral cooperation, while boosting the small but growing risks of conflict.</p> <p>\u201cAll the signs suggest that the administration will be willing to go quite a bit further than it already has to try to shift blame on China for the pandemic, and to pursue policies that will portray it as hard-edged on China. And the central reason for that is that the alternative is that the president accepts blame on himself for his own domestic and international governance failings,\u201d said Mira Rapp-Hooper, an expert on security in the Asia-Pacific region at the Council on Foreign Relations.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not clear to me how this ends up,\u201d Kurt Campbell, former assistant secretary of state for East Asia and Pacific affairs, said. \u201cI actually think right now that both the American and Chinese standing have been hurt on the global stage. And it feels like we\u2019re fighting while Rome burns.\u201d</p> <p>Several analysts have talked about a new \u201c<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2020/05/15/is-us-china-cold-war-already-under-way/\">cold war</a>\u201d between the world\u2019s two biggest economies, but Campbell \u2013 who now runs a business consultancy and capital management firm called the Asia Group \u2013 argued that this great power rivalry will be even messier because they have become so integrated over the past three decades.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t like the framework of the cold war, because it suggests going back to something in the past. And the peculiarities of the US-Soviet relationship were such that we had very little connection, very little understanding with one another, very little travel, very little trade,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe US-China relationship is probably the most interconnected relationship on the planet, in terms of investment and manufacturing. So to do surgery on these conjoined twins would be incredibly difficult.\u201d</p> <p>That has not stopped the Trump administration from picking up a scalpel and making a start on \u201cdecoupling\u201d.</p> <p>The \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/live/2020/jan/15/us-china-trade-deal-trump-tariffs-global-risks-uk-inflation-business-live\">phase one</a>\u201d trade deal signed in January was a vague document that did little to resolve the trade tensions between the two countries. Now, its optimistic spirit, and the idea that there might be a \u201cphase two\u201d, is a fading memory.</p> <p>The Trump administration is contemplating a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/24/donald-trump-bank-of-china-debt-report\">series of punitive measures</a> against China in retaliation for its failure to contain the pandemic.

They see China\u2019s entry into the WTO in 2001 as the original sin underlying America\u2019s industrial decline.</p> <p>Most regional experts believe that the danger of a military confrontation remains remote, but both the US and China are building up arsenals. And the heat of nationalist sentiment will make it all the harder to control any incident in regions where their armed forces converge, such as the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea.</p> <p><em>Julian Borger</em></p> <h2>China</h2> <p>This week, President Xi Jinping will preside over the delayed opening of China\u2019s annual brief session of its \u201cparliament\u201d, the National People\u2019s Congress, a gathering of high pomp, long stretches of stifling boredom, but great political significance.</p> <p>The legislature itself is just a rubber stamp, but the government uses the two weeks it is in session to unveil economic and defence targets, shuffle top officials and publish new policies.</p> <p>For decades, it had met in March, until Covid-19 upended life in China.

But as China emerged from its virus hell, a particularly ugly strain of the ideology emerged. It has found expression in many ways, from a top diplomat peddling conspiracy theories that the US brought Covid-19 to Wuhan, to racist attacks on Africans in the streets of a major city.</p> <p>In Hong Kong, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/us-and-uk-condemn-arrest-of-hong-kong-democracy-activists\">15 activists were arrested</a> in the biggest crackdown on the city\u2019s pro-democracy movement since the outbreak of mass protests last year. There have been bellicose editorials threatening Taiwan in state media.</p> <p>The malevolent triumphalism was summed up in a banner hung by one restaurant in the northern city of Shenyang. In March, diners at Mother Yang\u2019s \u2019\u2019were invited to \u201cEnthusiastically celebrate the coronavirus in America; wish the virus a long and successful journey in Japan\u201d.</p> <p>The message was quoted by Geremie Barm\u00e9, <a href=\"http://chinaheritage.net/journal/1900-2020-an-old-anxiety-in-a-new-era/\">in his translation of an essay</a> warning of an escalation in aggressively anti-western nationalism by the intellectual and former diplomat Zi Zhongyun.</p> <p>\u201cWho could have guessed that things would get exponentially worse during the coronavirus epidemic? Numerous absurd rumours have been doing the rounds, although they all feed into one overriding sentiment to \u2018bolster China and disparage the west\u2019,\u201d she wrote, comparing the current political climate with that of the Boxer rebellion, a disastrous wave of violent anti-western nationalism in 1900.</p> <p>More people have now died from the virus in the US than have been infected in China, at least going by official data.

Their fury at being stranded is a new, unexpected problem.</p> <p>But the narrative of unmatched Chinese success in disease control relies on ignoring the cover-ups and missteps that allowed the disease to spread so far, the death of the whistleblower doctor Li Wenliang and the chaos that engulfed Wuhan at the peak of its crisis. Public anger about these failings may have been silenced as the party reshapes the narrative but it has not totally vanished; and the economy was dealt a heavy blow.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>China\u2019s attacks on the US were to be expected. But it was not enough to argue that the Chinese Communist Party had succeeded, others had to be seen to fail</p> <footer> <cite>Andrew Small, research fellow</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cA lot of regime legitimacy has come from increased prosperity. After the economy started to slow down [in recent years], it became more nationalistic to help compensate for that,\u201d said Ho-Fung Hung, professor in political economy at Johns Hopkins University. \u201cNow, with coronavirus, the legitimacy problem has become more serious, so they have doubled down on aggressive nationalism.\u201d</p> <p>Across the Pacific, Xi faces an increasingly belligerent Trump. Stirring up fears of an outside threat, an enemy against which to mobilise, is a time-honoured method of building political support. Trump has an election to contest in less than six months; and, while Xi does not face such a public test, he still seeks legitimacy to bolster his government.</p> <p>\u201cChina\u2019s attacks on the US were to be expected, given the geopolitical tension between the countries,\u201d Andrew Small <a href=\"https://www.ecfr.eu/publications/summary/the_meaning_of_systemic_rivalry_europe_and_china_beyond_the_pandemic\">wrote in a recent paper for the </a><a href=\"https://www.ecfr.eu/publications/summary/the_meaning_of_systemic_rivalry_europe_and_china_beyond_the_pandemic\">European Council on Foreign Relations</a>. \u201cBut Beijing also appeared to have decided to instrumentalise Europe, at a moment of deep internal strain, in a broad information battle over the supposed inadequacies of western democracy. It was not enough to argue that the Chinese Communist Party had succeeded; others had to be seen to fail.\u201d</p> <p>Xi\u2019s triumph may not be all it seems, however, because although he has steered China out of the first stages of the coronavirus, he now has to lead the country through the economic wreckage left behind.</p> <p>And while the Chinese population can perhaps be protected from re-contagion by shutting the country\u2019s borders, its economy grew on the back of globalisation and cannot be so easily sealed off.</p> <p>Even before Covid-19 emerged, Xi was facing a cocktail of serious economic challenges, including high debt, low productivity and the fastest ageing population in the world. In the virus\u2019s wake, China has registered the slowest growth rate in more than four decades and unofficial estimates suggest that unemployment has climbed to 10% or more.</p> <p>In trying to solve these problems, China may find that its aggressive nationalism proves a costly tactic, even in a world where Trump has abdicated America\u2019s position of global leadership. \u201cChina will have a chance to displace US influence in many places, but it\u2019s a globalised world,\u201d Hung said. \u201cMy judgment is that China overreached and alienated too many people and, in the end, it will backfire on the economy when countries \u2026 try to find other places to invest or move their production facilities.\u201d</p> <p><em>Emma Graham-Harrison</em></p>",

And speaking at a fundraiser with thousands of former officials from his administration and previous campaigns, Barack Obama <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/09/us/politics/obama-flynn-coronavirus-trump.html\">issued a strong warning</a> that the move jeopardized the \u201crule of law\u201d in the country.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/08/trump-attorney-general-william-barr-flynn-case\">Welcome to William Barr's America, where the truth makes way for the president | Lloyd Green</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Barr\u2019s decision highlighted ongoing anxiety about the lasting impact the current attorney general will have on the position of attorney general and the department of justice overall.</p> <p>On Monday, more than 1,900 former and current justice department officials reiterated their call for Barr to step down for having \u201conce again assaulted the rule of law\u201d.</p> <p>The group that organized the letter collected more than 2,600 signatures for a similar letter in February after the justice department moved to reduce the sentence of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/roger-stone\">Roger Stone</a>, a former Trump administration aide who was convicted in cases that came out of special counsel <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/robert-mueller\">Robert Mueller\u2019s</a> Trump-Russia investigation. At the time, a number of prosecutors resigned in protest because of the proposed sentencing reductions.</p> <p>\u201cSpeaking as somebody who has spent 19 years at the department of justice, the way I have seen William Barr serve as attorney general seems very different to me than the way attorneys general have behaved in the past,\u201d said Barbara McQuade, a former United States attorney during the Obama administration.</p> <p>She added: \u201cTheir job is to be the attorney for the people, to be independent of the White House and instead William Barr has conducted himself in ways that make him seem more like he is a lawyer for Donald Trump.\u201d</p> <p>Trump recently said of Stone \u201clook at the horrible treatment he\u2019s got. He\u2019s going to be OK. He\u2019s going to be OK,\u201d which some federal prosecutors interpreted as a possible precursor to Barr doing more in Stone\u2019s case.</p> <p>The justice department has been a source of frustration for the president.</p> <p>Trump first appointed then-senator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeff-sessions\">Jeff Sessions</a> to the post. Sessions, a longtime US senator from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/alabama\">Alabama</a>, was the first member of his chamber to endorse Trump in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2016\">2016</a> presidential election.</p> <p>Trump often complained that Sessions was not doing enough to \u201cprotect him\u201d. Trump eventually became dissatisfied with Sessions, particularly his decision to recuse himself from Mueller\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-russia-inquiry\">Russia investigation</a>, and replaced him briefly with Matthew Whitaker, a Trump loyalist, as acting attorney general.</p> <p>Since Barr succeeded Whitaker in February 2019, legal experts have pointed out the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/18/william-barr-attorney-general-profile-trump-obstruction-of-justice\">close alignment</a> he\u2019s had with Trump. McQuade said Barr has often intervened in cases relating to Trump associates.</p> <p>\u201cNow we\u2019re seeing him interfere in cases that involve close associates of President Trump,\u201d McQuade said. \u201cCertainly as the attorney general he has the authority to do anything he wants in any case. But he doesn\u2019t. He doesn\u2019t meddle in every case, he\u2019s only involved in these cases involving Trump\u2019s associates.\u201d</p> <p>Former justice department officials and legal experts have suggested that Barr is acting more like Trump\u2019s personal attorney rather than the top law enforcement official for the federal government. And since the conclusion of Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation and even since the beginning of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus pandemic</a> Trump has repeatedly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2018/jul/05/donald-trump-firings-resignations-white-house-full-list-latest\">ousted</a> or sidelined critics within the federal government.</p> <p>McQuade wondered if Barr, with a sense of confidence from Trump, could try and go after higher-profile political figures in the future. Trump and his allies have vaguely been suggesting that Trump himself was the target of of a vague \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/12/what-is-obamagate-and-why-is-trump-so-worked-up-about-it\">Obamagate</a>\u201d scheme.</p> <p>\u201cJust looking a little further down the road, one concern is that William Barr is not done, that not only is he protecting Trump\u2019s friends, that he might use Trump\u2019s justice department not only as a shield but as a sword to go after Trump\u2019s enemies \u2013<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden\">[Joe] Biden</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/james-comey\">Jim Comey</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/barack-obama\">Obama</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hillary-clinton\">Hillary Clinton</a>,\u201d McQuade said. \u201cCould he use the justice department to go after them?\u201d</p> <p>One former federal prosecutor, who requested anonymity in order to speak more candidly, worried that Barr had \u201cset a precedent\u201d where the \u201cnext time DoJ could be used in the same political way\u201d.</p> <p>Meanwhile Elkan Abromowitz, one of the former justice department officials who signed the most recent alumni letter, said that the upcoming presidential election could strongly dictate the future role of the department.</p> <p>If Trump wins, Abromowitz said, Barr will likely keep his role. But if the former Vice President, Joe Biden, now the presumptive Democratic party nominee, wins, the attorney general and DoJ could undergo significant restructuring.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I think is going to happen is if Trump loses the election, there\u2019s probably going to be a major push to restructure the justice department out of the cabinet and make it like an independent agency like the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/federal-reserve\">Fed</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/securities-and-exchange-commission\">SEC</a> where the attorney general would be given a 10-year term, pretty much like the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/fbi\">FBI</a>,\u201d Abromowitz said.</p> <p>Abromowitz added, \u201cIf Trump wins re-election? He\u2019ll probably keep Barr around for as long as he can.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Atlanta\u2019s mayor, Keisha Lance Bottoms, comes on the line, introduced by one of her communications team, with a non-committal, \u201cHi there.

She\u2019s having a hard time keeping her kids off YouTube and TikTok, she says. \u201cThankfully, there\u2019s one week left of school. So I think I\u2019m more excited than they are.\u201d</p> <p>Like millions of other Americans, Bottoms has juggled working from home while keeping her children educated and entertained. Unlike most other Americans, Bottoms is running one of America\u2019s largest cities, Atlanta, in the middle of a pandemic \u2013 one that has disproportionately affected African Americans nationwide and in her majority-black city.</p> <p>On top of those worries, she\u2019s been involved a public disagreement with Georgia\u2019s Republican governor, Brian Kemp, after he embarked on a controversial plan to reopen the state \u2013 despite its infection rate still rising. The plan was seen as so risky even Donald Trump urged him not to do it. It also pitted a white governor against a black mayor.</p> <p>Now Atlanta\u2019s plight under Bottoms has been in the national headlines for weeks as millions of Americans monitor its trajectory of coronavirus cases and deaths. Bottoms has made the rounds on TV expressing her opposition to Kemp\u2019s proposals.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it was appropriate to begin with<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/23/georgia-businesses-wary-governor-brian-kemp-reopen\"> tattoo parlours, massage parlours, bowling alleys and barber shops</a>, and so on. I think a more thoughtful approach would have been in cases where people could socially distance,\u201d she says.</p> <p>In response to her criticism of Kemp\u2019s partial reopening, Bottoms received <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KeishaBottoms/status/1253143548809170944?s=20\">a racist text</a> calling her the N-word, which, she says, her daughter saw over her shoulder.</p> <p>She has tried bringing up concerns with Kemp, she says, requesting he require people to wear masks in places it might be impossible to socially distance, or where there might be crowds of 10 or more people in Atlanta, Georgia\u2019s capital and largest city. But he refused, she says.</p> <p>Bottoms in 2017 became the mayor of Atlanta \u2013 a city that has only had exclusively black mayors since the mid-1970s. Her victory came from predominantly black neighborhoods in the city\u2019s southern half. In the celebrated cultural capital for African Americans, she spoke about an <a href=\"https://www.atlantamagazine.com/news-culture-articles/atlanta-mayor-keisha-lance-bottoms-enormous-amount-racial-distrust/\">\u201cenormous amount of racial distrust\u201d</a>. Now, as she gains national attention for denouncing Kemp\u2019s leadership, her name has come up as a potential running mate for the presumptive Democratic nominee, Joe Biden.</p> <p>Bottoms is the daughter of the famous R&amp;B singer Major Lance, and was born and raised in Atlanta. In her YouTube video biography, she tells the story of how her grandparents came to Atlanta on a horse and buggy. Her childhood was far from idyllic, and something she has not shied away from speaking about on the campaign trail in 2017: she came home from school aged eight to her father being led away in handcuffs, later <a href=\"https://news.yahoo.com/how-atlantas-mayor-turned-her-famous-fathers-arrest-into-a-passion-for-criminal-justice-reform-190018987.html\">jailed</a> for drug dealing.</p> <p>She graduated from high school and went to university in Florida before returning home to study law. She became a prosecutor and then a judge before entering city politics representing her south-western, predominantly black corner of the city for eight years. Then she won the race to be mayor three years ago.</p> <p>Racial disharmony seems to come with the job. This weekend, after a 36-second video showed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/06/ahmaud-arbery-shooting-georgia\">a black man shot by two white men</a> as he jogged through a coastal Georgia neighbourhood, Bottoms called Ahmaud Arbery\u2019s death a<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/10/ahmaud-arbery-keisha-lance-bottoms-atlanta-mayor\"> \u201clynching\u201d</a>, catching the nation\u2019s attention as she accused Trump of inciting acts of racism.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s so fascinating to me that it reverberates in that way, because from my lens it is the assumption that everybody recognizes that it is a lynching,\u201d Bottoms says. \u201cThere\u2019s more interest in what I have to say as an African American mayor of a southern city.

Kemp beat Abrams by just under 55,000 votes amid allegations he purged tens of thousands of eligible voters from the rolls.</p> <p>\u201cYou have to give people an opportunity to govern.

  "<p>If Boris Johnson is mishandling the pandemic, he is not alone.

It may become a compulsory case study for future students of crisis management. Trump minimised the threat early on, offered phoney assurances, and failed to make a plan.

His prime minister and now his press secretary also have the virus.</p> \n<p>Of the four leaders, Johnson is the only one known to have contracted Covid-19 himself, and he emerged from his hospital stay with very different rhetoric about this virus. Putin did eventually introduce a strict lockdown, but much later than in most other European countries. Ministers or aides to all four leaders have come down with Covid-19, and macho posturing in the face of the pandemic may be part of the reason.</p> \n<p>\u201cAppearing to play it safe contradicts a core principle of masculinity: show no weakness,\u201d<em> </em><a href=\"https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/masks-and-emasculation-why-some-men-refuse-to-take-safety-precautions/\">according to</a> Peter Glick, a scientist who has co-authored research on how so-called \u201cmasculinity contest culture\u201d poisons work environments. All the leaders have built brands as strongmen offering maverick solutions, and want to be seen as recovery presidents sweeping the illness aside, even if the virus has other ideas.</p> \n<p>Of course, coronavirus does not only hit at those who foolishly defy it, and not all politicians who have contracted coronavirus are part of macho administrations. Equally, not every strongman leader has been willing to risk their health for fear of looking weak in a mask. In Hungary, prime minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n caused controversy for the opposite reason, when he was pictured visiting a hospital early in the pandemic wearing an N95 mask, while the head doctor had to make do with a simple surgical one.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>However, many leaders prone to macho posturing have been reluctant to take basic protection measures. In an extreme example, Alexander Lukashenko, perhaps Europe\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/09/thousands-turn-out-for-ve-day-parade-in-belarus-despite-covid-19-concerns\">only genuine Covid-dissident leader</a>, said, \u201cIt\u2019s better to die standing than to live on your knees\u201d when explaining why he was not introducing any restrictions to help prevent the spread.</p> \n<p>Trump and his vice-president, Mike Pence, have both refused to take what many scientists agree is the simplest precaution, and wear a mask. Even as cases of coronavirus spread inside the White House, the president has balked at the idea: \u201cI think wearing a face mask as I greet presidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens, I don\u2019t know, somehow I don\u2019t see it for myself. I just don\u2019t. Maybe I\u2019ll change my mind,\u201d he has said.</p> \n<p>His supporters seem to agree. \u201cIt\u2019s submission, it\u2019s muzzling yourself, it looks weak \u2013 especially for men,\u201d a pro-Trump protester <a href=\"https://twitter.com/brieannafrank/status/1257710908928745472\">angrily shouted</a> at mask-wearing journalists outside a Trump event recently.</p> \n<p>This has created a paradox: Putin and Trump are two of the world\u2019s best-protected leaders, cocooned by their protection officers to minimise security risks from the people they meet, the places they go to and the food that they eat. Yet both leaders refused to take simple precautions against a deadly virus.</p> \n<p>Compare all of this to the European nation with the lowest death toll per capita \u2013 Slovakia. There, a new government coalition was sworn in in March, all in masks, president Zuzana \u010caputov\u00e1 has made all public appearances in a mask, and even television presenters have read the news in masks, to drill the message home to the population that there should be nothing embarrassing or emasculating about wearing one. The country is now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/czechs-grapple-with-how-to-ease-covid-19-lockdown?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other\">coming out of lockdown</a>, having suffered just 27 deaths from the virus.</p> \n<p>Bolsonaro, and to some extent Trump, appear to be driven by a populist mistrust of science, while other leaders may feel constricted by the political brands they have built themselves. There may also be a more natural human impulse at work: understanding the risks but nevertheless feeling above them.</p> \n<p>\u201cPeople are built in a way that although you know that you should be ready for it, you still think that you personally will be able to escape,\u201d Peskov said in a newspaper interview from his hospital bed this week.</p>",
  "<p>Britain is on course for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/14/uk-budget-deficit-to-rise-to-300bn-this-year-obr-says\" title=\"\">a \u00a3300bn increase in government debt</a> this year as the bills for keeping much of the economy mothballed during the coronavirus outbreak continue to mount.</p> <p>Money to support businesses that have closed down make up the lion\u2019s share, and the rest can be accounted for by increased welfare costs and the loss of billions of pounds to the exchequer in taxes that will never be paid.</p> <p>The total debt pile, which has already hit 83% of GDP, or more than \u00a32 trillion, will probably reach around 115% of national income (GDP) by next year.</p> <p>In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis this level of debt was associated with profligate governments that had spent well beyond their means on white elephant infrastructure projects and wasteful subsidies. These were government debt levels to be avoided rather than emulated. Italy saw its debts increase beyond 130% of GDP, and Greece suffered a sudden increase in sovereign debts to 183% of GDP.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Even the architects of austerity agree almost-zero borrowing costs and low inflation give the Treasury an opportunity</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Now, the panic is much closer to home. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/13/treasury-tax-hikes-pay-freezes-covid-19-costs-budget-deficit-spending\" title=\"\">A Treasury memo</a> leaked last week showed that there is concern in some quarters at the escalating costs of fighting the coronavirus.</p> <p>The alarm raised by the document\u2019s anonymous authors was that, far from being a one-off financial hit, the coronavirus pandemic will cause the economy lasting harm and the debts built up during the crisis will, at least to some extent, recur in subsequent years.</p> <p>Taking this argument a step further, the authors reverted to a Treasury mindset \u2013 one dating back hundreds of years that stresses the need for prudence and repeats the calls that followed 2008 for spending cuts and tax rises to begin the process of balancing the books.</p> <p>The memo argued that a public sector wage freeze could save about \u00a36.5bn by 2023-24. The Conservative government\u2019s \u201ctriple tax lock\u201d promise not to raise income tax, national insurance or VAT, made before the election, would need to be ditched, along with its promise to protect the state pension.</p> <p>There is another option though, one that George Osborne considered far too risky 10 years ago. That it is to live with a high level of government debt and focus on expanding the economy.</p> <p>Thankfully, we have a chancellor who has suggested he would prefer enlarging the economy as the primary means of cutting the deficit.</p> <p>Without hesitation, Sunak publicly rejected a return to austerity, telling parliament that the government\u2019s \u201clevelling-up\u201d agenda would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/live/2020/apr/14/coronavirus-uk-live-news-lockdown-extended-peak-dominic-raab-boris-johnson-latest-updates\" title=\"\">take priority</a>. \u201cIndeed I believe this can still be a critical part of how we get back to normal,\u201d he said.</p> <p>This will not be an easy task. In the short term, the government has to find a way to restart the economy without sparking a return of the disease. Then it must begin the task of identifying how public investment can support the industries that can accelerate quickly out of the crisis, and not just those that are in need of rescuing.</p> <p>There will be many challenges, not least from a health and social care crisis that is likely to persist, even as both sectors attempt to get back to normal.</p> <p>A levelling-up agenda that favours the regions and nations of the UK beyond London and south-east will take time, and will also need to focus on green growth so that the cuts in carbon emissions seen over the past few months are not thrown away.</p> <p>One advantage the chancellor has over his predecessors is a consensus among economists of all persuasions that this time is different and the level of debt he finds himself with next year will be irrelevant.</p> <p>Even the architects of post-2008 austerity agree that almost-zero borrowing costs and low inflation give the Treasury an opportunity to use the instruments of the state to drive growth while large parts of the private sector are fighting to recover. In the battle against coronavirus and its consequences, austerity must be off the table.</p> <h2>Kenya\u2019s Amina Mohamed could be the leader the WTO needs</h2> <p>The World Trade Organization ranks alongside the International Monetary Fund, the United Nations and the World Bank as one of the pillars of the global multilateral system. Running it is one of the international community\u2019s plum jobs. And among its toughest.</p> <p>That job is now vacant because Roberto Azev\u00eado is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/roberto-azevedo-quits-as-wto-world-trade-organization-chief-a-year-early\" title=\"\">stepping down early</a> as director general \u2013 and few will blame him. Trying to achieve consensus among the WTO\u2019s 164 members is a thankless task and even at the best of times as difficult as herding cats. These are not the best of times. The weapon of choice in the new cold war between the US and China is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/sep/01/us-and-china-begin-imposing-new-tariffs-as-trade-war-escalates\" title=\"\">the tariff</a>. Protectionist pressures abound. Donald Trump has neutered the WTO by refusing to allow the appointment of new judges to its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/11/uk-post-brexit-trade-at-risk-as-wto-top-court-shuts-down\" title=\"\">appeals body</a>.</p> <p>The person lucky \u2013 or unlucky \u2013 enough to get the job will need a thick skin, the highest diplomatic skills and a personality that commands respect. What\u2019s more, the successful candidate has to be from a limited group of countries.</p> <p>There is no chance of Trump agreeing to the appointment of a Chinese candidate, nor would president Xi Jinping allow an American to get the gig. Neither Washington nor Beijing would agree to either of the two Europeans whose names are being mentioned: Spanish foreign minister Arancha Gonz\u00e1lez Laya or former EU trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m. A Latin American is ruled out because Azev\u00eado is Brazilian.</p> <p>The view in Geneva is that it is time a woman ran the WTO, and the one to watch is Amina Mohamed, currently Kenya\u2019s sports minister, but formerly the country\u2019s much-respected ambassador to the WTO. If the rest of the continent gets behind her she has a chance of becoming the first African to run the WTO. She would be a good choice.</p> <h2>Dark theatres herald dark days for TV, as talent pipeline dries up</h2> <p>If Netflix and its peers are winners in the coronavirus disaster, it will not compensate for the wider disaster culture in general will suffer. Figures published last week showed that, since the lockdown, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/may/15/streaming-services-uk-netflix-amazon-prime-video-disney-subscribers-coronavirus\" title=\"\">4.6 million British households</a> have signed up to streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime Video or Disney+.</p> <p>At the same time, one of the UK\u2019s most prestigious theatres, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/may/13/old-vic-theatre-perilous-matthew-warchus\" title=\"\">Old Vic, warned last week that it was in a \u201cseriously perilous\u201d financial situation</a> owing to the pandemic.</p> <p>Netflix and the Old Vic are not competitors. If a household puts \u00a38.99 a month into the world\u2019s most popular streaming service, that money has not been taken out of the theatre world\u2019s pocket.</p> <p>However, the cultural ecosystem that Netflix, Amazon and Disney all rely upon will be diminished if the Old Vic and countless other theatres are to disappear.</p> <p>In 2018 the Old Vic staged the world premiere of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/may/03/mood-music-review-joe-penhall-songwriting-pop-industry\" title=\"\">Joe Penhall\u2019s play <em>Mood Music</em></a>. Penhall, a highly successful British playwright, recently wrote <em>Mindhunter</em> for Netflix. In 2019 the Old Vic staged <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/oct/20/lungs-review-old-vic-london-claire-foy-and-matt-smith-shine-in-climate-crisis-drama\" title=\"\"><em>Lungs</em>, starring Claire Foy and Matt Smith</a> from <em>The Crown</em>, a major Netflix hit. In the food chain of talent and ideas, the stage plays a crucial role in nurturing writing, acting, directing and technical talent.</p> <p>Just as broadcasters and cinemas are realising that a global production shutdown is going to mean empty schedules in the near future, an existential disaster for theatre will, ultimately, deal a blow to the originality and excellence that is a major part of the appeal of streaming services, as well as the supply of talent into the worlds of TV and film.</p> <p>So the Old Vic last week became another thread pulled by the disease, which could unravel all the way to the apogee of modern broadcasting.</p> <p>Cultural loss can be difficult to quantify \u2013 the album that was never recorded, the online magazine that was never launched, the exhibition that never opened \u2013 but the threat to one of the arts\u2019 cornerstones is real: and it is immeasurable.</p>",
  "<p>From her perch as speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi has bested Donald Trump in budget battles, mocked him at the State of the Union and won an outsized place in his brain. Now Molly Ball of Time magazine delivers a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/05/books/review/pelosi-by-molly-ball-an-excerpt.html\">biography</a> that does justice to the most powerful woman in American history: well-researched, a smooth read that goes back to the beginning.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/10/for-god-and-country-review-christian-case-trump-ralph-reed\">For God and Country review: Christian case for Trump is a thin read indeed</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Ball traces Pelosi\u2019s rise from a childhood in Baltimore, the daughter of Thomas D\u2019Alesandro Jr, a Democratic mayor and former congressman. Pelosi\u2019s politics were shaped by the New Deal, the Depression, the Catholic church and the city\u2019s cacophonous tapestry. Think ethnic reductionism leavened by transactionalism. Good government was not an end in itself.</p> <p>The young Pelosi was privy to the needs of her father\u2019s constituents but also to the frustrations of Annunciata Lombardi D\u2019Alesandro, her immigrant mother. As Ball makes clear, her ambition was thwarted for the sake of family and her husband.</p> <p>\u201cBig Tommy\u2019s\u201d career came to a halt after a criminal investigation, an unsuccessful bid for the US Senate and a failed comeback at city hall. When their mother died, Pelosi\u2019s brother Tommy, like their father a former Baltimore mayor, called their mother the \u201creally true politician of the family\u201d.</p> <p>While politics was part of Pelosi\u2019s upbringing, her own entrance came later. Soon after college she married Paul Pelosi, an aspiring banker. Unlike other rich legislators such as <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/14/dianne-feinstein-husband-stock-trades-258693\">Dianne Feinstein</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/06/us/politics/kelly-loeffler-compensation.html\">Kelly Loeffller</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/16/opinion/elaine-chao-mitch-mcconnell.html\">Mitch McConnell</a>, Pelosi\u2019s money is seldom a source of headlines.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Pelosi is an unabashed liberal. But she is also an institutionalist</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The pair moved to New York and then to San Francisco. By the time Pelosi turned 30, in 1970, she was the mother of five children. The speaker\u2019s gavel was not on the horizon. But within a decade, life would change.</p> <p>As a young mother with a penchant for books, San Francisco\u2019s libraries were a natural destination. In Ball\u2019s telling, one day Joseph Alioto, the mayor, called Pelosi and asked if she was \u201c\u2018making a big pot of pasta e fagioli?\u2019\u201d An obnoxious question, in Ball\u2019s view, but dinner was not Alioto\u2019s point. He wanted to appoint Pelosi to the public library commission.</p> <p>After Pelosi said she enjoyed volunteering, Alioto pushed back. His take was simple: if \u201cyou\u2019re doing the work \u2026 you should get official recognition for it\u201d. Later, Pelosi came to view the call as a feminist-minded assist from an unexpected source.</p> <p>Pelosi emerged as a bridge between rival Democratic factions. She also offered a roadmap to California governor Jerry Brown\u2019s run for president in 1976. When Brown won the Maryland primary he thanked Pelosi as the \u201carchitect\u201d of his campaign. At that point, Pelosi \u201cwas more than a housewife, more than a pocketbook, more than a hostess\u201d, in Ball\u2019s words. \u201cShe was a strategist.\u201d</p> <p>In 1981, Pelosi became chair of the California Democratic party and embarked on a voter registration drive that added 700,000 to the electoral rolls. She successfully pushed for San Francisco as the site of the 1984 Democratic convention, and along the way had a brush with Feinstein, then mayor of the City by Bay. She thought the cost excessive.</p> <p>Following the death of Representative Sala Burton, the wife of legendary congressman Phil Burton, Pelosi was elected to the US House in 1987. There, she \u201cgravitated toward the \u2018hard\u2019 committees\u201d like appropriations and intelligence, the \u201cones that did work traditionally seen as masculine: dollars and cents, war and peace\u201d. Early on, Pelosi understood where actual power and influence resided.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When it came to impeachment Pelosi moved slowly, and discounted the trigger-happy voices of AOC and the 'Squad'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As a congresswoman, Pelosi did her homework. She raised money, collected chits and made friends in unexpected places. The late John Murtha, a gruff congressman and ex-marine from Pennsylvania\u2019s God and guns country, became an ally. The two had sat on the appropriations committee, which Murtha chaired.</p> <p>When George W Bush\u2019s \u201cmission accomplished\u201d moment degenerated into a mordant fiasco, Murtha became Pelosi\u2019s point person in attacking the Iraq war. To her credit, Pelosi was mindful of the potency of culture in politics, that her home district was not a mirror image of the US. Murtha was a more effective attack dog than the left\u2019s usual suspects.</p> <p>Pelosi is an unabashed liberal. But she is also an institutionalist, the ranking Democrat on the House intelligence committee until she was elected minority leader in 2006. These days, Adam Schiff, another Californian by choice, chairs the committee.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fad75cdeec984ff1be2ab48d3bf1f34b1b09654a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fad75cdeec984ff1be2ab48d3bf1f34b1b09654a/0_0_3649_2712/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pelosi rips up Donald Trump\u2019s State of the Union address, in February this year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"743\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pelosi rips up Donald Trump\u2019s State of the Union address, in February this year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Wilson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When it came to impeachment Pelosi moved slowly, and discounted the trigger-happy voices of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the \u201cSquad\u201d.

Swing-district America weighed on Pelosi\u2019s calculus.</p> <p>There are sentiments and then there is unvarnished math. Pelosi is by far a more adroit vote-counter than Paul Ryan or John Boehner, the past two Republican speakers. She is better at it than her own whip team, as Kevin McCarthy, the House minority leader, can attest.</p> <p>Pelosi\u2019s weaknesses are delivering a set speech and the Sunday morning talkshows. That doesn\u2019t seem so serious next to Newt Gingrich, the speaker who led the impeachment charge against Bill Clinton and resigned in disgrace. For that matter <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/18/us/dennis-hastert-released.html\">Denny Hastert</a>, Gingrich\u2019s successor, eventually went to prison for covering-up hush money payments to former students he had sexually abused.</p> <p>Pelosi is the one politician to repeatedly humble Trump in front of national audiences. She exudes competence, avoids scandal and has earned the gratitude and loyalty of her caucus. Her rise and return to the speakership were anything but inevitable. That\u2019s what makes her story worth telling, and Ball is definitely up to the task.</p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s histrionic threat last week to \u201ccut off the whole relationship\u201d with China produced a scornful response from Beijing. \u201cSuch lunacy is a clear byproduct of the anxiety the US has suffered since China began its global ascent,\u201d the <em>Global Times</em>, the Chinese government\u2019s mouthpiece, <a href=\"http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1188451.shtml\">commented</a>. The \u201cWashington elites\u201d were in a panic over the pandemic, it claimed.</p> <p>While the tone was unfortunate, neither assertion wholly lacked truth. The US and its western allies do have concerns \u2013 some legitimate, some exaggerated \u2013 about China\u2019s rise to superpower status. And the mishandling of the Covid-19 crisis by Trump, who appears increasingly unbalanced, makes China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, look undeservedly competent by comparison.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s threat, as foolish as it is impractical, typified the irrational behaviour of the US leader. <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/05/14/china-us-pandemic-economy-tensions-trump-coronavirus-covid-new-cold-war-economics-the-great-decoupling/\">His target was no surprise</a>. Trump and his \u201cAmerica first\u201d acolytes have long contended that China is ripping off America by indulging in unfair trade practices, stealing its commercial secrets and destroying manufacturing jobs.</p> <p>In current jargon, they want to \u201cdecouple\u201d, and this process \u2013 the Chinese call it \u201csuppression\u201d \u2013 is now accelerating. Higher tariffs on Chinese imports, and controls on hi-tech US exports and Chinese inward investment, were extended last week to include <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/ajimpact/trump-admin-tightens-screws-huawei-chip-sale-rule-200515160938651.html\">new measures </a>targeting the telecoms giant, Huawei. A compromise trade deal agreed earlier this year is in jeopardy.</p> <p>Fear and hostility towards outsiders, economic grievance and entitlement, and a powerful sense of American exceptionalism \u2013 all sentiments feeding the confrontation with China \u2013 are the building blocks of the rightwing nationalist, populist, quasi-racist coalition that Trump assembled in 2016. Beating this coalition of hate is 2020\u2019s election challenge.</p> <p>Given this context, it was entirely predictable Trump would try to distract attention from his coronavirus fiasco by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/04/five-eyes-network-contradicts-theory-covid-19-leaked-from-lab\">accusing Beijing </a>of exacerbating the crisis. With the polarised, amoral state of domestic politics, it was predictable, too, that he would exploit this tragedy to attack his Democratic rival, Joe Biden.</p> <p>All that said, many actions taken by China\u2019s Communist party leadership, both during the Covid-19 crisis and before in relation to western democracies, are also a cause for genuine concern. Xi was unarguably late in alerting the world to the seriousness of the Wuhan outbreak. By initially trying to cover it up, and delaying WHO investigatory efforts, he did the world a great disservice.</p> <p>China\u2019s subsequent behaviour in trying to parlay this disaster into a soft-power triumph, using bad-mannered diplomats to assail its critics, harshly repressing internal dissent, and rejecting an independent, international inquiry into the causes and handling of the pandemic is unacceptable. It strengthens the hand of its detractors and <a href=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/how-not-to-win-friends-and-influence-people-in-europe\">dismays its friends</a>.</p> <p>The Beijing government is also wrong to play, in effect, Trump\u2019s game by allowing global viral trauma to fuel a wider strategic, economic and potentially military confrontation \u2013 what some experts are calling a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/04/using-the-virus-to-bash-beijing-could-trigger-a-new-cold-war\">new cold war</a>. Ominous parallels with the fatal deterioration in relations between Japan and the US during the 1930s Depression era are starting to emerge.</p> <p>At this moment of extreme stress, it is vital to keep matters in perspective. No, China has not become a liberal democracy, as some in the west hoped. Yes, human right abuses in Xinjiang, Tibet and Hong Kong are egregious. And yes, China\u2019s cyber-snooping and bullying of neighbours in the South China Sea and Taiwan is wrong and should cease.</p> <p>Yet overall, China\u2019s opening to the world in the post-Tiananmen age has been beneficial all round. Maoism was set aside, millions were pulled out of poverty, and China, by and large, has come to support a prosperous, stable global order where disputes are settled peacefully. China is not the Soviet Union. It is a rival. It is a challenger. It sometimes plays dirty. But it is not an enemy \u2013 unless malefactors like Trump are allowed to make it so.</p>",

But city officials pointed to the need to respect social distancing rules and allowed a demonstration of up to 1,000 people.</p> \n  <p>The hard core of protesters is being led by several new groups. One group is Resistance 2020, led by a lawyer from eastern Leipzig and a doctor from south-west Germany who question official corona statistics and view the main political parties as constructs of an elitist rule.</p> \n  <p>Another group called Compact describes itself as the \u201csharp sword against imperial propaganda\u201d.

Dr. Nelson Teich quit a day after President Jair Bolsonaro stepped up pressure on him to expand use of the antimalarial drug chloroquine in treating patients.</p> \n  <p>Meanwhile the director of the US Centers for Disease Control says deaths in the US are projected to exceed 100,000 by 1 June \u2013 just over two weeks\u2019 time. The US toll currently stands at 87,427. </p> \n  <p>Here are the main developments from the last few hours: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Confirmed cases worldwide top 4.5m. </strong>According to the <a href=\"https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6\">Johns Hopkins University tracker</a>, there are 4,531,811 confirmed cases worldwide. The number of people who have lost their lives is 307,001 according to official tolls, but the true number is likely to be much higher.</li> \n   <li><strong>The number of deaths in the US</strong><strong> is projected to exceed 100,000 by 1 June,</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CDCDirector/status/1261406011039993856\">according to the CDC director Robert Redfield</a>. The agency came to the conclusion after tracking 12 different forecasting models; all of which predicted at least that number of deaths. Trump has oscillated, but has previously said the toll would be lower.</li> \n   <li><strong>Record increase in cases in Brazil. </strong>Brazil has confirmed 15,305 new cases; a record for a 24-hour period, as well as 824 related deaths, according to data from the country\u2019s Health Ministry. Brazil has registered 218,223 confirmed cases since the start of the pandemic, as well as 14,817 deaths.</li> \n   <li><strong>Beijing increases pressure on European states to reject Taiwan\u2019s WHO inclusion. </strong>China has stepped up the pressure on European states to reject Taiwan\u2019s call to be represented at next week\u2019s assembly of the World Health Organization, arguing that its presence can only be justified if it accepts that it is part of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/china\">China</a>.The <a href=\"https://www.who.int/about/governance/world-health-assembly\">World Health Assembly </a>is being held virtually on Monday, and Taiwan\u2019s attendance \u2013 as well as a possible international inquiry into the start of the pandemic \u2013 are likely to be the two big political flashpoints between China and the west.</li> \n   <li><strong>US president Donald Trump said on Friday the US government was working with other countries to develop a coronavirus vaccine at an accelerated pace</strong>. Trump expressed his hope that a vaccine would be in place before the end of the year at an event in the White House Rose Garden and said his administration would mobilise its forces to get a vaccine distributed once one was in place.</li> \n   <li><strong>UK\u2019s reproduction rate still close to 1, bringing lockdown-easing steps into question. </strong>The latest official estimate places the national R value - the rate at which people are passing on infections to others \u2013 at between 0.7 and 1. An R value above 1 means the epidemic will start to grow exponentially again, which would result in a new surge of cases.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>Europe could face deadly second wave of winter infections, WHO warns. </strong>Dr Hans Kluge, director for the WHO European region, warned countries beginning to ease their lockdown restrictions that now is \u201ctime for preparation, not celebration\u201d.</li> \n   <li><strong>Second health minister resigns in Brazil after less than a month on the job. </strong>Brazil\u2019s health minister, Nelson Teich, handed in his resignation on Friday, his office said, after less than a month on the job as the country becomes a world hotspot for coronavirus. Teich is believed to have disagreed with the rightwing president, Jair Bolsonaro. Brazil has now surpassed Germany and France and had more than 200,000 confirmed cases of the virus as of Thursday.</li> \n   <li><strong>Spain hails large-scale antibody study as a key tool in the fight against the coronavirus. </strong>The Spanish government has hailed a large-scale antibody study as a key tool in the fight against the coronavirus, but warned that any premature or irresponsible relaxation of restrictions could have \u201cenormous consequences\u201d given that only 5% of Spaniards have had the disease.</li> \n   <li><strong>Denmark reports zero coronavirus-related deaths for the first time since March. </strong>The country reported zero coronavirus-related deaths in the last 24 hours for the first time since 13 March</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n</div>"
