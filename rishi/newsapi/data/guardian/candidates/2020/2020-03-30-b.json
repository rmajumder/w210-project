As two surgeons became the first doctors to die from the disease in Britain, staff lobby groups attacked continuing shortages of gear such as masks and gowns and there were further calls for increased testing of workers.

magnets stuck up nose while inventing coronavirus device</h2> \n  <p>An Australian astrophysicist has been admitted to hospital after getting four magnets stuck up his nose in an attempt to invent a device that stops people touching their faces during the coronavirus outbreak.<br></p> \n  <p>Dr Daniel Reardon, a research fellow at Melbourne\u2019s Swinburne University, was building a necklace that sounds an alarm on facial contact, when the mishap occurred on Thursday night.</p> \n  <p>The 27 year-old astrophysicist, who studies pulsars and gravitational waves, said he was trying to liven up the boredom of self-isolation with the four powerful neodymium magnets.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI have some electronic equipment but really no experience or expertise in building circuits or things,\u201d he told Guardian Australia.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI had a part that detects magnetic fields. I thought that if I built a circuit that could detect the magnetic field, and we wore magnets on our wrists, then it could set off an alarm if you brought it too close to your face. A bit of boredom in isolation made me think of that.\u201d</p> \n  <p>However, the academic realised the electronic part he had did the opposite \u2013 and would only complete a circuit when there was no magnetic field present.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI accidentally invented a necklace that buzzes continuously unless you move your hand close to your face,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cAfter scrapping that idea, I was still a bit bored, playing with the magnets. It\u2019s the same logic as clipping pegs to your ears \u2013 I clipped them to my earlobes and then clipped them to my nostril and things went downhill pretty quickly when I clipped the magnets to my other nostril.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Reardon said he placed two magnets inside his nostrils, and two on the outside. When he removed the magnets from the outside of his nose, the two inside stuck together. Unfortunately, the researcher then attempted to use his remaining magnets to remove them.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/30/astrophysicist-gets-magnets-stuck-up-nose-while-inventing-coronavirus-device\">Astrophysicist gets magnets stuck up nose while inventing coronavirus device</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8166818f08af215f6fdc69\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/helen-davidson\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-30T05:15:18.033Z\">6.15am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Senior WHO adviser appears to dodge question on Taiwan\u2019s Covid-19 response</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A senior advisor at the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/world-health-organization\">World Health Organization</a> (WHO) appeared to hang up on a journalist who asked about Taiwan\u2019s response to the coronavirus pandemic, and then did not answer further questions because they had \u201calready talked about China\u201d.</p> \n  <p>It comes amid continued criticism of the WHO\u2019s approach towards both Taiwan and China.

It is shocking that Trump is essentially admitting that when the American people vote, Republican lose,\u201d said Xochitl Hinojosa, a DNC spokeswoman. \u201cTrump knows that suppressing the vote is the only way he and Republicans win in November.\u201d</p> <p>Shortly after he was elected, Trump falsely claimed he would have won the popular vote had it not been for millions of illegal votes. There is no credible evidence to support the claim. In December, a Trump campaign aide was recorded saying: \u201cTraditionally it\u2019s always been Republicans suppressing votes in places.\u201d The aide later told the Associated Press he was saying that Republicans have traditionally been <a href=\"https://apnews.com/af2f0ede054d8baebbe1bb6ca47b4895\">accused of voter suppression</a>.</p> <p>The $400m that Congress allocated so far is just a small fraction of what the Brennan Center for Justice <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/estimated-costs-covid-19-election-resiliency-measures\">estimated</a> election officials need to run elections in November if coronavirus still lingers. Officials need that money to pay for postage, personnel and equipment to process an influx of mail-in ballots.</p> <p>The urgency of getting election officials those resources should not be lost in the political fighting, said Myrna Perez, director of the Brennan Center\u2019s voting rights and elections program.</p> <p>\u201cWhat cannot be lost in all the back and forth among politicians is that election administrators at the state and local level need substantial resources now to ensure that the elections in November go off smoothly and safely,\u201d she said.</p>",

  "<p>When Spelman College announced this month it was suspending in-person classes and closing residence halls in response to coronavirus, Ashee Groce, a junior, had a question: how would she vote?</p> <p>Groce, who serves as president of Young Democrats of America at Spelman, had registered herself and a number of fellow students in the Atlanta area. But they had now lost their housing and would have to return home before Georgia\u2019s presidential primary.</p> <p>On a press call for the not-for-profit Rock the Vote, Groce said she was grateful Georgia was one of the states that have delayed their primaries, giving her more time to figure out how to cast a ballot, but those decisions have sparked their own set of concerns.</p> <p>As the coronavirus outbreak spreads across America, it is wreaking havoc in an election year as Democrats pick a champion to try to oust Donald Trump from the White House.</p> <p>But at least 15 Democratic primaries have now been delayed because of coronavirus, essentially freezing the Democratic nominating contest \u2013 currently dominated by the former vice-president Joe Biden. While state officials scramble to find safe ways for voters to cast their ballots, voting rights advocates warn that lawmakers will have to do considerable work to ensure the pandemic does not derail the presidential election.</p> <p>The delayed primaries are admittedly unlikely to change the final outcome of the Democratic race, considering Biden\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/17/2020-four-states-primaries-coronavirus-election\">significant delegate lead</a> over his rival, the democratic socialist senator Bernie Sanders. But the country\u2019s necessary focus on coronavirus has left Biden mostly on the sidelines as he tries to pivot to his likely match-up against Donald Trump in November. The status of the party\u2019s summer nominating convention also appears to be <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/us/politics/democratic-convention-milwaukee-coronavirus.html\">up in the air</a>, which could rob Biden of another key opportunity to make his pitch to voters to choose him over Trump.</p> <p>Asked last week whether the convention should be canceled, Biden said no. \u201cI don\u2019t think it should be called off, and I don\u2019t think we should call off any of the elections,\u201d the candidate told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper. \u201cI think we just have to move forward. We may have to use different means and methods. There\u2019s an awful lot of direct mail voting going on right now, which may be one of the answers.\u201d</p> <p>The Democratic National Committee chairman, Tom Perez, sent a similar message this month after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/16/judge-declines-ohio-request-delay-primary-vote-amid-coronavirus\">Ohio canceled </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/16/judge-declines-ohio-request-delay-primary-vote-amid-coronavirus\">in-person voting</a> at the last minute over concerns about spreading coronavirus at polling places. Perez said in a statement that states should focus on expanding no-excuse absentee voting and vote by mail \u201cinstead of moving primaries to later in the cycle, when timing around the virus remains unpredictable\u201d.</p> <p>Democrats, who have long pushed for more absentee voter options, said the 17 March primaries in Florida, Illinois and Arizona demonstrated the need to expand such efforts in the face of coronavirus. Illinois, which relies mostly on in-person voting, saw a 25% decrease in turnout that was largely attributed to voters\u2019 concerns about the spread of coronavirus. But Florida and Arizona, which both have robust early voting and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/17/coronavirus-vote-by-mail-restrictions-us\">vote by mail</a> operations, actually saw increases in overall turnout.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b813dfa4ddb3b8b947c9a893984de0222387f2ff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b813dfa4ddb3b8b947c9a893984de0222387f2ff/0_293_3300_1980/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People leave a voting station during the Florida primary on 17 March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People leave a voting station during the Florida primary on 17 March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Larry Marano/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sean Eldridge, the founder of the progressive group Stand Up America, said postponing primaries was unavoidable because so many states lack appropriate voting protocols to deal with such crises. \u201cI think every state is going to have to make that choice right now, but the problem is too many states are not prepared for this moment,\u201d Eldridge said.</p> <p>Eldridge\u2019s group drove more than 70,000 constituent calls to lawmakers urging them to include funding to expand no-excuse absentee voting and vote by mail in the $2tn coronavirus package.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/26/coronavirus-donald-trump-triumph-or-disaster\">Will the coronavirus crisis spell triumph or disaster for Donald Trump?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cNone of us know how long this pandemic is going to last, and we need to make sure every single eligible voter is able to cast their ballot,\u201d Eldridge said. \u201cIf Congress provides sufficient funding to the states, then states can put that infrastructure in place now to address the coronavirus pandemic but also to be prepared for future events that could disrupt future elections.\u201d</p> <p>But experts emphasize that states will need to develop a safe in-person voting option to ensure fair elections in the months to come.</p> <p>Certain people, such as those who are homeless or living on a Native American reservation, may not have reliable access to mail, so an entirely mail-based election could leave them behind.</p> <p>\u201cThere are these communities that get already wronged by our system, and they\u2019re already getting underresourced,\u201d said Myrna Perez, the director of the voting rights and elections program at the Brennan Center for Justice. \u201cRelying on the mail in that way would just bake in those existing inequalities.\u201d</p> <p>Perez urged states to set rigorous sanitization standards for polling sites and ensure voters can practice social distancing while casting in-person ballots, so Americans can protect their health while voting.</p> <p>\u201cWe need many, many different options ready to go because we\u2019re going to have many diverse communities that need to get served, and there\u2019s not going to be one way that is able to serve them all,\u201d Perez said.</p> <p>The Brennan Center <a href=\"o%09https:/www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/estimated-costs-covid-19-election-resiliency-measures\">has estimated</a> it will cost up to $2bn to ensure the fairness of elections during the pandemic, but the coronavirus stimulus bill allocates only $400mn for election assistance. Voting rights advocates and Democratic lawmakers described the funding as an encouraging sign, especially considering Senate Republicans allocated $140m for election assistance in their initial proposal, but they say they are not done fighting for a more robust response.</p> <p>\u201cWe all know that this pandemic has been a threat to our economy, to our health and to our democracy,\u201d Eldridge said. \u201cIt\u2019s important that Congress respond on all three of those fronts.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>In 2004, when Philip Roth published his speculative fiction novel The Plot Against America, the perfect title had already been taken. Sinclair Lewis laid claim to It Can\u2019t Happen Here back in 1935 with a novel that imagined a populist demagogue whipping the United States into a fascist dystopia, complete with internment camps for dissidents and paramilitary goon squads. That unholy phrase \u2013 \u201cit can\u2019t happen here,\u201d incredulity and naivety and hubris all wrapped up in one futile reassurance \u2013 gets uttered in Ed Burns and David Simon\u2019s new TV adaptation of Roth\u2019s novel, a high-gloss prestige miniseries airing Sunday nights on HBO. It sounds out like a death knell for all those who speak it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/26/unorthodox-behind-the-deutschland-83-co-creators-new-netflix-series\">Unorthodox: behind the Deutschland 83 co-creator's new Netflix series</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The show picks up in June 1940, diverging from the historical record with the political ascendency and presidential election of aviator/war hero Charles Lindbergh that fall. His strict anti-interventionist stance toward the spread of Nazism through Europe and the thinly veiled xenophobia implied therein germinate over the following years in a chilling illustration of how fascism flourishes. The shifting national currents articulate themselves in the rapidly changing lives of the Levin family, Jews living in a Newark enclave. Father Herman (Morgan Spector, exuding an era-appropriate Old Hollywood leading-man energy in face and poise) is the one to invoke the famous last words mentioned above, the last gasp from freedom before it\u2019s extinguished.</p> <p>But in typically Burns-Simonian fashion, \u201cit can\u2019t happen here\u201d doesn\u2019t arrive at a climactic, or even decisive moment. It\u2019s said on the streets, at the dinner table, in bars. The Burns-Simon approach pieces together understated, quotidian scenes to create large-scale portraits of sea change. In this respect, The Plot Against America confronts its viewers with the most peculiar and crucial quality of a dictator\u2019s rise, which is that it\u2019s all so banal until it suddenly, horrifyingly, isn\u2019t.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwMwrft7So8\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RwMwrft7So8?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>At every step of Lindberghism\u2019s nefarious creep into the country\u2019s culture, the antisemitic rhetoric gets filtered and sanitized through rationalization and doubletalk. The man himself works the talking point that he\u2019s not about condoning genocide against the Jews, but that he innocently wants to keep America out of war. His followers do the rest of the work for him; they insist that he only accepted a commendation medal from the Nazis as a foreign dignitary, that he\u2019s friends with plenty of Jews, that he\u2019s got a good heart, that the things he says can\u2019t be taken at face value. The Trump parallels come early and often, and while the writing occasionally prints its subtext in font a couple of sizes too large, it\u2019s all in order to make the point that much more forcefully.</p> <p>The series\u2019 key character may be John Turturro\u2019s southern rabbi Lionel Bengelsdorf, an early supporter of Lindbergh\u2019s who rises to one of the highest stations in his party\u2019s administration. He\u2019s responsible for laundering the antisemitic image of Lindbergh\u2019s campaign through his own identity and perspective, assuring his fellow Jews that the man\u2019s got nothing personal against the tribe, and that his political stances are just that. If the show follows its source material, he\u2019ll end up on the chopping block once the bigotry he thought he could channel and control starts to run amok. Bengelsdorf typifies a lethal combination of confidence to the point of gullibility and an excessive fondness of power, which breed complicity in wrongdoing. (We learn the telling detail that he has a well-bred Confederate pedigree.) Though he never says the words himself, he also contributes to the \u201cit can\u2019t happen here\u201d mentality, if only because he believes he\u2019ll be able to stop it.</p> <p>He plays as a searing comment on the likes of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shmuley_Boteach\">Rabbi Shmuley Boteach</a>, a worldwide <em>shanda</em> cozying up to President Trump in the presumptive belief that he\u2019ll be exempt from the hatred now being seeded. He represents a sizable Jewish component in Trump\u2019s base, hardline conservatives convinced that he\u2019ll have their back. That faction receives an avatar in The Plot Against America via Winona Ryder\u2019s Evelyn, sister to Levin family mother Bess (Zoe Kazan). Evelyn gravitates to Bengelsdorf as his eventual wife and professional partner, after he hires her as a high-ranking officer to carry out a government initiative sending young Jews to spend the summer in middle America.

His work and the superb small-screen drama it has inspired note that the Jews have a unique vulnerability to public hate-mongering due to their distinct collective identity. Lindbergh constantly draws a distinction between Americans and Jews, as if a link to their fellow worshippers in Europe makes them second-class citizens. It\u2019s a warning relevant to today\u2019s Jews, as the conversational third rail of Israel and Palestine complicates the relationship between America\u2019s Jewish population and its own government. (While openly disdainful of many actual Jews, Trump has been ardent in his pro-Israel messaging.)</p> <p>Sowing disunity proves the most effective tool in the authoritarian toolbox. As much as The Plot Against America serves to assess an era or a nation, it\u2019s about the crack-up of a family at the core, the real-life toll exacted by these big political ideas. It\u2019s a harrowing reminder that \u201cthe Jews\u201d exist as little more than a remote idea to many, more readily persecuted when stripped of their personhood.

  "<p>Donald Trump has extended America\u2019s national shutdown for a month, bowing to public health experts, and scientific reality, and warning that the worst of the coronavirus pandemic is yet to come.</p> \n<p>Speaking in the White House Rose Garden, the US president claimed that, if his administration keeps the death toll to 100,000, it will have done \u201ca very good job\u201d \u2013 a startling shift from his optimistic predictions of a few days ago when he said he hoped to restart the economy by Easter.</p> \n<p>Trump also undermined his plea for unity by uttering falsehoods, verbally abusing reporters and making incendiary allegations that implied health care workers were stealing masks, without providing evidence.</p> \n<p>The extended deadline marked a humiliating retreat for the president who, having squandered six precious weeks at the start of the pandemic, more recently complained that the cure is worse than the problem and floated Easter Sunday as a \u201cbeautiful timeline\u201d for reopening big swathes of the country.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/29/bankers-trump-economy-coronavirus-deaths\">Ignore the bankers \u2013 the Trump economy is not worth more coronavirus deaths | Robert Reich</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>On Sunday he claimed this had only been \u201caspirational\u201d as his advisers urged him not to move too hastily. He announced the initial 15-day period of social distancing urged by the federal government, which was due to expire on Monday, would be extended to 30 April, and said he hoped normality might return by 1 June.</p> \n<p>The guidelines recommend against big group gatherings and urge older people and anyone with existing health problems to stay at home. People were also urged to work at home when possible and avoid restaurants, bars, non-essential travel and shopping trips.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe modelling estimates that the peak in death rate is likely to hit in two weeks,\u201d Trump told reporters, with the toll already at more than 2,400. \u201cNothing would be worse than declaring victory before the victory is won. That would be the greatest loss of all.\u201d</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cWe can expect by June 1st we will be well on our way to recovery.\u201d</p> \n<p>The shift came as the full horror of the pandemic appeared to dawn on a president who long downplayed it. Dr Anthony Fauci, the government\u2019s top infectious disease expert, said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/29/anthony-fauci-coronavirus-death-toll-200000-americans\">the US could experience more than 100,000 deaths</a> and millions of infections. Fauci praised the extension as a \u201cwise and prudent\u201d decision.</p> \n<p>Trump cited projection models that said potentially 2.2 million people or more could have died had the country tried to \u201cwing it\u201d and not put social distancing measures in place. \u201cI kept asking and we did models,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are 2.2 million people would have died.</p> \n<p>\u201cAnd so, if we could hold that down, as we\u2019re saying, to 100,000 \u2013 it\u2019s a horrible number, maybe even less, but to 100,000, so we have between 100 [thousand] and 200,000 \u2013 we altogether have done a very good job.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bc3edb62b031987ed45b23ac64c29889998a4207\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc3edb62b031987ed45b23ac64c29889998a4207/0_83_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Health care workers stand outside a tent erected to test people for the Covid-19 at the Elmhurst Hospital Center in Queens, New York City.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Health care workers stand outside a tent erected to test people for the Covid-19 at the Elmhurst Hospital Center in Queens, New York City.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Kelly/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Trump also appeared to have been rattled by scenes at Elmhurst Hospital where he grew up in Queens, New York. \u201cI\u2019ve been watching that for the last week on television,\u201d he said. \u201cBody bags all over, in hallways.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve been watching them bring in trailer trucks, freezer trucks, they\u2019re freezer trucks, because they can\u2019t handle the bodies, there are so many of them. This is essentially in my community, in Queens; Queens, New York. I\u2019ve seen things that I\u2019ve never seen before.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump had minimised the threat of the coronavirus for weeks and ignored the pleas of his health secretary to investing in testing kits and breathing apparatus. The House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, told CNN\u2019s State of the Union this attitude had cost American lives. \u201cThe president, his denial at the beginning, was deadly,\u201d she said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7980e706-ca5a-4fb0-adcc-bbbb3260644c\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_lsb_gYPPrc?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Trump has long been criticised for refusing to own up to his own mistakes and shifting blame to others. In another lengthy, abrasive press conference, he pushed a conspiracy theory speculating that hospital staff may be stealing N95 masks and selling them on the black market.</p> \n<p>The current demand does not square with what hospitals usually use, he told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s a New York hospital, very \u2013 it\u2019s packed all the time. How do you go from 10 to 20 [thousand masks per week] to 300,000? Ten [thousand] to 20,000 masks, to 300,000 \u2013 even though this is different? Something is going on, and you ought to look into it as reporters. Are they going out the back door?\u201d</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cHow do you go from 10,000 to 300,000? And we have that in a lot of different places. So somebody should probably look into that, because I just don\u2019t see from a practical standpoint how that\u2019s possible to go from that to that.\u201d</p> \n<p>When a reporter asked the president to clarify, he asked for New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio to investigate, adding: \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s hoarding. I think it\u2019s maybe worse than hoarding.\u201d</p> \n<p>The comments provoked widespread outrage. Joe Kennedy III, a Democratic Congressman from Massachusetts, tweeted:<em> \u201c</em>We need supplies. We need masks. Our frontlines are suffering. Suggesting otherwise is disgusting.\u201d</p> \n<p>Joe Biden, the front runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, said: \u201cThis is ridiculous and completely false. Today\u2019s conspiracy mongering from our president is among the most reckless and ignorant moves he has made during this crisis, and there have been many.

But I don\u2019t want to be held to that, because it\u2019s \u2013 excuse me \u2013 deaths,\u201d Fauci said Sunday morning on CNN\u2019s State of the Union. \u201cBut I \u2013 I just don\u2019t think that we really need to make a projection, when it\u2019s such a moving target, that you can so easily be wrong and mislead people.\u201d</p> <p>Host Jake Tapper also asked Fauci about Trump\u2019s discussion of quarantining New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. Trump ultimately abandoned his \u201cenforceable quarantine\u201d idea in favor of a strong advisory urging residents of these states not to engage in non-essential travel. </p> <p>\u201cWe had very intensive discussions last night at the White House with the president. As you know, the original proposal was to consider seriously an enforceable quarantine. After discussions with the president, we made it clear, and he agreed, that it would be much better to do what\u2019s called a strong advisory,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cAnd the reason for that is that you don\u2019t want to get to the point where you\u2019re being \u2013 enforcing things that would create a bigger difficulty, morale and otherwise, when you could probably accomplish the same goal.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cOne of the issues is that the infection rate in New York City, in the New York City area, is about 56% of all of the new infections in the country are coming from that area. That\u2019s terrible suffering for the people of New York, which I feel myself personally, as a New Yorker,\u201d Fauci said. </p> <p>\u201cSo what was trying to be done is to get people, unless there\u2019s necessary travel, so, all nonessential travel, to just hold off, because what you don\u2019t want is people traveling from that area to other areas of the country, and inadvertently and innocently infecting other individuals,\u201d he continued.</p> <p>\u201cWe felt the better part of \u2013 way to do this would be an advisory, as opposed to a very strict quarantine. And the president agreed. And that\u2019s why he made that determination last night. And I believe he tweeted it out last night.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Deborah Birx, White House coronavirus task force coordinator, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/governors-warn-shortages-will-put-their-states-dire-straits-early-n1171531\">said</a> on NBC\u2019s Meet The Press that Covid-19 would impact the entire US. </p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been raising the alert in all metro areas and in all states. No state, no metro area will be spared,\u201d she said. </p> <p> \u201cThe sooner we react, and the sooner the states and the metro areas react and ensure that they put in full mitigation, at the same time understanding exactly what their hospitals need,\u201d Birx continued, \u201cthen we\u2019ll be able to move forward together and protect the most Americans\u201d.</p> <p>Fauci and Birx\u2019s comments this morning stand in contrast with Trump\u2019s previous expressions of optimism. </p> <p>His statements suggesting that parts of the US could reopen by Easter conflict with public health officials, as well as state and local authorities, who have repeatedly emphasized that things are poised to get far worse, not better, in the near future. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-29T15:47:46.581Z\">at 4.47pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e80b91e8f081e5eda239062\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/richardluscombe\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-29T15:12:15.189Z\">4.12pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>On NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, host Chuck Todd questioned Joe Biden about the fine line between constructive criticism and \u201cback-seat driving\u201d in a time of national crisis. <br></p> <p>\u201cThe line for me is to tell the truth,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIf I see something that\u2019s not happening I think it\u2019s my obligation to step up and say, \u2018This is what we should be doing\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cLook, the coronavirus is not the president\u2019s fault but the slow response, the failure to get going right away, the need to do the things that needed to be done quickly, they are the things that can\u2019t continue.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to go through another phase of this and we have to be ahead of the curve.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/29/pelosi-trump-coronavirus-response-inaction-delays\">Pelosi accuses Trump of costing US lives with coronavirus denials and delays</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Biden would not be drawn on whether there was blood on Trump\u2019s hands, as House speaker <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/29/coronavirus-us-live-new-york-cases-quarantine-news-updates-trump?page=with:block-5e809f308f0878a2a48ac6e1#block-5e809f308f0878a2a48ac6e1\">Nancy Pelosi suggested earlier</a>.

First, Donald Trump ignored official advice against unnecessary travel and went to Norfolk, Virginia, to see off the USNS Comfort, a huge ship headed for New York harbour to provide extra hospital beds to a city health system on the verge of collapse. </p> <p>As he did so, the president floated without fanfare the idea of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/28/donald-trump-virginia-usns-comfort-travel\">some sort of quarantine for New York, New Jersey and Connecticut</a>. This first took New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, by surprise, then made him angry. The dubious legality of such a move aside, Cuomo said, it would lead to \u201cchaos and mayhem\u201d and amount to a \u201cfederal declaration of war\u201d on the states involved.</p> <p>Trump backed off, but the federal CDC later issued <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/29/coronavirus-states-touching-new-york-city-told-to-stop-non-essential-travel\">stern advisory against non-essential travel</a> in the tri-state area. In Rhode Island, all the while, national guard troops were knocking on doors, looking for New Yorkers to quarantine. Cuomo wasn\u2019t happy about that, either.</p> <p>And so on Sunday the US awoke to another day of fear and uncertainty.
