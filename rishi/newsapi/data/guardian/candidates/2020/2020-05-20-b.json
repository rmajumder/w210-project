Given his track record, Meyers said, it makes sense that Trump would claim to personally take a potentially dangerous drug he\u2019s been hawking as a miracle cure for weeks, citing \u201cI get a lot of positive calls about it\u201d as evidence.</p> <p>\u201cYour evidence is that you hear good stories and get positive calls about it \u2026 we\u2019re talking about a potentially dangerous medication, not the new hibachi place in town,\u201d said Meyers.</p> <p>\u201cLook, Trump\u2019s gonna say and do crazy shit,\u201d Meyers added. \u201cHe failed on the pandemic response and unemployment is at its highest point in 100 years, so now he\u2019s spraying ink in the water so he can dart under a rock before the press can figure out what happened. We don\u2019t have to spend all day dissecting it, debating whether it\u2019s a chess move or a planned distraction \u2013 the guy doesn\u2019t play chess. He doesn\u2019t even know how to close an umbrella. Watching him play chess would be like asking your dog to change the channel on the remote control.\u201d</p> <p>The drug\u2019s benefits are unproven, Meyers continued, and side-effects can include agitation, confusion, insomnia, mania, hallucinations and paranoia. \u201cSo either Trump\u2019s lying about taking it \u2026 or he\u2019s been taking it for 73 years.\u201d</p>",

The current, acute crisis in unemployment is likely to become a chronic condition that, even if it waxes and wanes, will not remedy itself. Like the Great Depression, it demands intervention not only to resume trade and employment, but also to preserve the institutions we cherish.</p> <p>The virus will not simply evaporate; many of the jobs that used to exist have already gone, and more will go still. We will have to feel our way to reviving industries in a world altered by fear of contagion. People will want to avoid human contact to a greater degree than ever before, accelerating existing trends toward greater automation and socially distanced work. Economic busts generally foster market consolidation, as bigger operators weather a storm that swamps smaller enterprises. These effects have an inequitable impact, hurting the poor far more than the rich, demonstrating the cruel effects of inept or inactive governments. For all the clamour that the economy is in peril, what remains of democracy is in far greater danger of perishing from this new depression without some form of new New Deal.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Hoover ran for re-election in 1932, claiming his policies had ended the depression and urging voters to be grateful to him. They chose Roosevelt</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The United States tried denial as its first response to the Great Depression of the early 20th century. In 1929, President Herbert Hoover said: \u201cAny lack of confidence in the economic future or the basic strength of business in the United States is foolish.\u201d When his scolding failed, Hoover insisted that government could do nothing to alleviate the crisis. \u201cEconomic depression can not be cured by legislative action or executive pronouncement,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Soaring unemployment finally provoked political action<em><strong>.</strong></em> Hoover allowed a federal public works programme that provided, he noted with satisfaction, sustenance to some 700,000 Americans and their families; at the time, about seven million remained unemployed. Hoover ran for re-election in 1932, claiming his policies had ended the depression and urging voters to be grateful to him: \u201cLet\u2019s be thankful for the presence in Washington of a Republican administration.\u201d He pledged a balanced budget, higher tariffs and tighter monetary policy. Unpersuaded, voters chose Franklin D Roosevelt. <br><br>Roosevelt promised public works and jobs, labour rights, and a transition to more sustainable practices of production. He acknowledged that he, too, would like a balanced budget \u2013 once the nation had spent the necessary amount to end the depression. He espoused \u201cthe philosophy of social justice\u201d, rejecting \u201ctrickle down\u201d prosperity and preferring instead to \u201cmake the average of mankind comfortable and secure [so] their prosperity will rise upward, just as yeast rises up\u201d.<br><br>Taking office in March 1933, with more than ten million unemployed, Roosevelt and Democratic majorities in Congress delivered looser monetary policy, price support for agriculture, union rights and billions of dollars for public works and employment. Economic recovery began immediately and continued thereafter, with rapid growth that nevertheless took years to make up ground lost during the Hoover years.<br><br>It took several tries to get the jobs programme going. First, the Roosevelt administration bankrolled projects to be managed at the local level. But major works required advance planning, and by the end of summer 1933, only 250,000 Americans had jobs on such projects. Some smaller works did get under way, but letting local governments run them meant there were inequities in working conditions and wages, along with varying degrees of managerial competence.<br><br></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"423defdb18168a907bfc753e73c32a127cc589d9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/423defdb18168a907bfc753e73c32a127cc589d9/0_14_5019_3013/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Unemployed men queuing fat a soup kitchen run by the Bahai Fellowship at 203 East 9th Street, New York, circa 1930.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Unemployed men queuing fat a soup kitchen run by the Bahai Fellowship at 203 East 9th Street, New York, circa 1930.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: FPG/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Eventually the Roosevelt administration decided to hire workers itself, on projects of all kinds in all states and territories. Mandating eight-hour days and 40-hour weeks, calibrating wages to assure a decent standard of living, and barring child labour, the public works programmes set national expectations for working conditions. Racial discrimination on the works was prohibited first by rule and then by law; the public works programmes gave black Americans unprecedented economic opportunities, even in an age of continued segregation.<br><br>Mostly, the workers were builders. They installed or improved more than half a million miles of roads. They built schools, parks, libraries, post offices, seaports and airports; bridges and hydroelectric dams; stadiums and theatres and \u2014 humble but vital \u2013 sidewalks. They brought power \u2013 electrical, to be sure, but with it political and symbolic \u2013 to people and parts of the country that never had it before.<br><br></p> <p>Even with three to four million workers at once on its payroll, Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal was still too small: as many more citizens remained unemployed. To dispel the depression, the New Deal should have grown bigger, sooner. Washington remained fearful of spending the necessary sums until after the war. But economic recovery was not the New Deal\u2019s only aim.<br><br>The depression had brought self-government into global disrepute. The apparent incapacity or unwillingness of elected officials eroded faith in representative government and emboldened dictators. Roosevelt wanted the New Deal public works programmes to prove that democracy worked, and for everyone. Recovery could not begin anywhere unless it began everywhere: \u201cinterdependence is the watchword of this age\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/18/covid-6m-britons-fear-losing-their-jobs-despite-chancellor-measures\">Despite UK furlough scheme 6 million fear losing their job \u2013 study</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Perhaps no part of the New Deal reflected this commitment so well as the programmes for artists, musicians, and writers \u2013 cheap, compared to construction, but without them the construction would have had less meaning. The New Deal was the biggest peacetime expression of national purpose in American history. New Deal art reflected this notion. Writers and artists documented the memories of formerly enslaved people, the music of rural folks and the lives of workers in factory and field, and by making art out of them acknowledged their importance. This version of democracy, built on the interdependence of a variety of peoples, became Roosevelt\u2019s vision for the United Nations.<br><br></p> <p>During this pandemic, sheltering in place \u2013 or staying at home \u2013 has robbed us of the common spaces that were vital to the New Deal\u2019s cultural programme. We cannot congregate in theatres or stadiums, or even stop to chat in the street. Yet our interdependence is no less real for its intangibility. We should remember that cornerstone of the New Deal.</p> <p>We can learn, too, from New Dealers\u2019 commitment to providing people not only with a social safety net but with jobs to lift them out of unemployment. We might also take as a model the New Deal programme of public works that modernised the economy and adapted it to the world that was then new; advocates for a global \u201cgreen new deal\u201d have long contended that we need a new infrastructure to prepare ourselves for a more sustainable way of life.</p> <p>We might also learn from the New Deal\u2019s deficiencies. We should be bold, going bigger sooner and erring on the side of too much rather than too little, and uncompromising in seeking equity. And we should remember that the purpose of a jobs programme is not only to provide economic stimulus, but also the dignity of work at a decent wage under good conditions to all who can do it, and moreover to remind us that, should enough of us choose it, we can prove that democracy works.</p> <p>\u2022 Eric Rauchway is distinguished professor of history at the University of California, Davis.

ProPublica <a href=\"https://www.propublica.org/article/two-coasts-one-virus-how-new-york-suffered-nearly-10-times-the-number-of-deaths-as-california\">recently released a report outlining catastrophic missteps</a> by Cuomo and the New York City mayor, Bill de Blasio, which probably resulted in many thousands of needless coronavirus cases. ProPublica offers some appalling numbers contrasting what happened in New York with the outbreak in California. By mid-May, New York City alone had almost 20,000 deaths, while in San Francisco there had been only 35, and New York state as a whole suffered 10 times as many deaths as California.</p> <p>Federal failures played a role, of course, but this tragedy was absolutely due, in part, to decisions by the governor. Cuomo initially \u201creacted to De Blasio\u2019s idea for closing down New York City with derision\u201d, saying it \u201cwas dangerous\u201d and \u201cserved only to scare people\u201d. He said the \u201cseasonal flu was a graver worry\u201d. A spokesperson for Cuomo \u201crefused to say if the governor had ever read the state\u2019s pandemic plan\u201d. Later, Cuomo would blame the press, including the New York Times for failing to say \u201cBe careful, there\u2019s a virus in China that may be in the United States?\u201d even though the Times wrote <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jorgearangure/status/1255180205678886919\">nearly 500 stories</a> on the virus before the state acted. Experts told ProPublica that \u201chad New York imposed its extreme social distancing measures a week or two earlier, the death toll might have been cut by half or more\u201d.</p> <p>But delay was not the only screw-up. Elderly prisoners <a href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/coronavirus/ny-coronavirus-new-york-medical-parole-20200507-i7tr6ginbnfupizijzp5lmykjm-story.html\">have died</a> of coronavirus because New York has failed to act on their medical parole requests. As Business Insider documented:</p> <p><em>\u201cTesting was <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/slow-start-for-rapid-coronavirus-tests-frustrates-states-11586597401\">slow</a>.

And medical experts like the former CDC director <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DrTomFrieden/status/1247184873615433729\">Tom Frieden</a> said \u2018so many deaths could have been prevented\u2019 had New York issued its stay-at-home order just \u2018days earlier\u2019 than it did. On March 19, when New York\u2019s schools had already been closed, Cuomo said \u2018in many ways, the fear is more dangerous than the virus.\u2019\u201d</em></p> <p>The governor has failed to take responsibility for the obvious failures, consistently blaming others and at one point even saying \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/28/nyregion/andrew-cuomo-bugle-coronavirus.html\">governors don\u2019t do pandemics</a>\u201d. (Actually, some governors just don\u2019t read their state\u2019s pandemic plans.) But much of the press has ignored this, focusing instead on Cuomo\u2019s aesthetic presentation: his poise during press conferences, his dramatic statements about \u201ctaking responsibility\u201d (even when he obviously hasn\u2019t), and his invisible good looks.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Cuomo\u2019s record was shameful long before coronavirus began</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The <a href=\"https://www.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/politics/albany/2020/04/29/andrew-cuomo-new-york-mural-donated-masks-ny-then-social-media-weighed/3048534001/\">mask mural</a> is yet another publicity stunt mistaken by the press as a sign of leadership. On 29 April, Cuomo unveiled a wall of handmade cloth masks that had been sent to his office by concerned citizens all over America. He called it \u201ca self-portrait of America. You know what that spells? It spells love.\u201d Since the arrangement of masks doesn\u2019t form words, the mural doesn\u2019t actually spell anything, but it is a perfect symbol of Cuomo\u2019s leadership failures. Handmade cloth face coverings are not as effective as N95 masks, of course, but if unsuitable for healthcare workers they would still have been perfectly appropriate to distribute to New Yorkers (some of whom have been brutally <a href=\"https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/mom-arrested-after-confrontation-with-nypd-officers-over-face-mask/2416440/\">arrested</a> for not wearing masks). But Cuomo, rather than putting the needs of New Yorkers first, chose to tack hundreds of cloth masks on a wall as a monument to himself.</p> <p>Cuomo\u2019s record was shameful long before coronavirus began. He enabled the IDC (Independent Democratic Conference), a group of conservative Democratic state lawmakers, in allying with the Republican minority to block progressive legislation. (Cuomo denies any role in the IDC, but <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2016/05/another-cuomo-noninterference-story-falls-apart-049022\">that stretches credulity</a>.) Before the pandemic, he pushed through <a href=\"https://www.uticaod.com/news/20190310/hospitals-warn-against-cuomos-proposed-medicaid-cuts\">Medicaid cuts</a> which shut down necessary hospital space in the name of \u201cefficiency\u201d despite the warnings of medical professionals. And on 3 April, as 3,000 New Yorkers already lay dead from the virus and hospitals like <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/05/opinion/coronavirus-elmhurst-queens.html\">Elmhurst</a> in Queens were overwhelmed with cases, Cuomo forced through further Medicaid cuts, slashing <a href=\"https://www.cityandstateny.com/articles/policy/budget/medicaid-cuts-make-state-budget-some-tweaks.html\">$400m</a> from hospital budgets.</p> <p>As the state now staggers to its feet, Cuomo has partnered with the <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2020/05/06/cuomo-questions-why-school-buildings-still-exist-says-new-york-will-work-with-bill-gates-reimagine-education/\">Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation</a> to \u201creimagine education\u201d (which almost certainly means <a href=\"https://www.syracuse.com/schools/2020/05/critics-slam-gov-cuomos-plan-to-reimagine-schools-with-bill-gates-foundation.html\">privatization</a>), and with the ex-Google chief <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2020/may/13/naomi-klein-how-big-tech-plans-to-profit-from-coronavirus-pandemic\">Eric Schmidt</a> to \u2013 as Naomi Klein puts it \u2013 \u201cpermanently integrat[e] technology into every aspect of civic life\u201d. All of this has happened without the democratic input of New Yorkers, who would likely prefer that the progressive legislators they elected could govern without interference, that their hospitals have enough money to function and that billionaires don\u2019t infiltrate and control every element of civic life.</p> <p>There\u2019s something disturbing about Cuomo being hailed as the hero of the pandemic when he should rightly be one of the villains. As Business Insider notes, he is now only able to attain praise for his actions because his earlier failures made those actions necessary. He\u2019s lauded for addressing a problem that he himself partly caused. Of course, part of this is because Donald Trump has <a href=\"https://www.currentaffairs.org/2020/04/notes-on-a-nightmare-4-the-criminality-of-donald-trump\">bungled the coronavirus response even more badly</a>, so that Cuomo \u2013 by not being a complete buffoon \u2013 looks like a capable statesman by contrast. But this is the problem: for too long, Democrats have measured their politicians by \u201cwhether they are better than Republicans\u201d. This sets the bar very low indeed, and means that Democrats end up settling for incompetent and amoral leaders who betray progressive values again and again.</p> <ul> <li><p>Lyta Gold is the managing editor and amusements editor of Current Affairs.

  "<p>Diving into the campaign app for Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign results in a radically different experience than the app for Joe Biden\u2019s campaign.</p> <p>It is a difference that illustrates a key aspect of how the Trump campaign is going about organizing online during the coronavirus pandemic versus Biden\u2019s effort: the former is mobilizing its own base, and the latter is seeking to broaden it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/19/trump-hydroxychloroquine-covid-19-white-house\">Trump is taking hydroxychloroquine, White House confirms</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Trump campaign\u2019s app and digital footprint increasingly reflects an emphasis on activating its passionate communities of supporters. Meanwhile, the Biden campaign has thus far taken a far more traditional approach, with an app and organizing events that point more to the list-building approach common among federal and statewide campaigns. It allows for voters that aren\u2019t necessarily hardcore Democrats or Biden supporters.</p> <p>In a campaign where door-to-door knocking is limited because of the coronavirus, strategists are having to explore new online ways of rallying voters and collecting information on potential supporters.</p> <p>\u201cPeople don\u2019t want you to knock on their door any more. Digital does that now. They haven\u2019t wanted to go to events. Only old people want to go to events. Well, you\u2019ve seen digital solve all that with Zoom. You\u2019ve seen digital solve that with an app,\u201d said Republican strategist Jim McIntosh. \u201cCoronavirus has sped up the natural cycle of things. We were already going this way but digital impact will have the biggest impact this year.\u201d</p> <p>Strategists have taken note of the differences in the two presidential campaigns\u2019 approach.</p> <p>\u201cWhat Trump is doing with the app that I think is so interesting \u2026 is he\u2019s really building up this idea of \u2018us versus them. You\u2019re on our team. You\u2019re with us,\u2019\u201d said Democratic digital strategist Stefan Smith, former online engagement director for Pete Buttigieg\u2019s presidential campaign.</p> <p>\u201cSo you become this sort of under-siege political minority \u2026 because that\u2019s the language they\u2019re using, even though they\u2019re winning. That mentality keeps them feeling like, \u2018OK, we have to stay together\u2019, and then you\u2019re getting constant uploads.\u201d</p> <p>The difference between the two apps is apparent from the minute the downloads have completed.</p> <p>The Trump campaign app sends out multiple email alerts over a few days \u2013 the Biden campaign app over the same period barely sent out any. Both campaign apps offer updated lists of events, but the Trump campaign app also offers other ways to help it. You can help registering voters, become \u201ca bundler\u201d for fundraising, \u201cHost a Maga meet-up\u201d, join the campaign\u2019s election day team, or \u201cBecome a Trump team leader\u201d. There\u2019s also a point system on the app for rewards.</p> <p>\u201cThis is about energizing the base and getting more out of the same people,\u201d said Republican strategist and ad maker Will Ritter.</p> <p>For the Biden campaign app, there are standard links to make calls, send texts, volunteer and donate, and a list of campaign events. But there is no point system. And the variety of ways to engage with the campaign is smaller.</p> <p>It\u2019s a similar situation with supporter events online. Both campaigns send out fundraising and supporter emails. Both campaigns have migrated mostly to holding events online with surrogates. For Biden, it\u2019s often himself and other elected officials or leaders of various wings of the Democratic party; for Trump, it\u2019s minor icons within the larger Trump movement.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ce6a4c25238e0c0be1726a452933d2d498c8a6fb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce6a4c25238e0c0be1726a452933d2d498c8a6fb/0_113_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Biden in San Diego last year.

His campaign has been on a hiring spree, bringing in a swath of new digital staffers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Blake/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the Trump campaign has been much more aggressive about slicing up and offering various groups for Trump supporters. The campaign regularly distributes a weekly broadcast schedule of online events with groups like \u201cBlack Voices for Trump\u201d and \u201cMaga Mamas\u201d and an event featuring Lara Trump, the president\u2019s daughter-in-law. Trump himself doesn\u2019t participate in those events but he doesn\u2019t have to as he has the bully pulpit of his office. Oftentimes during the pandemic official White House events involving Trump have been featured live on major cable networks.</p> <p>Smith said that another major difference between the campaign\u2019s online approach has been the types of voters the campaigns are trying to reach.</p> <p>\u201c[The Trump] ecosystem is really about sharing, putting things on your own social media profile. Like if you look at the instructions on the app,\u201d Smith said, pointing to the step-by-step instructions on the Trump campaign app to invite friends and use specific hashtags.</p> <p>Those directions are for a specific audience of older Trump supporters who may not be as savvy as younger voters. \u201cIt has instructions in the app \u2013 \u2018How do you sign up for a Facebook page?\u2019 Not: how do you post on one? But they\u2019re helping their older supporters get on Facebook just to spread news about the president to earn points so that they can maybe see him and get merch or whatever.\u201d</p> <p>Smith added: \u201cThis is a base strategy. This is the assumption that if we can get everybody in the same direction and we don\u2019t lose anybody then we can keep them.\u201d</p> <p>Even before the Democratic presidential primary shrank to only Biden, strategists fretted about the data lead Republicans and the Trump campaign had been building over their Democratic rivals. </p> <p>\u201cAs a digital professional, the Trump campaign scares me a little,\u201d Smith warned. \u201cThey have so much runway, they have so much data.\u201d</p> <p>The Biden campaign has been working to catch up. Recently the campaign has been on a hiring spree, bringing in a swath of new digital staffers.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/19/has-trump-been-trying-out-his-own-dodgy-medical-advice-it-would-explain-a-few-things\">Has Trump been trying out his own dodgy medical advice?

  "<p><em> </em>In July 2017, William Perry Pendley, a crusading conservative attorney, delivered a speech to a group of rightwing activists in North Carolina in which he was completely candid about his ideological commitments.</p> <p>He accused \u201cthe media\u201d of selling \u201ctheir soul to the greens\u201d. <strong> </strong>And after criticizing the Endangered Species Act, he made light of killing endangered species.</p> <p>\u201cThis is why out west we say \u2018shoot, shovel and shut up\u2019 when it comes to the discovery of endangered species on your property,\u201d he said, according to an audio recording of the event obtained by the Guardian. \u201cAnd I have to say, as a lawyer, that\u2019s not legal advice,\u201d he added, as some in his audience quietly snickered at the reference to the illegal extermination, and the burial, of endangered animals.</p> <p>It has been almost three years since he gave those remarks, and Pendley is now the acting director of the Bureau of Land Management, or BLM, a powerful agency that oversees more than 240m acres of federal land belonging to the American people, manages mineral resources and is required to comply with environmental laws like the Endangered Species Act.</p> <p>Pendley has helped turn BLM into what one high-level employee, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals, called \u201ca ghost ship\u201d in which \u201csuspicion\u201d, \u201cfear\u201d and \u201clow morale\u201d abound, despite the best efforts of career civil servants to support each other.</p> <p>As Pendley and his superiors at the interior department press ahead with an effort to move BLM\u2019s headquarters from Washington DC to Grand Junction, Colorado, the agency has hemorrhaged staff members and lost critical institutional memory, which many critics believe was the true purpose of the relocation effort all along.</p> <p>\u201cA skeleton crew is left\u201d at BLM headquarters, said the employee. \u201cSo few people were able to move west that a lot of people retired early and a lot of people took other jobs, so my ballpark estimate is there is only about 20% of permanent employees left\u201d at headquarters. As a result, the agency is failing to fulfill its most basic duties, like responding to public records requests and conducting oversight of state and regional operations, the staffer added.</p> <p>Environmental and government watchdog groups are now responding with a lawsuit that calls into question the legitimacy of Pendley\u2019s position. Last week a pair of environmental nonprofits sued the interior department, alleging that by repeatedly tapping Pendley as the BLM\u2019s acting director, rather than officially nominating him for the position, the interior secretary has skirted the Senate confirmation process usually required for high-level executive branch appointments, and has violated federal law. </p> <p>\u201cThe illegitimate Pendley appointment is particularly troublesome because he has forcibly moved the BLM Headquarters from Washington DC, to remote western Colorado,\u201d said Peter Jenkins, a senior counsel at Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, one of the groups that sued. \u201cIn doing so he uprooted the lives of scores of seasoned BLM staff and disrupted this already strained agency.\u201d</p> <p>An interior department spokesperson defended Pendley\u2019s record.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cad7a5caa1502b7d37e1a714f03eb132adce28b0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cad7a5caa1502b7d37e1a714f03eb132adce28b0/0_236_4988_2994/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Trump administration rolled back key provisions of the Endangered Species Act, a law credited with saving the gray wolf, bald eagle and grizzly bear.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Trump administration rolled back key provisions of the Endangered Species Act, a law credited with saving the gray wolf, bald eagle and grizzly bear.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karen Bleier/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cMr Pendley brings a wealth of knowledge and experience to the department and is committed to carrying out the administration\u2019s priorities and achieving the BLM\u2019s \u2026 mission for the betterment of the American people,\u201d said Conner Swanson, the spokesperson. \u201cMr Pendley has provided a steady hand in facilitating important matters, from the BLM headquarters move west to its response to Covid-19.\u201d Swanson has said that the lawsuit against Pendley is \u201cbaseless\u201d.</p> <p>Pendley, a tall man with a handlebar mustache and a penchant for cowboy boots, has remarked in the past that his \u201cpersonal opinions are irrelevant\u201d to his job at BLM.</p> <p>\u201cI have a new job now. I\u2019m a zealous advocate for my client. My client is the American people and my bosses are the president of the United States and [interior] secretary [David] Bernhardt,\u201d Pendley said during an appearance at <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/william-perry-pendley-climate_n_5da0bcffe4b087efdbaddc0b\">the </a><a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/william-perry-pendley-climate_n_5da0bcffe4b087efdbaddc0b\">conference</a> of the Society of Environmental Journalists in Fort Collins, Colorado, last year. \u201cWhat I thought, what I wrote, what I did in the past is irrelevant. I have orders, I have laws to obey, and I intend to do that.\u201d</p> <p>Pendley has long opposed public lands and wildlife protections. After serving in the Reagan administration in the 1980s, he became the president of the Mountain States Legal Foundation (MSLF), a conservative litigation organization funded by conservative and industry groups including the Charles Koch Foundation and Exxon Mobil, according to research from the watchdog groups Documented and Accountable.US.</p> <p>Under Pendley\u2019s leadership, the firm was a persistent foe of federal land agencies, getting involved in dozens of cases on behalf of industry groups and private landowners to challenge environmental protections implemented by the interior department. </p> <p>Pendley became something of a fixture among the anti-government set, writing numerous books extolling rebellion against public lands and the federal government. He has expressed sympathy in the past for the Bundy family, whose militant agitation against federal land ownership included the armed takeover of the Malheur national wildlife refuge in 2016.</p> <p>He has compared climate change to unicorns because \u201cneither exist\u201d. And in a 2016 National Review <a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/2016/01/federal-government-should-sell-western-land-follow-constitution/\">article</a>, he laid out a case that argued for the near-total abolition of federal public lands across the nation.</p> <p>Given his long history of legal advocacy on behalf of extractive industries, Pendley brought with him a 17-page recusal list of past clients, employers and investments<strong> </strong>when he took control of the BLM in 2019. The list included groups such as the American Exploration &amp; Mining Association and the Petroleum Association of Wyoming. It has been nearly impossible for the public to know whether Pendley has abided by his recusal list, however, because the BLM has failed to release his detailed official calendar to the public.</p> <p>Though Pendley has long been a committed conservative, he has not always had kind words for Donald Trump. In a 2016 <a href=\"https://dailycaller.com/2016/06/13/trump-the-polar-opposite-of-reagan/\">op-ed</a> in the Daily Caller, for instance, he said then-candidate Trump \u201cis not fit to pull off Reagan\u2019s boots\u201d.</p> <p>Apart from Pendley\u2019s role in moving BLM\u2019s headquarters to Colorado, the agency under his leadership has also repeatedly proposed <a href=\"https://www.denverpost.com/2020/04/18/blm-plan-western-colorado-public-land-drilling/\">land management plans</a> that heavily promote the <a href=\"https://missoulian.com/opinion/columnists/lets-stop-giving-oil-and-gas-control-of-public-lands/article_ea8c0d90-3af6-528c-9a88-bf040863059c.html\">energy industry</a>. In March, for instance, conservationists in Montana came out aggressively against a BLM resource management plan that they believe is far too friendly to corporate oil and gas interests, <a href=\"https://billingsgazette.com/lifestyles/recreation/conservationists-launch-fight-against-blms-management-plan-for-central-montana/article_dcdb3503-06a6-58a6-bedf-d396a8f56e1f.html\">according to</a> the Billings Gazette.</p> <p>In a statement issued earlier this year, Representative Ra\u00fal Grijalva, the chairman of the House natural resources committee, expressed his concerns over Pendley.</p> <p>\u201cAnyone who wants our land management agencies to be functional in the future needs to recognize the seriousness of what Secretary Bernhardt, acting director Pendley, and their subordinates are doing.\u201d</p>",

The current quarantine restrictions ensure that such cases are isolated and unable to spread the disease further within the community. </p> \n   <p>While AHPPC provided no specific advice on interstate borders, closure has been an effective mechanism in reducing the introduction of disease in several jurisdictions, including South Australia, Queensland and Northern Territory. </p> \n   <p>As Western Australia increases the size of mass gatherings in the hospitality, community and sports sectors in Phases 2 and 3, the re-introduction of Covid-19 back into the community from travellers could lead to substantial outbreaks that may require either delay in easing of further restrictions or re-introduction of social distancing and mass gathering measures.</p> \n   <p>Until community spread is eliminated in the affected jurisdictions, which will require at least a month to confirm (two 14-day incubation periods), opening of the interstate borders is not recommended. If the community spread is controlled, relaxation of the interstate borders could be considered after the introduction and assessment of the impact of Phase 4.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T07:58:57.360Z\">at 8.58am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec4d32f8f08a1782fa7df97\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T07:25:12.923Z\">8.25am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Anaesthetists will have access to telehealth to do pre-operative consultations, the Australian Society of Anaesthetists said. </p> \n  <p>The expansion is a \u201cmajor win,\u201d ASA president <strong>Dr Suzi Nou</strong> said, and will \u201censure anaesthetists can identify patient factors that could significantly increase the risk for complications\u201d.

China, along with other parties, has actively participated in the consultations on the draft resolution and the co-sponsoring of the draft resolution.</p> \n  <p>Second, the above-mentioned draft resolution is entirely different from what the Australia called \u201cindependent international review\u201d. For example, the draft resolution proposes to initiate at the appropriate moment an evaluation rather than to launch an \u201cindependent international review\u201d instantly, which confirms WHO\u2019s leading role instead of adopting another mechanism. The draft resolution calls for an evaluation of experience gained and lessons learnt from the WHO-coordinated international health response, rather than an inquiry based on the presumption of guilt targeting certain country. We hope Australia will read the text carefully instead of making conclusions based on assumptions.</p> \n  <p>Lastly, I want to stress that we welcome it if Australia changes its course, completely gives up its political manoeuvere and returns to the broad consensus of the international community following the relevant WHA resolution.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T02:44:10.234Z\">at 3.44am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec494eb8f08a1782fa7de65\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T02:28:04.951Z\">3.28am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Beijing calls on Australia to 'completely give up its political manoeuvre'</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry has responded to theWorld Health Assembly motion (which was led by the EU) and recommended Australia \u2018changes its course\u2019.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The spokesperson highlighted the differences between the WHA resolution and Australia\u2019s proposal of an independent international review <strong>and stressed that China welcomes it if Australia changes its course, completely gives up its political </strong><strong>manoeuvre</strong><strong> and returns to the broad consensus of the international community following the relevant WHA resolution.</strong></p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T02:39:46.283Z\">at 3.39am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec494a38f0864e579f141fb\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T02:23:54.889Z\">3.23am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Covid crisis, and the trade situation, has resulted in this announcement from the government:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Following broad industry consultation and further consideration of the impacts on industry, the Australian government has made the decision not to proceed with the Onshore Biosecurity Levy. </p> \n   <p>The department undertook a co-design process with industry to develop a levy model that was practical for industry and the government. </p> \n   <p>This process highlighted that a levy could not be implemented without significant regulatory impacts on industry and proposed levy payers. </p> \n   <p>This decision has also been made in consideration of the ongoing impacts of drought, bushfires and Covid-19 on the Australian economy and the rapidly changing global trade environment. </p> \n   <p>The department would like to thank the Industry Working Group and other stakeholders who provided valuable input and feedback on the proposed levy design. </p> \n   <p>A levy will not be progressed and this decision will not impact on the overall biosecurity budget. </p> \n   <p>Australia\u2019s biosecurity system will continue to be funded through existing arrangements. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T02:26:16.972Z\">at 3.26am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ec494418f0886ce4f5d6bff\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-20T02:23:06.199Z\">3.23am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Penny Wong </strong>also spoke to the ABC radio this morning (in Adelaide) where she repeated Labor\u2019s stance on the government\u2019s relationship with China:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I think on the inquiry, if that\u2019s the question, this is the inquiry into the pandemic, I\u2019ve made very clear from the start we supported it.<br></p> \n   <p>And we welcome the resolution at the World Health Assembly to have an inquiry, a European Union-led resolution that has many countries signed up to it, including Australia.<br></p> \n   <p>It does differ from what <strong>Marise Payne</strong> announced on Insiders, in that the World Health Organisation is doing the inquiry.

They serve in their personal capacity, they are not, if you like, part of the WHO structure.

  "<p>We\u2019re now months into our strange new socially distanced age. For some it probably feels like years already. But, for those who have remained well and those who are able to leave their homes, there has been one generally agreed upside of the pandemic: the impact on our planet. With roads empty, the sound of birdsong filling normally clogged streets and the sight of empty skies, the lockdown has given the planet a much needed breather. Cities are now beginning to reopen \u2013 many with ad hoc bike lanes to aid social distancing; and millions will be thinking about working from home for good. This year, global carbon emissions will likely drop between 6% and 8%. But to stop the planet heating by more than 1.5C, we need at least a similar drop <em>every single year</em>. The lesson from the shutdown, writes Gaia Vince in this week\u2019s cover story, is that as important as individual changes are, the shift needed remains a structural and governmental one. The Covid-19 crisis has offered us a once-in-a-lifetime glimpse of what a near-carbon-free future could look like. Can we take the opportunity?</p> <p>Voters are going to have a big role in taking that chance. Especially in the US, where Donald Trump continues to try to deflect from his handling of the crisis by attacking his predecessor and would-be successor. David Smith looks at what drives Trump\u2019s conspiracy-tinted obsession with Barack Obama. Joan E Greve explores how Trump\u2019s campaign has already turned its guns on Joe Biden. We also report on how coronavirus has become a wedge issue in November\u2019s battleground states. Elsewhere, Toby Helm reports on Boris Johnson\u2019s melting consensus in the UK and, we speak to KK Shailaja, aka the \u2018coronavirus slayer\u2019 of Kerala, who has so far kept the Indian state\u2019s cases to a minimum.</p> <p>Elsewhere this week we feature a moving essay by Laura Barton who, in early March, headed to the Greek island of Crete by herself for IVF treatment, just as the planet was about to shut down. Then Richard Godwin investigates one of Britain\u2019s most sought-after lockdown objects. It\u2019s not face masks, or bread flour, but jigsaws. Or ones with lots of pieces, at least. David Smith takes a break from the travails of the Trump administration to interview Black Mirror creator and former Guardian TV writer and columnist Charlie Brooker. We also speak to Matty Healy, the outspoken frontman of the 1975, and Stevie Chick listens to Wind of Change, a podcast that tries to answer a question nobody was asking: was the Scorpions\u2019 1990 mega-hit really a plot by the CIA to bring down the Soviet Union?</p> <p><strong>To get the Guardian Weekly delivered to your home, <a href=\"https://support.theguardian.com/uk/subscribe/weekly?promoCode=WWM62X\">click here</a></strong></p>",
  "<h2>Top story: Hottest day brings social distance warning</h2> \n<p>Hello, Warren Murray with oven-ready news, just add a minute or two of your time.</p> \n<p>Plans to introduce coronavirus tracing have been hit by fresh uncertainty with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/uk-plans-for-contact-tracing-in-doubt-as-app-not-ready-until-june\">mobile app not expected to be ready until June</a>. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, had said last week that it would be \u201crolling out in mid May\u201d across England. NHS insiders said the deployment of the app being trialled on the Isle of Wight would not take place until next month as developers iron out problems. Hancock said on Monday that 21,000 contact tracers had been recruited across England. But people recruited to contact those exposed to someone with Covid-19 have told the Guardian they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/no-one-had-any-idea-contact-tracers-lack-knowledge-about-covid-19-job\">spent days just trying to log into the online training system</a>.</p> \n<p>The capacity of parks and outdoor facilities to accommodate socially distanced sunbathers might be tested today, which is predicted to bring the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/20/fears-over-capacity-for-social-distancing-as-england-faces-29c-weather\">hottest weather of the year so far</a> including a possible high of 29C in south-east England. People are allowed to meet up with one person from another household outdoors, as long as two metres\u2019 distance is maintained. Councils have urged the public to remember that many facilities like outdoor pools and public toilets remain closed. Many tourist hotspots have asked people to stay away and said that attractions will remain closed. The majority of beaches are not currently lifeguarded although activities are allowed. Thunderstorms are predicted for Thursday.</p> \n<p>Brazil has seen its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/global-report-covid-19-brazils-deadliest-day-as-trump-calls-us-cases-a-badge-of-honour\">most deadly day since the coronavirus outbreak began</a>, prompting Donald Trump to consider a ban on travel to the US from Brazil, even as he called the large number of US cases a \u201cbadge of honour \u2026 It\u2019s a great tribute to the testing and all of the work that a lot of professionals have done.\u201d The US has the highest number of cases in the world, at more than 1.5 million with nearly 92,000 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins university tracker. Brazil overtook Britain on Monday to become the country with the third-highest number of confirmed infections, behind Russia and the US.

Abbas said the PLO and the state of Palestine \u201cwere absolved, as of today\u201d of all their agreements with the American and Israelis. It was unclear what this would mean in practice \u2013 Palestinian officials have to coordinate with Israeli officers just to move around in the West Bank. The new Israeli government is officially considering the annexations, apparently with Donald Trump\u2019s support.

  "<p>Ten years ago, when Australia\u2019s climate and energy botch-up was still in its infancy, politicians and their advisers used to talk up the virtues of gas as a transitional fuel, and they used to talk about carbon capture and storage (CCS) as technology that governments needed to invest in to drive the transition to low-emissions economies.</p> <p>The great botch-up is now well past infancy, and Australia\u2019s record on climate and energy is a disaster so profound it\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/18/for-your-children-former-top-australian-public-servants-call-for-carbon-price\">still traumatising backstage protagonists</a> years after the stadium rock wreckers have left the crime scene.</p> <p>Yet people in power are still talking within the same parameters. Gas. CCS. As if these might be new discoveries \u2013 as if the economics of the transition have remained immutable in the decade we spent watching the political class execute inter-generational failure at our expense.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/19/angus-taylor-says-it-is-not-australian-government-policy-to-achieve-net-zero-emissions-by-2050\">Angus Taylor says it is not Australian government policy to achieve net zero emissions by 2050</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Just in case you\u2019ve missed the Morrison government warming up the talking points about Australia\u2019s great gas-led recovery from the economic shock of Covid-19, allow me to bring this winter marketing offensive to your attention. The prime minister, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/20/coalition-eyes-australian-economic-sovereignty-with-boost-to-manufacturing\">several ministers</a>, and some prominent corporate advisers, like the former Fortescue boss Nev Power, are out, banging that drum.</p> <p>We are told cheap gas will help restart an economy hit for six by coronavirus. Cheap gas will boost flagging growth, create jobs, and make projects considered uneconomic five minutes ago suddenly economic.</p> <p>It is gas nirvana, as far as the eye can see \u2013 except it is unclear to me where this cheap gas will come from. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/apr/13/australias-booming-lng-industry-stalls-after-fall-in-oil-prices-amid-coronavirus\">Gas prices have fallen recently</a>, but will these falls be sustained? Are falling gas prices really the environment in which companies will pursue new investments?</p> <p>Won\u2019t they worry about stranded assets? Won\u2019t they worry about carbon risk \u2013 that being a real thing. Ask the Reserve Bank. Or the banking regulator. Or the corporate regulator. Australia\u2019s gas industry needs to be able to extract and sell the resource at a rate of return that justifies any new investments accompanying the opening up of new supply. That\u2019s a basic rule of business, unless there\u2019s some undisclosed fine print.</p> <p>Unless, of course, the real story is taxpayers are going to be saddled with the risks of marginal investments, which makes gas nirvana sound more like a billion-dollar boondoggle dreamed up by a kitchen cabinet of vested interests.</p> <p>But that doesn\u2019t sound nearly as exciting, does it?</p> <p>Just while we are on this, gas nirvana also has another dimension. It is being invoked, in part, to justify <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/19/coalition-reveals-new-emissions-reduction-measures-including-paying-polluters-to-stay-under-cap\">the reworking the miserable suite of alleged emissions reduction policies</a> that the Coalition has kept on life support since the Abbott era. If the future is gas and CCS, then the policies will need another tweak to make them fit for purpose, because low emissions are just a matter of definition.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/18/for-your-children-former-top-australian-public-servants-call-for-carbon-price\">'For your children': former top Australian public servants call for carbon price</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The government says we need to look at CCS because all the sensible people are technologically neutral, not ideological. The goal should be emissions reduction, never mind the means.</p> <p>Fine as far as it goes, except that parable lacks some context. The real story is this: Australia has failed to take meaningful action to reduce emissions, because the Coalition has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/sep/20/a-clean-energy-target-is-not-unconscionable-tony-abbott-wrecking-climate-policy-is\">wrecked progress at every turn for more than 10 years</a>.</p> <p>The truth is the Liberal and National parties have blown the critical decade. That failure is now an implicit justification for more taxpayer support for CCS, because the need may become so pressing that all options will have to be on the table to try and stave off the worst-case scenario \u2013 not that the arguments will ever be framed in such frank terms. The talking point says this: Australia can sequester emissions, we can have our fossil fuel cake and eat it too. Cue applause track.</p> <p>I need to make a couple of things clear because the climate and energy debate has become so toxic and so polarised that all nuance has departed the stage.</p> <p>I have no profound objection to gas as a transitional fuel \u2013 the operative word being transitional. If we pursue gas peaking to firm renewables, that\u2019s one thing. If we bolt gas into the system as a permanent substitute for coal, and justify that substitution on the basis that gas is marginally less emissions-intensive, that\u2019s quite another.</p> <p>I also don\u2019t object to CCS, because as I flagged a minute ago, we might actually need it. If Donald Trump somehow manages to convince Americans to re-elect him in November despite the fact the president represents a clear and present danger to his own citizens, we are going to need a whole lot more than CCS to get the world out of the climate hole it will fall into because of the sustained absence of US leadership.</p> <p>What I\u2019m saying today is two things: resources are finite, and the government has options. Let\u2019s call them option A and option B.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/16/labor-calls-for-end-to-decade-long-barney-on-climate-wars-in-post-pandemic-recovery\">Labor calls for end to 'decade-long barney' on climate wars in post-pandemic recovery</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Option A sees the Morrison government choose not to make a mockery of the international climate commitments it signed up to, voluntarily, in 2015. It can use the economic recovery from Covid-19 as an opportunity to drive a low-emissions transition, which will drive sustainable jobs and growth. The government can choose to set Australia up for half a century, not another election cycle. Plenty of smart people think that\u2019s a viable option.</p> <p>Then there\u2019s option B. The government can use the recovery from Covid-19 as cover to lock in fossil fuels for another couple of decades. It can dress up the gas-led recovery as an act of enlightened national sovereignty, a downpayment on enhancing strategic capability, knowing that concept will resonate at a time when Australians are feeling insecure about their economic prospects.</p> <p>Morrison and his ministers and advisers can gamble that a majority of Australians will care more about having a job today than saving the planet tomorrow \u2013 and the worst of it is, that\u2019s not much of a gamble.</p> <p>This sensibility broadly reflects community sentiment. This is how a majority of Australians have voted at every federal election since 2013 \u2013 and that was before we all endured the greatest economic shock since the great depression \u2013 before a global pandemic rendered community-minded activism a second-order issue, a luxury that might be resumed in due course.</p> <p>To be clear: right now, on current indications, the Coalition is limbering up for option B, and trying to make a virtue of it.</p>",
