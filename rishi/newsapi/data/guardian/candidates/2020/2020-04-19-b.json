Mosques and holy sites would be kept closed at least until 4 May, but he urged Iranians to pray at home. The holy month of Ramadan starts on 23 April.</p> \n  <p>Tehran was gridlocked with traffic on Saturday when office employees were asked to return to work. Public transport, seen as a major transmitter of the virus, is unable to cope with the passenger traffic, making government commitments to implement smart distancing largely ineffectual. Traffic into Tehran was up 70% from traffic on the same day last year, Tehran police chief Mohammad Reza Mehmandar said.</p> \n  <p>Rouhani acknowledged the dilemma, but said the solution was for councils to purchase more buses, or bring back into use those that had broken down. Crowds also gathered outside banks on Saturday to purchase a SIM card required to access a government grant of 1m Iranian toman ($23). Pictures of the crowds were emblazoned on Iranian newspapers with reporters questioning government policy. As many as 600,000 made unemployed due to the lockdown had registered for the government grant, but living standards of the middle class are also sliding. </p> \n  <p>Health ministry figures on Saturday showed the number of new deaths had fallen to a record low of 73. The number of new infections was 1,374, part of a steady downward trend. But Tehran\u2019s mayor pointed to an Iranian parliament report saying the official figures undercounted the number of deaths caused by the virus due to the lack of effective testing in hospitals. Opposition sources produce figures for deaths that are as high as 30,000, more than six times the official figures.

How on earth do you not have an opinion on aid to American cities and states?\u201d</p> <p>The Daily News front page was published after Gerald Ford gave a speech in 1975, saying he would veto a federal bill that would have helped spare New York City from bankruptcy.</p> <p>Across many US cities and states the issue of budget deficits is becoming more pressing, as governors and administrators attempt to counter the economic effects of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p> <p>Central bankers are seeking ways to revive a $4tn market for municipal bonds that allows states and cities to borrow funds for basic infrastructure spending such as schools, hospitals and highways.</p> <p>On Sunday, New Jersey\u2019s Democratic senator Bob Menendez and senator Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, a Republican, proposed a $500bn fund for state and local governments as part of the next rescue package.</p> <p>Officials for New York state, which was already facing a multi-billion budget shortfall after losing hundreds of thousands of taxpayers to states with lower taxes, has already warned the state is facing a $10bn hole caused by the pandemic in its $177bn budget.</p> <p>During his address, De Blasio said he was consulting with counterparts in Miami and Denver on how to handle the approaching financial crisis. But De Blasio\u2019s invocation of an era when crime soared, rodents infested the streets, and entire neighborhoods were considered no-go was also pointed: Trump, raised in Queens, became a classic bridge-and-tunnel entrepreneur, venturing to Manhattan first to play and ultimately to seek a fortune.</p> <p>\u201cYou are failing to protect the very people you grew up around,\u201d the mayor told the president, and warned more broadly: \u201cIf cities can\u2019t function, how on earth do you have a national recovery?\u201d</p> <p>Nearly 14,000 New Yorkers have died since the state\u2019s first coronavirus case was reported on 1 March, according to state data. The state total doesn\u2019t include more than 4,000 New York City deaths that were attributed to the virus on death certificates but weren\u2019t confirmed by a lab test.</p> <p>New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, said states also need money from the federal government to ramp up testing.</p> <p>\u201cYou have the president saying 15 times, \u2018It\u2019s up to the governors, it\u2019s up to the governors, it\u2019s up to the governors.\u2019 And then they\u2019re going to pass a piece of legislation that gives you know what to states: zero, zilch, nada, niente,\u201d Cuomo said.</p> <p>Cuomo said 507 people died from Covid-19 in New York state on Saturday, down 33 from the previous day and by 271 since last Monday. Other indicators were going in the right direction, the governor said. Hospitalizations were down by more than 750, to 16,213.</p> <p>But Cuomo and De Blasio maintained their warnings that people in New York City and the rest of the state need to stay vigilant to curb the spread of the virus.</p>",

  "<p>US governors have accused Donald Trump of making \u201cdelusional\u201d and \u201cdangerous\u201d statements amid mounting tensions between the president and state leaders over coronavirus testing and pressure to roll back stay-at-home measures.</p> <p>The United States has by far the world\u2019s largest number of confirmed coronavirus cases, with more than 730,000 infections and over 39,600 deaths.</p> <p>Many state leaders have said they cannot embark on Trump\u2019s recommended <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/openingamerica/\">three-phrase programme</a> to ease stay-at-home restrictions without a robust and widespread system of testing in place.</p> <p>Researchers at Harvard University have suggested the US should conduct more than three times the number of coronavirus tests it is currently administering over the course of the next month, the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/17/us/coronavirus-testing-states.html\">New York Times reported</a>.</p> <p>Democratic governor Ralph Northam of Virginia told CNN on Sunday that claims by Trump and Vice-President Mike Pence that states have plenty of tests were \u201cjust delusional\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe have been fighting for testing,\u201d he said on CNN\u2019s State of the Union. \u201cWe don\u2019t even have enough swabs, believe it or not.

Boston and Chicago are also emerging hot spots with recent surges in cases and deaths.</p> <p>\u201cThe administration I think is trying to ramp up testing, they are doing some things with respect to private labs,\u201d said Republican governor Larry Hogan of Maryland during a CNN interview. \u201cBut to try to push this off, to say the governors have plenty of testing and they should just get to work on testing, somehow we aren\u2019t doing our jobs, is just absolutely false.\u201d</p> <p>Several states, including Ohio, Texas and Florida, have said they aim to reopen parts of their economies, perhaps by 1 May or even sooner, but appeared to be staying cautious.</p> <p>The White House guidelines released late last week on reopening the economy recommend a state record 14 days of declining case numbers before gradually lifting restrictions. Yet in a series of tweets from Trump on Friday, the president called for the \u201cliberation\u201d of Minnesota, Michigan and Virginia, Democratic-led states with strict stay-at-home orders, and appeared to be the catalyst for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/18/stay-at-home-order-protest-lockdown-maryland-texas-ohio\">protests backed by right</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/18/stay-at-home-order-protest-lockdown-maryland-texas-ohio\">wing groups</a> in several places, including Texas, Maryland and Ohio.</p> <p>In his tweet on Friday the president <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1251169987110330372\">claimed without evidence</a> that Virginia citizens\u2019 second amendment rights were \u201cunder siege\u201d after Northam signed into law <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/11/virginia-governor-ralph-northam-signs-bills\">tighter firearms restrictions</a> a week earlier.</p> <p>In Austin, the Texas state capital, protesters called on Trump to fire Dr Anthony Fauci, the leading US expert on infectious diseases, from his task force tackling the pandemic crisis.</p> <p>Washington governor Jay Inslee, a Democrat who on Friday blasted Trump\u2019s tweets as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/17/trump-liberate-tweets-coronavirus-stay-at-home-orders\">\u201cunhinged rantings\u201d</a>, and one of the most vocal critics of the president, reinforced his position on Sunday.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know any other way to characterize it,\u201d Inslee told host George Stephanopoulos on ABC\u2019s This Week. \u201cTo have an American president encourage people to violate the law, I can\u2019t remember any time during my time in America where we have seen such a thing. And it is dangerous because it can inspire people to ignore things that actually can save their lives.</p> <p>\u201cIt is doubly frustrating to us governors because this is such a schizophrenia. The president is basically asking people, \u2018Please ignore Dr Fauci and Dr Birx [White House taskforce medical advisers], please ignore <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/03.16.20_coronavirus-guidance_8.5x11_315PM.pdf\">my own guidelines that I set forth</a>,\u2019 because those guidelines made very clear\u2026 that you cannot open up Michigan today, or Virginia, under those guidelines. You need to see a decline in the infections and fatalities. And that simply has not happened yet.\u201d</p> <p>Pence insisted in an interview aired on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press on Sunday that the country had \u201csufficient capacity\u201d for any state to go to the phase one level.</p> <p>But Hogan and others said the issue was not as straightforward as Pence presented it.</p> <p>\u201cEvery governor in America has been pushing and fighting and clawing to get more tests, not only from the federal government, but from every private lab in America and from all across the world. It\u2019s not accurate to say there\u2019s plenty of testing out there, and the governors should just get it done.\u201d</p> <p>Hogan said he was sympathetic to the protesters. \u201cI\u2019m frustrated also,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think it\u2019s helpful to encourage demonstrations. To encourage people to go protest the plan that you just made recommendations on, it just doesn\u2019t make any sense. We\u2019re sending completely conflicting messages out to the governors and to the people, as if we should ignore federal policy and federal recommendations.\u201d</p> <p>Gretchen Whitmer, the Democratic governor of Michigan, where some of the earliest protests took place last week, once again strongly defended strict lockdown restrictions in her state, the 10th largest by population but third highest in the nation in terms of Covid-19 deaths.</p> <p>\u201cMy stay-home order is one of the nation\u2019s more conservative but the fact of the matter is it\u2019s working. We are seeing the curve start to flatten and that means we\u2019re saving lives,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201c[But] I can tell you, we could double or even triple the number of tests if we had the swabs and reagents. That\u2019s precisely why it would really be incredibly helpful if the federal government would use the Defense Production Act to start making these swabs and reagents, so we can improve testing.\u201d</p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>By late December last year, doctors in the central Chinese city of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/10/birth-of-a-pandemic-inside-the-first-weeks-of-the-coronavirus-outbreak-in-wuhan\">Wuhan </a>were starting to worry about patients quarantined in their hospitals suffering from an unusual type of pneumonia.</p> <p>As the mystery illness spread in one of China\u2019s major industrial hubs, some tried to warn their colleagues to take extra care at work, because the disease resembled Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome), the deadly respiratory disease that had killed hundreds of people across the region in 2002-03<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/apr/21/china.sars\"> after a government cover-up</a>.</p> <p>One of those who tried to raise the alarm, though only among a few medical school classmates, was a 33-year-old Chinese ophthalmologist, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/06/li-wenliang-coronavirus-whistleblower-doctor-profile\">Li Wenliang</a>. Seven people were in isolation at his hospital, he said, and the disease appeared to be a coronavirus, from the same family as Sars.</p> <p>In early January he was called in by police, reprimanded for \u201cspreading rumours online\u201d, and forced to sign a paper acknowledging his \u201cmisdemeanour\u201d and promising not to repeat it.</p> <p>Many early cases were linked to the city\u2019s Huanan seafood and fresh produce market, which also sold wildlife, suggesting that the first cases were contracted there.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"530a63bd00148e7bdeaa4e6481f85167334f3ca0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/530a63bd00148e7bdeaa4e6481f85167334f3ca0/0_0_4000_2774/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Wuhan hygiene emergency response team leave the closed Huanan seafood wholesale market on 11 January 11.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"694\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Wuhan hygiene emergency response team leave the closed Huanan seafood wholesale market on 11 January.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Noel Celis/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Scientists would discover the disease had probably originated in bats and had then passed through a second species \u2013 in all likelihood, but not certainly, pangolins, a type of scaly anteater \u2013 before infecting humans.</p> <p>But the infections were soon spreading directly between patients, so fast that on 23 January the government announced an unprecedented lockdown of Wuhan city and the surrounding Hubei province.</p> <p>Two weeks later, on 7 February, Li, who had contracted coronavirus himself, died in hospital from the condition about which he had tried to raise the alarm. He had no known underlying conditions and left behind a wife and young child.</p> <p>Li became the face of the mysterious new disease. The story of his death and pictures of him in a hospital bed wearing an oxygen mask made media headlines across the globe, including in the UK.</p> <p>The world, it seemed, was slowly becoming more aware of how lethal coronavirus could be, that it was not just another form of <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-mixed-messages-idUSKBN2102GY\">flu </a>with fairly mild symptoms.</p> <p>But while UK scientists and medical researchers were becoming more concerned, and studying the evidence from China, those among them who were most worried were not getting their messages through to high places.</p> <h2>Distracted by Brexit and reshuffles</h2> <p>The Conservative government of Boris Johnson had other more immediate preoccupations at the start of this year.</p> <p>Johnson was still basking in his general election success last December. After he returned from a celebratory Caribbean holiday with his fiancee, Carrie Symonds, the political weather for the prime minister seemed to be set fair. It was honeymoon time.</p> <p>Three and a half years on from the Brexit referendum, the UK was finally about to leave the EU on 31 January. The fireworks and parties for the big night were being planned, the celebratory 50p coins minted.</p> <p>Minds were certainly not on a developing health emergency far away, as Johnson prepared to exploit the moment of the UK\u2019s departure from the European Union for all it was worth. \u201cI think there was some over-confidence,\u201d admitted one very senior Tory last week.</p> <p>The prime minister and his chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, wanted to make an early impression at home in other ways too, as domestic reformers. Cummings was waging a war on civil servants in Whitehall, throwing his weight around and deliberately upsetting the Westminster applecart.</p> <p>While he made the headlines, briefing about his iconoclastic ambitions, Johnson was preparing a big Cabinet reshuffle to assert his own authority in other areas now Brexit was done and dusted.</p> <p>With Labour effectively leaderless after its fourth consecutive election defeat, there was little opposition to trouble Johnson on any front at all \u2013 and certainly no-one of note asking tough questions about coronavirus.</p> <p>The prime minister duly recast his cabinet team on 13 February \u2013 five days after Li\u2019s death in Wuhan. He made big changes but unsurprisingly retained the hitherto safe pair of hands of Matt Hancock as his health secretary.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4439fed8cacaafa0490d145e35714f188fc355a0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4439fed8cacaafa0490d145e35714f188fc355a0/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson speaking about the EU on 3 February.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson speaking about the EU on 3 February.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In a sign of where priorities lay \u2013 and the lack of concern that a potential crisis might be heading our way from the east \u2013 Hancock wasted no time <a href=\"https://twitter.com/matthancock/status/1227981463192309760?lang=en\">recording a video of himself</a> grinning with delight on reshuffle day.</p> <p>He smacked his right fist into his left palm saying he could not wait to \u201cget cracking\u201d and that he relished the chance to deliver the Tories\u2019 manifesto promises, reform social care and improve life sciences. And lastly, in a more sombre voice, he spoke of \u201cdealing with coronavirus and keeping the public safe\u201d before adding, as the grin returned: \u201cNow let\u2019s get back to work!\u201d</p> <p>It is perhaps too early to conclude for sure that Johnson, Hancock and the government\u2019s entire team of scientific and medical advisers were caught asleep at the wheel. But the fact that Johnson and Hancock themselves, in common with much of the Downing Street staff, would go on to contract the virus or suffer symptoms, further suggests that people at the top had not been sufficiently on their guard.</p> <p>Now, 11 weeks on from the first cases being confirmed in the UK on 31 January \u2013 a period during which <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">more than 14,000 people</a> (and probably several thousands more once care home fatalities are counted) in the UK have died from Covid-19 \u2013 and with the country in lockdown, the economy facing prolonged recession as a result, schools closed, and no sign of an end in sight \u2013 hard questions have to be asked.</p> <p>We already know with some certainty that other countries, such as Germany, South Korea, Taiwan and New Zealand, will emerge from this crisis having performed far better than the UK. A few weeks ago the government\u2019s advisers crassly said that fewer than 20,000 deaths would be \u201ca very good result\u201d for the UK.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/19/michael-gove-fails-to-deny-pm-missed-five-coronavirus-cobra-meetings\">Boris Johnson missed five coronavirus Cobra meetings, Michael Gove says</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As we fast approach that grim tally, many experts now believe the UK may come out of this crisis, whenever that may be, with one of the worst records on fighting coronavirus of any European nation. Once the full tally is counted, few expect the number of deaths to be below 20,000.</p> <p>By contrast, on Friday, Germany was saying it thought it had brought coronavirus largely under control. It had had 3,868 deaths, less a third of the total in the UK (and Germany\u2019s population, at 83 million, is far higher), having conducted widespread testing for Covid-19 from early on, precisely as the UK has failed to do.</p> <p>How, then, did it come to this? How did coronavirus spread across the globe, prompting different responses in different countries? Did the UK simply fail to heed the warnings? Or did it just decide to take different decisions, while others settled on alternative actions to save lives?</p> <h2>The warnings grow louder</h2> <p>David Nabarro, professor of global health at Imperial College, London, and an envoy for the World Health Organization on Covid-19, says one thing is for sure. All governments were warned how serious the situation was likely to become as early as the end of January. Ignorance of the danger that was coming can be no excuse. Yet it would not be until late March \u2013 later than many other countries \u2013 that Johnson would announce a complete lockdown.</p> <p>\u201cWHO had been following the outbreak since the end of December and within a few weeks it called a meeting of its emergency committee to decide if this outbreak was a \u2018public health emergency of international concern\u2019,\u201d said Nabarro.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>WHO made it very clear \u2013 to every country in the world \u2013 that we were facing something very serious indeed</p> <footer> <cite>Prof David Nabarro, Imperial College, London</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThat is the highest level of alert that WHO can issue, and it issued it on January 30. It made it very clear then \u2013 to every country in the world \u2013 that we were facing something very serious indeed.\u201d</p> <p>Well before the end of January, the WHO had been tracking the growing threat minutely: 14 January was a key day in the spread of the disease that would become known as Covid-19. The first case was confirmed outside China, with a woman hospitalised in Thailand.</p> <p>A WHO official warned then that it was possible that <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-pneumonia-who-idUSKBN1ZD16J\">human-to-human transmission</a> had occurred in families of victims \u2013 a sign that the disease had potential to spread far and fast \u2013 and, inside China, officials were quietly <a href=\"https://apnews.com/68a9e1b91de4ffc166acd6012d82c2f9?utm_source=Twitter&amp;utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;utm_medium=AP\">told to prepare for a pandemic</a>.</p> <p>There was little international attention on the day, though, because Beijing\u2019s dire warnings about a pandemic were made in secret, and a WHO spokesman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/14/case-of-mystery-coronavirus-found-outside-china-for-the-first-time-thailand\">rowed back from his colleague\u2019s claim</a>.</p> <p>Officially, China had not seen a new case of the coronavirus for over a week; the outbreak appeared to be fading. It took another six days for China to publicly acknowledge the gravity of the threat, time that scientists believed meant a further 3,000 people were infected.</p> <p>But on 20 January, officials announced more than 100 new cases and admitted the virus was spreading between humans, a red flag for concern to anyone who works on infectious diseases. The virus could no longer be contained by finding the animal source of the infection and destroying it.</p> <p>Two days later, the scale of the challenge was made clear to the general public when Beijing locked down millions of people. All transport into and out of the metropolis of Wuhan was cut off, an unprecedented modern quarantine that would come at huge human and economic cost.</p> <p>On 29 January, the UK would have its first two confirmed cases of the disease. There was little sense that China\u2019s dilemma and its approach \u2013 shut down life as we know it or watch the death toll spiral out of control \u2013 might have to be our nightmare within weeks.</p> <p>In early February, Donald Trump announced a ban on travellers who had passed through China in the previous 14 days. Europe began focused testing of people with symptoms and travel histories that linked them to the disease, but little else.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Johnson, it seemed, still had Brexit and free trade much more on his mind. Any hint of draconian action to fight coronavirus that might hurt the economy was the last thing he was entertaining.</p> <p>In a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/pm-speech-in-greenwich-3-february-2020\">speech on Brexit</a> in Greenwich on 3 February, he made clear his views on Wuhan-style lockdowns. \u201cWe are starting to hear some bizarre autarkic rhetoric,\u201d he said, \u201cwhen barriers are going up, and when there is a risk that new diseases such as coronavirus will trigger a panic and a desire for market segregation that go beyond what is medically rational to the point of doing real and unnecessary economic damage.</p> <p>\u201cThen, at that moment, humanity needs some government somewhere that is willing at least to make the case powerfully for freedom of exchange, some country ready to take off its Clark Kent spectacles and leap into the phone booth and emerge with its cloak flowing as the supercharged champion of the right of the populations of the Earth to buy and sell freely among each other.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018Herd immunity\u2019: UK goes it alone</h2> <p>By early March it was abundantly clear to many academics and scientists that the approach being adopted by the UK was markedly different from those followed by other countries. From South Korea to Germany, governments had invested heavily in expanding testing capacity from the first weeks of the epidemic.</p> <p>Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore had brought in controls on travellers from infected regions and strict contact tracing to help understand who could have been exposed, inform them and require self isolation. Face masks became widespread in east Asia, long before it was recommended elsewhere.</p> <p>Testing and contact tracing has been at the heart of the approach advocated by the WHO, so that countries can establish how transmission chains were occurring, in order to break them<em>.</em></p> <p>Many also brought in some <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-and-social-distancing-is-it-risky-to-go-to-the-pub-or-gym\" title=\"\">social distancing</a> measures, banning large gatherings, closing schools or extending holidays, and encouraged those who could do to work from home. None were as extreme as China\u2019s shutdown, or the European and American lockdowns that would follow.</p> <p>Writing in the Observer last month, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/15/britain-goes-it-alone-over-coronavirus-we-can-only-hope-the-gamble-pays-off\">Devi Sridhar</a>, chair of global public health at the University of Ediburgh, noted the distinct UK approach. \u201cRather than learning from other countries and following the WHO advice, which comes from experts with decades of experience in tackling outbreaks across the world, the UK has decided to follow its own path. This seems to accept that the virus is unstoppable and will probably become an annual, seasonal infection.</p> <p>\u201cThe plan, as explained by the chief science adviser, is to work towards \u2018herd immunity\u2019, which is to have the majority of the population contract the virus, develop antibodies and then become immune to it. This theory has been widely used to advocate for mass vaccination for measles, mumps and rubella. The thinking is that, if most of the population is vaccinated, a small percentage can go unvaccinated without cases emerging.\u201d</p> <p>It was not just the UK whose politicians and scientific advisers were, arguably, slow to act in the early stages. Others countries, including Spain and France, were caught out too, but it was Italy\u2019s tragedy that alerted Europe to the scale of the threat it faced.</p> <p>European governments and citizens were forced to reckon with the reality that in an age of global travel, the thousands of miles separating them from China meant almost nothing at all. Thousands of Britons were holidaying in Italy the week that it shut down. They were advised to go into self-quarantine on return, but were not registered by the health authorities, nor were their contacts tracked.</p> <p>Italy and the UK had both had had their first case a day apart at the end of January, but cases rose faster in Italy. The country may just have been unlucky that carriers of the disease flew to its northern cities and ski resorts rather than to other European capitals.</p> <p>Whatever the reason, cases and then deaths started climbing sharply in northern Italy in late February. Dozens of towns were locked down from the 21st, but in the rest of the country life carried on as normal.</p> <p>It was soon clear that the problem had not been contained. On 8 March, the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, quarantined 16 million people across the north of the country, and the next day extended the lockdown to all of Italy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"da874a2da80ade88d27d5e6cc500ded7835d54bf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da874a2da80ade88d27d5e6cc500ded7835d54bf/0_0_4262_3000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Russian biological warfare troops, called in by the Italian authorities, disinfect the Pope John Paul I care home near Bergamo.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"704\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Russian biological warfare troops, called in by the Italian authorities, disinfect the Pope John Paul I care home near Bergamo.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Russian Defence Ministry/TASS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The measures saved lives, but came too late for thousands of Italians. The death toll outstripped China, and the world looked on horrified as hospitals were overwhelmed, doctors forced to choose who should have a chance on a ventilator and who should die. On 11 March, the WHO declared a global pandemic. On 14 March, Spain went into lockdown, and three days later France did the same.</p> <p>But in the UK there appeared to be greater reluctance to act decisively with lockdowns: the banning of mass gatherings and the closure of pubs and restaurants. The government\u2019s scientific and behavioural science advisers were warning ministers that the public might react badly to draconian measures and would not tolerate them for long.</p> <p>In an apparent show of defiance against the lockdowners, Johnson and Symonds attended the England v Wales rugby match at Twickenham on 7 March. The Cheltenham Festival, attended over three days to 13 March by 250,000 racegoers, was allowed to go ahead.</p> <h2>Shutdown: Johnson changes tack</h2> <p>The tone was about to change. In a Downing Street press conference on 12 March, Johnson, who had said a few days before the first UK death that the disease was \u201clikely to spread a bit more\u201d suddenly became the deliverer of grave warnings.</p> <p>Previous talk by his advisers of avoiding lockdowns and developing \u201cherd immunity\u201d had been banished and replaced by a brutal honesty. \u201cI must level with you,\u201d Johnson told reporters. \u201cMore families, many more families, are going to lose loved ones before their time.\u201d On 18 March \u2013 just days after Downing Street had suggested it was not on the cards \u2013 the government announced the closure of all schools until further noticed. Pubs and restaurants were ordered to shut on 20 March. The UK had come late into line.</p> <p>One former cabinet minister last week described the change of approach as a \u201cscreeching U-turn\u201d. Johnson and his ministers were now, even more than before, taking cover behind, and advice from, their scientific and medical advisers. Many of these advisers had become increasingly concerned that the UK had become out of step with other countries because of political resistance from ministers to measures that would hit the economy. The Observer has been told that at least two senior government advisers were on the brink of of quitting before Johnson switched his approach.</p> <p>The government has found itself unable to escape the consequences of a wider failure to prepare. As hospitals threatened to be overwhelmed before orders were given to massively expand capacity, ministers came under intense criticism over the lack of protective equipment for frontline NHS staff, over the lack of ventilators for patients in intensive care, and for a failure to test more widely for Covid-19, particularly among NHS workers.</p> <p>The lack of preparedness and instances of chaotic planning has shocked many in and outside the NHS.</p> <p>Last week, Dr Alison Pittard, the dean of the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine, the professional body for intensive care practitioners, said the minimum specifications for the government\u2019s own homegrown ventilator scheme would produce machines that would only treat patients \u201cfor a few hours\u201d. \u201cIf we had been told that that was the case\u2026 we\u2019d have said: \u2018Don\u2019t bother, you\u2019re wasting your time. That\u2019s of no use\u2019,\u201d she told the <em>Financial Times</em>.</p> <p>Last month the government missed an EU procurement deadline for ventilators because, minister said, an email went unnoticed. The NHS had said 30,000 more would be needed, Hancock reduced this to 18,000. Pittard said her faculty had been warning for years about a shortage of intensive care capacity and intensive care nurses in hospitals.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"791815c54c476190b88004cd04d9024ea7189758\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/791815c54c476190b88004cd04d9024ea7189758/0_0_3920_2751/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson and partner Carrie Symonds with the England captain Owen Farrell at Twickenham on 7 March.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"702\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson and partner Carrie Symonds with the England captain Owen Farrell at Twickenham on 7 March.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Facundo Arrizabalaga/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Normally each intensive care patient would have one intensive care nurse in attendance all the time, she said. Now there was one nurse to six patients, although other staff had been redeployed to intensive care units to plug the gaps and the new system was working because of heroic efforts. Although she was reluctant to criticise the government, she said that if the faculty had been listened to, \u201cwe wouldn\u2019t be starting from this place\u201d. Germany, she pointed out, has 29 intensive care beds per 100,000 people, compared with six in the UK.</p> <p>The Tory MP and former health minister Dan Poulter, who works part-time in the NHS, said that given the enormity of the challenge facing government \u201cit almost seems wrong to be critical\u201d.</p> <p>But he believes part of the problem is that insufficient advice has been sought from experienced NHS clinicians who would have warned of problems with PPE early on, of the shortage of ventilators and would have told ministers of the urgent need to test NHS staff.</p> <p>\u201cAn early over-reliance on academic modelling also resulted in a lack of experienced frontline NHS clinicians \u2013 in other words, the people who really understand the day-to-day challenges our hospitals and health service face \u2013 from feeding into the initial Covid-19 action plan,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has manifested itself amongst other things in the slowness of providing adequate PPE for frontline NHS staff and in the lack of virus testing for healthcare staff in the earlier part of the outbreak.\u201d</p> <h2>How the scientists reacted</h2> <p>When the investigations into the UK\u2019s response to Covid-19 come to be written, there is widespread recognition among experts that this lack of long-term strategic planning will be at the centre of it. So too should be the need to ensure that the views of experts are fed into government more efficiently and widely. The prospect of a previously unknown disease spreading catastrophically around the globe and infecting millions is, after all, not a new one.</p> <p>Indeed, many warnings have been given in the past about the viral dangers facing humanity. \u201cGiven the continual emergence of new pathogens ... and the ever-increasing connectedness of our world, there is a significant probability that a large and lethal pandemic will occur in our lifetime,\u201d Bill Gates predicted several years ago. \u201cAnd it will have the impact of a nuclear war,\u201d he warned, while urging nations to start stockpiling antiviral drugs and therapies. If only.</p> <p>For its part, the WHO prepared \u2013 several years ago \u2013 a list of viruses with no known treatments or vaccines, illnesses that could one day trigger that pandemic and kill hundreds of thousands. Prospective killers included nipah disease and lassa fever as well as an ailment it simply called \u201cdisease X\u201d \u2013 \u201ca serious international epidemic caused by a pathogen currently unknown\u201d.</p> <p>As to the most likely nature of that mysterious virus, most modelling assumed that disease X would be flu-like in behaviour, says Dr Josie Golding, the epidemics lead at the Wellcome Trust. After all, influenza had caused so many deadly global outbreaks in the past. As a result, a lot of investment went into making influenza vaccines in preparation, she says. \u201cBut have we been thinking about diseases other than influenza that might become pandemics? I don\u2019t think we have. There has been a real gap in our thinking.\u201d</p> <p>Then came the appearance of Covid-19 \u2013 caused not by a strain of influenza but by a coronavirus \u2013 in November. Initially, only a few cases were highlighted, a trend that began to change early this year with a rise in numbers of infected ill people.</p> <p>\u201cThe report that really grabbed my attention came out in mid-January,\u201d says epidemiologist Professor Mark Woolhouse at Edinburgh University. \u201cIt said 41 cases of this new respiratory illness had now been diagnosed in one small area of China, around Wuhan. And that set the alarm bells ringing for me.\u201d</p> <p>For Woolhouse, the cluster of cases in one place showed this was not a matter of a few people scattered around China picking up an occasional infection from an animal such as a bat or a chicken. \u201cForty-one cases in one small area at the same time could not be explained that way. People are not picking this up from animals, I realised. They are actually spreading it to each other. It was already heading out of control.\u201d</p> <p>Ewan Birney, head of the Cambridgeshire-based European Bioinformatics Institute, part of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory network, also noted the significance of the new disease at the time. \u201cI presumed, at first, that this one would also burn itself out, probably somewhere in Asia,\u201d he says.</p> <p>His reasoning was straightforward. The outbreak of Sars that appeared in 2003 in China was caused by a coronavirus and killed more than 10% of those it infected. \u201cIn fact, it killed or hospitalised so many of those it infected the chain of transmission from one person to others was cut. It was too lethal for its own good. So I thought this might happen with this new disease. But it turns out Covid-19 is much milder and incapacitates fewer individuals, so there is no cut in its transmission. When that became apparent \u2013 around mid-January \u2013 I became very worried.\u201d</p> <p>Then there was the infectiousness of the new virus. A person with Sars generally starts to display symptoms before they infect other people. That makes it much easier to contain. But this was not the case with Covid-19. Early data from China \u2013 again released in January \u2013 showed the virus was being spread from people who were displaying only the mildest symptoms, or in some cases no symptoms. This was making the condition very difficult to track, says virologist Professor Jonathan Ball of Nottingham University.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"25977647596285090437cf9f7a40c96f7d171dab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25977647596285090437cf9f7a40c96f7d171dab/0_0_6048_4024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The County Oak Medical Centre in Brighton was closed on February 10 after a member of staff was infected with coronavirus.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The County Oak Medical Centre in Brighton was closed on 10 February after a member of staff was infected with coronavirus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Glyn Kirk/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAt that point I realised this outbreak was going to be very serious,\u201d he added. \u201cI sent a tweet to a colleague in Australia.

He sent one back agreeing with me.\u201d</p> <p>Around this time, Paul Nurse, Nobel laureate and head of the Francis Crick Institute, recalls attending a conference where he met Mark Walport, head of UK Research and Innovation, the organisation that funds a vast slice of British scientific research.</p> <p>\u201cHe had just received a text message from a colleague about the outbreak and we started to discuss the implications,\u201d Nurse recalls. \u201cIt did not take us long for us both to realise this was going to be very significant. It took another two or three weeks to confirm these worst fears \u2013 by mid-February.\u201d</p> <p>By this time, Birney had realised the virus had a real sting in its tail and could cause serious illness among the elderly and those with other underlying serious ailments. \u201cIt was half-term and I was on holiday with my parents. All I wanted to do was to get the holiday over and then get them back to their house in the country where they could keep themselves isolated.\u201d</p> <p>In February, sporadic cases of Covid-19 were appearing round the country, recalls Tom Wingfield, a clinician and infectious disease expert based at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. \u201cThese were cases that had been brought into the country, mainly from China or Italy. Then there was an outbreak in Brighton [and a number of other cases without foreign travel] and I realised that the virus had established itself in a community there. It was a turning point.\u201d</p> <p>Britain was still doing quite well in containing the disease by testing, tracing contact and setting up quarantine for those suspected of being infected with Covid-19 at this time. \u201cThen, in March, the government decided to abandon this approach and shift from containing the disease to delaying its progress,\u201d says Wingfield. \u201cI would really like to know why the decision to give up testing and contact tracing was taken.\u201d</p> <p>Many other researchers also question why the government took so long to react to their warnings. \u201cPart of the trouble was there were other virologists who were saying this was going to be like Sars or flu and there was not too much to worry about,\u201d says Ball. \u201cBut Sars happened in 2003. The world is much more connected now than it was then. More to the point, Covid-19 was also much more infectious than Sars. And so it started appearing in lots of other countries.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Perhaps some of us should have got up in front of BBC News and said you lot ought to be petrified because this is going to be a pandemic that will kill hundreds of thousands of people</p> <footer> <cite>Professor Jonathan Ball</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cPerhaps some of us should have got up in front of BBC News and said you lot ought to be petrified because this is going to be a pandemic that will kill hundreds of thousands of people,\u201d adds Ball. \u201cNone of us thought this was a particularly constructive thing to do, but maybe with hindsight we should have. If there had been more voices, maybe politicians would have taken this a bit more seriously.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere is no question that we were insufficiently prepared,\u201d Nurse says. \u201cWe had been warned a few years ago when reports made it clear that the UK was not ready to combat a major flu pandemic and we did not take up that warning. As a result, we were caught out.\u201d</p> <p>He and many others say an inquiry into Britain\u2019s Covid-19 preparedness will have to be held at some point but stress that this should not be started until the crisis has been dealt with in the UK.</p> <p>Professor Ian Boyd, a former chief scientific adviser at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, agrees. \u201cThere is a great danger there will be a lot of looking back with the benefits of hindsight and poking fingers of blame,\u201d warns Boyd. \u201cBut when you are in the middle of things you have to make a lot of very hard 50-50 decisions, and sometimes you make the wrong call. On the other hand, there is no harm in making sure that we learn as many lessons as we can.\u201d</p> <h2>The lessons from the rest of the world \u2026</h2> <p>Boris Johnson, after his own brush with death at the hands of Covid-19, will presumably no longer take the gung-ho attitude to illness that he has always has. A former Tory minister said: \u201cIf Boris had any sense he would take control of the inquiry and lead it.\u201d</p> <p>One conclusion that experts are already drawing is that it was those countries close to China, with memories of Sars, or cultural ties to their neighbour, which were much faster to act in response to Covid-19. Perhaps most notable in its success was Taiwan. Closely linked by economic and cultural ties to mainland China, Taiwan could have been at high risk of a major Covid-19 epidemic. Tourists and business people travelled regularly back and forth.</p> <p>But helped perhaps by having an epidemiologist as vice-president, the government set up a gold standard regime of testing and contact tracing that means that nearly three months on from its first confirmed infection, it has registered fewer than 400 cases and six deaths.</p> <p>Taiwan\u2019s extensive testing and thorough contact tracing are precisely the kind of action that the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt is demanding before the UK lockdown is lifted. Hunt points out that it is one of the essential conditions set by the WHO to avoid a second wave resulting from an easing of restrictions.</p> <p>Hong Kong, which also suffered from the Sars crisis, also moved early to enforce quarantine and social distancing, as well as widespread mask wearing, and today has registered just over 1,000 cases and only four deaths.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9f289aa48517f17149a8041ae814acba0d3acdc0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f289aa48517f17149a8041ae814acba0d3acdc0/0_0_2677_1785/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A man in Wuhan on February 10, the 19th day of the transport lockdown.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man in Wuhan on 10 February, the 19th day of the transport lockdown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In late February, South Korea looked like it was on a trajectory to disaster, with the highest number of confirmed cases outside China, and numbers rising rapidly. But after the country\u2019s first infection, the government met medical companies and urged them to start developing coronavirus test kits on a massive scale.</p> <p>The results were impressive. When the epidemic hit, it was ready to deploy largescale testing. Its measures allowed South Korea to become <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/world/asia/coronavirus-south-korea-flatten-curve.html\">the second country to flatten its coronavirus curve</a>, without the sweeping shutdowns of society and economic activity that China had pioneered and the west would be forced to adopt.</p> <p>China\u2019s experience should have provided a grim template for western countries to use to prepare. The speed with which Wuhan\u2019s crisis had intensified showed that a relatively advanced medical system could be swamped. Within three weeks there were over 64,000 people infected and 1,000 dead.</p> <p>The pleas for help from Wuhan\u2019s residents and doctors were to be echoed by those from Italy a few weeks later, and soon after the UK.</p> <p>Look back three months, and in China there were not enough tests to work out who had coronavirus, there was not enough protective equipment for medical staff treating patients, and then, soon, tragically there were not enough hospital beds and ventilators for sick patients. These are exactly the challenges faced by authorities from New York to Rome, London to Madrid.</p> <h2>\u2026 and the other country that didn\u2019t listen</h2> <p>If the UK has serious questions to answer, the country that so far has seen the worst of the outbreak, the United States, was slowest of all to act. Trump for months ignored, played down or lied about the threat posed by coronavirus, leaving individual states to act unilaterally as it became clear it had already taken hold on US soil.</p> <p>On 17 March parts of California issued \u201cshelter in place\u201d orders, effectively a lockdown. By the end of that week New York City had also shut down, along with a dozen states, and the majority of the rest of the country had put <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-state-by-state-guide-to-coronavirus-lockdowns-11584749351?mod=theme_coronavirus-ribbon\">some restrictions in place</a>. Only five states had few or no controls.</p> <p>There have now been nearly 700,000 confirmed cases in the US and over 33,000 deaths; actual numbers are likely to be higher for both. The economy has also been devastated, with more than 22 million out of work as businesses collapse or shrink under the strain.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"69e38a47cdc18de7145f38e0be39c788201f5258\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/69e38a47cdc18de7145f38e0be39c788201f5258/0_0_3708_2472/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The US was slowest of all to act, but Donald Trump is ready to lift restrictions already.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The US was slowest of all to act, but Donald Trump is preparing to lift restrictions already.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Brandon/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Trump insists the US is turning a corner, and has tried to blame \u2013 among other targets \u2013 the WHO for failing to fully raise the alarm, and has stripped it of its US funding.</p> <p>There have certainly been questions about the organisation\u2019s strong praise for China and the exclusion of Taiwan, which may have contributed to the delay in recognising human-to-human transmission was occurring.

I\u2019ve seen a version of this movie before and at the end the president wins. His name was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/hugo-chavez\">Hugo Chavez</a>.</p> <p>Venezuela\u2019s mercurial leader died in 2013 but set a template that Trump has successfully followed since running for the Republican nomination in 2016.</p> <p>Bluster, distraction, polarisation and patronage go a long way when fused with shrewd electoral calculation. It put Trump in the White House and could give him another term. Little matter if the path is strewn with policy fiascos.</p> <p>During his 14-year rule, Chavez presided over economic dysfunction, managerial chaos and creeping authoritarianism. He died before Venezuela\u2019s economic collapse but left the country hollowed and riven by violent crime so frightening people stayed indoors at night, a de facto lockdown.</p> <p>He also picked fights with state governors, the media and multinational organisations, propagated conspiracy theories \u2013 Nasa faked the moon landings, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/29/hugo-chavez-us-cancer-plot\">the CIA infected leftwing leaders with cancer</a> \u2013 and proclaimed a \u201cmiracle\u201d cure for his own terminal illness. He won election after election.</p> <p>It helped that he was able to bully opponents, abuse electoral rules, exploit state patronage and harness sycophantic TV channels, with Mario Silva, presenter of a show called the Razorblade, acting as his Sean Hannity.</p> <p>Comparisons with the US have limits.

Each calculated, correctly, that electoral arithmetic made polarisation a winning strategy.</p> <p>They deployed humor, insults and vulgarity to rupture protocol and connect with supporters on a gut level. Ch\u00e1vez branded opponents \u201cassholes\u201d, Trump called them \u201cpussies\u201d. Ch\u00e1vez leered at a camera to tell his then wife, \u201cMarisabel, you\u2019re going to get yours tonight\u201d. Trump bragged about penis size.</p> <p>There was genius to it. Suck up the oxygen and leave rivals gasping for air. Thunder and dazzle, shock and provoke. Dominate.</p> <p>Four years later Trump is the incumbent with a record to defend, but like Ch\u00e1vez he still plays the insurgent, the people\u2019s champion who is beset by nefarious forces (deep state, oligarchs, saboteurs, leakers) and must hit back to defend himself and, by extension, the popular will.</p> <p>\u201cWhen somebody is the president of the United States, the authority is total,\u201d Trump said last week. Ch\u00e1vez was equally blunt: \u201cI am not an individual, I am the people. It\u2019s my duty to demand respect for the people.\u201d</p> <p>I wondered in 2016 if Trump would be as deft as Ch\u00e1vez in consolidating power and turning crises to his advantage. Mostly, he has.</p> <p>He has appointed close to 200 federal judges, moulded the GOP in his image, subverted government agencies and hijacked investigations. He has admitted that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/14/trump-cant-cancel-the-election-but-he-will-try-to-stop-people-voting\">voter suppression</a> benefits Republicans and shrugged off the outcry.

In speeches and press conferences the comandante would zig-zag from economic policy to tirades about opponents, reminiscences about his army days, praise for his daughter, an anecdote about foreign leaders and back to economic policy. He was narcissistic and prolix, speaking up to seven, eight, nine hours straight.</p> <p>But he avoided certain topics, notably crime, a violent pandemic his administration failed to tame. So he kept shtum. Morgues would fill, and he\u2019d say nothing. He refused to own the problem.

The two men appear to share little by way of philosophy, but each night they share a stage in front of a scared nation in the grip of a terrifying pandemic; a nation looking to these two very different men to save it from further disaster.</p> <p>For Fauci, 79, facing down this coronavirus is a date with destiny he has been working his entire life toward. For Trump, 73, the coronavirus is a rare brush with accountability, a moment when boasts and threats and lies do not work.</p> <p>To achieve success according to their respective definitions of the word, the two men need each other. Trump needs Fauci to shore up fading public trust in his administration\u2019s disaster response. Fauci needs Trump to take action that saves lives.</p> <p>Their purposes have been mostly \u2013 though not always \u2013 well aligned. But the rise of an anti-Fauci movement on the political right \u2013 and the president\u2019s frequent intolerance for being overshadowed \u2013 have fueled concerns that for all its practical necessity, and the stakes for the nation, the Fauci-Trump partnership could come to pieces.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Tony was just a master at relationships</p> <footer> <cite>Derek Hodel, worked with Fauci in the 1990s</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If that happens, said Derek Hodel, a senior program adviser at Physicians for Human Rights who worked with Fauci as an Aids activist and advocate in the 1990s, it would be a rare defeat for Fauci\u2019s political skills.</p> <p>\u201cTony was just a master at relationships,\u201d Hodel said. \u201cThis is his sixth administration, and although the dynamics of the Trump administration are louder and crazier than any other administration, they\u2019re not all of them different.\u201d</p> <p>After graduating at the top of his class from Cornell medical school in the Vietnam war era, Fauci fulfilled a public health service requirement by taking a researcher post at NIAID, where he became director in 1984.

He predicted that had he not been elected, the world might have ended.</p> <p>And somewhere along the way, he talked about the coronavirus.</p> <p>The past few weeks have seen a battle between Donald Trump, the president, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/24/donald-trump-coronavirus-briefings-2020-campaign-rallies\">Donald Trump, the candidate.</a> He has always been more comfortable in campaign mode and, slowly but surely, Trump the candidate is winning the struggle. Saturday was one of those days.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s called the James S Brady briefing room, not the James S Brady rally room, but today it was hard to tell the difference,\u201d Robert Gibbs, a former White House press secretary, told the MSNBC network.</p> <p>I was among an unlucky 13 reporters sitting in that room on Saturday, along with one standing at the back from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/jun/15/oan-oann-fox-news-donald-trump\">Trump\u2019s beloved One America News Network</a> which, having flouted reporters\u2019 agreed physical distancing guidelines, is there at the invitation of the White House.</p> <p>Laptops on knees, with several seats between us to maintain physical distancing, we were hardly a typical Make America Great Again crowd. But tellingly, while there was no sign of Dr Anthony Fauci\u2019s reassuring presence, the seats to Trump\u2019s right included Mark Meadows, a vocal ally in Congress recently appointed White House chief of staff, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/08/kayleigh-mcenany-donald-trump-press-secretary-quotes\">Kayleigh McEnany,</a> the Trump 2020 campaign national spokesperson turned White House press secretary.</p> <p>Both gazed up at their boss reverently and smiled at his jokes.<strong> </strong>Meanwhile Dr Deborah Birx, response coordinator on the coronavirus taskforce, stood on the podium and spent long periods staring expressionless into the middle distance as Trump reeled off some golden oldies.</p> <p>\u201cWe had the best economy in the history of the world, better than China, better than any country in the world, better than any country\u2019s ever had,\u201d he said, waving his hand at what was ostensibly a coronavirus taskforce briefing. \u201cWe had the highest stock market in history by far, and I\u2019m honoured by the fact it\u2019s started to go up very substantially.\u201d</p> <p>Wearing a blue suit, white shirt and red tie, Trump added: \u201cWe have a big election coming up but I think we have tremendous momentum. First we get rid of the plague.\u201d</p> <p>Across the country, the Trump movement is stirring again. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/18/stay-at-home-order-protest-lockdown-maryland-texas-ohio\">Protests against the \u201ctyranny\u201d of lockdown measures</a> have featured Trump campaign regalia, Confederate flags, guns and placards such as \u201cSocial distancing = communism\u201d. The Trump adviser Stephen Moore has compared the protesters to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/04/rosa-parks-exhibition-civil-rights-library-of-congress#maincontent\">Rosa Parks,</a> the civil rights activist arrested for refusing to surrender her seat on a crowded bus to a white passenger in Montgomery, Alabama, in 1955.</p> <p>What did Trump think of that? \u201cWell, there is a lot of injustice. When you look at Virginia, where they want to take your guns away, they want to violate your second amendment ... I just think some of the governors have gotten carried away \u2026 It\u2019s a strong statement but I can see where he\u2019s coming from.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/18/stay-at-home-order-protest-lockdown-maryland-texas-ohio\">Protesters decry stay-at-home orders in Maryland, Texas and Ohio capitals</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As at a rally, he hymned the praise of his vice-president, Mike Pence, then went after Democratic senators who were on a call to Pence on Friday as \u201crude and nasty\u201d, adding: \u201cAll you have to do is look at the big V for victory, or V for ventilator. Take a look at it. Everybody said they had us on that. They thought they had us but we got \u2019em done in numbers that nobody would believe.\u201d</p> <p>The comment suggested Trump viewed the race for ventilators as a political trap that he had managed to avoid, not a humanitarian emergency. But Democrats are also concerned about Trump\u2019s you\u2019re-on-your-own message to states when it comes to testing. He complained: \u201cYou hear so much about testing. What we\u2019ve done has been incredible on testing.\u201d And in a swipe at Barack Obama: \u201cI inherited broken junk.\u201d</p> <p>No Trump rally is complete without him playing the victim \u2013 one sure to prevail heroically in the final act \u2013 and goading the media, usually a cue for his supporters to turn and and jeer the press pen. This time the president took aim at a reporter who was not in the room: Maggie Haberman of the New York Times.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s a third-rate reporter,\u201d he lamented, going on a long riff to make the baseless allegation that a Haberman story, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/16/us/politics/trump-mark-meadows-chief-of-staff.html\">which said Meadows had cried during meetings with White House staff,</a> was motivated by \u201cretribution\u201d. Trump insisted: \u201cHe\u2019s not a cryer.\u201d</p> <p>Extraordinarily, the president of the United States spent more time on this personal grievance against a journalist with whom he has a long history than on the unimaginable scale of death and grief across the nation. On the eve of the 25th anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing, it was quite a contrast from the days when Bill Clinton was hailed the \u201cconsoler-in-chief\u201d.</p> <p>When Birx finally got her turn, she praised \u201cthe amazing work of the American people\u201d, particularly in cities such as Detroit, to observe social distancing. But when she pointed to a graphic of international comparisons on screens behind the podium, Trump could not resist butting in and pointing to China\u2019s claim of 0.33 deaths per 100,000 people (America\u2019s is 11.24, the UK\u2019s is 21.97). \u201cExcuse me, does anybody really believe this number?\u201d he demanded, later asking the same about Iran.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/18/operation-reopen-america-are-we-about-to-witness-a-second-historic-failure-of-leadership-from-trump\">Operation reopen America: are we about to witness a second historic failure of leadership from Trump?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was another cudgel with which to beat the media. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you people figure that out, though?\u201d he demanded. Unfortunately for Trump, the Biden campaign had just released a video stating: \u201cWhen Trump rolled over for the Chinese, he took their word for it. Trump praised the Chinese 15 times in January and February as the coronavirus spread across the world.\u201d</p> <p>The president ended the briefing-cum-rally as he began, talking about anything but the coronavirus. He attacked the Democratic congresswomen Ilhan Omar and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez as having a \u201cvery strong anti-Israel bent\u201d. He said of North Korea: \u201cLook, if I wasn\u2019t elected, you would right now \u2013 maybe the world \u2013 would be over.\u201d</p> <p>He added falsely, for good measure: \u201cWhen I first came in, we didn\u2019t have ammunition, not a good way to fight a war. President Obama left us no ammunition.\u201d He declared that no one had been tougher on Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin than he has been and recycled old gripes about the Iran nuclear deal and Chinese tariffs.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe Sleepy Joe Biden\u2019s gonna win,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if Sleepy Joe Biden wins you\u2019ll own the United States. And China will own the United States.\u201d</p> <p>With mendacity and menace, the 2020 election campaign was back under way. The president is eager to become a candidate again and move on. With nearly 40,000 Americans dead from the virus, perhaps no one should be surprised.</p>"
