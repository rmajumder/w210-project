There should be a more consultative mechanisms where states sit together. There needs to be cooperation. There should be a blueprint for working together.

All countries in the region are affected and under lockdowns of varying degrees, with international travel suspended and movement increasingly prohibited. <strong>Ivory Coast</strong> has the highest number of confirmed cases at 654. </p> \n  <p>Yet, across west Africa testing is very limited, with <strong>Ghana</strong> testing about 35,000 people so far and Nigeria only about 5,000. In Lagos, authorities have just begun the first community testing to determine the spread in the wider population, as so far tests have only been conducted on people who have recently travelled into the country or who have alerted authorities to their condition. </p> \n  <p><strong>Nigeria</strong>\u2019s government is racing to strengthen a chronically underfunded health system, with only a few hundred ICUs and ventilators for its 200 million people, according to medical unions. Nigeria spends 4% of GDP on health, which is among the lowest levels in percentage terms in Africa. <br><br>Nigeria already has an oxygen crisis, with 625,000 people dying each year due to hospitals not having enough oxygen provision. In recent weeks, strikes by doctors have further highlighted the difficulties in health services, amid complaints of unpaid salaries and poor working conditions.<br><br>The number of laboratories testing for Covid-19 are being quickly expanded and health centres built with help from the private sector. But there remain fears that even a moderate outbreak could overwhelm the system unless much more is done. </p> \n  <p>The financial toll of the lockdowns on the poor in west Africa is already becoming clear, with videos across social media of citizens pleading for food supplies and money. Lockdowns have been widespread but help is incredibly limited. <strong>Ghana</strong> has been among the more proactive countries, yet most are struggling to provide adequate supplies to more than a fraction of the people affected. <br><br>In <strong>Senegal</strong>, there are fears that more than 100,000 street children, known locally as Talib\u00e9s, who beg on the streets are at a greater risk of contracting the coronavirus. Many are homeless or living in squalid, congested Islamic boarding schools. Senegalese authorities say they are trying to help by providing education centres for 1,500 children. <br><br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-16T10:20:20.160Z\">at 11.20am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e982a158f08cf571cdb2071\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-16T09:53:31.483Z\">10.53am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Europe still in the midst of the Covid-19 storm, World Health Organization warns</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/16/coronavirus-live-news-cases-worldwide-top-2-million-trump-doubts-china-death-toll?page=with:block-5e9823398f08ea7431f43ce7#block-5e9823398f08ea7431f43ce7\">More from the World Health Organization press briefing</a>, as the body\u2019s European regional director warns that the continent is still in the midst of the storm of the Covid-19 pandemic, with the number of cases nearing a million.</p> \n  <p>\u201cAs of today, Europe remains very much at the centre of the pandemic.

Maybe. <br></p> \n  <p>The US is now firmly entrenched at the center of the global coronavirus outbreak, with more than 600,000 people confirmed as being infected by Covid-19 and more than 30,000 losing their lives due to the virus.</p> \n  <p>There are hopes that the US is starting to hit a peak in terms of new infections, followed by a long plateau and then drop, which will open the way to a gradual restart of normal life such as the opening of schools and businesses.<br></p> \n  <p>Anthony Fauci, the federal government\u2019s top infectious diseases expert, has expressed \u201ccautious optimism\u201d that hospitalizations from the virus have started to slow down, although the rise in deaths will lag behind. \u201cOnce you turn that corner, hopefully we\u2019ll see a very sharp decline,\u201d Fauci said. On 13 April Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told NBC that \u201cwe are nearing the peak right now.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>A model relied upon by the White House, from the University of Washington, estimates that the virus will \u201cpeter out\u201d in May and then essentially grind to a halt by the summer. This is based on the experiences of China and Italy, previous coronavirus hotspots.<br></p> \n  <p>But this model, like all predictions, is dynamic and depends upon the application of measures such as social distancing to slow the rate of transmission. Other forecasts have been more pessimistic, warning that it will be difficult to tame the spread of the virus until well after summer. Premature relaxation of restrictions on gatherings of people could see a second, much more severe, increase in infections. <br></p> \n  <p>The sheer size of the US, as well as its large population, means that there will be several \u2018peaks\u2019 at different times across the country. While the situation may be starting to stabilize somewhat in New York, areas in the heart of the country have yet to see the worst of the virus.\u201dThat is going to be confusing for people,\u201d said Doug Burgum, governor of North Dakota. \u201cIf wow, New York had all these deaths and they are opening up, why aren\u2019t we opening?

Immediately after the hour-long conference call, a spokesman for Angela Merkel said that the German chancellor had argued that \u201cthe pandemic can only be overcome with a strong and co-ordinated international response\u201d. The spokesman said Merkel \u201cexpressed support for the WHO as well as a number of other partners\u201d. </p> <p>The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said: \u201cThere is a need for international coordination and the WHO is an important part of that collaboration and coordination. We recognise that there have been questions asked, but at the same time it is really important we stay coordinated as we move through this.\u201d</p> <p>The Gates Foundation also announced an extra $150m (\u00a3120m) donation, in a move the WHO welcomed.</p> <p>The White House insisted there was support for US criticism of the WHO in the G7 call, saying \u201cmuch of the conversation centred on the lack of transparency and chronic mismanagement of the pandemic by the WHO. The leaders called for a thorough review and reform process.\u201d</p> <p>The US is the largest donor to the WHO, providing about $400m annually, but it claims that the WHO director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, was unwilling to confront the Chinese at the start of the outbreak.</p> <p>Trump \u2013 in a battle to save his presidency this November, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/12/us-global-reputation-rock-bottom-donald-trump-coronavirus\">under fire over the lack of US leadership during the crisis</a> \u2013 is widely seen to be eager to turn the pandemic into a trial of strength and influence with China.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/12/us-global-reputation-rock-bottom-donald-trump-coronavirus\">US's global  reputation hits rock-bottom over Trump's coronavirus response</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Other G7 leaders harbour doubts about aspects of the WHO\u2019s role and China\u2019s response to the coronavirus, but argue that the middle of the coronavirus pandemic is the wrong moment to disrupt the organisation\u2019s leadership by blowing a surprise hole in its finances.</p> <p>With the US acting as the current chair of the G7, and facing criticism of America\u2019s global leadership, Trump had convened the special meeting of the G7 leaders, a grouping of mainly western leading economies that, unlike the larger G20, excludes both Russia and China.</p> <p>The UK was represented on the call by the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, who is still standing in for Boris Johnson as the prime minister recovers from coronavirus.</p> <p>He said once the outbreak is controlled \u201cwe cannot have business as usual and must ask the hard questions about how it came about\u201d. He added: \u201cThere needs to be a very deep dive and review of the lessons including the outbreak of the virus.\u201d</p> <p>But he called for a balanced review stressing \u201cthis should be driven by the science\u201d.</p> <p>The UK this month increased its aid to the WHO, and its officials recognise that the WHO was involved in a delicate diplomatic effort to win Chinese permission to enter the country to investigate the outbreak.</p> <p>In a statement after the summit, the EU council president, Charles Michel, called on world leaders to contribute to an international online pledging conference on 4 May to \u201cenhance general preparedness and ensure adequate funding to develop and deploy a vaccine against coronavirus\u201d.</p> <p>The EU conference could help fill the hole created by the US suspension of funding. The EU says it is trying to raise as much as $8bn, but it is not clear how the EU conference will work alongside UN calls for extra money for the WHO.</p> <p>The EU statement also sent a shot across Trump\u2019s bows by stressing \u201cmultilateralism should be at the core of the action\u201d. The EU also stressed that its pledging conference should be devoted to building African resilience, a theme that the French president, Emmanuel Macron, stressed at the G7 conference.</p> <p>In a separate video conference with international counterparts, Germany\u2019s foreign minister, Heiko Maas, described the WHO as the \u201cbackbone of the fight against the pandemic\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt makes no sense now to question the ability of the WHO to function or its significance,\u201d he said.</p> <p>G7 finance ministers agreed limited debt relief for low-income countries, in a sign of concern that the epidemic could play havoc with the economies of developing countries. But the G7 aid was for a year and limited to interest, as opposed to the principal. The help is conditional on wider support for the measure from the G20. The G20 has been discussing a debt suspension plan covering about $18bn of payments.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/29/us-awol-from-world-stage-as-china-tries-on-global-leadership-for-size\">US awol from world stage as China tries on global leadership for size</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trump has already had one falling-out with the other six G7 leaders when they refused to accept a previous US-drafted communique for a meeting on 16 March.</p> <p>The US wanted the 16 March G7 communique to describe coronavirus as the Wuhan virus in a bid to pin China with responsibility for the coming global economic recession.

  "<p>Tributes have been paid to Joe Brown, the British climber regarded as an outstanding pioneer, who has died aged 89.</p> <p>The mountaineer, whose extraordinary skill and dexterity earned him nicknames such as \u201cthe Master\u201d and the \u201chuman fly\u201d, died peacefully at home in Llanberis, Wales, having been ill for some time.</p> <p>Most active in the 1950s and 60s, Brown established a number of new routes in Snowdonia and the Peak District, which were at the leading edge of the hard grades.</p> <p>In 1955, aged 24, he and fellow climber George Band made history after scaling Kanchenjunga\u2019s south-west face, one of the Himalayas\u2019 most difficult peaks, and the third highest mountain in the world. In 1956, he made the first ascent of the west summit of the Muztagh Tower in the Karakoram mountain range.</p> <p>Born in Manchester, he trained as an apprentice plumber and general builder, and together with his early climbing partner, Don Whillans, was among a new breed of post-war climbers from working-class backgrounds.</p> <p>He was well known for his televised rock climbs in the 1960s, including scaling the Old Man of Hoy, a Scottish sea stack, in 1967 with Ian McNaught-Davis and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/oct/14/chris-bonington-mountaineer-everest-ascent-british-climber-book-interview\">Chris Bonington</a>.</p> <p>Brown moved to Llanberis, where he opened a climbing shop in 1966, which became one of three. He contributed to new types of climbing protection by creating some of the first \u201cnuts\u201d by drilling out the thread of the nuts and putting a sling through the centre.</p> <p>He was made a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/dec/31/new-year-honours-sports\">CBE in the 2011 New Year honours</a> for services to rock climbing and mountaineering.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mtn_heritage/status/1250745772712361984\">Mountain Heritage Trust</a> said: \u201cWe are deeply saddened to learn that Joe Brown has passed away.

But while some companies will see robust demand, the overall impact will be negative.<br></p> <p>She explains:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>An important aspect of the economic effects of Covid-19 is that they will be highly asymmetric. Firms that relied on social interaction or non-essential visits have had to close down temporarily, while others that can offer services remotely or by delivery have been less directly affected. Recent analyses have highlighted the different ways spending might be affected in sectors that can remain open.</p> <p>On the one hand, firms that offer substitute products will see demand increase: for example, purchases of food from supermarkets instead of cafes and restaurants; or streaming of films or television in place of cinema trips or live entertainment. But on the other hand, all sectors will suffer from falls in demand owing to lower income and increased uncertainty elsewhere in the economy. In my view, the latter effect is likely to dominate. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>So what is the Bank of England doing about it?</strong> Tenreyro, a member of the monetary policy committee, explains they have cut interest rates to record lows, launched a new scheme to encouraging lending, and announced another \u00a3200bn of QE.</p> <p>That could help the economy recover, she hopes.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A crucial aspect is that much of its economic impact should ultimately prove temporary: many businesses that were viable and jobs that were needed before Covid-19 will be so again after it passes.</p> <p>A key task for policy in the interim is to try to minimise those business failures and reduce job losses that would otherwise lead to persistent scarring effects.

  "<p>Barclays chief executive Jes Staley will avoid a potentially embarrassing vote against his re-election over his ties to the sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, after activist investor Ed Bramson eased up on demands for his removal in light of the Covid-19 outbreak.</p> <p>Bramson<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/02/barclays-investor-calls-for-boss-jes-staley-removal-over-epstein-links\"> called for Staley\u2019s removal last month</a> but on Thursday, he admitted the bank would need more time to replace the chief executive as it tried to deal with more pressing challenges posed by the pandemic.</p> <p>Bramson, whose Sherborne Investors vehicle owns a stake of more than 5% in Barclays, said he was calling on Barclays shareholders to abstain from the vote, which is due before the bank\u2019s annual general meeting on 7 May. It is expected to take place via webcast due to physical distancing rules.</p> <p>A letter sent by Bramson to Barclays shareholders said: \u201cWe continue to believe that Mr Staley has not demonstrated the level of judgment befitting a director or senior executive of the company.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, as a result of engagement with Barclays and in recognition of the complexity of the management situation presented during the Covid-19 pandemic, we will now, with great reluctance, only withhold our vote for Mr Staley\u2019s reappointment at the 2020 AGM, rather than vote against him.\u201d</p> <p>Bramson said fellow shareholders should push the Barclays board for a succession timetable. He added that Staley\u2019s eventual departure \u201cwould bring to an end what has now degenerated into a series of public spectacles\u201d.</p> <p>UK regulators are investigating whether Staley was sufficiently transparent about his relationship with Epstein, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/10/jeffrey-epstein-dead-prison-report-latest\">died in prison</a> in August 2019 while awaiting trial on charges of trafficking underage girls.</p> <p>Staley, who joined <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/barclay\">Barclays</a> in 2015, has said he developed a relationship with Epstein in 2000 when he became the boss of JP Morgan\u2019s private bank, which counted Epstein among its wealthy customers. The Barclays boss said his relationship with Espstein tapered off after he left JP Morgan in 2013. He made a final visit to Epstein\u2019s private Caribbean island with his wife in the final months of 2015.</p> <p>The Epstein investigation comes less than two years after Staley was fined almost \u00a3650,000 for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/may/11/barclays-jes-staley-fined-whistleblower-fca\">attempting to unmask a whistleblower</a> at Barclays in 2016.</p> <p>Barclays is backing its chief executive and said Staley \u201cretains the full confidence of the board, and is being unanimously recommended for re-election\u201d at the AGM.

  "<p>Israel\u2019s opposition leader, Benny Gantz, has failed to form a coalition government after talks with Benjamin Netanyahu stalled, pushing the country further towards an unprecedented fourth round of elections.</p> <p>Gantz had until midnight on Wednesday to build a majority government and now loses the mandate given to him by the president, Reuven Rivlin.</p> <p>His failure does not automatically trigger fresh elections. Before that occurs, there will be a 21-day period in which the Knesset, Israel\u2019s parliament, can vote to nominate any candidate to be prime minister.</p> <p>\u201cI hope that the Knesset members will be able to form a majority in such a way that a government can be formed as soon as possible, and to prevent a fourth round of elections,\u201d Rivlin wrote in a letter to Gantz on Thursday.</p> <p>Netanyahu and Gantz may continue negotiations to join forces during that time, as together they could probably muster enough votes for a coalition. The pair have been discussing power-sharing options in which they would take it in turns to be prime minister over a four-year term.</p> <p>Netanyahu\u2019s Likud and Gantz\u2019s Blue and White said their negotiating teams would hold further talks on Thursday, and the two leaders may meet again in the evening.</p> <p>It will not be easy to reach a deal. During the past year, the two rivals have battled through <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/israels-opposition-head-benny-gantz-wins-support-to-form-government\">three inconclusive national votes</a>. In that time, they have also made multiple failed attempts to forge a unity government.</p> <p>Faced with the coronavirus pandemic, both have expressed a desire to come to an understanding.</p> <p>Gantz took a significant risk in restarting talks with Netanyahu after so much distrust has built up during the year-long political crisis.</p> <p>Over the course of three elections, the former army chief had promised his supporters that he would oust Netanyahu, and when he decided not to do so last month, he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/benny-gantz-elected-israeli-speaker-signalling-deal-with-netanyahu\">lost </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/benny-gantz-elected-israeli-speaker-signalling-deal-with-netanyahu\">more than half</a> of his vehemently anti-Netanyahu Blue and White legislators.</p> <p>Blue and White had wanted to introduce term limits for prime ministers, and a ban on them serving while under indictment. Either restriction would have ended Netanyahu\u2019s political career. Israel\u2019s longest-serving leader is fighting three major corruption cases.

Their true feelings are only revealed when their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/dec/04/footage-appears-to-show-world-leaders-joking-about-trump-at-nato-summit\">private conversations</a> are accidentally overheard. This time it\u2019s different. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/simoncoveney/status/1250348979595792392\">Simon Coveney</a>, the foreign minister of Ireland, a country with exceptionally close ties with the United States, described Trump\u2019s decision to cut funds to WHO as an \u201cindefensible decision, in midst of global pandemic. So many vulnerable populations rely on WHO \u2013 deliberately undermining funding and trust now is shocking.\u201d Heiko Maas, the German foreign minister was slightly more restrained, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HeikoMaas/status/1250322386907357185\">tweeting</a> that: \u201cBlaming does not help. The virus knows no borders\u201d. In the UK, however, where ministers are still hoping for a post-Brexit trade deal, a Downing Street spokesman <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/15/coronavirus-us-live-trump-decision-cut-who-funding-sparks-outrage-latest-news-updates?page=with:block-5e9702b88f08213494be7188#block-5e9702b88f08213494be7188\">rejected an invitation</a> to join the condemnation, although they did voice support for the WHO.</p> <p>Why undermine the organisation that is at the forefront of responding to a pandemic? For Trump, this seems particularly illogical \u2013 the pandemic has already killed <a href=\"https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa/u-s-coronavirus-death-toll-tops-30000-new-yorkers-told-to-wear-masks-idUKKCN21X25I\">more than 30,000 Americans</a>. The answer is<strong> </strong>simple. In the midst of an election year, with his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/10/trump-poll-numbers-dip-handling-coronavirus\">approval ratings</a> falling, Trump needs to find someone else to blame. Now that the daily White House briefings have taken on the role of campaign rallies in locked down America, nothing can be allowed to undermine the narrative that he is the saviour of the American people. Failings are the fault of others. Once it was the Mexicans <strong>(</strong>ironically, Mexico is now <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-52053656\">restricting Americans from entering</a> the country<strong>)</strong>. Then it was China, whose political leaders Trump considers insufficiently obsequious. Now, he has redirected his ire at the WHO.</p> <p>It hardly needs to be said that Trump has justified his decision with claims that fail to withstand the most <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/coronavirus-trump-halts-funding-to-world-health-organization\">basic scrutiny</a>. He claims that the WHO was \u201cseverely mismanaging and covering up\u201d the early stages of the pandemic, thereby delaying the response by the United States. Yet the WHO had warned of person-to-person transmission as early as 23 January. Six days later, his economic adviser <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/donald-trump-coronavirus-memos-warning-peter-navarro\">warned</a> of the possibility of hundreds of thousands of American deaths. Trump ignored them both.</p> <p>The decision will clearly damage the WHO. First, there is the loss of funding. As the world\u2019s richest country, the United States contributes 40% of the WHO\u2019s core budget, although this only amounts to 20% of its total spending. The US also contributes the largest share to the remaining 80% of voluntary contributions.</p> <p>The US theoretically contributes roughly<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/world-health-organization-why-has-trump-suspended-funding\"> 10-15% of the WHO\u2019s budget</a> as its largest contributor. It\u2019s uncertain whether Trump can legally block payments to the WHO\u2019s core budget, as these are authorised by Congress<strong>,</strong> but he could stop those voluntary payments made by federal agencies such as the Centers for Disease Control.</p> <p>With a total contribution of a <a href=\"https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/trump-is-desperate-to-find-someone-to-blame-for-his-coronavirus-failings\">little under $900m</a>, roughly what the NHS spends in 36 hours, other countries could step up to the mark to replace at least some of this shortfall. However, the decision will likely have a disproportionate effect on areas where the United States has made substantial earmarked contributions, such as polio eradication. More importantly, this is a massive distraction for an organisation working flat out to tackle one of the most serious threats to the health of everyone, including Americans, in decades.</p> <p>The Covid-19 pandemic has exposed the weaknesses of individual leaders and international cooperation. In a world where Jair Bolsanaro can threaten the world by allowing the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/21/jair-bolsonaro-accuses-ngos-setting-fire-amazon-rainforest\">Amazon</a> to burn<strong>,</strong> or Donald Trump can undermine those leading the response to a pandemic, the need for a new international order has never been more urgent.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 </strong>Martin McKee is professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and an adviser to the World Health Organization</p>",

That time period \u2013 known as the access period \u2013 will now be reduced to a minimum of one day. </strong></p> \n  <p>Importantly, employers will still need to meet the essential conditions required under the \u201cgenuine agreement\u201d test that is ultimately determined by the Fair Work Commission. This is a safeguard to ensure workers are able to make informed decisions about changes affecting the way they work. Employees will also still be able to vote down a proposed change to agreements.</p> \n  <p>These changes have also been time-bound and will revert to the usual 7 day period automatically in six months. Having listened to concerns raised by the ACTU, the Attorney-General has also determined to review the operation of the changes in two months to assess whether the system has been operating effectively without misuse. If substantial evidence were to emerge that the changes are not operating effectively, the time period can be altered again at that point of two-month review.</p> \n  <p>Importantly, the regulation change applies to all businesses with employees covered by EBA\u2019s, including those not eligible for JobKeeper payments.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThese changes are designed to enable companies to deal swiftly with urgent issues that are arising in their workplaces, such as health and safety issues associated with COVID-19,\u201d Attorney-General and Minister for Industrial Relations, Christian Porter said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cFor example, businesses that have urgently needed to divide their workforce up into teams that rotate between working from home and in the office for social distancing reasons, haven\u2019t been able to quickly implement those changes due to the mandatory access period.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIn some cases, delays have been impractical and prevented employers from taking effective steps to improve the safety of their staff, or to ensure their businesses were able to function efficiently during these difficult and fast-changing times.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThese changes are only temporary and will expire in six months, in line with other changes to working arrangements that have been recently adopted, such as the amendments to the Fair Work Act that were necessary to facilitate the roll out of the $130 billion JobKeeper package and I intend to review the operation of the change two months after it becomes effective.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e97f4308f08cf571cdb1ed1\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-16T05:59:32.208Z\">6.59am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The ACTU and <strong>Sally McManus</strong> is not:<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cSome employers have not stopped demanding rights be taken off working people. We saw some openly try to force changes to the Fair Work Act that would undermine people\u2019s job security and rights at work in the lead up to Jobkeeper becoming law, those attempts were opposed by the union movement and were rightly refused by all political parties.</p> \n  <p>\u201cHaving been denied a legislative pathway for their power grab those employers, who have not suffered serious downturn, have spent the last week lobbying the government to take away workers\u2019 rights via regulation, they should be condemned, and the Government should stop listening to them.</p> \n  <p>\u201cBy agreeing to these changes Christian Porter would be using his power to abolish rules that protect workers, their job security and their rights at work.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThese changes will allow employers to ram through reductions in pay and undermine job security.</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe current rules ensure workers have adequate time to consider any proposal to change an enterprise agreement, to discuss this with their employer, other workers and to seek advice. This change effectively takes away all these rights leaving workers exposed to employers seeking to exploit the fear caused by the pandemic and to pressure workers into rushed agreements, locking out their access to advice.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe are already seeing widespread abuse of the JobKeeper system, prior to the pandemic Australian business had an enormous problem with wage theft. We know that, sadly, too many employers will exploit the system if there are no safeguards for working people.

It has been expertly handled by the Tasmanian health authorities in an exemplary way of bringing an episode under control. </p> \n   <p>But as the PM has said, if we relax the distancing measures that are stopping or reducing that community transmission, that will inevitably lead to some more outbreaks of community transmission. </p> \n   <p>Unless we are prepared as a nation to detect those outbreaks really early and get on top of them and control them and isolate the cases and quarantine the contacts, we could end up with large community outbreaks that could lead to situations like we\u2019ve all seen every night on the nightly news in high-income countries with good health systems like the USA and the UK. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7010ca324ca58c33d83e38d2de9be3f93e6b330f\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7010ca324ca58c33d83e38d2de9be3f93e6b330f/0_0_5472_3648/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prime Minister Scott Morrison and CMO Brendan Murphy at a press conference in the main committee room of parliament house in Canberra.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prime minister Scott Morrison and chief medical officer Brendan Murphy provide a Covid-19 update after the national cabinet meeting.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Bowers/The Guardian</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-16T05:19:28.642Z\">at 6.19am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e97e8898f08cf571cdb1e8f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/daniel-hurst\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-16T05:09:48.678Z\">6.09am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>According to slides handed out to journalists at today\u2019s media conference, Australia is estimated to be currently detecting approximately 92% of all symptomatic cases, while each state and territory is individually estimated to be detecting over 80%. <br></p> \n  <p><strong>The slides argue that Australia has one of the highest reported detection rates globally. </strong></p> \n  <p>The high detection rate doesn\u2019t mean the outbreak is out of control in Australia, just that we don\u2019t seem to be missing symptomatic cases.</p> \n  <p>The Doherty Institute is currently working on the next phase of modelling using Australian data to work out the current state of the epidemic, which will be known as \u201cnowcasting\u201d.

In short, leaders emphasise the value of providing education within classroom settings, but acknowledge that it is up to state and territory governments and the non-government school sector to make operational decisions. <br></p> \n  <p>There is also a need for schools to offer teachers and staff a safe working environment.</p> \n  <p>The full list of principles is as follows:</p> \n  <p>1. Our schools are critical to the delivery of high quality education for students and to give our children the best possible start in life. Our education systems are based on the recognition that education is best delivered by professional teachers to students in the classroom on a school campus.</p> \n  <p>2. It is accepted that during the Covid-19 crisis, alternative flexible, remote delivery of education services may be needed.</p> \n  <p>3. Our schools must be healthy and safe environments for students, teachers and other staff to ensure the effective and efficient delivery of education to students.</p> \n  <p>4. State and territory governments and non-government sector authorities are responsible for managing and making operational decisions for their school systems respectively, subject to compliance with relevant funding agreements with the Commonwealth.</p> \n  <p>5.

<p><strong>Pauline Wright</strong><em>:</em><em><br></em></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The Law Council remains concerned about the adequacy of public interest protections where warrants authorise investigative action involving journalists and media organisations, whether they are suspected of having committed an offence or whether they are simply third parties who may be in possession of information. </p> \n   <p><strong>The law continues to leave journalists and media organisations exposed to possible police investigation and prosecution. </strong></p> \n   <p>The Law Council believes that any similar case in the future could be avoided through law reform measures to protect and recognise the importance of public interest journalism and to incorporate greater accountability mechanisms. Protections might include contested hearings, the involvement of a Public Interest Advocate to test the warrant process and a requirement that warrants may only be issued by a judge of a superior court of record. </p> \n   <p>Australia\u2019s media is critical to holding government and its agencies accountable for their actions and scrutinising the exercise of power. Transparency and accountability lead to better decision-making and a stronger democracy that protects rights and freedoms and upholds the rule of law. This case is a reminder of the ongoing vulnerability of public interest journalism within the current legal framework. </p> \n   <p>We will continue to call for stronger protections to provide an essential balance in the face of the extensive powers Australia has given our law enforcement and security agencies. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-16T00:20:57.499Z\">at 1.20am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e979ca68f08ea7431f439f7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/ben-butler\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-15T23:46:06.560Z\">12.46am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Shares in Virgin Australia have been suspended from trade as the grounded airline desperately seeks a bailout.<br></p> \n  <p>The stock went into a trading halt two days ago but has so far been unable to secure a lifeline amid furious political debate over whether it should be rescued by the government.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cWhilst this consideration and these discussions have continued over the last two days including discussions which remain confidential and are incomplete, the company is not presently in a position to make an announcement to the market with respect to these matters,\u201d Virgin Australia told the exchange on Thursday morning.<br></p> \n  <p>As Guardian Australia has reported, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/14/virgin-australia-considers-going-into-administration-as-labor-calls-for-government-rescue\">options under consideration include putting the company into administration</a>.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-15T23:50:33.262Z\">at 12.50am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e979bdc8f08ea7431f439f6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-15T23:45:38.701Z\">12.45am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Most of these seem legit to me.

  "<p>With compelling symmetry, four days after Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/04/keir-starmer-wins-labour-leadership-election\">tenure as Labour leader ended</a>, Bernie Sanders suspended his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/08/bernie-sanders-ends-2020-presidential-race\">presidential campaign</a>. The insurgencies they led first gathered pace in a political galaxy far, far away, back in 2015, before the era of Brexit or Trump. Both were implausible figureheads: little known outside left milieus, used to addressing sparsely attended meetings on rainy Thursday nights rather than mass rallies, men of a certain age who were largely rejected by their own generations leading movements disproportionately powered by those born after they had reached adulthood. And now their often <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/corbynism-croaks-and-labour-sees-the-light-dcpwm2rs0\">bitter critics</a> \u2013 whether on the right or centre \u2013 celebrate their defeats as something more profound: as a rout of the ideas and political vision they had come to represent.</p> <p>They are likely to be disappointed. Yes, the British and US new left have failed to achieve lasting political leadership in their own parties, let alone assume state power; their activists are currently demoralised and exhausted. Both found a mass reception for their ideas after the left had spent a generation in the wilderness, meaning they lacked personnel with political experience, all while being undermined by entrenched hostility from their own parties. But on neither side of the Atlantic is the left going anywhere.</p> <p>Their opponents saw the Corbyn and Sanders phenomena as mass irrationality and delusion, as flight from reality and<strong> </strong>an indulgence of impossible dreams. In truth, both emerged because of material conditions for millions of people that , far from improving, are about to plumb new depths. There was a reason why Sanders enjoyed the overwhelming support of <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/02/this-one-chart-explains-why-young-voters-back-bernie-sanders.html\">Democrats under 35</a>, or why more <a href=\"https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2017/06/13/how-britain-voted-2017-general-election\">voters under 40 opted for Labour in 2017</a> than polling has ever recorded. This isn\u2019t a story of the supposed naive idealism of youth, slowly eroded by the experience of adulthood. If this cliche were true, then several polls in the 1980s wouldn\u2019t have suggested Ronald Reagan was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1984/10/16/us/younger-voters-tending-to-give-reagan-support.html\">most popular among the young</a>, while Margaret Thatcher would not have <a href=\"https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-mori/en-uk/how-britain-voted-october-1974\">won the youth vote</a> so decisively in 1983.</p> <p>The answer is straightforward. The free-market revolution promised to liberate the individual from the supposedly oppressive confines of the state and collectivism, to allow them to achieve their full potential unhindered. Instead, that \u201cfreedom\u201d was experienced as insecurity, which was only heightened by the aftermath of the financial crash. While nearly half of American baby boomers were homeowners by the age of 30, only just over a third of millennials have <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/25/the-homeownership-rate-is-falling-among-millennials-heres-why.html\">acquired a home</a> by the time they hit their thirties. The number of middle-income young adults in Britain who own a home has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2018/feb/16/homeownership-among-young-adults-collapsed-institute-fiscal-studies\">halved in two decades</a>, while getting a council house \u2013 stocks of which have been drastically depleted during the same period \u2013 isn\u2019t an option, and the privately rented sector <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2019/nov/20/housebuilding-data-shows-dearth-of-homes-for-affordable-renting\">devours their pay packets</a>.</p> <p>Those who went to university are clobbered with student debt, and even then an often low-paid, insecure job beckons. In no high-income country other than Greece have the under-30s suffered such a fall in income <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/363af3be-1236-11e8-940e-08320fc2a277\">as in Britain</a>. From cuts to social security to the shredding of youth services, so much that gave people a sense of security and the sense that things will get better has been stripped away. It is this that drove the Sanders movement, Corbynism, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/31/podemos-revolution-radical-academics-changed-european-politics\">Podemos in Spain</a>; and although all failed to convince enough of the older generation, proving a fatal roadblock to victory, does anyone think the material conditions that led so many young people to seek radical answers will suddenly evaporate?</p> <p>The opposite, of course, is true. When lockdown finally ends, the vaccine is injected into our veins, and commuters pack again into buses and trains, the question of who foots the bill for economic calamity will beckon. \u201cNo one wants to hear it,\u201d says<strong> </strong>George Osborne, singing from his only hymn sheet, \u201cbut we\u2019re going to have to make uncomfortable choices about how we pay for this.\u201d Those who spent most of their adulthoods in the shadow of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/11/lehman-brothers-collapse-where-are-the-key-figures-now\">Lehman Brothers\u2019 collapse</a> may find their wallets are going to be inspected again by Tory politicians. Unprecedented peacetime state interventionism has shifted what is deemed to be politically possible, while grand social injustices \u2013 how badly paid \u201cessential workers\u201d are, the economic insecurity of millions, the underfunding of the NHS, our shredded welfare state \u2013 have been painfully exposed. If now isn\u2019t the time for radicalism, then when?</p> <p>Here\u2019s how the story usually goes when the left is defeated. Disheartened and directionless, it is enveloped by infighting and bitterness, by the -internal spats its critics love to caricature as Monty Python-esque. This would be a grave error. While the likely Democratic nominee, Joe Biden, is politically closer to a \u201done-nation\u201d British Tory than a Labour politician, the US left has unquestionably radically repositioned the Democratic party\u2019s political centre of gravity. Keir Starmer\u2019s mandate is rooted in promising to abide by the core tenets of Corbyn\u2019s political prospectus. The British and US left must defend their political gains, resist sectarianism and strike broad political alliances.</p> <p>After its colossal defeats in the 1980s, Britain\u2019s left retreated into being a grumpy, isolated fringe; it fell into political opposition to its previous allies on the so-called soft left, many of whom then entered into alliance with the party\u2019s right. A repetition of history must be resisted. A coalition should be built between those who voted for Rebecca Long-Bailey or Starmer to defend the \u201c<a href=\"https://keirstarmer.com/plans/10-pledges/\">10 pledges</a>\u201d of the victor, from raising taxes on the rich to common ownership to extending the welfare state. The new left was an alliance between survivors of past political struggles, and a youth politicised by movements against war, tuition fees, tax avoidance, austerity and climate emergency. It is the latter group that must now assume its leadership.</p> <p>When the financial system crashed in 2008, the left had few ideas of its own in the bank, and was instead defined by slogans expressing what it was opposed to rather than any coherent vision of what a new society could look like. Now the left brims with policies and ideas that are not just appropriated by mainstream centre-left politicians but even raided by the political right. Those who were inspired by \u201cFor the many not the few\u201d in Britain, by \u201cNot me. Us\u201d in the US, by \u201c<em>\u00a1Si, se puede!\u201d</em> (\u201cYes, we can!\u201d) chanted in the squares of Spain have not gone anywhere. The age of corona and looming climate emergency demand an even more ambitious vision. The left has not triumphed, but it hasn\u2019t died either: and it may well be today\u2019s disappointed youth who will find vindication in a new world free of injustice that they may yet one day build.</p> <p>\u2022 Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist</p>",

Shall we begin?</p> \n<p>Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has announced new proposals to allow people to be with relatives in care homes who are gravely ill with coronavirus before they die, so that they can <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/families-to-be-allowed-to-say-goodbye-to-dying-relatives-in-care-homes\">fulfil their \u201cright to say goodbye\u201d</a>.

  "<p>Key developments in the global <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus outbreak</a> today include:</p> <h2>Global cases pass 2 million mark</h2> <p>There are 2,064,115 confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. The number of people who have died so far in the crisis stands at 137,020. The US is the worst-affected country in terms of infections and the number of deaths, with 639,055 cases \u2013 nearly a third of the world\u2019s total \u2013 and 30,925 fatalities.</p> <h2>IMF says Asia will suffer zero economic growth this year</h2> <p>Asia\u2019s economic growth this year will grind to a halt for the first time in 60 years, as the coronavirus crisis takes an \u201cunprecedented\u201d toll on the region\u2019s service sector and major export destinations, the International Monetary Fund said on Thursday. The IMF expects a 7.6% expansion in Asian economic growth next year on the assumption that containment policies succeed, but added the outlook was highly uncertain.</p> <h2>Trump fuels virus lab theory </h2> <p>The US president has added credence to a theory that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/trump-us-coronavirus-theory-china\">pandemic began when the pathogen accidentally escaped a Wuhan laboratory</a>, and has further <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/16/trump-wades-further-into-china-covid-19-row-as-focus-turns-to-easing-lockdowns\">questioned China\u2019s figures on the outbreak</a>. Responding to a question from Fox News on the lab, he said: \u201cWell, I don\u2019t want to say that John, but I will tell you more and more we\u2019re hearing the story.\u201d </p> <p>New guidelines are set to emerge on Thursday for some US states to ease their lockdowns, with Trump saying governors \u201cchamping at the bit\u201d to reopen. Trump did not back down on his decision to halt funding to the World Health Organization.</p> <h2>South Korea\u2019s ruling party wins landslide victory</h2> <p>President Moon Jae-in\u2019s left-leaning Democratic party and its smaller affiliate won 180 seats in the 300-seat assembly \u2013 the biggest majority in the national assembly by any party since South Korea\u2019s transition to democracy in 1987, after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/south-koreas-ruling-party-wins-election-landslide-amid-coronavirus-outbreak\">coronavirus pandemic turned the political tide in Moon\u2019s favour</a>.</p> <h2>Almost 700 sailors on French aircraft carrier test positive</h2> <p>At least 668 sailors assigned to the French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle\u2019s naval group tested positive for the virus, and results are still not in from a third of the tests from 1,767 mariners. In other news from France, Amazon has ordered the temporary closure of all six of its French distribution centres after a French court ruled it was not doing enough to protect its workers amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <h2>Big events unlikely to resume until 2021, says LA mayor</h2> <p>Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said Wednesday it is unlikely concerts and sporting events will resume until at least 2021, as the city continues to fight the coronavirus pandemic. Garcetti\u2019s comments echo those of New York City mayor Bill de Blasio and California governor Gavin Newsom, both of whom said it will be a long time before gatherings of 100 or more people are commonplace again.</p> <h2>Debt burden eased for poorer countries</h2> <p>G20 finance ministers have agreed to suspend poorer countries\u2019 debt payments to help them prepare for increased spending on healthcare. The measure takes effect from 1 May and lasts until the end of the year. The IMF said Asia\u2019s economic growth would grind to a halt for the first time in 60 years, as the crisis takes an \u201cunprecedented\u201d toll on the service sector and major export destinations.</p> <h2>Ten Britons and a UK stranded in Peru after missing repatriation flight</h2> <p>Ten Britons and a UK resident have been left stranded in Cusco, Peru, after missing a UK repatriation flight on Wednesday because a military aircraft which had been sent to collect them refused to let them board after landing and taking off twice, they say.</p>",
  "<p>From the window of his home study, Gordon Brown looks out across the waters of the Firth of Forth, towards the ramparts of Edinburgh Castle. It is a precious glimpse of open horizons, in a world closing in.</p> <p>The former prime minister is holed up here hitting the phones in search of what he considers the missing piece in the coronavirus jigsaw: a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/26/gordon-brown-calls-for-global-government-to-tackle-coronavirus\">coordinated global pooling of resources against the pandemic</a> and accompanying recession. No government can honestly claim<strong> </strong>to be doing \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d \u2013 the chancellor Rishi Sunak\u2019s refrain, echoing the European Central Bank president, Mario Draghi, during the 2012 euro crisis \u2013 unless it coordinates with governments worldwide, he insists to me over the phone.</p> <p>\u201cEach country will say: \u2018We\u2019re doing what we can\u2019,\u201d he says. \u201cEach country might even say: \u2018We\u2019re doing the best we can.\u2019 But nobody can say: \u2018We\u2019re doing whatever it takes\u2019 unless you bring people together \u2013 the key decision-makers, the key governments who can finance this. That\u2019s when confidence comes back to the world economy and that\u2019s when people think things can be brought under control.\u201d Leading Britain through the 2008 banking crisis taught him, he says, that it is not just about money, but showing you have diagnosed and gripped the problem.</p> <p>Brown\u2019s fear is that while we struggle with the first wave of infection, the foundations for a second or third or fourth are being laid, as coronavirus hits developing countries terrifyingly ill-equipped to suppress it. Covid-19 is taking hold in countries with struggling health systems, where some lack running water to wash hands, and where the choice is between risking infection by going to work or going hungry.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/mar/23/coronavirus-rich-countries-poor-west-covid-19-developing-world\">This virus is ravaging rich countries. What happens when it hits the poor ones? | Nesrine Malik</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI\u2019ve talked in the last few days to the prime minister of Ethiopia, the president of Sierra Leone, people in Ghana \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/apr/09/coronavirus-could-turn-back-the-clock-30-years-on-global-poverty\">they all know they have got a coming problem</a> and in some cases it\u2019s already there,\u201d says Brown. Helping them prevent disaster is not only right, he suggests, but in our own interests; so long as infection lingers anywhere in the world, it will keep coming back to countries who think they have beaten it. \u201cThis is not some abstract globalist thing,\u201d he says. \u201cNone of us are going to be properly safe until all countries are free of this.\u201d</p> <p>So, what does he make of Donald Trump\u2019s decision to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/15/trump-turns-against-who-to-mask-his-own-stark-failings-on-covid-19-crisis\">withdraw funding from the World Health Organization</a> (WHO) mid-pandemic, seen in some quarters as an attempt to distract from the president\u2019s handling of the outbreak in the US?</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s illogical, it is counter-productive, it\u2019s really sabotaging the efforts to coordinate global health and it\u2019s an act of self-harm because it will rebound to hurt America,\u201d he says, bluntly. \u201cIf the next wave of the virus comes out of Africa because the WHO and others have not been able to help them contain and suppress the disease, then no doubt President Trump will blame Africa and demonise them as well as the WHO.\u201d Yet he hopes the US may still fund some arm\u2019s length WHO initiatives on coronavirus, and insists he hasn\u2019t given up on a global response: \u201cI still don\u2019t rule out getting countries round the world to bring China and America back into cooperation.\u201d</p> <p>Brown has persuaded more than 200 ex-leaders and ministers, economists and medical experts to back detailed proposals for global cooperation that he hopes will make the agenda of this week\u2019s meetings of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank. The open letter they have signed calls for a global pledging conference where governments could collectively agree to fund the search for a vaccine, treatments, ventilators and personal protective equipment worldwide. Instead of competing for scarce stocks, Brown wants countries to cooperate in boosting supply for all. \u201cI\u2019ve got no doubt if there was greater global coordination you could solve many of the problems that we face in this country \u2013 but also other countries are facing \u2013 about the lack of test kits, the lack of protective clothing, the lack of ventilators.\u201d</p> <p>The letter also calls for a taskforce of the G20 group of powerful nations to agree assistance for developing countries, plus joint interventions to stop a global recession becoming a 1930s-style depression<strong>.</strong></p> <p>\u201cThe<strong> </strong>fear people have is that a liquidity crisis in companies becomes a solvency crisis, and a recession becomes a depression and that\u2019s what we have got to avoid,\u201d says Brown. \u201cAction can be taken to minimise the number of weeks and months the economy is closed down, or at least partially closed down, but the international action is important.\u201d The economic repercussions of the virus are, he thinks, \u201cbigger than the global financial crisis and there\u2019s no doubt that they are as big in some countries as the Great Depression\u201d.</p> <p>He flatly refuses to criticise Boris Johnson\u2019s handling of the epidemic, from shortages of protective clothing to the timing of lockdown. But isn\u2019t his letter tacit recognition that current leaders are failing? He sighs. \u201cI don\u2019t want to look back on what decisions have been made, I want to look forward to see what decisions could be made in the future. We aren\u2019t trying to criticise, we are trying to encourage.\u201d The convalescing prime minister, he insists, has his sympathy. \u201cI feel sorry for Boris Johnson, because at the moment, when the greatest call upon executive action is being made, he\u2019s found himself out of it. That must be very frustrating and very sad.\u201d Asked if he\u2019s in touch with Johnson, his stand-in, Dominic Raab, or Sunak, Brown says only that he\u2019s \u201ctalking to people who are in touch with the decision-making in government\u201d.</p> <p>Isn\u2019t he frustrated, lacking the power to do what he feels needs doing? A burst of laughter, which I suspect disguises a yes, rolls down the line. \u201cI\u2019ve got a few ideas that might be able to be helpful, but I\u2019m not claiming anything else.\u201d</p> <p>Yet this strikes closer to home than he cares to admit. It\u2019s when I ask how he is coping personally with lockdown that he momentarily falters. \u201cFor me it\u2019s uh \u2026 you know, we had to protect our son so we had to take action quite quickly.\u201d Gordon and Sarah Brown\u2019s son Fraser, 13, has the lung condition cystic fibrosis and government advice is to shield sufferers from the virus. It is a sensitive subject, the Browns guard the boys\u2019 privacy fiercely (they also have an older son, 16-year-old John). Brown doesn\u2019t want to discuss how this affects his political mission, but eventually says gruffly: \u201cWhat I do know is all of us have had to deal with a crisis at one point in our life, so you do feel whenever there\u2019s a crisis you have got to act quickly. That\u2019s what\u2019s motivating me at the moment.\u201d</p> <p>We are on safer ground discussing the books getting him through lockdown. He\u2019s just ordered the novelist Linda Grant\u2019s latest (he found her 2000 book When I Lived in Modern Times, the story of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/mar/26/fiction.reviews\">Jew from </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/mar/26/fiction.reviews\">the East End of London moving to what was then </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/mar/26/fiction.reviews\">Palestine</a>, \u201camazing\u201d) and is ploughing through policy proposals to retrain people out of work during lockdown. At 68, he scoffs at the notion of retiring: \u201cNobody retires now!\u201d</p> <p>But nor does Brown crave a comeback. When he surfaced on the BBC\u2019s Today programme in March, a wave of nostalgia surged through Twitter and he got some \u201cvery generous\u201d messages from the public. But while Tony Blair remains a political player, Brown doesn\u2019t regret leaving London to live quietly in his old constituency of Dunfermline East after losing the 2010 election.</p> <p>\u201cI used to say my best advice is not to take my advice,\u201d he jokes. \u201cI\u2019ve not involved myself in business or anything else and I\u2019ve not interfered in the Labour party. I\u2019ve just tried to do what I can to help various causes. I don\u2019t think former leaders should claim any special privileges or insights. There may be occasions when your experience is of use but you should be modest enough to realise that you\u2019ve got a new group of leaders and it\u2019s their time.\u201d He has discussed his proposals with Labour\u2019s new leader, Keir Starmer, but<strong> </strong>\u201cit\u2019s up to him to decide what he wants to do. I wish him well. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/05/gordon-brown-backs-keir-starmer-for-labour-leader\">I think he\u2019s an excellent choice.</a>\u201d</p> <p>He tweeted that Starmer\u2019s was the team that could return Labour to power, so why does he think Starmer can succeed where Jeremy Corbyn failed? \u201cBecause Keir\u2019s very good,\u201d he begins, before spotting the trap and declining to discuss domestic politics.</p> <p>Why does he think countries have been initially slow to cooperate against coronavirus? \u201cIn the first few years after 2010 there was a sort of defensive nationalism \u2013 protectionism, tariffs, building walls, people putting import controls down. I think in the last year or two, it\u2019s been a more aggressive nationalism,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re dealing with an atmosphere that is a problem. But I think people have got to stop re-running the debate between globalists and nationalists. This is about saving lives.\u201d</p> <p>Brown reckons a moratorium on debt interest repayments owed by the poorest countries could, for example, release \u00a340bn for health and social protection. \u201cThat\u2019s almost a decision that if you made today, the countries could act on it tomorrow.\u201d But some will surely need IMF bailouts, reliant on richer countries\u2019 willingness to finance them.</p> <p>During the banking crisis, Brown was working 20-hour days, knowing that if his recapitalisation plan failed and banking collapsed then anarchy could follow. What advice can he give leaders operating now under similar pressure? \u201cFor me, it was a huge challenge. You know people didn\u2019t always agree with the way I did it ... but you\u2019ve got to quickly understand what\u2019s needed to be done, and then you\u2019ve got to mobilise every possible resource to do it. Some of the methods you use are controversial, but you\u2019ve got to take the widest possible view.\u201d</p> <p>His mistake, he suggests, was succeeding in emerging from recession, but failing to convey the case for running a fiscal deficit to do so. \u201cYou\u2019ve always got to be thinking of what happens next. In Britain at the moment we\u2019ve got to get out of the immediate crisis, but then you\u2019ve got this issue of which companies are going to survive after you\u2019ve solved the medical problem.\u201d</p> <p>This Gordon Brown is mellower than the rather defensive one I encountered in office, perhaps as a result of no longer being constantly attacked. If it hurts to see the Tories lauded for turning Keynesian overnight, it doesn\u2019t show.</p> <p>\u201cThe irony is that 10 years ago, the conventional wisdom was that running a deficit, as Keynes had argued in the 1930s, wasn\u2019t fashionable,\u201d he says philosophically. \u201cI think we were right then and I think people accept that we did the right thing, but we got penalised for it. Now there\u2019s a better understanding that if economic activity in your economy collapses then the only organisation that can come in is the government. To be honest, it\u2019s sad that what happened in 2010 led to austerity and everything else, because that was the inevitable consequence of not understanding that you had to run a fiscal deficit to deal with the problem.\u201d</p> <p>Brown won\u2019t say how the current bailouts should ultimately be paid for, but thinks one legacy of the virus may be greater aversion to risk. \u201cThere\u2019s climate change, there\u2019s cybersecurity issues, nuclear proliferation issues. People in this generation are going to be more aware that the balance of risk and security has to be examined and that will raise questions about what people expect of government.\u201d</p> <p>If anything, he thinks enforced separation under lockdown has encouraged such solidarity. \u201cBeing isolated, people realise the need to be connected, the importance they attach to friendship, the importance of acting as a community.<strong>\u201d</strong></p> <p>After years of separatist political movements, from Scottish independence to Brexit, is this crisis illustrating the dangers of separation?</p> <p>\u201cIt becomes a moment where we have got to make a choice,\u201d he says. \u201cIf we can\u2019t cooperate on this, then it doesn\u2019t say much about the world and I do think people in the end will.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>And so I leave him to his phone calls; cloistered from the world now, but forever looking out.</p>",
