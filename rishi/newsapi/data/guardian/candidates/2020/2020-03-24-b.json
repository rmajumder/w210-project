  "<p>New York\u2019s governor, Andrew Cuomo, has issued his most dire statement yet about the coronavirus pandemic, warning that coronavirus infection rates are rising much faster than expected and the state\u2019s hospitals are woefully unequipped for the deluge.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe inescapable conclusion is that the rate of infection is going up,\u201d Cuomo said at a press conference on Tuesday morning. \u201cIt is spiking. The apex is higher than we thought, and the apex is sooner than we thought. That is a bad combination of facts.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/24/trump-fauci-meme-coronavirus-response\">Trump retweets Fauci meme criticizing his coronavirus response</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In New York state, 25,665 cases of coronavirus were confirmed as of Tuesday morning, with 210 deaths \u2013 far higher numbers than elsewhere in the US \u2013 as 14,776 cases and 131 fatalities were concentrated in New York City alone. New York is conducting more testing per capita than countries such as South Korea, which may partially explain the spike in numbers.</p> \n<p>The Democratic governor also attacked the Trump administration\u2019s handling of the crisis, saying federal authorities had offered his state just 400 ventilators when an estimated 30,000 additional machines will be needed.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe need to be smarter about this \u2026 we need the federal help and we need it now,\u201d he said, calling on Donald Trump to utilise the Defense Production Act (DPA) to force companies to produce medical equipment and provide them the necessary financial support to do so. So far, the administration has <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/22/masks-ppe-3m-coronavirus/\">relied on volunteer efforts</a> that Cuomo said were not appropriate for the urgency of crisis.</p> \n<p>He also rejected the suggestion, floated by the president in recent days, that advice from public health officials could be rowed back in a matter of weeks to protect the US economy, saying that sensible steps in both areas could be made now without increasing risk to more vulnerable people in society.</p> \n<p>\u201cMy mother is not expendable,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cWe will not put a dollar figure on human life.\u201d</p> \n<p>Speaking later in the day, the vice-president, Mike Pence, said the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) had sent New York 2,000 ventilators and plans to send 2,000 more on Wednesday. Trump said he wanted restrictions to be lifted by Easter Sunday on 12 April, and to see churches \u201cpacked\u201d with people.</p> \n<p>At the daily White House briefing, coronavirus coordinator Dr Deborah Birx said New York was the country\u2019s hardest hit area, and advised people who have travelled from New York City to other parts of the country in recent days to self-quarantine for 14 days to try to contain the spread of the virus.</p> \n<p>New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio directly contradicted Trump during his press conference Tuesday, saying it was \u201cinconceivable\u201d that the city would return to normal by April. De Blasio predicted that, in terms of the pandemic, April will be worse than March, and May may even be worse than April.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/coronavirus-dashboard-blog-size\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>With cases surging, Cuomo said new projections estimate his state will need 140,000 hospital beds once the crisis reaches its apex, which could happen within 14 to 21 days instead of in May as previously forecast. New York hospitals can currently support only 53,000 beds, and even the mandated 50% increase in capacity Cuomo announced yesterday will do little to undercut this severe dearth in resources.</p> \n<p>\u201cOne of the forecasters said we were looking at a freight train coming across the country. We\u2019re now looking at a bullet train,\u201d Cuomo said.</p> \n<p>Cuomo\u2019s urgent message comes as a spokesperson for the World Health Organization (WHO) warned the US has the potential to become the next global hotspot for the pandemic. The country already has more than 46,000 confirmed Covid-19 cases, resulting in close to 600 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.</p> \n<p>\u201cWhat happens to New York is gonna wind up happening to California, and Washington state and Illinois. It\u2019s just a matter of time. We\u2019re just getting there first,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cLook at us today \u2026 where we are today, you will be in four weeks or five weeks or six weeks. We are your future.\u201d</p> \n<p>The outbreak has led to a dramatic change in America\u2019s social fabric: as of Monday, the New York Times estimated that more than <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/world/coronavirus-updates-usa-world.html#link-72d95537\">158 million</a> people in 16 states would soon be under strict orders to stay at home \u2013 approaching half of the population. In New York, bars, restaurants, clubs and gyms have shuttered, Broadway productions have gone dark, airports have emptied out and streets normally filled with activity have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/new-york-coronavirus-cases-worldwide-covid19\">largely become ghost towns</a>.</p> \n<p>But even as state and local governments took drastic measures to promote social distancing and self-isolation, Trump on Monday indicated the country may restart its economy long before expected, and before some health experts recommend.</p> \n<p>\u201cAmerica will again, and soon, be open for business \u2013 very soon \u2013 a lot sooner than three or four months that somebody was suggesting,\u201d Trump said <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-coronavirus-task-force-press-briefing-9/\">during a press briefing</a>. \u201cA lot sooner. We cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself.\u201d</p> \n<p>The shift in messaging came after James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis, predicted unemployment could reach 30% nationwide, <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-22/fed-s-bullard-says-u-s-jobless-rate-may-soar-to-30-in-2q\">according to Bloomberg News</a>, and as negotiations for a coronavirus stimulus package dragged on for days in the US Senate. For weeks, suddenly jobless workers have been imploring the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7mrEyu5klE&amp;feature=youtu.be\">government</a> for help, and Trump is staring down what could become a <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/donbutler/2020/03/17/this-downturn-will-be-different-what-we-expect-in-a-recession-marred-by-coronavirus/#105a87022cd7\">historic recession</a> during an election year.</p> \n<p>Even still, medical experts have cautioned against such an abrupt restart to the economy while the virus continues to spread exponentially.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou can\u2019t call off the best weapon we have, which is social isolation, even out of economic desperation, unless you\u2019re willing to be responsible for a mountain of deaths,\u201d Arthur Caplan, founding head of the division of medical ethics at NYU School of Medicine, told the New York Times. \u201cCan\u2019t we try to put people\u2019s lives first for at least a month?\u201d</p> \n<p>On Tuesday, Cuomo said he understood that shutting down the economy is unsustainable, but he plans to develop a refined public health strategy that\u2019s also an economic strategy instead of sacrificing one for the other.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf you ask the American people to choose between public health and the economy, then it\u2019s no contest,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cNo American is going to say, accelerate the economy at the cost of human life, because no American is going to say how much a life is worth.\u201d</p>",

Mitt Romney\u2019s in danger after being exposed to the virus, and Mitt Romney\u2019s wife, Ann, has MS so she\u2019s at a higher risk for complications.

  "<p>Just a few weeks ago, I was confident that Donald Trump\u2019s days in the White House were numbered. The economy was tanking; coronavirus cases were soaring. And what was the president doing? Calling the coronavirus a \u201choax\u201d and mindlessly tweeting. On the same day, the Dow Jones <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/09/global-stock-markets-post-biggest-falls-since-2008-financial-crisis\">plunged more than 2,000 points</a> and Trump cheerfully retweeted <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/stocks-plunge-coronavirus-spreads-and-trump-retweets-image-of-himself-playing-a-fiddle-with-an-ominous-message-2020-03-08\">a doctored photo of him playing a violin</a>, remarking: \u201cWho knows what this means, but it sounds good to me!\u201d <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-nero-meme_n_5e658685c5b68d61645632c2\">\u201cNero\u201d</a><a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/donald-trump-nero-meme_n_5e658685c5b68d61645632c2\"> immediately started trending</a>.</p> <p>Trump may be fiddling while the world burns, but, over the past week, he has sharply changed his tune. The guy who recently assured us that Covid-19 would \u201clike a miracle \u2026 disappear\u201d now <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/us/politics/trump-coronavirus.html\">insists</a> that, actually, he knew it was \u201ca pandemic long before it was called a pandemic\u201d. Having realised he can\u2019t just bluster coronavirus away, Trump has rewritten the past, adopted a newly sombre tone and reinvented himself as a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/22/819672681/trump-tries-on-the-mantle-of-wartime-president\">\u201cwartime</a><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/22/819672681/trump-tries-on-the-mantle-of-wartime-president\">\u201d president</a>. Last Monday, Trump finally admitted the gravity of the situation and announced a 15-day plan to <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/03.16.20_coronavirus-guidance_8.5x11_315PM.pdf\">\u201cslow the spread\u201d</a> of the virus.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s new pandemic persona has been playing well. Last Tuesday, CNN\u2019s chief political correspondent, Dana Bash, <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2020/03/17/cnns_dana_bash_on_coronavirus_president_trump_is_being_the_kind_of_leader_that_people_need.html\">lavished praise on the president</a>. \u201cHe is being the kind of leader that people need,\u201d Bash told viewers, \u201cin a tone that people need and want and yearn for in times of crisis and uncertainty.\u201d The public seems to agree. A poll released on Friday by <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/coronavirus-upends-nation-americans-lives-changed-pandemic-poll/story?id=69696172\">ABC News and Ipsos</a> found that 55% of Americans approve of the way Trump is handling the Covid-19 crisis. That is a 12% increase from a poll taken on 11-12 March. A <a href=\"https://morningconsult.com/2020/03/20/trump-approval-coronavirus-response/\">Morning Consult poll</a> conducted from Tuesday to Friday last week similarly found that 53% of Americans approve of the way he has dealt with the pandemic.</p> <p>Trump has managed to turn himself from Nero to hero in a week. This is incredible, when you consider the fact that he has not done anything substantial; he has just acknowledged that Covid-19 may be more serious than the flu after all. But that is the beauty of setting an incredibly low bar for yourself; it is easy to fail upwards.</p> <p>Alas, it seems as if a week of halfheartedly listening to global health experts has proved too much for Trump. On Sunday night, clearly frustrated that the stock market keeps diving, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1241935285916782593\">he tweeted</a>: \u201cWE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF.\u201d In a press conference on Monday, he announced that the US will be open for business soon, and seemed to reject the idea that restrictive public health measures would continue for months. What does that mean exactly? Who knows. The only thing that is clear at the moment is that Trump cares more about the health of the stock market than the health of Americans.</p> <p>It is easy to dump on Trump, but it is not like the Democrats have inspired much confidence during this crisis either. Nancy Pelosi, the house speaker, recently shot down an idea to send cheques to every American because she wanted to <a href=\"https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/03/18/refusal-pelosi-consider-universal-cash-payments-response-coronavirus-pandemic\">means-test the payments</a>; not exactly a way to win hearts and minds. Meanwhile, Joe Biden, the presumptive presidential nominee, was <a href=\"https://jacobinmag.com/2020/3/joe-biden-coronavirus-pandemic-presidential-campaign\">missing in action</a> for most of last week; his absence caused <a href=\"https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/03/20/whereisjoe-biden-trends-sanders-host-coronavirus-roundtable-address-pandemic\">#WhereIs</a><a href=\"https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/03/20/whereisjoe-biden-trends-sanders-host-coronavirus-roundtable-address-pandemic\">Joe to trend on </a><a href=\"https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/03/20/whereisjoe-biden-trends-sanders-host-coronavirus-roundtable-address-pandemic\">Twitter</a> and sparked conspiracy theories that the 77-year-old is ill. <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/coronavirus-upends-2020-race-biden-seeks-offers-presidency/story?id=69697395\">A source told ABC</a> that Biden desperately wanted to be in daily contact with Americans, but was facing a few logistical challenges to video briefings; the ceilings in his home were low, you see, making lighting a challenge.</p> <p>If Biden can\u2019t figure out a home studio, I don\u2019t know how he is going to solve a global health crisis. Unless coronavirus kills us all first, it seems highly likely that we have another four years of Trump to look forward to.</p> <ul> <li><p>Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist</p></li> </ul>",
  "<p>I\u2019ve just taken advantage of my time in isolation to watch Richard Fleischer\u2019s 1973 sci-fi classic Soylent Green. My firm conclusion is that it is (even) better than the book on which it is based, Make Room! Make Room!</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2020/mar/17/make-room-make-room-harry-harrison-science-fiction-novel-coronavirus\">Make Room! Make Room! is a revelatory novel to read right now</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But before I go into that, I suppose I should acknowledge the argument that comparing novels to their film adaptations is unreasonable. They are different art forms. The experience of spending 20-odd hours reading David Copperfield spread out over weeks or even months is necessarily different from watching <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/jan/26/the-personal-history-of-david-copperfield-review-armando-iannucci-dev-patel\">the recent Armando Iannucci film</a>, although I\u2019m mighty glad that they both exist because they\u2019ve both given me a lot of joy.</p> <p>Yet while these comparisons may be invidious, that doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t be fun. And let\u2019s face it. No one beats Charles Dickens. Dev Patel is wonderful in the new film. The script is fantastic. Everything looks great. I laughed and laughed when I was watching it. I was also swept up in the emotion. I loved every minute. But! David Copperfield the novel is 600 pages of inimitable genius. And that\u2019s that.</p> <p>And even without Charles Dickens at the controls, novels generally have the advantage. There are no limits on their special effects budgets. They have more time and space to work through their ideas, immerse you in their worlds and involve you in their stories \u2026</p> <p>You know all that. These aren\u2019t ground-breaking ideas. But no harm in thinking about them now. Most of us have a bit of extra time on our hands, after all. These arguments are also worth rehearsing to help make the point about just how good Soylent Green is. It\u2019s easily better than Make Room! Make Room! - and that isn\u2019t necessarily a criticism of Harry Harrison.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2020/mar/10/make-room-make-room-reading-march-harry-harrison-soylent-green\">Make Room! Make Room! is our reading group book for March</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Harrison\u2019s novel has a few faults. Its drifting, unfocused ending doesn\u2019t deliver on the future-noir opening and its promise of a gripping detective story. And there\u2019s quite a bit of preaching about contraception and overpopulation to wade through. But it\u2019s still an effective portrayal of a messed-up world, and Harrison definitely deserves credit for some of the most effective moments and ideas in Soylent Green. After the picture came out, Harrison joked that it \u201cat times bore a faint resemblance to the book\u201d, but actually his fingerprints are all over it. Richard Fleischer\u2019s grungy, over-crowded New York with its disgruntled queues at water-pumps and violent food riots are instantly recognisable from the book. So too is the cramped apartment where the ageing hero Sol (played in the film by Edward G Robinson in his 101st and final screen appearance) pedals furiously on his adapted exercise bike to provide power for himself and his roommate, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/charltonheston\">Charlton Heston</a>\u2019s hard-bitten cop Robert Thorn.</p> <p>Just as in the book, this friendship forms the emotional heart of the film \u2013 but under Fleischer\u2019s direction, and with such good actors, it takes on new resonance. In the novel, Sol takes to making hectoring speeches about contraception. In the film (and now we\u2019re getting on to the serious spoilers) Robinson says far more with measured silences and misty eyes. In Sol\u2019s final moments, he delivers what must be one of the finest performances from an actor lying motionless on his back in cinema history, quietly weeping as images of the lost beauties of nature are beamed in front of him. It\u2019s a moving scene even before you realise that Robinson had received a terminal cancer diagnosis before he went on set (he didn\u2019t tell anyone) and from what depths those tears must have come.</p> <p>Then we come to the major difference between the film and the book: the big reveal that poor old Sol\u2019s corpse is going to be transported to a processing plant. Even though I was already quite aware that Soylent Green is people, I was still surprised by the power of the dialogue-free minutes where Thorn makes his discoveries.</p> <p>Harrison himself admitted that the film had a far better dramatic arc than his book, even if he also complained that turning starving people into food was inefficient because they\u2019d never provide enough meat. For myself, I was gripped. I\u2019d never completely sunk into the book and it merged all too uncomfortably with the news coming in about coronavirus. The film took me somewhere else. For that alone, I\u2019d be grateful. When you also factor in the catharsis of seeing Edward G Robinson\u2019s last great performance it starts to feel like something well worth the time. Which feels lucky right now \u2026</p>",

He reportedly ordered officials to downplay early warnings because he did not want bad news in an election year. The US now has one of the fastest rising numbers of new cases in the world.</p> <p>In Brazil, the ultra-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/brazils-jair-bolsonaro-says-coronavirus-crisis-is-a-media-trick\">equally reckless</a>. He claimed the risks of coronavirus were overblown, until 17 of his aides and security detail tested positive after a trip to the US. Last weekend, he ignored his own government\u2019s advice and chose to shake hands and pose cheek-to-cheek for selfies at a mass rally of supporters. As cases and deaths surge, his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/brazilians-protest-bolsonaro-coronavirus-panelaco\">support has plummeted</a>.</p> <p>In the UK, Boris Johnson acknowledged the risk, but did little about it. Though not as extreme in his denial as Trump or Bolsonaro, Johnson\u2019s government first dithered, then dabbled with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/18/coronavirus-uk-expert-advice-wrong\">policy of \u201cherd-immunity\u201d</a>that was reportedly driven by Dominic Cummings\u2019 desire to protect the economy, even if it cost pensioners\u2019 lives. The UK has since shifted tack and enforced a lockdown, but its controls are still haphazard. Last week, daily deaths in the UK were reckoned to be on a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jburnmurdoch/status/1240723388336877569?s=21\">steeper upward curve</a> than Italy was at the same stage.</p> <p>By contrast, more interventionist governments \u2013 generally but not exclusively those which are centrist or leftwing \u2013 have acted more quickly and shared the burden of risk more widely. Norway, Denmark and Sweden already appear to have flattened the coronavirus curve. Spain and France implemented lockdowns at around 200 deaths, which the UK and US have far surpassed.</p> <p>In Asia, China initially attempted to hide the problem from the public when the virus emerged in Wuhan, then mobilised huge public resources to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/chinas-coronavirus-lockdown-strategy-brutal-but-effective\">enforce a strict lockdown</a> and provide extra hospital beds. South Korea, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/07/coronavirus-outbreak-taipei-taiwan-china\">Taiwan</a> and Thailand also appear to have turned the corner thanks to different combinations of extensive testing, quarantine measures and public health education.</p> <p>Other factors are at play. Asian countries with prior experience of the Sars epidemic appear to have been better prepared. Italy, one of the worst affected countries, has one of the world\u2019s oldest populations. In Japan\u2019s case, the relatively flat curve of confirmed cases may also be a result of the government\u2019s unwillingness to do widespread testing because it could <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/24/tokyo-2020-olympics-will-be-postponed-within-days-due-to-coronavirus\">jeopardise the Olympics</a>.</p> <p>Similarly, the relatively low number of cases in the global south has raised hopes that warmer weather <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/615381/coronavirus-spread-could-slow-with-warmer-weather/\">might slow the disease</a> \u2013 but this is far from certain. A comparatively low number of coronavirus cases could be the result of a lag caused by distance from the origin of the disease, relatively lower levels of international traffic, and fewer resources for testing.</p> <p>This pandemic has amplified the importance of assessing and controlling risk before it gets out of hand. But the political champions of the neoliberal right, such as Trump and Bolsonaro, are more inclined to deny and delay, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/aug/26/the-guardian-view-on-the-threat-of-bolsonaro-tropical-disaster-is-man-made\">climate politics have shown us</a> in recent years.</p> <p>When it comes to a pandemic like Covid-19, that position is untenable. No leader can deny the science, nor can they endlessly delay action as they have done on global heating.

Until now, the left has recognised these dangers, but done little to act on them because economic growth has always taken precedence.</p> <p>The pandemic has proved that delays are deadly and expensive. If we are to avoid a cascade of future crises, governments must <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/24/coronavirus-crisis-change-world-financial-global-capitalism\">think beyond a return to business as usual</a>. Our conception of what is \u201cnormal\u201d will have to change. We\u2019ll need to invest in natural life-supporting systems such as a stable climate, fresh air and clean water. In the past, those goals have been dismissed as unrealistic or expensive, but recent weeks have shown how quickly the political compass can shift.</p> <p>First though, we need to accept \u2013 and share \u2013 risk. Instead of deferring risks to future generations, weaker populations and natural systems, governments need to transform risks into responsibilities we all bear.

At this stage, the threat of contagion is very high, which means that measures to limit the movement of people are legitimized.</p> <p>Similarly, most countries are woefully ill-prepared for the pandemic, with hospitals dangerously overcrowded and underresourced, requiring urgent state intervention.

  "<p>The economic rescue packages to deal with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/15/prepare-for-the-coronavirus-global-recession\">impact of the coronavirus</a> must also be green, a growing chorus of environmental campaigners have urged, concerned that hasty measures will lock the world into a high-carbon future.</p> \n<p>\u201cGovernments need to put huge amounts of money into trying to sustain jobs and livelihoods,\u201d said Mary Robinson, a former Irish president and UN high commissioner for human rights, who served twice as UN climate envoy. \u201cBut they must do it with a very strong green emphasis. The threat from climate change is as real as the threat from Covid-19, though it seems far away.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u201cMoney has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/18/global-banks-climate-crisis-finance-fossil-fuels\">poured</a> into the fossil fuel industry since the Paris agreement [of 2015],\u201d she said. \u201cThat can\u2019t continue.\u201d</p> \n<p>But she said the changes wrought in societies around the world by dealing with Covid-19 would also demonstrate to people that the changes needed to achieve a low-carbon future were much less drastic and far more palatable. As far as the climate was concerned, \u201cwe must not go back to bad habits afterwards\u201d, she said. \u201cIt will be easier to persuade people, as we have had to change so dramatically because of this threat.\u201d</p> \n<p>Economic plans worth trillions of dollars in public money are being rolled out to stave off the immediate collapse of some badly hit businesses, such as airlines and tourism \u2013 and to protect the incomes of workers in danger of redundancy as normal life becomes impossible across Europe and large parts of the US, as it already has in many parts of east Asia.</p> \n<p>But while people\u2019s health and the immediate welfare of workers caught up in the crisis are paramount, campaigners and experts fear that if the longer-term packages are not carefully designed they will only entrench fossil fuel dependence across the global economy.</p> \n<p>\u201cGovernments are drawing up stimulus plans to counter the economic damage from coronavirus,\u201d said Fatih Birol, the executive director of the International Energy Agency. \u201cThese stimulus packages offer an excellent opportunity to ensure that the essential task of building a secure and sustainable energy future doesn\u2019t get lost amid the flurry of immediate priorities.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0a09a661-0ee2-41ea-b0a0-9e1deefd9268\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p><strong>What is Covid-19?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Covid-19 is caused by a member of the coronavirus family that has never been encountered before. Like other coronaviruses, it has come from animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared it a pandemic.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>What are the symptoms this coronavirus causes?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>According to the WHO, the most common symptoms of Covid-19 are fever, tiredness and a dry cough. Some patients may also have a runny nose, sore throat, nasal congestion and aches and pains or diarrhoea. Some people report losing their sense of taste and/or smell. About 80% of people who get Covid-19 experience a mild case \u2013 about as serious as a regular cold \u2013 and recover without needing any special treatment.</p>\n    <p>About one in six people, the WHO says, become seriously ill. The elderly and people with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, or chronic respiratory conditions, are at a greater risk of serious illness from Covid-19.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, the National health Service (NHS) has identified the specific symptoms to look for as experiencing either:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>a high temperature - you feel hot to touch on your chest or back</li>\n     <li>a new continuous cough - this means you\u2019ve started coughing repeatedly</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>As this is viral pneumonia, antibiotics are of no use. The antiviral drugs we have against flu will not work, and there is currently no vaccine. Recovery depends on the strength of the immune system.</p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p><strong>Should I go to the doctor if I have a cough?</strong></p>\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Medical advice varies around the world - with many countries imposing travel bans and lockdowns to try and prevent the spread of the virus. In many place people are being told to stay at home rather than visit a doctor of hospital in person. Check with your local authorities.</p>\n    <p>In the UK, NHS advice is that anyone with symptoms should<b> stay at home for at least 7 days</b>. If you live with other people, <b>they should stay at home for at least 14 days</b>, to avoid spreading the infection outside the home.</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The Bank of England is resuming <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/19/bank-of-englands-qe-programme-is-bigger-than-the-city-expected\">its quantitative easing programme</a> of buying up assets to create liquidity in the financial system, as it did after the 2008 crash, but there are concerns that the programme has previously been used to buy bonds from fossil fuel companies including Shell, BP and Total.</p> \n<p>There have been calls in some areas, such as eastern Europe and in Asia, to ignore climate concerns and pour stimulus money into existing high-carbon businesses and fossil fuels, rather than seeking a balance with a longer-term view that includes the need to curb emissions.</p> \n<p>John Sauven, the executive director of Greenpeace UK, said governments must act urgently to protect people\u2019s livelihoods, which could be done without directing the money to prop up ailing sectors whose long-term future was already threatened by the climate crisis.</p> \n<p>\u201cDecisions are being made now about whether to spend billions rescuing airlines, cruise ships, the oil and gas industry, among many others,\u201d he said. \u201cBailing out the shareholders of dirty industries to continue businessasusual rather than protecting workers and their families means we would have learnt nothing from the bank bailout during the financial crisis.\u201d</p> \n<p>Green campaigners have long talked about a \u201cjust transition\u201d that would enable workers to move away from fossil fuel-dependent jobs and into skilled jobs with long-term low-carbon prospects. They argue this is compatible with tackling the coronavirus, too \u2013 but only if governments resist calls to downgrade environmental aims in light of the new crisis.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom element--showcase\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/03/interactive-coronavirus-live/world\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>\u201cDiluting or doing away with environmental regulations to get a quick economic hit, as China and Poland are suggesting, would be misplaced \u2013 out of the frying pan, into the fire, even if the fire seems a few years away,\u201d said Shaun Spiers, the executive director of the Green Alliance thinktank. \u201cIt is striking that the ruling party in South Korea has not let coronavirus deter it from proposing a green new deal <a href=\"https://www.greenpeace.org/international/press-release/29305/south-koreas-ruling-political-party-becomes-east-asias-first-to-announce-green-new-deal-manifesto/\">election manifesto</a>. But I would expect the UK to prioritise the immediate economic impact while also applying a climate lens and thinking about the longer term.\u201d</p> \n<p>In the US, campaigners are concerned that Donald Trump\u2019s hostility to climate science and wooing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/27/fossil-fuel-industry-clout-trump-era\">of fossil fuel industries</a> will skew the economic rescue packages in harmful ways. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/18/america-airlines-bailout-shareholders-coronavirus\">planned bailout</a> for airlines and the cruise industry\u2019s request for cash are an immediate worry.</p> \n<p>\u201cGiven that airlines produce a very large and growing amount of climate pollution, any financial assistance should include requirements that these companies take action to reduce their emissions,\u201d said Annie Petsonk of the US-based Environmental Defense Fund. \u201cThe cruise industry, which has also requested billions in aid, has serious environmental impacts as well, and should meet new standards in exchange for government funding.\u201d</p> \n<p>She said that in return for public money, companies should give firm commitments on carbon. \u201c[That] would be a major step in the fight against climate change. Taxpayers, many of whom are now struggling financially, have the right to expect responsible behaviour in exchange for bailouts. They should not be funding private businesses only to see them create more costs for the public \u2013 in the form of climate impacts \u2013 in the future.\u201d</p> \n<p>For many experts, the vital point is that the lessons from the stimulus following the financial crisis more than a decade ago are learned. Then, as now, global greenhouse gas emissions paused as the crisis hit. But after the immediate impact, emissions began their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/may/29/carbon-emissions-nuclearpower\">steady rise again</a> and have continued <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/dec/04/paris-climate-deal-world-not-on-track-to-meet-goal-amid-continuous-emissions\">to do so since</a>, partly because the chance was missed to use the vast amounts of public money to set the world on a green path.</p> \n<p>\u201cGiven the state will never again play such a powerful role in our economy, and more broadly the global economy, if there was ever a time to join the dots between responding to the health emergency and the climate and nature emergency then this is it,\u201d said Sauven. \u201cThe worst case would be that you haven\u2019t used this awful crisis to reorientate the economy to achieve a much better outcome for people and the environment globally.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Standing in the Brady briefing room at the White House last week, Donald Trump said that despite new restrictions on the number of journalists allowed in the room, there were still too many reporters around.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re actually sitting too close,\u201d the president told the journalists. \u201cWe should probably get rid of about another 75, 80% of you. I have just two or three that I like in this room.\u201d</p> <p>If it was a joke, the timing was terrible.</p> <p>As the coronavirus crisis has grown, so too has the power of the president\u2019s whim to shape American life, whether that means choosing which states get emergency medical equipment first, deciding where to deploy troops to build temporary hospitals \u2013 or controlling what the public knows about what the government is doing.</p> <p>In recent weeks, Trump has invoked emergency powers enabling him to waive certain healthcare regulations and direct enormous streams of cash to areas of need. He has also announced that the federal government would use its authority to direct private companies to boost the production of surgical masks, gloves and other equipment, although the status of those efforts was unclear.</p> <p>For now the risk \u2013 the seeming surety \u2013 of a national disaster has fostered a willingness in even Trump\u2019s harshest critics for him to aggressively seize the reins of his office and marshal the power of the federal government toward a muscular and decisive response that could save thousands of lives.</p> <p>But with this widespread desire for action has come related concerns about where, exactly, that power will stop growing, when the emergency crests, and how that power will shrink when the crisis subsides.</p> <p>Civil society advocates warn the fog of crisis could give Trump cover to grab adjacent powers, not related to the current emergency, that might be difficult to claw back \u2013 especially if Congress and the courts failed to check Trump after the fact.</p> <p>\u201cOrdinarily, that\u2019s not something you\u2019d be worried about, because it would seem kind of unthinkable for a president to exploit a pandemic to arrogate a bunch of power that he doesn\u2019t need,\u201d said Elizabeth Goitein, co-director of the liberty and national security program at the Brennan Center for Justice.</p> <p>\u201cBut we have seen that this president is willing to abuse emergency powers, and to use them for political gains. And so we have to worry.\u201d</p> <p>By <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/proclamation-declaring-national-emergency-concerning-novel-coronavirus-disease-covid-19-outbreak/\">invoking</a> the National Emergencies Act on 13 March, Trump gained access to emergency powers in more than 100 other statutes, Goitein said, \u201cand if you look at those authorities, very few of them relate to health crises\u201d. With incremental action, Trump could expand government control of the internet, freeze private assets or change the size and composition of the armed forces.</p> <p>Other steps Trump has taken in the coronavirus response, such as restricting international borders and imposing mandatory quarantines for certain travelers, do not rely on emergency authorities but could create a legacy of expanded executive power that advocates fear could outlast the virus.</p> <p>One step Trump did not take after his administration <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2020/01/31/secretary-azar-declares-public-health-emergency-us-2019-novel-coronavirus.html\">declared</a> a public health emergency on 31 January was to reallocate funds to speed approval for drugs and ramp up the production of coronavirus tests kits. Trump\u2019s failure to deploy that power, the University of Texas law professor Steve Vladeck said, may have ironically created a scenario in which he ends up using much broader powers.</p> <p>\u201cThe president\u2019s dilatory use of the powers he has, I think, is going to end up requiring him to use a lot more of that power, in ways that are a lot more controversial and a lot more coercive and a lot more inconsistent,\u201d Vladeck told Benjamin Wittes of the Brookings Institution in a <a href=\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/lawfare-podcast-bonus-edition-steve-vladeck-emergency-powers-and-coronavirus\">Lawfare podcast</a> about emergency powers and coronavirus.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"38f39f4948cbc823d5c64fdcf4a908efd2ec8951\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38f39f4948cbc823d5c64fdcf4a908efd2ec8951/0_169_5098_3060/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Members of the Maryland national guard control entry to a section of parking lot on the south side of FedEx Field on Monday that officials said will become a clinic for coronavirus health screenings.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Members of the Maryland national guard control entry to a section of parking lot on the south side of FedEx Field on Monday that officials said will become a clinic for coronavirus health screenings.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Concerns that the administration would look for ways to use the crisis to move the lines of the law were sharpened by <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/21/doj-coronavirus-emergency-powers-140023\">reports</a> last week that the justice department had asked Congress to pass legislation allowing federal judges to detain people indefinitely without trial during emergencies.</p> <p>But analysts differ in their imaginations of how a dangerous expansion of power by Trump might unfold, with the economy in a tailspin and a presidential election on the horizon.</p> <p>Under extraordinary powers accessible to Trump after his national emergency declaration, he could declare the coronavirus to be a \u201cforeign threat\u201d and impose financial sanctions on anyone he said was contributing to the threat, such as a media company or a political opponent.</p> <p>He could announce an interstate travel ban, enforceable by the military, citing a need to stop the spread of the virus. Along similar lines, he could take steps that could make it harder for some people to vote in the presidential election in November \u2013 or make it more difficult for legal challenges to such steps to be heard in court.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not hard to imagine the federal courts in general, and this supreme court in particular, being remarkably deferential to the federal government in a public health crisis like this one,\u201d Vladeck told Wittes.</p> <p>Or, in what analysts describe as a worst-case scenario, the justice department could move for a federal judge to declare a breakdown of local law enforcement \u2013 at which point Trump could theoretically deploy the military in the streets, in a manner breaking with <a href=\"https://www.army.mil/article/45029/the_army_response_to_hurricane_katrina\">past deployments</a> of active-duty troops for disaster response.</p> <p>As an ominous reference point, civil liberties advocates point to anti-democratic moves taken by the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to close most courts, adjourn parliament and exploit secret cellphone data.</p> <p>\u201cWe have to be on the lookout for any use of these powers that goes beyond what public health experts are recommending as necessary, and that intrude on civil liberties,\u201d Goitein said.</p> <p>In offhand comments, Trump has occasionally expressed a reticence about the power of his office, which he elsewhere has described as unlimited.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of executive power, if we don\u2019t have to use it that would be a good thing, not a bad thing,\u201d he said at the White House last week. As late as Wednesday, Trump was resisting calls to invoke the Defense Production Act to get private businesses involved in mask and ventilator production, saying, \u201cWe hope we\u2019re not going to need it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3044778bfa1fcc6a503b5817444bff2200d26707\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3044778bfa1fcc6a503b5817444bff2200d26707/0_134_4015_2409/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump\u2019s track record offers no reason to believe that he will eagerly accede to the contraction of powers that expanded in a time of emergency response, experts warn.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump\u2019s track record offers no reason to believe that he will eagerly accede to the contraction of powers that expanded in a time of emergency response, experts warn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eric Baradat/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Berkeley law professor John Yoo, who crafted legal cover for torture programs in the George W Bush years, took a sanguine view of Trump\u2019s power and its containment.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s not a whole lot more I think that the president can do, unless we saw something much more serious occur such as the breakdown of law and order,\u201d said Yoo in a call-in forum hosted on Friday by the Federalist Society. \u201cEven then the president would need to rely on the request of state governors for assistance before he could intervene.\u201d</p> <p>But Trump\u2019s track record offers no reason to believe that he will eagerly accede to the contraction of powers that expanded in a time of emergency response, said Goitein, of the Brennan Center.</p> <p>\u201cIf you divorce his emergency orders from the context of every other thing he\u2019s ever said or done, you might be able to believe that,\u201d she said. \u201cBut if you put it in the context of a president who has said that article II gives him the power to do anything he wants, and a president who has ordered officials not to comply with congressional subpoenas, and a president who has said that Congress does not have the authority to impeach him \u2013 then I think you absolutely have to be worried.\u201d</p>",

It\u2019s looking like it\u2019s heading to 50,000 or more deaths \u2013 deaths, not cases. 50,000 deaths \u2013 which is, that\u2019s a lot. And you look at automobile accidents, which are far greater than any numbers we\u2019re talking about. That doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re going to tell everybody no more driving of cars. So we have to do things to get our country open.\u201d</p> <p>Yet last Friday, when the car accident argument was put to Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-vice-president-pence-members-c-oronavirus-task-force-press-briefing/\">he said:</a> \u201cThat\u2019s totally way out. That\u2019s really a false equivalency \u2026 I don\u2019t think with any moral conscience you could say, \u2018Why don\u2019t we just let it rip and happen, and let X per cent of the people die?\u2019 I don\u2019t understand that reasoning at all.\u201d</p> <p>Like an insufficiently loyal apparatchik in the Soviet Union, Fauci was suddenly nowhere to be seen at Monday night\u2019s briefing. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cspan/status/1242234983516966912?s=20\">The Guardian asked why.</a> Trump said: \u201cI was just with him ... he\u2019s at the task force meeting right now.\u201d Does he agree with you about the need to reopen the economy soon? Trump: \u201cHe doesn\u2019t not agree.\u201d</p> <p>But the president was joined by coronavirus task force response coordinator, Deborah Birx. She noted: \u201cI was not here over the weekend... Saturday, I had a little low-grade fever...\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/cspan/status/1242226099683237888?s=20\">Trump interjected \u201cUh, oh!\u201d</a> and cartoonishly recoiled to a distance. Attorney General William Barr smiled devotedly. Birx added: \u201cI got a test late Saturday night and I am negative.\u201d</p> <p>Trump gave an exaggerated, \u201cPhew!\u201d Again Barr smiled. But the room did not erupt in mirth. The president also mentioned that his wife, Melania, had taken a test that came back negative.</p> <p>Barr was on hand to discuss Trump\u2019s executive order to stop hoarding and price gouging. \u201cIf you have a big supply of toilet paper in your house, this is not something you have to worry about,\u201d the attorney general said. \u201cBut if you are sitting on a warehouse with masks, surgical masks, you will be hearing a knock on your door.\u201d</p> <p>In another reversal, Trump is dialling back his constant references to the \u201cChinese virus\u201d amid media reports of hate crimes against Asian Americans. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s very important that we totally protect our Asian American community in the United States and all around the world. They\u2019re amazing people and the spreading of the virus is not their fault in any way shape or form.\u201d</p> <p>The briefing finished at 8pm. Trump and co-pilot Pence returned to the cockpit. We\u2019re in for a bumpy flight. Gabriel Sherman, special correspondent at Vanity Fair magazine, spoke for many <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gabrielsherman/status/1242239867217743873?s=20\">when he tweeted:</a> \u201cThis is the first time I am genuinely scared. I must have been in denial before. But that presser changed everything.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump has said he is eager to reopen the US economy in weeks not months \u2013 even as the death toll from the virus continued to rise.</p> \n<p>The president, who is anxious about the effects of the coronavirus pandemic on the US economy, made the remarks at a White House press briefing Monday in which he repeatedly refused to confirm that he would listen to public health authorities if they advised him to keep restrictive public health measures in place, even at a cost to the economy.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>White House officials announced at the briefing that New York City, New Jersey and Long Island were emerging as a concerning hotspot for many new coronavirus cases.</p> \n<p>The US reported more than 100 deaths on Monday, the first time the daily death toll has entered the triple digits. There have been 557 deaths and nearly 44,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the US, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University.</p> \n<p>But in his remarks, Trump focused on states across the country that had seen few confirmed coronavirus cases so far \u2013 rural states such as Nebraska, Iowa, and Idaho. The president argued that it was essential to the economy be \u201copening up our country\u201d again as soon as possible.</p> \n<p>\u201cOur country was not built to be shut down,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThis is not a country that was built for this.\u201d</p> \n<p>During the briefing, White House officials praised Americans for their \u201cselflessness\u201d in the first week of widespread restrictions. Trump\u2019s top advisers referred to current government restrictions as a \u201c15-day challenge\u201d and pledged to revisit the need for sweeping measures to prevent the spread of the virus in just another week.</p> \n<p>Trump said he expected life to return to normal very soon, much sooner than in three or four months. Asked if he meant the country would be re-opening in \u201cweeks or months\u201d, Trump said: \u201cI\u2019m not looking at months, I can tell you right now.\u201d</p> \n<p>Asked if Dr Anthony Fauci, the immunologist who has become the public face of the American scientific community during the pandemic, agreed with him on potentially re-opening the economy, Trump said: \u201cHe doesn\u2019t not agree.\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/trump-social-distancing-coronavirus-rules-guidelines-economy\">Trump signals change in coronavirus strategy that could clash with health experts</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Trump added: \u201c[Fauci] understands there\u2019s a tremendous cost to our country.\u201d</p> \n<p>Fauci, who has spoken publicly about the challenges of focusing on facts even as Trump\u2019s White House has sometimes undermined them, was not present at Monday\u2019s briefing.</p> \n<p>As the record-high stock market has plummeted and then plummeted again, Trump has raised concerns that the \u201ccure\u201d for the virus could be \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1241935285916782593\">worse than the problem itself</a>\u201d. During the press conference, Trump repeatedly argued that a damaged American economy could create \u201cmore death\u201d than potential deaths from the coronavirus, because of an association between economic crisis and suicide.</p> \n<p>Trump said: \u201cPeople get tremendous anxiety and depression and you have suicide over things like this, when you have a terrible economy, you have death, definitely \u2026 in far greater numbers than we\u2019re talking about with regard to the virus.\u201d</p> \n<p>Although it is reasonable to suggest that a recession <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2020/03/23/coronavirus-pandemic-isolation-fear-job-loss-triggers-suicide/2871949001/\">can increase the risk of a rise in suicides</a>, experts caution that there is no single cause of suicide.</p> \n<p>According to research published in the <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry\">British Journal of Psychiatry</a>, North America and Europe experienced 10,000 more suicides during the 2008 recession. The outbreak of Sars in Hong Kong in 2002 and 2003 also led to a \u201csignificant increase\u201d in suicides in those over age 65, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20418214\">according to 2010 research</a>.</p> \n<p>But early projections for the toll of the coronavirus in the United States suggest it could lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths, even at the lowest end of ranges of estimates.</p> \n<p>Figures for the coronavirus mortality rate continues to evolve, but research from Wuhan, the Chinese city where the outbreak began, indicates the death rate there <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/health/wuhan-coronavirus-deaths.html\">was about 1.4%</a>. Experts <a href=\"https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2020/03/hundreds-of-u-s-coronavirus-cases-may-have-slipped-through-screenings/\">at Harvard University</a> have projected an infection rate in the US of between 20% and 60%, meaning that although it is impossible to reliably estimate the American coronavirus toll, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/16/upshot/coronavirus-best-worst-death-toll-scenario.html\">a reasonable scenario</a> might result in hundreds of thousands of deaths.</p> \n<p>At the Monday briefing, Trump said he found the emerging data encouraging. Asked if he was concerned that if he eased government restrictions to prevent coronavirus \u201ctoo early\u201d the virus might continue to spread rapidly, he said the mortality rate for coronavirus was not as bad as had been initially feared.</p> \n<p>Trump said: \u201cI mean, we started off \u2013 we were hearing numbers of 5% [mortality rate]. That would \u2013 that\u2019s an astronomical number, when the flu is .001 and two and three, right? And so 5% would be an astronomical number.\u201d</p> \n<p>Now, Trump said, he was hearing potential mortality rate numbers that were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/what-is-coronavirus-and-what-is-the-mortality-rate\">lower</a>.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe whole concept of death is terrible, but there\u2019s a tremendous difference between something under 1% and 4 or 5 or even 3%,\u201d the president said.</p> \n<p>On one issue, Trump expressed some interest in the possibility that coronavirus might reshape American life forever.</p> \n<p>As he looked out at the much-more-empty than usual White House briefing room, with journalists carefully spaced out to follow public health guidelines, Trump noted that the briefing room had once been full of lots of \u201cangry people who don\u2019t like me\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cWill we ever have that again, or \u2026 it will look like this forever?\u201d Trump asked his coronavirus response coordinator, Dr Deborah Birx.</p> \n<p>Attorney general Bill Barr, who was standing behind Trump, chuckled.</p> \n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Birx said.</p> \n<p><em>Oliver Laughland contributed reporting</em></p> \n<ul> \n <li><p><em>In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255.

According to research published in the <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry\">British Journal of Psychiatry</a>, North America and Europe experienced 10,000 more suicides during the 2008 recession.

  "<p>The US has said it will cut its aid to Afghanistan by $1bn (\u00a3840m), blaming the failure of President Ashraf Ghani and his main political rival, Abdullah Abdullah, to agree on a unity government for talks with the Taliban.</p> <p>A further $1bn could be cut<strong> </strong>from the annual aid package of $4.5bn in 2021, the US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, warned after a surprise visit to Kabul on Monday failed to persuade the two men to strike a deal. Pompeo suggested the aid could be restored if they changed their minds.</p> <p>The aid cut would represent about 5% of Afghanistan\u2019s GDP, but Ghani claimed in a televised address on Tuesday that \u201cthe US reduction in aid will have no direct impact on our key sectors\u201d. He expressed hope that the Afghan government could try to satisfy the US \u201cthrough talks and negotiations\u201d.</p> <p>The Afghan president also blamed Abdullah, who he said had been offered an important role in the cabinet, but had instead demanded changes to the constitution. Abdullah also released a statement saying that while Pompeo\u2019s trip had created an opportunity to resolve the crisis, \u201cunfortunately it was not utilised properly\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/23/pompeo-arrives-in-kabul-despite-us-advice-against-international-travel-coronavirus\">Pompeo to meet Taliban in Doha in effort to revive peace talks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Abdullah, who formerly held the title of Afghanistan\u2019s chief executive officer, refused to accept defeat in last September\u2019s presidential election, amid widespread allegations of fraud. He is seeking to set up a parallel administration in a palace next door to Ghani\u2019s presidential compound.</p> <p>\u201cThe United States is disappointed in them and what their conduct means for Afghanistan and our shared interests,\u201d Pompeo said in a sharply written statement. \u201cTheir failure has harmed US-Afghan relations and, sadly, dishonours those Afghan, Americans, and coalition partners who have sacrificed their lives and treasure in the struggle to build a new future for this country.</p> <p>\u201cBecause this leadership failure poses a direct threat to US national interests, effective immediately the US government will initiate a review of the scope of our cooperation with Afghanistan,\u201d Pompeo added. \u201cAmong other steps, we are today announcing a responsible adjustment to our spending in Afghanistan and immediately reducing assistance by $1bn this year. We are prepared to reduce by another $1bn in 2021.\u201d</p> <p>The secretary of state warned that other US projects, as well as US pledges at donor conferences, would come under review. He blamed the Afghan leaders for failing to abide by a joint declaration with the US made on 29 February to send a unified team to talks with the Taliban, and to free Taliban prisoners.</p> <p>In a separate agreement on 29 February with the Taliban, the US said 5,000 Taliban prisoners would be released in exchange for 1,000 government soldiers held by the insurgents. But the Afghan government insisted it had not agreed to free that many prisoners at once before broader peace negotiations had got under way.</p> <p>Pompeo told reporters that the first cut in assistance could still be averted if Ghani and Abdullah changed course, formed an \u201cinclusive team\u201d and went ahead with the prisoner exchange. \u201cWe\u2019re hopeful, frankly, they\u2019ll get their act together and we won\u2019t have to do it, but we are prepared to do that if they can\u2019t,\u201d he said.</p> <p>After spending more than eight hours in Kabul in unsuccessful talks with Ghani and Abdullah, Pompeo flew to Doha, where he held hour-long talks late on Monday night with the top Taliban negotiator, Mullah Baradar, at a Qatari air base.</p> <p>Pompeo said that in contrast to the Afghan government, the Taliban were keeping their end of the 29 February deal. \u201cThey committed to reducing violence; they have largely done that, and then they are working towards delivering their team to the ultimate negotiations,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The rift in Kabul and the breakdown of a planned prisoner exchange with the Taliban have stalled progress towards peace talks following the agreement of the temporary ceasefire, under which the Taliban said it would not attack US troops as they withdrew from the country.</p> <p>US and allied troops have begun their withdrawal but Taliban attacks on Afghan targets have <a href=\"https://www.afghanistan-analysts.org/en/reports/war-and-peace/voices-from-the-districts-the-violence-mapped-what-has-happened-since-the-reduction-in-violence-ended/\">almost returned to their pre-ceasefire level</a> and there is no immediate prospect of political negotiations between the insurgents and government officials that were supposed to start on 10 March.</p> <p>The two sides held talks via Skype on Sunday but there was no sign of a breakthrough on the core disagreement. The Afghan government wants a staggered release of prisoners but the Taliban are demanding that Kabul free all 5,000 of its fighters at once.</p> <p>The official number of coronavirus cases in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/afghanistan\">Afghanistan</a> stands at 34 but testing there is limited and the disease is expected to be much more widespread, posing dangers of an epidemic among prisoners in particular.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone clearly understands the coronavirus threat makes prisoner releases that much more urgent,\u201d wrote the US special envoy for Afghan peace talks, Zalmay Khalilzad.</p> <p>Pompeo staked his diplomatic reputation on <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Agreement-For-Bringing-Peace-to-Afghanistan-02.29.20.pdf\">the deal with the Taliban</a>, flying to Qatar to oversee its signing by Khalilzad. He took the decision to travel to Kabul and Doha at a time when face-to-face diplomacy has been reduced to a minimum. The state department has urged US citizens not to travel abroad.</p>",

But he said he remained optimistic.</p> \n  <p>Germany has closed all its schools, and on Sunday ruled that no more than two people can gather at once, except for families or people sharing a household.</p> \n  <p>Wieler said that current data on Germany\u00b4s Covid 19 cases indicates that the average age of those infected is 45, the average age of those who have died is 82. Fifty-seven per cent of those with confirmed infections have so far been men, 43% are women. Of the symptoms people have experienced, the most common is coughing (55%) and fever (40%).</p> \n  <p>In his daily briefing, which has just ended, he appealed to German medical students to volunteer in the increasing effort to track all new cases, which he said continued to be an important part in the fight against the virus. </p> \n  <p>A nationwide collection data point called Cosmos, which is gathering data on how the illness is being fought, shows a considerable increase in awareness of the virus, but still a considerable gap between awareness and behaviour, he said. Mobile phone data monitored anonymously at the weekend, of 30 million mobile phone users, showed that people have considerably reduced their mobility, but still not as much as was necessary, he said. Keeping a distance, regular hand washing and sneezing or coughing into the elbow still remained the most effective ways to avoid the spread of coronavirus, he added. \u201cKeeping your distance is the order of the day,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>There are about 24,859 cases of coronavirus in Germany.
