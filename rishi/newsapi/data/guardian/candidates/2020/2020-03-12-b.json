Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a close Trump ally, said that though he had \u201cno recollection of direct contact with the president of Brazil, who is awaiting the results of a coronavirus test, or his spokesman who tested positive\u201d, he would be working from home.</p> <p>It was also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JenGriffinFNC/status/1238150138041896960\">reported</a> that Wajngarten met leaders of Southcom, the US military\u2019s southern command, who then travelled to meetings on Capitol Hill in Washington DC and at the Pentagon.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/gabstargardter/status/1238118508166348800\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The guy standing to Trump\u2019s left just tested positive for coronavirus, according to Brazilian media.

The reports were discredited as fake news and none of Brazil\u2019s main media sites confirmed them. Bolsonaro has however taken a test, as Senator Graham said, and results will be ready on Friday.</p> <p>Covid-19 is a respiratory illness which can spread via sneezes or coughs or by physical contact. Most who contract the disease recover but it can be fatal, particularly among the elderly and those with underlying health concerns.</p> <p>According to the <a href=\"https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200311-sitrep-51-covid-19.pdf?sfvrsn=1ba62e57_8\">latest figures from the World Health Organization</a>, which on Wednesday declared the outbreak a pandemic, nearly 120,000 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with 4,300 deaths.</p> <p>In the US, the CDC <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-in-us.html\">reports</a> 938 confirmed cases and 29 deaths, in 38 states and Washington DC. Other estimates of the toll <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/12/mike-pence-us-decisive-action-coronavirus-trump-confusing-speech\">are higher</a>.</p> <p>As the federal government has struggled to implement sufficient testing and preventative measures, Trump\u2019s own responses have been widely criticised.</p> <p>The president has downplayed the dangers posed by the virus, which he has repeatedly compared to the common flu; predicted it would be killed by warmer weather, which experts say is not certain; said a vaccine is imminent when experts say it is not; and continued to shake hands with supporters in public, against the advice of health experts.</p> <p>Republican members of Congress including Trump\u2019s new chief of staff self-quarantined after an individual who attended the recent Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) outside Washington <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/07/cpac-coronavirus-conference-trump-pence\">tested positive for coronavirus</a>. Trump and Pence also attended that gathering.</p> <p>In an Oval Office address on Wednesday night, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/11/donald-trump-us-coronavirus-address\">Trump announced a suspension of travel to the US from Europe, excepting the UK</a>. At the same time, to a sense of growing national dismay, the NBA suspended its season after a player tested positive and the Hollywood actor Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson were revealed to have been<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/world/australia/tom-hanks-rita-wilson-coronavirus.html\"> hospitalised in Australia with the virus</a>. On Thursday, as disruptions to normal life increased, other major sports leagues also suspended their seasons.</p> <p>Speaking to reporters at the White House, Trump said: \u201cWe had dinner in Florida at Mar-a-Lago with the entire [Brazilian] delegation,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if the press aide was there. But we did nothing very unusual.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWe need a little separation,\u201d he added. \u201cUntil such time as this [coronavirus] goes away. It\u2019s going to go away.\u201d The president also said: \u201cIn the meantime we want to lose as few people as possible. This morning, is it 32?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThirty-two\u2019s a lot. Thirty-two\u2019s too many.\u201d</p> <p>Trump was meeting the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar. They avoided shaking hands.</p>",
  "<p>Anger is mounting in the US over the Trump administration\u2019s failure to test for coronavirus on a scale that could contain the outbreak and mitigate its most devastating impacts.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/mar/12/donald-tump-coronavirus-travel-ban-joe-biden-bernie-sanders-stock-markets-live-updates\">Trump has 'no plans' for coronavirus test despite contact with infected Bolsonaro aide \u2013 live</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>On Thursday the lack of testing capacity for Covid-19 was recognised in blunt terms by one of the top US officials dealing with the crisis. Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, described the current state of affairs as \u201ca failing\u201d at a hearing of the House oversight committee.</p> \n<p>From Congress to state capitals across the country, politicians of both main parties have shown rare bipartisan agreement that the pace of federal testing is woefully inadequate. Congress members who were given private briefings by Trump administration officials on Thursday expressed shock and outrage that so far only 11,000 tests have been conducted in a country of 327 million people.</p> \n<p>By contrast South Korea, which has been grappling with one of the most severe outbreaks of Covid-19 globally, tests roughly the same number, about 10,000 people, every day. In total, South Korea has tested <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/12/asia/coronavirus-south-korea-testing-intl-hnk/index.html\">230,000</a> of its 51 million people \u2013 130 times as many per capita as the US.</p> \n<p>The aggressive use of testing to identify carriers of the disease and quarantine them has been credited as a major factor in South Korea\u2019s relative success in dealing with the crisis.</p> \n<p>Answering press questions in the Oval Office on Thursday, Trump said: \u201cFrankly, the testing has been going very smooth.\u201d <a href=\"https://twitter.com/joshtpm/status/1238138713919705089\">He added</a>: \u201cWe have heavily tested.\u201d</p> \n<p>That is factually incorrect, and a growing number of public officials, including from his own party, are willing to say so.</p> \n<p>Members of Congress who attended a bipartisan House briefing expressed anger about testing failures.</p> \n<p>Mike Quigley, a Democratic congressman from Illinois, said: \u201cWe are not where we need to be and not sure when we are going to get there. We are flying blind.\u201d</p> \n<p>Mark Walker, a Republican congressman from North Carolina, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/12/politics/congress-outrage-testing-covid-19/index.html\">told CNN</a> that there was \u201ca growing frustration among members as a whole to get more definitive answers\u201d. The Republican senator and former presidential nominee Mitt Romney of Utah said: \u201cOur system has just not been up to snuff and I think a lot of people are frustrated by it. I\u2019m one of them.\u201d</p> \n<p>Andrew Cuomo, governor of New York, which is one of the states hardest hit by the disease so far, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2020/03/12/andrew-cuomo-coronavirus-testing-intv-sot-cpt-vpx.cnn/video/playlists/coronavirus/\">told CNN</a> the US was \u201cway behind on testing\u201d. What he called a \u201cfederal bottleneck\u201d was so bad that he had authorised New York authorities to contract out testing to private laboratories.</p> \n<p>Cuomo said the paucity of testing not only prevented containment of localised outbreaks, it also gave the public a false sense of security by obscuring how prevalent the disease has already become. \u201cIt\u2019s because we have no testing capacity, that\u2019s why the numbers are low. If you actually had testing capacity you would see how high the numbers are already. As we do ramp up testing you are going to see those numbers go sky-high.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022 This article was amended on 16 March 2020. An earlier version referred to the number of specimens tested for Covid-19 in the US on March 10 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and public health labs. The figure at the time was just eight, but this was an incomplete figure. The CDC\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/testing-in-us.html\">coronavirus database</a> indicates that the final figure for March 10 was 2,587.

The official number of confirmed cases is 596.<br></p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson confirmed that the UK was now moving out of the \u201ccontain\u201d phase and into the \u201cdelay\u201d phase for dealing with the epidemic.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This is now not just to attempt to contain the disease as far as possible, but to delay its spread and thereby minimise the suffering. If we delay the peak even by a few weeks, then our NHS will be in a stronger state as the weather improves and fewer people suffer from normal respiratory diseases, more beds are available and we\u2019ll have more time for medical research. We can also act to stretch the peak of the disease over a longer period so that our society is better able to cope.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson said that people with a fever or a new, persistent cough were now being asked to stay at home for seven days.</strong> He also said schools were being advised to cancel overseas trips, and the over-70s and the ill were being told to avoid cruises. He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>From tomorrow, if you have coronavirus symptoms, however mild -- either a new continuous cough or a high temperature -- then you should stay at home for at least 7 days to protect others and help slow the spread of the disease. We advise all those over 70 and those with serious medical conditions against going on cruises and we advise against international school trips. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said that at some point in the future the government would go further, and ask all family members to stay at home if someone was ill.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>At some point in the next few weeks we are likely to go further and if someone in a household has those symptoms then we will be asking everyone in that household will stay at home.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He also said that at some point in the future the elderly would be asked to stay away from places or people to avoid infection. He did not give details.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said at the moment he was not planning to ban sporting events, but he said this was being kept under review.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We are considering the question of banning major public events such as sporting fixtures. And the scientific advice, as we\u2019ve said over the last couple of weeks, is that banning such events will have little effect on the spread but there\u2019s also the issue of the burden that such events can place on public services.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>In a mild dig at Nicola Sturgeon, the Scottish first minister who is planning to cancel events with crowds of more than 500 people from next week and whose decision to announce the results of the Cobra meeting before Johnson angered some in No 10, Johnson said that Scotland might have a particular issue with the resilience of its emergency services. He implied that that was why the Scots needed a different policy. Vallance said cancelling sporting events could be counterproductive. He explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>On average, one person infects two or three others.</p> \n   <p>You therefore have a very low probability of infecting a large number of people in a stadium and a rather higher probability of infecting people very close to you.</p> \n   <p>And that means that most of the transmission actually tends to take place with friends and colleagues and those in close environments - and not in the big environments.</p> \n   <p>Though it is true that any cancellation of things can have some effect, if you then get a displacement activity where you end up with everyone congregating somewhere else, you may actually perversely have an increased risk, particularly in an indoor environment.</p> \n   <p>So it doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t at some point make the decision from a resilience point but this is not a major way to tackle this epidemic.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson defended his decision not to introduce measures as draconian as those being introduced in some other other countries.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The measures that I have discussed today... staying at home if you think you have the symptoms, your whole household staying at home, looking after the elderly - making sure the elderly and vulnerable stay at home - these are the three most powerful defensive lines.</p> \n   <p>We think it\u2019s very important to maintain public trust and confidence in what we are doing, throughout this challenging time, always to be guided by the best possible scientific advice.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He and his advisers also argued that, if self-isolation measures were introduced too early, they would be ineffective - because people would ignore them at the point where they were most necessary.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Whitty said he thought the overall mortality rate from Covid-19 was around 1% or less.</strong> It was higher for older people, and people in the vulnerable group, and lower for others, he said. But he said he did not want to speculate on who many people might die from the illness because he said the scientists just did not know how many people are infected. He said, although an 80% infection rate was the government\u2019s top reasonable worst case scenario, nowhere in the world was currently coming close to an infection level like that.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Vallance said that the outbreak in the UK could be about four weeks behind the outbreak in Italy. </strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Vallance said the peak of the epidemic in the UK was \u201csomething like 10 to 14 weeks away\u201d.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>That\u2019s all from me for today.</p> \n  <p>Thanks for the comments.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6a7aaf8f087df56e4c77e3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T18:21:06.369Z\">6.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Nigel Farage critique of Boris Johnson (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/mar/12/trumps-travel-ban-wont-have-much-impact-on-spread-of-coronavirus-says-rishi-sunak-live-news?page=with:block-5e6a79788f08c2df6d278784#block-5e6a79788f08c2df6d278784\">6.08pm)</a> is still very much a minority view at Westminster.

But there\u2019s a catch, or rather two. First, if you look at day-to-day spending on public services per head, it is no higher than it was in 2009-10 (because the population has got bigger). And, second, if you take out health, which received a sizeable, long-term spending increase under Theresa May, real-terms spending on everything else is lower than at the end of the Labour government, both overall (7% lower) and per person (14% lower).</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"be3d989cc63d9d4035285161238d9319379939ce\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be3d989cc63d9d4035285161238d9319379939ce/0_0_938_692/500.jpg\" alt=\"Real-terms public spending figures.\" width=\"500\" height=\"369\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Real-terms public spending figures.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: IFS</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>But the IFS also says these figures are potentially misleading, for two reasons. First, they include the \u00a311bn a year that the UK will save because it won\u2019t have to make annual payments to the EU - but they do not take into account the \u00a37-8bn a year that the EU used to spend in the UK. And, second, they include an extra \u00a35.5bn a year that the government is spending because of changes to the rules on employer pension contributions. The IFS argues that taking out these figures allows for a more reliable comparison with the past, and on that basis it has produced a chart with adjusted figures (see below).</p> \n  <p>On this measure, day-to-day public spending in real terms will still be higher in 2024-25 than in 2009-10, but only 5% higher, not 9% higher. But day-to-day spending per person ends up being 4% lower in 2024-25 in real terms than in 2009-10, overall spending excluding health is 12% lower, and spending per person excluding health is 19% lower.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b7e823ec34da069481ab0d7c1aeb734b08b2e24\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b7e823ec34da069481ab0d7c1aeb734b08b2e24/0_0_946_703/500.jpg\" alt=\"Real-terms public spending figures - adjusted\" width=\"500\" height=\"372\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Real-terms public spending figures - adjusted</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: IFS</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6a58268f087df56e4c75e6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T15:42:49.500Z\">3.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Sturgeon is now taking questions.</p> \n  <p><em>Q: What sort of gatherings do you want to cancel?</em></p> \n  <p>Ones that put pressure on emergency services, she says.

He explained:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The OBR\u2019s economic forecasts are a little more positive than the Bank\u2019s, but they are still very weak even before factoring in possible longer term effects from the coronavirus. Projected growth rates averaging barely over one and a half per cent a year for the next five years are feeble and indicative of an economy that is not in a robust position for coping with shocks like the coronavirus. The OBR continues to assume an orderly move to a free trade agreement with the EU. Anything less orderly, or a failure to achieve such an agreement, would weaken an already weak economy even further.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said that if coronavirus had a long-term impact on the economy, Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, would have to revise his strategy.</strong> Johnson said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Only time will tell whether any of the numbers in this budget will have meaning once the economic effects of coronavirus become fully evident ...</p> \n   <p>If the long-term path of the economy is affected then [Sunak] will also need to reassess much more of his fiscal strategy when he returns to the despatch box in the autumn.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said the plans for current spending were \u201cnothing like as generous as they appear\u201d. </strong>He explained:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Average annual increases of 2.8% sound substantial. Take account of the need to replace EU funding, and factor in planned increases for health, schools, defence and overseas aid, and there is relatively little here for other departments. If this spending envelope is stuck to there are plenty of public services which will not be enjoying much in the way of spending increases over the next few years.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said overall spending is due to rise by 9% in real terms between 2019-20 and 2023-24, \u201clargely paid for by extra borrowing\u201d.</strong> He said public spending would stabilise at around 41% of national income, \u201cabove its pre-crisis level and bigger than at any point between the mid 1980s and the start of the financial crisis\u201d.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>But he said current spending per head for most public services would remain well below 2010-11 levels in 2024-25. </strong>He went on:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>While austerity is clearly at an end in the sense that spending is rising, spending levels in many areas are set to remain well below 2010 levels for a long time to come.

Given that welfare support is targeted at lower-income households, and that the 2015 package of welfare cuts was so substantial (including the benefits freeze and two-child limit), the average losses for poorer households are very large. For example, the second decile will ultimately be \u00a32,900 a year worse off (on average) than if welfare policy had remained unchanged, with \u00a3900 of that still to come as a result of welfare policies still being rolled out. </p> \n   <p>Welfare cuts have been somewhat offset (in aggregate) by tax cuts. Successive cuts to income tax, through increases in the personal allowance and higher-rate threshold, have been followed in this budget by an increase in the starting point for national insurance, as well as repeated fuel duty freezes. But these changes have been of most benefit \u2013 in cash terms \u2013 to the top half of the income distribution, though this has been tempered at the very top by tax increases targeted at the richest tenth of the population.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dce2e891de391d34268cb33e03c1bb28ecdf1b08\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dce2e891de391d34268cb33e03c1bb28ecdf1b08/0_0_649_510/500.jpg\" alt=\"Distributional impact analysis of tax and benefit changes since 2015.\" width=\"500\" height=\"393\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Distributional impact analysis of tax and benefit changes since 2015.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Resolution Foundation</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T13:26:24.243Z\">at 1.26pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6a33228f08c2df6d2783a6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/kate-proctor\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T13:05:35.612Z\">1.05pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>President Trump did not contact Boris Johnson directly before his decision to ban citizens from 26 EU countries from entering the US for the next 30 days, No 10 has said.

He was speaking during business questions, and responding to a question from the SNP MP <strong>Tommy Sheppard</strong> who said that it might be safer for MPs during the coronavirus outbreak to abandon their normal method of voting (queuing up in a smallish lobby while waiting to have their names ticketed off by a clerk) and to instead use the deferred division procedure (voting using a ballot paper). Rees-Mogg replied that he had taken a Public Health England official into a division lobby and been told that the lobbies were \u201cnot a high risk\u201d.

She explained:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Mass gatherings, football matches for example, they need to be policed, they need to have emergency medical ambulance cover.</p> \n   <p>We are going into a period where our emergency services, our NHS in particular, will be under significant challenge and significant pressure, we may see all of our workforces affected by high absentee rates because of sickness, so there\u2019s a wider issue here about whether cancelling those kind of events is the right thing to do to reduce pressure on our front-line emergency workers.</p> \n   <p>From a wider resilience point of view, then I think there is a big question mark over whether large-scale events like that, whether it is sensible to allow them to proceed at the moment.</p> \n   <p>We\u2019re looking very carefully right now at whether large-scale events, whether it would be right and sensible given the situation we are facing right now to allow them to go ahead.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The UK government may announce a move towards new \u201csocial distancing measures\u201d after a Cobra emergency committee meeting on coronavirus being chaired by Boris Johnson this afternoon.

He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The US is still deciding the details of what exactly that means, but you are right. As I talked about yesterday, there will be an impact on the demand side of our economy as people are unable to spend in the way they normally would and travel, but it also affects the supply chains for businesses and that impacts the supply side of our economy.</p> \n   <p>As those supply chains are disrupted, the productive capacity of our economy will shrink for a period of time.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He dismissed claims that his spending plans were irresponsible. </strong>He said: </li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>I make absolutely no apology for responding in the short term in scale to the immediate threat that we face from coronavirus.</p> \n   <p>I think that\u2019s the right thing to do for the economy. We need to help businesses have a bridge to get to the other side.</p> \n   <p>In the medium term, as you will see from the figures, there is actually responsible economic management and it\u2019s because we\u2019ve had responsible economic management for several years that I\u2019m able to stand here in a strong position to say that we will do whatever it takes to get through this.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He said that his measures were compatible with the fiscal rules set out in the Conservative manifesto.</strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He laughed off suggestions that he had delivered a Gordon Brown budget, or a Labour budget</strong>. When LBC\u2019s Nick Ferrari put this to him, Sunak laughed, and said he would let others make that judgment.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He suggested that Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s resignation as Labour leader was holding up the announcement of plans for reform of social care. </strong>When asked about the absence of social care from the budget, he said that Matt Hancock, the health secretary, wrote to MPs last week <a href=\"https://www.politicshome.com/news/uk/health-and-care/news/110410/matt-hancock-kicks-cross-party-talks-social-care-crisis-letter\">proposing cross-party talks starting in May.</a> When it was put to him that the government was taking a long time, particularly since Boris Johnson claimed to have a plan for social care last summer, Sunak replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There is no permanent leader of the opposition at the moment. They\u2019re having a leadership contest, so we can\u2019 formally start that process until they have one.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Sunak defended his decision not to extend sick pay to cover the low-paid and the self-employed.</strong> In the budget he said that people in these categories would instead find it easier to claim benefits as a result of rules being relaxed during the coronavirus outbreak. This morning he said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>For those that don\u2019t [have access to statutory sick pay] we\u2019ve strengthened the working of our welfare system so that it works quicker, more responsibly and more generously for those people.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>He also claimed that around half of workers who needed to take time off would get more than statutory sick pay because their employers offered more generous arrangements.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He sidestepped a question about whether he and his family would be able to live on \u00a390 a week.</strong> Statutory sick pay is worth \u00a394.25 per week. Asked whether that was enough to live on, he replied:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We have strengthened our safety net to make sure we have access to benefits easier, quicker, more generously, and also provided an extra \u00a3500m to local authorities to distribute to vulnerable people and their local communities if they need extra support. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>When pressed on whether he could live on this himself, he said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>This is a safety net. That is what it\u2019s there for, to provide people to fall back on. It\u2019s obviously not the same as your day-to-day life</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He defended his decision not to include nurseries in the list of companies that will qualify for a one-year exemption from business rates.</strong> <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51843971\">The nursery sector has been horrified by the decision</a>. Asked why they were not included, Sunak said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Because what we\u2019ve done on business rates is target the sectors of the economy which are in the consumption side of the economy, which will see a very significant hit because of people\u2019s inability to spend. And what we wanted to do is make sure that they don\u2019t go out of business during that period of time.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>He accepted that his plans involved making an assumption about the cost of borrowing remaining low, but it was a judgment he defended.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>You have to make a judgment about the persistence of low interest rates, that\u2019s a judgment I have to make as chancellor.</p> \n   <p>The reality is these interest rates have stayed lower for longer than anyone expected and keep falling, and it\u2019s right that I as someone in charge of managing our public finances has a view on that.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b0562573b5aa4ed8b8417232293950b28bd3faf1\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0562573b5aa4ed8b8417232293950b28bd3faf1/0_147_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rishi Sunak visiting a building project at Leeds station this morning.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rishi Sunak visiting a building project at Leeds station this morning.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Danny Lawson/PA</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T10:56:06.488Z\">at 10.56am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e6a00d18f087df56e4c7207\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T09:29:35.590Z\">9.29am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Stock markets around the wall are down following President Trump\u2019s travel ban announcement.

Everything about the president \u2013 his reliance on his gut instincts in place of expertise, his overwhelming selfishness, and his unfailing tendency to lash out at others when things go wrong \u2013 make him the worst person imaginable to hold the world\u2019s most powerful job in the face of pandemic.</p> \n<p>Confronting the threat requires global cooperation, perhaps more than at any time since the second world war.

The administration has made xenophobia its defining ethos.</p> \n<p>It can stir up passions and corral votes, but railing against foreigners is useless against a virus that is indifferent to ethnicity and nationality.</p> \n<p>Slamming the gates shut is also pointless in the face of a disease that already has taken hold within. Its incidence appears lower in the US than in much of Europe so far \u2013 but almost certainly because US has barely started testing.</p> \n<p>And the US is only shutting some of its gates. <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/12/donald-trumps-eu-travel-ban-is-driven-by-politics-not-science-coronavirus&amp;sa=D&amp;source=hangouts&amp;ust=1584120160309000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGp78I9QE6o0JbAe5fmUfH6-l1Mvg\">The exclusion of the UK and non-Schengen countries like Ireland</a> from the ban makes no sense if stopping the spread of disease is really the aim.

  "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s contorted spin on the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/coronavirus-outbreak-us-trump-latest\">travel restrictions he announced</a> on Wednesday night, including pinning the blame for \u201ca foreign disease\u201d on the European Union, revealed a mind largely driven by politics and not science.</p> \n<p>The impression he sought to create was that the EU bureaucracy had let the world down by failing to take necessary steps to slow the spread of coronavirus, but the United Kingdom, legally outside the EU and physically an island, was exonerated.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe will be suspending all travel from Europe to the United States for the next 30 days,\u201d the president said, specifically adding that these restrictions would not apply to the UK, without mentioning any other exemptions.</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s greatest friend in the UK, Nigel Farage, applauded the drastic but necessary measures. \u201cThe UK is now being treated as an independent country,\u201d he tweeted. The rewards of Brexit were already being reaped, in what looked like a big win for British diplomacy and the special relationship.</p> \n<p>But the reality, once the true details of the Presidential Proclamation were released, was somewhat different.</p> \n<p>The White House briefing paper said the US was closing its borders to foreign nationals who have been in the Schengen area in the last 14 days, which would apply to any British person who had recently been in the 26-nation visa-free area.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom element--showcase\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/02/interactive-coronavirus-trackers/europe\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Five other EU countries were also excluded from the US travel ban. So if the announcement was a big win for London\u2019s diplomatic heft, the same could be said of Bucharest, Nicosia, Zagreb, Dublin and Sofia, the capitals of five EU countries outside Schengen.</p> \n<p>The reality is that no European diplomat, including in the UK foreign office, had been forewarned that Trump, after a week of mishandling the crisis, was to put the EU in the dock in a bid to try to reinsert himself at the helm of the crisis.</p> \n<p>Many explanations have been offered for why Trump presented his announcement as he did. His prejudice against the EU is well known, and targeting Schengen countries gave him a chance to exempt the US\u2019s natural allies Ireland and the UK.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/trump-coronavirus-europe-travel-suspended\">Trump's EU coronavirus travel suspension explained: who is affected and will it help?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It may be that Trump has never heard of Schengen, Luxembourg or the Schengen free travel area. His spinners thought, rather than bamboozle an American public, and possibly the president, with the complexities of EU border areas, the neater impression should be left that the EU and not Brexit Britain was being targeted.</p> \n<p>An alternative explanation is that Trump had only cursorily acquainted himself with his own announcement, and misspoke. Elsewhere in his statement he twice said that goods from Europe would also be banned, a mistake that was hastily \u201cwalked back\u201d by his briefers.</p> \n<p>It may also be that the White House itself was not very convinced at the rationale of picking on the Schengen area for exclusion. The official explanation was the Schengen area had the largest number of coronavirus cases outside China. As of 12 March, the White House said the number of cases in the 26 Schengen countries was 17,442, with 711 deaths, and showed high continuous growth in infection areas. In total, Schengen countries had exported 201 cases to 53 countries.</p> \n<p>Moreover, the free flow of people between the Schengen countries made the task of preventing the coronavirus from spreading difficult, the White House said.</p> \n<p>This ignored the <a href=\"https://content.guardianapis.com/atom/interactive/interactives/2020/03/covid-19-uk/default\">large number of cases in the UK</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/coronavirus-white-house-trump-pence-testing\">lack of virus testing in the US</a> and the fact that some Schengen area countries, such as Poland and Denmark, had already effectively closed their borders to EU citizens.</p> \n<p>Ironically, the announcement represents a headache for the UK as its transport officials try to work out whether it will become a transit hub for Europeans seeking to reach the US.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"<html><head></head><body><div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;> <h2>Callout</h2> <p>callout-coronavirus</p> </div></body></html>\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Trump, after a week as a bystander, has put his imprimatur on the coronavirus crisis, and in a way that hammers UK shares. Larry Summers, the former chief economist at the World Bank, commented: \u201cThe president has set what I believe is a new world record for presidential market value destruction. He destroys about $500bn in equity market value in course of an 11-minute speech. Destruction roughly doubles as investors take an hour to analyse the speech. Loose lips sink ships. Imprudent rhetoric sinks markets.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump has form on politically motivated but arbitrary travel bans, notably on Muslims. In January 2017 he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/27/donald-trump-muslim-refugee-ban-executive-action\">barred people from seven majority-Muslim countries</a> \u2013 Iran, Iraq, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Sudan and Libya \u2013 from entering the US for 90 days. The travel ban was later struck down as unconstitutional by the courts on the grounds that there was no rationale to have a ban that put religion at its heart. But this did not stop him from using the threat of a ban as a bargaining chip with Gulf states.</p> \n<p>In this latest ban, the guiding principle may not be religion, but animus towards an institution that challenges nationalism. Either way, the decision, and the manner in which it was taken, has left even British politicians appalled. Tom Tugendhat, the chair of the UK foreign affairs select committee, warned: \u201cHow countries work together in moments of crisis will shape how we cooperate after. This is a moment for the UK to reach out around the world to allies and friends to help coordinate action and support.\u201d</p> \n<p>The implicit criticism is that the US is not at present able to fulfil that role.</p>",
  "<p>Almost two-thirds of white evangelical Protestants in the US believe \u201ctheir side\u201d is winning politically under the Trump administration, according to a new survey.</p> <p>The proportion has increased steadily during Trump\u2019s presidency.

  "<p>Such is the reverse Midas touch of Donald Trump, that his attempt last night to face facts, steady nerves and reassure the public succeeded in spreading panic, sowing confusion and ratcheting up the anxiety.</p> <p>The fact that Trump delivered a rare, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2020/mar/12/trump-announces-travel-ban-from-europe-to-the-us-in-bid-to-stem-coronavirus-video\" title=\"\">live televised address</a> to the nation should, by itself, have induced calm.

(As recently as Tuesday, he was saying, \u201cIt will go away, just stay calm.\u201d) That he was ready to deploy one of the US presidency\u2019s most powerful tools, usually reserved for moments of war or disaster \u2013 a TV address from the Oval Office \u2013 seemed to signal that he was, at last, facing reality.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/12/us-cities-wuhan-coronavirus-covid-19\">Will American cities have a Wuhan experience? Only if they are lucky | Dr Renee C Wurth and Dr Nick Obradovich</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sure enough, when he referred to the virus as a \u201chorrible infection\u201d, after weeks spent dismissing it as a glorified cold or flu, it fed the hope that Trump might finally be ready to acknowledge that his approach up until this moment had not worked \u2013 that this was not a problem that could be dealt with in the usual away, swatted aside with a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/08/us/politics/trump-coronavirus.html\" title=\"\">tweet</a> or by hanging a comic nickname around the neck of one of his enemies.</p> <p>But no sooner had that hope appeared than it faded away. For in the course of nine minutes, Trump swiftly reverted to type. He described Covid-19 as a \u201cforeign virus\u201d, and took pains to point out that \u201ca large number of new clusters in the United States were seeded by travellers from Europe\u201d. His doctrine of \u201cAmerica first\u201d \u2013 a phrase he used once again \u2013 forever pits the US against the world, with its implication that America\u2019s purity is permanently under threat of contamination by alien hordes. Trump has used that imagery in the context of immigration for more than four years; it should hardly be a surprise that he uses it now in the context of disease.</p> <p>Equally in character was his preference for the vast, sweeping edict over the detailed, calibrated policy response. What the US needs most is a serious, extensive programme of testing. Currently, the US is bottom of the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/StewartWood/status/1238015271346020352?s=20\" title=\"\">global league</a> table for coronavirus testing, at a rate of just five people in every million. (South Korea is testing 3,692 people per million.) But that kind of announcement would require too much work, not least because Trump shut down the dedicated Obama-era, White House unit that had focused on preparedness against a global pandemic. It would be too dull and plodding for the man who made his name issuing orders on The Apprentice. Trump prefers the kingly diktat that makes instant headlines and good TV. In the 2016 campaign it was his call for a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/07/donald-trump-ban-all-muslims-entering-us-san-bernardino-shooting\" title=\"\">total and complete shutdown</a>\u201d on Muslims entering the US. This time it was a ban on travellers from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/trump-coronavirus-europe-travel-suspended\" title=\"\">26 European countries</a> in the Schengen area, starting on Friday. Once again, the would-be medieval monarch was ordering the drawbridge pulled up against the foreign menace.</p> <p>He surely hoped his subjects would be soothed by such a decisive show of leadership. But because this is Trump, his short speech was riddled with errors that had to be rapidly corrected \u2013 thereby spreading confusion rather than clarity. One example: he announced that his Europe ban would \u201capply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo\u201d across the Atlantic, prompting the White House to rush out a statement explaining that the president had got it wrong, and that the new policy would, in fact, only apply to people, not goods. If the plan was to project a White House coolly capable in the face of a crisis, that mix-up and Trump\u2019s halting discomfort in front of the teleprompter conveyed the precise opposite.</p> <p>Above all, the new policy lacked rhyme or reason. Why keep out almost all Europeans, as if this problem is exclusive to Europe (and China), rather than global, and when the US has a rising infection problem all its own? And why exempt the UK, which is hardly coronavirus-free? There was no explanation, so speculation filled the vacuum. Could it be a politically motivated swipe at the EU, which Trump once said he regarded as the US\u2019s greatest \u201cfoe\u201d, pointedly giving preferential treatment to Brexit Britain? Was it driven by a motive as base as the fact that Trump has <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/trumps-travel-ban-sidesteps-his-own-european-resorts/\" title=\"\">golf courses in the UK</a> (and Ireland), and he didn\u2019t want to harm his own businesses? Or did it spring from a crudely racist worldview that divides the globe into a clean, acceptable Anglosphere set against a tainted, diseased \u201cabroad\u201d?</p> <p>Whatever the explanation, the address did not work. The clearest proof came in the metric Trump understands best and that terrifies him most, because he believes it holds the key to his prospects of re-election.

When the Morrison government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/apr/02/coalition-federal-budget-2019-woos-low-and-middle-income-earners-with-195bn-tax-cuts-in-budget\">gave people income tax cuts</a>, they didn\u2019t spend their windfall, they saved it. So targeting one-off payments at people who lack the luxury of saving does seem the best way of sending cautious consumers to the shops to deliver the desired economic benefit.</p> <p>That strategy worked during the global financial crisis, and it is reasonable, in the broad, for Treasury to assume it can work again.</p> <p>My only question would be whether $750 is the magic number; whether that is enough money to coax people to get out and spend for Australia at a time when people are fretful enough to be stampeding into supermarkets and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/mar/07/it-isnt-mad-max-police-warning-after-shoppers-brawl-over-toilet-paper-in-sydney\">getting into punch-ups over toilet paper</a>.</p> <p>Because if we cut to the chase, the success of this package requires two things: speed of delivery and confidence in the community.</p> <p>It requires people and businesses to go out and spend their government handouts, not retreat to their bunkers like doomsday preppers.</p> <p>The problem for Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg is a circular one. As a government you can try to engender national confidence by projecting steadiness, by working up a plan and telegraphing it with as much competence as you can muster. But you are also hostage to events largely beyond your control.</p> <p>The government is hostage to people worried about whether they, or their loved ones, are going to succumb to an illness, which is a visceral fear; hostage to how and when this illness will spread, and the practical consequences of the pandemic (health systems stretched, schools and shops and businesses closing); hostage to whatever market-moving madness comes out of Donald Trump\u2019s mouth on any given day (which must be one of the adrenaline-thumping unknowns of all).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/12/what-australian-governments-coronavirus-stimulus-package-means-for-you-explainer\">What the Australian government's $17bn coronavirus stimulus package means for you</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In closing, a couple more things can be noted.</p> <p>The first is that the government has managed to land this package, and the show hasn\u2019t exploded \u2013 even though this is the Coalition, funding cash handouts to benefit recipients. This is behaviour that in more ideological quarters of the government could be considered highly suspect, even if the overarching objective is to keep people employed and the country out of recession.</p> <p>Just remember the Coalition has spent much of the last 10 years characterising fiscal stimulus, including cash payments, as budget-wrecking communism, so assuming the current discipline holds, this collective epiphany is genuinely interesting.</p> <p>It suggests that sober, expert advice and pragmatic thinking can sometimes prevail over the brimming feelings of the overconfident ignoramuses who loom large in public life and make it their business to be as destructive as possible.</p> <p>I was beginning to wonder whether hoping for sense was a waste of energy, and this stimulus package suggests to me that the technocrats, both in the political and bureaucratic class, are still in the fight.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know about you but I find this reassuring.</p> <p>The second thing to note is that the government has been sensible enough to reserve the right to do more in the event it needs to do more. It has given itself scope to go again at budget time in May if it judges a second round of stimulus is required.</p> <p>This is good scope to have, because right now, we need all options on the table.</p>",

  "<p>The coronavirus outbreak threatens to upend the organisation of the US presidential election and strike a blow to Donald Trump because of his reliance on big campaign rallies.</p> <p>Democratic rivals Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders both cancelled rallies in Cleveland, Ohio, on Tuesday, citing recommendations from public health officials to avoid assembling large indoor crowds.

He held them in crucial places that rival Hillary Clinton failed to visit in 2016. He has staged <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_post-election_Donald_Trump_rallies\">nearly a hundred of them</a> since becoming president. He appears more at ease firing up a raucous crowd than in the staid formality of Washington.</p> <p>No less importantly, the rallies have become an integral part of Trump campaign\u2019s data gathering operation. The Politico website <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/08/trump-2020-campaign-hidden-voters-123382\">noted this week:</a> \u201cNearly 31,000 people signed up to attend Donald Trump\u2019s recent campaign rally in North Charleston, South Carolina. It didn\u2019t matter that less than half of them showed up.</p> <p>\u201cThe Trump campaign kept every one of their names and plans to spend the next eight months urging them to help the president\u2019s re-election efforts \u2013 knocking on doors, donating a few dollars, attending a meetup and, most importantly, voting on election day.\u201d</p> <p>In total, Politico added, the Trump campaign has identified more than 1.4 million potential voters from their events since inauguration day 2017, including about 126,000 who did not vote in the last four elections.</p> <p>Cancelling rallies could therefore cut off this crucial data supply. Among those who fear the political consequences is the rightwing radio talkshow host Rush Limbaugh, who this week <a href=\"https://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2020/03/09/democrats-want-to-shut-down-trump-rallies/\">pushed a conspiracy theory</a> that Democrats want to stop the rallies because some of their own members have been attending them.</p> <p>\u201cThis is why they want these rallies stopped,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is why \u2013 it\u2019s not because of public safety, not because of public health. These people \u2013 because as you point out, they\u2019re not making an effort to shut down every other opportunity for people to congregate.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cIt makes perfect sense from their standpoint. If you can\u2019t beat Trump and if you want to stop the appearance of excitement about the Trump campaign, then stop the rallies. And if you\u2019re really worried that so many people attending rallies are actually Democrats, then you\u2019ve really gotta shut \u2019em down.\u201d</p> <p>The 2020 presidential election has already been buffeted by unexpected events. Senators who had planned to campaign in Iowa and New Hampshire found themselves spending the day at Trump\u2019s impeachment trial. But the coronavirus promises disruption on a grander scale for campaigns and voters.</p> <p>The MSNBC network host Chris Hayes said on Tuesday: \u201cYou think people are going to be going to the polls in Georgia in two weeks? In big public gatherings? That\u2019s an open question right now.\u201d Fellow presenter Nicolle Wallace wondered: \u201cWill there be conventions? Will there be debates? What will voting look like? Everything is up in the air.\u201d</p> <p>The \u201cCatholics for Trump\u201d event appears to be a test of whether the public will accept campaign events. Asked at a White House briefing on Tuesday whether the Trump campaign would continue to hold rallies, Vice-President Mike Pence said: \u201cThat\u2019ll be a decision that\u2019s made literally on a day-to-day basis.\u201d</p> <p>Biden\u2019s campaign, meanwhile, cancelled a get-out-the-vote event planned for Thursday in Florida, which will hold primary contests next week along with Arizona, Illinois and Ohio. The former vice-president plans instead to deliver an address in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, on Thursday regarding the US coronavirus response.</p> <p>This could give him an opportunity to appear presidential while, critics say, Trump flounders. Rallies and other public events, meanwhile, are not seen as Biden\u2019s strongpoint, so cancelling those may shield him from scrutiny and the risk of making gaffes.</p> <p>But analysts in Washington played down the significance of rallies to final election outcome. Elaine Kamarck, a senior fellow in the governance studies programme at the Brookings Institution thinktank, said: \u201cI just don\u2019t think this will matter one way or another. It\u2019s true believers that go to Trump rallies and they\u2019re not going to desert him.</p> <p>\u201cWe are talking about an electorate of 100 million or more. Whether you have 5,000 or 10,000 people at a rally makes no difference. There are probably 10 people in the United States who don\u2019t know what they think of Trump and they\u2019re so out of it they might not even bother to vote.\u201d</p> <p>John Zogby, a Democratic pollster, acknowledged: \u201cThe campaign rallies have been very important to him and he always scheduled them strategically. They give him a boost. He\u2019s a showman and this is Trump at his best.\u201d</p> <p>But he added: \u201cHe has other effective ways of communicating and he will use them. His support base will move along with these changes. The campaign are very sophisticated in their use of data and being able to adjust.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump has banned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/coronavirus-outbreak-us-trump-latest\">travel to the US from most of Europe</a> \u2013 apart from the UK and Ireland \u2013&nbsp;for 30 days in an attempt to limit the spread of the coronavirus.</p> \n<p>The move failed to stem heavy losses on financial markets and prompted one top economist to warn that a global recession was now \u201chighly probable\u201d.</p> \n<p>In a sombre primetime address from the Oval Office on Wednesday evening, the US president boasted that the travel ban and series of other measures designed to cushion the economic blow of the outbreak amounted to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/we-are-at-a-critical-time-trumps-coronavirus-speech-in-full\">the most aggressive and comprehensive effort to confront a foreign virus in history</a>\u201d.</p> \n<p>But Asian stock markets and Wall Street futures trading plunged deep into the red even as Trump laid out his plans, with investors betting that the $250bn package would not be enough to reverse the creeping shutdown of the world\u2019s largest economy.</p> \n<p>The US suspension will not apply to the United Kingdom and Ireland, and does not apply to American citizens, Trump said, as he attempted to blame the European Union for \u201cseeding\u201d hotspots in America. Confusion following Trump\u2019s address later forced officials to clarify that cargo, as well as non-Schengen countries in Europe, would also be exempt from the ban.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/coronavirus-outbreak-us-trump-latest\">Trump to suspend travel from Europe, excluding UK, amid coronavirus outbreak</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Observers said the speech, in which Trump gave the sense of resisting a foreign invasion, struck a strange tone. David Litt, who wrote speeches for Barack Obama, said: \u201cAs a former presidential speechwriter, my careful rhetorical analysis is that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/11/donald-trump-us-coronavirus-address\">he\u2019s gonna get us all killed</a>.\u201d</p> \n<p>Elsewhere, Italy saw its restrictions on daily life increase after the government ordered the closure of all shops apart from pharmacies and grocery stores and other essential stores. The whole country of 60 million people was placed into lockdown on Tuesday and is the second-worst affected nation with more than 12,000 cases.</p> \n<p>The outbreak also claimed its most high-profile cases so far when Hollywood superstar Tom Hanks announced that he and wife, Rita Wilson, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/tom-hanks-coronavirus-actor-and-wife-rita-wilson-test-positive-in-australia\">have tested positive for the coronavirus</a>.

China still accounts for the majority of victims but official figures from the country on Thursday said there had been just 15 new infections in the past 24 hours.</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p>The number of US cases has risen to more than 1,300, with the sharp increase in recent days one of the factors forcing Trump to respond more forcefully to the outbreak after consistently trying to play down the threat.</p> \n<p>But he still attempted to deflect blame, calling it a \u201cforeign\u201d virus and saying that there had been \u201cdramatically fewer cases\u201d in the US than in Europe.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe European Union failed to take the same precautions and restrict travel from China and other hotspots. As a result, a large number of new clusters in the United States were seeded by travellers from Europe,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter consulting with our top government health professionals, I have decided to take several strong but necessary actions to protect the health and wellbeing of all Americans.\u201d</p> \n<p>The US state department later issued revised guidance advising Americans to reconsider all overseas travel.</p> \n<p>The US economic measures revealed by Trump include financial relief for workers who are ill, quarantined or caring for others due to the illness, Trump said, adding that the US treasury would defer tax payments without interest or penalties for certain businesses and individuals. The financial system would be bolstered by an extra $200bn in liquidity, he said, and small businesses would be given access to more capital and liquidity.</p> \n<p>But Mohamed El-Erian, the highly respected chief economist of insurer Allianz, said such measures would not do enough to prevent the shutdown of economies across the world, which was now gripped by the \u201ceconomics of fear\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe advanced economies are now likely to feel the full force of economic sudden stops that destroy both supply and demand at the same time,\u201d he said. \u201cThe collapse in economic activity risks being amplified by the economics of fear, uncertainty and adverse economic-financial feedback loops.</p> \n<p>\u201cI believe there is a high probability of global recession.\u201d</p> \n<p>Tom Hanks\u2019 revelation that he had become infected was also seen as significant factor, given the spread of the contagion to such a well-known person.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe news about Tom Hanks will fuel uncertainty, prompting people to disengage more from economic activities,\u201d said El-Erian.</p> \n<p>His gloomy analysis was reflected in financial markets in Asia Pacific, which plummeted into full selling mode during and after Trump\u2019s address. The ASX200 in Sydney was down 7.2%, in Tokyo the Nikkei was off 5.4% and Hong Kong fell 4.3%.</p> \n<p>Shares in airlines were especially badly hit. Australia\u2019s Qantas fell 11%, Singapore Airlines was down 4%, as was Hong Kong\u2019s Cathay Pacific Brent crude oil, the international benchmark, was badly affected by new of the travel ban, falling 5.3% to $33.88.</p> \n<p>The price action pointed to more selling in Europe and the US when markets open on Thursday. The Dow Jones industrial average <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/11/us-stocks-latest-bull-to-bear-market-signs-coronavirus-impact\">entered bear market territory</a> on Wednesday \u2013 defined by a 20% fall from its most recent high \u2013 and futures trading suggested it would lose another 4.4% on Thursday. The FTSE100 is set to shed 5.8% in London.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe travel ban from Europe has definitely taken everyone by surprise,\u201d said Khoon Goh, head of Asia Research at ANZ in Singapore. \u201cAlready we know the economic impact is significant, and with this additional measure on top it\u2019s just going to multiply the impact across businesses. This is something that markets had not factored in ... it\u2019s a huge near-term economic cost.\u201d</p>",

A number of passengers on Mello\u2019s Turkish Airlines flight left with him, waiting by the airline\u2019s counter for their luggage, some on hold with customer service. <br></p> <p>\u201cThere are just so many differentials that can happen,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there is one case (of coronavirus) in Turkey, but imagine in five days they find 400 people and then they say you have to stay 14 days in quarantine. It just wouldn\u2019t be great to go for five days and then end up stuck for 30 days.\u201d<br></p> <p>Reggie Chand, 34, and Esther Goundar, 32, were flying through Istanbul to Athens for a two-week trip to celebrate their fifth wedding anniversary. <br></p> <p>\u201cWe got checked in, we got our boarding tickets from here to Turkey, from Turkey to Athens,\u201d Goundar said. \u201cWe\u2019re waiting in the lounge area and then I got a text message from my friend: \u2018Hey, are you going to get stuck in Europe?\u2019\u201d <br></p> <p>Chand and Goundar are American citizens. They did not know when they canceled the trip they had been planning since October that the ban did not apply to them, but looking back, they still think they made the right decision. \u201cIt\u2019s too much risk,\u201d Goundar said. \u201cEven if the vacation goes well, and we come back, either way you stay two weeks on vacation and then stay isolated for two weeks. It\u2019s too much.\u201d<br></p> <p>The couple felt a mixture of disappointment and anger over the whole ordeal -- Chand had been on hold with Turkish Airlines for more than an hour, looking to get a refund for their tickets. <br></p> <p>\u201cI am kind of mad,\u201d Chand said. \u201cHe could have said, OK you have two days or three days, or I\u2019m going to talk to airlines so you can have something planned so nobody is stuck in Europe. What if we had gone and we were now stuck there?\u201d<br></p> <p>\u201cThat would have pissed me off,\u201d Goundar said. \u201cIf we were already on the flight and we were told you cannot go home for the next 29 days, we would not have enjoyed our vacation.\u201d<br></p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e69af688f08c2df6d277ffe\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T03:44:13.733Z\">3.44am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The president apparently misstated a number of things</strong> during his televised address.

This does not apply to legal permanent residents, (generally) immediate family members of U.S. citizens, and other individuals who are identified in the proclamation. </i></p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e6995048f085f0b8d946e2a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-12T01:50:36.690Z\">1.50am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>The acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security has said that further guidance on the travel suspension will come within the next two days, outlining more details. </strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/DHS_Wolf/status/1237915985476227078\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The action <a href=\"https://twitter.com/POTUS?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@POTUS</a> is taking to deny entry to foreign nationals who have been in coronavirus-affected areas will keep Americans safe &amp; save lives.

As a result, the campaign is arguing that it\u2019s \u201cnearly impossible\u201d for Vermont senator Bernie Sanders to catch up to Biden\u2019s delegate lead. </p> <p>That\u2019s according to an internal campaign memo obtained by The Guardian. The memo comes a day after Biden trounced Sanders in the latest round of Democratic primary contests on Tuesday. </p> <p>\u201cVotes are still being counted, but it appears that we will net somewhere around 70-80 delegates from March 10 contests alone,\u201d the memo reads. \u201cFor context, on a day we expected would be the toughest day for us in the March calendar, we netted approximately the same number of delegates that we netted on Super Tuesday. This brings our total projected delegate lead to approximately 160.\u201d</p> <p>Sanders\u2019 path forward is precarious. He trails Biden by over 150 delegates. Biden beat Sanders in Michigan on Tuesday, the most delegate-rich state of the six and one that Sanders surprisingly won in 2016. Sanders in a press conference on Wednesday said he planned to still stay in the race but conceded the path is difficult for him. In a fundraising email to supporters, Sanders said: \u201cwe are winning \u2014 very clearly \u2014 the ideological debate, we are losing, right now, the electability debate.\u201d</p> <p>According to the memo, the Biden campaign sees the next few states as advantageous for the former vice president. \u201cThe states that vote next - Arizona, Florida, Illinois, Ohio, and Georgia - have been some of our strongest, and we expect to significantly expand our delegate lead in those highly-supportive, delegate-rich states. Of 682 delegates awarded in those states, conservative estimates have us winning more than 400 delegates and netting more than 150 delegates.\u201d</p> <p>The memo concludes: \u201cShould our broad base of support remain - and we have seen no signs that would indicate otherwise - it will be nearly impossible for Sanders to recoup his current delegate disadvantage.\u201d</p> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e69714b8f08c2df6d277e76\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-11T23:19:58.485Z\">11.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>It\u2019s unclear what, exactly, Donald Trump will say when he addresses the coronavirus threat tonight.

But they didn\u2019t agree that the Vermont senator is their best bet to beat Donald Trump. The establishment didn\u2019t lock Bernie out. Black voters across the south made the pragmatic decision that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden\">Joe Biden</a> is the man to unseat the US president. A broad coalition of voters, from suburban women to white men without a college degree, took their cue from South Carolina and flocked around Biden. It was a flood on Tuesday. Florida and Georgia are ready to pile on the bandwagon.</p> <p>Turnout is up across the nation, especially in Michigan, where Biden and not Sanders is the beneficiary. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats\">Democrats</a> are declaring they cannot tolerate any more Trump. They believe Biden can manage a panic. The wave has laid Sanders asunder.

Getting Donald Trump out of office, which is why, I suspect, primary voters went for what they see as the safe choice instead of the candidate promising free healthcare, free college, free puppies and pizza every Friday (and who\u2019s going to pay for it? Billionaires!). That, or young people were too busy making TikToks to show up.</p> <p>What I\u2019m curious about is what comes next: will the legions of young people who knocked on doors and memed their hearts out for Sanders become so disillusioned by the Democratic party that they sit out the general election, write in Bernie Sanders, lodge a protest vote for Trump or leave the party altogether?

In fact, some of the most questionable decisions of his 2020 campaign \u2013 doing a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/apr/16/bernie-sanders-draws-enthusiastic-cheers-in-surprising-fox-news-town-hall\">Fox News Town Hall</a> and touting a <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/meet-the-press/blog/meet-press-blog-latest-news-analysis-data-driving-political-discussion-n988541/ncrd1123066#blogHeader\">controversial endorsement</a> by Joe Rogan \u2013 were based on the rationale that Sanders alone could win back white working-class voters who had abandoned the Democratic party for Trump.</p> <p>Despite trailing in the polls by <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna1153246\">25%</a>, he had eked out a narrow but significant win over Hillary Clinton in the 2016 primaries.

Despite all the hype after the first three primaries, in wildly unrepresentative and largely irrelevant states, Sanders was winning by pluralities between one-quarter and one-third of the vote. In several cases his support was only half that of 2016, suggesting his surprise success last time was as much anti-Clinton protest as pro-Sanders support. Even when the field started to thin, Sanders only won a majority in his home state of Vermont, and only barely so.</p> <p>While Super Tuesday was brutal for the large size of the Biden wins, the modest Sanders wins were equally telling. Despite massive campaigning efforts in terms of both money and personnel and very favorable poll numbers for weeks, Sanders won just 34% of the vote in California. Biden, who had barely campaigned in the Golden State, came second with 27%, just seven points behind.</p> <p>Read the full piece:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/10/why-bernie-sanders-lost-michigan\">Why Bernie Sanders lost Michigan \u2013 and what it means for his campaign | Cas Mudde</a> </p> </aside> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e68ea8c8f087df56e4c6778\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-11T13:47:53.821Z\">1.47pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6418fc535385d4f9d1cb31c6c5b6f3305ca286e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6418fc535385d4f9d1cb31c6c5b6f3305ca286e/0_133_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Supporters of Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden attend a campaign rally at Renaissance High School in Detroit, Michigan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Supporters of Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden attend a campaign rally at Renaissance High School in Detroit, Michigan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Kowalsky/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9cc3c850ab6376882e40f5411cc896ddc4e1a21d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9cc3c850ab6376882e40f5411cc896ddc4e1a21d/0_0_4377_2626/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Huntington Center is seen empty after Democratic presidential candidate Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders cancels his rally planned in Cleveland, Ohio.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Huntington Center is seen empty after Democratic presidential candidate Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders cancels his rally planned in Cleveland, Ohio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Megan Jelinger/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e5fcb6c5d18cb1f45ad6032a3e6e449bd1dbb053\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e5fcb6c5d18cb1f45ad6032a3e6e449bd1dbb053/0_280_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Democratic presidential hopeful former Vice President Joe Biden speaks, flanked by his wife Jill Biden, at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Democratic presidential hopeful former Vice President Joe Biden speaks, flanked by his wife Jill Biden, at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ae97aced02c4960ba40596cf511002a6e4e1f4a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae97aced02c4960ba40596cf511002a6e4e1f4a6/0_195_5845_3507/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Volunteers take down a rally stage for Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden in Cleveland, Ohio.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Volunteers take down a rally stage for Democratic presidential candidate former Vice President Joe Biden in Cleveland, Ohio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Megan Jelinger/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e68e8668f087df56e4c6764\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/tom-perkins\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-11T13:36:17.574Z\">1.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">'Hard to comprehend\u2019: Sanders\u2019 loss in Michigan crushes staff and supporters</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In the days leading up to a must-win Tuesday Michigan primary, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders\">Bernie Sanders</a> criss-crossed the state, firing up thousands of supporters and taking the stage with star surrogates in a bid to repeat his momentum-shifting 2016 upset of Hillary Clinton.</p> <p>As the polls closed, it seemed to some that a surprise win might not be out of the question.

The next major slate of primaries is on March 17, and includes Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio. </p> <p>In <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/fl/florida_democratic_presidential_primary-6847.html\">Florida</a>, Biden is 42.5 points ahead of his rival in polling averages, while recent polling in <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2020/president/az/arizona_democratic_primary-6898.html\">Arizona</a> shows Biden at +28. Sanders lost all four states to Hillary Clinton in 2016.</p> <p>But Sanders seems unlikely to go quietly \u2013 despite his decision not to speak after the results last night. His campaign said last night that he fully intended to take on Biden in Sunday\u2019s debate in Arizona, and he still has a fiercely loyal support base, especially among the young and Latinos. </p> <p>In 2016, his decision to stay in the race all the way to the bitter end \u2013 only endorsing Clinton in July of that year \u2013 was perceived by many of his supporters as helping push Clinton\u2019s platform to the left, for example on healthcare. He may well aim to do the same with Biden this year. </p> <p>Clinton supporters, of course, bitterly resent the fact Sanders stayed in the race so long, believing it weakened her in the general election, perhaps crucially. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"301d04393146ab86f669a693fd827b20d8a79fb2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/301d04393146ab86f669a693fd827b20d8a79fb2/91_0_2839_1703/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bernie Sanders: mulling next moves.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bernie Sanders: mulling next moves.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Sancya/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e68c2418f08c2df6d277546\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-11T10:50:36.469Z\">10.50am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Donald Trump\u2019s response to last night\u2019s primary results seemed a little off the pace, continuing to blame Elizabeth Warren for Bernie Sanders\u2019 defeats:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1237603152490147850\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Pocahontas, working in conjunction with the Democrat Party, totally destroyed the campaign of Bernie Sanders.

Behind him were framed photos, including portraits of his parents, and flags and gold curtains.</p> \n<p>At 9.02pm, Trump began as presidents so often do: \u201cMy fellow Americans.\u201d But in the next breath, he reverted to his familiar us-versus-them nationalism, referring to the coronavirus outbreak \u201cthat started in China\u201d and is now spreading throughout the world. \u201cThis is the most aggressive and comprehensive effort to confront a foreign virus in modern history.\u201d Not just a virus. A <em>foreign</em> virus.</p> \n<p>The president touted his own sweeping travel restrictions on China and, far from expressing sympathy and solidarity with allies, argued the European Union \u201cfailed to take the same precautions and restrict travel from China and other hotspots. As a result, a large number of new clusters in the United States were seeded by travelers from Europe.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump announced the US will be banning travelers from many European countries to the US for the next 30 days with exemptions for Americans, permanent residents and family of US citizens who have undergone screenings and, mysteriously, the UK, despite it having a higher caseload than some other European countries. Could Brexit be the new TSA PreCheck?</p> \n<p>The president then made an awful bungle. He said \u201cthese prohibitions will not only apply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo, but various other things as we get approval\u201d. Such words could trigger global economic panic. Trump was forced to hastily clarify on Twitter: \u201c... very important for all countries &amp; businesses to know that trade will in no way be affected by the 30-day restriction on travel from Europe. The restriction stops people not goods.\u201d</p> \n<p>He went on to talk of the pathogen as if it was a foreign army or terrorist network. \u201cThe virus will not have a chance against us,\u201d he said. \u201cNo nation is more prepared or more resilient than the United States.\u201d</p> \n<p>And seen in the midst of an emergency, Trump could not resist some campaigning. \u201cBecause of the economic policies that we have put into place over the last three years, we have the greatest economy anywhere in the world by far,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis is not a financial crisis, this is just a temporary moment of time that we will overcome together as a nation and as a world.\u201d</p> \n<p>Many observers found the address unreassuring and downright weird. Susan Glasser, a staff writer from the New Yorker, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sbg1/status/1237916933619679236?s=20\">tweeted:</a> \u201cThe militaristic, nationalistic language of Trump\u2019s speech tonight is striking: a \u2018foreign virus,\u2019 keeping out China and Europe.\u201d</p> \n<p>David Litt, who wrote speeches for Obama, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/davidlitt/status/1237924132047785986?s=20\">posted:</a> \u201cAs a former presidential speechwriter, my careful rhetorical analysis is that he\u2019s gonna get us all killed.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s second Oval Office address was over in 10 minutes. Then a man off camera said: \u201cWe\u2019re clear.\u201d The president unbuttoned his jacket and exclaimed with relief: \u201cOK!\u201d</p> \n<p>To millions of viewers, it was anything but.</p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump has announced that the US would temporarily suspend most travel from the European Union, as the country reckons with the spread of coronavirus and the White House grapples with the severity of the situation.</p> \n<p>The restrictions, which would begin on Friday and last for 30 days, would not apply to US citizens or to travelers from the UK. The restrictions apply to most foreign nationals who have been in the 26 countries of the Schengen area during the 14 days before their planned arrival in the US.</p> \n<p>Trump made the announcement in <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1237841878889840642\">an Oval Office speech</a> on Wednesday evening on the federal response to what the World Health Organization has declared a global pandemic.</p> \n<p>During the rare address to the nation, Trump defended his administration\u2019s response while laying blame on the European Union for not acting quickly enough to address the \u201cforeign virus\u201d, saying US clusters had been \u201cseeded\u201d by European travelers.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe made a lifesaving move with early action on China,\u201d he said. \u201cNow we must take the same action with Europe.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump also downplayed warnings of a potential recession: \u201cThis is not a financial crisis, this is just a temporary moment of time that we will overcome as a nation and as a world,\u201d he said. <br><br>\u201cThe vast majority of Americans, the risk is very, very low,\u201d he added, but he said that older Americans should avoid travel and endorsed social distancing and avoiding large gatherings. \u201cEvery community faces different risks,\u201d he noted and encouraged Americans to listen to local officials.</p> \n<p>The president also said he would take \u201cemergency action\u201d to provide relief to workers who are affected. He said he was asking Congress for $50bn for small business loans, and he also called for \u201cimmediate\u201d payroll tax cuts.</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s speech came on a tumultuous day as cases in the US topped 1,000 and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/us-coronavirus-death-toll-states-total-cases\">number of deaths rose to 37</a>, while <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/11/us-stocks-latest-bull-to-bear-market-signs-coronavirus-impact\">fluctuations in the financial markets</a> continued and Washington strained to respond. Testifying on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, Dr Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, warned that the outbreak in the US is going to get worse.</p> \n<p>\u201cI can say we will see more cases, and things will get worse than they are right now,\u201d Fauci told the House Oversight and Reform Committee. He said it is \u201c10 times more lethal than the seasonal flu\u201d.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/donald-trump-coronavirus-response\">'A tweet can't knock over a pandemic': has Trump met his match in coronavirus?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In a statement, the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said the affected countries include: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland\u201d.</p> \n<p>The acting DHS secretary, Chad Wolf, said that guidance on the travel suspension would come within the next two days.</p> \n<p>The department also clarified that restrictions would not apply to legal permanent residents, or to most immediate family members of US citizens.

Many who planned on flying to Europe that evening had no guarantee that they would be able to return to the United States once their trips had concluded, forcing some to make last-minute calls on dream vacations.</p> \n<p>Tulio Mello, 51, was preparing to board his flight to Istanbul when his friend called and told him not to get on the plane. \u201cThey had started announcing group one,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Turkey is not one of the countries included in the travel ban, but a mixture of misinformation, panic and precaution dominated the decisions made at San Francisco\u2019s airport. A number of passengers on Mello\u2019s Turkish Airlines flight left with him, waiting by the airline\u2019s counter for their luggage, some on hold with customer service.</p> \n<p>Reggie Chand, 34, and Esther Goundar, 32, were flying through Istanbul to Athens, one of the affected countries, for a two-week trip to celebrate their fifth wedding anniversary.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe got checked in, we got our boarding tickets from here to Turkey, from Turkey to Athens,\u201d Goundar said. \u201cWe\u2019re waiting in the lounge area and then I got a text message from my friend: \u2018Hey, are you going to get stuck in Europe?\u2019\u201d</p> \n<p>Chand and Goundar are American citizens. They did not know when they cancelled the trip they had been planning since October that the ban did not apply to them, but looking back, they still think they made the right decision. \u201cIt\u2019s too much risk,\u201d Goundar said. \u201cEven if the vacation goes well, and we come back, either way you stay two weeks on vacation and then stay isolated for two weeks. It\u2019s too much.\u201d</p> \n<p>The couple felt a mixture of disappointment and anger over the whole ordeal \u2013 Chand had been on hold with Turkish Airlines for more than an hour, looking to get a refund for their tickets.</p> \n<p>Jennifer Tseeng, 36, and her husband were planning on flying to Valencia, Spain, for the Las Fallas festival. But then the festival was canceled because of coronavirus fears \u2013 and then came the travel restriction.</p> \n<p>\u201cThings are changing so quickly and you don\u2019t really know what\u2019s going to happen in the next hour or two hours,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>The couple tried calling the airline, Lufthansa, but the customer service line was overrun, Tseeng said. They ended up driving to the airport to cancel their flight to Spain in person, but after Tseeng canceled the flight, they learned that the rule did not apply to American citizens like them.</p> \n<p>In the end, they felt it was best that they postponed their trip for now. \u201cIn one day, the whole situation completely changed,\u201d Tseeng said. \u201cWe just don\u2019t want to risk not being able to come back.\u201d</p> \n<p><em>Agencies contributed reporting</em></p>"
