Asked about Obama \u201cslamming\u201d the administration for its response to the coronavirus outbreak, he said: \u201cI think President Obama should have kept his mouth shut.</p> <p>\u201cYou know, we know he doesn\u2019t like much this administration is doing. That\u2019s understandable. But I think it\u2019s a little bit classless frankly to critique an administration that comes after you.</p> <p>\u201cYou had your shot. You were there for eight years. I think the tradition that the Bushes set up of not critiquing the president who comes after you is a good tradition.\u201d</p> <p>There is indeed a tradition of former presidents not commenting on or attacking their successors in the Oval Office, but Trump is, to put it lightly, not part of the informal club which currently includes Obama, George W Bush*, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter and has regularly attacked those who went before.</p> <p>Plus, Obama\u2019s views of Trump are pretty well known, if by indirect routes. For example, in a Hulu documentary about Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign against Trump, the Virginia senator Tim Kaine is seen to say the then president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/27/obama-warned-trump-fascist-2016-hulu-film-hillary-clinton-sundance\">thinks Trump is a fascist</a>.</p> <p>In the remarks leaked to Yahoo News, Obama said he would be hitting the campaign trail for Joe Biden this fall. Biden leads Trump in swing states and national polls and Obama is a proven campaigner, to say the least. McConnell is presiding over a Republican Senate majority that looks increasingly at risk. Everything is politics, folks.</p> <p><em>*Fun George W Bush note: the 43rd president is widely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/may/30/sidney-blumenthal-abraham-lincoln-donald-trump\">reported</a>, while on the podium at Trump\u2019s inauguration, to have leant over to a neighbour after the new president\u2019s dystopian \u201cAmerican Carnage\u201d speech and labelled it \u201csome weird shit\u201d.

On Tuesday, with neatly cut hair, grey suit jacket, blue shirt and blue tie, it was the real thing sitting in a busy office, a big plant outside his window, books piled high. Another man was briefly visible in an adjoining room but, perhaps after seeing himself on TV, soon disappeared.</p> <p>Fauci did not offer the searing denunciation of Donald Trump some craved. But in his diplomatic way, he offered plenty of reality checks and coded rebukes to the president\u2019s headlong rush to reopen.</p> <p>What are the dangers of reopening too quickly without following task force guidelines, he was asked.</p> <p>\u201cMy concern is that if some areas, city, states, or what have you, jump over those various checkpoints, and prematurely open up without having the capability of being able to respond effectively and efficiently, my concern is that we will start to see little spikes that might turn into outbreaks \u2026 The consequences could be really serious.\u201d</p> <p>And as Trump has claimed more than once, is the virus going to disappear? \u201cThat is just not going to happen.\u201d</p> <p>During Fauci\u2019s testimony, Rand Paul, bearded, rocked back and forth in his chair with hands folded. When his turn came, he indulged in some media bashing and, like a man trying to win a pub argument, insisted people who have recovered from the virus are probably immune. Paul has recovered and does not wear a mask.

Lawyers for Trump and attorneys for Democrats in Congress and prosecutors in New York presented their arguments by telephone. The world listened in.</p> <p>Trump did not release his tax returns during the 2016 election and has not done so since, despite promising to do so.</p> <p>\u201cPresident Trump is the first one to refuse to do that,\u201d Ginsburg said.</p> <p>Every president since Nixon, who was elected in 1968, had released tax information. But there is no legal compulsion to do so.</p> <p>Democrats in Congress are attempting to establish whether Trump is breaking ethics laws and constitutional safeguards against profiting from the presidency.</p> <p>The New York prosecutor Cyrus Vance Jr wants to find out if hush money payments to women who claimed affairs with Trump involved illegal business practices.</p> <p>Trump is asking the justices to put an end to subpoenas for tax, bank and other financial records which seek information from Deutsche Bank, Capital One and the Mazars USA accounting firm.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s lawyers, supported by the justice department, contend that he should not be so constrained by Congress and cannot be prosecuted while in office.</p> <p>Opponents of the president say he is simply not above the law.</p> <p>Appellate courts in Washington and New York have ruled that the documents should be turned over. Those courts brushed aside the president\u2019s broad arguments, focusing on the fact that the subpoenas were addressed to third parties asking for records of Trump\u2019s business and financial dealings as a private citizen, not as president.</p> <p>Rulings against Trump could result in the release of damaging information during his campaign for re-election.</p> <p>According to practice, Chief Justice John Roberts spoke first. The other justices asked questions in order of seniority. Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, Trump\u2019s two appointees to the 5-4 conservative majority, went last.</p> <p>Roberts asked Trump lawyer Patrick Strawbridge: \u201cDo you concede any power in the House to subpoena personal papers of the president?\u201d</p> <p>The Trump attorney said it was \u201cdifficult to imagine\u201d a situation in which that would be justified.</p> <p>However, in 1974 the justices acted unanimously in requiring Nixon to turn over White House tapes to the Watergate special prosecutor. And in 1997, another unanimous decision allowed a sexual harassment lawsuit to proceed against Clinton.</p> <p>In those cases, three Nixon appointees and two Clinton appointees, respectively, voted against the president who chose them. Ginsburg and Breyer were those Clinton appointees.</p> <p>For the justice department, Jeffrey Wall said allowing the House subpoenas would lead to presidents being \u201charassed\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe potential to harass and undermine the president \u2026 is plain,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is not much to ask that before the House delves into the president\u2019s personal life it explains in some meaningful way what laws it is considering and why it needs the president\u2019s documents in particular. The subpoenas here don\u2019t even come close.\u201d</p> <p>Gorsuch expressed concern about lawmakers abusing the subpoena process and hunting for unlawful conduct by political rivals.</p> <p>Speaking to congressional lawyer Douglas Letter, Samuel Alito said: \u201cIn your view, there\u2019s no protection for the purpose of preventing harassment of a president.\u201d</p> <p>But the conservatives on the court were not in uniform sympathy with the arguments presented by Trump\u2019s lawyers.</p> <p>Kavanaugh asked: \u201cThe question \u2026 boils down to how can we both protect the House\u2019s interest in obtaining information it needs to legislate but also protect the presidency. How can the court balance those interests?\u201d</p> <p>Gorsuch questioned why the court would give Trump immunity in a criminal investigation when it did not give Clinton immunity in a sexual harassment lawsuit. In the 1997 case, lawyers for the plaintiff wanted Clinton to be questioned, Gorsuch noted, while in the Trump case the information is sought from third parties.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/12/what-is-obamagate-and-why-is-trump-so-worked-up-about-it\">What is 'Obamagate' and why is Trump so worked up about it?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sekulow responded that criminal cases result in a loss of liberty and are very different from civil lawsuits that could lead to monetary damages.</p> <p>Alito challenged Sekulow\u2019s assertion that a grand jury subpoena cannot be enforced against a sitting president in a case in which waiting for a president to leave office would undermine a criminal prosecution.</p> <p>Kagan, meanwhile, noted that where personal records are concerned, \u201cthe president is just a man\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhat it seems to me you\u2019re asking us to do,\u201d she told Strawbridge, \u201cis to put a kind of 10-ton weight on the scales between the president and Congress, and essentially to make it impossible for Congress to perform oversight and to carry out its functions.\u201d</p> <p>A ruling is likely within weeks.</p>",

  "<p>In early March, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/feb/27/diana-quick-the-big-meal-brideshead\">Diana Quick</a> tripped on the strap of a bag and broke her kneecap. She was alone in north London and decided she\u2019d be better off hunkering down in her countryside home after hearing murmurs of the Covid-19 lockdown. So later that month, \u201ca friend drove me to Suffolk and left me here\u201d.</p> <p>It means her lockdown began early but it has got easier. Her knee is on the mend, she has planted vegetables in the garden and she has been joined in Suffolk by her daughter, Mary Nighy, and her family. (Mary\u2019s father is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/bill-nighy\">Bill Nighy</a>, Quick\u2019s former long-term partner.)</p> <p>\u201cI feel privileged,\u201d she says. \u201cI have a large garden with the family and the dog around me. I have some friends who are on their own. I spoke to one and he said, \u2018What I really want is a cuddle.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>It has been a surprisingly productive period, despite the knee brace and crutches. Quick plays the lead in a drama, streamed by the <a href=\"https://www.donmarwarehouse.com/\">Donmar Warehouse</a> this week, that chimes with our state of isolation. Midnight Your Time is a one-woman play by Adam Brace, about a retired lawyer who is at home and having a remote, one-way conversation with her daughter, in Palestine, through video messages.</p> <p>Quick first performed the role in 2011, directed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2018/jun/07/donmar-warehouse-michael-longhurst-new-artistic-director\">Michael Longhurst</a>, now the artistic director of the Donmar. This time they have worked together remotely, with Quick using a webcam. The role has resonated with her: <strong>\u201c</strong>As a mother, I relate in ways, having been through the empty-nest experience and also around saying, \u2018Sorry, I\u2019m in the wrong\u2019 as a mother.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3288db7d28c9b07039fea36b241e886493a7a2f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3288db7d28c9b07039fea36b241e886493a7a2f9/0_0_1110_700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Diana Quick in the online version of Midnight Your Time.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"631\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Diana Quick in the online version of Midnight Your Time.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Donmar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are things to be learned from lockdown, she thinks, particularly when it comes to the climate. Quick has backed the Green Party (she endorsed Caroline Lucas\u2019s parliamentary candidacy in the 2015 election) and thinks this period could, at best, inspire a long-term re-evaluation of the way we run the planet, as well as our own lives. She has been campaigning against proposed plans for a new nuclear power station at Sizewell, on the Suffolk coast.</p> <p>Quick comments on how the lockdown has enabled some people to slow down and appreciate nature. \u201cAnd people who have been rushing around too much have maybe found that they can manage with a lot less than they thought they needed \u2013 or that they need different things.\u201d</p> <p>Quick\u2019s work as an actor has ranged far beyond her best-known role as Lady Julia Flyte, in the 1981 TV adaptation of Brideshead Revisited. Now 72, she was working on a new sci-fi Netflix show, The White Horse, when the pandemic brought a stop to filming, and was also adapting a Wilkie Collins novel, Jezebel\u2019s Daughter.<strong> </strong>\u201cIt\u2019s a rip-roaring tale with a very strong woman at its centre. It deals with care and madness and not locking people up but having them in society.\u201d</p> <p>Her career started early \u2013 she was heavily involved in youth theatre by the age of 17 and became the first female president of the Oxford University Dramatic Society. Youth theatre gave her a head start, she says, and she performed alongside Terry Jones, Michael Palin and Annabel Leventon at Oxford.</p> <p>Motherhood came at the age of 37. <strong>\u201c</strong>I was the main breadwinner when Mary was little. If work involved going away, only one of us [Quick or Bill Nighy] would go. Of course, this meant turning down some jobs, although Mary would probably say I was absent a lot. I had that usual thing of getting up early and going to bed late so that you\u2019re frazzled.\u201d Her generation of men, she adds, were not invested in doing the housework. \u201cWe had to ask. The effect for me was that I became ingenious at finding paid work so that I could then pay people to do the things that I didn\u2019t have time do to.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cc9bf6270bb3c44bc71747fdc81782eee9f0cabc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc9bf6270bb3c44bc71747fdc81782eee9f0cabc/0_0_2466_2168/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Quick in Midnight Your Time at the HighTide festival in 2011.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"879\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Quick in Midnight Your Time at the HighTide festival in 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bill Knight</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She now has a grandchild, with another on the way. Being a grandmother is great, she says, \u201cbut not something I was longing for. I\u2019ve been very happy being a mother, enjoying my daughter\u2019s life as a grownup. When she told me she was pregnant for the first time, I thought I was too young to be a grandmother, although I wasn\u2019t really.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2020/may/14/midnight-your-time-review-diana-quick-donmar-warehouse-online-theatre\">Midnight Your Time review \u2013 Diana Quick's quietly tragic portrait of motherhood</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Mary is also an actor and film-maker now, although Quick and Bill Nighy advised her not to follow in their footsteps. \u201cWe both said, \u2018Only do it if you can\u2019t not do it\u2019 and \u2018Don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be an easy ride.\u2019\u201d But Mary is, she says, \u201cvery gifted\u201d and things worked out. <strong>\u201c</strong>She\u2019s doing amazingly well. She\u2019s had a really good year of work and is back to having a baby again, but I also see that it\u2019s a constant juggle.\u201d</p> <p>Have things got easier for women in her industry? Quick has always been engaged with feminism and feels that the gains of second-wave feminism have led to improvements in the workplace, but there is still the Sisyphean struggle to fit motherhood into a career. \u201cFemale directors were a rarity when I started out and things have improved a lot, but many of the final choices are still being [made] by male executives. And there is still the same old problem of work-life balance when children come along.

That\u2019s the issue at the heart of Trump\u2019s attempts to gin up an \u201cObamagate\u201d scandal, which on Tuesday morning he again claimed \u201cmakes Watergate look small time!\u201d</p> \n<p>Obama also said the response to the coronavirus pandemic had been \u201can absolute chaotic disaster\u201d.</p> \n<p>McConnell was <a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/497239-mcconnell-obama-should-have-kept-his-mouth-shut-on-trumps-coronavirus\">speaking</a> to Trump\u2019s daughter-in-law Lara Trump in an online fundraiser on Monday night.</p> \n<p>Asked about Obama \u201cslamming\u201d the administration for its response to the coronavirus outbreak, he said: \u201cI think President Obama should have kept his mouth shut.</p> \n<p>\u201cYou know, we know he doesn\u2019t like much this administration is doing. That\u2019s understandable. But I think it\u2019s a little bit classless frankly to critique an administration that comes after you.\u201d</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cYou had your shot. You were there for eight years. I think the tradition that the Bushes set up of not critiquing the president who comes after you is a good tradition.\u201d</p> \n<p>There is a tradition of former presidents not commenting on or attacking their successors in the Oval Office, but Trump is not part of the informal club which currently includes Obama, George W Bush, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter, and he has regularly attacked those who went before him.</p> \n<p>Plus, Obama\u2019s views of Trump are pretty well known, if usually by indirect routes and leaks to the press. For example, in a Hulu documentary about Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign against Trump, the Virginia senator Tim Kaine is seen to say the then president thinks Trump is a fascist.</p> \n<p>In the remarks leaked to Yahoo News, Obama said he would be hitting the campaign trail for Joe Biden this fall to help him try to unseat Trump and make him a one-term president. Biden leads Trump in key swing states and national polling and McConnell is also presiding over a Senate majority that now looks increasingly at risk as Republican popularity dips.</p>",

But though Democrats <a href=\"https://laist.com/2020/05/05/black_voters_disenfranchised_special_election.php\">complained</a> that the lack of a polling location in Lancaster would harm minority voters, officials added the additional location after R Rex Parris, the city\u2019s Republican mayor, requested it.</p> <p>Though he thinks it\u2019s dangerous to vote in person during the Covid-19 pandemic, Parris told the Guardian he made the request after realizing a nearby city had two polling locations, while his city had none. While he believes elections can be rigged and understood why it might have appeared that way to Trump, he said adding the polling location was not a Democratic power grab.</p> <p>\u201cI gotta take the rap. I called them up and said I want a vote center, so they gave it to me,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The California accusations underscore how the president could take advantage of the way voting procedures are rapidly changing in response to Covid-19 and question the legitimacy of election results in November.</p> <p>While Trump has long railed, <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/issues/ensure-every-american-can-vote/vote-suppression/myth-voter-fraud\">without evidence</a>, that elections are tainted by voter fraud, the increased focus on vote-by-mail amid the pandemic could offer a new thread for him to pull on to undermine confidence in elections this year. Several studies have shown voter fraud is not a widespread problem.</p> <p>\u201cGiven that the president has been making unsubstantiated voter fraud comments for years, I expect that these comments will continue,\u201d said Richard Hasen, a professor of election law at the University of California, Irvine. \u201cThe comments are very worrisome because they increase the chances that the president\u2019s supporters would not accept the election results as legitimate should he lose in November.\u201d</p> <p>Hasen and other experts helped author <a href=\"https://www.law.uci.edu/faculty/full-time/hasen/2020ElectionReport.pdf\">a report </a>last month offering guidance on how to shore up confidence in the results of the 2020 election. The recommendations include getting states to develop emergency contingency plans well in advance and educating the public that election results might not be available on election night as officials count mailed-in ballots.</p> <p>Democrats and Republicans are already <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/30/america-voting-rights-vote-by-mail-republicans\">fighting over</a> how aggressively to expand efforts to vote by mail in November, but the fight over the availability of in-person voting is likely to continue to be an explosive issue. Faced with poll worker shortages and concerns about in-person gathering, election officials have severely cut back in-person voting. Parties and campaigns are likely to aggressively fight over which polling places close and where the new ones are placed.</p> <p>\u201cAll of those changes allow for someone frankly who wants to undermine our faith in the election system to say \u2018look at what they\u2019re doing to you. This is a corrupt system,\u2019\u201d said Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles.</p> <p>\u201cCertainly whenever there\u2019s a change in how we vote I think it can be unsettling for people, and they can question whether or not they can have faith in the system, and President Trump has seized that opening.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>On Tuesday morning the supreme court will assemble via conference call to hear oral arguments in <a href=\"https://qz.com/1854264/will-the-us-supreme-court-let-trump-keep-his-many-secrets/\">three cases</a> involving President Donald Trump\u2019s claimed right to keep his taxes and financial records secret. These are in fact this generation\u2019s most important tests of the nature and limits of presidential prerogative.</p> <p>One case <a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/trump-v-vance/\">arises</a> out of the efforts of the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus Vance, to obtain tax records and other financial information from the Trump Organization as part of a grand jury investigation. More particularly, it <a href=\"https://www.theusconstitution.org/litigation/trump-v-vance/\">raises the question</a> of whether the president can refuse to comply with Vance\u2019s subpoena in order to shield those records.</p> <p>The other two <a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/trump-v-mazars/\">involve</a> the question of whether a congressional committee has the legal power to subpoena Trump\u2019s accountant and some of his lenders.</p> <p>President Trump\u2019s term in office has been marked by repeated <a href=\"https://forensicnews.net/2019/10/28/stonewalled-the-numbers-behind-the-trump-administrations-refusal-to-cooperate/\">refusals</a> to comply with subpoenas, whether from law enforcement officials or from congressional oversight committees. He also used this <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/trump-impeachment-inquiry/white-house-refuses-turn-over-documents-democrats-impeachment-inquiry-n1063771\">strategy of defiance</a> to frustrate Congress\u2019s impeachment investigation.</p> <p>His insistence that he does not have to follow the rule of law is perfectly in keeping with his <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/07/trump-rnc-speech-alone-fix-it/492557/\">assertion</a> during the last Republican national convention, that \u201cI alone\u201d can fix America\u2019s problems and with his outrageous belief, as he <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2016/01/23/trump_i_could_stand_in_the_middle_of_fifth_avenue_and_shoot_somebody_and_i_wouldnt_lose_any_voters.html\">said</a> later in the campaign, that \u201cI could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn\u2019t lose any voters.\u201d</p> <p>Trump has taken this inflated view of his importance into the Oval Office, recently <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/us/coronavirus-updates.html\">claiming</a> that he had total authority to supersede governors in dealing with the current pandemic and that the constitution\u2019s article II, which defines the executive branch\u2019s powers, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/07/23/trump-falsely-tells-auditorium-full-teens-constitution-gives-him-right-do-whatever-i-want/\">means</a> that he can \u201cdo whatever\u201d he wants.</p> <p>The president is supported by an attorney general who <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney-general-william-p-barr-delivers-19th-annual-barbara-k-olson-memorial-lecture\">believes</a> in the so-called \u201cunitary executive\u201d theory: the fate of the country, on this theory, depends on virtually unchecked presidential power.</p> <p>On Tuesday, in the New York case, the president\u2019s lawyer, Jay Sekulow who also represented Trump during the Senate impeachment trial, will make the breathtaking argument that the supreme court should recognize what he calls \u201c<a href=\"https://americanlegalnews.com/trump-new-york-and-dc-tax-cases-heading-for-the-supreme-court/\">temporary absolute immunity</a>\u201d. That he will be joined in this argument by Noel J Francisco, solicitor general of the United States, is further indication of the complicity of the attorney general, William Barr, in this effort to create an environment in which this president can behave with impunity.</p> <p>In their view, article II and the supremacy clause, mean not only that the president cannot be indicted or put on trial for committing a crime, but also that he cannot be subject to any criminal investigation during his term in office.</p> <p>In the other two cases, the president\u2019s lawyers will <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/04/is-trump-above-the-law-supreme-court-case\">contend</a> that the constitution limits Congress\u2019s authority to investigate the president.</p> <p>And, as if these theories of presidential immunity were not extreme enough, Trump\u2019s lawyers will try to persuade the court that the constitution immunizes not only the president himself but also the businesses that he owned before becoming president as well as people they hire to handle their financial affairs.</p> <p>The president\u2019s lawyers <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2019/10/23/second_circuit_court_of_appeals_trump_v_vance_oral_argument.html?spot_im_comment_id=sp_v0xu5oCZ_531871_c_MOcgFb&amp;spotim_referrer=newsfeed\">made</a> these same claims before the federal district court for the southern district of New York and second circuit court of appeals, neither of which were <a href=\"https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca2/19-3204/19-3204-2019-11-04.html\">persuaded</a> of the wisdom and legality of these positions. Courts in the District of Columba also <a href=\"https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/cadc/19-5142/19-5142-2019-10-11.html\">ruled</a> against the president in his dispute with Congress.</p> <p>All of those courts were unpersuaded because the applicable legal precedents do not line up in Trump\u2019s favor. Two cases seem particularly relevant.</p> <p>In 1974, a unanimous supreme court <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/418/683/#tab-opinion-1950929\">ruled</a> that \u201cexecutive privilege\u201d (the right to withhold information from other branches of the government to protect confidential communications within the executive branch) could not be invoked to permit presidential non-compliance with a grand jury subpoena. President Richard Nixon, from whom Trump recently <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-learned-from-nixon-not-to-fire-people-tape-conversations-2020-5\">said</a> that he had learned a lot, had to surrender documents and tapes pertaining to the possible criminal conduct of members of his staff during the Watergate affair.</p> <p>Chief Justice Warren Burger, whom Nixon appointed to the court, spoke for all the justices when he said that \u201cthe allowance of the privilege to withhold evidence that is demonstrably relevant in a criminal trial would cut deeply into the guarantee of due process of law and gravely impair the basic function of the court.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The court has experienced both a deepening of partisanship and an emboldening of its conservative majority</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Twenty-three years later, in 1997, the supreme court returned to the question of the scope of presidential immunity. In <a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1996/95-1853\">Clinton v</a><a href=\"https://www.oyez.org/cases/1996/95-1853\"> Jones</a> it again decided unanimously that a president, this time Bill Clinton, could be forced to testify in a civil case during his term in office.</p> <p>Because of the strengths of these precedents, some commentators confidently <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/08/opinion/supreme-court-trump-executive-privilege.html\">predict</a> that the court will rule against President Trump.</p> <p>But a lot has happened in the supreme court since the United States v Nixon and Clinton v Jones decisions. The court <a href=\"https://stanfordpolitics.org/2016/01/07/troubling-partisanship-supreme-court/\">has experienced</a> both a deepening of partisanship and an emboldening of its conservative majority. Moreover, in several areas, the John Roberts court <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/12/why-john-roberts-might-not-constrain-trump/602773/\">has been eager</a> to defer to presidential power.</p> <p>In the face of these developments, the chief justice has tried to convince observers of his investment in and concern about the court\u2019s institutional legitimacy. Thus he memorably <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/john-roberts-said-there-are-no-trump-judges-or-obama-judges-clarence-thomas-didnt-get-the-memo/2019/06/28/00ec5db0-99c6-11e9-8d0a-5edd7e2025b1_story.html\">spoke out</a> when President Trump impugned the integrity of a ninth circuit court of appeals judge calling him an \u201cObama judge\u201d.</p> <p>Roberts responded by insisting that \u201cWe do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges \u2026 [only] dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.\u201d</p> <p>The outcome of the cases argued on Tuesday <a href=\"https://www.dailyrepublic.com/all-dr-news/opinion/state-national-columnists/commentary-trump-tax-return-case-hinges-on-justice-roberts/\">hinges</a> on the chief justice\u2019s willingness to make good on those words when the stakes for the future of America\u2019s constitutional design are high. It will also depend on his skill in marshaling the court to join him.</p> <p>The stakes in the cases are heightened by the failed effort to impeach the president and remove him from office. Having survived that effort to hold him accountable for obstruction of Congress and abuse of power, Trump is all the more emboldened in 2020. If he were to prevail in the current cases, little would be left of America\u2019s vaunted system of checks and balances. The country would inch closer to the fulfillment of Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/lazy-authoritarian/609937/\">authoritarian designs</a>.</p> <p>The president <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/lazy-authoritarian/609937/\">has worked hard</a> to appoint to the supreme court justices and to other federal courts Trump-friendly judges, believing that they would provide legal cover for his often corrupt arrogation and abuse of power. Tuesday will provide an important glimpse into the justices\u2019 thinking and a chance to see whether they will muster the wisdom, courage and commitment to prove him wrong, and to defend the rule of law.</p>",
  "<p>President Donald Trump\u2019s incompetent handling of the Covid-19 pandemic is not only exacerbating the death and destruction caused by the virus in the US. It is also crippling the global response to the crisis, and the costs could be even deadlier.</p> \n<p>When global crises hit, American leadership is essential. Whether it was launching the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (<a href=\"https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/fact-sheet/the-u-s-presidents-emergency-plan-for/\">Pepfar</a>) or marshaling efforts to respond to the 2014 Ebola outbreak, the US has played a central role in tackling many of the world\u2019s deadliest health crises. American leadership is far from perfect, but it is necessary to tackle threats of a global magnitude.</p> \n<p>This pandemic is one of the greatest challenges the world has faced since the second world war. America has lost more people to Covid-19 than it has lost in all of its military conflicts since the beginning of the Vietnam war. The outbreak has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives around the <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">world</a>, and the crisis has just begun. As the death toll rises and the path out of the pandemic remains uncertain, the economic catastrophe will be enormous.</p> \n<p>A successful global effort to defeat the pandemic will require a robust American response. Instead, Trump is making it harder for the world to address the crisis.</p> \n<p>Trump does not seem to recognize that the only effective solution to the pandemic is to counter it everywhere. Without a universally administered vaccine, the virus could continue to cycle through country after country. And as desperate as the situation is in the US, other countries could fare far worse. The UN recently <a href=\"https://www.voanews.com/covid-19-pandemic/un-appeals-nearly-7-billion-coronavirus-aid-poorest-nations\">tripled</a> its assessment of the immediate need for aid to the most vulnerable and said trillions of dollars in rescue packages would be <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/03/1060612\">necessary</a> for developing economies. In addition to the unimaginable number of people who could die from the virus itself, the pandemic could cause famines of \u201c<a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/04/1062272\">biblical proportions</a>\u201d, according to the World Food Programme, and an economic collapse that could cost countless more lives.</p> \n<p>While the US would normally be leading calls for assistance to developing countries to help them deal with the pandemic, the Trump administration is <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/security/news/2020/04/15/483094/protect-coronavirus-pandemic-home-u-s-must-also-help-beyond-borders/\">barely noticing</a> the desperate need around the world. In past crises, the US would gather allies and partners to develop common solutions; this time, the Trump administration <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/us-scuppers-g20-coronavirus-statement-on-strengthening-who\">blocked</a> the G20 from taking action.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Trump has stood in the way of efforts to aid those who could be devastated by the pandemic</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Trump has attacked the primary international governmental organization dedicated to responding to pandemics. Early in the outbreak, long before Trump claimed that the virus would \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/14/trump-coronavirus-alerts-disinformation-timeline\">disappear</a>\u201d, the World Health Organization (WHO) was <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/30-01-2020-statement-on-the-second-meeting-of-the-international-health-regulations-(2005)-emergency-committee-regarding-the-outbreak-of-novel-coronavirus-(2019-ncov)\">sounding</a> the alarm and warning countries to prepare. But instead of working with the WHO, the Trump administration has turned the organization into a battleground with China and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/coronavirus-trump-halts-funding-to-world-health-organization\">halted</a> US funding.</p> \n<p>Trump has stood in the way of efforts to aid those who could be devastated by the pandemic. When the UN secretary general pushed for a global <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/03/1059972\">ceasefire</a> during the pandemic \u2013 which numerous groups involved in armed conflicts indicated they would <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2020/04/28/coronavirus-un-secretary-wants-global-cease-fire-amid-pandemic/5163972002/\">support</a> \u2013 the US held up efforts because of squabbling with China over language referring to the WHO. Meanwhile, the Trump administration has continued to pressure Iran and Venezuela with sanctions despite how vulnerable their people are.</p> \n<p>Trump seems to view the race for a vaccine as a zero-sum game. In March, he <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/15/world/europe/cornonavirus-vaccine-us-germany.html\">reportedly</a> tried to buy a German company that had made progress in developing a vaccine, with the intent of securing credit and access for the US. On 4 May, leaders from around the world convened to raise funds to find a vaccine and treatments and clear the way for mass production and distribution. But the US was <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/04/world/europe/eu-coronavirus-vaccine.html\">missing</a> in action \u2013 not only did Trump fail to attend, but the US didn\u2019t even send an official or any funds.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b1b6094b-4353-4b1f-98f8-896590e3f2c2\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gDPa1I4HVAY?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>One of the threads running through all this is a deadly US-China blame game. Since the Chinese Communist party (CCP) initially responded to the outbreak by trying to censor those speaking out about it, many in the US <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/31/us-china-coronavirus-diplomacy\">blame</a> China for allowing the pandemic to spread. Whatever culpability China deserves, no one gains right now from a US-China feud over the pandemic at the expense of collective efforts to beat the disease. Yet that\u2019s exactly what the Trump administration and the CCP are doing.</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s deadly mishandling of the pandemic at home also threatens to make the world\u2019s most powerful country an international pariah. With more cases and deaths than any other country, and with a president who seems uninterested in doing what it takes to safely reopen the economy, the rest of the world is unlikely to take American policies for addressing the pandemic seriously. Even worse, as other countries begin to safely reopen their economies, the US may become the target of travel bans, as China was early in the pandemic.</p> \n<p>In moments of global crisis, America is still the indispensable nation. But in today\u2019s moment of need, Trump is making America an obstacle to success.</p>",
  "<p>There\u2019s a moment near the end of most sports movies when the coach gives a heartfelt pep talk right before the crucial game. The coach will use words like \u201cheart,\u201d \u201chonor,\u201d and \u201cteamwork\u201d. Everything that happens on the court or field after that is a bit of a letdown because victory \u2013 whether on the scoreboard or of the spirit \u2013 seems inevitable after the speech. To movie audiences, these moments may seem corny, but in real life, when someone you admire and respect speaks, their words can have a great impact. I certainly listened when coaches I respected, <a href=\"https://www.wbur.org/onlyagame/2018/05/25/kareem-abdul-jabbar-coach-wooden-book\">such as John Wooden</a>, spoke at crucial points during my career. Inspiring people to be their best is what great coaches \u2013 and great politicians \u2013 do. It\u2019s one of the qualities that makes them great.</p> <p>For the past few months, this country has faced a formidable opponent in Covid-19. It\u2019s been kicking our butts across every state and the statistics are only getting worse. America has a deep bench of expertise and we know how to come together as a team when we need to. Yet, faced with uncomfortable truths and frightening inconsistencies in leadership, we\u2019ve started to unravel here and there. Rather than pull together in a crisis, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/03/michigan-gretchen-whitmer-lockdown-protest-racism\">we\u2019re fighting each other</a>. And that\u2019s leading to even more deaths.</p> <p>One thing we could use right now is a passionate rallying speech from our president that inspires us all to do the right thing, not just for ourselves, but for our country. It is the speech Trump should deliver, not because he wants to be reelected, but because it would address the country\u2019s major concerns, end the political squabbling, provide a reasonable plan going forward, and give Americans confidence that their government is working to protect their health and economic concerns. It needs to be the speech of a statesman not a, well, Trump. If I were Trump\u2019s speechwriter, using the lessons I learned from great talks I heard in my basketball career, this is what I would give him to deliver:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/apr/15/the-way-americans-regard-sports-heroes-versus-intellectuals-speaks-volumes\">The way Americans regard sports heroes versus intellectuals speaks volumes | Kareem Abdul-Jabbar</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cAmerica has faced many enemies before, both foreign and domestic. The goal of those enemies has always been to destroy not just America itself, but the ideal America stands for, which is equal treatment and opportunity for all who live here, regardless of wealth, ethnic background, religion, sexual orientation, or gender. Covid-19 is an enemy that doesn\u2019t care about politics or social justice \u2013 it\u2019s an opportunistic organism that just wants to feed and spread. It doesn\u2019t want to destroy America. But if we\u2019re not careful, it might achieve that anyway.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are defined by how they act, not during the good times when kindness and compassion are easy, but during the tough times, when helping a neighbor could cost us. A crisis reveals whether we are heroes or villains. Ernest Hemingway said, \u2018Courage is grace under pressure,\u2019 and I believe that Americans are ready to demonstrate their courage through grace.</p> <p>\u201cThat has to start with those of us in government who are entrusted with the task of fighting this enemy. The only way we can justify the people\u2019s trust is by being completely transparent in our mistakes, successes, and plans for the future.</p> <p>\u201cWe have made mistakes. My administration did not act quickly enough in recognizing the serious threat that Covid-19 posed. We should have, but we didn\u2019t. No excuse is offered because no excuse is acceptable. That delay led to a domino effect of playing catch-up in developing enough testing and in getting necessary medical supplies to health care facilities. But we have learned from our mistakes and those of other countries as well.</p> <p>\u201cThe virus has worsened already unacceptable racial and economic disparity in this country. The death rate among the black and Latinx communities <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/25/coronavirus-racial-disparities-african-americans\">is significantly higher than among white communities</a>. I will do everything in my power to change that. The virus is also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/10/us-election-coronavirus-voting-trump-biden\">attacking our democratic process</a>, threatening to keep people of color and those economically challenged from being able to cast their votes in November. I will do everything in my power to ensure every eligible voter\u2019s voice will be counted.</p> <p>\u201cAs for those out there who use our national crisis as an excuse to marginalize others or do harm to others because of their race, religion, sexual orientation or gender identity, not only do I not support you, I will do everything in my power to see you are prosecuted. Because the whole point of the president\u2019s power is to use it to protect those who need it most. And if that offends you, then don\u2019t vote for me.</p> <p>\u201cAs of right now, my administration is fully committed to one mission: keeping our people physically healthy while also protecting the country\u2019s economic health. Balancing those two crucial, yet sometimes competing goals is the greatest challenge this country has faced in decades. No one has definitive answers because this situation is unique. However, it is our pledge to never put lives at risk just for the sake of unnecessary economic policies. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/11/texas-reopen-economy-coronavirus-covid-19\">Any decision regarding opening businesses</a> or reducing shelter-in-place will be data-driven, based only on the information gathered by the country\u2019s leading scientific and medical experts, not partisan appointments.</p> <p>\u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/01/could-covid-19-be-manmade-what-we-know-about-origins-trump-chinese-lab-coronavirus\">No one knows definitively how the virus originated</a>. But investigating the source is crucial to further understanding how it works and spreads and may help us to battle other viruses in the future. Countries need to work together to gather this information, not to place blame or levy accusations or seek reparations, but rather to help humanity survive. Toward that end, I pledge no actions will be sought against any country involved.</p> <p>\u201cTo ensure that my focus remains on this task, I will not participate in any campaigning for the 2020 presidency. I will continue to run for the office, but I will let my actions alone be my campaign. How I conduct myself as your leader over these next few months is my campaign.</p> <p>\u201cI will make no campaign speeches, I will not <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/donald-trump-s-attacks-joe-biden-risk-blowing-back-him-n1203316\">talk disparagingly of my opponent</a> or his surrogates. There will be no activity regarding the border wall or other divisive issues. We all need to work together to overcome this threat in the here and now, without one eye perpetually on November. <a href=\"https://www.history.com/news/abraham-lincoln-house-divided-speech\">President Lincoln said</a>, \u201cA house divided against itself cannot stand.\u201d That is even more appropriate now, 162 years later, as we face an increasing death toll and a declining economy. America is fighting for its survival \u2013 not just as a country, but as an ideal. And nothing is more important than proving to ourselves and the rest of the world that our shared ideals are powerful enough to overcome any enemy, seen or unseen.\u201d</p> <p>That is the speech of a president determined to lead us during our darkest days and uncertain future. It requires abandoning all notions of ratings and personal aggrandizement to just focus on the welfare of the people in their moment of deepest need. It requires someone who loves the country more than their career. It requires greatness.</p> <p><br></p>",
  "<p>One day a month into quarantine, Christie was leading a Zoom board meeting of the local political club where she\u2019s president when the floor in the unit directly above started creaking. It was just as she feared: her upstairs neighbor had decided to engage in loud intimate activities.</p> <p>\u201cI just sat there waiting to see if anyone said anything,\u201d she said from her San Diego apartment. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t hear it. But it was so distracting and made me so anxious.\u201d</p> <p>Now she\u2019s looking fearfully ahead to the next Zoom meeting she\u2019s slated to lead with the full club, which will feature 30 to 60 people, including elected officials. \u201cThe thought of that happening again during it scares me a lot,\u201d she said. \u201cI need to ask how thick the walls are next time I move.\u201d</p> <p>Americans are spending more time than ever at home and that means redefining relationships with neighbors \u2013 for better and, sometimes, for worse.</p> <p>In cities, parties in apartment buildings that were once merely a nuisance may seem suddenly nefarious, imbued with the potential to unleash contagion.<strong> </strong>And disturbances like a baby crying or a particularly thunderous living-room dance-off can quickly drive the best-intentioned neighbors to despair.</p> <p>One 47-year-old mom of two in Minneapolis said a neighbor\u2019s birthday party recently prompted her to call the police. \u201cSeeing them all gathering, not caring about social distancing, I actually started to cry,\u201d she said. \u201cEach one person that doesn\u2019t care causes a ripple effect.

That is, until she realized there was still a way to connect.</p> <p>\u201cWe set up a long table at the end of our driveway with the four ice chests of crawfish,\u201d she said, and each family had just one designated person approach. \u201cEveryone took their crawfish to their front porches and we laughed and yelled around to each other. We also saw some neighbors that we don\u2019t see as often. The crawfish really brought everyone out.\u201d</p> <p>Such interactions mark a surprising shift. A pre-Covid<a href=\"http://cityobservatory.org/less-in-common/\"> report</a> found that only about a fifth of Americans regularly spent time with their neighbors, while a third said they had never interacted with those living next door to them.

  "<h2><strong>What started \u2018Obamagate\u2019?</strong></h2> \n<p>On Friday, former US president Barack Obama expressed disquiet at the justice department dropping charges against Donald Trump\u2019s former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who was fired in early 2017 for lying about conversations with the Russian ambassador. On a recording obtained by Yahoo News, Obama warned that the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/09/obama-leaked-conversation-us-rule-of-law-at-risk-flynn-case-dropped\"> \u201crule of law is at risk\u201d</a>. He also described Trump\u2019s handling of the coronavirus pandemic as \u201can absolute chaotic disaster\u201d.</p> \n<h2><strong>So Trump took the moral high ground and kept a dignified silence?</strong></h2> \n<p>Not quite. He spent Mother\u2019s Day diving into the rightwing fever swamps and unleashing a barrage of tweets and retweets assailing his predecessor. One said simply \u201cOBAMAGATE!\u201d (the suffix \u201cgate\u201d is a frequently used play on the Watergate scandal that toppled President Richard Nixon).</p> \n<p>Another linked to a post that declared, \u201cBarack Hussain Obama is the first Ex-President to ever speak against his successor, which was long tradition of decorum and decency.\u201d Trump added: \u201cHe got caught, OBAMAGATE!\u201d</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/10/trump-obama-biggest-political-american-history-russia-michael-flynn\">Trump claims Obama committed 'biggest political crime in American history'</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2><strong>Got caught doing what, exactly?</strong></h2> \n<p>Trump also retweeted Buck Sexton, a rightwing podcaster who asserted that \u201cthe outgoing president used his last weeks in office to target incoming officials and sabotage the new administration\u201d. The president then added his own commentary: \u201cThe biggest political crime in American history, by far!\u201d</p> \n<p>In other remarks on Thursday last week, Trump claimed without evidence that Flynn had been targeted by the Obama administration in an attempt to take down Trump himself. He bandied around terms such as \u201ctreason\u201d and \u201chuman scum\u201d.</p> \n<p>Flynn, a retired general, pleaded guilty to making false statements in a charge brought by then-Special Counsel Robert Mueller. He now insists he did not lie and wants to back out of the plea.</p> \n<p>Trump and his supporters have seized on recently disclosed FBI documents from interviews with Flynn, claiming they show he was the victim of \u201cdirty cops\u201d. One handwritten note from the FBI\u2019s then-director of counterintelligence said: \u201cWhat\u2019s our goal? Truth/Admission or to get him to lie, so we can prosecute him or get him fired?\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>Can this really be pinned on Obama?</strong></h2> \n<p>A fact check by the Associated Press concluded: \u201cIt is true that the investigation into ties between Russia and the Trump campaign, and into Russia in particular, began during the Obama administration. But it continued well into Trump\u2019s own administration. The investigation into Flynn was taken over by a special counsel who was appointed by Rod Rosenstein, Trump\u2019s own deputy attorney general.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe internal FBI correspondence that has emerged in the last two weeks also doesn\u2019t reveal agents saying that the goal of the investigation was to take down a president.\u201d</p> \n<h2><strong>So what exact crime is Trump accusing Obama of committing?</strong></h2> \n<p>The president himself does not seem to know. \u201c\u2018Obamagate\u2019,\u201d he ruminated in the White House rose garden on Monday. \u201cIt\u2019s been going on for a long time. It\u2019s been going on from before I even got elected. And it\u2019s a disgrace that it happened.\u201d</p> \n<p>Asked by a Washington Post reporter for the second time to name Obama\u2019s exact offence, Trump replied cryptically: \u201cYou know what the crime is. The crime is very obvious to everybody. All you have to do is read the newspapers, except yours.\u201d</p> \n<p>Clear as mud, then.</p> \n<h2>Could this be a distraction from something?</h2> \n<p><br>Some critics believe Trump is desperately trying to deflect attention from his confused and faltering response to the pandemic, as the US death toll tops 80,000 and the economy suffers the worst job losses since the Great Depression. They could also be a way of undermining Obama\u2019s vice president, Joe Biden, whom Trump will face in November\u2019s presidential election.</p> \n<p>And they are indicative of a longstanding obsession. Trump effectively began his political career by pushing the \u201cbirther\u201d conspiracy theory that Obama was not born in the US and therefore should not be eligible for the presidency.

Those are great developments.</strong> But unfortunately they do not mean that America\u2019s testing regime is on par with other countries. </p> \n  <p>For one thing, the United States is a huge country, with a population about seven times that of South Korea. Many more tests need to be conducted here. It\u2019s also telling that the White House says that less than 10% of tests are positive. Does that mean that a smaller proportion of Americans are positive \u2013 or that the US is testing the wrong people? </p> \n  <p>Unlike South Korea, Vietnam, China and other countries that have had success at containing the virus, the United States has not, in most places, stood up consistent contact tracing for positive cases \u2013 meaning that the country has a blind spot to outbreaks, and that the selection of patients tested is relatively random. </p> \n  <p>As for the death rate in the United States versus Germany and other places \u2013 unfortunately, unlike Germany and other places, the number of confirmed deaths in the United States, a number the US appears to track less carefully than Germany, is still climbing.</p> \n  <p><strong>If you go hunting you don\u2019t brag about how many times you shot \u2013 you brag about how many ducks you bagged. Trump is bragging about shots fired. </strong>And his numbers of tests do not seem to represent numbers of people tested \u2013 repeat tests for certain people, such as health care workers and other people on the front lines (and people in positions of power in Washington) make the per capita number in the United States larger than it is in fact. In fact, most people do not have access to testing through the workplace, and quality daily testing is not in reach for most of America. </p> \n  <p>Finally, unlike other countries, the United States has not paired its testing program with a supported isolation program. That means that outbreaks can accelerate undetected, as health officials mostly are not searching the network of contacts of positive cases, and people in contact with positive cases, who could be asymptomatic carriers, <br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-11T21:01:46.580Z\">at 10.01pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5eb9bb638f080c72745390cd\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-11T20:57:09.092Z\">9.57pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>For a second time, Trump was asked why the White House staff is able to be tested daily when that is still not available for the American people.

When you ask China that question you may get a very unusual answer.\u201d</p> \n<p>The president then called on another reporter, Kaitlan Collins of CNN, but she paused as Jiang interjected: \u201cSir, why are you saying that to me, specifically?\u201d</p> \n<p>The president replied: \u201cI am not saying it specifically to anybody. I am saying it to anybody who would ask a nasty question like that.\u201d</p> \n<p>The CBS correspondent pointed out: \u201cThat is not a nasty question.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4f5a2873a10721efc7db4d164376b434729ef95d\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4f5a2873a10721efc7db4d164376b434729ef95d/0_0_3500_2479/1000.jpg\" alt=\"CNN correspondent Kaitlan Collins, center, tries to ask a question on the heels of Donald Trump\u2019s exchange with CBS News correspondent Weija Jiang, left.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"708\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">CNN correspondent Kaitlan Collins, center, tries to ask a question on the heels of Donald Trump\u2019s exchange with CBS News correspondent Weija Jiang, left.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Collins, at the microphone, then tried to ask her question, but Trump said he was now looking to someone at the back. As Collins repeatedly objected, the president turned on his heel and left the podium.</p> \n<p>Trump has frequently been criticised for adopting a particularly harsh or patronising tone at press conferences to women in general and women of colour in particular. Jiang was born in China but immigrated to America at the age of two.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/TaraSetmayer\">Tara Setmayer</a>, a political commentator, tweeted: \u201cAnother disgraceful, racist, temper tantrum by Trump b/c he was asked a pointed question by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/weijia\">@weijia</a>\u2026 Trump can\u2019t handle smart, assertive women.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Democratic congressman Ted Lieu of California tweeted: \u201cDear @realDonaldTrump: Asian Americans are Americans. Some of us served on active duty in the U.S. military. Some are on the frontlines fighting this pandemic as paramedics and health care workers. Some are reporters like @weijia. Stop dividing our nation.\u201d</p> \n<p>Earlier at the briefing, Trump claimed that the US\u2019s testing capacity was \u201cunmatched and unrivalled anywhere in the world, and it\u2019s not even close\u201d. More than 9m tests have now been performed, he said, and where three weeks ago roughly 150,000 per day were done, the total is now 300,000 per day and will go up.</p> \n<p>Trump said this week the US will pass 10m tests, nearly double the number of any country and more per capita than South Korea, the UK, France, Japan, Sweden, Finland and many others. But critics point out that South Korea implemented its testing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/28/trump-coronavirus-politics-us-health-disaster\">much quicker</a>, flattening the curve of cases so fewer tests were required.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/28/trump-coronavirus-politics-us-health-disaster\">The missing six weeks: how Trump failed the biggest test of his life</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The president announced his administration was sending $11bn to states, territories and tribes to boost testing. He described it as an effort to \u201cback up\u201d states but did not unveil the national testing strategy that many experts have called for.</p> \n<p>Trump also claimed without basis that \u201cif somebody wants to be tested right now, they\u2019ll be able to be tested\u201d, echoing a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/mar/06/joe-biden-bernie-sanders-2020-presidential-election-trump-coronavirus-live-updates?page=with:block-5e62d0228f08c2df6d274db5#block-5e62d0228f08c2df6d274db5\">spurious claim</a> he made way back on 6 March.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn every generation, through every challenge and hardship and danger, America has risen to the task,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have met the moment and we have prevailed.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump, who has been encouraging states to reopen, promised: \u201cWe will defeat this horrible enemy, we will revive our economy and we will transition into greatness. That\u2019s a phrase you\u2019re gonna hear a lot.\u201d</p> \n<p>Democrats expressed scepticism. Daniel Wessel, Democratic National Committee deputy war room director, said: \u201cTrump says we \u2018prevailed\u2019 on testing, but his response has been a complete failure and made this crisis worse than it needed to be.</p> \n<p>\u201cTrump still hasn\u2019t helped states reach the testing capacity they need, every American who wants a test can\u2019t get a test, and he is only now taking steps that should\u2019ve happened weeks ago. While Trump wants to declare mission accomplished, the American people are still suffering and will not forget how he gave up on them.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"b1b6094b-4353-4b1f-98f8-896590e3f2c2\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gDPa1I4HVAY?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The campaign group Protect Our Care noted that it was 13 days since Trump said the US will run 5m daily tests \u201cvery soon\u201d. Zac Petkanas, director of its coronavirus war room, recalled that Trump promised that anyone who wants a test could get a test and that the US would soon be testing 5 million Americans per day.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis wasn\u2019t true when he said it and it\u2019s not true today. What is true is that more than 80,000 Americans have lost their lives in large part because Donald Trump still hasn\u2019t taken testing seriously. The only thing that the president has prevailed at is making America first in reported deaths and infections.\u201d</p> \n<p>The White House itself is not immune from coronavirus. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/08/coronavirus-outbreak-us-trump-pence-press-secretary\">Katie Miller</a>, the press secretary for Vice-President Mike Pence, and a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/07/trump-valet-coronavirus-positive-us\">personal valet</a> who works for Trump both tested positive last week. Those entering the West Wing are now required to wear a mask or face covering, after a new memo was issued on Monday. Trump and Pence are being tested every day. Trump, however, is exempt from wearing a mask in the White House. It\u2019s not clear if Pence will wear one or not.</p> \n<p>The president said it was \u201cshocking\u201d how many people come in and out of the White House every day. \u201cI\u2019ve felt no vulnerability whatsoever,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>During the press conference, Trump\u2019s presidential election opponent, Joe Biden, tweeted: \u201cDonald Trump and his team seem to understand how critical testing is to their own safety. So why are they insisting that it\u2019s unnecessary for the American people?\u201d</p>"
