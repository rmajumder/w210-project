  "<p>On the day of Donald Trump\u2019s election, economists predicted calamity.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/26/us-unemployment-rate-coronavirus-business\">Record 3.3m Americans file for unemployment as the US tries to contain Covid-19</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe are very probably looking at a global recession, with no end in sight,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/projects/cp/opinion/election-night-2016/paul-krugman-the-economic-fallout\">wrote Paul Krugman,</a> a columnist at the New York Times.</p> <p>The US president and his allies have spent the past three years crowing, mocking Krugman as a prophet of doom. What no one could have predicted is that when the doomsday prophecy came true, it would be the result of a lightning bolt not of Trump\u2019s own making.</p> <p>The scale of the economic devastation wrought by the coronavirus pandemic became clear on Thursday when it emerged that 3.3 million people filed for unemployment insurance last week. It was almost five times the previous record, set in 1982, and by some estimates the jobless figure could reach 12m to 15m before the storm has passed.</p> <p>Suddenly the political landscape has changed. A presidential election and races in the Senate and House are set to take place with an economy undergoing both the biggest contraction and the worst surge in unemployment ever seen. In Washington, a city of heroic statues and soaring monuments, the most relevant now is <a href=\"https://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2011633289/\">the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial</a>, with its bronze figures huddled in a Great Depression breadline.</p> <p>In the race for the White House, there are some key questions. Will Trump be blamed, justifiably or otherwise, for millions losing their jobs? Or will voters embrace his claim to be a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/22/trump-coronavirus-election-november-2020\">\u201cwartime president\u201d</a> and conclude this is no time to change? Can his likely opponent, Joe Biden, capitalise on his own strengths as a voice of competence and experience, to present himself as the moral leader the nation needs?</p> <p>For Trump, this is personal. As a billionaire businessman, he predicated his entire political identity on his ability to steward the economy by slashing regulations, shredding trade deals and reviving manufacturing towns.</p> <p>For three years he bragged \u201cJOBS JOBS JOBS!\u201d and never missed a chance to tout unemployment figures for the population at large \u2013 just last month, the rate was at a 50-year low of 3.5% \u2013 and African Americans and Latinos in particular. The true picture was more complicated and unevenly distributed, but the central message was: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/nov/16/harold-macmillan-never-had-it-so-good\">you\u2019ve never had it so good.</a></p> <p>Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/opinion/coronavirus-trump-economy.html\">other vital sign of virility,</a> the stock market, has been smashed too, nearly all the gains of his presidency wiped out. It was this more than anything, perhaps, that belatedly persuaded him the virus could not simply be wished away.</p> <p>It is therefore no surprise the president is itching to get the economy fired up again. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/trumps-push-to-shorten-the-coronavirus-shutdown-proves-the-captain-is-flying-blind\">His push for an Easter Sunday</a> deadline may be ethically callous and scientifically ignorant but politically shrewd.

The message, doubtless amplified by Fox News, will be: \u201cLook, I tried, but my hands were tied.\u201d</p> <p>Trump is about to sign Congress\u2019s $2.2tn aid package designed to prevent complete economic collapse. His treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, did most of the hard work but the president gets to claim the credit. For Democrats, like all opposition parties in wartime, there is a difficult balance in holding Trump accountable while not appearing to undermine national unity. They also have to work with Republicans to keep the money flowing until there is light at end of the tunnel.</p> <p>Henry Olsen, a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center thinktank, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/03/25/were-not-killing-economy-over-coronavirus-were-putting-it-into-coma/\">wrote in the Washington Post</a>: \u201cWe should know by June if this approach works.</p> <p>\u201cIf it does, the number of Covid-19 infections will have plummeted, deaths from the virus will have flatlined, and people will be coming back to work in droves. It could be the biggest V-shaped economic recovery in US history \u2013 the political-economy version of the resuscitation of a patient after an induced coma.\u201d</p> <p>Olsen added: \u201cIt\u2019s too early to predict what the political fallout from a successful pirouette would be, but it\u2019s hard to see how it doesn\u2019t at least insulate President Trump from much criticism about the virus\u2019s arrival to begin with. Democrats can say he should have done more, but the fact remains that no other western leader did better to anticipate the onset of the coronavirus.</p> <p>\u201cTrump\u2019s critics are not going to change their stripes, but the few people who remain open to persuasion are as likely to credit Trump as to blame him.\u201d</p> <p>This is the best-case scenario for the president: presenting himself, however spuriously, as the man who led America through its greatest crisis since the second world war, early missteps long forgotten. Biden, meanwhile, is struggling to break through the cacophony and to master the internet, his thunder stolen by New York\u2019s Democratic governor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/cuomo-wins-praise-for-wisdom-amid-coronavirus-crisis-as-trump-blusters\">Andrew Cuomo.</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/experts/william-a-galston/\">Bill Galston,</a> a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution thinktank in Washington and former policy adviser to Bill Clinton, said: \u201cMost people believe this kind of crisis plays to Biden\u2019s strengths. Against that, with the people involved in his campaign, he\u2019s not been very effective at showing that strength.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/us-coronavirus-stimulus-all-you-need-to-know\">US coronavirus stimulus checks: are you eligible and how much will you get?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThey\u2019re not very innovative. They don\u2019t seem to have a strategy to keep him in the conversation. They seem a little flummoxed by the technology of the situation.\u201d</p> <p>The worst-case scenario for Trump looks very different. If the death toll keeps climbing, big and small businesses are ruined and the economy sinks into 1930s-style wreckage, his early denialism will be played endlessly in election attack ads. His mendacious press briefings will be taken as proof that he could not rise to the challenge and Democrats will be more energised than ever to dispatch him.</p> <p>So far, polls suggest Trump is getting a bump like George W Bush after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks. A Gallup survey published on Tuesday showed 60% of Americans gave him positive reviews for his handling of the coronavirus outbreak, and his overall approval rating matched the highest point in his presidency, at 49%, included rises among independents and even Democrats.</p> <p>But this was taken before he reversed his reversal and went back to downplaying the virus, and before the unemployment figures delivered an almighty gut punch.</p> <p>There is a long way to go. It is hard to believe that Trump\u2019s impeachment trial ended only last month. In those terms, the November election is still a lifetime away.</p>",
  "<p>Israel\u2019s main opposition party has split after its leader, Benny Gantz, was elected as speaker of parliament with the support of his rivals, including Benjamin Netanyahu, in a stunning plot twist to a year-long political crisis.</p> <p>Gantz\u2019s move was widely interpreted as a precursor to a power-sharing deal with the prime minister to form an emergency government. The coronavirus pandemic, including more than 2,600 confirmed Israeli cases, has added urgency to efforts to break a stalemate between the two leaders.</p> <p>\u201cThese are unusual times and they call for unusual decisions. That\u2019s why I intend to explore the formation of a national emergency government,\u201d Gantz told the Knesset, Israel\u2019s parliament.</p> <p>While neither side confirmed that an agreement was already in place, suggested scenarios have included Gantz and Netanyahu taking turns as prime minister in a rotation system.</p> <p>Whatever the outcome, Gantz took a risk by nominating himself for speaker, and he was accused of blindsiding allies and supporters in the process.</p> <p>Throughout three elections, the former head of the army has run campaigns squarely focused on promises to oust Netanyahu, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/21/israeli-prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahu-indicted-for-bribery-and\">faces criminal charges</a> for alleged corruption.</p> <p>Before the vote, Gantz\u2019s public plans were to elect a speaker from his party and push through legislation to end Netanyahu\u2019s historic political career through term limits and bans on prime ministers serving while under indictment.</p> <p>That plan appears to have been abandoned by the opposition leader in favour of the complete opposite \u2013 he may now, as speaker, protect Netanyahu from such legislation to keep the possibility of a unity government alive.</p> <p>However, in doing so, Gantz\u2019s Blue and White party looks on the brink of disintegration, with factions within it refusing to back his candidacy for speaker, and several moving to break away.</p> <p>Both the Yesh Atid and Telem parties, which hold more than half of Blue and White\u2019s seats, filed to leave the alliance.</p> <p>Yair Lapid, Gantz\u2019s running mate and the head of Yesh Atid, accused the leader of surrendering \u201cwithout a fight\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cBenny Gantz decided today to break apart Blue and White and crawl into Netanyahu\u2019s government,\u201d he said at a press conference on Thursday evening. \u201cWe ran together because Benny Gantz looked me in the eye and said we would never sit in this bad government.\u201d</p> <p>Tamar Zandberg, a member of the leftwing Meretz party allied with Blue and White, accused Gantz of abandoning millions of voters who sought an alternative to Netanyahu.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019ll end up a rug under the feet of an alleged crook, an inciter and racist,\u201d she said in a speech to the session. \u201cWe are overwhelmed by the depth of the deceit and disgrace that has plagued today.\u201d</p> <p>In his speech, Gantz said he would \u201cnever compromise on the principles underpinning the votes of over a million Israelis who voted for Blue and White. I will never compromise on democracy. Netanyahu is well aware of that.\u201d</p> <p>While a unity government was not confirmed, a member of Netanyahu\u2019s rightwing bloc, the defence minister Naftali Bennett, publicly congratulated Gantz for what he said was \u201cthe brave step of entering into a unity government under Netanyahu\u201d.</p> <p>Israel\u2019s previous speaker, Yuli Edelstein, was a close ally of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/benjamin-netanyahu\">Netanyahu</a> and a member of Likud. He <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/netanyahu-ally-yuli-edelstein-resigns-speaker-israel-parliament\">resigned on Wednesday</a> following fierce criticism of his refusal to open parliament, which he suspended last week citing a ban of large gatherings while the country tackled the coronavirus.</p> <p>The suspension was decried as an anti-democratic attempt to shield his job and to protect Netanyahu from bills that could oust him.</p> <p>For the past year Israel has been in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/01/israel-limbo-third-election-twelve-months-netanyahu-gantz\">state of political paralysis</a> as a result of three inconclusive elections, the latest of which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/03/israel-election-benjamin-netanyahu-claims-early-victory-but-remains-short-of-majority\">was held on 2 March</a>. In that time both Netanyahu and Gantz have been picked to form governments and failed. Throughout the crisis, Netanyahu has remained interim prime minister.</p> <p>Gantz was the latest to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/israels-opposition-head-benny-gantz-wins-support-to-form-government\">tasked with forming a government</a> after gathering a loose coalition of anti-Netanyahu Knesset members to back his candidacy.

Their perverse version of rightwing anti-authoritarianism implies that there is nothing wrong with the wealthy; in fact, the latter can be superior sources of wisdom. Trump putting the advice of \u201cbusiness leaders\u201d above that of infectious disease experts is likely to yield deadly results. But it\u2019s important to understand that the systematic denigration of professionalism started not with the populists \u2013 Reagan, Thatcher and other cheerleaders for neoliberalism led the way.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/26/under-coronavirus-pro-market-ideologies-are-overturned-around-the-world-but-its-too-little-too-late\">Under coronavirus,  ideologies are overturned around the world. But it is too little, too late | Jeff Sparrow</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Populists are often criticized for being great simplifiers, when the world is in fact highly complex. For those who take Trump to be the paradigmatic populist of our day, it\u2019s easy to conclude that populists are constantly lying and ushering in a \u201cpost-truth\u201d era, in which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/coronavirus-cure-kills-man-after-trump-touts-chloroquine-phosphate\">falsehoods exclusively produced by the daily White House reality TV show are literally turning out to be deadly.</a></p> <p>But this picture is itself simplistic. Populists are not by definition liars. They are only committed to one particular empirical falsehood: the notion that they, and only they, represent what populists often call \u201cthe real people\u201d \u2013 with the implication that other politicians are not only corrupt and \u201ccrooked\u201d, but traitors to the people, or, as Trump has often put it, \u201cUn-American\u201d.</p> <p>More important, it\u2019s not true that today\u2019s rightwing populists are indiscriminately against <em>all </em>elites. They only denounce professionals. Trump supporters did not find it scandalous that his cabinet was full of Wall Street figures. <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/11/what-so-many-people-dont-get-about-the-u-s-working-class\">The base does not resent the rich</a> \u2013 rather, it aspires to be rich. In their eyes, the wealthy have earned their money, an objective indicator of their \u201chard work\u201d, or the fact that they really produced something (never mind that the likes of Ross and Mnuchin have never created anything and only shifted money around).</p> <p>These supposed movers and shakers contrast starkly with professionals who claim authority on the basis of education and special licensing \u2013 think lawyers, doctors and professors. Such figures can automatically be maligned by rightwing culture warriors as \u201ccondescending\u201d \u2013 after all, they tell other people what to do, because they claim to know better. According to Nigel Farage, for instance, the World Health Organization is just another club of \u201cclever people\u201d who want to \u201cbully us\u201d.</p> <p>Is the success of the Trumps, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/brazils-jair-bolsonaro-says-coronavirus-crisis-is-a-media-trick\">Bolsonaros</a> and Johnsons of this world proof that the people can always be seduced by demagogues \u2013 and simply don\u2019t know what\u2019s good for them? Distrust of professionalism does not come out of nowhere. Neoliberalism paved the way for these attitudes. Margaret Thatcher memorably held that academics didn\u2019t really do any work; in fact, they all \u2013 with the possible exception of scientists \u2013 seemed to be lefties wasting taxpayers\u2019 money. Tories introduced the imperative constantly to audit and assess (and discipline and punish those not measuring up); only what could be counted, counted. Governments that praised \u201cfree markets\u201d \u2013 the spontaneous emergence of economic order \u2013 actually ended up constructing entirely artificial \u201cmarkets\u201d in academia and healthcare. These pseudo-markets had to provide the right \u201cincentives\u201d \u2013 because, so the assumption went, professionals could not possibly be motivated by intrinsic goals of helping patients or pursuing research or educating young people.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This concerted attack on professionalism made it easier for Trump and Boris Johnson to claim that they might just know better than leading scientists</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The result was not a genuine market, but a vast bureaucracy reminiscent of the late Soviet Union. What one historian has called <a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691174952/the-tyranny-of-metrics\">\u201cthe tyranny of metrics\u201d</a> meant that the measure became the target; the relentless quantification of performance distorted what and how professionals performed. Enormous resources, and a fair bit of cunning, went into gaming a system which was based on the suspicion that professional self-regulation and internal accountability are sham ideals that just justify professionals erecting monopolies and closed shops.</p> <p>This concerted attack on professionalism made it easier for Trump and Boris Johnson to claim that they might just know better than leading scientists. Business leaders are praised as more capable decision-makers, when it comes to the length of a lockdown, than epidemiologists. Trump \u2013 who apparently listens to <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2020/03/as-the-crisis-escalates-trump-experiments-with-a-pivot?utm_medium=social&amp;utm\">theories cooked up by his uniquely unqualified son-in-law</a> and fears being upstaged by Anthony Fauci \u2013 has still not understood that the longer amateur hour at the very top lasts, the more lives will be lost.</p> <p>The Covid-19 crisis might lead us to a clear-eyed view of the value of professionalism (including professionals in politics like, say, Hillary Clinton). But it\u2019s also important to keep professionalism in its place. Professional advice should constrain political choices, not determine them. Proper professionals, unlike technocrats, do not promise that they know the uniquely correct solution to all policy problems.</p> <p>The assumption that there is only one right way is perversely shared by populists and technocrats: populists claim that there is only one authentic popular will (to build a Wall, get Brexit done, or what have you), and that they are the only ones who know it \u2013 and the only ones who can implement it. The technocratic stance \u2013 widely on display on the continent during the European debt crisis \u2013 holds that there is only one rational answer to policy challenges, and that only technocrats can identify it. If you disagree with a populist, you are declared a traitor to the people; if you disagree with a technocrat, you\u2019ll be told politely that you\u2019re not smart enough.</p> <p>The lesson is not that professionalism should replace democratic politics, or, for that matter, widespread participation by citizens \u2013 a conclusion drawn by unashamedly elitist liberals who have sought to reinstate professional gatekeepers everywhere, but <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/more-professionalism-less-populism.pdf\">especially in primaries</a>. Citizens still know best what their problems are; professionals \u2013 in perfectly non-condescending ways \u2013 play a crucial role in addressing them. Or, as John Dewey, the greatest American philosopher of democracy in the 20th century, put it, \u201cno government by experts in which the masses do not have the chance to inform the experts as to their needs can be anything but an oligarchy managed in the interests of the few.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p>Jan-Werner M\u00fcller teaches at Princeton.

Designed to appeal to people working from home as well as stay-at-home parents, sick kids and hungover students, its scattergun approach can make it one of the most strangely enlivening yet comforting sections of the TV schedule \u2013 the perfect background scene to your day\u2019s activities.</p> <p>For 18 months, when I was working from home as a freelance, I would eat my breakfast in front of the TV, usually opting for a dose of Homes Under the Hammer or Frasier, then get dressed and get to work. Alternatively, I would stay where I was, melting into the sofa, unable to find the remote as the entirety of This Morning (all 150 minutes of it) gave way to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/sep/01/letting-it-all-out-behind-of-the-scenes-of-loose-women\">Loose Women</a> and \u2013 on particularly unfruitful days \u2013 Jeremy Kyle. Those days stretched the definition of \u201cwork\u201d.</p> <p>Yet there was one daytime staple that would forever lurk in the periphery, a bizarrely reassuring presence that celebrates its 20th anniversary this week: Doctors. Set in the fictional West Midlands town of Letherbridge, its daily 28-minute episodes unpick the middling dramas of a local GP surgery and its surprisingly wacky cast of characters.</p> <p>While Doctors may sound like a sanitised Holby City or House, it operates in a far more obscure and \u2013 dare I say it \u2013 avant-garde space. On the surface, each episode contains one medical predicament that is usually neatly resolved, while affairs and longstanding resentments bubble throughout the weeks. The seasoning, though, is sprinkled liberally in the form of a two-pronged attack: truly absurd plot scenarios and acting that is so wooden it almost seems as if the whole show is a running joke at the viewers\u2019 expense.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa360a642c0479ed25a8a63361d38850f64618b8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa360a642c0479ed25a8a63361d38850f64618b8/346_37_1464_879/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Pasquale in Doctors\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Double Joe party ...

That\u2019s right, early 00s variety show comedian Joe Pasquale \u2013 who gamely appeared in the episode, as if to prove his enduring existence. You would think such a severe break from mental acuity would prompt some sort of panic. But no, this is Doctors, so Pasquale is used as a running gag and Lizzie is ultimately carted off for \u201cneurological testing\u201d. We never see her again. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/jun/30/david-lynch-interview-manchester-international-festival\">David Lynch</a> would never be so brave as to attempt a Pasquale in one of his dream sequences.</p> <p>In another episode, a man entered the surgery to have a vasectomy, only to find out \u2013 on the suspiciously unsterilised surgical table \u2013 that his partner had been cheating on him all along, that the child he thought was his was the product of a Mallorcan one-night stand and that he should retain his vas deferens after all. He found this out because his partner was watching him have the surgery (in the same room!) and stepped in at the last minute to deliver another Doctors mannequin monologue.</p> <p>It may seem surprising that the drama has clung on for so long \u2013 having borne no notable acting talent \u2013 but its fans are a committed bunch, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCDoctors/photos/a.377035905709708.93903.359687864111179/1709991015747517/?type=3&amp;theater\">taking to social media</a> to vent their outrage when it has been placed on summer hiatus in favour of the football and ensuring its steady survival in the ratings.

It is a familiar hum of conversation to tune out while you work, just as you would at the office, or a woozy fever dream to accompany your own lethargy.</p> <p>Now that most of the UK population will have the chance to watch the show in real time, tuning in at 1.45pm in a post-lunch haze after their 15th consecutive meal of pasta and toilet paper to absorb whichever new medical drama and C-list celebrity cameo comes to light.

  "<p><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2223783/\">Haifaa Al-Mansour</a>\u2019s latest film, <a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6971114/\">The Perfect Candidate</a>, opens with a doctor in her 20s driving to work. In any other film you wouldn\u2019t register the fact that she\u2019s behind the wheel. But this woman, dressed in a black abaya and niqab, is in Saudi Arabia, which until 2018 banned women from driving. Al-Mansour added the scene as a punch-the-air moment for female audiences in Saudi Arabia, an invite to a collective whoop of victory. \u201cI know that in the west this seems like common-sense stuff,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I think they\u2019ve really helped women to see themselves as an independent people.\u201d She fixes me with an earnest look, to see if I get it. \u201cFor younger professional women, it\u2019s huge, because it gives them control over their destiny.\u201d</p> <p>Al-Mansour is Saudi Arabia\u2019s first female director. In 2011, she shot her debut, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jul/18/wadjda-review\">Wadjda</a>, hiding in the back of a van. It would have been impossible for a woman to be seen openly on the street giving orders to men. So, she kept out of sight and used a walkie-talkie (\u201cBut I\u2019m sure you could hear my voice all over Riyadh. \u2018Do that!\u2019 \u2018Pull the camera back!\u2019\u201d) The film was gorgeous, a funny, big-hearted story about a gobby 10-year-old girl who would stop at nothing to get her hands on a bike. Al-Mansour shrugged off the death threats (\u201cOne of them told me they had a coffin ready for me\u201d). Spend five minutes in her company and you are struck by her optimistic energy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/aug/30/the-perfect-candidate-review-venice-film-festival\">The Perfect Candidate review \u2013 powerful insight into Saudi absurdity</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The new film is another inspiring story of female resistance, this time about a young female doctor who runs, almost by accident, for office in local elections. This time around, following the easing of restrictions segregating men and women, Al-Mansour could work in public. \u201cI wasn\u2019t in the van this time,\u201d she grins. \u201cI was shouting at all my crew in person!\u201d</p> <p>We meet in London on International Women\u2019s Day, when social distancing is still a novelty. Walking into the cafe, 5ft-nothing in her Converse, she shakes my hand and then, mindful of the breach of etiquette, reaches into her handbag for a bottle of hand sanitiser and squirts me a dollop. The exchange smacks of her mix of warmth and no-nonsense.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_b8HQTAqbmg\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_b8HQTAqbmg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p> Four years ago, Al-Mansour moved from Bahrain to Los Angeles with her American husband Bradley Neimann, a diplomat, and their son, Adam, 12, and daughter, Hailey, 10. (\u201cThey are very American,\u201d she says of her kids. \u201cThey say \u2018dude\u2019 with an American accent.\u201d) But she missed home and so she wrote The Perfect Candidate, which stars the impossibly beautiful TV actor Mila Al Zahrani as Dr Maryam, a supremely capable young medic working in a rundown hospital (healthcare is a major employer of women). The film catches society in the midst of a transformation, at a moment when women have more freedom, but society is slow to embrace them. When Maryam holds an all-female fundraiser, the response is depressing: \u201cMy husband will kill me if I vote for you.\u201d \u201cI hope you win, but I don\u2019t vote.\u201d I\u2019m not giving anything away to say that Maryam has a tough time of it on the campaign trail \u2013 laughed at, patronised by a TV presenter, criticised as shrill and unfeminine.</p> <p>Was Al-Mansour making a more universal point? \u201cYeah, they are crushed. Look at Hillary Clinton. But seeing women in leadership positions is something people need to get used to.\u201d</p> <p>At the start of the film Maryam wears the niqab; as she grows more confident in her identity it comes off. What did Al-Mansour want to say about the veil? \u201cAt the beginning Maryam wants to fit in. And what does society expect of women? To cover up. But at the end she understands what defiance means. It\u2019s about respect. A human being\u2019s identity is in their face. I think face covering is one of the most dangerous things that ever happened to the Muslim culture.\u201d For the first time in our conversation Al-Mansour is deadly serious. \u201cWe need female Muslim scholars who can deconstruct a lot of the literature about a woman\u2019s body and the veil. Like, for example, when I was a kid I was, I was told: \u2018You are like a cake. If you don\u2019t cover it, flies will come.\u2019 So it\u2019s blaming the victim. This is the psychology a lot of Muslim women go through \u2013 they have to cover because they\u2019re responsible for someone\u2019s else\u2019s actions.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/03/we-feel-empowered-saudi-women-relish-new-freedoms\">'We feel empowered': Saudi women relish their new freedoms</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The dress code for women has changed in Saudia Arabia, she adds. Women are encouraged not to be completely covered. \u201cBut a lot of women still cling to that because that is taught from the beginning that is what makes them good and chaste and noble.\u201d</p> <p>The film, I think, has demythologising effect, too. It\u2019s a lesson to audiences in the west that behind the abayas and the veils, the women of the Middle East are modern citizens of the world. \u201cSaudi women are sassy and very resourceful,\u201d says Al-Mansour. \u201cYou try to buy a carpet from a Saudi woman; she will take all your money. They are very savvy. \u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2f362a51332a177dd3a103df95ebdee8fd40d330\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f362a51332a177dd3a103df95ebdee8fd40d330/0_0_4096_1716/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mila Al Zahrani as Maryam in The Perfect Candidate.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"419\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mila Al Zahrani as Maryam in The Perfect Candidate.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Al-Mansour gives the impression of being a natural-born rebel. She grew up in small conservative town, and describes herself as a shy kid, the eighth of 12 children in a liberal house. Her father was a poet. Where does the rebellious streak come from? \u201cMy parents,\u201d she answers quickly. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have money, but I feel really privileged. I was respected. My father and my mother never told me: \u2018Because you are a woman you can\u2019t do this.\u2019\u201d Music filled the house, and as teenager she watched Jackie Chan and Bollywood movies. \u201cWhenever I told people at school I listened to music, they\u2019d be like: \u2018You\u2019re going straight to hell. I don\u2019t want to play with you.\u2019 So, I felt like an outsider.\u201d</p> <p>After studying literature at the American University in Cairo, she got a marketing job at a Saudi oil company. \u201cIn meetings they would never listen to me. I was invisible.\u201d Al-Mansour began her career in film by making a short films with her siblings. In 2005, she met Neimann at a screening of one of her documentaries at the US embassy in Saudi Arabia where he was working as a cultural attache. When he was posted to Australia, she studied film in Sydney and wrote the script that became Wadjda.</p> <p>Right now, Al-Mansour\u2019s plan is to make films in Saudi Arabia and the west. She arrived in Hollywood at the right time, she tells me. \u201cI get a lot of chances. I get a lot of meetings. I have a chance now to build a resum\u00e9 that allows me, hopefully, in a couple of years to direct a really big movie with a big budget.\u201d Would she be up for making a blockbuster? She raises an eyebrow, surprised I would even ask the question. \u201cYes! I think I can make an amazing $100m film. Ten years ago, that would be unheard of, for a film-maker like me who\u2019s not white and who\u2019s not American, who\u2019s not a man.\u201d</p> <p>#MeToo and #OscarSoWhite have made real and meaningful differences for women such as Al-Mansour. \u201cWhat happened with Harvey Weinstein was a wake-up call. All the misogyny that we took for granted is not acceptable any more. There is the intention for improvement and it\u2019s up to us women film-makers to take opportunities and run with them and work really hard and show the world what we\u2019ve got.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 The Perfect Candidate is released in the UK on digital download (<a href=\"https://www.curzonhomecinema.com/film/watch-the-perfect-candidate-online\">Curzon Home Entertainment</a>, <a href=\"https://player.bfi.org.uk/rentals/film/watch-the-perfect-candidate-2019-online\">BFI Player</a>, <a href=\"https://greatmodernthings.com/item/the-perfect-candidate\">Modern Films</a>) on 27 March</p>",

  "<p>On Monday, Donald Trump announced he would seek to \u201creopen large sections of the country\u201d by Easter with the aim of easing Covid-19\u2019s economic impact, a move public health experts say would risk escalating the pandemic. What is the worst-case scenario if physical restrictions are loosened, and why is it mistaken to think the cure is worse than the disease?</p> <h2><strong>Would it be possible to \u2018reopen\u2019 the country in two weeks\u2019 time?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Dr Greogry Poland: </strong>We won\u2019t reopen in April. The number of new cases we\u2019re seeing now in the United States is increasing by almost 50% every day. We are on the steepest part of the curve right now. What we\u2019re seeing is a reflection of transmission two to four weeks ago, which means whatever you\u2019re seeing now, it will be significantly higher and worse in a few weeks.</p> <p><strong>Dr Robert J Kim-Farley: </strong>We want to avoid what I call the second wave. It would occur if we prematurely dropped our guard \u2013 this physical distancing \u2013 too soon.</p> <p>It\u2019s possible we might be able to be more nuanced in our approach to physical distancing, and that once we have more extensive testing, and we can truly ensure that [certain] areas do not have community transmission occurring, then those people could potentially go back to work. But [they\u2019d need to be] under a microscope. Public health officials would need to frequently test to ensure there is no introduction into that community.</p> <p>But in our densely populated areas, like Los Angeles or New York, places that have already seen major spiking of the epidemic, it would just not be appropriate epidemiologically, from a public health viewpoint, to begin to relax any of the physical distancing measures while we\u2019re still seeing an uptick of the outbreak.</p> <h2><strong>If we did reopen, what could happen?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Poland: </strong>It doesn\u2019t make any sense to loosen restrictions during an epidemic. You\u2019re fundamentally choosing economics over our lives. Let\u2019s say you live in a community with a 200-bed hospital. They have five to 10 ICU beds, half of which are used for heart attacks and everything else. So maybe they have five beds and five ventilators. If you admit one person a week, you can give great medical care. If you admit 20, 50, or 100, mortality rates shoot up.</p> <p>It means your hospitals are overrun. People are on carts in the hallways, and they die in the hallway waiting for medical care. There aren\u2019t enough ventilators, IV fluids, doctors and nurses. It\u2019s a scenario you never want to see. So if everybody goes back to work, people start dying in droves.</p> <h2><strong>How many cases might we see without significant interventions?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Poland: </strong>The CDC has <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/us/coronavirus-deaths-estimate.html\">released</a> what they think would be a worst-case scenario: 160 to 210 million people infected by December, 1 million hospitalized, and somewhere between 200,000 and 1.7 million dying. Imperial Medical College has really come up with some very dire projections. One is that they\u2019re projecting an <a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf\">eightfold demand</a> higher than what can be met by the medical system.</p> <h2><strong>When can we start to relax physical distancing?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Kim-Farley: </strong>We\u2019re going to have to have robust testing, so we truly know what is happening in the community \u2013 not just those who are getting [sick], but even what\u2019s happening silently. Once we think we have a good understanding of who is getting the disease, we could isolate those persons and their close contacts. Once we get to a point where we think we can contain the disease, then I think it would be the appropriate time to start taking off the physical distance controls.</p> <h2><strong>What do you say to people who think the cure \u2013 physical distancing and business closures \u2013 is worse than the disease?</strong></h2> <p><strong>Kim-Farley: </strong>We have to err on the side of protecting human life. So we should not rush back to business as usual, at the expense of a second wave. That indeed could be a tsunami that would endanger many more lives.</p> <p><strong>Poland: </strong>I tell them to go on the internet. Go look at the South African Olympic gold medalist swimmer [Cameron van der Burgh], who says he has never been hit as hard with something in his life.

  "<p>In the week that I speak to Amy Poehler, three different friends have told me that they are planning to rewatch Parks &amp; Recreation to distract them from what\u2019s happening in the world. \u201cI hear that a lot,\u201d says the star of the show, the woman who played the irrepressibly upbeat civil servant Leslie Knope, for 10 years and 125 episodes.</p> <p>Poehler is the kind of comedian, writer, actor and director who has plenty of \u201cbest known for\u201d roles to choose from. She joined the cast of Saturday Night Live in 2001 and her and Tina Fey, who played the Sarah Palin to her Hillary Clinton, became the first female duo to flank the famous Weekend Update of the show. Then came Parks &amp; Recreation, a workplace comedy that became so popular it was able to introduce a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/13/fashion/weddings/galentines-day-is-everywhere-heres-why.html\">whole new holiday, called Galentines\u2019 Day</a>, into the calendar on 14 February.</p> <p>Poehler is holed up at home in Los Angeles when I call. \u201cOne must try to be a good citizen at this time,\u201d she says, Knope-ishly. She is happy to talk about the soothing effects of one of her most famous roles. \u201cLeslie would not do well with quarantine,\u201d she laughs. \u201cShe\u2019d probably go a little bananas.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/may/14/how-we-made-parks-and-recreation-amy-poehler-nick-offerman-mike-schur\">How we made Parks and Recreation, by Amy Poehler, Nick Offerman and Mike Schur</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Recently, Poehler watched some old Parks &amp; Rec episodes and found a couple of them to be particularly prescient. \u201cIn one, there\u2019s a government shutdown. This woman stood up in a town hall meeting and said: \u2018My children are getting out of school in two weeks. What am I supposed to do with them, keep them in my house where I live?\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s an episode where everybody in town gets the flu and I was thinking: \u2018Oh boy, this is a little close to home.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Parks &amp; Rec ended in 2015, which left Poehler free to write, direct and produce, as well as act. She has several projects on the go: Moxie, the YA adaptation she directed for Netflix; the second season of the brilliant <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/dec/11/best-tv-shows-2019-no-7-russian-doll\">Russian Doll</a>, which she co-created but which is now on hold (\u201cSeason two is written and ready and we\u2019re so excited to get started shooting that\u201d). Should the ceremony go ahead, she and Fey will return to host the Golden Globes in January. We are here to talk about Duncanville, the new animated series Poehler created with The Simpsons\u2019 writers Mike Scully and Julie Thacker Scully, about the life of Duncan, a very average 15-year-old boy.</p> <p>\u201cThere is so much pressure on kids to be very special,\u201d Poehler explains. \u201cMike and I were always laughing about it. We are Gen X-ers; when we were growing up, no one told you you were special.\u201d How easy was it to get inside the head of a teenage boy? \u201cShockingly easy,\u201d she laughs. \u201cEverything is very exasperating at that age, because you have very little control, but there\u2019s a lot of people that are asking you what do you want to do with your life \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of pressure to do the right thing.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5b40e30625dc20bc9b62e50c66b70a0e51857906\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b40e30625dc20bc9b62e50c66b70a0e51857906/0_0_3600_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Duncanville.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"583\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A still from Duncanville.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is new territory for Poehler to be voicing a teenage boy. \u201cI am such a fan of the iconic female voices voicing young boys, whether it be Nancy Cartwright doing Bart, or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2019/jul/14/pamela-adlon-better-things-is-about-hope-and-love-amid-the-darkness\">Pamela Adlon in King of the Hill</a>,\u201d she says. The show is not only about Duncan \u2013 it also touches on his relationships with his dad (voiced by Modern Family\u2019s Ty Burrell), his sister, his cool-girl crush, Mia (played by Parks and Rec alumni Rashida Jones), and his mother, Annie.</p> <p>Poehler also plays Annie, which means she often has to deliver both sides of a disagreement. \u201cIt\u2019s really fun to play Duncan and his mom arguing with each other. [Although] maybe to people watching it, it\u2019s unsettling?\u201d she laughs. She feels like both characters in equal measure. \u201cI relate to the 15-year-old in me and and everyone who just wants to lie down in the mall while their parents go shopping for boring stuff, and I also really relate to Annie, because she\u2019s afraid of a lot of things, she\u2019s afraid for Duncan, she\u2019s trying to get him motivated.\u201d</p> <p>When it came to casting Mia, Poehler says she only wanted Jones. \u201cWith a lot of my friends, the only time I get to see them as I work with them.\u201d</p> <p>Poehler and Jones still celebrate Galentines\u2019 Day \u2013 the platonic celebration of female friendship made popular by their characters in Parks &amp; Rec. This year, they met up with Parks &amp; Rec castmates Aubrey Plaza and Kathryn Hahn. Poehler won\u2019t take credit for the term \u2013 Michael Schur wrote the episode it appears in \u2013 \u201cbut it\u2019s awesome to add another fake holiday to the fake holiday canon, and I personally think it\u2019s much more fun than Valentine\u2019s Day\u201d.</p> <p>Given that so many people seem to be turning to Parks &amp; Rec for comfort, is there anything that Poehler herself is finding solace in? </p> <p>Old British comedy, it turns out. \u201cYou know the old Julia Davis, Rob Brydon one, where they play all those couples?\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2009/jul/17/human-remains-comedy-rob-brydon\">Human Remains? \u201cOh my God, </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2009/jul/17/human-remains-comedy-rob-brydon\">so funny!</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2009/jul/17/human-remains-comedy-rob-brydon\">\u201d</a> It can feel strange talking about television at a time like this, but, as Poehler says, comedy is \u201ca very wonderful connector and distractor \u2026 Let me just put it this way, these characters don\u2019t know that a pandemic is going on,\u201d she says. Our time is up, so she says goodbye, still laughing at the thought of Brydon and Davis. \u201cI\u2019m gonna go back and watch it again right now.\u201d</p> <p><em>Duncanville airs on Channel 4 from 27 March</em></p>",
  "<h2>Top story: US Senate passes $2.2tn stimulus</h2> \n<p>Hello, I\u2019m Warren Murray, taking at least a little bit of the distance out of your day.</p> \n<p>The chancellor, Rishi Sunak, is expected to announce today that the taxpayer will <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/uk-government-set-to-pay-self-employed-workers-80-of-earnings\">pay self-employed workers up to 80% of their recent earnings</a>. Sunak has been under growing pressure to do more for the UK\u2019s 5 million self-employed after announcing an unprecedented job retention scheme for employees last Friday.</p> \n<p>In the last few hours the Senate has voted yes to a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/25/senate-passes-coronavirus-stimulus-package\">$2.2tn economic rescue package</a> that is the biggest of its kind in US history. The House of Representatives is expected to vote on Friday. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, saluted the \u201cbipartisan agreement\u201d and \u201cwartime level of investment\u201d. The minority leader, Chuck Schumer, said: \u201cThis is not a moment of celebration, but one of necessity.

Harvests and the outlook for staple crops are good but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/mar/26/coronavirus-measures-could-cause-global-food-shortage-un-warns\">problems could quickly appear in the coming weeks</a>, Maximo Torero, chief economist of the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, told the Guardian. \u201cNow is not the time for restrictions or putting in place trade barriers. Now is the time to protect the flow of food around the world.\u201d Gordon Brown, the former Labour PM and chancellor, has urged world leaders to create a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/26/gordon-brown-calls-for-global-government-to-tackle-coronavirus\">temporary form of global government</a> to tackle the medical and economic crises caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

The reversal by Brenton Tarrant came as a shock with the entire country under lockdown.

The powerful wind shapes the weather and ocean currents in the southern hemisphere. It was sent off course \u2013 tracking southwards and disrupting weather patterns \u2013 by depletion of the ozone layer due to manmade chlorofluorocarbons and hydrochlorofluorocarbons. The chemicals, found in fridges, aerosols and industrial processes, were phased out from 1987 under the UN Montreal protocol. The jet stream has since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/25/global-efforts-on-ozone-help-reverse-southern-jet-stream-damage\">stopped moving south</a> and the \u201chole in the ozone layer\u201d has shrunk to its smallest size since 1982. Alexey Karpechko, a reviewer of the study, said: \u201cThis is good news, definitely. It shows our actions can stop climate change. We can see coordinated action works \u2026 we can manipulate the climate both ways: in a wrong way and by reversing the damage we have done.\u201d</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Crisis in Kosovo politics \u2013 </strong>Kosovo\u2019s government has fallen after only 50 days in power after the prime minister, Albin Kurti, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/kosovo-government-falls-in-vote-of-no-confidence\">sacked a minister</a> who came from the junior party in the coalition. Parties have two weeks to try to form a new government before an early parliamentary election has to be called. Kurti\u2019s government will continue in a caretaker role. Kosovo was part of Serbia until an 1998-1999 armed uprising by ethnic Albanians triggered a Serbian crackdown.

This is a salient detail from the nation\u2019s ultimate dietary role model, whose MO is to show not tell; normally his lunch is way more balanced.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4a763febb5d71f26d1dbc1de743798832444888a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a763febb5d71f26d1dbc1de743798832444888a/0_64_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Wicks\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Let\u2019s get physical \u2026 Mia and Jack, two of Wicks\u2019s audience of millions.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian West/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He is keen to stress that this is no overnight success. The Instagram videos built up over two years, from 2014 when he was an obscure and incredibly bouncy personal trainer, shaking pans about, being cute about broccoli (\u201cbaby trees!\u201d) and wild about rice, to 2016, post his first book, when he had a million followers. He is quite down on his early broadcasts, describing his voice as monotonous and critical of the lighting. \u201cNo one that probably really loved cooking, like really skilful chefs, would have watched those,\u201d he says. \u201cThey were for general people who wanted to know where to start.\u201d But there was something distinctive about them, an unstudied inclusiveness</p> <p>It was in 2016 that he started visiting schools, up and down the country, trying to embed a passion for physical jerks. He wanted to teach the world to star jump; he wanted a TV show, like Jamie Oliver\u2019s School Dinners but for exercise. He could not get any takers. But that was then. Yesterday, he was in discussions with Channel 4 about streaming his <a href=\"https://www.thessun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/11247329/joe-wicks-channel-4-daily-workout/\" title=\"\">online workouts</a> while the Sun was poring over his videos, trying to spot evidence of a lavish lifestyle from the shots of his living room in Richmond, Surrey.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a very modest house,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople just focus on the stupidest things. I mean, look: it\u2019s a nice kitchen, but it\u2019s not anything fancy. It\u2019s because I won\u2019t do an interview with them, that\u2019s why.\u201d Hmmm, the last person who said they\u2019d never do an interview with the Sun was a Labour leadership candidate, I say a little slyly. \u201cI don\u2019t do politics,\u201d he says, laughing; his mind is on a larger goal. \u201cI want to be the person who completely transformed the health of the nation.\u201d</p> <p>I do not think Wicks has a particular fitness secret: his workouts are successful because people love him. This is the mystery of the man \u2013 why is it that people, across generations, like him so much? It is not a question that you can ask directly. You have to go back to the beginning.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I had quite a chaotic home life, it wasn\u2019t stable, my diet wasn\u2019t great.</p> <footer> <cite>Joe Wicks</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A disruptive and naughty kid, \u201ca bit of a clown\u201d, he says, Wicks was always into sport, football, cross-country, anything where he could blow off a bit of steam. The defining moment of his teenage years was when, at 15, a group of his schoolmates was taken on an immersion day at St Mary\u2019s University, in Twickenham, London. \u201cI remember looking round the bus, and it was all the naughtiest kids, the ones who were always in detention. I think they must have wanted us to see how it could be different.\u201d</p> <p>On the way home, he rang his mum and announced that he wanted to be a PE teacher \u2013 and he did start as a teaching assistant, before becoming a personal trainer. It was not an obvious trajectory, he says. \u201cI had quite a chaotic home life, it wasn\u2019t stable, my diet wasn\u2019t great. I was never an overweight child, but I had behavioural issues. I think that was linked to my upbringing and not having a great start with my nutrition.\u201d</p> <p>His mother was 17 when she had his brother, 19 when she had Joe; his father was in and out of rehab for drug addiction. \u201cThere was a lot of shouting, a lot of doors slammed, we didn\u2019t sit down and have dinner together.\u201d And yet, he says: \u201cOne thing I had more than anything, I had love and support from my mum and dad. My mum used to say: \u2018I don\u2019t care if you become a dustman or a doctor, you can be who you want.\u2019\u201d It is a powerful and unusual stance, and it means he really gets imperfection \u2013 human frailty, too much sugar, not enough lunges \u2013 he gets that you can make poor choices without being a bad human being, he is palpably non-judgmental, without ever saying: \u201cI\u2019m not here to judge you.\u201d I think viewers can smell that, at any age, even through their smartphones.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f9442d098a044c00b5eedc527030c7446bf671e0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f9442d098a044c00b5eedc527030c7446bf671e0/0_339_3796_4742/801.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Wicks\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Get shorty \u2026 Wicks tones his arms.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris McAndrew Photography Ltd/Chris McAndrew</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There is also, of course, the impossible to ignore eye-candy element, which meant in his early career he was often seen on the covers of fitness magazines displaying his washboard torso. He is quite uncomfortable about that now. \u201cI am a dad and I am married and I\u2019m very public about my love for my wife [Rosie, who used to be a model]. So the attention has shifted, it\u2019s less: \u2018We love him because he\u2019s got abs\u2019, the heartthrob days are over.\u201d</p> <p>Anyway, he says: \u201cI\u2019m 34 now, receding hairline, I\u2019m not as lean as I was.\u201d Which is stretching things a bit, since to the untrained eye, he looks the same, only more famous. But he is certainly serious about his family. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice calm feeling, since I got married and had kids [a daughter of two, a three-month-old son]. I\u2019m not chasing anything, I\u2019m not rushing to get anywhere, I\u2019m really content with what I\u2019ve got. When you\u2019ve got a nice house and you\u2019ve got your kids and you\u2019ve got your holiday, what more do you need? There isn\u2019t much more that will ever make you happier than that.\u201d If you have to pretend to be going bald to damp down the passions of a whole nation <a href=\"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-8148875/How-Juicy-Joe-Wicks-keeps-mums-like-half-sane.html\" title=\"\">who refer to you as \u201cJuicy Joe\u201d</a>, I guess that\u2019s a price worth paying.</p> <p>Anyway, back to the fitness; there is a good reason to start with younger kids. Before coronavirus hit, when he was still touring the country, \u201cI went to a secondary school, and they were already a little bit too cool: \u2018I\u2019m not training with him, who is this dude?\u2019 My whole philosophy is to get kids exercising at a young age, which you can really create with role modelling. \u2018My mum\u2019s sweating, she\u2019s out of breath, she\u2019s laughing.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Take a sedentary teen, who is into their devices, and good luck training them, he says. This might be disheartening news if you already have a house full of sedentary teens who are all into their devices, but he continues persuasively, and by the end of it I\u2019m convinced that you probably could persuade even older kids, so long as you directed them his way and didn\u2019t try to role model it by sweating yourself. \u201cIt\u2019s just about happiness,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve stepped away from exercise to look good, exercise to lose weight. True motivation comes from how exercise makes you feel. If you\u2019re very demotivated, you\u2019ve got to remember that the sense of achievement comes at the end of the workout, not at the start.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I don\u2019t think about financial gain. What makes me feel good is parents wanting to exercise with their kids</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As much as Wicks proselytises fitness, he is careful to show his flaws. \u201cPeople like the fact that I\u2019m out of breath when I\u2019m training, or I\u2019ll have a blowout, I\u2019ll do a little choccy run. I make mistakes, I\u2019m constantly learning.\u201d Even though he has had the ultimate social-media start, born on Instagram, raised by Facebook, he hasn\u2019t fallen into the trap of presenting an idealised version of himself, then having to meet the expectations he has raised. \u201cYou can put on a front, but people see through that very quickly, and they disengage.\u201d He never sounds censorious, even while he is describing his meal plans for the day \u2013 oats and berries, omelettes and salad, vegetable curries in the evening \u2013 and sketching out the unutterable wholesomeness of his mood management.</p> <p>\u201cThere are days when I wake up feeling flat, I don\u2019t know why,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not unhappy but I\u2019m not happy. I know, if I feel like that, I\u2019ll go and do a workout and it will lift my mood.\u201d His workouts sail forth on this tide of infinite enthusiasm, which it is hard not to get swept up in. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you believe in the energy and the secret?\u201d he says at one point. I have no idea what this means, so I say that yes I most definitely do. \u201cI do believe,\u201d he elaborates, \u201cthat the more you put out into the universe, the more that comes back.\u201d</p> <p>If the positivity is a bit relentless, it is definitely not unthinking. He allows in anxieties: small, medium-sized, vast. He worries whether he is as patient as he possibly could be at the dinner table, about how personal trainers are going to get through this hibernation period when they are all self-employed. \u201cThey really need some love. If you can\u2019t find what you want from my channel, type in yoga for the elderly, or pilates for pregnancy: there\u2019s millions of trainers also doing really good videos.\u201d</p> <p>Since he had children, \u201cI have days when I start thinking about the Earth, about pollution, about the sea, about the economic stuff. I\u2019ve started to think about what it\u2019s going to be like in 50 years, and I didn\u2019t used to think like that at all.\u201d It has made him more driven, he says, but not for money. \u201cI\u2019m proud of what I\u2019ve achieved, yes. You have to understand I grew up on a council estate, and back in the day you had tokens for your lunch at school. I didn\u2019t come from a background of wealth, but it wasn\u2019t something I talked about, I still had a good life. And I\u2019m still not motivated to be financially successful. I don\u2019t look at the numbers, or think about financial gain. What makes me feel good is reaching people, trying to change the culture so that parents want to exercise with their kids.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/sep/25/yoga-adriene-mishler-youtube-interview\">'The people\u2019s yogi': how Adriene Mishler became a YouTube phenomenon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I think back to how stung he was when the Sun picked over his living room for signs of poshness.

He has just moved all the furniture out so there\u2019s room for press-ups, and there is a map above the mantelpiece. \u201cIt\u2019s a plastic map!\u201d, he says, mock-scandalised.</p> <p>He asked me at the start of the interview whether I was Zoe Williams the media doctor, and I said no, but I was once invited to give a keynote to the Royal College of GPs, and because of my weird ego, I exchanged loads of emails on my thoughts about general practice, before my Mr said: \u201cIt\u2019s possible they don\u2019t mean you.\u201d He has a version of that story, and it\u2019s much better. \u201cMy brother got invited to do a speech at an event at YouTube for the Who. He\u2019s a massive fan of the Who, he\u2019s been listening to their music for years. The day before, he thought: \u201cWhy do they want me there?\u201d And it was only the World Health Organization.\u201d It\u2019s a signal of how big Joe Wicks was, even before the online workouts, that the WHO wanted his brother, Nikki, who is also his social-media strategist, to talk through how best to improve the world\u2019s health.</p> <p>Even while he is in no way blase about the lockdown \u2013 worrying not just about personal trainers, but about people with businesses, families in debt, how we will adapt to not being able to get the ingredients we\u2019re used to, the stuff we thought we relied on \u2013 he is constitutionally oriented towards the bright side. \u201cI think the real value that people get from my YouTube videos are these questions.

I think there are certain people that would like it to do financially poorly because they think that would be very good as far as defeating me at the polls.\u201d</p> \n<p>The president added: \u201cI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s so, but I do think it\u2019s so that there are people in your profession that would like that to happen. I think it\u2019s very clear that there are people in your profession that write fake news.\u201d</p> \n<p>Gesturing around the briefing room with his hands, he said: \u201cYou do. She does.

On Wednesday he reiterated his call for restarting the economy at Easter, even though US infections have now topped 60,000 and scientists have warned of disastrous consequences for public health.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s time,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople want to get back to work.

Nature day, or Sizdah Bedhar, is celebrated on the 13th of the first month of the Persian new year, marking the end of the Nowruz celebrations before a return to work.

The government has been widely criticised within Iran for not taking more stringent measures earlier, but Rouhani repeatedly claiming the crisis was under control pointed to statistics on declining numbers of rail journeys and cancelled hotel bookings to claim the guidance was largely being followed.</p> \n  <p>The President also said only a third of government employees should be in work, with a large proportion of those permitted to work being health workers. He said more than 1.2m of the 2.5m government employees would continue to be kept away from work.</p> \n  <p>Claiming the coronavirus pandemic was about to enter a second phase in Iran, he praised those Iranians that had abided by advice and not travelled to holiday resorts during Iran\u2019s new year break, but there is clearly a concern that the pandemic will spread again when millions return from their holidays. The ability of Iran to track those with the infection is limited, and promises by the army to clear the streets have been made before, only for little to happen.</p> \n  <p><strong>Rouhani also claimed the issue of US economic sanctions on Iran was set to be raised at the UN Security Council</strong>. The head of the Central Bank of Iran claimed Iran had made progress in being allowed to repatriate its assets in overseas banks to purchase medicines following fresh guidance to banks.</p> \n  <p>The US has claimed it has allowed Iran to purchase medicines, but banks have been wary of financing the deals.</p> \n  <p>Rouhani has already announced that prisoners released on furlough will now not be required to return to jail at the beginning of April, as originally planned, but instead the end of the April, an implicit admission that the pandemic is going to take longer to control than originally hoped.</p> \n  <p>There is widespread distrust within Iran of official daily government figures on the numbers killed or infected by the disease.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-25T10:35:59.319Z\">at 10.35am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7b30148f08af215f6facfa\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/sarahboseley\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-25T10:22:31.169Z\">10.22am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>China\u2019s tough lockdown and social distancing measures in Wuhan and other provinces appear to have successfully ended coronavirus infections</strong> and may chart a route back to normal life, according to a report from the University of London\u2019s Imperial College, <strong>Sarah Boseley</strong>, the Guardian\u2019s health editor, reports.</p> \n  <p>The report, from Prof Neil Ferguson and his team who have been the main modellers of the epidemic for the UK and other governments, suggests it is possible to lift the social distancing restrictions, as China has begun to do, without a resurgence of the epidemic. </p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3ebd852246f24d35a28a35b9ed674d9cf9f0d862\"> \n   <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ebd852246f24d35a28a35b9ed674d9cf9f0d862/0_0_4000_2667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Residents get out of a bus in Wuhan, China, on Wednesday after the public transport was partly resumed in the city\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n   <figcaption> \n    <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Residents get out of a bus in Wuhan, China, on Wednesday after the public transport was partly resumed in the city.</span> \n    <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP via Getty Images</span> \n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Prof Chris Donnelly of Imperial and Oxford Universities, one of the team, said:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>At this difficult time, these results suggest that, after containment, a carefully managed and monitored relaxation of effective large-scale lockdowns may be possible even before an effective vaccine is available.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Ferguson said their analysis \u201cprovides some hope for countries currently in various levels of lockdown that once case numbers are brought to low levels, it might be possible to relax social distancing \u2013 provided equal measures to limit the risk of the resurgence of transmission are introduced.\u201d</p> \n  <p>But, he stressed, relaxing the lockdown policies would depend on \u201crapid and ubiquitous testing and rigorous case and contact isolation policies\u201d. </p> \n  <p>That would mean testing everyone with symptoms and following up and isolating their contacts, in order to stamp out any further flare-ups of infection.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-25T10:32:28.171Z\">at 10.32am GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7b2cf58f081e5eda23656b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-25T10:13:14.329Z\">10.13am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Restrictions on movement brought in to curb the spread of the coronavirus are <strong>preventing aid from reaching refugees and displaced peoples</strong>, the Norwegian Refugee council has said. </p> \n  <p>The organisation said 300,000 refugees in the Middle East are among those who it is not able to reach, as it called on governments to relax border restrictions for the delivery of humanitarian aid.</p> \n  <p>Appealing to world leaders, Jan Egeland, the NRC secretary general, said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>While governments are taking tough and much-needed measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus, millions of refugees and displaced people still depend on humanitarian assistance.

disease, such as coughing or shortness of breath, before being referred for testing.</p> \n  <p>The change is a response to a backlog of 40,000 cases awaiting testing, and an additional 20,000 people per day seeking testing, which has \u201ccast the net too widely\u201d.</p> \n  <p>The chief medical officer, Tony Holohan, said this had led to inappropriate testing and the goal now was to focus on people in hospital, healthcare workers and other priority categories.</p> \n  <p>Of 17,992 tests carried out so far 6% have tested positive. Authorities hope in coming weeks to increase capacity to 15,000 tests a day.

But Robert Jenrick, the communities secretary insisted that sites could remain open where social distancing is observed and claimed it was essential for infrastructure works to continue and dangerous cladding to be removed from buildings.</p> \n  <p>Those sites that cannot operate within the rules should shut immediately, he said in a round of broadcast interviews.</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There will be construction sites where following the government guidelines is possible.

Germany and France have been criticised in recent weeks for imposing export bans on some of these products.

claiming success in controlling the outbreak which just one month ago saw thousands of confirmations a day.</p> \n  <p>However, residents and analysts have questioned the near-zero rate of community transmissions, expressing concern that the Chinese government is prioritising economic recovery over total virus containment. </p> \n  <p>The low figures have led Chinese authorities to lift stringent travel restrictions in Hubei, effectively freeing millions of people from two months of extraordinary lockdown.</p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a

Temples, gurdwaras and mosques, usually overflowing with life, stood silent.</p> \n  <p>The lockdown will have a particularly calamitous impact on the 300m Indians who live below the poverty line, and exist hand to mouth. The reality of a lockdown for the tens of millions who live on the streets; for the swathes of large families who live crammed into a single room often with no ventilation or running water; and for the rickshaw drivers who live in their rickshaws and rely entirely on their daily income is likely to be devastating.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e7abfe18f081e5eda236337\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/davidsmith\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-25T04:14:52.168Z\">4.14am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <h2>Trump seeks to reopen \u2018large sections\u2019 of US by Easter, clashing with experts</h2> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\" style=\"background-color: rgb(246, 246, 246);\">Donald Trump</a> is aiming to reopen \u201clarge sections of the country\u201d by Easter, he told reporters on Tuesday, as officials advised anyone who has recently left New York to self-quarantine for two weeks.<br></p> \n  <p>The US president has put himself on collision course with his own health experts by floating a deadline for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/trump-vows-to-open-up-our-country-even-as-deaths-from-coronavirus-rise\">firing up the economy</a>, claiming without evidence that the current shutdown would cause more deaths than the coronavirus itself.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI hope we can do this by Easter,\u201d Trump told reporters at an unusually brisk White House briefing. \u201cI think that would be a great thing for our country.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Asked if that timeline \u2013 12 April \u2013 was realistic , he replied: \u201cWe\u2019re going to look at it.
