Trump\u2019s supporters could shrug aside the WHO\u2019s fancy talk and say that everyone knows the outbreak started because of China\u2019s appalling treatment of animals, and the Chinese Communist party then added the suppression of news to its list of crimes by hiding the outbreak\u2019s existence.</p> <p>However much critics may want to say Trump is a semi-senile fool \u2013 and I do \u2013 it is worth remembering that he remains a brilliant political operator, who has destroyed all opponents within and without the Republican party who made the mistake of underestimating him.

If the virus is China\u2019s fault, then domestic critics of his administration are traitors aiding the Chinese communists. You think I\u2019m exaggerating? On 16 March, Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/marklevinshow/status/1239529127415291904?s=20\" title=\"\">tweeted a link</a> to an article on the paranoid <em><a href=\"https://thefederalist.com/2020/03/16/the-atlantic-must-stop-covering-for-the-chinese-communist-party/\" title=\"\">Federalist</a></em><a href=\"https://thefederalist.com/2020/03/16/the-atlantic-must-stop-covering-for-the-chinese-communist-party/\" title=\"\"> site</a>. The author, one Madeline Osburn, was explicit. <em>The</em> <em>Atlantic</em>, a serious American magazine, had joined \u201cChina\u2019s anti-American disinformation efforts\u201d, she said. Osburn, who would have had a glittering career on the <em>People\u2019s Daily</em> if she had been born Chinese, cited the work of <em>The</em> <em>Atlantic</em>\u2019s Anne Applebaum, without appearing to know that Applebaum has written <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Anne-Applebaum/e/B001IQULQS\" title=\"\">two devastating histories</a> of the atrocities of communism. <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/coronavirus-showed-america-wasnt-task/608023/\" title=\"\">Describing</a> how the pandemic has exposed America\u2019s weaknesses in general, and its president\u2019s weaknesses in particular, made Applebaum a useful idiot at best and traitor at worst, Osburn said.</p> <p>The presidential retweet was not a one-off. By 19 March, Trump was saying in public that journalists who asked hard questions were \u201c<a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/oan-reporter-chanel-rion-asks-incredibly-bonkers-softball-question-at-trump-coronavirus-presser\" title=\"\">siding with China</a>\u201d. On 31 January, Trump had boasted: \u201cWe pretty much shut it down coming in from China. We have a tremendous relationship with China, which is a very positive thing.\u201d By last week, he was counting on his supporters to have forgotten all that. This is how a failed presidency and failed political movement fights when it is in a corner.</p> <p>The hope that events will justify your beliefs is an ineradicable delusion. Surely, now the British will see through Johnson, liberals say, rather than blindly rally to his government in a time of crisis. Surely, the Americans will toss Trump on the scrap heap in November. But political battles do not win themselves. Democrats still have to unseat a sitting president \u2013 a feat they have not managed since 1992. Labour still has to turn itself from a serial election-loser into an election-winning machine. As the US shows, coronavirus can become the \u201cChina virus\u201d. And what seems an irrefutable argument for a comprehensive welfare state can become an excuse for nationalist tricksters to wrap themselves in their tattered flags. </p> <p>\u2022 Nick Cohen is an Observer columnist</p>",
  "<p>It is always dangerous when facing a crisis to invoke war as an analogy. War is chaos. War, as Thomas Hobbes and those with personal experience know, is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2009/may/15/religion-philosophy-leviathan\" title=\"\">limitless death and destruction</a>. By definition, it comprises uncontrollable, random events occurring in a vacuum when the laws and conventions that bind people and societies in peacetime no longer apply.</p> \n<p>Politicians, scientific experts and commentators who now routinely resort to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/06/coronavirus-hype-crisis-predictions-sars-swine-flu-panics\" title=\"\">wartime metaphors</a>, images and language to describe the battle against Covid-19 do so at their peril.

Boris Johnson, another man who never wore uniform, suggests the country is fighting a second Battle of Britain. Cringeworthy newspaper headlines summon up the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/19/myth-blitz-spirit-model-coronavirus\" title=\"\">blitz spirit</a>\u201d, recycling 1940\u2019s propaganda.</p> \n<p>In some key respects, a war and a pandemic do pose similar challenges and require similar responses. In Albert Camus\u2019s 1947 novel, <em>La Peste</em> (The Plague), the initially unbelievable spread of a lethal disease in a small town serves as an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/jan/05/albert-camus-the-plague-fascist-death-ed-vulliamy\" title=\"\">allegory for human suffering</a> in the fascist era. \u201cWe find it hard to believe in a pestilence when it descends upon us,\u201d he wrote. Camus continued: \u201cThere have been as many plagues in the world as there have been wars, yet plagues and wars always find people equally unprepared. When war breaks out, people say: \u2018It won\u2019t last long, it\u2019s too stupid.\u2019 And war is certainly too stupid, but that doesn\u2019t prevent it from lasting. Stupidity always carries doggedly on.\u201d</p> \n<p>War is not only stupid. It is by its nature divisive. And divisions spawned by Covid-19 are everywhere: in last week\u2019s ugly blame game between the US and China; in the closing of Europe\u2019s and America\u2019s borders to \u201cforeigners\u201d; in the failure, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-crisis-leaders-failing-gordon-brown\" title=\"\">as Gordon Brown says</a>, of the international community to join forces effectively.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/mar/21/home-office-releases-300-from-detention-centres-amid-covid-19-pandemic\">Home Office releases 300 from detention centres amid Covid-19 pandemic</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The language of war divides communities.

If there is a strong message of faith to be found in the anxiety, misery and death attendant on the pandemic, it has yet to be widely heard. This is a secular war, waged in temporal time.</p> \n<p>As in past global conflicts, rivalrous allies are competing for postwar advantage.

I wanted to use myself as a case study to say, even as somebody who escaped the worst things that can happen to women, I was still so profoundly impacted and here\u2019s what it looked like.</p> <p><strong>You felt that the threat of male violence was so pervasive that at times you wanted to become invisible</strong><strong>: is that what the title is about?</strong><br>I think there\u2019s a dread and a constant presence in your imagination if you\u2019re a young woman, of: \u201cI can\u2019t wear this, I can\u2019t go here, I can\u2019t be out at this hour, I can\u2019t trust this person, I have to watch whether this will lead to something uncomfortable or dangerous.\u201d I wanted to connect that to the broader question of how this particular form of assault on women\u2019s agency and choice also takes place in other more polite arenas, like publishing. So it felt like this was a very particular story of how I found a voice, and also a very generic story of what it means to be a woman in a society that doesn\u2019t want women to have a voice.</p> <p><strong>Was it harder or more painful to write than your previous books?</strong><br>It wasn\u2019t the painfulness so much, it was more that it felt like a very artless book. And it felt ugly in a way, because I was talking about some of the worst things that had happened to me and my natural impulse is to want to give people something beautiful. It was interesting because this was so personal that it felt like I didn\u2019t know what I was doing and whether it was any good.</p> <p><strong>You grew up with a family background of domestic violence but you don\u2019t talk about that in great detail here \u2013 why not?</strong><br>I feel that we as a culture have talked about domestic violence and there have been lots of memoirs of childhood abuse. It\u2019s not very interesting to me, in that I feel there\u2019s no new light to be shed. I feel like we haven\u2019t talked about what I really wanted to talk about in this book, which is this ambient threat of harassment, so I chose to begin it with me at 19.</p> <p><strong>Were you prepared for the way your essay </strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/06/mansplaining-explained-expert-women\" title=\"\">Men Explain Things </a></strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/06/mansplaining-explained-expert-women\" title=\"\">to Me</a></strong><strong> reached such a huge audience?</strong><br>Absolutely not. I had no idea it would resonate with so many people because that experience was so ordinary and so infuriating. More than infuriating, it was really interfering with women being able to testify to what happened in a personal situation, or being able to be respected in their professional capacity. In relating my own perception of a really common experience, I stumbled on something that was really significant in a lot of women\u2019s lives.</p> <p><strong>That piece went viral; do you feel that social media has been a force for good in giving people a voice?</strong><br>I\u2019ve never felt like I can weigh up the two sides. I think the people who own Google and Twitter and Facebook have chosen to violate our privacy, monetise our personal data, they\u2019ve chosen to tolerate propaganda, disinformation, corruption of elections. A lot of really good people have used these technologies for good, back to the Arab spring and Occupy Wall Street, but the people who own them and profit from them don\u2019t give a damn about human rights and democracy, or equality of voice and accuracy of information. There are so many reasons why Donald Trump is president but I think a large part of it is social media and the vulnerabilities they created for all sorts of forms of misinformation.</p> <p><strong>Your 2016 book </strong><em><strong>Hope </strong></em><em><strong>in </strong></em><em><strong>the Dark</strong></em><strong> gave encouragement to progressives during the Iraq war and again after the Trump election. Have you always been an optimist?</strong><br>I was a pretty depressed young person. I came to the idea of hope as an activist and a writer of history, seeing that things were better than we were often told, that actually ordinary people can have a great deal of power and often succeed in using it in ways that change the world for the better. I have to say the last few years have dampened my hopefulness a bit, not just because of runaway climate change and Donald Trump, but because the kind of collective madness that allowed Donald Trump to happen.</p> <p><strong>Your UK tour has been cancelled because of the pandemic. Are there writers or artists </strong><strong>whom you turn to when things are bleak</strong><strong>?</strong><br>There are specific writers and poets I find encouraging \u2013 I read Jack Gilbert, Robert Hass, Philip Levine. But I\u2019m also always looking out for what\u2019s happening around me that contains some sense of possibility, or where something positive is taking place. For example, how do we come together in mutual aid in a time of quarantine? But I was so looking forward to coming to the UK and I was agog at the idea of being in conversation with Mary Beard.

Sanders <a href=\"http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/2003/15/se.03.html\">contended</a> the pandemic laid bare \u201cthe incredible weakness and dysfunctionality\u201d of the US healthcare system, and called for single-payer reform. Biden countered that Italy\u2019s universal system had failed to protect the Mediterranean nation, and asserted that Covid-19 \u201chas nothing to do with Bernie\u2019s Medicare for All\u201d. At first glance, the ex-vice-president seems right: of course single-payer can\u2019t close the door to a novel virus, any more than it can forestall a deadly earthquake or fend off a zombie apocalypse. Nonetheless, a national health program with unified financing and governance \u2013 basically the opposite of what we have in America today \u2013 is a powerful tool in a health crisis.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/20/coronavirus-italy-lessons-countries-crisis-information\">Coronavirus has taught Italy hard lessons. Other countries must learn from us | Maurizio Molinari</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The debate over Medicare for All in the age of Covid-19 is complicated by the fact that it is our public health agencies \u2013 and not the medical care system \u2013 that serve as our first line of defense against novel epidemics. In that regard, we\u2019ve shot ourselves in the foot with a 12-gauge shotgun: <a href=\"https://www.modernhealthcare.com/government/report-public-health-funding-falls-despite-increasing-threats\">year after year of underfunding of</a> our <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4695931/?holding=hulib\">federal, state</a><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4695931/?holding=hulib\"> and local public health agencies</a> has left us <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/17/trump-sees-the-coronavirus-as-a-threat-to-his-self-interest-not-to-people\">ill-prepared</a> for the Covid-19 challenge (as evidenced by the testing fiasco). How we finance medical care, however, is also critical. On the most basic level, containing the coronavirus will require those infected to seek medical care, so that they can be diagnosed and isolated. Fear of devastating ER or hospital bills, however, could keep some home \u2013 or at work. As a Taiwan government spokeswoman, lauding her country\u2019s single-payer system for its successful containment of Covid-19, told <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/what-taiwan-can-teach-world-fighting-coronavirus-n1153826\">NBC News</a>, \u201cTaiwan\u2019s health insurance lets everyone not be afraid to go to the hospital. If you suspect you have coronavirus, you won\u2019t have to worry that you can\u2019t afford the hospital visit to get tested.\u201d</p> <p>On Wednesday, Trump signed into law a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/19/818322136/heres-what-is-in-the-families-first-coronavirus-aid-package-trump-approved\">bill</a> that would make Covid-19 testing \u2013 but not treatment \u2013 free. It\u2019s hence inadequate, given the predicted looming surge in hospitalizations from Covid-19 pneumonia. After all, 30 million Americans are uninsured \u2013 a number that will surely grow as the economy tanks and millions or tens of millions of Americans lose their jobs. Even more are underinsured, and for these individuals, co-pays and deductibles will only become more unaffordable as disposable income falls and savings dwindle. For both groups, medical bills for an intensive care unit (ICU) stay for Covid-19 could be devastating. People, of course, will also not stop having heart attacks, cancer or traffic accidents during this outbreak \u2013 on the contrary, medical needs are likely to rise in the face of a recession, as unemployment and misery takes its toll on the nation\u2019s health. Financial ruin from medical costs \u2013 whether it stems from Covid-19 pneumonia or the looming Covid-19 recession \u2013 is financial ruin all the same, and will compound the harm of the epidemic.</p> <p>But there\u2019s more to it than that. We need single-payer not only to protect us from healthcare costs, but to transform our healthcare infrastructure. In recent weeks, you may have heard that the US, despite our high healthcare spending, has fewer hospital beds per capita than many other wealthy nations. You may have also heard in recent years about an epidemic of hospital closures in poorly served rural areas, or the <a href=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/hahnemann-hospital-medicare-for-all/\">2019 closure</a> of a major academic safety-net hospital in Philadelphia. These hospitals closed not because they are unneeded, but because they are unprofitable. For the American hospital landscape is shaped by market forces, which largely determine where hospitals grow and where they wane.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Healthcare in America is uncoordinated \u2013 and ungoverned</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At the same time, while our hospital bed supply is relatively low, our ICU bed supply per capita is among the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22777516\">highest in the world</a>. Yet those beds aren\u2019t necessarily where they need to be: a 2010 study in the Journal of American Medical Association, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20388892\">for instance</a>, found large regional disparities in the distribution of ICU beds; the researchers concluded that in the face of a major epidemic, some areas might have empty beds, while others would have too few. Again, this distribution, far too often, is driven by market logic \u2013 not health needs.</p> <p>Finally, healthcare in America is uncoordinated \u2013 and ungoverned. Since the epidemic\u2019s onset, hospital and city and state governments have waged \u201cbidding wars\u201d over crucial supplies and ventilators, the New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/opinion/war-crononavirus-trump-production.html\">noted</a>. It\u2019s every hospital for itself: some are resorting to <a href=\"https://komonews.com/news/coronavirus/seattle-childrens-hospital-asking-community-for-medical-mask-donations\">pleas to the community</a> for donations of masks; presumably, others are well-stocked \u2013 but who knows? \u201cRespirators, ventilators, all of the equipment \u2013 try getting it yourselves,\u201d Trump suggested to state governors on Monday, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-respirators.html\">quoted</a> by the New York Times. This is not a healthcare system \u2013 it is atomized chaos. For again, in the American way of paying for healthcare, our hospitals (or increasingly, our multi-hospital systems) are silos, some rich and some poor, each fending for themselves, locked in market competition.</p> <p>This is neither necessary nor rational, leading both to excess and shortfalls, to generous overall health system funding yet care that remains unaffordable for many. A single-payer national health program would allow us to move past the market-driven status quo to remake this chaotic healthcare landscape of simultaneous healthcare plenty and poverty. It would, in short, allow us to begin to plan \u2013 not merely for this epidemic, but for the one that follows.</p> <ul> <li><p>Adam Gaffney is an instructor in medicine at Harvard Medical School and a pulmonary and critical care doctor at the Cambridge Health Alliance.

  "<p>As the Trump administration and lawmakers in Washington debate cash payments to support Americans during the coronavirus crisis, the mayor of one California city that has experimented with universal basic income has advice.</p> <p>Early findings from Stockton, California, which launched a basic income experiment last year, may offer American policymakers some reassurance \u2013 and a few notes of caution.</p> <p>It\u2019s \u201cheartening\u201d to see a national focus on providing direct cash assistance, said Michael Tubbs, Stockon\u2019s 29-year-old mayor, who championed the city\u2019s basic income experiment. But some choices in the current Republican plan make little sense to him, Tubbs said. \u201cIf someone was struggling more than others before a crisis, why should they get less help during a crisis that is going to hit them harder? It defies logic,\u201d he said.</p> <p>On Thursday, the Republican Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, proposed legislation to give middle-income Americans a single, $1,200 payout for each adult, plus $500 for each child in a family. The payments decrease for Americans who earn more than $75,000 a year, and individuals who make more than $99,000 will get nothing. The lowest-income Americans also get less: the plan includes a smaller, $600 payment to adults in some of America\u2019s poorest families. Democratic lawmakers are calling for Americans to receive larger, recurring cash payments, with at least one plan calling for <a href=\"https://khanna.house.gov/media/press-releases/release-reps-ryan-khanna-propose-cash-infusion-between-1000-6000-help-working\">a monthly check</a> of between $1,000 and $6,000.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We have to make sure that the most marginalized, the most impacted, the folks who were struggling the most before this pandemic get help</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe have to make sure that the most marginalized, the most impacted, the folks who were struggling the most before this global pandemic get help and relief,\u201d Tubbs said.</p> <p>Stockton launched its guaranteed income experiment, the first in modern US history, in 2019. Since that February, 125 local residents in the economically challenged city have received $500 a month to spend on whatever they choose.</p> <p>The idea of providing a universal basic income to citizens is not new, but it has found new supporters in recent years, as some tech industry leaders have embraced \u201cUBI\u201d as a possible response to rising inequality and a growing number of American jobs lost to automation. The Facebook co-founder <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/20/america-guaranteed-income-chris-hughes\">Chris Hughes</a> is among the proponents of the policy; the Economic Security Project, which he co-chairs, is helping fund basic income experiments in Stockton and elsewhere.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/andrew-yang-coronavirus-universal-basic-income-interview\">'$1,000 per person should be the baseline': Andrew Yang on direct payments during coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Early data from the Stockton experiment is promising, according to the two researchers who are running the evaluation of the program.</p> <p>\u201cIf you give people free cash, how do they spend it? They\u2019re very rational about it, and they make great decisions,\u201d said Stacia Martin-West, an assistant professor at the University of Tennessee College of Social Work and one of the lead researchers.</p> <p>Direct cash payments are more flexible than a one-size-fits-all government program, and they allow people to adapt to changing needs and new crises. \u201cEveryone we talked to, there was a different way they would use $500, and they all made sense,\u201d Tubbs, the Stockton mayor, said. \u201cThere was no way, as a government official, I would be smart enough to think of all that.\u201d</p> <p>One participant used the money to pay for dentures, Tubbs said. Another was able to take time off work to interview for a better job that paid more and had shorter hours. Participants have talked about finally having the money to buy their kid a sports uniform or a prom dress, or to move to <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/156584/can-500-month-change-life\">a safer neighborhood.</a></p> <p>But the single largest category of spending among Stockton participants so far: food. Nearly 40% of tracked spending monthly went to feeding the recipients and their families.</p> <p>That number highlights the degree of basic \u201cfood insecurity\u201d that Americans have been living with since even before the current crisis, said Amy Castro Baker, an assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania and the other lead researcher on the project.</p> <p>The Stockton researchers also found that participants were using their additional cash to invest in healthier food choices for themselves and their kids, additional evidence that the barrier for lower-income Americans to eat healthier is not education about what they should and should not be eating, but access to affordable, high-quality food.</p> <p>Scaling a direct cash payment program nationwide during a pandemic could end up having broader public health benefits, beyond just preventing the spread of the virus, Baker said. It could give more Americans the resources to eat healthier meals. If lawmakers provide continuous payments, reducing residents\u2019 fears about being able to make it through the crisis, their lower levels of anxiety could also lead to better overall health outcomes.</p> <h2>\u2018As long as the crisis lasts\u2019</h2> <p>As policymakers in Washington debate which Americans to exclude from direct cash payments, and whether they should send just one check, or two or three, Tubbs, the Stockton mayor, encouraged them to think bigger.</p> <p>Direct cash payments should last \u201cas long as the crisis lasts, and even a little bit after\u201d, Tubbs said.</p> <p>Receiving $500 or $1,000 monthly isn\u2019t much during a global pandemic that has destroyed the economy, Tubbs said: \u201cIf they were working two or three jobs, this is not replacing what they made, this is enough to let them get by.\u201d</p> <p>Martin-West and Baker, the researchers evaluating the Stockton experiment, agreed that an effective program of national cash payments needed to match the scale and scope of the problem. That means payments should go out immediately, within 10 to 14 days; they need to recur throughout the crisis; and they need to reach Americans with as few bureaucratic hurdles as possible.</p> <p>Since the 2008 recession, \u201cthe average household has not recovered,\u201d Baker said. Banks got bailed out, the stock market boomed, but the government did not do enough to help most Americans.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we have now is an entire economy of people living paycheck to paycheck because they were left out,\u201d Baker said. \u201cWe have been a house of cards for a really long time, and it wasn\u2019t going to take much to blow it over.\u201d</p> <p>A big, sustained program of direct cash payments was a chance for the American government to \u201ccourse-correct\u201d and make up for the failures of the 2009 bailout, she said.</p> <p>How big and how sustained? A good benchmark for the size of the checks the government should send to Americans now, Martin-West said, might be some common financial wisdom.</p> <p>\u201cThe advice that we\u2019ve all heard for how to be financially savvy is: you\u2019re supposed to have three months of income saved up. If we look at the median income for Americans, that would mean $7,500 in the bank,\u201d she said.</p> <p>That benchmark would mean supporting Americans with roughly $2,500 per month throughout the crisis. \u201cAt minimum, a year of those cash transfers would be ideal,\u201d Martin-West said.</p> <p>Lawmakers need to specify in the legislation that the coronavirus payments do not count as income that could later disqualify low-income families from receiving food stamps, or other continuing government assistance, the researchers said. If lawmakers fail to do that, families could lose their eligibility for other programs, hurting them more over the long run.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019re in an unprecedented crisis, so we have to have big thinking. This is a New Deal type moment</p> <footer> <cite>Michael Tubbs</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>While both Republican and Democratic plans call for reducing or even eliminating direct payments to higher-income Americans, Tubbs also said that he believes payments should be \u201ccloser to universal\u201d since \u201cthe crisis will impact everyone.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know what the difference between [an income cutoff of] $99,000 and $100,000 is, especially at at time when we\u2019re laying people off and shutting down industries,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The two researchers suggested that the federal government should channel money to Americans through multiple programs, to make sure they reach everyone in need. Why not increase the amounts of existing welfare and disability payments, as well as using tax records to send taxpayers cash?</p> <p>But even large direct cash payments aren\u2019t a substitute for other kinds of government action, they cautioned. Other solutions are needed during the coronavirus crisis, including paid sick leave and better healthcare. In Stockton, the guaranteed income pilot has made clear that more money is not enough to help residents deal with systemic problems, like California\u2019s lack of affordable housing.</p> <p>Baker also questioned why the McConnell legislation was benchmarked against Americans\u2019 2018 tax returns, when so many Americans, including freelancers and gig economy workers, see their incomes change dramatically over time.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/20/america-coronavirus-recession-universal-basic-income\">America is in crisis.

A single mom who spends most of her time caring for a child with a serious disability, for example, might not make the income cutoff for a full $1,200 check, even though she\u2019s \u201ccertainly going to be struggling in the middle of a public health crisis\u201d, Martin-West said.</p> <p>Not all lawmakers are onboard with even a single direct cash payment to Americans, and some key Senate Republicans expressed reservations about McConnell\u2019s plan on Thursday, including Lindsey Graham, an influential Trump ally.</p> <p>But merely focusing on increasing unemployment insurance, as Graham has suggested, Tubbs said, would leave out too many people who might not fit the criteria for unemployment, including women doing domestic and caregiving work, freelancers, barbers and hairdressers, and Lyft and Uber drivers.</p> <p>Americans needed both more unemployment insurance and direct payments, Tubbs said, not one or the other.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re in an unprecedented crisis, so we have to have big thinking,\u201d Tubbs said \u201cThis is a New Deal type moment, in terms of the recession that\u2019s bound to come from this public health epidemic, which we haven\u2019t seen in at least a century.\u201d</p> <p>Tubbs said he was not surprised that direct cash payments were having a national political moment, and he said that work to make the idea mainstream has already been done, including by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/20/andrew-yang-coronavirus-universal-basic-income-interview\">Andrew Yang</a>, the entrepreneur and Democratic presidential primary candidate, who made UBI his central policy issue in his bid for the White House.</p> <p>\u201cI think folks like myself, and people like the Economic Security Project, people like Mr Yang, have taken the brunt of the criticism,\u201d Tubbs said. \u201cI think now it\u2019s really a safe space, particularly because we\u2019re in a crisis.</p> <p>\u201cThere were a lot of people who were living in an economic pandemic before the corona crisis,\u201d he added.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 26 March 2020 to correct a mistake that said White Policy instead of White House.</p>",
  "<p>Long before the arrival of Covid-19, the speed and contents of the news had made me feel almost overwhelmed with fear. Faced with a flood of images that includes migrant children in cages, melting glaciers and forest fires, it has felt impossible to process information, let alone assess the best way to react.</p> <p>We\u2019ve entered an era characterised by the twin forces of speed and instability, in which a superabundance of potential threats \u2013 running from Islamic State to nuclear war, the rise of the far right, Brexit, environmental catastrophe and now a global pandemic \u2013 is matched by a dearth of time in which to process them. It\u2019s impossible to keep up, and far too alarming to look away. Thanks to the accelerating effects of social media, it\u2019s begun to seem as if the social landscape is shifting at such a rate that thinking, the act of making sense, is permanently balked. It\u2019s increasingly difficult to distinguish real danger from rumours, speculations, conspiracy theories and deliberate lies, a process the spread of coronavirus around the globe has only intensified. Logging into Twitter or following the rolling news has meant being trapped in a spin-cycle of hypervigilant anxiety.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If this virus shows us anything, it\u2019s that we\u2019re interconnected, just as Dickens said. We have to keep each other afloat</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>During this febrile period, I\u2019ve found myself longing for a different kind of timeframe, in which it would be possible both to feel and to think, to process the intense impact of the news and perhaps even to imagine other ways of being. The stopped time of a painting, say, or the dilations of the novel, in which it is possible to see patterns and consequences that are otherwise invisible. Art has begun to feel not like a respite or an escape, but a formidable tool for gaining perspective on what are increasingly troubled times.</p> <p>Can art do anything, especially during periods of crisis? In 1967, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/05/george-steiner-obituary\" title=\"\">George Steiner</a> wrote a famous essay about the deficiencies of art in the wake of the Holocaust. He argued that if a concentration camp commander could read Goethe and Rilke in the evening and still go about their duties at Auschwitz each day, then art had failed in its highest function, which he defined as the ability to humanise. The problem with this argument is that it implies for art to be successful it must act as a magic bullet, effortlessly reorganising moral faculties; in effect obliterating free will.</p> <p>Art can\u2019t forcibly induce a change in behaviour. It\u2019s not a re-education pill. Empathy is not something that happens to us when we read <em>War and Peace</em>. It\u2019s work, for which art can, however, provide us with radiant materials. Art can\u2019t win an election or bring down a president. It can\u2019t stop the climate crisis, cure a virus or raise the dead. What it can do is serve as an antidote to times of chaos. It can be a route to clarity, and it can be a force of resistance and repair, providing new registers, new languages in which to think.</p> <p>One of the problems with the internet as a source of information is that there is no end, no definitive conclusion to be reached. You travel link by link, pursuing digressions and counter-claims, interrupted by continuous breaking updates. The novel, by contrast, is a technology of orderly revelation, slowing and speeding time so as to trace connections and consequences down into hours, minutes, seconds, or out into decades, even centuries.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"dc6e5902fe3521b0e8efbec34020b4e94ab47dca\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc6e5902fe3521b0e8efbec34020b4e94ab47dca/0_111_2050_1230/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The TV adaptation of Bleak House.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The TV adaptation of<em> </em>Bleak House.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Mike Hogan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dickens is the master of this, and it strikes me that there can\u2019t be many better figurations for what information-gathering feels like on social media than Krook\u2019s Rag and Bottle shop in <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/12/charles-dickens-bleak-house-book-that-changed-me\" title=\"\">Bleak House</a></em>. This \u201cgeneral emporium of much disregarded merchandise\u201d is overflowing with indeterminate objects, among them blacking bottles and pickling bottles, heaps of parchment scrolls, rags and hundreds of rusty keys. Buried somewhere in this maddening chaos is, or might be, a vital document, without which clarity and justice will never be achieved.</p> <p>There\u2019s a plague in <em>Bleak House</em> too, the hyper-contagious smallpox virus, which serves to underscore Dickens\u2019s larger argument about interconnection, his determined attempt to show that social classes are not inviolate or impermeable, and that no group of people, no matter how grand or rich, are truly separate from their neighbours, no matter how poor or abject. The fever doesn\u2019t respect titles or addresses, racing indiscriminately from the London slum of Tom-All-Alone to Bleak House itself. Esther catches it because she insists on helping the abject, homeless orphan Jo, shivering and stumbling from ditch to doorway, always being moved on. Realising she too is sick, she establishes herself in rigorous quarantine, knowing that by locking the door on her dear friend Ada, she is carrying out an act of love. \u201cAs she loved me and wished my mind to be at peace,\u201d she instructs, \u201ccome no nearer than the garden\u201d: the tender message of self-isolators everywhere.</p> <p>One of the pleasures of <em>Bleak House</em> is that it\u2019s a drama about the act of information-gathering itself, slowly and laboriously producing clarity and order out of lies, misinformation and occlusion. Back in the early 1990s, the critic and queer studies pioneer Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick wrote an illuminating essay about this vexed and essential process. Sedgwick was once described by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/27/the-agronauts-maggie-nelson-observer-review\" title=\"\">Maggie Nelson</a> as \u201cfat, freckled, prone to blushing, bedecked in textiles, generous, uncannily sweet, almost sadistically intelligent and, by the time I met her, terminally ill\u201d. She wrote \u201cParanoid Reading and Reparative Reading, or, You\u2019re So Paranoid, You Probably Think This Essay Is About You\u201d at the centre of the Aids crisis, at a time when many of her closest friends and colleagues were dying difficult and painful deaths, and she herself was undergoing treatment for the breast cancer that later killed her.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>That\u2019s the thing about utopias, they keep you going, in a way that reading The Road does not</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Though it was written predominantly for an academic audience, \u201cParanoid Reading\u201d is about something that affects us all, which is how we approach knowledge and uncertainty, as we do constantly in the course of our daily lives, and particularly at times of disaster or rapid political change. Sedgwick begins by describing the paranoid approach, so common and widely practised that we sometimes forget there are alternatives to it.</p> <p>A paranoid reader is concerned with gathering information, tracing links and exposing secrets. They anticipate and are perennially defended against catastrophe and disappointment. They\u2019re always on the lookout for danger, about which they can never, ever know enough. Paranoia can be an appropriate mode in circumstances like those we\u2019re in now, when knowledge is crucial and swift reactions matter. As the poet Anne Boyer observes in a much-shared essay about coronavirus, \u201cfear educates our care for each other \u2013 we fear a sick person might be made sicker, or that a poor person\u2019s life might be made even more miserable, and we do whatever we can to protect them because we fear a version of human life in which everyone lives only for themselves. I am not the least bit afraid of this kind of fear, for fear is a vital and necessary part of love.\u201d</p> <p>The difficulty lies in gauging the level and amount of information it\u2019s useful to acquire. How much does the average citizen need to know about epidemiology or viral loads? Does the accumulated store of possible scenarios help a person to act safely or does it paralyse their capacity to act at all? Furthermore, how much of what is read is true, and how much is being used to convey a more sinister message, like Trump\u2019s constant harping on a \u201cforeign\u201d virus, his deployment of a disease to broadcast propaganda about closed borders? At their worst, Twitter, Facebook and the like can be a factory for manufacturing speculation and mistrust, in which material travels more rapidly the more frightening it is, providing comprehensive evidence for hopelessness and dread.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"be5b0ebd9e8a69e57cb30b91ea04c659cfbdd02d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/be5b0ebd9e8a69e57cb30b91ea04c659cfbdd02d/0_0_4254_4278/994.jpg\" alt=\"Derek Jarman\u2019s Modern Nature is an account of building his famous garden on the beach in his final years.\" width=\"994\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Derek Jarman\u2019s Modern Nature is an account of building his famous garden, see below, on the beach in his final years.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Krause, Johansen/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sedgwick\u2019s essay arose out of a conversation in the mid-1980s with her friend Cindy Patton, an activist-historian of the Aids epidemic. At the time, there were rumours that Aids might have been deliberately engineered by the US military. Sedgwick was excited to hear what Patton thought and startled by her reply. \u201cSuppose \u2026 that the lives of Africans and African Americans are worthless in the eyes of the United States; that gay men and drug users are held cheap where they aren\u2019t actively hated; that the military deliberately researches ways to kill non-combatants whom it sees as enemies; that people in power look calmly on the likelihood of catastrophic environmental and population changes,\u201d she said. \u201cSupposing we were ever so sure of all those things \u2013 what would we know then that we don\u2019t already know?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"adef2942164cda507e8cfdcc6c3728ae35eac6c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/adef2942164cda507e8cfdcc6c3728ae35eac6c3/0_251_5079_3047/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jarman\u2019s cottage at Dungeness in Kent.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jarman\u2019s cottage at Dungeness in Kent.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Bird/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What Sedgwick took away from this \u201ccongenial pessimism\u201d, which strikes a definite echo with the present day, is that it isn\u2019t always necessary to track down every piece of information about a crisis in order to respond effectively to it. Patton\u2019s statement made her realise that there are other valid concerns for the artist, the activist, the citizen faced by emergency or disaster. At the very end of her essay, she briefly, tantalisingly floats another possible approach, which is more concerned with creativity and repair than the so-called hermeneutics of suspicion.</p> <p>A useful analogy for what Sedgwick terms the \u201creparative\u201d is to be fundamentally more invested in finding nourishment than identifying poison, a drive she locates in artists as diverse as the realist painter Jack Smith, artist Joseph Cornell, film-maker John Waters and <em>Nightwood</em> author Djuna Barnes. This is not the same thing as being naive or heedless, unaware of crisis or undamaged by oppression. Instead, it\u2019s about being driven to find or invent something new and vital out of inimical environments. \u201cWhat we can best learn from such practices,\u201d Sedgwick explains, \u201care the many ways selves and communities succeed in extracting sustenance from the objects of a culture \u2013 even of a culture whose avowed desire has often been not to sustain them.\u201d</p> <p>Sedgwick\u2019s faith in art was hard-won, and derived in part from the crucial role it played during the plague years of the Aids crisis. In contrast to the rapid international public health response to coronavirus, the first cases of \u201cgay cancer\u201d in California and New York in 1981 were met with apathy and derision. In 1984, by which time 5,596 deaths had occurred in the US and it was estimated 300,000 people had been exposed to the virus, the Reagan press officer was still responding to questions about the epidemic by joking about the journalist\u2019s possible infection status. Reagan himself didn\u2019t say the word \u201cAids\u201d until 17 September 1985. By the end of that year, 12,529 people had died.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/dec/29/fiction-to-look-out-for-in-2020\">Fiction to look out for in 2020</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In such a situation, visibility mattered. In 1987, a six-person collective of artists in New York created the \u201cSilence = Death\u201d graphic, which became the international logo of Aids activism. This stark phrase was emblazoned in white letters on a black background beneath a pink triangle, taken from the insignia homosexuals were made to wear in concentration camps. It served to brand the call to arms, a crisp refutation of stigmatisation and homophobia.</p> <p>If silence equalled death, then part of the work of resistance was to make the fact of enforced silencing visible, as well as conveying something of the damage it caused. In 1989, the American artist and Act Up activist David Wojnarowicz posed for a famous photograph. He gazes furiously at the camera, his lips sutured with five loose stitches. Three thin trickles of blood run down his chin. In this distressing image, hurt and repair are fused. The needle works through flesh, self-inflicted wounds announcing larger harm.</p> <p>In our own era, the act of lip-sewing has been adopted by refugees. I\u2019ve seen photographs of refugees with stitched lips made on the border between Greece and Macedonia, in an Australian immigration centre in Papua New Guinea, in Athens; all places where borders are closed to certain bodies and free passage is impeded. In these cases, the image possesses an uncanny power. It can travel where the body can\u2019t. It migrates and strays, taking up permanent residence in the mind, revealing what \u2013 who \u2013 has been forcibly excluded from sight.</p> <p>The desire to unveil hidden cruelty is also at work in a series of performances about rape carried out in the early 1970s by the Cuban-American artist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/sep/22/ana-mendieta-artist-work-foretold-death\" title=\"\">Ana Mendieta</a>, while she was still a student at the University of Iowa. In 1973, a nursing student was brutally raped and murdered in campus housing. It took months before there was an arrest, and during that frightening period, Mendieta took it upon herself to create work about the attack, conveying her own horror, as well as drawing attention to the invisible epidemic of violence against women. In the first of these performances, she invited her fellow students to her apartment. When they arrived, the door was ajar. Inside, there was lavish evidence that a horrible crime had been committed. Mendieta was tied to the table, half-naked, her underwear around her ankles. Blood dripped on the floor. The students stayed an hour and for the entire time she didn\u2019t move a muscle.</p> <p>Mendieta was working right at the beginning of second-wave feminism, when it was still possible to believe in the power of revelation, the shock tactics of re-enacting violence as a vaccination, a homeopathic cure. But by the 1990s, Sedgwick was already beginning to wonder whether there wasn\u2019t something weirdly naive about placing faith in this kind of unveiling, \u201cas though to make something visible as a problem were, if not a mere hop, skip, and jump away from getting it solved, at least self-evidently a step in that direction\u201d. As if violence is not titillating to certain appetites; as if the expression of pain cannot be consumed with relish.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e8876ba6367c42864b4eea6991ca47579a5b2eb1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e8876ba6367c42864b4eea6991ca47579a5b2eb1/0_69_1503_902/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elisabeth Moss in the TV adaptation of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elisabeth Moss in the TV adaptation of The Handmaid\u2019s Tale.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: George Kraychyk/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The faith in inoculation remains, of course. In 2017, the actor Elisabeth Moss announced her irritation with people who refused to watch the ultra-violent <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-handmaids-tale\" title=\"\">Handmaid\u2019s Tale</a></em>, a dystopic fantasy that felt closer by the day. \u201cReally?\u201d she asked. \u201cYou don\u2019t have the balls to watch a TV show? This is happening in your real life. Wake up, people. Wake up.\u201d But in the age of the internet, it\u2019s very hard to think that anyone needs more evidence of violence. We\u2019re already drenched in it, and its capacity to snap us out of numbness is grossly overstated. If anything, it does the opposite, glutting the viewer with despair.</p> <p>The night before Trump\u2019s inauguration, I saw the trans poet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/feb/16/eileen-myles-learn-to-write-poems\" title=\"\">Eileen Myles</a> read their own version of a presidential address at the London Review Bookshop. The vision they unfolded was the utopian inverse \u2013 painful! thrilling! \u2013 of what Trump would say the following day. Under Myles, the White House would be a homeless shelter, there\u2019d be 24-hour libraries, free trains, free education, free food, archery for everyone; sure, why not? It felt reparative, listening to that. It felt like my imaginative ability to frame utopias and then to move purposefully towards them might have been restored, at least for a minute.</p> <p>I had the same experience when I first read <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2018/mar/27/ursula-k-le-guins-electronica-album-music-and-poetry-of-the-kesh\" title=\"\">Always Coming Home</a></em>, Ursula Le Guin\u2019s 1985 collection of stories and anthropological fragments about a future civilisation, the Kesh, living in what is now California\u2019s Napa Valley in the wake of an apocalypse that is never quite described. It was a relief to encounter such a formidable thinker using her imaginative energy, her humour and her extensive knowledge to construct a better, fairer, more environmentally sane society \u2013 its architecture, sexual arrangements, metaphors, toys, songs, clothes, medical practices and stories \u2013 rather than simply magnifying all that is worst about our own.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/feb/17/best-books-new-beginnings-jenny-colgan\">The best books about new beginnings</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That\u2019s the thing about utopias, they keep you going, in a way that reading <em>The Road</em> or <em>The Death of Grass</em> does not. Le Guin was no less concerned about the oncoming ecological crisis than Cormac McCarthy, but her approach is calmer and more infused with hope. Hope has a bad press in our cynical age, but it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean being disengaged, a Pollyanna blind to the state things are in or uninterested in how they got that way. Hope is the precursor to change. Without it, no better world is possible.</p> <p>The same year that Wojnarowicz was photographed with his needle and thread, the film-maker Derek Jarman began the diary that would become <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/apr/27/olivia-laing-derek-jarman-modern-nature\" title=\"\">Modern Nature</a></em>, an account of building his famous garden on the beach in Dungeness, Kent. Jarman was diagnosed HIV-positive in the winter of 1986, years before the invention of combination therapy made long-term survival a probability. In the face of his own oncoming death, he didn\u2019t give way to despair. Instead he elected to spend his time making this stony desert bloom.</p> <p>He planted irises and roses directly into the shingle, encouraging a riot of wallflowers and valerian, \u201call the dark humours blown away by the wind\u201d. This wild, unfenced arcadia sustained him through the political battles of his final years, and has now outlived him by more than quarter of a century. Last time I visited, in December, it was still humming with power.</p> <p>I have the same feeling when I look at photographs by Wolfgang Tillmans or read a novel by Ali Smith. I had it when I went to see my friend Rich\u2019s degree show at Goldsmiths and he\u2019d made dozens of ceramic razor clams and anemones, downed planes and nubbly coral reefs. It\u2019s a feeling of being inducted back into hope, a restoration of faith. It\u2019s easy to give into despair. There\u2019s so much that\u2019s frightening, so much that\u2019s wrong. But if this virus shows us anything, it\u2019s that we\u2019re interconnected, just as Dickens said. We have to keep each other afloat, even when we can\u2019t touch. Art is a place where that can happen, where ideas and people are made welcome. It\u2019s a zone of enchantment as well as resistance, and it\u2019s open even now .</p> <p><em>\u2022 Funny Weather: Art in an Emergency by Olivia Laing is published on 16 April by Picador (RRP \u00a320).

He\u2019s felt very confident in the president\u2019s support because he laid so much of the foundation of praise for Trump in the past. He\u2019s established he\u2019s always going to give the spotlight to Trump and he\u2019s always willing to accept the blame if necessary.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s had his chin out and he\u2019s willing to take a knock if one is coming. He\u2019s hung in there and let himself be used, and now he\u2019s of use. You still cringe as you hear him be so unctuous but you\u2019ll notice others are doing it too.\u201d</p> <p>Whatever happens in November, Pence is seen as a likely contender for the Republican nomination in 2024. D\u2019Antonio believes he has boosted his chances. \u201cIf things go poorly for Trump, Pence stands as the more serious and inspirational leader right now. If people had a problem with Pence, it\u2019s often over the idea that he\u2019s anti-science. This is doing a lot to counter that.</p> <p>\u201cOn the internet right now there are mashups that make Trump look like an idiot. But I could put together an advert for Pence in 2024 that would make him look like the hero of the coronavirus crisis.\u201d</p> <p>The vice-president\u2019s constant praise for Trump, however, incessantly peppering his remarks with the phrase \u201cthe president\u201d, is likely to win him few friends among Democrats and independents, however.</p> <p>Jeff Greenfield, a political analyst and author, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/greenfield64/status/1240312014620127233?s=20\">tweeted on Wednesday:</a> \u201cHave some sympathy for Mike Pence. I\u2019ve learned that there is an electrified belt around his waist and if he speaks for more than 7 seconds without praising the President, a White House aide presses a button and Pence suffers a painful shock.\u201d</p>",
