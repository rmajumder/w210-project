Not worth the time &amp; effort!\u201d</p> \n<p>In recent weeks Trump has used the briefings to dole out unproven and debunked medical advice, suggesting that things like sunlight and an anti-malaria drug are cures to Covid-19, often causing his own medical experts to try to correct the record.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/25/donald-trump-coronavirus-disinfectant-sarcastic-tipping-point\">Debacle of Trump's coronavirus disinfectant comments could be tipping point</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But on Friday Trump surprised observers by taking no questions and stalking out of the room after an unusually short briefing of just 22 minutes. Some took the move as an acknowledgement from Trump himself that he may have taken things too far when he said on Thursday that disinfectant could be used to cure Covid-19.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ad6c83b5-067f-4fb6-983e-2764c3175db2\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BalDN6iGYpE?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Those comments sparked shock and ridicule \u2013 and warnings from healthcare experts \u2013 and prompted Trump to make a ham-fisted attempt at a clawback when he later said he had made the remarks sarcastically \u2013 despite video proving he had not.</p> \n<p>While the press briefings are meant to give members of the coronavirus task force an opportunity to provide updates on the state of Covid-19 in the country, the attention around the briefings has been centered on Trump\u2019s use of the podium as his bully pulpit.</p> \n<p>The president has used the briefings as uncensored airtime, praising his administration for its response to the crisis while criticizing the media and Democrats for any negative comeback.</p> \n<p>Advisers close to the president told him to stop making appearances at the briefings unless special announcements needed to be made, according to multiple reports published Saturday morning. The advice comes as Trump trails Joe Biden in polls from swing states.

And the spectacle of him fighting with the press isn\u2019t what people want to see.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump has reportedly been hesitant to end his briefing appearances, Axios reported, because he said they bring in good television ratings.</p> \n<p>The president has also used the briefings as an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/18/donald-trump-press-briefing-rally-campaign-media\">opportunity</a> to rile up his base in a way that would typically be done at his rallies. Trump has criticized Democrats and attacked Biden, referring to him as \u201cSleepy Joe\u201d during briefings, veering far away from the subject of Covid-19.</p> \n<p>It is unclear whether Trump can stay away from the podium, or whether his instincts as a reality television star will kick in and the show will go on.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe\u2019s going to want to get media attention and control his message,\u201d Sam Nunberg, a political consultant who briefly worked on Trump\u2019s campaign in 2016, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/25/trump-team-2020-polling-207675\">told</a> Politico. \u201cHe is the only one who thinks he can do his message best, and that\u2019s just the reality.

We\u2019re seeing the dissemination of material claiming that immigrants spread coronavirus, and that authoritarian regimes outperform western liberal democracies in tackling the health crisis.\u201d</p> <p>Zinc Network said British far-right groups such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/28/britain-first-far-right-members-5000-have-joined-tories\">Britain First</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/feb/11/how-britains-extremist-bloggers-helped-the-alt-right-go-global\">Knights Templar International</a>, as well as the BNP\u2019s former leader, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/oct/01/nick-griffin-expelled-from-bnp\">Nick Griffin</a>, have used the crisis to promote themselves as supporters of the community during the lockdown. Griffin has posted images of himself on social media distributing food parcels.</p> <p>Zinc Network, which in the past has attracted scrutiny for its work promoting the Home Office\u2019s anti-radicalisation strategy, <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/97976/prevent-strategy-review.pdf\">Prevent</a>, studied social media posts, photos, videos, journals, official records and media reports to produce the analysis.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Their tactics are sophisticated and their activity is becoming more difficult to monitor</p> <footer> <cite>Louise Brooke, Zinc Network</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It said one key narrative being pushed by the far right is that the spread of coronavirus is the consequence of illegal immigration. Allied to this is the claim that nations with tightly-controlled borders are better prepared to deal with the pandemic. Another is the premise that modern liberal states are on the verge of collapse, and that their fall can be accelerated through armed action or by a major crisis.</p> <p>The promotion of survivalist material by far-right groups is also becoming a trend. Zinc says neo-Nazi publisher Arktos has been publishing updated and expanded editions of far-right survivalist texts.</p> <p>A favoured tactic among far-right groups is to put fake documents into circulation, designed to look like real medical or government communications. According to Zinc\u2019s monitoring, far-right Telegram channels have been instrumental in circulating a fake scan of a positive Covid-19 test for the former vice-president and Democratic presidential candidate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/24/joe-biden-donald-trump-delay-election\">Joe Biden</a>.</p> <p>The same channels have also been distributing government pandemic response documents with a view to helping would-be attackers plan their actions.</p> <p>Some far-right organisations are using the crisis to impersonate other groups, Zinc claims. Fake Extinction Rebellion flyers have been found in several cities in the UK proclaiming \u201cCorona is the cure \u2013 humans are the disease\u201d.</p> <p>Most of the leaflets condemn immigration, with some calling for the public to \u201clearn about the JQ\u201d \u2013 the \u201cJewish question\u201d. Others promote conspiracy theories or deny the Russian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/sep/26/salisbury-poisoning-suspect-is-russian-colonel-reports\">novichok attack in Salisbury</a>.</p> <p>Brooke said: \u201cThese extremist groups are using the coronavirus as an opportunity to further their ideological objectives by spreading fear and division and exacerbating social tensions.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Callout callout-coronavirus\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div data-callout-tagname=&quot;callout-coronavirus&quot;&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Callout&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;callout-coronavirus&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>",

Bank of China has not had any ownership interest in that loan since late November 2012.\u201d</p> <p>Neither the White House nor the Trump Organization responded to requests for comment. Trump has officially handed over the day-to-day running of his business empire to his sons, but he benefits financially from its profits, producing multiple conflicts of interest.

  "<p>For Donald Trump, it was the strangest and most news-making thing he could have done: instead of taking questions from journalists, dominating the nation\u2019s airwaves yet again, the US president gave a short pre-written statement and then stalked off the stage.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/25/us-coronavirus-timeline-trump-cases-deaths\">Three months and 50,000 deaths: the defining Covid-19 moments in the US \u2013 timeline</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The abrupt end of Friday night\u2019s daily press conference, which has become a ribald, unruly and often shocking ritual in America during the coronavirus pandemic, was probably the clearest sign yet of how badly Trump\u2019s bizarre statements over disinfectant have shaken his administration.</p> <p>Instead of going on the offensive after the world reacted with shock and horror to his Thursday night suggestion that the coronavirus might be treated by injecting disinfectant into a human body, Trump claimed he was being \u201csarcastic\u201d and then retreated from public view.</p> <p>The New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/24/us/politics/trump-inject-disinfectant-bleach-coronavirus.html?action=click&amp;module=Spotlight&amp;pgtype=Homepage\">reported</a> that some officials in the White House thought \u201cit was one of the worst days in one of the worst weeks of his presidency.\u201d</p> <p>But it was Trump\u2019s silence on Friday night that spoke volumes.<br><br>White House coronavirus taskforce briefings are often two-hour primetime marathons but on Friday Trump turned on his heel as reporters shouted questions in vain. Perhaps it was a fit of pique, or perhaps revenge on the reporters that he sees as persecutors. He may also have reached a tipping point, with his own advisers warning that the televised briefings are hurting him far more than they help.<br><br>Right on cue, minutes later, <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/trump-daily-coronavirus-briefings-809becf3-9913-4b71-9f92-1930ad1d29b0.html\">the Axios website reported</a> that Trump plans to \u201cpare back\u201d his coronavirus press conferences, according to four of its sources. Next week, it said, \u201che may stop appearing daily and make shorter appearances when he does\u201d.</p> <p>If he does that then Trump\u2019s remarks over disinfectant will have been the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back over the nightly ritual of the virus briefings. For weeks they have dominated the US headlines as the nation struggles to come to terms with a pandemic that has cost 50,000 American lives. They have provided a canvas for Trump\u2019s rage, a platform from which he can attack his enemies and \u2013 only occasionally \u2013 a place where an American president can seek to reassure a scared and besieged public enduring stay-at-home orders to curb the virus.</p> <p>But Trump\u2019s remarks over disinfectant changed all that.</p> <p>On Thursday, Trump had suggested that doctors study the idea of people receiving injections of disinfectant to combat the virus. He also extolled the potential and unproven benefits of ultraviolet light. Medical experts, politicians and even disinfectant makers denounced the suggestion and warned the public against consuming the product. Trump\u2019s comments generated internet memes and headlines around the world.</p> <p>His old rival from 2016, Hillary Clinton, chimed in with a quick jab on Twitter. \u201cPlease don\u2019t poison yourself because Donald Trump thinks it could be a good idea,\u201d she said. His new rival for the 2020 election, former vice-president Joe Biden, also pitched in. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I have to say this, but please don\u2019t drink bleach,\u201d he said, mixing mockery with a public service announcement.</p> <p>From almost the moment the words left Trump\u2019s mouth it was clear some sort of damage limitation was needed.</p> <p>But, as shock and amazement traversed the globe, it was slow in coming. When it did arrive, on Friday lunchtime, it was a clean-up attempt that clearly could have gone better. At a White House event Trump tried to justify his dangerous comments, falsely claiming that he was \u201casking a question sarcastically to reporters\u201d.</p> <p>On Friday, even as the US death toll topped 50,000 and the grim milestone of 1 million coronavirus cases grows nearer, Trump tried to make what critics saw as a desperate and dishonest U-turn.</p> <p>\u201cI was asking a question sarcastically to reporters like you just to see what would happen,\u201d the president, sitting at the Resolute desk in the Oval Office, told reporters as he signed emergency funding legislation.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I was asking a sarcastic \u2013 a very sarcastic question \u2013 to the reporters in the room about disinfectant on the inside, but it does kill it, and it would kill it on the hands and that would make things much better. That was done in the form of a sarcastic question to a reporter.\u201d</p> <p>But video of the briefings clearly demonstrated otherwise. There was no hint of sarcasm and Trump\u2019s attempts to rewrite the immediate past were undermined by the evidence just a simple Google search away.</p> <p>When Trump posed the question about the efficacy of disinfectant injections, he had turned to his right and was looking in the direction of Bill Bryan, the acting homeland security undersecretary for science and technology, and Deborah Birx, the coronavirus taskforce coordinator.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2781403745ca17a81608365b41ca63c031f48e2c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2781403745ca17a81608365b41ca63c031f48e2c/0_100_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump turns to the homeland security official William Bryan during the briefing at which the president extolled the virtues of ingested disinfectant.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump turns to the DHS official William Bryan during the briefing at which the president extolled the virtues of ingesting disinfectant.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: White House/Zuma Wire/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But Trump \u2013 in his attempt at damage limitation \u2013 gamely pressed on. The Reuters reporter Jeff Mason asked if Trump wanted to clarify that he was being sarcastic and ensure no one misunderstood him.</p> <p>He replied: \u201cYes. I do think that disinfectant on the hands could have a very good effect. Now, Bill is going back to check that in the laboratory. You know, it\u2019s an amazing laboratory, by the way. It\u2019s amazing the work they do.\u201d</p> <p>One more time, Mason gamely pressed: \u201cJust to clarify, you\u2019re not encouraging Americans to inject disinfectant?\u201d</p> <p>Trump: \u201cNo. Of course not. Interior-wise, it was said sarcastically. It was put in the form of a question to a group of extraordinarily hostile people, namely the fake news media.\u201d</p> <p>But Trump\u2019s familiar turf of attacking the media was not working. In the middle of a pandemic, with Americans dying in their hundreds every day, the leader of the administration trying to guide the nation back to safety and normality had put even more lives at risk. His jumbled, inaccurate assertions only deepened concerns about Trump\u2019s embrace of flawed science that could endanger public health.</p> <p>Scott Gottlieb, Trump\u2019s own former Food and Drug Administration director, was among those many people now forced to warn Americans not to follow their own president\u2019s advice. He told a CNBC interviewer: \u201cI think we need to speak very clearly. There\u2019s no circumstance under which you should take a disinfectant or inject a disinfectant for the treatment of anything, and certainly not the treatment of coronavirus.\u201d</p> <p>The scandal exploded just a day after a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/23/us/politics/coronavirus-trump.html\">New York Times report</a> that detailed how Trump is coping with the pressures and isolation caused by the coronavirus pandemic. In a lengthy piece it portrayed a US president who has become cut off from many of his former friends and associates as he lives and works in the White House, unable to leave and travel and hold the campaign rallies that he appears to crave.</p> <p>It described Trump bingeing on cable news for many hours each morning and often late into the night, surveying the wreckage of a once-booming economy that he had planned on being the main plank of his reelection strategy.</p>",

They have always been shamelessly hypocritical. However, their hypocrisy has become particularly brazen during the coronavirus crisis. On Monday, for example, Dan Patrick, the <a href=\"https://rewire.news/ablc/2020/03/25/texas-covid-19-response-ban-abortion-kill-grandma/\">virulently </a><a href=\"https://rewire.news/ablc/2020/03/25/texas-covid-19-response-ban-abortion-kill-grandma/\">\u201cpro-life\u201d</a> lieutenant governor of Texas, called for the reopening of the country, saying there are \u201c<a href=\"https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/493879-texas-lt-governor-on-reopening-state-there-are-more-important-things\">more important things than living</a>\u201d.</p> <p>This is the same guy, by the way, who went on Fox News last month and said \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/24/older-people-would-rather-die-than-let-covid-19-lockdown-harm-us-economy-texas-official-dan-patrick\">lots of grandparents</a>\u201d would rather die than see the US economy suffer.

This is the same guy who seems to see no disconnect between sacrificing old people and sermonizing about the rights of foetuses.</p> <p>I could go on and on about the hypocrisy of the anti-abortion brigade but it\u2019s pointless to do so. Politicians like Patrick (who is an evangelical Christian) don\u2019t respond to logic or reason; many of them are simply fanatics, intent on turning America into a theocracy.</p> <p>Logic and reason, more broadly, seem to have little place in American politics anymore. I mean: on Thursday Donald Trump suggested that injecting yourself with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/trump-coronavirus-treatment-disinfectant\">disinfectants might cure coronavirus</a>. We\u2019ve reached a stage where the president of America has become so unhinged that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/trump-lysol-injection-claim-maker-hits-back\">manufacturers of Lysol</a> have to urge the public not to inject themselves with household chemicals. We\u2019ve reached a level of dystopia that I\u2019m not sure even Margaret Atwood could have imagined.</p> <h2>Former Labradoodle breeder led coronavirus task force</h2> <p>Continuing the theme of \u201cAmerica has become a bizarre dystopia\u201d: <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-hhschief-speci/special-report-former-labradoodle-breeder-tapped-to-lead-u-s-pandemic-task-force-idUSKCN2243CE\">Reuters reports</a> that a senior lead on the Health and Human Services (HHS) coronavirus task force is a former labradoodle breeder with little public health experience.

But other times, these behaviors \u2026might signal that children view women in a negative light, as weak, incompetent, and unable to survive or thrive without a man\u2019s help. The study, which examined the attitudes of more than 200 children, aged five to 11, also found that benevolent sexism decreased with age only for girls. \u201cBoys may be less likely to recognize that their benevolent attitudes toward women are, in fact, patronizing.\u201d</p> <h2>Texas will allow abortions to resume</h2> <p>Abortion services have been largely unavailable for over a month after Governor Greg Abbott\u2019s 21 March executive order suspending \u201cnon-essential\u201d medical procedures.

The group now hopes to turn the anti-lockdown protests into a movement which could help re-elect Trump in November.</p> <p>The Tea Party Patriots, another group forged amid the Tea Party movement of 2009, has also weighed in, promoting the rallies to its 3 million members nationwide, while a group of gun-enthusiast activist brothers bought up webpages in an effort to further the movement\u2019s aims.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tea-party-supporters-who-they-are-and-what-they-believe/\">The Tea Party</a> supported lower taxes, but was also accused of representing a racist reaction to the election of the first black president.

On Sunday, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/20/us-protests-lockdown-coronavirus-cases-surge-warning\">he denied</a> the protesters had put people at risk.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019ve got cabin fever,\u201d Trump told reporters at a White House briefing. \u201cThey want their lives back. These people love our country. They want to get back to work.\u201d</p> <p>As Trump and Fox News, plus other rightwing outlets, cheered the Michiganders, plans for rallies in other states began to emerge. Since the Michigan effort, protests have taken place in Maryland, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Virginia \u2013 a rally organized, in part, by a Virginia gun rights group.</p> <p>Other protests, <a href=\"http://www.freedomworks.org/content/reopen-america-events-around-country\">promoted by FreedomWorks</a> and <a href=\"https://www.teapartypatriotsaction.org/weekly-action-items/action-items-for-this-week-apr-20-apr-24/\">Tea Party Patriots</a>, are planned in Alaska, Delaware and Kansas.</p> <p>Jenny Beth Martin, honorary chairman of Tea Party Patriots, stressed that the protests had not been organized by the top of the organization, but by Tea Party Patriots activists in different states.</p> <p>\u201cThey let us know about reopen events that are happening in their own state,\u201d Martin said. \u201cAs long as the event is listing that the social distancing guidelines must be followed then we are sharing the event with our supporters in the geographic area by email.\u201d</p> <p>That possibly underplays the Tea Party Patriots\u2019 influence, given it has 3 million supporters and hundreds of thousands of Twitter followers. Wall, at FreedomWorks, was also keen to stress it did not organize events, but the organization\u2019s ability to reach its 5 million members is hardly a small matter in promoting the events.</p> <p>In any case, the protests and the fawning news coverage by the rightwing media serve as a handy shot in the arm for less-publicized work both organizations are doing behind the scenes.</p> <p>FreedomWorks and Tea Party Patriots have joined with <a href=\"http://v\">the American Legislative Exchange Council</a>, a controversial rightwing network that pushes policies by creating model legislation, to create a \u201cSave Our Country\u201d coalition, which is quietly lobbying Trump to reopen the economy.

  "<p>Can a man who is both head of state and chief executive somehow not be the center of attention during a national crisis? All eyes remain on Trump. Yet the president has effectively abdicated responsibility, nationally and internationally. He is just keeping up a nightly theater of leadership \u2013 with an eye on the ratings, as opposed to the lived reality of millions of Americans for whom he cannot muster even a performance of empathy. It is time to focus elsewhere. And it is urgent for Democrats to provide actual guidance for a country in disarray.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/24/the-guardian-view-on-the-eu-and-covid-19-better-late-than-never\">The Guardian view on the EU and Covid-19: better late than never | Editorial</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Plenty of people (not least journalists) have for the longest time clung to the hope that somehow the reality TV star would become \u201cpresidential\u201d.

Others are debating whether the networks and cable channels should carry Trump\u2019s daily briefings at all.</p> <p>There is an important lesson to be learned here from a very different period in history. I mean the strategies adopted by the central European dissidents of the 1970s and 1980s (which is not to equate authoritarian state socialism with the US today). After the failure of many reform efforts, Adam Michnik and other intellectuals concluded that the oppressive regimes were never going to change. The dissidents stopped talking to state leaders and resolved instead to \u201ctalk past them\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/292994/postwar-by-tony-judt/\">as the historian Tony Judt put it</a>), trying to reach as many citizens as possible in spite of restrictions on speech. They also started to create what V\u00e1clav Benda called a <a href=\"https://www.palgrave.com/gp/book/9781349111190\">\u201cparallel polis\u201d</a> \u2013 a world in which one tried to act as if one was already free. These civil society initiatives undermined the regimes without ever confronting them head-on.</p> <p>What is the lesson? There is no point talking to Trump, because he will not change; every seemingly sober presidential moment \u2013 cheered by centrist observers \u2013 is followed by 10 puerile performances of ranting and raving. There will never be a Gotcha moment, because Trump\u2019s \u201cbase\u201d is apparently committed to him no matter what; even his diehard fans\u2019 most basic interests \u2013 such as not dying (never mind their economic interests) \u2013 will apparently not detract from their identification with a figure who, if nothing else, looks like a trustworthy general in the culture war.</p> <p>It is possible, to pick up an idea from the media critic Jay Rosen, <a href=\"https://pressthink.org/2020/04/five-improvements-in-the-design-of-coronavirus-coverage/\">to \u201cdecenter\u201d Trump</a>. True, he is the president, but he has basically informed the country that he is abdicating responsibility for the Covid-19 crisis and turning to polit-entertainment. The governors are supposed to \u201ccall the shots\u201d. The rest of the world already got the message that the United States is no longer interested in cooperating to address global challenges.</p> <p>Concretely, this means the Democrats should start doing nightly briefings and propose plans (wasn\u2019t there once someone in the primaries who was particularly good at drawing up plans?); governors could turn the fact that Trump has \u201cauthorized\u201d them to do what they want into a mandate for building a parallel polis with better policies, some of which could eventually be scaled up nationally. The fact that some do not have the resources, because Mitch McConnell would rather <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/22/mitch-mcconnell-bankruptcy-route-201008\">have blue states go bankrupt than save lives</a>, should be exposed as further proof that the Republicans have comprehensively turned into the party of cruelty.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Democrats may worry that providing alternative leadership is seen as divisive. But we are already in the campaign</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>To provide alternative leadership \u2013 and real facts, as opposed to Trump\u2019s mostly \u201calternative facts\u201d \u2013 is not the same as disputing the legitimacy of the president. When Andr\u00e9s<em> </em>Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador contested the outcome of the 2006 election in Mexico (which he narrowly lost), he declared himself the \u201clegitimate president of Mexico\u201d and had his followers camp out to protest in the middle of Mexico City. And in the weeks after the shock of November 2016, plenty of Americans declared Trump \u201cnot my president\u201d. That is a dangerous move, and mirrors Republicans who already in the 1990s referred to Bill Clinton as \u201cyour president\u201d, denying the legitimacy of their political adversaries. Trump, alas, <em>is</em> our president \u2013 he\u2019s just not acting like it.</p> <p>Democrats may worry that assertively providing alternative leadership is seen as \u201cdivisive\u201d or as \u201cpoliticizing\u201d the crisis. But like it or not, we are already in the campaign; Trump is being as divisive as ever; and, most important, an opposition ready to provide comprehensive alternatives is the heart of representative democracy. This is more obvious in parliamentary systems; think of how the leader of the opposition in the House of Commons is supposed to rise immediately after the prime minister and start rebutting.</p> <p>Some commentators have suggested Joe Biden put together a <a href=\"https://saraacarter.com/msnbc-host-suggests-biden-form-a-shadow-government-to-counter-trumps-covid-response/\">\u201cshadow cabinet\u201d</a>, following the UK example. Others have argued that Democrats should not have one spokesperson going up parallel to Trump, but instead feature <a href=\"https://www.thedailybeast.com/heres-how-democrats-can-counter-program-trumps-coronavirus-propaganda?\">a revolving set of politicians both charismatic and competent</a> (Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez would be a natural choice). What is most important is creating a sense that the opposition, in a time of crisis, is both criticizing the administration <em>and</em> offering something constructive.</p> <p>It is true that elections are today often decided <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/01/opinion/negative-partisanship-democrats-republicans.html\">more by \u201cnegative identity\u201d than by positive visions</a>; citizens vote less for something, than against someone. Many Americans have made up their mind about Trump by now; those who haven\u2019t are more likely to be impressed by his Kabuki shows of leadership and get the feeling that nobody else has a plan.

The English season will need a number of weeks to complete and I doubt there will be enough time. Seeing what is happening with things getting postponed week by week it is probably not realistic.\u201d</p> <p>The Dutch FA may still face legal action from certain clubs adversely affected by the decision to scrap the season with no champions, promotion or relegation.

Six current and former Trump advisors, including Miller, have ties to the group. </p> \n  <p>In a private call this week, Miller appeared to try and maintain restrictionists\u2019 favor by saying the ban was part of a long-term vision. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/stephen-miller-audio-immigration-coronavirus/2020/04/24/8eaf59ba-8631-11ea-9728-c74380d9d410_story.html\">According to the Washington Post</a>, Miller said of the executive order: \u201cIt is vital, it is necessary, it is patriotic and it deserves the full-throated support of everybody on this call.\u201d </p> \n  <p>The Trump administration has already made dramatic changes to immigration in the US, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/15/invisible-wall-trump-policies-have-curbed-immigration\">through policies big and small</a>. So, the vision is already in place. </p> \n  <p>This is why the ban, with its exceptions, was interpreted as a largely political move. To have it be criticized by the people it is meant to appease is a problem for Miller above all others. </p> \n  <p>In addition to the call, the far-right website <strong>Breitbart News</strong> had an exclusive story today saying the original ban was more expansive. The story also attempted to move blame for the exceptions away from Trump and some of his advisors. </p> \n  <p>\u201cIt is unclear how closely Trump reviewed this draft before signing the final executive order,\u201d Breitbart said. \u201cThe contents indicate administration staffers with views more in tune with the president\u2019s economic nationalist agenda were involved in its drafting.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Miller has had a close relationship with the website in the past and late last year, a former reporter there leaked her <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/21/stephen-miller-trump-adviser-demands-resign-fired-email-scandal\">900 email correspondence with the president\u2019s advisor.</a> The emails revealed Miller\u2019s endorsement for white supremacist views and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/22/stephen-miller-bannon-interview-immigration-america\">promotion of racist conspiracy theories.</a> </p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea341788f0845d1c895d60a\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-24T19:55:50.055Z\">8.55pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Congressional Budget Office: US deficit to reach $3.7 trillion</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The US Congressional Budget Office announced Friday that a looming recession caused by coronavirus pandemic and a spike in government spending will nearly quadruple the government\u2019s budget deficit to $3.7 trillion.</p> \n  <p><strong>From the AP:</strong></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>The 2020 budget deficit will explode after four coronavirus response bills passed by Congress and signed by President Donald Trump promise to pile more than $2 trillion onto the $24.6 trillion national debt in just the remaining six months of the current fiscal year, according to the CBO\u2019s report.</p> \n   <p>That\u2019s more than double the deficit record set during President Barack Obama\u2019s first year in office.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The CBO predicted a devastating hit to the economy this quarter at a rate of decline of 40 percent, accompanied by a 14 percent unemployment rate.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea33d3d8f0845d1c895d5f3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/davidsmith\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-24T19:34:01.840Z\">8.34pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><em>The Guardian\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?client=internal-element-cse&amp;cx=007466294097402385199:m2ealvuxh1i&amp;q=https://www.theguardian.com/profile/davidsmith&amp;sa=U&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiN7Z7L5oHpAhU_mnIEHcTVBrMQFjAAegQIAhAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw3R7vkIpEKfJFldAC-e6ega\">David Smith</a> has a short wrap on the updated disinfectant debate that just took place in the Oval Office: </em></p> \n  <p>As a clean-up attempt, it could have gone better. <strong>Donald Trump</strong> tried on Friday to justify dangerous comments about using disinfectant as a potential cure for coronavirus, falsely claiming that he was \u201casking a question sarcastically to reporters\u201d.</p> \n  <p>The US president provoked uproar at a White House coronavirus task force briefing the previous evening by suggesting that doctors study the idea of people receiving injections of disinfectant to combat the virus. Medical experts, politicians and even disinfectant makers denounced the suggestion and warned the public against consuming the product.</p> \n  <p>On Friday, even as the US death toll topped 50,000, Trump tried to make what critics saw as a desperate and dishonest u-turn. </p> \n  <p>\u201cI was asking a question sarcastically to reporters like you just to see what would happen,\u201d the president, sitting at the Resolute desk in the Oval Office, told reporters as he signed emergency funding legislation.\u201d</p> \n  <p>\u201cWhen I was asking a sarcastic \u2013 a very sarcastic question \u2013 to the reporters in the room about disinfectant on the inside, but it does kill it, and it would kill it on the hands and that would make things much better. That was done in the form of a sarcastic question to a reporter.\u201d</p> \n  <p>A video of the briefings demonstrates otherwise. </p> \n  <p>When Trump posed the question about the efficacy of disinfectant injections, he had turned to his right and was looking in the direction of <strong>Bill Bryan</strong>, the acting homeland security undersecretary for science and technology, and <strong>Deborah Birx</strong>, the coronavirus task force coordinator.</p> \n  <p><strong>Reuters</strong> reporter <strong>Jeff Mason</strong> asked if Trump wanted to clarify that he was being sarcastic and ensure no one misunderstood him. </p> \n  <p>He replied: \u201cYes. I do think that disinfectant on the hands could have a very good effect. Now, Bill is going back to check that in the laboratory. You know, it\u2019s an amazing laboratory, by the way. It\u2019s amazing the work they do.\u201d</p> \n  <p>But returning to the effect of sunlight, he added: \u201cI\u2019d like them now to look as it pertains to the human body. Not just sitting on a railing or sitting on a wall. I\u2019d like to look as it pertains because maybe there\u2019s something there. They have to work with \u2014 I\u2019m not a doctor. They have to work with their doctors. But maybe there is something to light, and the human body, and helping people that are dying.\u201d</p> \n  <p>One more time, Mason gamely pressed: \u201cJust to clarify, you\u2019re not encouraging Americans to inject disinfectant?\u201d</p> \n  <p>Trump: \u201cNo. Of course not. Interior-wise, it was said sarcastically. It was put in the form of a question to a group of extraordinarily hostile people, namely the fake news media.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Mason answered: \u201cSome doctors felt you needed to clarify that after your comments.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Trump said: \u201cOf course, all they had to do was see just \u2014 you know the way it was asked. I was looking at you.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Mason shot back: \u201cNo, you weren\u2019t, sir. I wasn\u2019t there yesterday.\u201d</p> \n  <p><strong>Weijia Jiang</strong> of <strong>CBS News </strong>pointed out that Trump had been looking at Birx. Changing his story, Trump claimed: \u201cI was looking at Bill. I was looking at the doctor. I was looking at some of the reporters. I don\u2019t know if you were there. Were you there? </p> \n  <p>Jiang said: \u201cI was there and I watched you ask her.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Trump, who has clashed with Jiang in the briefing room, added: \u201cYou were there. You were there. You I never forget.\u201d</p> \n  <p>The jumbled, inaccurate assertions are likely to have the opposite of the desired effect, only deepening concerns about Trump\u2019s embrace of flawed science that could endanger public health.</p> \n  <p><strong>Scott Gottlieb</strong>, Trump\u2019s former <strong>Food and Drug Administration</strong> director, told <strong>CNBC</strong>: </p> \n  <p>\u201cI think we need to speak very clearly. There\u2019s no circumstance under which you should take a disinfectant or inject a disinfectant for the treatment of anything, and certainly not the treatment of coronavirus.\u201d</p> \n  <p>\u201cThere\u2019s absolutely no circumstance in which that\u2019s appropriate, and it can cause death and very adverse outcomes, so people should not be doing that if that was an impression that was left by any of the reporting around comments that have been made in the last 24 hours.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ea33b128f08e05690dc4319\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-24T19:19:03.758Z\">8.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Navy leader recommends reinstating fired captain</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Officials with the US Navy recommended the reinstatement of the commander of the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt.</p> \n  <p>Roosevelt was fired after he pleaded for help with a coronavirus outbreak onboard.

Now disinfectant or doing this maybe on the hands would work. I was asking the question of the gentleman who was there yesterday, Bill [Bill Bryan, the acting homeland security undersecretary for science and technology], because when they say that something will last three to four hours or six hours, but if sun is out, or if they use disinfectant, it goes away in less than a minute. Did you hear about this yesterday?</p> \n  <p> POTUS: When I was asking a sarcastic \u2014 a very sarcastic question to the reporters in the room about disinfectant on the inside, but it does kill it, and it would kill it on the hands and that would make things much better. That was done in the form of a sarcastic question to a reporter.</p> \n  <p> Reporter: But you were asking your medical experts to look into it.</p> \n  <p> POTUS: To look into whether or not sun \u2014 and disinfectant on the hands \u2014 but whether or not sun can help us. Because, I mean he came in yesterday and he said they\u2019ve done a big study. This is a study. This isn\u2019t where he hasn\u2019t done it. This is where they\u2019ve come in with a final report that sun has a massive impact negatively on this virus. In other words, it does not live well with humidity and it doesn\u2019t live well with sun, sunlight, heat. It doesn\u2019t live well with heat and sun and and disinfectant. And that\u2019s what I brought up, and I thought that was clear.</p> \n  <p> Jeff Mason [Reuters journalist]: Just to follow up on the comments from yesterday you said you were being sarcastic, but some people may have misunderstood you. Do you want to just clarify?</p> \n  <p>POTUS: I wish they [\u2026]</p> \n  <p>Jeff Mason: Do you want to clarify to Americans if you don\u2019t want people to think that?</p> \n  <p>POTUS. Yes. I do think that disinfectant on the hands could have a very good effect. Now, Bill is going back to check that in the laboratory. You know, it\u2019s an amazing laboratory, by the way. It\u2019s amazing the work they do. So, he\u2019s going to check because a hard surface. This is a hard surface I guess maybe depending on whose hand you\u2019re talking about, right? But this is a hard surface and disinfectant, disinfectant has an unbelievable \u2014 it wipes it out. You saw it? Sun and heat, and humidity and you wipe it out. And this is from tests \u2014 they\u2019ve been doing these tests for a number of months. And the result \u2014 so then I said, \u2018Well, how do we do it inside the body or even outside the body with the hands and disinfectant I think would work.\u2019 He thinks it would work. When you use it when you\u2019re doing your hands. I guess that\u2019s one of the reasons they say wash your hands, but whether it\u2019s washing hands or disinfectant on your hands, it\u2019s very good. So, they\u2019re going to start looking at that. And there is a way of, you know, if light \u2014 if sun, sun itself that sun has a tremendous impact on or kills it like in one \u2014 it goes from what was it? Hours to like one minute instead.</p> \n  <p>So, I said you got to go back and look, but I\u2019d like them now to look as it pertains to the human body. Not just sitting on a railing or sitting on a wall. I\u2019d like to look as it pertains because maybe there\u2019s something there. They have to work with \u2014 I\u2019m not a doctor. They have to work with their doctors. but maybe there is something to light, and the human body, and helping people that are dying.</p> \n  <p>Jeff Mason: Just to clarify: You\u2019re not encouraging Americans to inject disinfectant?</p> \n  <p> POTUS: No. Of course not\u2026It was said sarcastically. It was put in the form of a question to a group of extraordinary hostile people. Namely, the fake news media.</p> \n  <p>Jeff Mason: Some doctors felt you needed to clarify that after your comments.</p> \n  <p>POTUS: Of course, all they had to do was see just \u2014 you know the way it was asked. I was looking at you.</p> \n  <p> Jeff Mason: No you weren\u2019t sir. I wasn\u2019t there yesterday.</p> \n  <p> Weijia Jiang: You were looking at Dr. Birx.</p> \n  <p> POTUS: What\u2019s that?</p> \n  <p> Weijia Jiang: You were looking at Dr. Birx.</p> \n  <p> POTUS: I was looking at Bill. I was looking at the doctor. I was looking at some of the reporters. I don\u2019t know if you were there. Were you there?</p> \n  <p>Weijia Jiang: I was there and I watched you ask her.</p> \n  <p>POTUS: You were there. You were there. You I never forget.</p> \n  <p>Jeff Mason: I wasn\u2019t there yesterday.</p> \n  <p>POTUS: You were not?</p> \n  <p>Jeff Mason: No sir.</p> \n  <p>POTUS: Yeah.
