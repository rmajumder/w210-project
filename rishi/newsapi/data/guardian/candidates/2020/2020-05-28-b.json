There are now 125,000 cases and 3,700 deaths.</p> \n  <p>Some observers have raised the possibility that the slow spread of the disease in Africa is due to the relative youth of populations. Moeti said data suggested that, as elsewhere, age and pre-existing conditions appeared important in determining the severity of each case, but countries everywhere on the continent faced significant difficulties accessing test materials and personal protective equipment for health workers.<br></p> \n  <p>A traditional remedy endorsed and distributed by the government of Madagascar will be tested thoroughly, she said. The WHO has previously <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2243669-no-evidence-madagascar-cure-for-covid-19-works-says-who/\">said there is no scientific evidence</a> that the herbal treatment is in any way effective.</p> \n  <p>Governments in Africa moved quickly to impose lockdowns and restrictions which helped slow the spread of the virus, but caused very significant problems to hundreds of millions of people living in poverty.<br></p> \n  <p>These are now being progressively removed, with South Africa, which imposed one of the strictest lockdowns, moving to level three on a scale of five this Monday. There has been controversy in the country - sub-Saharan Africa\u2019s most-developed - over a decision to allow religious services to go ahead if worshippers are restricted to less than 50 and strict social distancing precautions are observed. A ban on alcohol sale and transport will also be lifted.</p> \n  <p>Zweli Mkhize, South Africa\u2019s health minister, told reporters that no lockdown could last for ever and that it was time to provide some social and economic relief. It was hoped that religious leaders could educate congregations about the virus and how to keep safe, Mkhize said, adding that it had become clear that the country would be dealing with the pandemic for one to two years so \u201cthere has to be a degree of easing\u201d.</p> \n  <p>The emerging hotspot for the disease in South Africa - and in Africa overall - has been the Western Cape province, which includes Cape Town, the international tourist destination.<br></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ecfe9978f084e882655a8d0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-28T16:42:18.110Z\">5.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>GSK, the British pharmaceutical company, said on Thursday that its previous flu pandemic <strong>vaccine</strong> was not linked to a rise in cases of the sleep disorder narcolepsy.</p> \n  <p>The claim comes as the company said it planned to produce large volumes of an ingredient used in that vaccine for possible use in Covid-19 vaccines currently being developed.</p> \n  <p>According to <strong>Reuters</strong>, a spokesman for GSK said the \u201cscience has moved on\u201d since concerns were raised about links between narcolepsy and its H1N1 vaccine, called Pandemrix, which was developed during the flu pandemic 10 years ago. He said evidence now suggests the link is to the H1N1 flu virus itself, not the vaccine.</p> \n  <p>Previous studies in several countries, including Britain, Finland, Sweden and Ireland, had suggested Pandemrix was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/feb/09/ministers-lose-fight-to-stop-payouts-in-swine-flu-jab-narcolepsy-cases\">linked to a significant rise in cases of narcolepsy in children</a>.</p> \n  <p>Pandemrix\u2019s ingredients included a booster, or adjuvant, known as AS03, that could potentially be an ingredient in at least seven experimental COVID-19 vaccines, including one being developed by Sanofi, with whom GSK signed a collaboration deal in April.</p> \n  <p>Wendy Barclay, a professor and chair in flu virology at Imperial College London, said that since the link between narcolepsy and the 2009/10 flu pandemic is thought to have been due to cross-reactivity between parts of the H1N1 virus and human proteins that control sleep patterns, the Pandemrix vaccine\u2019s adjuvant may have played a role.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIf the virus/host cross-reactivity is the mechanism or explanation, then using an adjuvant in the vaccine to boost the immune response may have increased the chances that this cross-reactivity was generated,\u201d she told Reuters. \u201cWe still don\u2019t really know if this was the case or not.\u201d</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ecfd9108f087e3ca0f652e6\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-28T16:27:14.177Z\">5.27pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Israel</strong> has launched a campaign to test 100,000 people for coronavirus antibodies, in preparation for a potential \u201csecond wave\u201d of cases, a top official said on Thursday, according to <strong>AFP</strong>.</p> \n  <p>The initiative is one of the world\u2019s largest such schemes and aims to test Israel\u2019s \u201ccollective immunity\u201d against the COVID-19 disease by determining how widely the virus has spread and who is most at risk going forward.</p> \n  <p>In parallel to the national campaign, authorities are also running separate surveys of \u201chigh-risk areas\u201d.

Even hairdressers have reopened (what did we learn during lockdown? How many Danes are natural blondes).</p> \n   <p>There are no face masks in sight, few gloved hands, and little sign of any seismic global interruption. The only visible difference between the throng pre-lockdown and now is that pedestrians walk in \u201clanes\u201d, depending on their direction of traffic, and mobile hand sanitiser stations are parked at intervals along the high streets. Sanitiser pumps grace every shop doorway and smaller retailers display signs instructing customers how many are allowed in at any given time.

The US has recorded more deaths from the disease than any other country in the pandemic, and almost three times as many as the second-ranking country, Britain, which has recorded more than 37,000 Covid-19 deaths. The latest count of fatalities is 100,442. Earlier this month, president Donald Trump said 100,000 deaths would be \u201chorrible\u201d, but he claimed that actions by his administration had prevented a much higher toll.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>Military virus aid could look different if 2nd wave hits, says US defence secretary.</strong> US Defence Secretary Mark Esper said that as the US military prepares for another potential wave of the coronavirus, it may do things a bit differently, providing more targeted aid for cities and states and possibly shorter quarantine times for troops, AP reports.</li> \n   <li><strong>South Korea faces return to coronavirus restrictions after spike in new cases. </strong>South Korea has reported its biggest daily increase in coronavirus cases in 53 days, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/south-korea-faces-return-to-coronavirus-restrictions-after-spike-in-new-cases\">triggering warnings it may have to revert to stricter social distancing measures</a> after appearing to have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/10/south-korea-first-steps-post-covid-world\">brought the outbreak under control</a>.The Korean Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported 79 new infections on Thursday with 67 of them from the Seoul metropolitan area, home to about half of the country\u2019s population of 51 million.</li> \n   <li><strong>UN: Virus could push 14 million into hunger in Latin America. </strong>The UN World Food Program is warning that upward of at least 14 million people could go hungry in Latin America as the coronavirus pandemic rages on, shuttering people in their homes, drying up work and crippling the economy, AP reports. </li> \n   <li><strong> </strong><strong>Coronavirus knocks a third of European Foreign Direct Investment \u2013 survey. </strong>Over a third of European foreign direct investment projects announced in 2019 have been either delayed or cancelled outright because of the coronavirus pandemic, an annual survey by professional services group EY found.

The US has recorded more deaths from the disease than any other country in the pandemic, and almost three times as many as the second-ranking country, Britain, which has recorded more than 37,000 Covid-19 deaths. The latest count of fatalities is 100,047.

The former chancellor Sajid Javid also said the journey was not \u201cnecessary or justified\u201d as the number of backbenchers calling for Cummings to resign or be sacked grew to 44, with more than 60 Tory MPs weighing in to criticise him.Two of those condemning Cummings are government whips.</li> \n   <li><strong>Argentina \u2018cordons off slums\u2019 after surge in cases.</strong> Security forces in Buenos Aires <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/27/argentina-cordons-off-coronavirus-slum-ghettoes-for-poor-people\">cordoned off one of the city\u2019s largest and poorest slums</a>, stopping inhabitants from entering or leaving Villa Azul, on the outskirts of the Argentinian capital, after a surge of Covid-19 cases.Police officers erected barriers on Monday after widespread testing was launched in Villa Azul.

Since its platform was hijacked by foreign <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/14/russia-us-politics-social-media-facebook\">propaganda campaigns</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/cambridge-analytica-files\">harvested</a> for private data by malicious actors during the 2016 election season, the company has stepped up government lobbying campaigns in Washington, Britain and worldwide.</p> <p>To assist the effort, Zuckerberg hired and promoted Joel Kaplan, a Republican operative in Washington, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/nickclegg\">Nick Clegg</a>, Britain\u2019s former deputy prime minister, the New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/16/technology/zuckerberg-facebook-coronavirus.html\">reported</a>.</p> <p>Trump, who is facing an uphill <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2020\">re-election</a> bid, has not criticized Facebook for months. Trump\u2019s campaign manager, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/30/brad-parscale-trump-social-media-rasputin-campaign-manager\">Brad Parscale</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/08/trump-digital-director-brad-parscale-facebook-advertising\">credited</a> a targeted advertising campaign on Facebook as a crucial tool in Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2016\">2016 win</a>. The 2020 Trump campaign is reprising the effort.</p> <p>But the Trump campaign was not the only entity using Facebook to help Trump win in 2016. In March 2018, a whistleblower <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/17/cambridge-analytica-facebook-influence-us-election\">revealed to the Observer</a> that Cambridge Analytica, a data analytics firm that worked with Trump\u2019s election team and the winning Brexit campaign, harvested millions of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/facebook\">Facebook</a>&nbsp;profiles of US voters for use in targeting political ads.</p> <p>The company later acknowledged that&nbsp;hackers had <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/04/04/facebook-said-the-personal-data-of-most-its-2-billion-users-has-been-collected-and-shared-with-outsiders/?utm_term=.18af517384b6&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_14\">scraped</a> information from profiles of more than 2 billion users worldwide.</p> <p>Those developments saw a contrite Zuckerberg <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/11/mark-zuckerbergs-testimony-to-congress-the-key-moments\">summoned</a> before Congress in the spring of 2018, where he apologized for allowing imposter accounts with foreign backers to target American voters with advertising meant to polarize political opinion.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s clear now that we didn\u2019t do enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm,\u201d Zuckerberg <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/apr/11/mark-zuckerbergs-testimony-to-congress-the-key-moments\">said</a> then. \u201cThat goes for fake news, foreign interference in elections, and hate speech, as well as developers and data privacy.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think there are a number of areas of content we need to do a better job of policing on our service,\u201d Zuckerberg added.</p>",

  "<p>The Pulitzer-winning cartoonist Nick Anderson has described Donald Trump as an \u201cadolescent wannabe authoritarian\u201d, after the US president\u2019s re-election campaign failed to pull one of Anderson\u2019s cartoons mocking Trump\u2019s inaccurate suggestion that injecting disinfectant could protect against Covid-19.</p> <p>Anderson put <a href=\"https://www.redbubble.com/people/andertoon2/works/48156343-the-trump-cult\">his cartoon The Trump Cult up for sale on the online retailer Redbubble</a> this month.

  "<p>Donald Trump\u2019s apparent plans to punish Twitter for appending a factcheck to his claims that mail-in ballots would be \u201csubstantially fraudulent\u201d could reshape the web&nbsp;\u2013 but not necessarily in the ways he or his supporters intend.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/trump-draft-order-could-expose-twitter-and-facebook-to-more-lawsuits\">Trump\u2019s expected avenue of attack</a>&nbsp;focuses on section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. That law underpins much of how the internet is regulated in the United States, by effectively creating the hybrid publisher/platform model that has become the norm for social media companies worldwide.</p> <p>Before the CDA, passed in 1996, American communications firms had two options under the law: they could either act as \u201cmere conduits\u201d, passing on all content without alteration \u2013&nbsp;akin to a phone service&nbsp;\u2013 or they could intervene, moderating their platforms but taking legal liability for anything they let pass.</p> <p>Section 230 changed that, by creating a legal exception that allows platforms to moderate their sites as they see fit, without taking on the risk of being sued for the content they leave up. It holds that: \u201cNo provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.\u201d The clause has been described by the lawyer Jeff Kosseff as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Twenty-Six-Words-That-Created-Internet/dp/1501714414\">The Twenty-Six Words That Created the Internet</a>\u201d.</p> <p>The law has been widely misunderstood in the years since it passed,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aei.org/technology-and-innovation/social-media-companies-dont-have-to-be-politically-neutral-if-they-want-to-moderate-content/\">noted</a><a href=\"https://www.aei.org/technology-and-innovation/social-media-companies-dont-have-to-be-politically-neutral-if-they-want-to-moderate-content/\"> the neoconservative think</a><a href=\"https://www.aei.org/technology-and-innovation/social-media-companies-dont-have-to-be-politically-neutral-if-they-want-to-moderate-content/\">tank AEI</a>, with one \u201cunfortunately persistent misunderstanding\u201d being that it requires platforms to exercise political neutrality. As a result, it has come under increasing attack, particularly from the US right, which believes it is the victim of undue censorship from major web platforms.&nbsp;</p> <p>According to a draft executive order <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/trump-draft-order-could-expose-twitter-and-facebook-to-more-lawsuits\">seen by Reuters</a>, Trump plans to hit back at Twitter by weakening section 230. The order would require the Federal Communications Commission to \u201cclarify\u201d the law in a number of ways, proposing that \u201cediting content\u201d could lead to a platform forfeiting its protections under section 230, as well as looking at whether it uses \u201cdeceptive policies\u201d to moderate, or if those policies are \u201cinconsistent with its terms of service\u201d.</p> <p>If the FCC followed suit and implemented the suggestions into regulation, the primary goal appears to be to force the companies to dial back their actions, for fear of losing the protection. A ban on \u201cediting\u201d content, for instance, would seem to be targeted at warnings like those Twitter appended to Trump\u2019s mail-in ballots tweets, while the ban on \u201cdeceptive policies\u201d has been interpreted as an attempt to formally introduce a requirement for political neutrality into the section 230 constraints.</p> <p>But the regulation could backfire, at least in terms of creating the internet Trump desires. By barring social media companies from using the nuanced forms of moderation they currently employ, the executive order could force them to resort to heavy-handed actions: deleting posts, or blocking users, rather than simply factchecking or reducing the reach of the worst material.</p> <p>Similarly, removing section 230 protections entirely from a technology firm would be unlikely to force it to act as a politically neutral \u201cmere conduit\u201d, since any moderation at all \u2013 even simply deleting the vast quantities of automated spam that hit platforms such as Facebook and Twitter each day \u2013 would then open them up to lawsuits about the content they had left up.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.aei.org/economics/jeff-kosseff-on-the-twenty-six-words-that-created-the-internet-a-long-read-qa/#more-1022469\">As Kosseff said in 2019</a>: \u201cAre they saying you don\u2019t do any moderation at all? A free for all? I seriously would not want to be on the internet at all if that was the case.\u201d</p>",

It willingly ravages the lungs of any American, regardless of their skin color or visa status.</p> <p>But as America passes the 100,000 death mark, it has become abundantly clear that the pandemic amounts to a racial disaster of stunning proportions. Figures compiled by <a href=\"https://www.apmresearchlab.org/covid/deaths-by-race\">APM Research Lab</a> from 40 states show that African Americans are being killed at almost three times the rate of white people.</p> <p>Black Kansans are <a href=\"https://www.apmresearchlab.org/covid/deaths-by-race\">seven times</a> more likely to die from the virus than white Kansans.

That\u2019s the view of the Rev William Barber, co-chair of the Poor People\u2019s Campaign.</p> <p>\u201cPeople are being forced to work, putting profit over protection,\u201d he said. \u201cThis pandemic will highlight how poverty \u2013 and our willingness to let people remain in it \u2013 presents a clear and present danger for all of us.\u201d</p> <p>Barber, a leading voice on the scourge of income inequality which saw <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2017/dec/15/america-extreme-poverty-un-special-rapporteur\">41 million people</a> officially living in poverty even before the virus made landfall in the US, also pointed out that coronavirus is a disease that benefits the rich. \u201cBillionaires have made nearly $500m while essential workers have not even been given guaranteed health care, a living wage or a water supply that is protected from being shut off,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"cf8db1d9303b67e368b5b15037248ec8134c84ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cf8db1d9303b67e368b5b15037248ec8134c84ad/0_0_5264_3509/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Free food is distributed at the Spring Creek Towers in the East New York neighborhood.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Free food is distributed at the Spring Creek Towers in the East New York neighborhood.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Spencer Platt/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As with race, the fault line of inequality is glaringly obvious in New York City, where more than <a href=\"https://projects.thecity.nyc/2020_03_covid-19-tracker/\">21,000</a> of the 100,000 have died. Many low-income New Yorkers in the outer boroughs are obliged to risk their lives by turning up for work every day, branded as \u201cessential workers\u201d, while Manhattan\u2019s wealthy neighborhoods have become virtual ghost towns after their residents fled to vacation homes.</p> <p>It will take time for the full extent of mortality among low-income Americans to be known, but anecdotally it is clear the <a href=\"https://publicintegrity.org/health/coronavirus-and-inequality/pre-existing-inequality-could-make-coronavirus-hit-some-harder/\">poorest counties</a> have been hit hardest. That\u2019s evident in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/12/coronavirus-us-deep-south-poverty-race-perfect-storm\">southern states</a> such as Louisiana and Alabama where low-income people have been dying in high proportions through a combination of lack of health insurance, hospital closures and policies pursued by southern governors that have exposed vulnerable citizens to danger.</p> <p>There is nothing new in any of this for the beleaguered souls now feeling the full force of the virus\u2019s wrath.

On 27 February, the day the country first mourned a death from Covid-19, he predicted the virus \u201cwill disappear\u201d like a \u201cmiracle\u201d.</p> <p>He has gone on to spread unfounded claims that coronavirus started in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/30/donald-trump-coronavirus-chinese-lab-claim\">Chinese lab</a>. He also promoted untested and potentially life-threatening treatments, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/trump-coronavirus-treatment-disinfectant\">disinfectant</a> and the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, which he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/19/trump-hydroxychloroquine-covid-19-white-house\">revealed</a> he is taking himself \u2013 against the advice of his own administration.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s embrace of untruths has emboldened peddlers in misinformation, including sellers of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/24/revealed-leader-group-peddling-bleach-cure-lobbied-trump-coronavirus\">bleach</a> as a miracle cure.

Over the last six weeks there has been an explosion of conspiracy theories on social media, epitomized by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/14/coronavirus-viral-video-plandemic-judy-mikovits-conspiracy-theories\">Plandemic</a> documentary, which claimed a cabal led by Bill Gates were exploiting the virus to seize power.</p> <p>Wardle has been surprised how quickly conspiracy theories have erupted into the mainstream. \u201cYou have high school friends and mums and aunts who would never normally share this material now on it.\u201d</p> <p>Wardle sees the vast proliferation of misinformation as a result of deep uncertainty about the pandemic, combined with a paucity of quality information following the collapse of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/apr/09/coronavirus-us-newspapers-impact\">US news industry</a>, which has itself been accelerated by the virus\u2019 economic impact.</p> <p>Bad information cost lives. It can encourage states to reopen their economies precipitously and lure individuals to drop their guard and expose themselves to the virus.</p> <p>Wardle said: \u201cHistorians are going to look back on all of this and have a much clearer idea of how misinformation led to real-world harm \u2013 and death.\u201d</p>",

<p>South Australia has called a halt to granting international travel exemptions on compassionate grounds after SA Health bungled the case of a British woman who arrived on the weekend and tested positive to Covid-19.</p> \n  <p>Premier <strong> Steven Marshall </strong>says he wants to get to the bottom of the problem, which resulted in the woman presenting herself to authorities on arrival in Adelaide rather than being met by health officials, before allowing any further international travellers into SA in such circumstances.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think we should be granting any further exemptions for overseas travel to South Australia until we\u2019ve ironed out this administrative error,\u201d Mr Marshall said on Thursday.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe\u2019re going to make sure we have airtight systems going forward before we grant further exemptions for people coming from overseas.\u201d</p> \n  <p>But Marshall said he did not intend to \u201chang SA Health out to dry\u201d and praised the department\u2019s overall handling of the pandemic as well as the previous arrival of international travellers.</p> \n  <p>The premier also confirmed police commissioner Grant Stevens would meet the SA Health chief executive to develop new arrangements for future transfers.<br></p> \n  <p>Before Sunday\u2019s case, 21 other people had come to SA from overseas on compassionate grounds, about half to attend a funeral and the others to visit a dying relative.</p> \n  <p>The British woman, in her 50s, was granted her exemption to visit a dying relative.<br></p> \n  <p>She had spent about a week in quarantine in Victoria after arriving in Australia from the UK and had tested negative while in isolation.</p> \n  <p>She wore a mask while travelling to SA and made herself known to airport authorities and was then escorted out by police.</p> \n  <p>When tested again, she returned the positive result, becoming the state\u2019s 440th case of Covid-19 and the first for almost three weeks.</p> \n  <p>The woman was returned to quarantine while almost 20 close contacts were also ordered into self-isolation.</p> \n  <p>After initially saying Victorian officials did not tell them when the woman would arrive, chief public health Officer <strong>Nicola Spurrier </strong>issued a statement on Thursday conceding the flight information was passed on.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cDue to an administrative oversight, we can confirm the relevant flight details involving an overseas traveller arriving in South Australia were provided to SA Health prior to their arrival,\u201d Spurrier said.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWhat this issue has highlighted is the need to strengthen the processes involving travellers arriving from overseas and travelling between states during their quarantine period.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>After SA\u2019s initial comments, Victorian chief health officer <strong>Brett Sutton</strong> said South Australia was told of the woman\u2019s travel details and he had the email to prove it.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure why there is a misunderstanding about having been informed, but that email was sent and South Australian authorities were alerted about the time and flight details,\u201d Sutton said.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-28T04:14:10.397Z\">at 5.14am BST</time></p>

This rule supports our regulated businesses to uphold their AML/CTF obligations while adopting a flexible approach to customer identity processes.<br></p> \n  <p>Austrac collaborated on the rule change with the Australian Banking Association and the Australian Israel Chamber of Commerce NSW who initiated the project and identified the opening of bank accounts as a significant barrier.

This is directly related to the level of pre-pandemic income support payments.</li> \n   <li>The single rate of Newstart in January 2018 (including rent assistance and energy supplement) was $117pw below the poverty line ($185pw if they did not receive rent assistance). Youth allowance (plus these supplements) was $164pw below the poverty line ($232pw without rent assistance).</li> \n   <li>Households that have to rely mainly on social security payments (eg unemployment, parenting, and disability payments) are five times more likely to experience poverty (36%) than those receiving most income from wages and salaries (7%). However, 38% of those in poverty are in wage-earning households; the majority of whom are households with children.</li> \n   <li>In households where the main earner is a female, the poverty rate is 19% \u2013 almost double the rate when the main earner is male \u2013 10%. </li> \n   <li>In single parent families in which the main earner is a woman the rate of poverty (37%) is twice that in which the main earner is a man (18%).</li> \n   <li>The biggest differences in poverty rates between households with male and female main earners are in families with children. The average poverty rate among people in families with children where the main income-earner is female is 23%, compared with 10% where the main income-earner is male (which is the more common arrangement). In contrast, among households without children, the average poverty rate where the main income-earner is female is 12%, compared with 10% where the main income-earner is male.</li> \n   <li>Nearly half the children in sole parent families live in poverty (44%) compared with 13% for children living with both parents.</li> \n   <li>While those of working age are at greater risk of poverty than older people, over 65s who are living in private rental face a relatively high risk of poverty (41%).</li> \n   <li> Renters are almost twice as likely to live in poverty as home-owners (19% compared with 9%) with public housing tenants at greatest risk (58%).</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>You can read the <a href=\"https://bit.ly/Poverty2020pt2\">whole report here</a>. <br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-28T00:01:37.126Z\">at 1.01am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ecee3f58f0898700351d85f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-27T22:07:26.544Z\">11.07pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Australian Council of Social Services has released a report \u2013 Poverty in Australia 2020: Part 2 \u2013 Who is affected? <em>\u2013 </em>which looks at the impact of poverty before the Covid-19 crisis.</p> \n  <p>Its findings, unfortunately shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise to anyone. As the acting Acoss CEO, <strong>Jacqueline Phillips</strong>,<strong> </strong>says:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p><strong>This report exposes the disproportionate impact of poverty on households in which women are the main income earners. These households are twice as likely to live in poverty as those in which men are the main income earners (19% and 10%, respectively), with the gap even higher in households with children (at 23% and 10% respectively).</strong></p> \n   <p> Disturbingly, more than a third of single mothers and their children are living in poverty (37%). The challenges faced by single mothers that lead to so many being on low incomes have serious implications for the wellbeing of those women and their children.</p> \n   <p>Early indications suggest that women have been suffering some of the worst economic impacts of the current pandemic, and effective policy action is needed to ensure this does not translate into an ongoing reduction in female employment or an increase in poverty amongst women and children.

  "<p>Just after 7am on the morning of 23 March 2017, journalist <a href=\"https://cpj.org/data/people/miroslava-breach-velducea/\" title=\"\">Miroslava Breach Velducea</a>, a 54-year-old mother of three, was driving her 14-year-old son to school in the city of Chihuahua, Mexico, when a man walked up to her car and shot her eight times. According to reports, her son was not injured, but Breach died on the way to hospital.</p> <p>The Mexican newspaper la Jornada reported that a cardboard note was found at the scene of the murder, which read: \u201cFor being a snitch. You\u2019re next, Governor \u2013 El 80.\u201d According to Mexican police, \u201cEl 80\u201d was Carlos Arturo Quintana, son of the leader of an organised crime syndicate known as La L\u00ednea, which in its heyday controlled one of the lucrative smuggling routes for the supply and transfer of drugs from Colombia to the US. Three days before Breach was murdered, Quintana\u2019s father had been killed in a confrontation between rival gangs.</p> <p>Breach worked for la Jornada and for the regional paper Norte de Ciudad Juarez, covering politics and crime; she had also set up her own news agency, Mir. She had reported extensively on the links between organised crime and politicians in Chihuahua state. On 4 March 2016, Breach wrote in la Jornada about the alleged criminal connections of mayoral candidates in several small towns in western Chihuahua. Breach had received threats to her life on at least three occasions as a result of her reporting. In October 2016, she had told a meeting of the Federal Mechanism for Journalists and Human Rights Defenders that she had been threatened. Nevertheless, on the day she was killed, she had no protection.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fa6f80423c5348af2f2d9f685c8f7b0d7d947b5d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa6f80423c5348af2f2d9f685c8f7b0d7d947b5d/0_93_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A protest in Mexico City after the murder of Miroslava Breach in 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A protest in Mexico City after the murder of Miroslava Breach in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Cardenas/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Breach\u2019s story is not an isolated one. She was one of six journalists killed in Mexico in 2017; more than 150 journalists have been <a href=\"https://www.cndh.org.mx/sites/default/files/documentos/2019-08/COMUNICADO%20324-2019.pdf\" title=\"\">killed</a> there since 2000, 22 of them in the state of Chihuahua. In 2019, according to <a href=\"https://cpj.org/reports/2019/10/getting-away-with-murder-killed-justice.php\" title=\"\">data compiled</a> by the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), Mexico had the seventh-highest number of unsolved murders of journalists in the world, behind Somalia, Syria, Iraq, South Sudan, the Philippines and Afghanistan. On 18 May this year, gunmen killed the owner of a newspaper, Jorge Miguel Armenta \u00c1valos, and one of the policemen assigned to protect him, following earlier threats. Armenta, who is at least the third journalist to be murdered in Mexico in 2020, was attacked in broad daylight while leaving a restaurant.</p> <p>According to the World Press Freedom Index for 2020, compiled by <a href=\"https://rsf.org/en/mexico\" title=\"\">Reporters Without Borders</a> (RSF) and released in March, journalists in Mexico face a dire situation: \u201cCollusion between officials and organized crime poses a grave threat to journalists\u2019 safety and cripples the judicial system at all levels. Journalists who cover sensitive political stories or organized crime are warned, threatened and often gunned down in cold blood.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Attacks on journalists around the world take many forms, some of which are sanctioned in law. Legal or quasi-legal mechanisms include the use of civil or criminal legal actions, covert surveillance, overt censorship and financial threats (such as withdrawing state advertising), as well as more direct intimidation and threats.</p> <p>In recent years, another way of silencing journalists has proliferated: the use of what are known as strategic lawsuits against public participation, or <a href=\"https://www.pressgazette.co.uk/help-record-rise-of-slapp-lawsuits-aiming-to-silence-journalists-comment/\" title=\"\">Slapps</a>, where defamation or criminal lawsuits are brought with the intention of shutting down forms of expression such as peaceful protest or writing blogs. Originally regarded as an American legal mechanism, such lawsuits are now fairly widespread in Europe. Before she was killed in 2017, the Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia was facing around 40 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/19/malta-urged-to-drop-libel-lawsuits-against-daphne-caruana-galizia\" title=\"\">libel lawsuits</a> filed by companies, government officials and individuals, which were described by her son Matthew as a \u201cnever-ending type of torture\u201d.</p> <p>V\u011bra Jourov\u00e1, the vice-president of the European Commission, the executive branch of the EU, has been working on introducing protections against Slapp lawsuits, the defence of which can cost individuals a fortune and tie up their time and resources. Justin Borg-Barthet, a legal academic at Aberdeen University, has called for EU law to be changed to prevent \u201cforum shopping\u201d to countries with claimant-friendly laws, so that defamation suits would have to be filed in the courts of the country where the media organisation or journalist was based. Slapp lawsuits are commonly used against journalists investigating government corruption or exposing corporate abuses, but are also used against civil society organisations, activists such as environmental campaigners, trade unionists and academics, to shut down or silence acts of criticism and protest.</p> <p>In France, media organisations and NGOs <a href=\"https://actionaid.org/stories/2019/slapp-face-accountability\" title=\"\">have been hit</a> with what they view as Slapp suits for publishing accusations of land-grabbing from villagers and farmers in Cameroon by companies associated with the Bollor\u00e9 Group. In the UK, fracking companies including Ineos, UK Oil &amp; Gas, Cuadrilla, IGas and Angus Energy have since 2017 <a href=\"https://www.lag.org.uk/article/205728/fracking-and-the-right-to-protest\" title=\"\">sought and been granted</a> wide-ranging court injunctions, often directed against persons unknown, to prevent protests and campaigning activities at drilling sites. These injunctions had a chilling effect on the right to protest and free speech, until the court of appeal <a href=\"https://drillordrop.com/2019/04/03/breaking-anti-fracking-campaigners-win-appeal-against-ineos-protest-injunction/\" title=\"\">ruled in April 2019</a> that parts of an Ineos injunction prohibiting protests on the public highway and against the Ineos supply chain, and which had been used as a template for similar orders granted to other oil and gas companies, were unlawful.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4079b38e070089a37d3e8539102f970c5c9e899e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4079b38e070089a37d3e8539102f970c5c9e899e/0_232_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Maltese investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, who was murdered by a car bomb in 2017.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maltese investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, who was murdered by a car bomb in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Darrin Zammit Lupi/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Alongside Slapp suits, there are more traditional ways to keep journalists quiet. More than 150 countries retain some sort of criminal defamation laws, many of which include the possibility of imprisonment. Blasphemy and insult laws remain commonplace in many countries, and are often used by politicians and government officials against any critical media. A number of countries including Turkey and Egypt have expansive definitions of \u201cterrorism\u201d that allow them to arrest and detain anyone who voices political dissent or opposition, including journalists.</p> <p>In countries such as Hungary and Poland, governments and political allies exercise quasi-legal control of public information. Media owners can be pressured on what content to publish by threats to limit access to finance and advertising revenues.</p> <p>Separately, the lack of legal protections for journalists against those who attack them acts as a strong deterrent. Impunity fuels a vicious cycle of violence, bolstering those who aim to silence public debate and block sensitive information.</p> <p>In 2013, the UN published a <a href=\"https://en.unesco.org/un-plan-action-safety-journalists\" title=\"\">plan of action</a> on the safety of journalists, and the problem of impunity for perpetrators. The plan provides a framework for co-operation between UN bodies, national authorities, media actors and NGOs. Spearheaded through Unesco, the plan was incorporated into the Declaration of the Council of Europe in April 2014, and in guidelines published by the EU soon after. In April 2016, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe adopted a recommendation on the protection of journalism and safety of journalists and other media actors.</p> <p>By the end of 2018, the Council of Europe\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.coe.int/en/web/media-freedom/the-platform\" title=\"\">Platform for the Protection of Journalism and Safety of Journalists</a>, set up to record information on serious concerns about media freedom and the safety of journalists in Council of Europe (CoE) member states, had registered more than 500 <a href=\"https://www.coe.int/en/web/media-freedom/all-alerts\" title=\"\">alerts</a>, with year-on-year rises of incidents in every year except 2017. Nearly half of all alerts are marked as category 1, covering the most severe and damaging violations of media freedom, such as murder, direct threats to life and physical assaults. The majority of threats came from the state, with physical attacks and detentions making up nearly half the alerts. Since 2015, only 11% of all alerts have been marked as resolved, a figure that goes down to 1.82% for alerts entered in 2018. Interviews with journalists echo these statistics. In 2017, a study that interviewed 940 journalists from all CoE member states found that a staggering 40% of them had suffered slander.</p> <p>According to a <a href=\"https://rm.coe.int/background-paper-safety-of-journalists-and-other-media-actorsfinal/168094b396\" title=\"\">May 2020 report</a> by Peter Noorlander on the implementation of the 2016 CoE recommendation, attacks against journalists remain insufficiently investigated, and a very high percentage of incidents go unpunished. \u201cJournalists have little confidence that attacks or threats against them will be investigated, and often do not report them,\u201d the report said. \u201cThis has a grave effect on them, and many no longer report attacks but instead self-censor and shy away from potentially controversial issues \u2026 [CoE] Member States have committed to creating an enabling environment for freedom of expression, yet, what journalists experience on the ground is increased violence, threats, denigration, arbitrary arrests and detention.\u201d</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Some of the most high-profile cases of attacks against the media in the last few years have involved journalists in countries where neither democracy nor the rule of law is respected. Many of the more recent attacks have been perpetrated or encouraged by heads of state.</p> <p>They include cases such as the politically sponsored harassment of Philippines journalist <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/maria-ressa\" title=\"\">Maria Ressa</a>, the editor of Rappler, a social news network. Under Ressa, the site has revealed the activities of the online \u201ctroll army\u201d that supports the presidency of Rodrigo Duterte and spreads disinformation about his opponents. Rappler has also reported critically on extrajudicial killings, human-rights violations and the rising death rates from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/18/philippines-rodrigo-duterte-war-on-drugs-catholic-church\" title=\"\">Duterte\u2019s war on drugs</a>. The law suits that would follow were presaged during Duterte\u2019s state of the union speech in July 2017, when he declared that Rappler was \u201cfully owned\u201d by the Americans, and therefore in violation of the constitution.</p> <p>In January 2018, the Philippine securities and exchange commission revoked Rappler\u2019s licence. The government then investigated Rappler for tax evasion, and a warrant for Ressa\u2019s arrest was issued in November 2018. In February 2019, Ressa and Rappler were hit with another lawsuit alleging libel relating to a story published in 2012, using a law enacted four months after the story was published.</p> <p>Other infamous cases of state-sponsored crimes against journalists include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/dec/23/jamal-khashoggi-timeline-of-key-events\" title=\"\">the brutal murder</a>, on 2 October 2018, of Saudi dissident and Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey. The CIA have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/17/cia-khashoggi-findings-highly-damaging-to-saudi-prince-mohammed-bin-salman\" title=\"\">concluded</a> that the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, ordered the journalist\u2019s assassination. On 19 July 2019, the office of the UNHCR released a report <a href=\"https://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx?NewsID=24713\" title=\"\">describing</a> Khashoggi\u2019s death as \u201cpremeditated extra judicial execution\u201d.</p> <p>In many western countries, there is a risk that intimidation and violence against the media is becoming normalised. On Czech election day in October 2017, Czech president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/14/milos-zeman-czech-leader-refugees\" title=\"\">Milo</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/sep/14/milos-zeman-czech-leader-refugees\" title=\"\">\u0161 Zeman</a> held up a mock assault rifle with an inscription that was translated as \u201cAt journalists\u201d.

But that would be a mistake. In 2007, Thames Valley police searched the home and office of Sally Murrer, a local journalist. \u201cI was just pottering around doing typical local stories and in May 2007, eight police officers swooped at my home while eight swooped simultaneously at the office,\u201d she <a href=\"https://www.pressgazette.co.uk/local-press-reporter-police-surveillance-destroyed-my-life-the-snoopers-charter-absolutely-terrifies-me/\" title=\"\">told</a> reporters from the Press Gazette. \u201cThey seized all my computer equipment, searched my house, phones, laptops. They took me into custody where I stayed for a couple of days, strip-searched me. I honestly had no idea [why]. They said the charge was aiding and abetting misconduct in a public office and it carried life imprisonment.</p> <p>\u201cIt was only later when they interviewed me, which they did copious times, and played me tapes and showed me transcripts of texts, that I realised I had been under surveillance for the previous eight weeks. It was just a ghastly feeling.\u201d</p> <p>Thames Valley police had secretly recorded a conversation that took place between her and a police officer. Murrer was accused of receiving sensitive stories from the police officer and selling them to the News of the World. \u201cThe stories were about a local GBH committed by a footballer, and the murder of a local man where there was a link to cannabis and his wife was the secretary of the then-MP.\u201d After 19 months, during which she had been on police bail, Murrer\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/nov/28/pressandpublishing-medialaw\" title=\"\">trial collapsed</a> after the judge ruled police had breached her rights.</p> <p>More recently, in August 2018, the police in Northern Ireland arrested two journalists, Trevor Birney and Barry McCaffrey, over the alleged theft of documents from the Northern Ireland police ombudsman into the 1994 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2019/mar/22/investigating-the-loughinisland-murders\" title=\"\">Loughinisland massacre</a>, when members of a loyalist paramilitary group, the Ulster Volunteer Force, burst into a pub with assault rifles and fired on the customers.

The raid on the home of the News Corporation journalist was in response to a story she had written about how the Australian Signals Directorate was seeking new powers to spy on Australian citizens. In February, a court ruled the search was legitimate as the police were investigating valid national security offences. ABC\u2019s managing director, David Anderson, described the decision as \u201ca blow for public interest journalism\u201d and argued that it highlighted a \u201cserious problem\u201d with Australia\u2019s national security laws.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>Since the outbreak of coronavirus, protections for journalists have become <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-52363305\" title=\"\">more urgent than ever.</a> According to RSF\u2019s secretary-general, Christophe Deloire, \u201cThe coronavirus pandemic illustrates the negative factors threatening the right to reliable information, and is itself an exacerbating factor.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBoth China and Iran censored their major coronavirus outbreaks extensively.

The statement said that the executive group were concerned by the efforts by some states to use the crisis to put in place undue restrictions on a free and independent media: \u201cSuch actions deny societies critical information on the spread of the disease and undermine trust in responsible government\u201d. It also urged \u201cgovernments to continue guaranteeing the freedom and independence of media, the safety of journalists and other media professionals, and to refrain from imposing undue restrictions in the fight against proliferation of the coronavirus\u201d.</p> <h2>* * *</h2> <p>On the day of the murder of Miroslava Breach Velducea in 2017, Mexico\u2019s federal special prosecutor for crimes against freedom of expression stated that a federal investigation had begun.

Testifying under the alias \u201cApolo\u201d, the son of the leader of Los Salazares gave evidence about how his father was upset that a relative lost a mayoral election in the town of Chinipas, el Heraldo newspaper reported. The judge found that Moreno supervised the crime and enlisted the help of two other people, Jaciel Vega Villa, who allegedly drove the car to Breach\u2019s home, and Ram\u00f3n Andr\u00e9s Zavala Corral, who was suspected of having fired the shots that fatally wounded her.

  "<p>The United States has recorded more than 100,000 deaths from Covid-19, moving past a grim milestone even as many states relax mitigation measures to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus.</p> <p>The US has recorded more deaths from the disease than any other country in the pandemic, and almost three times as many as the second-ranking country, Britain, which has recorded more than 37,000 Covid-19 deaths.</p> <p>The latest count of fatalities is 100,047 <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">according to Johns Hopkins University data.</a></p> <p>Donald Trump did not immediately react to the news. On Twitter, he posted a clip of Fox New\u2019s Lou Dobbs calling Trump \u201carguably the greatest president in our history\u201d. Earlier this month, Trump said 100,000 deaths would be \u201chorrible\u201d, but he claimed that actions by his administration had prevented a much higher toll.</p> <p>The virus has killed more Americans than the Vietnam and Korean wars combined, and the death toll is approaching that of the first world war, when more than 116,000 Americans died in combat.</p> <p>The number of fatalities in the United States is still climbing, , and federal officials warn that the likely actual toll from the coronavirus is higher than the official figure.</p> <p>A <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/covid19/excess_deaths.htm\">tracking project by the Centers of Disease Control</a> (CDC) of \u201cexcess deaths\u201d in each state beyond seasonal averages suggests the official count of Covid-19 deaths could leave out thousands of cases.</p> <p>\u201cThese deaths could represent misclassified Covid-19 deaths, or potentially could be indirectly related to Covid-19 (eg, deaths from other causes occurring in the context of healthcare shortages or overburdened healthcare systems),\u201d the CDC said.</p> <p>The first confirmed coronavirus case in the United States emerged on 20 January, in Washington state, the same day that a first case was confirmed in South Korea. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/28/trump-coronavirus-politics-us-health-disaster\">Months ensued</a> in which the White House told states they would receive minimal federal support in obtaining testing kits, ventilators, protective equipment and other gear.</p> <p>The United States has increased its testing capacity but has yet to stand up a national plan for the contact tracing of positive cases, a step South Korea took immediately. That country has since recorded 269 deaths from coronavirus.</p> <p>In a video, former vice-president Joe Biden expressed grief for the lives lost and condemned the administration for not acting sooner. \u201cTo those hurting, I\u2019m so sorry for your loss,\u201d Biden said.</p> <p>Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic senator from Massachusetts and former presidential candidate, struck a similar tone. \u201c100,000 Americans are gone. They were our brothers and sisters. Our friends and neighbors,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd too many of them could have been saved if our federal government had just done more.\u201d</p> <p>Across Europe, the virus exacted a terrible toll. Eight of the 10 countries with the top per-capita rates of Covid-19 deaths are in Europe; the United States ranks ninth on that list, with about 30 deaths per 100,000 people, according to <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/mortality\">data from</a> Johns Hopkins University. Britain is third, with 55.64 deaths per 100,000.</p> <p>Health experts warn that the United States can expect millions more Covid-19 cases and a tragic number of deaths to come, unless the virus takes an unprecedented and unforeseen vector. With regional infection rates varying from about 5-20%, most experts believe the virus will continue to churn through the US population until the overall rate of infection is 50-60% \u2013 or until a vaccine is widely administered.</p>",

In the weeks that followed, Newsom expanded the modifications to allow counties that had not been as affected by the virus as others to apply for looser restrictions. As of Tuesday, 47 out of the state\u2019s 58 counties have self-attested, and will be allowed to reopen hair salons, offices, some schools, all with modifications. <br></p> \n  <p>\u201cThe pace at which the state has made these modifications is concerning to me,\u201d said Dr Sara Cody, health director in Santa Clara county, location of what is believed to be the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/22/coronavirus-killing-americans-weeks-earlier-than-thought\"> first Covid-related death</a> in the country. </p> \n  <p>Cody voiced these concerns at a local board of supervisors meeting on Tuesday, where she called for the county to take a more cautious approach. Since the start of the stay-at-home order, local variance has taken precedence, meaning if a county health officer called for stricter measures than the state order, then the county would comply with the county order. <br></p> \n  <p>Cody continued: \u201cWe can\u2019t see the effect of any of these changes, the effect on Covid, for at least 14 days, an incubation period, and 21 days is even better,\u201d she said. \u201cSo the state modifications are being made without a real understanding of the consequences of what the last move has been and with the possibly serious effects for health and possibly serious risks of an exponential growth in cases and therefore a risk to social and economic well-being.\u201d<br></p> \n  <p>In particular, Cody had reservations about Newsom\u2019s decision to authorize county health officers to allow religious, cultural and political gatherings of 100 people, a move she said \u201cposes a very serious risk of the spread of Covid-19, based on probability alone\u201d.<br></p> \n  <p>Cody\u2019s concerns come as California crossed the threshold on Wednesday of more than 100,000 positive cases \u2013 101,229 to be exact.

Turkey is home to 4 million mostly Syrian refugees. </p> \n  <p>Memories are still fresh of the crisis that erupted when thousands responded to Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan\u2019s abrupt decision to \u201copen the gates to Europe\u201d for refugees earlier this year. An estimated 30,000 men, women and children - many bussed in by Turkish forces - converged on the frontier with thousands then attempting to illegally cross over into Greece. In recent days bilateral tensions have been on the rise over Athens\u2019 declared intention to build a fence to bolster the border \u2013 reiterated by Chrysohoidis this afternoon. </p> \n  <p>Meanwhile, migrants forced to endure prolonged quarantine in a facility in the Peloponnese also took to the streets in protest today. </p> \n  <p>Greek authorities announced lockdown measures would be extended for another 14 days after three more coronavirus cases were confirmed in the holding centre \u2013 a hotel in the southern town of Kranidi hosting 470 migrants and refugees mostly from sub-Saharan Africa. The hotel has been under quarantine since 21 April when 153 people first tested positive for the virus. </p> \n  <p>Growing disquiet is also being expressed by aid workers over refugee camps having to put up with prolonged lockdowns when the rest of Greece is relaxing restrictions and re-assuming a semblance of normality. </p> \n  <p>\u201cWe have seen a noticeable rise in all sorts of violence, from tent violence to sexual violence because people are forced to spend much more time in camps,\u201d Apostolos Veizis, the medical director of M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res in Greece told the Guardian. \u201cThese people are not treated as human but numbers.

Thank you to all of those who got in touch with tips, comments and more. My colleague Nick Ames will be picking up the baton now. </p> \n  <p>Here are the top developments from the last few hours: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Known global deaths pass 350,000. </strong>More than 350,000 people have now lost their lives in the coronavirus pandemic worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins University tracker. The current toll stands at 350,456. The number of confirmed cases is 5,589,932, after the number of declared cases doubled in a month, with more than one million new cases registered in the last 11 days. There were 500,000 cases registered in just 48 hours, between Sunday, when cases passed 5 million, and Tuesday, when cases passed 5.5 million. True death tolls and cases are likely to be significantly higher due to differing definitions and testing rates, delays and suspected underreporting. The US alone accounts for less than a third of the global toll, with 98,916 deaths.</li> \n   <li><strong>Tory unrest increases pressure on PM to sack Dominic Cummings. </strong>There is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/26/tory-unrest-increases-pressure-pm-sack-dominic-cummings\">growing revolt within Boris Johnson\u2019s party</a> over his refusal to fire Dominic Cummings, his chief adviser, over his lockdown breach. A<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/26/junior-minister-resigns-over-dominic-cummings-lockdown-trip-douglas-ross\"> junior minister has resigned</a>, and 30 other Conservative MPs have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/26/public-anger-swells-ranks-tory-mps-turning-on-dominic-cummings\">called for Cummings to go</a>. Eight more Tory MPs were publicly critical of Cummings\u2019 actions and three said privately that he should be forced out, according to the Guardian\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/heatherstewart\">Heather Stewart</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/rowena-mason\">Rowena Mason</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/kate-proctor\">Kate Proctor</a>.</li> \n   <li><strong>The WHO says the Americas are the new epicentre of the disease. </strong>The World Health Organization\u2019s regional director Dr Carissa Etienne said outbreaks were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/27/global-report-who-says-the-americas-are-centre-of-pandemic-as-cases-surge\">accelerating in countries such as Brazil</a>, where the number of deaths reported in the last week was the highest in the world for a seven-day period since the coronavirus pandemic began. The number of coronavirus infections to accelerate in Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua, she said.</li> \n   <li><strong>New Zealand expects plan for safe travel with Australia in June. </strong>Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Wednesday that a draft blueprint on safely starting travel between New Zealand and Australia will be presented to both governments in early June, Reuters reports. The neighbours have been discussing the possibility of a travel bubble between them as both have slowed the spread of the novel coronavirus to levels well below those in United States, Britain and some other European countries. New Zealand has also reported a fifth consecutive day of no new cases of Covid-19.</li> \n   <li><strong>South Korea reports biggest daily jump in almost 50 days. </strong>South Korea South Korea has reported 40 new coronavirus cases for its biggest daily jump in nearly 50 days, causing alarm in a country where millions of children are returning to school. All but four of the new cases came from the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area, where officials have been scrambling to stem transmissions linked to nightclubs, karaoke rooms and an e-commerce warehouse. Three cases were linked to international arrivals. South Korea has also jailed a man for four months for breaking quarantine rules, in the country\u2019s first such prison sentence.</li> \n   <li><strong>Vietnam to readmit foreigners. </strong>Vietnam will resume issuing e-visas to citizens from 80 countries from 1 July, the government said, though it was unclear whether quarantine measures would be lifted. The country imposed a blanket ban on foreigners entering the country in March as part of its aggressive response to the pandemic, which has also involved mass quarantines and expansive contact tracing.So far, Vietnam has not reported any coronavirus deaths.</li> \n   <li><strong>Macron unveils \u20ac8bn French auto rescue, champions electric cars. </strong>President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday announced an \u20ac8bn (US$8.8bn) plan to revive France\u2019s auto industry by making it the European leader in electric cars, boosting a sector brought to its knees by the coronavirus. Macron said the package would include one billion euros in subsidies to encourage purchases of electric and hybrid cars and set a target of France producing a million green cars annually by 2025.The \u201chistoric\u201d intervention will aim to turn France\u2019s rechargeable car industry into Europe\u2019s biggest, the president said.</li> \n   <li><strong>Germany extends distancing rules to end of June. </strong>Germany has extended social distancing rules aimed at containing the spread of the coronavirus epidemic to 29 June, Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s government said on Tuesday. Merkel\u2019s government had been embroiled in disagreements with the least-affected states, some of which wanted to ditch the measures and open up entirely. Germany\u2019s virus caseload now tops 181,200 with just over 8,372 deaths - much lower than European counterparts such as Britain, France, Spain and Italy.</li> \n   <li><strong>India backs hydroxychloroquine for virus prevention. </strong>India\u2019s top biomedical research body has backed the use of the anti-malarial hydroxychloroquine as a preventive against coronavirus, after the WHO suspended clinical trials of the drug over safety concerns. The endorsement from the Indian Council of Medical Research came a week after US President Donald Trump said he was taking the drug as a preventative measure. India - which accounts for 70% of global production of hydroxychloroquine - on Tuesday reported 145,380 cases of the virus including 4,167 deaths.</li> \n   <li><strong>Spain begins 10 days of mourning. </strong>Starting on Wednesday, the country will mourn for the nearly 27,000 people who have died from coronavirus in the country. Flags will be hoisted to half-staff in more than 14,000 public buildings across the country and on Spanish naval vessels until 5 June. It marks the longest official mourning period in Spain\u2019s four-decade-old democracy.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/27/coronavirus-latest-at-a-glance\">Coronavirus latest: at a glance</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ece002d8f0852d729950738\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-27T05:54:40.169Z\">6.54am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><em>Sabrina Toppa reports for the Guardian from Lahore: </em></p> \n  <p><strong>Pakistan\u2019s garment workers fight for rights amid Covid-19 crisis</strong></p> \n  <p>Police in Karachi last week allegedly shot at hundreds of unarmed garment workers protesting outside a factory supplying denim for global fashion brands.</p> \n  <p>Garment workers claimed to have been charged by police with batons outside a factory which is reported to have fired more than 15,000 workers since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, according to Nasir Mansoor from the National Trade Union Federation.

There were 500,000 cases registered in just 48 hours, between Sunday, when cases passed 5 million, and Tuesday, when cases passed 5.5 million. True death tolls and cases are likely to be significantly higher due to differing definitions and testing rates, delays and suspected underreporting.

The US alone accounts for under a third of these, with 98,852.

A <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/26/junior-minister-resigns-over-dominic-cummings-lockdown-trip-douglas-ross\">a junior minister</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/26/junior-minister-resigns-over-dominic-cummings-lockdown-trip-douglas-ross\"> has resigned</a>, and 30 other Conservative MPs have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/26/public-anger-swells-ranks-tory-mps-turning-on-dominic-cummings\">called for Cummings to go</a>. Eight more Tory MPs were publicly critical of Cummings\u2019 actions and three said privately that he should be forced out, according to the Guardian\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/heatherstewart\">Heather Stewart</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/rowena-mason\">Rowena Mason</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/kate-proctor\">Kate Proctor</a>. </li> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/26/trump-twitter-fact-check-warning-label\">Twitter added a fact-check warning to the bottom of a tweet by US President Donald Trump for the first time</a>. </strong>Trump tweeted: \u201cThere is NO WAY (ZERO!) that Mail-In Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent. Mail boxes will be robbed, ballots will be forged &amp; even illegally printed out &amp; fraudulently signed. The Governor of California is sending Ballots to millions of people, anyone.....\u201d Bellow the tweet there is now a link with the warning text \u201cGet the facts about mail-in ballots\u201d. On Sunday Trump suggested that supporters of mail-in voting were using the coronavirus outbreak to perpetrate a \u201cscam\u201d.</li> \n   <li><strong>Trump said he thought it was \u201cvery unusual\u201d that Joe Biden wore a face mask yesterday</strong> while attending a Memorial Day ceremony. The president has resisted wearing a mask in public, even though the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that Americans cover their faces while out in public and around other people.</li> \n   <li><strong> </strong><strong>The Pentagon\u2019s deputy inspector general resigned. </strong>Recently, the president effectively removed Glenn Fine<strong> </strong>from his role leading a coronavirus relief spending oversight committee, and the defence department official has now become the latest inspector general to step down in recent weeks.</li> \n   <li><strong>The trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange was reopened after two months. </strong>Cuomo rang the opening bell to cheers from traders, who will still have to wear masks and stay six feet apart from each other when they\u2019re on the floor.<strong> </strong></li> \n   <li><strong>The WHO says the Americas are the new epicentre of the disease</strong>. The World Health Organization\u2019s regional director Dr Carissa Etienne said outbreaks were accelerating in countries such as Brazil, where the number of deaths reported in the last week was the highest in the world for a seven-day period since the coronavirus pandemic began. The number of coronavirus infections to accelerate in Guatemala, El Salvador and Nicaragua, she said.</li> \n   <li><strong>The UN refugee agency said Covid-19 had pushed its humanitarian work to near \u201cbreaking point\u201d in Yemen, </strong>a country devastated by five years of war.

A separate UN agency said it had only received around 15% of the funding required for the $3.38bn (\u20ac3bn) aid package for Yemen this year.</li> \n   <li><strong>Spain has declared 10 days of mourning </strong>starting on Wednesday for the nearly 27,000 people who have died from coronavirus in the country. Flags will be hoisted to half-staff in more than 14,000 public buildings across the country and on Spanish naval vessels until 5 June. It marks the longest official mourning period in Spain\u2019s four-decade-old democracy.</li> \n   <li><strong>The UK death toll passed 47,000, </strong>according to new figures from the country\u2019s Office for National Statistics.

The UK government figure only includes deaths of patients who have tested positive for the coronavirus.</li> \n   <li><strong>Russia reports record one-day rise in deaths. </strong>Russia has announced that 174 people with coronavirus have died in the past 24 hours, a record one-day amount that has pushed the nationwide death toll to 3,807. Officials reported 8,915 new cases, pushing its overall case tally to 362,342 \u2013 but Vladimir Putin said the country has \u201cpassed the peak\u201d of the virus.</li> \n   <li><strong>Mexico City records thousands more deaths than usual, amid doubt over the official Covid-19 toll. </strong>This year, Mexico City has issued <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/mexico-city-records-thousands-more-deaths-than-usual-amid-doubt-over-official-covid-19-toll\">8,072 more death certificates than the average</a> for the same period in the past four years, according to a study that suggests the country\u2019s coronavirus death toll could be significantly higher than the official figure of nearly 7,400. The report\u2019s authors found 37% more death certificates were issued in April 2020 than that month\u2019s average during the previous four years. By the end of May they estimated the number may grow to 120%.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n</div>"
