After nearly 44 years incarcerated, he would be free from a life sentence handed to him as a juvenile.</p> <p>His sister Yolanda Peterson had prepared a room for him to stay in her Harper Woods home and planned for his parole agent to come see the place.

Staff performed CPR. Garrison was transported to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead, Gautz said. </p> <p>A postmortem test confirmed that he was positive for Covid-19.

She said men in prison have told her that her brother\u2019s cellmate was ill several days before Garrison died.</p> <p>The Department of Corrections disputed that account. Gautz said health care staff went cell-to-cell to assess prisoners in the days before Garrison died, and Garrison\u2019s bunkmate denied having symptoms of Covid-19, aside from a cough. The man later tested negative for the coronavirus when assessed again after Garrison\u2019s death, Gautz said. </p> <p>Garrison is one of 17 state prisoners who\u2019ve died of Covid-19 as of Friday. </p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e9b53548f08b7689b030fcd\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-18T19:28:59.754Z\">8.28pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Former treasury secretary to George W Bush dies</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"77367c1d52bc4dd0b73cc358b40e146a6cab90fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77367c1d52bc4dd0b73cc358b40e146a6cab90fe/0_108_1992_1195/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Then Treasury Secretary Paul O\u2019Neill, left, is joined by then Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and then New York City Fire Commissioner Thomas Von Essen, right, on the New York Stock Exchange trading floor when trading resumed for the first time since the previous week\u2019s terrorist attack.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Then Treasury Secretary Paul O\u2019Neill, left, is joined by then Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and then New York City Fire Commissioner Thomas Von Essen, right, on the New York Stock Exchange trading floor when trading resumed for the first time since the previous week\u2019s terrorist attack.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Drew/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Paul O\u2019Neill, a former Treasury secretary who broke with <strong>George W.

  "<p>Many American institutions and traditions have been challenged in the era of Donald Trump. The latest is federalism, the idea that power should be shared between the federal government and the states. The president\u2019s response to the coronavirus epidemic has had a curious impact, overturning the historical preferences of both parties. Put simply, coronavirus has meant federalism for Democrats who have been abandoned in the face of the pandemic, and slavish devotion to federal authority for Republicans.</p> <p>Federalism provides a logical way for the United States to respond to epidemics. States have the primary responsibility for their citizens\u2019 health \u2013 about which they have the best information \u2013 but the federal government needs to take the lead in coordinating a national response. Supplies need to be sent where they are needed most, and measures like lockdowns have to be implemented and lifted in accordance with a national plan rather than haphazardly at the state level \u2013 because, as Andrew Cuomo <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/trump-has-single-handedly-created-a-new-federalism\">has said</a>, \u201cstate boundaries mean very little to the virus\u201d.</p> <p>Yet a vacuum of responsible leadership from the White House has meant that the system has not worked as intended. Rather than seeing it as his role to work with the states to develop a national plan, Trump instead spent months denying that a problem even existed and stating that he took \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/13/donald-trump-coronavirus-national-emergency-sketch\">no responsibility</a>\u201d for fighting the virus. When the prospect of emerging as the hero who restarted the economy beckoned, he swung to the other extreme, claiming \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2020/apr/14/donald-trump-when-somebody-is-president-of-the-united-states-the-authority-is-total-video\">total authority</a>\u201d to supersede decisions made by the states and suggesting that governors who wanted to lift lockdowns at their own pace rather than his direction were committing \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1250075668282576898\">mutiny</a>\u201d. On Friday, Trump went on a bizarre, all-caps Twitter rampage, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/17/trump-liberate-tweets-coronavirus-stay-at-home-orders\">calling on citizens</a> to \u201cLIBERATE\u201d Minnesota, Michigan and Virginia from state quarantine measures.</p> <p>Many Republican governors have responded by following the president\u2019s lead. Even as the government\u2019s top infectious diseases expert was <a href=\"https://www.voanews.com/science-health/coronavirus-outbreak/top-us-disease-expert-backs-nationwide-lockdown\">pleading</a> for a nationwide lockdown, governors like Florida\u2019s Ron DeSantis chose to sacrifice the health of their constituents on the altar of their desire to please the president.</p> <p>When DeSantis did eventually issue a stay-at-home order, he explicitly cited Trump\u2019s changing \u201c<a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2020/04/01/politics/desantis-florida-coronavirus/index.html\">demeanor</a>\u201d as his reason for doing so. Other Republican governors took their cues from the federal government too, for instance by waiting for Trump to issue a national emergency declaration before they issued their own. Some Republican governors \u2013 such as Mike DeWine of Ohio and Larry Hogan of Maryland \u2013 acted earlier, but they represent states in which Trump\u2019s popularity is <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/democratic-governors-are-quicker-in-responding-to-the-coronavirus-than-republicans-135599\">much lower than average</a> among Republican-governed states.</p> <p>Democratic governors have been more in tune with the needs of their localities than the president\u2019s shifting moods, issuing emergency declarations and lockdown orders sooner than their Republican counterparts. When their pleas for a more effective federal response were ignored, they turned to self-help instead. As it becomes clear that Trump is pushing for an irresponsible reopening of the economy, Democratic governors in the west and north-east have established <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/democrats-governors-states-coronavirus-outbreak\">working groups</a> consisting of public health experts and economists to plot their own way forward.</p> <p>Why did Republican governors stick with the president while Democratic governors went their own way? Much of the explanation can be found in the power of partisanship, and the nationalization of state politics. Trump\u2019s grip on the Republican base is so absolute that the governors of red states value their relationship with him above almost any other. And so much of local politics is now <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/polyarchy/2018/5/31/17406590/local-national-political-institutions-polarization-federalism\">filtered through a national lens</a> that Republican governors must be seen to be toeing the president\u2019s line even on local issues in order to please that base.</p> <p>The particular way that Trump exercises power has also contributed to the reaction of governors from both parties. Trump has made clear that he will dole out federal largesse according to political loyalty, even preventing Colorado\u2019s Democratic-led government from purchasing ventilators on the open market and later sending a hundred units \u201c<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/4/10/21215578/trump-ventilators-coronavirus-cory-gardner-colorado-jared-polis-patronage\">at the request</a>\u201d of the state\u2019s Republican senator, who is facing a tough re-election battle. The message is clear: Democratic governors need to help themselves, because Trump sure won\u2019t. And Republican governors need to stick close to a president who sees himself as his party\u2019s feudal patron rather than the leader of the entire nation.</p> <p>The result has been an inversion of what the Founders intended, with some states slavishly following federal dictate in flagrant disregard of local needs, and others hung out to dry as a national crisis looms and Washington does little to shepherd a national response. Democratic governors cannot rely on the president to protect the lives of their citizens, and Republican governors find themselves acting more as the lackeys of a monarch than representatives of the interests of their states. Taken together, these developments suggest that federalism has become another casualty of a president unprecedented in his disregard for everything which truly makes America great.</p> <ul> <li><p>Andrew Gawthorpe is a historian of the United States at Leiden University in the Netherlands</p></li> </ul>",

  "<p>Death was the catalyst for Walter \u201cHawk\u201d Newsome\u2019s most contentious idea. It came to him during the first few days of July in 2016. This was the week that a Minnesota police officer shot 32-year-old Philando Castile <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jun/20/philando-castile-shooting-marijuana-car-dashcam-footage\">five times</a> and killed him in his car; an off-duty New York police officer <a href=\"https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/brooklyn/off-duty-shoots-man-dead-road-rage-incident-brooklyn-article-1.2698074\">killed</a> 37-year-old Delron Dempsey in front of his family; and two Louisiana cops fatally shot Alton Sterling <a href=\"https://www.wwltv.com/article/news/local/coroner-releases-autopsy-toxicology-reports-for-alton-sterling/289-532514020\">six times</a>.</p> <p>These extrajudicial slayings bedeviled Newsome, who spent his youth being terrorized by the NYPD in the Bronx. Despite the Democratic politicians he had canvassed and campaigned for \u2013 from Bloomberg before his \u201cstop and frisk\u201d days to Barack Obama \u2013 the situation didn\u2019t seem to get better. Blacks were still being killed by the police at a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/08/09/what-weve-learned-about-police-shootings-years-after-ferguson/\">disproportionate rate</a>.</p> <p>On that dog day of summer, Newsome decided to take a walk, beginning in Lower Manhattan near Wall Street.

When Dems talked to immigrant communities, they got Daca. But when it is black people, we get jive talk and the electric slide,\u201d said Newsome, the 42-year-old founder of <a href=\"https://www.blacklivesmattergreaterny.com/founder\">Black Lives Matter of Greater New York</a>.</p> <p>To launch his campaign, Newsome reached out to<strong> </strong>actor and rapper Nick Cannon, who had released the viral song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AQjZ8ZbnF4\">Too Broke to Vote</a>. They chose the Republican national convention to debut, because, \u201cthe white supremacists said that [Black Lives Matter] better not show up\u201d. Cannon supported Newsome and 11 of his followers with banners, T-shirts, a van and a house. They marched and held a news conference, <a href=\"https://www.pri.org/stories/2016-07-20/i-aint-voting-will-black-lives-matter-reject-right-vote\">gaining</a> some attention.</p> <p>But at the Democratic national convention the following week, there was backlash. \u201cOlder blacks thought that I was dishonoring MLK,\u201d Newsome said. \u201cBut he fought for the <em>power</em> of the vote, not for it to be a popularity contest.\u201d Newsome\u2019s own mother later told him that she thought he\u2019d \u201clost his mind\u201d, and some of his politically minded peers in the Bronx hosted small-scale counter-demonstrations.</p> <p>Newsome stuck to his convictions. He believed Hillary Clinton\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/21/hillary-clinton-black-millennial-voters\">history</a> of backing the 1994 <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/05/the-tragic-politics-of-crime/392114/\">crime bill</a>, which expanded the death penalty and lengthened prison sentences,<strong> </strong>and the time she referred to <a href=\"https://www.advocate.com/election/2016/2/25/black-queer-protester-hillary-clinton-you-owe-black-people-apology\">black </a><a href=\"https://www.advocate.com/election/2016/2/25/black-queer-protester-hillary-clinton-you-owe-black-people-apology\">young men as \u201csuperpredators\u201d</a><strong> </strong>made her symbolic of everything he protested against. On 8 November, he wrote in his own name on his presidential ballot. \u201c\u2018I only wish that <em>more</em> people would have stood with us. It might have forced Hillary to do more to draw people to the polls,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Like his I Ain\u2019t Voting initiative, Newsome is polarizing \u2013 even within the Black Lives Matter movement. He\u2019s been criticized for speaking at a <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/wjx9m4/speaking-at-a-trump-rally-made-this-blm-activist-an-outcast\">Trump rally</a>.<strong> </strong>While his videos debating conservatives like Tomi Lahren go viral, and he\u2019s a regular face on CNN and BET, he has a history with alcoholism and domestic abuse. \u201cI had to look at myself and say, \u2018You are a toxic individual and you need to change,\u2019\u201d he said. Newsome has made public apologies, is four years sober, and participates in therapy, but some have been reluctant to work with him.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2011/08/01/138891494/bertha-lewis-from-acorn-to-the-black-institute\">Bertha Lewis</a>, the 69-year-old organizer, was one of those suspicious activists.

It called for blacks to leave their presidential ballots blank in red states.</p> <p>They hoped this would force politicians to \u201cnotice that black voters are more than cattle chewing cud, to be herded to the polls\u201d. But the audacious essay was mostly ignored or criticized. Social justice activist Bill Fletcher Jr <a href=\"https://inthesetimes.com/article/19502/the-blank-vote-is-not-a-strategy-for-black-power\">called the proposed tactic</a> a \u201ccherry bomb\u201d because it created noise, \u201cwhile producing nothing but smoke\u201d.</p> <p>Looking back, the 2016 election saw the first decline in black <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/05/12/black-voter-turnout-fell-in-2016-even-as-a-record-number-of-americans-cast-ballots/\">voter turnout in 20 years</a>. In trying to explain the downturn, pundits have cited everything from increased <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/election-2016-restrictive-voting-laws-numbers#raceandvoting\">restrictions</a> such as voter ID laws to the disinformation efforts of Russian operatives, whose <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-49987657\">chief target was </a>blacks. The Russians used Facebook pages with misleading names like \u201cBlack Matters\u201d to encourage blacks not to vote \u2013 a fact <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2019-11-17/donald-trump-black-voters-election-politics\">some believe reflects the abject foolishness</a> of Newsome\u2019s efforts.</p> <p>Newsome disagrees. \u201cThe Russians saw what I saw \u2013 that the Democrats were disregarding blacks,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they were trying to discourage \u2026 I was telling people to make politicians work for your vote.\u201d</p> <p>While \u201cI Ain\u2019t Voting\u201d didn\u2019t galvanize many voters, Newsome believes that its spirit made it a success. Both parties have prioritized recapturing the more than 765,000 eligible black voters who sat out of the 2016 election \u2013 whether it\u2019s presumptive nominee Joe Biden pledging to nominate a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/2/25/21153824/biden-black-woman-supreme-court\">black woman</a> to the supreme court or Donald Trump talking about <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/crime-justice/2020/02/trump-just-bragged-about-criminal-justice-reform-look-closer-at-how-his-administration-is-undoing-it/\">criminal justice</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--showcase\"> <blockquote> <p>Newsome also sees a Trump presidency as a 'curse and a gift' that opened a lane for radical politics.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Newsome also sees a Trump presidency as a \u201ccurse <em>and</em> a gift\u201d that opened a lane for radical politics. For him, this is embodied in the rise of politicians like the New York US representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, for whom his group members were <a href=\"https://www.cityandstateny.com/articles/politics/campaigns-elections/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-beats-joe-crowley.html\">early supporters</a>. And the early success of Senator Bernie Sanders.</p> <p>While Sanders failed to get the Democratic nomination, largely thanks to his inability to rouse support from older blacks, his presence has pushed the Democratic frontrunner Joe Biden, a shepherd of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/27/us/politics/joe-biden-crime-bill-mass-incarceration.html\">racist crime bills in the 90s</a>, to a more progressive criminal justice platform that includes a $300m grant for racially representative, community-oriented policing.</p> <p>Newsome also believes that many of the black youth under 30, among whom Sanders won a <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/03/bernie-sanders-black-voters/607789/\">majority of support</a>, will be a part of the #BernieOrBust contingent, and withhold their support for Biden. He feels this is linked to I Ain\u2019t Voting. \u201cMany black youth understand voting as a futile effort, in which the politicians they put in place never follow through,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But when it comes down to this year\u2019s election, Newsome is changing course. He has decided to vote, and encourage other black people to cast their ballots as well because he believes politicians are now working harder, and because his sister Chivona is running for a local seat in the Bronx.</p> <p>There\u2019s just one caveat: \u201cI\u2019ll be encouraging blacks to vote the issues,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I stand behind the issues and the person fails me, I can still sleep at night.\u201d</p>",

Then it was the turn of the 15 members and six advisers on the emergency committee, drawn from around the world.</p> \n<p>The debate was highly technical but it had one critical issue at its heart. It was known by then that the virus had spread from person to person, but the question was how easily?</p> \n<p>If human-to-human transmission was only happening in close quarters, in families, or between patients and health workers, then perhaps it could be largely contained without a worldwide alert, and all the global economic disruption that entailed. If the virus was spreading freely among communities, there was not a moment to lose.</p> \n<p>The emergency committee was split down the middle on the question.

It was sent from Taiwan\u2019s CDC to its WHO liaison officer on 31 December, hours after the first official report of a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan were published online.</p> \n<p>According to the text provided to the Guardian, the email said: \u201cNews resources today indicate that at least seven, atypical pneumonia cases were reported in China.\u201d</p> \n<p>It restates the details of Chinese report, adding \u201cI would greatly appreciate it if you have relevant information to share with us.\u201d</p> \n<p>The email did not contain new information, and certainly nothing about human-to-human transmission. The WHO had picked up the same report on the night of 30 December and was urgently seeking more information. On 1 January it activated its incident management support team, putting the organisation on an emergency footing.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/18/china-coronavirus-who-diplomatic-challenge\">China's handling of coronavirus is a diplomatic challenge for WHO</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The Taiwanese government has claimed that it did not receive a reply to its inquiry and was generally shut out from WHO deliberations. Since the UN voted to recognise the People\u2019s Republic as the sole representative of China in 1971 and the World Health Assembly followed suit in 1972, Taiwan has not had full member status in the WHO, but it is involved in the organisation\u2019s work.</p> \n<p>It is one of 15 non-state entities that have access to expert deliberations through an information network established by the International Health Regulations (IHR), a pact on collective action against infectious disease with roots stretching back to the nineteenth century. The latest version was agreed in 2005 by 196 countries, and it provides the legal framework for the work of the WHO.</p> \n<p>However, Taiwan says its participation is fragmentary and selective, largely because Chinese obstruction. A Taipei government statement pointed out that it reported its first confirmed coronavirus case on 21 January through the IHR system, but was not invited to participate in the three emergency committee meetings held in January, where its voice may have made a difference.</p> \n<p>Taiwanese experts were among the first to visit Wuhan, in the first half of January, and its containment measures later proved effective. Singapore, meanwhile, had two representatives on the committee.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe Covid-19 outbreak is a reminder to all the world once again, that politics has barred Taiwan from contact and communication with WHO and global public health experts, and this can only gravely damage global cooperation in epidemic prevention and control,\u201d the statement said.</p> \n<p>Tedros has also drawn criticism for his tireless praise of China and Xi Jinping\u2019s leadership, hailing Beijing\u2019s transparency despite the critical early weeks left when the authorities tried to cover up the extent of the problem in Wuhan. The director general\u2019s defenders say such diplomatic flattery is the price of ensuring Chinese cooperation with information and WHO site visits. Tedros also complimented Trump in a March 23 tweet, claiming he was doing \u201ca great job in the fight against Covid-19\u201d, and Trump was also effusive in praising Xi in the first weeks of the pandemic.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey\u2019re making it seem like he\u2019s a crony of China, but he\u2019s caught in the middle of a super power struggle competition,\u201d Gostin said.</p> \n<p>The WHO also provided ammunition to its detractors when, on 14 January, it put out <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1217043229427761152?s=20\">a tweet</a> citing preliminary Chinese studies finding \u201cno clear evidence of human-to-human transmission\u201d.</p> \n<p>It was issued on the same day the WHO\u2019s technical lead on Covid-19, Maria Van Kerkhove (a US immunologist) gave a press briefing in Geneva warning of precisely the opposite \u2013 the potential for rapid spread. Concerned that her briefing conflicted with the initial Chinese findings, a middle-ranking official told the social media team to put out a tweet to balance the Van Kerkhove briefing. In so doing, the WHO exposed itself to the charge of contributing to an air of complacency. But the tweet was factually true and does not appear to have been part of a deliberate strategy.</p> \n<p>Again and again, the events of January reflected the difficulties Tedros and his organisation faced in negotiating a path between two hostile superpowers, and the egos of their leaders, without any independent powers to enforce compliance and information sharing.</p> \n<p>However, what mistakes that may have been made in charting that course have little to do with the lethal fiasco that unfolded in the US in the two months after the WHO raised an international alarm.</p>",

This is based on the experiences of China and Italy, previous coronavirus hotspots.<br></p> \n  <p>But this model, like all predictions, is dynamic and depends upon the application of measures such as social distancing to slow the rate of transmission. Other forecasts have been more pessimistic, warning that it will be difficult to tame the spread of the virus until well after summer. Premature relaxation of restrictions on gatherings of people could see a second, much more severe, increase in infections. </p> \n  <p>The sheer size of the US, as well as its large population, means that there will be several \u2018peaks\u2019 at different times across the country.

It said that all deaths of people who had tested positive for Covid-19 needed to be recorded, whether they occurred in hospitals, homes or care homes.</p> \n  <p>On Friday, health ministry figures put the total number of cases in Spain at 188,068 \u2013 up 5,252 from the previous day. That suggests an overnight increase in new cases of 2.9%, which is well in line with recent daily increases \u2013 and markedly down from the 38% daily rise seen when the state of emergency was declared in Spain just over a month ago.</p> \n  <p>The same set of figures show an overnight death toll of 348 \u2013 well down on recent days. But speaking at his daily press conference, the head of Spain\u2019s centre for health emergencies put the overnight death toll at 585.</p> \n  <p>The new recording and reporting criteria also seem to have skewed the number of cured people. On Thursday, the health ministry said that 74,797 people across Spain had recovered. Twenty-four hours later, the total had dropped to 72,963.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had a problem with one autonomous region that was using two sources of information, and we\u2019ve come across some information that lacks the consistency we try to ensure when we offer figures,\u201d Fernando Sim\u00f3n told reporters.</p> \n  <p>Sim\u00f3n said the new data meant that past statistics needed to be revised and warned that it would be hard to gauge the coronavirus\u2019s true impact \u201cuntil the epidemic is over\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Official figures from the health ministry are based only on deaths of people who have tested positive for the coronavirus. But a lot of people are likely to have died from the virus without having been tested, meaning their deaths do not figure in the official count. </p> \n  <p>This is particularly the case in care homes, where thousands of people have died untested, but showing symptoms consistent with the coronavirus. According to figures analysed by El Pa\u00eds, <a href=\"https://english.elpais.com/society/2020-04-16/spanish-social-service-residences-have-seen-at-least-11600-coronavirus-deaths.html\">at least 11,600 people have died of the virus \u2013 or displaying symptoms associated with it \u2013 in Spanish care homes</a>.</p> \n  <p>Those deaths would account for almost two-thirds of the nationwide fatalities.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-17T13:33:53.287Z\">at 2.33pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9995b68f08cf571cdb2dec\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-17T11:42:31.834Z\">12.42pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Jamaican bobsledder Sam Clayton Jr, who inspired the popular Cool Runnings movie, <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/sam-clayton-dies-coronavirus-jamaica-bobsleigh-team-cool-runnings-1498502\">died late last month of coronavirus</a>. </p> \n  <p>The 58-year-old was part of the Jamaican bobsleigh team that qualified for the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Canada. </p> \n  <p>Clayton is survived by his wife, Annie, a daughter, three sons and three grandchildren.</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-17T13:34:14.022Z\">at 2.34pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9992848f08ea7431f44a44\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-17T11:38:13.059Z\">12.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Some <strong>European</strong> countries are beginning to ease lockdown restrictions on social life, transport and cross-border travel.
