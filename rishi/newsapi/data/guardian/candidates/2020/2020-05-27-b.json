  "<p>Good morning, this is Richard Parkin bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Thursday 28 May.</p> \n<h2>Top stories</h2> \n<p><strong>The&nbsp;New South Wales&nbsp;government has quietly paid out millions of dollars to more than a dozen former schoolchildren who it admits were abused by a paedophile</strong> teacher who rose through the ranks of the state\u2019s public school system over three decades while preying on young Indigenous boys. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/28/nsw-government-secretly-paid-millions-victims-teacher-paedophile-cletus-oconnor-indigenous-men\">Since April 2018, lawyers from the state\u2019s education department have signed out-of-court settlements with 14 men from across western&nbsp;NSW</a>. The men, who are all Indigenous, are predominantly based in Dubbo. The department has never publicly disclosed the settlements, which in some cases included confidentiality clauses preventing disclosure of the value of the payouts. Nor has it acknowledged the existence of a serial paedophile in the public school system, a step that might have encouraged others to come forward.</p> \n<p><strong>360 people have been arrested in Hong Kong, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/27/hong-kong-trump-china-security-crackdown-protests\">as thousands of armed police clashed with demonstrators</a> engaged in day-long protests,</strong> sparked by China\u2019s plans to introduce sweeping anti-sedition laws in the former British territory. Those arrested have been charged with offences including unauthorised assembly and possession of objects such as petrol bombs, with police firing pepper-spray bullets into assembled crowds, gathered to prevent the passing of a law criminalising ridicule of China\u2019s national anthem. The EU has called on China to respect Hong Kong\u2019s autonomy, but on Wednesday US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/27/hong-kong-china-autonomous-us-pompeo-security-law\">paved the way to revoke the territory\u2019s&nbsp;preferential trade and financial status</a>, telling Congress the Trump administration no longer regards Hong Kong as autonomous from mainland China.</p> \n<p><strong>Two-thirds of Australians in households where the main breadwinner has lost employment are living below the poverty line,</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/28/poverty-findings-heighten-calls-to\">a major new report has found</a>. The research commissioned by the Australian Council of Social Services also suggests those already relying on social security before Covid-19 were five times more likely to be living in poverty, with Acoss calling for a thorough overhaul of the benefits system in the light of the coronavirus pandemic.</p> \n<h2>Australia</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"af224490119d2e8360b15b8e95d4f5a7e41dbdbc\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af224490119d2e8360b15b8e95d4f5a7e41dbdbc/0_448_6720_4032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Power lines\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Australian Energy Market Commission is considering allowing electricity retailers with pandemic-affected customers to put network charges on hold.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carly Earl/The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Electricity retailers could be allowed to put network costs on hold amid fears bankruptcies could spark \u201cfinancial contagion\u201d, </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/28/australian-electricity-retailers-could-get-help-as-customers-struggle-to-pay-in-coronavirus-crisis\">the Australian Energy Market Commission has announced</a>.

  "<p>Opposition politicians in Tanzania have accused president John Magufuli of covering up a major outbreak of Covid-19 in the east African country.</p> <p>Magufuli has repeatedly played down the&nbsp;threat from the pandemic&nbsp;and&nbsp;refused to impose a&nbsp;strict lockdown&nbsp;as many other leaders on the continent have.</p> <p>Instead the 60-year-old has encouraged the country\u2019s 56 million inhabitants to keep working and socialising, while a key ally announced a three-day \u201ccorona party\u201d in Dar es Salaam, the commercial capital, this weekend to give thanks to God for what he claimed was a reduction in levels of infection.&nbsp;</p> <p>Tanzanian authorities have not released official date on infections for nearly a month, despite requests from the World Health Organization (WHO). There were 480 confirmed cases with 16 deaths on 29 April.&nbsp;</p> <p>However, the opposition&nbsp;politicians&nbsp;say they believe there have been more than 400 deaths in Dar es Salaam and&nbsp;between 16,000 and 20,000 cases nationwide, according to their own ongoing research.</p> <p>\u201cThe government say there are no patients in the hospitals but we know of three hospitals in Dar es Salaam where the ICU beds are all completely full,\u201d said Zitto Kabwe, leader of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Alliance for Change and Transparency.</p> <p>Many African countries have been praised for their response to the coronavirus. Though testing has been patchy and the true extent of the spread of the virus is unknown, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-4a11d568-2716-41cf-a15e-7d15079548bc\">there are still only 3,600 deaths and 120,000 confirmed cases</a> on the continent.</p> <p>Magufuli has rejected advice from the WHO on social distancing to restrict transmission of the disease, while laboratory officials were suspended earlier this month after the president said he had secret tests performed in which a papaya and a goat tested positive.&nbsp;</p> <p>Colleges and sports events will restart next month, along with international flights.</p> <p>International experts have watched developments in Tanzania with dismay. Senior officials at the WHO have made repeated requests for permission to offer extensive assistance in the country\u2019s fight against the pandemic.</p> <p>Earlier this month,&nbsp;the US embassy advised that&nbsp;\u201call available evidence pointed to&nbsp;exponential growth\u201d of Covid-19 cases in Dar es Salaam and other locations in Tanzania\u201d,&nbsp;and warned that&nbsp;\u201cmany hospitals \u2026 have been overwhelmed in recent weeks\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <p>The foreign ministry&nbsp;rejected&nbsp;the claim.</p> <p>Hassan Abbas,&nbsp;a&nbsp;government spokesman,&nbsp;said&nbsp;it would be impossible to cover up an outbreak&nbsp;and&nbsp;dismissed reports that hospitals were overwhelmed, noting that one, which has room for more than 160 patients, only had 11 in it.</p> <p>Magufuli cited several examples of improvement in a speech, notably at the Amana hospital in Dar es Salaam, where the number of patients reportedly dropped from 198 to 12.</p> <p>But the opposition&nbsp;accused authorities&nbsp;of emptying clinics in order to counter international concern.</p> <p>\u201cThe government decongested these hospitals in order to prove the US wrong \u2026 A number of patients were told to treat themselves at home. This will cause a very big problem in the next weeks,\u201d&nbsp;Kabwe&nbsp;said.&nbsp;</p> <p>The country\u2019s neighbours fear that a major outbreak could spill over the country\u2019s borders. Kenya imposed stringent testing measures on Tanzanian truck drivers after more than 50 of them tested positive for the virus in a single day.&nbsp;</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ZMPublicHealth/status/1263837915563479041/photo/3\">Districts&nbsp;in Zambia which border Tanzania&nbsp;have some of the highest levels of infection in the country.&nbsp;</a></p> <p>Though schools have been closed, churches in Tanzania have remained open.&nbsp;A devout Catholic, Magufuli has described the Covid-19 virus as \u201cthe devil\u201d and said it&nbsp;cannot survive in the body of Christ.&nbsp;In mid-March he ordered three days of national prayers against the disease.</p> <p>The&nbsp;son of a peasant farmer,&nbsp;Magufuli&nbsp;faces elections to win a second term later this year.&nbsp;Experts describe the veteran politician, who has a&nbsp;doctorate in chemistry and won his nickname \u2018The Bulldozer\u2019 as a minister, as a&nbsp;populist who likes to fly in the face of convention.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s set himself up as a firebrand leader who will do great things \u2026. But he\u2019s very popular and in charge of a dominant party. He\u2019s in a fairly solid position,\u201d said&nbsp;Prof&nbsp;Nic Cheeseman,&nbsp;an expert in African politics at&nbsp;Birmingham University.</p> <p>Magufuli&nbsp;was praised&nbsp;when he came to power in 2015 for his&nbsp;high-profile efforts to crack down&nbsp;on corruption but has grown increasingly authoritarian.</p> <p>\u201cThe problems with mistreatment are still continuing \u2026 There is a lot of pressure being put on the media,\u201d said Kabwe.</p> <p>Albert Msando, a lawyer, was arrested in late April after a video circulated showing him distributing masks to journalists and talking about the importance of the news media\u2019s role in informing the public, according to the Tanzania Human Rights Defenders Coalition.</p> <p>Three media organisations were fined for \u201ctransmission of false and misleading information\u201d about the government\u2019s response, and a newspaper had its online publishing license suspended.&nbsp;</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2019/08/tanzania-drop-trumped-up-charges-against-journalist/\">Erick Kabendera,&nbsp;an investigative journalist</a> spent seven months in prison on what Amnesty said were \u201ctrumped-up charges\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cPeople in Tanzania cannot express themselves,\u201d said Roland Ebole, an Amnesty International researcher based in Kenya.</p>",
  "<h2>Jimmy Kimmel</h2> <p>With Stephen Colbert, Trevor Noah, Seth Meyers and Jimmy Fallon on vacation this week, Jimmy Kimmel returned to air following a \u201cweird Memorial Day\u201d in shutdown. Still, despite physical distancing orders even in semi-reopened states, Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/22/donald-trump-churches-mosques-synagogues-reopen\">issued an executive order</a> this weekend to open churches, mosques, and other places of worship \u201cin an effort to make sure that the most devout Americans get a chance to contract the coronavirus too\u201d, said Kimmel.&nbsp;</p> <p>The order was a \u201ccontroversial decision, one that could endanger the lives of many,\u201d Kimmel continued, \u201cbut anyone who knows Donald Trump knows he\u2019s a man of great faith.\u201d</p> <p>As in, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/23/trump-golf-course-coronavirus\">he spent Sunday on the golf course</a>.</p> <p>\u201cIt looks bad for the president to be golfing with 100,000 Americans dead and a stay-at-home order in place,\u201d said Kimmel, \u201cbut try explaining optics to a guy who stared directly into an eclipse.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gqyezOA1kY\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3gqyezOA1kY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>Trump\u2019s \u201cbrazen hypocrisy\u201d gets even richer considering he once called into Fox &amp; Friends during Obama\u2019s presidency to complain Obama was slacking on his duties by golfing on occasional weekends. Kimmel contrasted the clip with how Fox &amp; Friends twisted Trump\u2019s outing: an example of him \u201cleading the way\u201d by getting back to normal during a pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cOh, so he\u2019s a hero? He\u2019s not \u2018golfing,\u2019 he\u2019s \u2018leading the way,\u2019\u201d Kimmel deadpanned. \u201cDo they know it\u2019s not safe to have your nose so far up the president\u2019s ass right now? There\u2019s a virus going around.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThese people have no shame, and no YouTube either,\u201d he continued. \u201cTrump spent what is supposed to be a weekend of gratitude and remembrance \u2013 Memorial Day \u2013 golfing, tweeting nutjob conspiracy theories and mocking Joe Biden for wearing a mask to a Memorial Day event.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/may/22/stephen-colbert-trump-masks-late-show-recap\">Colbert on Trump and masks: \u2018There would be enormous pleasure in seeing less of his face\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The mask bit is especially troubling, Kimmel continued, because it\u2019s a federal and CDC health guideline that has now become a political statement \u2013 whether or not you wear it shows which side you\u2019re on. Kimmel cycled through clips of crowded pool parties and beaches over the weekend in the Ozarks and Alabama, in which no one wore a mask; one young man told a local reporter he chose not to because the president doesn\u2019t wear one. Another clip: shoppers at a grocery store in Staten Island hounded a mask-less woman out of the store with ample swearing.</p> <p>\u201cOf all the fights we\u2019ve had over the last few years, this one makes the least sense,\u201d Kimmel concluded on the mask fights. \u201cThis is the dumbest standoff ever. We all want to go back to work, we all want to go back to eat, we all want to hang out, none of us want to see people die. So if wearing a mask can help slow the virus and get us back to normal sooner, why not wear a mask?\u201d</p> <p>Kimmel decided if you\u2019re not wearing a mask, you shouldn\u2019t wear sunscreen either. \u201cThat should be the rule \u2013 if you don\u2019t care about my wellbeing, you\u2019re not allowed to care about your own.

  "<p>Donald Trump has threatened to \u201cstrongly regulate\u201d or close down social media platforms that do not meet his standards for ideological balance, a day after Twitter, for the first time, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/26/trump-twitter-fact-check-warning-label\">slapped a warning label</a> on a pair of Trump tweets spreading lies about mail-in voting.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/27/george-floyd-sister-police-officers-should-be-charged-with-murder\">George Floyd killing: sister says police officers should be charged with murder</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>\u201cRepublicans feel that Social Media Platforms totally silence conservatives voices,\u201d Trump <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1265601611310739456\">tweeted</a> on Wednesday morning. \u201cWe will strongly regulate, or close them down, before we can ever allow this to happen.\u201d</p> \n<p>Kayleigh McEnany, the White House press secretary, told reporters traveling onboard Air Force One on Wednesday that Trump soon planned to sign an executive order on social media companies, but details remained scant.</p> \n<p>Trump also repeated his attacks on mail-in voting, which is common in the United States but could expand further during the coronavirus pandemic. Republicans fear that an expansion of the franchise could result in their members being ejected from office.</p> \n<p>Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/26/trump-pledges-curb-press-freedom-libel-laws-first-amendment\">in the past</a> has made threats about media censorship that he did not then act on, and any attempt by the White House to shutter a media organization would encounter first amendment challenges in the courts. In 2018 a federal judge <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/23/trump-twitter-block-ruling-court-public-forum-account\">ruled</a> the president could not block people on Twitter, because it violates their first amendment rights to participate in a \u201cpublic forum\u201d.</p> \n<p>As his election-year polling numbers have deteriorated, however, Trump has grown increasingly wild in his threats against media organizations and the voting system, and more aggressive in removing mechanisms for oversight in the federal government and in installing loyalists. His takeover of the federal courts could put future first amendment claims on new and dangerous ground.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s disturbing that the president misunderstands the first amendment so fundamentally,\u201d said Jameel Jaffer, the executive director at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University. \u201cThe only first amendment issue here arises from the president\u2019s threat to punish Twitter in some way for factchecking his statements.\u201d</p> \n<p>Most recently, Trump\u2019s attacks on mail-in voting and on a cable news host, Joe Scarborough, have created controversies and put a great deal of pressure on Twitter, Trump\u2019s preferred bullhorn, to modulate the president\u2019s speech.</p> \n<p>The husband of a former aide to Scarborough, who died when the MSNBC host was a member of Congress, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/may/26/lori-klausutis-husband-asks-twitter-delete-trump-joe-scarborough-smears-death\">formally asked Twitter this week</a> to remove \u201chorrifying\u201d tweets by Trump wrongfully and recklessly accusing Scarborough, a frequent Trump critic, of murder.</p> \n<p>Twitter declined to remove those tweets, citing a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jun/27/twitter-warning-labels-tweets-violate-site-rules\">relatively new policy</a> crafted with Trump in mind&nbsp;to allow itself to leave up tweets by \u201cworld leaders\u201d.</p> \n<p>But the company took unprecedented action on Tuesday in response to lies tweeted by Trump about mail-in voting. Twitter added links to the Trump tweets inviting users to \u201cget the facts about mail-in ballots\u201d.</p> \n<p>The company confirmed its decision was in keeping with its \u201ccivic integrity policy\u201d, which bars users from \u201cmanipulating or interfering in elections or other civic processes\u201d.</p> \n<p>Trump falsely claimed that state secretaries of state were mailing ballots to every citizen, and that mail-in voting invited fraud. In fact, the secretaries in question, including Republicans, had only mailed out ballot applications \u2013 not the ballots themselves \u2013 and mail-in voting, which is <a href=\"https://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/vopp-table-1-states-with-no-excuse-absentee-voting.aspx\">common in 34 states</a> and Washington DC, has not been vulnerable to fraud. Trump himself voted by mail in a primary this year in his home state of Florida.</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr, a frequent Twitter combatant in his father\u2019s cause, said the platform was more likely to ban \u201ca conservative for saying something not\u201d politically correct than to ban attacks on the president from the left. Trump Jr linked to a recent tweet by the comedian Kathy Griffin suggesting that Trump inject air, which the platform has not challenged.</p> \n<p>Claims that Twitter polices content from the right more aggressively than content from the left have been the subject of US Senate hearings, but no conclusive data has been compiled, in part because most of the most blatant violations of the platform\u2019s rules, racist and hate speech, are categorized as \u201cconservative\u201d.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"cf195534-d8a9-4d70-a05f-468077946a9b\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BfHFKD6oXC8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In the past, Trump has praised Twitter for allowing him to take his message directly to followers, and despite his claims of being \u201csilenced\u201d, social media platforms have been a boon for Trump. His current campaign has rebuilt a targeted advertising operation on Facebook that was widely credited with helping Trump win in 2016. Platforms like Facebook and Twitter were \u2013&nbsp;and are \u2013 staging grounds for foreign propaganda campaigns meant to scramble and empoison US politics and society. Those campaigns have also been credited with helping Trump\u2019s 2016 victory.</p> \n<p>The federal government has in the past attempted to enforce ideological balance for broadcast television, where licenses are controlled by the Federal Communications Commission. The FCC enforced a \u201cfairness doctrine\u201d for 40 years after the second world war, and still enforces an equal-time rule requiring stations to give competing political candidates the opportunity for equal exposure.</p> \n<p><em>Reuters contributed reporting</em></p>",

By having a hand in both voting litigation and the judges on the federal bench, this network could create a system where conservative donors have an avenue to both oppose voting rights and appoint judges to back that effort.</p> <p>Despite appearing to be a free-standing new operation, the Honest Elections Project is just a legal alias for the Judicial Education Project, a well-financed nonprofit connected to a powerful network of dark money conservative groups, according to business records reviewed by the Guardian and OpenSecrets.</p> <p>\u201cThese are really well-funded groups that in the context of judicial nominations have been systematically, over the long term but also the short term, kind of pushing an agenda to pack the courts with pretty extreme right wing nominees,\u201d said Vanita Gupta, the president and CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. \u201cThe infrastructure that they\u2019ve built over the years has been a really important vehicle for them to do this.\u201d</p> <p>For nearly a decade, the organization has been almost entirely funded by DonorsTrust, known as a <a href=\"https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/12/donors-trust-franklin-center-alec-mercatus-center-dark-money/\">\u201cdark money ATM\u201d</a> backed by the Koch network and other prominent conservative donors, according to data tracked by OpenSecrets. In 2018, more than 99% of the Judicial Education Project\u2019s funding came from a single $7.8m donation from DonorsTrust.</p> <p>The Judicial Education Project is also closely linked to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2019/investigations/leonard-leo-federalists-society-courts/\">Leonard Leo</a>, one of the most powerful people in Washington who has shaped Donald Trump\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/28/donald-trump-judges-create-new-conservative-america-republicans\">unprecedented effort to remake</a> the federal judiciary with conservative judges.</p> <p>The organization has deftly hidden the changes to its name from public view. In December, the Judicial Education Project formally <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6889358-Articles-of-Amedment-Judicial-Education-Project.html\">changed</a> its legal name to The 85 Fund, a group Leo backed to funnel \u201ctens of millions\u201d of dollars into conservative causes, <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/leonard-leo-crc-advisors-federalist-society-50d4d844-19a3-4eab-af2b-7b74f1617d1c.html\">according to Axios</a>. The Honest Elections Project is merely a <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6889355-The-85-Fund-Fictious-Name-Certificate-Honest.html\">fictitious name</a> \u2013 an alias \u2013 the fund legally adopted in February. The change was nearly indiscernible because The 85 Fund registered two other legal aliases on the same day, including <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6889356-The-85-Fund-Fictious-Name-Certificate-Judicial.html\">the Judicial Education Project</a>, its old name. The legal maneuver allows it to operate under four different names with little public disclosure that it is the same group.</p> <p>The Judicial Education Project is closely aligned with the Judicial Crisis Network, a group with unmatched influence in recent years in shaping the federal judiciary. The Judicial Crisis Network spearheaded the campaigns to get Gorsuch and Kavanaugh confirmed to the US supreme court, <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/analysis-opinion/conservative-group-behind-kavanaugh-confirmation-has-spent-years\">spending millions of dollars</a> in each instance. It has also spent significantly on critical state supreme court races across the country.</p> <p>There is a lot of overlap between the Honest Elections Project and the Judicial Crisis Network. Both groups share personnel, including Carrie Severino, the influential president of the Judicial Crisis Network. Both groups have been funded by The Wellspring Committee, a group Leo raised money for until it shut down in 2018. Both have also paid money to <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2018/11/trump-inauguration-money-links-secretive-dark-money/\">BH Group</a>, an LLC Leo once disclosed as his employer, that made a $1m mystery donation to Trump\u2019s inauguration.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ae693cf67675a1e7ab104313c04a22ed122393ff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae693cf67675a1e7ab104313c04a22ed122393ff/0_0_6000_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Honest Elections Project is part of the network that pushed the US supreme court picks Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Honest Elections Project is part of the network that pushed the US supreme court picks Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Doug Mills/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThis is a small community that is really trying to push forward these more suppressive tactics that will be challenged in court and having those judges on the bench, they\u2019re really hoping it\u2019s going to continue to rig the system in their favor,\u201d said Lena Zwarensteyn, who closely follows judicial nominations at the Leadership Conference. \u201cBy changing the rules of the game and who the referees are, they\u2019re trying to change the landscape.\u201d</p> <p>Neither the Honest Elections Project nor the Judicial Crisis Network responded to requests for an interview.</p> <p>The Honest Elections Project has become active as Republicans are scaling up their efforts to fight to keep voting restrictions in place ahead of the election. The Republican National Committee will spend at least <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/18/republicans-devote-20m-and-50000-people-into-efforts-to-restrict-voting\">$20m on litigation</a> over voting rights and wants to recruit up to 50,000 people to help monitor the polls and other election activities.</p> <p>Gupta said seeing a group that has been extremely successful in pushing judicial confirmations turn its attention to voting rights was alarming.</p> <p>\u201cIt isn\u2019t any surprise to those of us that do work in both of these spaces that our opponents [who] want to constrict access to voting, access to the courts, who are seeking an anti-inclusive, anti-civil rights agenda are one in the same,\u201d she said.</p>",

They recently came to public attention when Biden was accused by Tara Reade, a former staffer, of sexually assaulting her in a Capitol Hill basement in 1993.</p> <p>While vehemently denying that allegation in a TV interview on 1 May, the former vice-president simultaneously acknowledged the explosive potential of the archive\u2019s many other contents.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact is that there\u2019s a lot of things, of speeches I\u2019ve made, positions I\u2019ve taken, interviews that I did overseas with people, all of those things relating to my job, and the idea that they would all be made public in the fact while I was running for public office, they could be really taken out of context,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/us/politics/joe-biden-tara-reade-msnbc.html\">he told interviewer Mika Brzezinski</a> on MSNBC\u2019s Morning Joe program.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re papers or position papers, they are documents that existed and that \u2013 for example, when I met with [Vladimir] Putin or when I met with whomever, and all of that could be fodder in a campaign at this time.\u201d</p> <p>Biden, 77, also insisted that the collection does not contain personnel records, sending journalists on a wild goose chase through the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/04/joe-biden-tara-reade-senate-records-reject-request\">National Archives and Senate</a> in search of evidence of a complaint filed by Reade at the time of the alleged incident. The trail went cold, but the University of Delaware treasure trove remains tantalizing.</p> <p>Last week the Republican National Committee <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/rnc-ad-targets-university-of-delaware-records-amid-allegations-against-biden?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=pu_48&amp;utm_campaign=20200519_124569_&amp;utm_content=\">launched a digital advertising campaign</a>, raising questions about whether the university is keeping documents under seal related to the Reade allegation. One of the ads alleges: \u201cUniversity of Delaware is complicit in sexual assault cover-up.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.judicialwatch.org/\">Judicial Watch,</a> a rightwing activist group, is taking legal advice on whether it has grounds to take the university to court for access to the records. Its president, Tom Fitton, said on Thursday: \u201cIf we find that the documents are being withheld from us contrary to law, we are prepared to sue.\u201d</p> <p>Biden\u2019s defenders argue he is merely following precedent: past senators who ran for president have not been required to disclose all their papers. But Fitton contended: \u201cIt\u2019s not that they\u2019re being required; the question is whether the records are available under law. If he had them at his house, maybe there\u2019s an argument, but they\u2019re not at his house. They\u2019re at a university and subject to Foia [Freedom of Information Act].\u201d</p> <p>Biden\u2019s records were donated to the University of Delaware in 2012. The university did not respond to questions for this article but Andrea Boyle, a spokeswoman, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/30/politics/biden-senate-papers/index.html\">told CNN</a> earlier this month that it is still \u201ccurating the collection\u201d, a process likely to continue well into 2021, and the papers will not be released until two years after Biden retires from public life.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It sets up the Republican line perfectly, which is, \u2018What\u2019s he hiding?

Then there was his 2003 vote authorizing the invasion of Iraq, which he has since said he regrets.</p> <p>Furthermore, critics on the progressive wing of the Democratic party would be eager to scrutinize Biden\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/31/us/politics/banking-ties-could-hurt-joe-biden-in-race-with-populist-overtone.html\">links to the financial services industry,</a> a big player in Delaware. Conservatives might hunt for documents linking Biden\u2019s son, Hunter, to overseas business interests. In a replay of the 2016 campaign, when he encouraged Russia to hack Clinton\u2019s emails, Donald Trump may welcome a chance to make mischief by demanding \u201ctransparency\u201d.</p> <p>Larry Sabato, director of the <a href=\"http://centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/\">Center for Politics at the University of Virginia,</a> said: \u201cHis papers are much more voluminous than Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails, so I would expect there would be even more stories. Republicans are going to say, \u2018You just know there\u2019s some interesting material at the University of Delaware\u2019. No, there really isn\u2019t, but they know it\u2019s a safe thing to say because it can\u2019t be disproven before the election.\u201d</p> <p>There are practical objections, Sabato added, but Republicans will seek to turn those to their advantage. \u201cFirst of all, you couldn\u2019t publish it all or even open it all. He had an incredibly long career, a 50-year political career, and there are some personal items in there as well, from what I understand. How could you even manage to make it available to researchers, much less the general public, just a few months ahead of an election? It\u2019s not going to happen.</p> <p>\u201cTherefore, it sets up the Republican line perfectly, which is, \u2018What\u2019s he hiding? How come he won\u2019t show us?\u2019 No one out there is going to going to say, \u2018Well, of course, it\u2019s an enormous amount of material and why would he and most of it\u2019s junk,\u2019 which is true, by the way .\u201d</p> <p>Other presidential candidates have faced similar pressures. <a href=\"https://www.mullings.com/\">Rich Galen,</a> a campaign strategist for actor and former Republican senator Fred Thompson\u2019s unsuccessful 2008 bid, recalled: \u201cHis papers from the Senate were at the University of Tennessee and his opponents kept quacking about the fact that we had locked them up, literally, because we didn\u2019t want to go through every morning having some 12-year-old take five words out of a 300-word essay and have to defend it all day.</p> <p>\u201cSo we just said to hell with you, if that\u2019s what the fight is going to be about, then the fight will be about not getting access to the papers as opposed to what\u2019s in the papers. And it\u2019s a little hard to make the case that Biden won\u2019t give up the papers at the University of Delaware while Trump has been in federal court for 27 years to protect his financial records.\u201d</p>",

There are only 2,400 eastern bristlebirds in the wild and about 140 in the Howes Flat population near Mallacoota.</p> \n  <p>They caught the birds, described by the ecologist <strong>Dr Rohan Clarke

<strong>Josh Taylor</strong> at the bushfire Senate committee hearing ...</p> \n  <p>The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet faced questions at the Senate committee hearing on the 2019-20 bushfires over whether the prime minister, <strong>Scott Morrison</strong>, had been adequately briefed about the bushfires during the fire season last year.<br></p> \n  <p>PM&amp;C hadn\u2019t provided verbal or written briefings to him while he was in Hawaii from 15 to 21 December (he cut his trip short by two days), but that doesn\u2019t rule out the possibility that PMO was updating the PM on the situation.</p> \n  <p>The department secretary, <strong>Phil Gaetjens</strong>,<strong> </strong>told the committee that the PM was in Australia when the fires in Victoria, NSW and South Australia flared up in late November, and back when the state of emergency declarations were made in four states on 30 December, so it was incorrect to say he was absent during the crisis.</p> \n  <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a correct interpretation to say that the prime minister was not here in the crisis,\u201d he said.</p> \n  <p>Gaetjens himself was on leave for half of December, he told the committee.</p> \n  <p>The department confirmed that before Morrison left on holidays in Hawaii he was \u201cvery well informed\u201d about the bushfire situation via a series of teleconference meetings with the head of Emergency Management Australia and others in November.</p> \n  <p>\u201cIt seems to me that what you were telling us is that he would have had considerable knowledge about how extreme the crisis was and what was unfolding, yet he still decided to go off on holidays,\u201d the Greens senator <strong>Janet Rice</strong> replied.</p> \n </div> \n <p

Sure, I get that, no one expects them to be. But ministers and departments can talk to one another and talk to one another a bit better than what was, on the face of it, a pretty breezy email to a generic email account.</p> \n   <p>How you can send an email to a generic email address four hours before a ship is meant to dock in Fremantle, a large population centre, and expect it all to quickly happen over here in four hours. I mean that\u2019s a bit unbelievable as well. Again, I just don\u2019t know where Australia\u2019s border force is in all of this ...

The need to fund more domestic places so young people, and the thousands of other Australians whose jobs have disappeared, have tertiary education as a viable option. Past recessions have shown that, as unemployment rates soar, those who cannot earn enrol to learn.<br></p> \n  <p>2. The proposed \u201csafe corridors\u201d to bring international students into Australia needs to be implemented as soon as is safely possible so there is at least some chance of international students getting to Australia and clearing quarantine for the second part of this year. Failure to do this swiftly will add to the devastation of our international education, which contributed $40 billion to our economy each year before COVID-19.<br></p> \n  <p>3. International students, who are already in Australia, should be supported and encouraged to remain here. Community groups, state and local governments and have stepped up to support those who have been hard hit by job losses and exclusion from JobSeeker and JobKeeper. They do however need practical, ongoing help, coordinated at the national level that shows how we value them for their contributions to the Australian economy.</p> \n  <p>4. Cuts of up to 21000 jobs are underway as universities yet the Federal Government has ensured that universities \u2013 unlike other large businesses and some private universities \u2013 are ineligible for the JobKeeper subsidy. This does not make sense.</p> \n  <p>5. Researchers urgently need government assistance to ensure that they can continue and not waste work already done. Many research projects have already been suspended.</p> \n  <p>International researchers, who are very important to the sector, may not return to Australia to finish their work. Much of the $4.7 billion that universities put into research each year has been funded by revenue from international education. That revenue has now evaporated from a sector that is likely to take years to recover.<br></p> \n  <p>6. There is a need to re-start infrastructure projects that have been suspended as universities try to stop their financial haemorrhaging. The Victorian Government has allocated $350 million, which will greatly assist universities with capital projects in that state, but what about the rest of the nation?<br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-26T23:25:08.432Z\">at 12.25am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ecda35e8f0852d72995058d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-26T23:19:50.747Z\">12.19am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Hundreds of masks and plastic containers have washed up on Sydney\u2019s eastern beaches overnight.

  "<p>The final story in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/richard-ford\">Richard Ford</a>\u2019s new collection is a tale of a marriage gone wrong \u2013 though something, we know, is salvaged from the wreckage. \u201cJonathan and Charlotte were divorced but had stayed friends,\u201d \u201cSecond Language\u201d begins. The marriage is a second attempt for both of them. Jonathan is a widower; Charlotte\u2019s husband went off for a sailing trip and ended up making a new life without her. Confident Charlotte wasn\u2019t too cut up; she meets Jonathan, who is pleasingly wealthy, when she\u2019s selling him a fancy loft apartment.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The people in these stories seem imprisoned by a judgmental authorial voice</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One day a couple of years in, she realises \u201cthat she was not the most perfect person to be married to Jonathan Bell \u2013 even though she <em>was</em> married to him and liked him very much.\u201d She breaks this to him not long after he\u2019s had thyroid surgery \u2013 she \u201ctold Jonathan her news\u201d, is the way Ford describes their conversation; the information is all in her control. Yet the reader knows he will not react too badly; the story is, for the most part, an elegant meditation on the currents of adult relationships, and how far any of us can escape our histories. It is the strongest piece in this uneven book, yet there is still a laziness of observation which also mars, for the most part, the other tales.</p> <p>So we learn that Charlotte has two relationships after her divorce from her first husband: \u201cOne with an intense but too-diminutive brain surgeon, and one with a burly cop who wanted her to relocate to Staten Island.\u201d Isn\u2019t the stereotypical cop always burly \u2013 and always living on Staten Island? Women fare worse when it comes to this kind of slack description. Charlotte is \u201cforty-four, a tall, easily smiling, lanky, intelligent beauty\u201d. Is this how she thinks of herself? She had once been a model: \u201cHouse hunters often did double takes when she hauled \u2018those legs\u2019 out of the car to present a property.\u201d To whom do those quotation marks belong?</p> <p>Charlotte, at least, is slender. More than once, across the entirety of this collection, the reader feels as if she\u2019s in the presence of a speak-your-weight machine. In \u201cCrossing\u201d, Tom, a lawyer in the midst of finalising his divorce, observes a young woman: her \u201cplump hands. The placid blue-eyed gaze of profound un-interest \u2026 The waist an equator, the legs large in a too-tight brown skirt that rode up revealingly.\u201d In \u201cThe Run of Yourself\u201d, Peter Boyce\u2019s daughter Polly has \u201cadded more weight. She wore very tight blue jeans that weren\u2019t helping.\u201d Peter, like Jonathan in \u201cSecond Language\u201d, is a widower; his wife Mae has been dead for two years. She was stricken with cancer but took her own life before the disease could kill her; she is described as \u201cstarkly pretty and thin\u201d when dying of cancer.</p> <p>Ford is one of the grand figures of contemporary US literature: the Frank Bascombe trilogy of <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/audio/2013/apr/12/richard-ford-the-sportswriter-podcast\">The Sportswriter</a></em>, <em>Independence Day</em> and <em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/oct/08/fiction.features\">The Lay of the Land</a></em>, published between the mid-1980s and the early years of this century, are landmark books. His work has always been distinguished by the precision of his observation and his thoughtful dissection of American life in the years following the end of the Vietnam war. His characters\u2019 discontents \u2013 illness, divorce, estrangement \u2013 have always reflected the troubles of his native land.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/may/09/richard-ford\">Richard Ford: 'I didn't finish a book until I was 19'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But in <em>Sorry for Your Trouble</em>, that thoughtfulness is too often absent. Characters in stories are entitled to their perceptions of the world and those they observe. But the stories in this book come across as stale because, more often than not, the people in them seem imprisoned by a judgmental authorial voice. Most of these narratives concern the tribulations of middle-aged, middle-class men who find that life hasn\u2019t quite worked out as they\u2019d planned. In \u201cNothing to Declare\u201d the narrator encounters an old love and has yet another unsatisfactory encounter with her; in \u201cDisplaced\u201d, Henry recalls a youthful friendship gone wrong; in \u201cJimmy Green \u2013 1992\u201d Jimmy almost hooks up with a woman in Paris (\u201cthe flesh under her eyes was slightly wrinkled\u201d) against the backdrop of Bill Clinton\u2019s election to president. In earlier books Ford has painted these kinds of lives with wisdom and sensitivity; here, the characters\u2019 resistance to emotional depth leaks out into the narrative. Henry\u2019s friend Niall in \u201cDisplaced\u201d is a working-class kid trying to hide the fact that he\u2019s gay, but the broad brushstrokes tip him towards caricature rather than character.</p> <p>What\u2019s intriguing in \u201cSecond Language\u201d is the way in which both Jonathan and Charlotte seem, to a certain extent, to elude their author: that\u2019s what gives them a life beyond the page. The final tale here is the one that\u2019s worth waiting for.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Sorry for Your Trouble by Richard Ford is published by Bloomsbury (RRP \u00a316.99).

  "<p>\u201cI will never lie to you,\u201d declared Kayleigh McEnany <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/01/trump-lie-kayleigh-mcenany-press-secretary-coronavrius-michael-flynn\">on her debut </a>as the White House press secretary at the start of the month. \u201cYou have my word on that.\u201d</p> \n<p>That would be a welcome change, reasoned critics of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump\">Donald Trump</a>, but their hopes of a change in the way his administration communicates have been dashed.</p> \n<p>McEnany has stunned viewers with her evangelical devotion to the US president (\u201cwho I believe is one of the best presidents, if not the best president, this country will ever have\u201d), her straight-faced defence of his wildest conspiracy theories and her already-wearing-thin stunt of trying to turn the tables on reporters.</p> \n<p>Her briefing on Tuesday was, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/05/26/kayleigh-mcenanys-latest-briefing-is-case-study-gaslighting-whataboutism-false-claims/\">wrote the Washington Post,</a> \u201ca case study in gaslighting, whataboutism and false claims\u201d.</p> \n<p>Six times the press secretary was asked about tweets in which Trump promoted a totally debunked conspiracy theory about Joe Scarborough having some role in the death of Lori Klausutis, an aide who served in his office when he was a Republican member of Congress. Now a TV host on MSNBC, Scarborough and Trump spar constantly. Six times McEnany ducked the questions.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/10/kayleigh-mcenany-donald-trump-white-house-press-secretary-profile\">Kayleigh McEnany \u2013 the 'acceptable' face of Trumpism who infuriates liberals</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Klausutis died in 2001 after losing consciousness from an abnormal heart rhythm and hitting her head on a desk. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/may/26/lori-klausutis-husband-asks-twitter-delete-trump-joe-scarborough-smears-death\">Her widower has asked Twitter</a> to delete Trump\u2019s posts, arguing that he \u201chas taken something that does not belong to him \u2013 the memory of my dead wife \u2013 and perverted it for perceived political gain\u201d.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/04/front-row-at-the-trump-show-jonathan-karl-book\">Jon Karl,</a> the White House correspondent of ABC News, asked: \u201cWhy is the president making these unfounded allegations? This is pretty nuts, isn\u2019t it? The president is accusing somebody of possible murder? The family is pleading with the president to please stop unfounded conspiracy theories. Why is he doing it?\u201d</p> \n<p>McEnany studied her binder of notes then sought to deflect by pointing to a 2003 radio programme in which host Don Imus can be heard telling a joke about the death of an intern and Scarborough is heard laughing.</p> \n<p>\u201cWell, you know, I would note that the president said this morning that this is not an original Trump thought, and it is not. In fact, in 2003, on Don Imus\u2019s show, it was Don Imus and Joe Scarborough that joked about killing an intern \u2013 joked and laughed about it. So that was, I\u2019m sure, pretty hurtful to Lori\u2019s family.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5a585920d784c54cf9c733b09a486d210be2893c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a585920d784c54cf9c733b09a486d210be2893c/0_117_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kayleigh McEnany holds a press briefing in Washington on Monday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kayleigh McEnany holds a press briefing in Washington on Monday.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Ernst/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>On Tuesday McEnany was also asked about Trump\u2019s tweets that appeared to mock rival <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden\">Joe Biden</a> for wearing a face mask at a Memorial Day event on Monday. She gave an odd reply: \u201cIt is a bit peculiar though that, in his basement, right next to his wife, he\u2019s not wearing a mask, but he\u2019s wearing one outdoors when he\u2019s socially distanced. So I think that there was a discrepancy there.\u201d</p> \n<p>And as at previous briefings, McEnany also recycled mendacious and misleading claims about \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/12/what-is-obamagate-and-why-is-trump-so-worked-up-about-it\">Obamagate</a>\u201d and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-russia-inquiry\">Russia investigation</a>. \u201cJohn Brennan, of all of the \u2013 I\u2019ll call them bad actors, because indeed they were \u2013 of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/barack-obama\">Obama</a> administration, John Brennan probably has the most to answer,\u201d she said of the former CIA director.</p> \n<p>The instant verdict on McEnany was scathing. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/joelockhart\">Joe Lockhart,</a> a former White House press secretary under Bill Clinton, tweeted: \u201cPressSec entire defense of the president heartlessly causing pain to a Florida family to gain some perceived political position or punish an enemy is to repeatedly talk about an interview that was done in 2003. It is beyond disgraceful and pathetic. Someone come up w/ the word.\u201d</p> \n<p>The incident captured growing dismay over the way McEnany, 32, Trump\u2019s fourth press secretary, has approached the position. At first glance, she is cordial with reporters and goes out of her way to include all present in the question and answer sessions. But she also becomes highly combative and has a tendency to end briefings by grilling journalists for not focusing on subjects of her choosing \u2013 a move bound to enthrall the Trump base.</p> \n<p>Last week, for example, she offered unsolicited advice on what to ask about the case of Trump\u2019s former national security adviser <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/michael-flynn\">Michael Flynn</a>. \u201cI would like to lay out a series of questions and perhaps, if I write them out in a slide format \u2013 maybe we\u2019re visual learners and you guys will follow up with journalistic curiosity,\u201d she said in a tone many found patronising.</p> \n<p>In response, Chris Wallace, the host of Fox News Sunday, <a href=\"https://www.mediaite.com/tv/chris-wallace-blasts-kayleigh-mcenany-never-seen-a-press-secretary-act-like-that-we-were-never-lectured-on-what-to-ask/\">told viewers this weekend:</a> \u201cI spent six years in the White House briefing room covering Ronald Reagan. I have to say, I never \u2013 and in the years since too \u2013 I never saw a White House press secretary act like that.\u201d</p> \n<p>Wallace added: \u201cKayleigh McEnany isn\u2019t acting like she\u2019s working for the public. She acts like she is what she used to be, which is a spokesperson for the Trump campaign.\u201d</p> \n<p>Appearing on the same show, Jonah Goldberg, the editor-in-chief of the Dispatch website, described McEnany\u2019s behaviour as \u201cindefensible and grotesque\u201d.</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cWhat Donald Trump wants in a press secretary is a Twitter troll who goes on attack, doesn\u2019t actually care about doing the job they have and instead wants to impress, really, an audience of one and make another part of official Washington another one of these, essentially, cable news and Twitter laboratory arenas.\u201d</p> \n<p>In June 2015, McEnany had condemned Trump as a \u201cshowman\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/10/kayleigh-mcenany-donald-trump-white-house-press-secretary-profile#maincontent\">but she quickly leaped about the Trump train.</a> May\u2019s briefings suggest she will ride it all the way to the November election.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/kurtbardella?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Kurt Bardella,</a> a political commentator and columnist, said: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen that, unsurprisingly, Kayleigh McEnany is treating the job of White House press secretary as being the chief spokesperson for the Trump re-election campaign.\u201d</p>",

The death toll stands at 346,700. True death tolls and cases are likely to be significantly higher due to differing definitions and testing rates, delays and suspected underreporting.</li> \n   <li><strong>WHO warns of \u2018second peak\u2019 in areas where Covid-19 is declining. </strong>Countries where coronavirus infections are declining could still face an \u201cimmediate second peak\u201d if they let up too soon on measures to contain the outbreak, the World Health Organization said on Monday. The WHO emergencies chief, Dr Mike Ryan, told an online briefing: \u201cWe cannot make assumptions that just because the disease is on the way down now it is going to keep going down and we are get a number of months to get ready for a second wave. We may get a second peak in this wave.\u201d</li> \n   <li><strong>The UN refugee agency said Covid-19 had pushed its humanitarian work to near \u201cbreaking point\u201d in Yemen, a country devastated by five years of war</strong>. It <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/26/coronavirus-live-news-covid-19-uupdates-who-drops-hydroxychloroquine-trial-as-mexico-death-toll-questioned?page=with:block-5eccf3f38f08a1782fa81a50#block-5eccf3f38f08a1782fa81a50\">said</a> a growing number of families were resorting to begging, child labour and marrying of children to survive. A separate UN agency said it had only received around 15% of the funding required for the $3.38bn (\u20ac3bn) aid package for Yemen this year.</li> \n   <li><strong>Mexico City records thousands more deaths than usual, amid doubt over official Covid-19 toll. </strong>This year, Mexico City has issued <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/mexico-city-records-thousands-more-deaths-than-usual-amid-doubt-over-official-covid-19-toll\">8,072 more death certificates than the average</a> for the same period in the past four years, according to a study that suggests the country\u2019s coronavirus death toll could be significantly higher than the official figure of nearly 7,400. The report\u2019s authors found 37% more death certificates were issued in April 2020 than that month\u2019s average during the previous four years. By the end of May they estimated the number may grow to 120%.</li> \n   <li><strong>The UK death toll passed 47,000, according to new figures from the country\u2019s Office for National Statistics</strong>. This figure is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/26/coronavirus-live-news-covid-19-uupdates-who-drops-hydroxychloroquine-trial-as-mexico-death-toll-questioned?page=with:block-5ecce3d88f0886ce4f5da681#block-5ecce3d88f0886ce4f5da681\">higher</a> than the latest figure given by the UK government \u2013 nearly 37,000 \u2013 because it includes deaths in which Covid-19 is given as a \u201csuspected\u201d cause. The UK government figure only includes deaths of patients who have tested positive for the coronavirus.</li> \n   <li><strong>Russia reports record one-day rise in deaths. </strong>Russia has announced that 174 people with coronavirus have died in the past 24 hours, a record one-day amount that has pushed the nationwide death toll to 3,807. Officials reported 8,915 new cases, pushing its overall case tally to 362,342.</li> \n   <li><strong>White House brings forward Brazil travel restrictions by two days. </strong>The US has amended the timing of its Brazil travel ban to come into force at 11.59pm Washington time on Tuesday. It came as Brazil recorded a daily death toll higher than the US for the first time (807 versus 620). Brazil has the world\u2019s second highest number of infections. In its original announcement, the White House said the travel restrictions would come into force on 28 May.</li> \n   <li><strong>Dutch PM Mark Rutte did not visit dying mother due to Covid-19 restrictions. </strong>The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, was unable to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/dutch-pm-mark-rutte-did-not-visit-dying-mother-due-to-covid-19-restrictions\">visit his dying mother</a> in her final weeks because he obeyed coronavirus restrictions against visiting care homes, his office has said. His mother did not die of Covid-19, although there had earlier been an outbreak of the disease in the home where she was living, Dutch media reported.</li> \n   <li><strong>UK PM\u2019s aid refuses to apologise or resign over lockdown breach. </strong>The British prime minister Boris Johnson\u2019s senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, has refused to apologise or resign for breaching lockdown rules. Cummings drove 264 miles from London to his parents\u2019 estate in Durham, despite suspecting that both he and his wife had coronavirus. Cummings <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/25/dominic-cummings-refuses-to-resign-or-apologise-for-lockdown-breach\">also admitted to having taken a second trip</a>, to a beauty spot 30 miles from Durham, which he claimed was necessary to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/may/25/dominic-cummings-says-he-drove-to-barnard-castle-to-test-his-eyesight-video\">check his eyesight</a> was good enough for the longer drive back to London.</li> \n   <li><strong>WHO suspends hydroxychloroquine trial. </strong>The World Health Organization has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/25/who-world-health-organization-hydroxychloroquine-trial-trump-coronavirus-safety-fears\">suspended testing the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine in Covid-19 patients</a> due to safety concerns.

See you all tomorrow!</p> \n  <p>My colleague Simon Burnton will take it from here. In the meantime, these are the main developments from the last few hours: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Confirmed cases worldwide near 5.5m. </strong>According to the Johns Hopkins University coronavirus tracker, infections worldwide number at least 5,495,061. The death toll stands at 346,232. True death tolls and cases are likely to be significantly higher due to differing definitions and testing rates, delays and suspected underreporting.</li> \n   <li><strong>WHO warns of \u2018second peak\u2019 in areas where Covid-19 is declining. </strong>Countries where coronavirus infections are declining could still face an \u201cimmediate second peak\u201d if they let up too soon on measures to contain the outbreak, the World Health Organization said on Monday. The WHO emergencies chief, Dr Mike Ryan, told an online briefing: \u201cWe cannot make assumptions that just because the disease is on the way down now it is going to keep going down and we are get a number of months to get ready for a second wave. We may get a second peak in this wave.\u201d</li> \n   <li><strong>Mexico City records thousands more deaths than usual, amid doubt over official Covid-19 toll. </strong>This year, Mexico City has issued <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/mexico-city-records-thousands-more-deaths-than-usual-amid-doubt-over-official-covid-19-toll\">8,072 more death certificates than the average</a> for the same period in the past four years, according to a study that suggests the country\u2019s coronavirus death toll could be significantly higher than the official figure of nearly 7,400. The report\u2019s authors found 37% more death certificates were issued in April 2020 than that month\u2019s average during the previous four years. By the end of May they estimated the number may grow to 120%.</li> \n   <li><strong>White House brings forward Brazil travel restrictions by two days. </strong>The US has amended the timing of its Brazil travel ban to come into force at 11.59pm Washington time on Tuesday. It came as Brazil recorded a daily death toll higher than the US for the first time (807 versus 620). Brazil has the world\u2019s second highest number of infections. In its original announcement, the White House said the travel restrictions would come into force on 28 May.</li> \n   <li><strong>Dutch PM Mark Rutte did not visit dying mother due to Covid-19 restrictions. </strong>The Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, was unable to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/dutch-pm-mark-rutte-did-not-visit-dying-mother-due-to-covid-19-restrictions\">visit his dying mother</a> in her final weeks because he obeyed coronavirus restrictions against visiting care homes, his office has said. His mother did not die of Covid-19, although there had earlier been an outbreak of the disease in the home where she was living, Dutch media reported.</li> \n   <li><strong>UK PM\u2019s aid refuses to apologise or resign over lockdown breach. </strong>The British prime minister Boris Johnson\u2019s senior adviser, Dominic Cummings, has refused to apologise or resign for breaching lockdown rules. Cummings drove 264 miles from London to his parents\u2019 estate in Durham, despite suspecting that both he and his wife had coronavirus. Cummings <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/25/dominic-cummings-refuses-to-resign-or-apologise-for-lockdown-breach\">also admitted to having taken a second trip</a>, to a beauty spot 30 miles from Durham, which he claimed was necessary to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/may/25/dominic-cummings-says-he-drove-to-barnard-castle-to-test-his-eyesight-video\">check his eyesight</a> was good enough for the longer drive back to London.</li> \n   <li><strong>WHO suspends hydroxychloroquine trial. </strong>The World Health Organization has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/25/who-world-health-organization-hydroxychloroquine-trial-trump-coronavirus-safety-fears\">suspended testing the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine in Covid-19 patients</a> due to safety concerns. The WHO\u2019s director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, cited <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/may/22/hydroxychloroquine-trumps-covid-19-cure-increases-deaths-global-study-finds\">a paper published last week in the Lancet</a> that showed people taking hydroxychloroquine were at higher risk of death and heart problems than those who were not taking it. In light of the study, he said, the organisation would pause the hydroxychloroquine arm of its solidarity global clinical trial.</li> \n   <li><strong>Coronavirus measures \u2018disastrous\u2019 for children, says Dutch watchdog. </strong>The coronavirus pandemic will have a \u201cdisastrous\u201d impact on children\u2019s rights worldwide, making them more vulnerable to forced labour and underage marriage, a rights group said on Tuesday. School closures left boys and girls more vulnerable to child labour, early marriage and teenage pregnancy, while millions would fall into extreme poverty because of the coronavirus outbreak, the NGO KidsRights said.</li> \n   <li><strong>Australia will not open the country\u2019s borders \u2018anytime soon\u2019. </strong>Australia will not open the country\u2019s borders \u201canytime soon\u201d, the PM, Scott Morrison, said on Tuesday, but added the country would continue its discussions with neighbouring New Zealand about a trans-Tasman safe travel zone. \u201cI was speaking with Prime Minister Ardern this morning, and we\u2019ll continue to have our discussions about the trans-Tasman safe travel zone,\u201d Morrison told the National Press Club in Canberra.</li> \n   <li><strong>Masks too dangerous for children under two, Japan medical group says. </strong>Children under the age of two shouldn\u2019t wear masks because they can make breathing difficult and increase the risk of choking, a Japan medical group has said, launching an urgent appeal to parents as the country reopens from the coronavirus crisis.</li> \n   <li><strong>Saudi Arabia to revise curfew times. </strong>Saudi Arabia will revise curfew times this week, and lift them entirely across the kingdom with the exception of the holy city of Mecca, starting on 21 June, state news agency reported in a statement early on Tuesday. Bans on domestic travel, holding prayers in mosques, and workplace attendance in both the government and private sector will be lifted, starting 31 May, the statement added. For Mecca, the curfew time will be adjusted to 3pm-6pm and prayers will be allowed to be held in mosques from 21 June.</li> \n   <li><strong>Iceland eases national alert. </strong>Iceland eased its national alert against the coronavirus on Monday, allowing for public gatherings of up to 200 people and night clubs and gyms to reopen as the country nears complete recovery from the outbreak. Iceland, which limited the virus spread through a meticulous test-and-trace strategy and a full lockdown, has confirmed 1,804 infections and 10 deaths. But there have been only five reported new cases in May, and more than 99% of infected persons have recovered.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/coronavirus-latest-at-a-glance-26-may\">Coronavirus latest: at a glance</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-05-26T06:22:11.474Z\">at 7.22am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ecca31d8f0864e579f17a87\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-26T05:56:05.986Z\">6.56am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Global report: 'disaster' looms for millions of children as WHO warns of second peak</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The coronavirus pandemic will have a \u201cdisastrous\u201d impact on children\u2019s rights worldwide, making them more vulnerable to forced labour and underage marriage, a rights group has said, as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/world-health-organization\">World Health Organization</a> warned of an \u201cimmediate second peak\u201d in cases if restrictions were lifted too soon.</p> \n  <p>Millions of children would fall into extreme poverty because of the outbreak, which has left governments short of money for health and education for the young, Dutch NGO KidsRights said.</p> \n  <p>The NGO\u2019s warning came as the WHO emergencies head, Dr Mike Ryan, spoke of a potential second wave of infections at any time, especially if measures to halt the first wave were lifted too soon.</p> \n  <p>He said: \u201cWe cannot make assumptions that just because the disease is on the way down now it is going to keep going down and we are get a number of months to get ready for a second wave.

WHO emergencies head Dr Mike Ryan told an online briefing, \u201cWe cannot make assumptions that just because the disease is on the way down now it is going to keep going down and we are get a number of months to get ready for a second wave.

They were applied \u2013 hours after the tweets initially went out \u2013 because Trump\u2019s tweets violated Twitter\u2019s \u201ccivic integrity policy\u201d, a company spokeswoman confirmed, which bars users from \u201cmanipulating or interfering in elections or other civic processes\u201d, such as by posting misleading information that could dissuade people from participating in an election.</p> <p>Trump responded on Tuesday evening with a pair of tweets that repeated his false claims about voting and accused Twitter of \u201cinterfering in the 2020 Presidential Election\u201d. \u201cTwitter is completely stifling FREE SPEECH, and I, as President, will not allow it to happen!\u201d he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1265427539008380928\">wrote</a>. <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/issues/bloggers/legal/liability/230\">Federal law</a> protects the rights of internet platforms to moderate the third-party speech they publish.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s tweets include numerous false statements about California\u2019s plan to expand access to voting by mail in November due to the coronavirus outbreak. The tweets now feature a light blue exclamation point icon, with the message \u201cGet the facts about mail-in ballots\u201d. The alert label may not be visible when the tweets are embedded in another web page, such as below.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1265255845358645254\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">....living in the state, no matter who they are or how they got there, will get one. That will be followed up with professionals telling all of these people, many of whom have never even thought of voting before, how, and for whom, to vote. This will be a Rigged Election. No way!</p>&mdash; Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1265255845358645254?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 26, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Clicking on the alert will link users to a \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/i/events/1265330601034256384\">Twitter-curated page</a>\u201d that variously describes Trump\u2019s claims as \u201cunsubstantiated\u201d and false. The Twitter page also aggregates tweets from a number of journalists and publications explaining why Trump\u2019s statements are false.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s claims about California on Tuesday were blatantly wrong. The state is not sending a ballot to anyone who lives in the state but rather those registered there. Sam Mahood, a spokesman for the secretary of state, Alex Padilla, said in an email only active voters in the state would be mailed ballots.</p> <p>As states prepare for an unprecedented surge in mail-in voting because of the Covid-19 pandemic, Trump has repeatedly made baseless claims that this will lead to fraud. Voter fraud is <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/issues/ensure-every-american-can-vote/vote-suppression/myth-voter-fraud\">extremely rare</a> and one analysis found just <a href=\"https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/494189-lets-put-the-vote-by-mail-fraud-myth-to-rest\">143 convictions involving</a> mail-in ballot fraud since 2000, representing 0.00006% of the ballots cast during that time period.</p> <p>Trump, who voted by mail in Florida in March, has made it clear that he opposes any effort to make it easier to vote by mail for all eligible voters, including sending an absentee ballot application to all voters, a measure the Republican National Committee does not oppose. In March, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/30/trump-republican-party-voting-reform-coronavirus\">he said</a> Democratic efforts in Congress to expand mail-in voting would make it so \u201cyou\u2019d never have a Republican elected in this country again\u201d. Studies have shown neither Democrats nor Republicans benefit from a switch to a vote-by-mail system.</p> <p>Trump also attacked efforts to increase mail-in voting in Michigan and Nevada last week. He falsely <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/20/trump-threatens-cut-states-election-funding-mail-in-ballot-plans\">said Michigan</a> was sending absentee ballots to all registered voters; in fact the state was only sending an absentee ballot application. Trump later deleted his tweet and reposted a new one accusing the secretary of state of unlawfully sending the applications, something the secretary of state says is well within her authority.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Brad Parscale, lambasted Twitter\u2019s decision in a statement, framing it as an attempt by \u201cSilicon Valley\u201d to \u201cobstruct and interfere with President Trump getting his message through to voters\u201d. Parscale also asserted that Twitter\u2019s \u201cclear political bias\u201d was a reason that the Trump campaign pulled its advertising from Twitter \u201cmonths ago\u201d.</p> <p>Twitter <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/30/twitter-ban-political-advertising-us-election\">banned all political advertising</a> in November 2019, more than six months ago. At the time, Parscale decried the global policy change as \u201canother attempt by the left to silence Trump and conservatives\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/oct/30/twitter-ban-political-advertising-us-election\">Twitter to ban all political advertising, raising pressure on Facebook</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Experts on misinformation raised questions about whether Twitter\u2019s measure would be effective. Mike Caulfield, head of the Digital Polarization Initiative of the American Democracy Project, noted that the \u201cGet the facts\u201d phrasing could further entrench misinformation with its \u201clegitimizing tone\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cGet the facts implies there is a debate where facts are being marshalled in evidence,\u201d he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/holden/status/1265406538602053632\">wrote</a> on Twitter. \u201cIt elevates the claim.\u201d</p> <p>Claire Wardle, the director of First Draft News, also questioned whether Twitter\u2019s information page would be effective in changing any minds.</p> <p>\u201cIf we are to consider the reasoning behind this, it\u2019s not a belief that this will change anyone\u2019s minds, it\u2019s to provide necessary context to a tweet that should be taken down, but if they did that would lead to more conspiratorial thinking,\u201d she said. \u201cThey\u2019re stuck between a rock and hard place.\u201d</p>"
