This \u201cexceptional\u201d crisis measure gave the government temporary constitutional powers to introduce restrictions during the pandemic. Now the government is planning legislation allowing it to lift the state of emergency while keeping certain measures to avoid a second wave of Covid-19.</p> \n  <p>The number of patients in intensive care units in hospitals with the virus has dropped to below 1,000, from a spike of more than 7,000 in April, and the number of deaths each day is falling.

These measures would last until November, but could be changed according to circumstances. The law would not give the French authorities the power to reimpose a lockdown; if the virus suddenly returns, the government will have to seek a decree authorising new restrictions over the whole or part of France, Matignon, the French equivalent of Number 10, said.</p> \n  <p>France\u2019s external borders are currently closed to all but essential workers and those with a \u201ccompelling\u201d reason to enter the country.

One in four tests conducted in the country come back positive, the WHO said, which indicates a high level of infection. </p> \n  <p>Here are the key developments from the last few hours: </p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Brazil restored on Tuesday detailed Covid-19 data to the official national website,</strong> following a scandal about the removal of cumulative totals and a ruling by a Supreme Court justice that the full set of information be reinstated.<br>The detailed information, with cumulative totals and breakdowns by state, was restored to the website https://covid.saude.gov.br/, Reuters confirmed on Tuesday afternoon.</li> \n   <li><strong>The World Health Organization\u2019s Covid-19 technical lead backtracked on her comment that asymptomatic transmission of the virus was \u201cvery rare\u201d</strong>. \u201cI think that it\u2019s a misunderstanding to state the asymptomatic transmission globally is very rare,\u201d Dr Maria Van Kerkhove said, noting modelling suggesting 40% of infections could be transmitted by people without symptoms.</li> \n   <li><strong>A group of EU member states called for medical and equipment stockpiles to be increased.</strong> The leaders of Denmark, Spain and Germany, as well as France, Belgium and Poland, called for measures to boost the bloc\u2019s long-term resilience to public health crises and backed proposals for shared research and development of vaccines and treatment.</li> \n   <li><strong>The epidemic in Mexico is advancing toward its peak level of infections, the World Health Organization warned.</strong> Mexico, where total confirmed cases exceed 120,000 and the death toll stands at about 14,000, began a gradual re-opening of the economy at the start of June.</li> \n   <li><strong>Pakistan should implement intermittent lockdowns to counter a surge in infections, the World Health Organization advised</strong>. The increase has come as the country was loosening restrictions.</li> \n   <li><strong>Zoos, safari parks and drive-in cinemas will be allowed to reopen in England from 15 June. </strong>Boris Johnson will make the official announcement on Wednesday.</li> \n   <li><strong>There have been </strong><strong>sharp rises in reports of violence against women across Latin America</strong>, already a hotspot for gender-based violence, since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, the International Rescue Committee has said. Meghan Lopez, the IRC\u2019s regional director for Latin America, said some women and girls were stuck with perpetrators 24 hours a day.</li> \n   <li><strong>The world faces a food crisis worse than any seen for at least 50 years, the UN has warned</strong>. Social protections for poor people are urgently needed as the looming recession following the Covid-19 pandemic may put basic nutrition out of reach.<br></li> \n   <li><strong>A supreme court judge in Brazil has ordered Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s administration to resume publishing complete Covid-19 statistics</strong>. His government sparked outrage on Saturday by purging the health ministry website of data on to pandemic and announcing it would stop publishing the death toll or number of infections.</li> \n   <li><strong>Nearly one in five people in Iran may have been infected with coronavirus since the country\u2019s outbreak</strong>, a health official said. This meant the virus was \u201cmuch less lethal than we or the world had anticipated\u201d, said Ehsan Mostafavi, a member of the taskforce set up to combat Covid-19.</li> \n   <li><strong>Face masks will remain compulsory in all public spaces even after Spain\u2019s Covid-19 state of emergency ends on 22 June.</strong> \u201cThe message is one of prudence and caution,\u201d said the government spokeswoman, Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas Montero. \u201cUntil there is a vaccine or a treatment, the virus remains a threat. We can\u2019t think that the danger has gone.\u201d</li> \n   <li><strong>Fifty-two Cuban medics who flew to Italy to help doctors treat Europe\u2019s first mass coronavirus outbreak returned home to a heroes\u2019 welcome</strong>. The medical brigade, comprising 36 doctors, 15 nurses and a logistics specialist, arrived in Milan on 22 March and were the first ever to be deployed to a European country.</li> \n   <li><strong>Up to 600 deaths in Kano, northern Nigeria, most within a single week in April, were caused by an undetected outbreak of Covid-19, officials said</strong>. Government investigations, which began after reports of hundreds of deaths caused alarm in Nigeria\u2019s second largest city, linked 50-60% of 979 \u201cmysterious\u201d deaths to the virus.</li> \n   <li><strong>Coronavirus may have been present and spreading in Wuhan as early as August last year</strong>, according to a study that analysed satellite imagery of car parks outside major hospitals and search engine data.</li> \n  </ul> \n </div> \n</div>",

Therefore, my Administration will not even consider the renaming of these Magnificent and Fabled Military Installations \u2026 Our history as the Greatest Nation in the World will not be tampered with. Respect our Military!\u201d</p> <p>Trump listed several bases such as Fort Bragg in North Carolina, Fort Hood in Texas and Fort Benning in Georgia, all of which are named after prominent Confederate war leaders.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a statue&nbsp;of Christopher Columbus, the 15th-century Italian explorer who opened up the Americas for conquest and colonization by Europeans, was torn down by anti-racism protesters in Virginia. The activists set it on fire and threw it into a lake, in the latest action against historic monuments in the wake of Floyd\u2019s death.&nbsp;</p> <p>Elsewhere, another statue of Columbus in&nbsp;Boston\u2019s Atlantic Avenue&nbsp;in Massachusetts was beheaded.</p> <p>On Monday, a court in Virginia temporarily blocked moves by the state governor, Ralph Northam, to remove a huge statue of the Confederate general Robert E Lee from the state capital, Richmond.</p> <p>This was the same general whose statue in Charlottesville, Virginia, became a focus of a rally of the far right in 2017, where a counter-protester was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/15/charlottesville-car-attack-eyewitnesses-virginia-heather-heyer\">killed</a>. Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/15/donald-trump-press-conference-far-right-defends-charlottesville\">said</a> there were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/aug/16/charlottesville-violence-right-left-trump\">very fine people</a> \u201con both sides\u201d.</p> <p>On Wednesday, Virginia\u2019s attorney general vowed to defend Northam\u2019s plan to remove the Lee statue in Richmond.</p> <p>The governor had both \u201cthe authority and the moral obligation\u201d to do so, Mark Herring said in a new court filing.</p> <p>Also on Wednesday, House Speaker <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/nancy-pelosi\">Nancy Pelosi</a> urged Congress to take steps to remove from the US Capitol 11 statues representing Confederate leaders and soldiers from the civil war. \u201cTheir statues pay homage to hate, not heritage. They must be removed,\u201d Pelosi said in a letter to leaders of a congressional committee in charge of managing the statues in the Capitol.</p> <p>Under a longstanding tradition, each state sends two statues to the Capitol. Those commemorated include Lee and Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederacy.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Reuters reported that a \u201cFort Trump\u201d idea appeared to have fallen. The nation of Poland proposed in 2018 to name a military base in honor of Trump, in return for him placing a permanent presence there. But the plan has crumbled amid disputes over how to fund the deployment and where to garrison the soldiers, sources told the agency.</p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump has joined the calls for a ceasefire in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/libya\">Libya</a> amid concerns that Egypt would be willing to send ground troops into the country to prevent a rout of its ally Khalifa Haftar, the leader of forces in the east.</p> <p>Airstrikes and rocket attacks in the latest outbreak of violence killed 19 civilians between 5 and 8 June, including three women and five children, according to the UN. At least 12 civilians have been injured.</p> <p>As fighting continued, the UN said it was in close contact with military leaders on both sides in a bid to agree renewed terms for a ceasefire.</p> <p>In a further sign of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/from-idlib-to-tripoli-turkeys-grab-for-influence-in-libya\">growing international ramifications of the complex</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/26/from-idlib-to-tripoli-turkeys-grab-for-influence-in-libya\"> conflict</a>, a tense standoff between Greek and Turkish ships in the Mediterranean narrowly avoided boiling over into a conflict over Turkish efforts to supply arms to Libya\u2019s UN-recognised government.</p> <p>The standoff came as a Greek helicopter, operating under the aegis of a European Union operation to enforce a UN arms embargo, moved to interrupt a Turkish cargo ship bound for Libya.&nbsp;</p> <p>A&nbsp;Greek helicopter linked by the Greek frigate Spetsai approached the Turkish cargo ship, prompting a Turkish naval vessel to come to its defence. With the two sides squaring up, the Italian commander of the EU\u2019s Operation Irini&nbsp;&nbsp;ordered the Greek ship to back off. Irini\u2019s rules of engagement give it the power to inspect ships on the high seas and if necessary divert the ship.</p> <p>The episode highlights the risk in allowing Greece to take a prominent role in the EU\u2019s arms embargo enforcement since Greece is not seen by Turkey as a neutral party, but instead an opponent of the Turkish-GNA alliance that has swung the civil war away from Haftar over the last month.</p> <p>Greece has angrily rejected a Turkish claim to exclusive <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jul/11/turkey-rejects-claims-drilling-illegally-gas-off-cyprus\">drilling rights</a> in the Mediterranean, and formally asked for Turkish behaviour to be on the agenda of Monday\u2019s meeting of EU foreign affairs ministers.</p> <p>Greece signed a rival exclusive drilling agreement with Italy in the Ionian Sea on Tuesday, showing how the Libyan conflict has spilled into the wider Mediterranean.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s surprise intervention came in a phone call to the Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi.</p> <p>The Trump administration has been largely disengaged from Libya, but the&nbsp;lack of interest appears to have ended when the US military command in Africa warned that Russia, which supports Haftar, was pouring fighter planes into the country, and possibly seeking to establish a permanent airbase.</p> <p>Trump also spoke to the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, on Sunday. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, said: \u201cQuick and good-faith negotiations are now required to implement a ceasefire and relaunch the UN-led intra-Libyan political talks.\u201d&nbsp;The US is anxious to ensure that Cairo does not send its own troops over the border into Libya.<br><br>European diplomats are hoping that Haftar\u2019s military reverses will lead to resumption of political talks agreed in principle in Berlin in January, since Haftar\u2019s hopes of capturing Tripoli by force have been crushed.</p> <p>Some diplomats also hope Haftar\u2019s influence over the political process might be diminished. The German ambassador to Libya met Haftar on Wednesday, suggesting the unpredictable 76-year-old leader has not yet been dismissed by the EU as an interlocutor.<br></p>",

The laboratory moved quickly to retest on a second machine the swabs that it still held that had tested positive on the fast track analyser. This showed that it had reported some false positive results.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>The hospital is conducting a full investigation to understand what caused the problem.

But none of the three men said anything to suggest that the Ferguson assessment might be wrong. On Sunday, when another epidemiologist, <strong>Prof John Edmunds</strong>, made a very similar claim on the Andrew Marr show, <strong>Matt Hancock</strong>, the health secretary, was asked out right if he agreed <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/07062001.pdf\">and he said no. </a>Johnson may have decided that the claim is too plausible to dismiss outright. <strong>Whitty</strong> stressed that, at the time when decisions about the lockdown were being taken, they had \u201cvery limited information about this virus\u201d.</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jun/10/support-bubble-plan-lets-single-parents-in-england-combine-households\">Johnson announced that around 11 million people living alone or as single parents will be allowed to combine with another household to form a \u201csupport bubble\u201d in England.</a></strong></li> \n  </ul> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Johnson said the coronavirus pandemic had \u201ca long way to go\u201d.</strong> He said:</li> \n  </ul> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There are lots of things, lots of data, things that we still don\u2019t know, and this epidemic has a long way to go, alas.

So had we introduced lockdown measures a week earlier, we would have reduced the final death toll by at least a half.</p> \n   <p>Whilst I think the measures, given what we knew about this virus then, in terms of its transmission and its lethality, were warranted, I\u2019m second guessing at this point, certainly had we introduced them earlier we would have seen many fewer deaths. </p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n   <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"69889190-90d6-40f1-a768-cffabc2d8ce4\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n    <div>\n     <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SKNpCBBuVws?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n    </div>\n   </gu-atom> \n  </figure> \n  <p>Ferguson said he also agreed with <strong>Prof John Edmunds</strong>, another epidemic modelling specialist, based at the London School of Hygiene and Tropic Medicine. Edmunds sits on the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (as Ferguson did, until he had to resign in May), and on Sunday Ferguson <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/07062003.pdf\">told the Marr Show: </a></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>We should have gone into lockdown earlier. I think it would have been hard to do it, and I think the data that we were dealing with in the early part of March, and our current situational awareness was really quite poor. And so I think it would have been very hard to pull the trigger at that point, but I wish we had. I wish we had gone into lockdown earlier. I think that has cost a lot of lives unfortunately.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>After Edmunds made this claim on Sunday ministers hit back hard, and it is not hard to see why. The UK government introduced a full lockdown after most other European countries (see the chart below, from <a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/mrc-gida/2020-03-30-COVID19-Report-13.pdf\">this paper)</a> and it has been claimed that this was, at least in part, because Johnson had a strong, libertarian aversion to measures of this kind.

And then there are other days when it struggles hard to get much beyond the \u2018so what\u2019 territory. Today was closer to the latter category. Despite all talk of unease on the Tory benches (see <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jun/10/uk-coronavirus-live-news-latest-updates-furlough-pmqs-covid-19-latest?page=with:block-5ee0a35d8f0860ca20fa95f7#block-5ee0a35d8f0860ca20fa95f7\">10.17am)</a>, not a peep emerged. The Black Lives Matters protests did come up, but only in a relatively perfunctory manner. And the Boris Johnson/Keir Starmer exchanges - normally the highlight - were inconclusive. Neither was particularly good.</p> \n  <p>Starmer seems to view PMQs as a war of attrition; he shows no interest in flash, \u2018knockout blow\u2019 moments, preferring a steady stream that portray the opposition as measured and sensible, and Johnson as negligent. Mostly this has worked well, but it did not particularly today. He devoted his first two questions to asking why measures in reports weren\u2019t being implemented. But they are, claimed Johnson. This may be wishful thinking, but it was not contested by Starmer, and a viewer without prior knowledge may have been left wondering if Johnson had a point.</p> \n  <p>Starmer\u2019s best question was his third, about the death numbers. He was calm and factual, and his question - \u201cthere\u2019s no pride in these numbers, is there?\u201d - was unanswerable. Johnson\u2019s response was particularly poor. If No 10 really thinks it will be able to hold off addressing this issue for the rest of the year just by claiming it\u2019s too early to make international comparisons, it is likely to be disappointed.</p> \n  <p>Johnson\u2019s best moments came when Starmer asked about schools, and Johnson was able to accuse Labour of inconsistency - arguing for continued closures earlier, complaining about continued closures now. This is not wholly fair - Labour\u2019s argument is that a more consensual approach was needed to facilitate school opening - but defending a nuanced position is never straightforward, and by the standards of political sloganising rather than high-grade logic, Johnson\u2019s charge was true enough to stick. It was also interesting to see him use Starmer\u2019s profession against him. Generally commentators have taken the view the Starmer\u2019s lawyerly precision (we are not allowed call him \u201cforensic\u201d any more, the clich\u00e9 police have ruled) is a bonus, but Johnson now seems to running the line that, because Starmer is a barrister, he will just say whatever is convenient to his case.</p> \n  <p>Johnson actually had an announcement to make: a \u00a363m welfare programme for schools. But the way he raised it, it was hard to tell whether or not this was anything new. If this was supposed to give him good ammunition to use against Starmer, it did not work out.</p> \n  <p>The best question of the day was probably Kirsty Blackman\u2019s. (See<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/jun/10/uk-coronavirus-live-news-latest-updates-furlough-pmqs-covid-19-latest?page=with:block-5ee0c3858f08758335229663#block-5ee0c3858f08758335229663\"> 12.28pm.) </a>But even that did not generate a memorable answer.

Tory MPs believe cutting the 2-metre rule down to 1 meter is absolutely at the heart of the wider opening of the economy \u2026 One very senior Tory MP said to me: \u2018Our leadership is pitiful. Boris Johnson needs to be honest. Opening up the economy brings risks.

And saying \u2018defund the barber\u2019 doesn\u2019t mean no one\u2019s getting haircuts \u2014\u2013 although admittedly right now, no one\u2019s getting haircuts.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/jun/09/trevor-noah-protests-black-lives-matter-late-night\">Trevor Noah on those doubting the protests: 'They\u2019re going to be eating their words'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Meanwhile, Donald Trump\u2019s approval rating has dropped to 38%, according to the <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/08/politics/cnn-poll-trump-biden-chaotic-week/index.html\">latest CNN poll</a>, and the president is \u201cdesperate to turn things around\u201d, to the point where he\u2019s reportedly considered delivering a speech to the nation on race and unity. \u201cYes, they\u2019re <em>considering</em> it \u2013 a heroic <em>contemplation</em> of the <em>possibility </em>of leadership,\u201d said Colbert. \u201cIt reminds me of Dr King\u2019s immortal words: \u2018I\u2019m thinking about having a dream.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>While Trump contemplated, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden spoke up, delivering a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UK1Sskf7EE\">moving virtual eulogy for George Floyd</a> at a memorial service in Houston on Tuesday. \u201cYou see, President Trump? It\u2019s possible to bring people to tears at church without having to release pepper spray,\u201d Colbert said. \u201cAnd the Vice-President did the one thing that the President fears the most: Biden didn\u2019t mention the name Donald Trump once. Let\u2019s hope very soon, we can all do the same.\u201d</p> <h2>Trevor Noah</h2> <p>On the Daily Show, Trevor Noah parsed the differences between the response by congressional Democrats and Republicans to the Black Lives Matter protests across the nation. Earlier this week, Democrats led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi kneeled in honor of George Floyd wearing kente cloths, an indigenous Ghanaian fabric. \u201cI understand the symbolic gesture of kneeling to remember George Floyd. What I don\u2019t understand is needing to dress like extras from Coming to America 2,\u201d said Noah, adding the gesture \u201cfelt like they were trying too hard\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1270545450156908547\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Today in No, Not Like That: Team Trump brags about getting 8% of the Black vote while the Democrats dress like extras from Coming to America 2. <a href=\"https://t.co/OQqYGOk4zA\">pic.twitter.com/OQqYGOk4zA</a></p>&mdash; The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TheDailyShow/status/1270545450156908547?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">June 10, 2020</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>\u201cNow, to be fair, the Democrats weren\u2019t just kneeling and wearing kente cloth,\u201d he said. \u201cThey also unveiled police reform legislation that would make some pretty big changes,\u201d such as banning no-knock warrants in drug cases, which allowed police to enter into the home and kill Breonna Taylor in Louisville in April, and make chokeholds a civil rights violation. And it would make it easier to prosecute police who use excessive force, which is virtually impossible now. \u201cLike now, you need to catch them on video, then have a [District Attorney] that\u2019s willing to prosecute them, then have a jury that actually wants to hold cops accountable,\u201d Noah explained. \u201cThen, after all that, you still need to find the cops Horcrux and destroy it, otherwise they just get to go right back out on the force.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, Trump doubled down on his backing of police, telling reporters: \u201cI say 99.9, but let\u2019s go with 99% of [cops] are great, great people.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, 99% of all police are great people. And I guess it\u2019s just unlucky that protesters happen to keep meeting with the bad 1% over, and over, and over again,\u201d said Noah over recent images of police brutality against protesters.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not saying that all cops are bad. But the problems with the police are much more widespread than Trump is acknowledging,\u201d he continued. \u201cBecause every single time \u2013 every single time \u2013 a police department gets audited, or investigated, the results that come back time and time again show deep rot and systemic issues often from the top. It\u2019s like turning on a black light in a hotel room \u2013 there\u2019s no way you\u2019re only going to find one stain.\u201d</p> <h2>Jimmy Kimmel</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg7ASRLdsB0\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tg7ASRLdsB0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>And in Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel responded to reports that Trump has dismissed polls placing him behind Biden as false. \u201cIf you think he won\u2019t contest the election if he loses \u2013 he won\u2019t even accept the meaningless poll he\u2019s losing,\u201d Kimmel said. \u201cThey\u2019re going to have to drag him out of that White House by his heels.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt makes sense that Trump doesn\u2019t get it. He\u2019s like a lot of soft-brained 73-year-old men who watch nothing but Fox News,\u201d Kimmel continued, cutting to Tucker Carlson arguing on Fox News that America is not a racist country. \u201cRight, but didn\u2019t you want to build a wall to keep those immigrants out of \u2026 oh, nevermind. He\u2019s right! America\u2019s fine, we have no problems at all,\u201d Kimmel deadpanned. \u201cThose people marching in the streets? They\u2019re just getting exercise.\u201d</p> <p>Kimmel also touched on Trump\u2019s propagation of a conspiracy theory that Martin Gugino, the 75-year-old man in serious condition with a skull fracture after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/06/buffalo-officers-filmed-shoving-75-year-old-protester-charged-with-assault\">Buffalo police shoved him to the ground</a> during a protest last week, is an Antifa covert agent. \u201cJust to recap, the theory here is that a 75-year-old man was using his cell phone to scan police communication equipment in order to black it out,\u201d Kimmel explained. \u201cI think anyone who\u2019s tried to Zoom with their grandparents knows there\u2019s no possible way that\u2019s true. But our president?

In London, with the Notting Hill <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/07/notting-hill-carnival-2020-cancelled-coronavirus\">carnival cancelled</a>, its artistry and irreverent spirit lives on in the mini-soundsystems that have cropped up after marches and even within crowds. Where words won\u2019t suffice to express the anger and frustration of affected communities, songs give protest a language. This game-changing moment has inspired a new wave of protest songs and underlined the timelessness of others.&nbsp;</p> <h2>YG&nbsp;\u2013 FTP</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NFJtEqO0HU\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_NFJtEqO0HU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The possibilities of defunding or abolishing police forces are leading a lot of conversations at the moment.

Lingo\u2019s melodies, in straightforward and dulcet Kendrick-inspired tones, have charged up the protests taking place in London. The idyllic video set on a grey concrete estate sees Lingo weave between a white-robed choir wearing balaclavas and a solid body of men and women dressed in all black as he raps: \u201cBlack don\u2019t mean illegal, they don\u2019t know me / When the blues see red there\u2019s greyness.\u201d The track is a reminder of how insubstantial citizenship can be for black Britons, and of the violent treatment we often receive at the hands of the state.</p> <h2>Keedron Bryant \u2013 I Just Wanna Live&nbsp;</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIuSLBX74Ac\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UIuSLBX74Ac?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>The 12-year-old gospel singer who featured on US TV show Little Big Shots moved the world with a 50-second clip of himself singing this song written by his mother Johnetta Bryant.

And it\u2019s and there\u2019s a continuing pattern.</p> <p>There\u2019s a systemic pattern here which I appeal to the government, and this new system that the ministers believe is going to find the answers to it, this federation reform council, that this group of people actually look at the systemic approaches that take place where First Nations people are likely to come to the attention of police.</p> <p>We know that First Nations people who come to the attention of the police are likely to be arrested and charged. </p> <p>We know that First Nations people who come to the attention of the police will be charged but will also be sent to court. And when they go to court, what happens, they\u2019ll be sent to jail. Now this is a pattern. This is a paradigm, that systematic, it\u2019s systemic, it\u2019s institutionalised. </p> <p>And if you look at this, from a First Nations point of view, this is about the subjugation of the First Nations people. </p> <p>This is not about enlightened policy. This is about subjugating the First Nations people, you correlate that to the number of people who are being taken away, the number of kids, there will be 30,000 kids in their home care. </p> <p>And you\u2019ll come up with a \u2018it\u2019s going to take time. It\u2019s complicated. And you know, it\u2019s really difficult.\u2019</p> <p>Well, it\u2019s not. Address the underlying issues \u2013 health, housing, education, employment \u2013 and work with First Nations peoples through the Coag system, or through the new system of the reform council, whatever it is, to actually set some targets as senator Wong has said, around the scenes for incarceration rates, and for the diminishment of removing kids from custody, or being removed from their homes and put into custody of another family, which ultimately will lead to the adoption out of these kids. </p> <p>And I\u2019ll remind the government that the Bring Them Home report re-analyse the policies and practices that pertain to that, practices as heinous practices, bordered on genocide, bordered on genocide. </p> <p>So I agree, I asked you sincerely to make this a priority, a top priority for too long \u2013 nice words, good intentions, but the lack of action and commitment has not seen a reduction of deaths in custody. </p> <p>It\u2019s seen an escalation in the social indicators that diminish First Nations people and diminish us as a nation because we are incapable of dealing with it. </p> <p>So I ask the government to sincerely put the best intentions into its commitments, and enter in a real working commitment with the First Nations peoples, and get real agreements with the states, and stop pussyfooting around with the states, say, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s the state\u2019s responsibility\u2019. </p> <p>Well, we know this.

As I said before, racism has no place in Australia, and we condemn it and call it out wherever we can.</p> <p>And the type of division that we\u2019ve seen in the US has been distressing and the fact that you have circumstances where black communities feel that they cannot live in an environment of safety \u2013 the fact that equally you now have circumstances where police, most of whom in the United States would still be good, law-abiding citizens, feel that they are being vilified, is creating a terrible circumstance there and I hope the US can find a way to come together and more successfully address these issues, and I don\u2019t want to see that sort of division brought at all into the Australian political debate.</p> <p>... Well, look, as I say, I\u2019m not surprised, but I am saddened and disappointed. I wouldn\u2019t engage in that type of vilification. His record can speak for itself, but equally, more importantly now, as we look to the future, the acts surrounding his death, I think, speak to an injustice that needs to be addressed in terms of that incident by the US legal system, but more broadly, an injustice that, as we\u2019ve seen, tragically in the US, the rates of deaths around Covid-19 have been disproportionately borne in communities \u2013 often black American communities. </p> <p>Thankfully in Australia, we have a much fairer system, a universal healthcare system, we are able to tackle many of these issues \u2013 not to the point of perfection. The job is never done in terms of stamping out racism, or driving towards creating the best environment for equality and opportunity for individuals. </p> <p>We have to be ever-vigilant and keep working there. But I think we have been saying that our system, in all of those areas, holds up amongst the best in the world, and much better than some of the challenging circumstances we\u2019ve seen in the US.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-10T06:49:47.451Z\">at 7.49am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5ee07ea38f08beee219d88db\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/daniel-hurst\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-10T06:33:32.208Z\">7.33am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Australian year 12 students will receive their final results in the second half of December.</p> <p>A meeting of education ministers from across the country has decided the release of individual Australian Tertiary Admission Rank (Atar) results, for students completing year 12 in 2020, would occur \u201cwithin a nationally consistent window of 15 December to 31 December 2020\u201d.</p> <p>In a statement issued this afternoon, the group \u2013 known as the Education Council \u2013 said it recognised the challenges being year 12 students and their families were experiencing as the pandemic had disrupted their final year of schooling.</p> <p>It also \u201cacknowledged the seriousness of these concerns and agreed that year 12 students and their families must be supported and have reliable information to pursue their post-school pathways\u201d.</p> <p>A working group \u2013 which includes Universities Australia, the Australasian Curriculum, Assessment and Certification Authorities, and the Australasian Conference of Tertiary Admissions Centres \u2013 had advised students who wish to enter university in 2021 to \u201cwork hard and complete the Senior Secondary Certificate of Education\u201d.</p> <p>The Education Council also decided on a nationally consistent set of messages for all year 12 students to avoid any misunderstandings or confusion about the admissions processes for 2021. </p> <p>These key messages include:</p> <ul> <li>Current year 12 students will be able to complete a Senior Secondary Certificate of Education (SSCE) this year.

Universities have a range of entry pathways available every year for students.</li> <li>In 2021, universities will continue to use the Atar and existing alternative pathways alongside the Atar to facilitate access to university.

These are not things that can be done, Mr Speaker, in a rushed or ill-considered manner.</p> <p>The review is being undertaken in June. The review will make recommendations, I would imagine, to the government, as would be its purpose, and then the government would consider those recommendations. It would consider the fiscal implications of those recommendations and, Mr Speaker, it would take advice on that as cabinet\u2019s work. </p> <p>Now, I appreciate the member who asked the question has never served in a cabinet, Mr Speaker, let alone an expenditure review committee or had any sort of ministerial responsibility for working through such decisions of great importance.</p> <p>But he might be educated on this point. That when you make decisions of this gravity and this seriousness, Mr Speaker, in a situation like this, you are very careful about it.</p> <p>So as the government announced, we will make the decisions on the basis of the view that\u2019s been submitted by Treasury and that will be done in the third week or thereabouts of July, as is our anticipated timeframe, to provide that further economic statement that will take into account the review that is being done of the jobkeeper program. </p> <p>Now, that is the proper, responsible way to manage important financial decisions.

The park was finally brutally cleared two months later.</p> <p>Nobody could doubt the success of Occupy in changing the nature of the national political and social debate. It put concepts of income inequality, of the \u201c1%\u201d, firmly and permanently on the map.</p> <p>But once the protest had been broken up, its resolutely anti-hierarchical nature, combined with the distrust of many of its activists towards institutions and infrastructure, meant that it had nowhere else to go. It dissipated into the downtown Manhattan air.</p> <p>\u201cOccupy was also a tactic, not a strategy, and one that could not continue,\u201d Chomsky said. \u201cIt had an impact: focusing on extreme inequality that is poisoning the society under the neoliberal regime.

Though she agrees that Occupy didn\u2019t directly change America \u2013 income inequality in the US has <a href=\"http://apps.urban.org/features/wealth-inequality-charts/index.html\">increased steadily</a> every year since 2011 \u2013 it did spawn a number of powerful campaigns to long-term effect.</p> <p>She points to the fight for a higher minimum wage and union representation for fast-food workers.

Her recent book, American Resistance, tracked the impact of the 2017 Women\u2019s March held the day after Trump\u2019s inauguration.</p> <p>Studying the data, she found that much of the energy released on that day \u2013 the largest day of protest in American history \u2013 was channeled back into local communities and their congressional races. The result was that Democrats took back the House in 2018 in the so-called \u201cBlue Wave\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f5f9f866080bef5f581db2130c353c81dd2deb06\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5f9f866080bef5f581db2130c353c81dd2deb06/0_103_3075_1845/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Black Lives Matter\u2019 is painted on the pavement of 16th Street near the White House.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Black Lives Matter\u2019 is painted on the pavement of 16th Street near the White House.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlos Vilas Delgado/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She sees a repeat of that potential today. \u201cWe are seeing amazing opportunities for people to channel what\u2019s going on in the streets into political activism, especially with such a crucial election looming.\u201d</p> <p>The question remains, though, is there a need for some structured vehicle that could absorb the positive radiation of the current protests without which the movement risks fragmenting and dissipating just like Occupy? Fisher thinks there is.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m sure it will be unpopular to say this, but I think there is a need for some professionalized organizational ecosystem to support this movement. There is a void forming, and we need to fill it.\u201d</p> <p>Noam Chomsky also sees a need for greater strategic direction. He wonders whether popular movements will emerge \u201cthat seek to deal with the brutal legacy of 400 years of vicious racism, that extends far beyond police violence\u201d.</p> <p>Nelini Stamp is resolutely optimistic. She reminds us that Black Lives Matter was founded in 2013, took off the following year during the Ferguson, Missouri, protests over the police killing of Michael Brown, and has been beavering away at effecting change ever since.</p> <p>\u201cThere has been a movement for black lives over the past six years that has never stopped. We have more infrastructure now for people to land and go places than we did then \u2013 we\u2019ve built more muscle.\u201d</p> <p>Is she not anxious that the euphoria of the current protests could fade over time into disappointment?</p> <p>\u201cI mean, I\u2019m always anxious about that,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve never seen a multiracial uprising in my life like we\u2019re seeing right now, and for all the anxiety I have every morning about what happens next, that gives me hope.\u201d&nbsp;</p>",
  "<p>The morning after Donald Trump\u2019s election in November 2016, a Conservative minister bounded up to me in Westminster\u2019s New Palace Yard to share one of the worst political predictions I have ever heard: \u201cIt\u2019ll be fine,\u201d he said with triumph. \u201cYou\u2019ll see.

Many will deny that they supported him and some will even believe that. Shame drives out awkward memories and scrubs consciences clean.</p> <p>That is trickier for those who put their enthusiasm on the record. None outdid Michael Gove, comparing Trump to George Washington. The first president had also been misunderstood by Britain, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/15/michael-gove-uk-interview-tory-times\">Gove wrote</a> in an unctuous interview with the 45th. He cast Trump as a \u201cforce of nature\u201d who did not merit the \u201cscorn and condescension\u201d of his UK critics.&nbsp;To compensate for his countrymen\u2019s discourtesy, Gove posed with his subject, grinning and giving the thumbs-up.</p> <p>In the gallery of cringing subservience that image can hang alongside Theresa May <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2017/jan/27/trump-may-hold-hands-white-house-video\">holding the president\u2019s hand</a> during her first visit to the White House. Later that day, Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/jan/28/trump-immigration-ban-syria-muslims-reaction-lawsuits\">issued executive order 13769</a> \u2013 the entry ban on nationals from predominantly Muslim countries. May did not condemn it.</p> <p>Some said there was a better man behind the mask, but there was no mask. The racist snarl, the bully\u2019s sneer and the infantile pout were all his. The face of the campaign was true to the character of the candidate. The only way to see a nobler Trump was to mould one from delusion, cowardice and self-interest \u2013 plentiful resources in a government embarking on Brexit.</p> <p>Those who found Trump\u2019s appeals to white nationalism a little vulgar retreated to arguments based on realpolitik. The transatlantic relationship is bigger than personalities, they said. We honour the office of president, regardless of who sits there. That diplomatic rationale led Britain to roll out what Jacob Rees-Mogg boasted should be \u201c<a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/donald-trump-uk-visit-jacob-reesmogg-address-parliament-a8337946.html\">the reddest of red carpets</a>\u201d for a state visit.</p> <p>The problem is that Trump is a malignancy eating away at the authority of his office. He has no concept of alliances based on mutual interest. Like any despot, he demands submission, then despises as weaklings those who submit. Britain\u2019s loyalty should be to the institutions of liberal democracy in the US and around the world that Trump attacks.</p> <p>Angela Merkel got the tone right. The <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/11/09/angela-merkel-congratulates-donald-trump-kind-of/\">German </a><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/11/09/angela-merkel-congratulates-donald-trump-kind-of/\">chancellor\u2019s message</a> marking Trump\u2019s victory was more&nbsp;rebuke&nbsp;than congratulation. She itemised the ethical foundations of partnership between democracies, \u201cthe rule of law and the dignity of each and every person, regardless of their origin, skin colour, creed, gender, sexual orientation, or political views\u201d. She offered cooperation \u201cbased on these values\u201d.</p> <p>Back in Westminster, giddy Brexiteers scoffed at Merkel\u2019s piety, which they took as a symptom of strategic decline. New power alignments were coming into focus, the old order was unravelling and Berlin was disadvantaged by its lack of a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with the US. Forget Brussels, London had Washington on its side.</p> <p>The chancellor\u2019s critics underestimated her own capacity for hard-headed realpolitik. She identifies Germany\u2019s interests with the European Union as part of the broad apparatus of international rules-based cooperation. When Trump hurls aggressive rhetoric at those structures, when he calls the EU a \u201cfoe\u201d, when he lavishes praise on authoritarian rulers, Merkel listens. She does not gamble on apologist interpretations of what he really meant to say.<br><br>There is a certain type of squeamish Trump fellow-traveller who, embarrassed by displays of actual fascism, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/oct/31/peter-thiel-defends-donald-trump-muslim-ban-mexico-wall\">draws a distinction</a> between taking the president&nbsp;<em>literally</em>&nbsp;and taking him&nbsp;<em>seriously</em>. It is a clever formula, usually attributed to the libertarian tech billionaire Peter Thiel, but probably not coined by him. This rhetorical device is used to exonerate people who rally to hateful language on the grounds that they are responding to some deeper meaning. The thuggish misogyny and racist provocations are just short-cuts, like icons on a desktop leading to a more sophisticated program. By a feat of moral gymnastics, the nastiness could then be justified as empathic rage, expressing the legitimate concerns of humble Americans, traduced by metropolitan globalists.<br><br>But Trump despises the people who elected him. His economic policy transfers their money into the pockets of his family and friends. He befouled American public administration, leaving the country <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/01/donald-trump-coronavirus-boris-johnson-failures-president\">defenceless</a> against Covid-19. It is the stuff of banal kleptocracy, but a vanguard of ideologues and broadsheet media outriders dressed it up to seem complex, profound and somehow historically inevitable.<br><br>The narrative of popular grievance seeded the liberal calamity with guilt \u2013 a burden of self-criticism placed on the losers for neglecting the terrain where Trumpism flourished. A necessary stage, perhaps, to understand electoral forces in play, but then what? The ultimate task was still resisting a tyrant.<br><br>And what did the Tory party do, meanwhile, but jostle among the sycophants and courtiers seeking favours, kidding themselves that they had influence. They shredded European alliances to make confetti for a venal egomaniac\u2019s parade, cheered by the world\u2019s autocrats who knew the grotesque carnival route led away from law and order.&nbsp;</p> <p>And what is the reward for Britain? If Trump is defeated in November, the last four years are nothing but a stain on transatlantic relations. If Trump stays, the only global role for Boris Johnson is dishevelled sidekick to a rogue superpower. Either way there is a price to pay for collusion. History will record that Britain was no mere bystander at America\u2019s tragedy, nor was it innocent.</p> <p>\u2022 Rafael Behr is a Guardian columnist</p>",

Here are a few ideas for what you can do to join the fight:</em></p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <ul> \n   <ul> \n    <li><em>Demilitarize the police. Decrease law enforcement budgets and reinvest those resources to fund schools, libraries, quality healthcare, parks, childcare, jobs, interventionists and a youth development system. Community safety does not come from cops \u2013 strong institutions ensure communities can thrive.</em></li> \n    <li><em>Support organizations led by, serving and in service to Black people. Support those who organize, agitate, resist, disrupt, demonstrate and advocate to ensure that Black lives are not expendable. The people have the power \u2013 fund organized action.</em></li> \n    <li><em>Interrogate what being an ally truly means. Use your voice. Be bold and take a stand: equivocation fuels inequity. If you have privilege, use it, leverage it. There is nothing revolutionary about recognizing your power and doing nothing with it to advance social change and end systemic racism.</em></li> \n    <li><em>You are either for Black lives or you are not. Systemic racism permeates every system \u2013 law enforcement, education, health, transportation, housing, the economy, the environment and even philanthropy, the system in which I work. Are you hiring Black people? Are they tokenized or in leadership positions? It\u2019s not complicated. Oppression is operational. Disassemble it and undo the status quo.</em></li> \n    <li><em>Stop tiptoeing around race, slavery, racial injustice, racial bias, systemic racism, white supremacy, nationalism, anti-Blackness or racial equity. It\u2019s real. We\u2019ve studied and debated it long enough. Act. End of discussion.</em></li> \n    <li><em>Vote for an agenda at the local, state and federal levels that prioritizes Black lives and demolishes the insidious pillars of white supremacy in every form. For those whose electoral existence is predicated upon the domination of Black lives, we must dominate the ballot box. If you are registered to vote and someone you know is not, help them register.

Thousands have attended his memorials in the last few days, and today there will be a final family ceremony in Houston to say farewell to the 46 year old whose death at the hands of the police on 25 May has sparked a global wave of grief and protest.</p> \n  <p>Here are some of the key stories and developments from yesterday and overnight:</p> \n  <ul> \n   <li><strong>Congressional Democrats unveiled their police reform bill. </strong>It would ban chokeholds but many criminal justice activists have said reforms do not go far enough</li> \n   <li><strong>Economists say the US entered a recession in February</strong> as businesses started to close down in response to coronavirus</li> \n   <li><strong>New Coronavirus cases are accelerating again</strong> in more than a dozen US states</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>The president\u2019s diary is empty for today, save a meeting with secretary of state <strong>Mike Pompeo</strong> this afternoon. His diary wasn\u2019t empty yesterday though. In a bit of symbolism that couldn\u2019t be stronger, <strong>Joe Biden</strong> met privately with members of George Floyd\u2019s family in Houston. <strong>Donald Trump</strong> met with police.</p> \n  <p>I\u2019m Martin Belam, and I\u2019ll be live blogging more reaction to the Black Lives Matter movement protests and US political developments for a couple of hours until my colleagues in New York pick up the baton.
