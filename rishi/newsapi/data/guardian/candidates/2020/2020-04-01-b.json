  "<p>In the early 2000s, the most popular queer characters on TV were Jack McFarland and Will Truman of the sitcom Will &amp; Grace. Will and Jack were so beloved, Vice-President Joe Biden once theorized the show had <a href=\"https://www.thewrap.com/will-grace-real-life-political-impact-marriage-equality/\">played a major role in shifting views on marriage equality</a>. The characters were also the start of a trope that would prevail on TV for years: the cosmopolitan gay male. The image would live on in shows such as Queer as Folk, Looking, and the reality competitions Project Runway and America\u2019s Next Top Model. Who could imagine that 20 years on, a mullet-wearing, gay, polyamorous exotic animal owner from rural Oklahoma would become TV\u2019s biggest talked about gay star?</p> <p>Joe Exotic, the eccentric subject of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/20/tiger-king-joe-exotic-netflix-series\">Netflix docu-series Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness</a>, has amassed a fervent following in the short time since the show\u2019s premiere on Friday. The rapper Cardi B <a href=\"https://people.com/music/cardi-b-start-gofundme-tiger-king-joe-exotic/\">live-tweeted</a> her reactions and expressed a desire to start a GoFundMe campaign for Mr Exotic, whose full name Wikipedia gives as Joseph Allen Maldonado-Passage (n\u00e9 Schreibvogel). Fans have taken to dressing up as Joe, slapping on fake handlebar mustaches and blond mullet wigs. And actors such as Dax Shepard and Jared Leto are pitching themselves to play the gun-loving zookeeper in a <a href=\"https://nypost.com/2020/03/30/celeb-tiger-king-fans-fighting-over-roles-in-future-movie/\">forthcoming scripted miniseries</a>. Amid the anxiety of the coronavirus pandemic, we are finding humor and relief in an imperfect, self-described \u201credneck\u201d queer who owns more than 200 tigers. He\u2019s the furthest cry from the affable, anodyne queer men who typically win America over, such as Cam and Mitchell of Modern Family and the \u201cgay best friend\u201d cast of Queer Eye. But unlikely times call for an unlikely hero.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s possible people need a really flawed person to humanize right now,\u201d says Matt Brim, professor and author of Poor Queer Studies. Brim says the love for Joe might be more complicated than it immediately appears to be. \u201cWhat is the calculus here? For some viewers, Joe Exotic\u2019s rural white queer class identity may be his flaw, so that looking past or accepting it signals tolerance, that most passive-aggressive of power plays. For other viewers, those same qualities \u2013 in their specific and unwieldy combination \u2013 may represent the very soup of our common dilemma. One thing\u2019s for sure: we\u2019re not in South Bend any more,\u201d he said, referring to the city where the former Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg was mayor.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/shortcuts/2020/apr/01/like-pouring-tequila-on-your-brain-why-tiger-king-is-the-most-watched-show-on-netflix\">Like pouring tequila on your brain: why Tiger King is the most-watched show on Netflix</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Joe belongs to a rural, Republican-voting, working-class background, which makes for great TV for those who have a superficial understanding of the south. Joe appears to be keenly aware of this fact, playing into the shock value of his queer, southern life. Before Tiger King, he pitched multiple reality shows about his life to networks and starred in country music videos with his husbands. He is the perfect kind of reality star \u2013 straddling the line between an unrestrained \u201cbig\u201d personality and a caricature.</p> <p>Joe\u2019s queerness and southern-ness intersect in distinct, complex ways. This includes his use of meth, a popular gay recreational drug. (In 2018, Oklahoma, site of Joe\u2019s zoo, was listed as having one of the highest <a href=\"https://www.therecoveryvillage.com/meth-addiction/meth-capital/#gref\">rates of meth use</a> in the US.) He goes out of his way to associate with traditional ideas of masculinity through his love for guns, collection of large, aggressive animals, and pursuit of young, butch men who have previous histories of only dating women.</p> <p>In the show, Joe says he fell in love with tigers while recovering from a suicide attempt he linked to his parents\u2019 homophobia. Did Joe decide the best way to reconcile his queerness with his surroundings was to assimilate in the most extreme ways \u2013 leaning into the love for hunting and control over wildlife that dominates southern culture? Then he cultivated this assimilation and it grew into a profitable persona. Joe made it so that the most outrageous thing about him in Oklahoma was neither his queerness or poly relationships. It was his tigers.</p> <p>Despite his progressive lifestyle, Joe himself is not a progressive. He believes in unregulated gun rights and, during his bizarre, far-fetched run for governor of Oklahoma, positioned himself as a libertarian. A viral video shows him pondering why black people can say the N-word but white people can\u2019t. However, his queerness complicates this otherwise predictable ideology. At his wedding, we see Joe and his two husbands dressed in fuschia western shirts \u2013 none of the elements feel coherent or like they belong together. Since its legalization in 2015, same-sex marriage no longer possesses the same air of radicalism and defiance. But a <em>polyamorous </em>one? Even the progressives in Brooklyn might bat a lash at that.</p> <p>In Tiger King, Joe presents a less than perfect view of himself \u2013 from his meth use to nasty spats with co-workers to his tragic, failed marriages to allegedly straight men. But, in many ways, Joe\u2019s imperfections (and criminal convictions) are what make him feel like a breakthrough for queer representation. Because \u201cperfect\u201d is so 1998.</p> <p>However, there is the danger we are collectively laughing<em> at </em>Joe and his rural background, instead of laughing <em>with</em> him.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2020/mar/20/tiger-king-joe-exotic-netflix-series\">Murder, madness and tigers: behind the year's wildest Netflix series</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In a post, the runner of the popular Instagram account QueerAppalachia expressed concerns over Joe\u2019s popularity, writing: \u201cI\u2019ve spent a lot of time thinking about why Joe is a joke to everyone, even to the folks that understand the nuanced history &amp; economics that brought him into existence as a rural queer\u2026 [Joe Exotic] is more than just another <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/hillbillyjoke/\">#hillbillyjoke</a>, so much of his story is about class &amp; access.\u201d</p> <p>Representation of queerness in red states has always been sparse and complicated. The portrayals often face accusations of being exploitative or overly simplistic. A recent one was John B McLemore of the hit podcast series S-Town. McLemore was a queer horologist living in Woodstock, Alabama, a small, conservative place he hated. Critics called the podcast \u201cvoyeuristic\u201d and irresponsible for outing McLemore after his death. Netflix\u2019s Queer Eye occasionally chooses LGBTQ+ subjects living in conservative locales for its transformations, and the show\u2019s format \u2013 \u201cfix all your problems in an hour\u201d with a group of affluent, pro-consumption coastal gay men \u2013 has drawn scrutiny.</p> <p>Does the novelty of a complicated figure such as Joe Exotic expose our preferences for coastal queer narratives? \u201cYes,\u201d says John Howard, professor and author of Men Like That: A Southern Queer History. \u201cFor 25 years, scholars have criticized a bicoastal bias in US queer history that has focused attention on east and west coast metropolitan areas. But this is changing.\u201d Howard points to the conversations Tiger King is producing. \u201cLet\u2019s hope the public debate expands. Perhaps we\u2019ll learn more about working-class queers and trans people of color who, as yet, remain at the margins of Joe\u2019s narrative.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <em>In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.org\">jo@samaritans.org</a> or <a href=\"mailto:jo@samaritans.ie\">jo@samaritans.ie</a>.

  "<p>\u201cDo you know what day it is?\u201d asked the man as we sat in the black Mercedes-Benz that had whisked me from the foreign student dormitory at Kim Il-sung university, where I had been living in the North Korean capital Pyongyang. I knew full well, but he answered his own question: \u201cIt\u2019s the day the US imperialists invaded and started the war.\u201d</p> <p>It was Tuesday 25 June, and the start of my <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2019/jun/27/australian-student-alek-sigley-reportedly-arrested-in-north-korea\">nine long days of interrogation</a> at the hands of the North Korean ministry of state security \u2013 or at least that\u2019s who I believed it was, as they never revealed who they actually were.</p> <h2>Blindfolds, no clocks and interrogation by \u2018teacher\u2019</h2> <p>That morning a gruff stranger had approached me in the internet room of the dormitory. I was in the third semester of my master\u2019s degree in Korean literature and was finishing off my homework about a North Korean short story ahead of an afternoon class.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re attending a meeting at university, come with me right now,\u201d the man said. Something was off, he had an overbearing manner and latent aggression in his expression.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1e458565f345ee2fde8f0c0355ad1756b7ab3da0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e458565f345ee2fde8f0c0355ad1756b7ab3da0/0_140_2200_1320/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kim Il-Sung University\u2019s Foreign Student Dormitory, North Korea.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kim Il-sung university\u2019s foreign student dormitory, North Korea.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alek Sigley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We sometimes had meetings on campus before, but I had an ominous feeling this one would be different.</p> <p>As I followed the man and his companion out of the front door and turned the corner to the parking lot at the side, I saw the black Mercedes-Benz, which had a black plastic bag covering its licence plate.</p> <p>\u201cFuck, you\u2019re in deep shit now,\u201d I thought to myself.</p> <p>I was ushered into the middle back seat, the man and his colleague sitting on either side. Very quickly they were replaced, as if choreographed, by two much larger men \u2013 with the man who had asked that first question of me seated in the front passenger seat. This man, who I knew only by the appellation of \u201cteacher\u201d (<em>sonsaengnim</em>), would be my lead interrogator.</p> <p>I had been quite enjoying my time at the university. The interrogation, on the other hand, was not much fun. I spent nine days in a room completely cut off from the outside world. There was no clock, and I had to sleep with the light on.</p> <p>On that first day they chose to give me a warm welcome, blindfolding me in the car as they read out a long list of crimes I had supposedly committed against the North Korean state. Upon arrival at the interrogation facility, I was escorted in by two guards, who made use of the opportunity to trip me up on the stairs at the entrance. After arriving at what would be my domicile and \u201cworkplace\u201d for the next week, a man (who thankfully made only that one brief appearance) with a crazed expression and bulging, bloodshot eyes started screaming at me at the top of his lungs.</p> <p>\u201cDo you wanna die you fucking bastard? You son of a bitch \u2026 Coming into our country and committing all these crimes. You think Trump or Pompeo will save your sorry arse? Huh?\u201d</p> <p>They asked me why I had come to their country. When I told them the truth \u2013 that I had a genuine interest in North Korean novels and wanted to do business there \u2013 I was told that it was \u201cunnatural\u201d that an Australian would harbour such motives, and that nobody would believe such logic. Their point was clear, we were the \u201cenemy\u201d.</p> <h2>\u2018Crimes\u2019, confessions and self-criticism</h2> <p>Every day was spent writing forced confessions of my \u201ccrimes\u201d, which became only more fanciful as time went on. When I objected to their allegations, they began yelling at me, reminding me that I could face execution by firing squad if I didn\u2019t carry out my \u201creflection\u201d and do it \u201csincerely\u201d. The entire process was in my third foreign language, Korean.</p> <p>A typical \u201cself-criticism\u201d session went like this:</p> <p>\u201cAlek, you do realise that this is serious business, don\u2019t you? If you\u2019re lucky, you\u2019ll only get 10 years hard labour. We have a mountain of evidence on your crimes. You\u2019d better confess if you\u2019d like to be treated leniently.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI have no idea what you\u2019re talking about. Honestly.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll right, let me show you an example.\u201d</p> <p>He pulls out a picture of a North Korean toy tank with an anti-American slogan inscribed on it that I had uploaded onto <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/aleksigley/?igshid=55nvn5xxdlbz&amp;hl=en\">Instagram</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a5dc235ac9a1aaf1a41a7d2a349a3d63a6e3c15f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a5dc235ac9a1aaf1a41a7d2a349a3d63a6e3c15f/0_0_2200_1320/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The offending Instagram post\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The offending Instagram post.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alek Sigley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cYou uploaded a photo of this toy tank onto the internet \u2026 That\u2019s <em>military espionage</em>!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIs he being serious?\u201d I thought to myself as I tried to suppress a smile.</p> <p>When they finally released me, they made me read out a \u201cletter of apology\u201d (which they dictated to me), in which I confessed to \u201cthreatening world peace\u201d, \u201cinfringing upon the sovereignty of the DPRK\u201d, among other heinous acts. I was also forced to acknowledge that my human rights had been respected, an act which itself was a violation of those very rights.</p> <p>They filmed this, threatening to release the footage if I ever \u201cslandered\u201d their country again. That, I actually wouldn\u2019t mind, other than for the fact that in the video I look a bit nervous. I was asked to sound \u201cmournful\u201d but I am a horrible actor and ended up reading the letter in monotone.</p> <h2>A stranger in one of the world\u2019s most xenophobic societies</h2> <p>I always knew that North Korea was that kind of a country, and that I was taking certain risks with what I was doing there. So in the end, I wasn\u2019t caught by surprise when I was detained, although I was caught a little off guard.</p> <p>Perhaps I found it hard to accept that this could ever happen to me, because over the years I had visited the Democratic People\u2019s Republic of Korea, as it is formally known, I had come to associate the place with the good people I met and came to know. Reservations about North Korea\u2019s political system aside, I had come to discover that most North Korean people were decent, honest, hard-working folk just like anywhere else.</p> <p>At the university dormitory I lived alongside the specially trained and vetted local students, who were ostensibly there to teach us the Korean language and culture but in reality were spying on us. They were the only Korean students we were allowed to interact with.</p> <p>North Korea is one of the world\u2019s most xenophobic societies. I\u2019ve never heard of a single foreigner visiting the home of a North Korean friend, even among the Chinese students. It simply has never been allowed.</p> <p>But this xenophobia comes from the state, not the people. </p> <p>One day, one of the Chinese students in the dormitory was playing a hip hop track on her phone. A Korean student curled her lip in disgust and said \u201chip hop is degenerate music\u201d. But another one of the Korean students visited me before he was due to leave the dormitory. \u201cYou\u2019re always listening to music Alek, can you play some of it for me?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"628dce7db44e3183798fc4435da889cad213ece3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/628dce7db44e3183798fc4435da889cad213ece3/0_0_1000_750/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alek Sigley at Kim Il-Sung university in Pyongyang\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alek Sigley at Kim Il-sung university in Pyongyang</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alek Sigley/Tongil Tours</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I always used earphones not only because I didn\u2019t want to disturb them, but also because I didn\u2019t want to create any political trouble. But I accepted his request, and played him some tracks from the Californian virtuoso rock guitarist Buckethead, a favourite of mine.</p> <p>\u201cI can feel the <em>han</em>,\u201d he said, evoking a very Korean sentiment with no English equivalent that is variously translated as resentment, grief, or sorrow. <em>Han </em>is often said to express the bitterness of the Korean people towards their history of suffering under Japanese colonialism. It is considered uniquely beautiful when rendered in music.</p> <p>\u201cIf I practise, will I ever be able to become as good at guitar as he?\u201d</p> <p>I said yes, but in my heart I knew that while this country is kept in a state of hermetic isolation \u2013 a place where rock music and hip hop don\u2019t officially exist \u2013 that might be unlikely.</p> <p>And that\u2019s the \u201clesson\u201d I learned in all this, if there is one. The government, ruled as it is by military hardliners and a perpetually suspicious security force, may hate us for a long time to come. But, after 20 visits over a decade, I know that the people of North Korea want more openness and more engagement with the outside world.</p> <h2>\u2018Say good things about our country\u2019</h2> <p>As soon as I had read out the apology and been forgiven for my \u201ccrimes\u201d, a switch flipped inside \u201cteacher\u201d. We chatted about sport \u2013 he played in a soccer team \u2013 and family life \u2013 he had great expectations for his 11-year-old son. I told him of my undying affection for my wife.</p> <p>And when the investigation was officially over, he began acting like a normal human being, patting me on the back and making jokes. Call it Stockholm Syndrome, but I actually quite liked this man. The next day I was driven to the airport, accompanied by him and a few of his colleagues. This last ride was spent comparing the cost of rent in Australia and Japan, and talking about my plans for the future.</p> <p>\u201cAlek, you have a knack for writing, you should keep on doing it. Just make sure you say good things about our country in your future work and maybe we can meet again in Pyongyang one day.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll do my best,\u201d I said.</p> <p>When the others had left the car to sort out some procedures in the airport, I sat in the carpark alone with teacher. In the next half hour, I would board a flight to Beijing and be free.</p> <p>\u201cAlek, please remember for future\u2019s sake \u2013 we don\u2019t hate you personally, it\u2019s the crimes you\u2019ve committed that we despise.\u201d</p> <p>I remained silent, but I wanted to say that right back at him.</p> <p><em>* Alek Sigley is working on a book-length account of his three semesters as a foreign student at Kim Il-sung university and his nine days of North Korean secret police interrogation.</em></p> <p><em>**Names and details of all North Koreans have been altered to protect their identities.</em></p> <p><br><br></p> <p><br><br></p>",

Are you going to endorse, or is this something you\u2019re considering to wait on?\u201d</p> <p>Warren dodged again: \u201cYou know, again, I really want to say that, right now, it\u2019s less about the politics and much more about the crisis that our country is in, and I think that\u2019s really where our focus has got to be at this moment,\u201d she replied. \u201cSo that\u2019s where I\u2019m keeping my attention right now. We don\u2019t get to do any political rallies at this moment anyway.\u201d</p> <p>Warren also praised Kate McKinnon\u2019s impersonation of her on Saturday Night Live (\u201cShe\u2019s such an incredibly talented comedian\u201d), recalled how she once was mistaken for McKinnon in a grocery store, and confirmed a rumor that she fought between dress rehearsal and the live show to keep several lines in her scene. \u201cI can tell you, having worked there and having been a writer on the show,\u201d said Meyers, \u201cthe writers who wrote those lines, the fact that you fought for them \u2013 they will be fans of yours forever.\u201d</p> <h2>Jimmy Kimmel</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnMHmNqhGxo\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YnMHmNqhGxo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>In Los Angeles, Jimmy Kimmel recapped Trump\u2019s frequent touching of the communal White House microphone at his press briefings. \u201cWe just witnessed a battle between ignorance and germaphobia,\u201d he said of one clip, \u201cand germaphobia got knocked out cold.\u201d</p> <p>Tuesday was the first day of work for Trump\u2019s new chief of staff, Mark Meadows, a former North Carolina congressman who\u2019s \u201cone of Trump\u2019s most enthusiastic suck-ups\u201d, said Kimmel. \u201cIn fact, the only reason he agreed to take the job of chief of staff is because he found out first lady was taken already.</p> <p>\u201cCan you think of any worse first day of work than in the Trump administration in the middle of a pandemic?\u201d Kimmel wondered. \u201cI would rather be the assistant manager at Popeye\u2019s the day those chicken sandwiches came out.\u201d</p> <p>And finally, ABC announced that it has cancelled the Bachelor Summer Games. \u201cThis suddenly just got real for me,\u201d said Kimmel. \u201cI guess they had no choice, but the truth is, corona is only the third most dangerous virus lurking in the Bachelor hot tub.\u201d<br></p>",
  "<p>The Polish government intends to hold a presidential election in May, despite a growing chorus of voices saying that doing so amid a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">pandemic</a> would be unfair, undemocratic and potentially dangerous.</p> <p>Based on current polling, current president Andrzej Duda, an ally of the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party, would be likely to gain more than 50% of the vote and thus win a second term in office without requiring a second round of voting.</p> <p>Incumbent politicians around the globe are receiving a boost in the polls during the uncertainty of coronavirus, as people seek stability during the crisis.

The rightwing PiS narrowly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/oct/14/poland-populist-law-and-justice-party-increases-majority\">won a general election last autumn</a>, but lost control of the upper house of parliament.

In a late-night amendment to a parliamentary bill over the weekend, the government introduced a rule that senior citizens or those in quarantine could submit postal votes. Another amendment could soon be under consideration that would allow the entire public to vote by post.</p> <p>On Saturday, more than 40 NGOs called on the prime minister to introduce a state of natural disaster and postpone the vote. If the vote went ahead, \u201cthe election result would very likely not reflect the real preferences of voters, and the president\u2019s legitimacy to hold office in such conditions would be extremely weak\u201d, said the appeal. More than 500 doctors and medical professors have also signed an appeal calling on the vote to be postponed on the grounds that it would cause a health risk for those taking part.</p> <p>On Sunday, the candidate from the centre-right Civic Platform party, Ma\u0142gorzata Kidawa-B\u0142o\u0144ska, said that if the vote went ahead, the government would be responsible for any citizens who fell ill, and said she was suspending her campaign. Other candidates have not followed suit, but with public appearances or rallies impossible due to coronavirus, and political campaigning and point-scoring irresponsible during an epidemic, it is hard to see how any vote could be fair.</p> <p>Duda himself has hinted that the election could yet be moved: \u201cIf it did happen that the epidemic was raging \u2026 then in that situation, the election date could turn out to be unsustainable, but I am counting on it that we will be able to calmly hold these elections,\u201d he told state-run television over the weekend.</p> <p>As coronavirus wreaks havoc with the fabric of everyday life across the globe, a number of governments are wrestling with dilemmas of whether or not to go ahead with elections. On 15 March, both <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/15/french-urged-to-vote-in-local-elections-amid-coronavirus-lockdown\">France</a> and Germany\u2019s Bavaria held local elections amid much criticism, with many believing the vote contributed to the spread of the virus. The second round of French elections, scheduled for 22 March, was cancelled.</p> <p>A number of upcoming votes have been postponed due to coronavirus, including a presidential election in Bolivia scheduled for May and an Ethiopian general election in August. However, South Korea will push ahead with a general election planned for 15 April, promising that all 14,000 polling stations will be disinfected and equipped with hand sanitiser, and that patients with coronavirus can vote from hospital.</p>",

  "<p>The Labour peer and former MP Ted Graham, Lord Graham of Edmonton, who has died aged 94, was one of the foremost figures in the British co-operative movement in the second half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. He owed his own advancement to the movement, which he had joined as an errand boy at Newcastle upon Tyne Co-operative, delivering groceries on a Co-op bike after leaving school at 14. Raised in prewar poverty in the Scotswood Road area of the city, he had passed the 11-plus but his family could not afford for him to attend grammar school.</p> <p>His lifetime journey to become the Labour party\u2019s chief whip in the House of Lords (1990-97) and to many of the major offices of the co-operative movement was one he never forgot. He was a kindly, popular man without a trace of self-importance. \u201cMy name is Ted Graham,\u201d he would say at public meetings, \u201cbut you can call me Lord.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/14/letter-lord-graham-of-edmonton-obituary\">Letter: Lord Graham of Edmonton obituary</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When elected to the House of Commons in February 1974 as the Labour and Co-operative MP for the north London constituency of Edmonton, Graham devoted his maiden speech to education and the need for more public spending on schools and teacher training in order to reduce the disadvantages that still existed for many families in his constituency. He disclosed then that he himself got up in the early hours of every Sunday morning to study for a degree with the recently established Open University. He became the first MP to qualify for an OU degree two years later and in 2005 told the Lords that he was still the only parliamentarian to have graduated from \u201cthe university of the second chance\u201d.</p> <p>Born in Newcastle, the eldest of five children of an unemployed railway porter and his wife, Graham received elementary education at Westgate Road school. An episode seared in his childhood memory was when he was one of six boys called out of class to be given a pair of boots; an act of charity that made his mother cry at the humiliation of him being identified as among the poorest children in the school. After two years as a delivery boy, he became an office boy in 1941 and then joined up with the Royal Marines. In 1944, training for D-day on the English south coast, he was seriously injured when he was accidentally caught in a hail of machine gun fire. His life was saved by an American military surgeon in a US army field hospital.</p> <p>When demobilised in 1946 he returned to the co-op movement in the north-east. He started going to night school, doing correspondence courses with the Workers\u2019 Educational Association and attended the Co-operative College at Stanford Hall, Loughborough. In 1952 he became the organiser of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/jan/26/peter-shea-obituary\">British Federation of Young Co-</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/jan/26/peter-shea-obituary\">operators</a> and the following year he moved south to a post with the Enfield Highway Co-operative Society. In 1962 he was appointed the southern secretary of the Co-operative Union. He was national secretary of the Co-operative party from 1967 until his election to parliament.</p> <p>Graham had first entered party politics in 1961 when he joined Enfield borough council, becoming leader. He understood the importance of local government, which he said later had taught him in a modest way \u201cboth the art of government and the constraints that prevail in government\u201d. He stood against Iain Macleod, then shadow chancellor, at Enfield West in the 1966 election before winning Edmonton.</p> <p>At Westminster he was immediately appointed parliamentary private secretary to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/dec/23/alan-williams\">Alan Williams</a>, minister of state at the Department of Prices and Consumer Protection, and when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/mar/28/guardianobituaries.politics\">James Callaghan</a> succeeded as prime minister in 1976, Graham was made a senior government whip. This caused some minor unhappiness in the whips\u2019 office as he had been parachuted in over the heads of others, but he was a good organiser and hard-working. In 1980 he became an environment spokesman on the opposition front bench. When he lost his seat in 1983 he was promoted to the Lords, where he was Labour chief whip from 1990 to 1997 and then chaired the Labour peers\u2019 group until 2000. In 1998 he was made a member of the Privy Council.</p> <p>Graham continued to work closely with the co-op. He worked with the organisation to develop co-operative housing and he was also involved with the movement\u2019s attempt to resist the change in shop-working hours to allow Sunday trading in the early 1990s. He was a moderate rightwinger within the Labour party and was not afraid to stand up to some of the more radical trade unions, asserting his belief that \u201cprofit\u201d was not a dirty word. He was president of the Co-operative Congress in 1987 and chaired the UK Co-operative Council, the umbrella group for the movement, for a period from 1997.</p> <p>He was a humanist and told the Lords in a debate on faith issues in 2007: \u201cMy faith is in the human spirit and the ability of ordinary people to control their affairs.\u201d He was a keen swimmer and football enthusiast and supported Millwall. As a lad in the Co-op society shop, he once served Jackie Milburn, who promised to get him tickets if Newcastle United made it to Wembley. Ten years later, in 1951, Milburn delivered the ticket as well as the two winning goals in the Cup final \u2013 \u201ca real gent,\u201d said Graham.</p> <p>Graham was much admired for the courage with which he handled a family tragedy. His wife, Margaret (nee Golding), whom he married in 1950, was diagnosed with myotonic dystrophy, a muscular wasting genetic disorder. Their two sons both inherited the condition. Margaret died in 2005 and their sons shortly thereafter.</p> <p>\u2022 Thomas Edward Graham, Lord Graham of Edmonton, politician, born 26 March 1925; died 21 March 2020</p>",
  "<p>When the state of New York received its first confirmed coronavirus patient, both the New York Times and the New York Post published articles with accompanying pictures of East Asian people, even though the diagnosed woman in the news report had recently travelled to Iran.</p> <p>\u201cAnti-Asian racism has come roaring back with the coronavirus scare,\u201d says Korean American writer Cathy Park Hong. \u201cPeople don\u2019t think Asians face racism, but it\u2019s always lurking under the surface. For instance, my friend is worried for his kids. He lives in New York City, and he has a son in school who has been bullied and made fun of for having the coronavirus. There\u2019s this yellow peril stereotype that never goes away.\u201d</p> <p><em>Minor Feelings</em>,<em> </em>Hong\u2019s collection of essays, explores how society\u2019s perception of Asian American identity shapes the experience of being an Asian American. Growing up in Los Angeles, Hong was reminded almost daily that how white America viewed her community clashed with her own experiences. For instance, she writes: \u201cYou are told, \u2018Asian Americans are so successful,\u2019 while you feel like a failure.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMinor feelings\u201d are defined in the book as the feelings that arise \u201cfor instance, upon hearing a slight, knowing it\u2019s racial, and being told, <em>Oh, that\u2019s all in your head</em>\u201d. Hong explains: \u201cWhen I was a kid, I would see my mother clearly being condescended to by white adults, by white women especially ... they would dumb down their words.\u201d She points out that there has been \u201cno critical vocabulary for this dominant culture that was constantly gaslighting my lived experience. Because my experience wasn\u2019t being acknowledged, I had these feelings of shame, suspicion, melancholy, and paranoia.\u201d</p> <p>Asian Americans are often stereotyped as successful, model-minority immigrants. At the same time, they are also often excluded from discussions of US culture. Hong points to the recent primary elections: \u201cAsians are hyper invisible. We\u2019re not even included in racial breakdowns in polls. We\u2019re always listed as \u2018other\u2019, if we\u2019re listed at all. For example, with Super Tuesday, there was so much news about the black southern vote, the Latinx vote, the white rural vote, the white urban vote, the white college-educated vote, but nothing on Asian Americans ... Did they vote for Bernie or Biden? We\u2019re not statistically visible.\u201d Hong sighs. \u201cIt almost feels like we\u2019re not publicly participating in this country.\u201d The racism takes many forms.

It\u2019s playing tennis \u2018while black\u2019 and dining out \u2018while black\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Hong is the author of three poetry collections; <em>Minor Feelings</em> is her first set of essays. It took shape, she says, from watching the comedy films of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/richard-pryor\">Richard Pryor </a>while experiencing a period of depression. \u201cIt was revelatory. The way he talked about race was so brutally honest and funny and unvarnished. It made me think that I had never encountered Asian identity being written in that way.\u201d Watching Pryor also reminded Hong of the Korean term <em>han</em>, \u201cwhich is a collective national Korean emotion of affects that includes bitterness, melancholy, nostalgia, and resentment, that\u2019s rooted in the trauma of war, colonialism, and now, late capitalism\u201d. Hong realised that <em>han</em> \u201cisn\u2019t isolated to South Korea \u2026 There\u2019s this specific combination of feelings when you can\u2019t overcome the structural inequities you\u2019re living under.\u201d</p> <p>As a daughter of immigrants in Los Angeles, Hong says she \u201cwas alienated in the way that a lot of Asian kids are alienated\u201d. Though born in Koreatown, her family moved to the Westside in her early childhood, with her father eventually buoying them to a level of success that allowed Hong to attend private high school and college at Oberlin in Ohio. \u201cOn paper,\u201d she writes, \u201cmy father is the so-called model immigrant.\u201d Behind closed doors, however, the family had to contend with his anger and heavy drinking. Hong says: \u201cFor my family, there\u2019s still this anxiety to assimilate. That\u2019s also a survival tactic, to look ahead and not look back, and to be, if not white, then white-adjacent, which is destructive.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>White America has flattened our experience to a single story \u2013 Minor Feelings is an attempt to overthrow that</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The dissonance between her life at home and the perceptions put on her by the outside world, led Hong to art and writing in her teenage years. Oberlin was where she began to embrace the \u201cbad\u201d English of her childhood. \u201cMy teacher said: \u2018You don\u2019t have to be ashamed of the broken English you grew up speaking. You can use that as a strength in your writing.\u2019 That really stuck with me.\u201d Hong\u2019s essay \u201cBad English\u201d details her evolving relationship with language. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the best benefits of growing up bilingual, right?\u201d she says. \u201cYou realise that meaning is slippery.\u201d</p> <p><em>Minor Feelings </em>\u201cstarted out as poetry, then fiction, and then it became this collection ,\u201d she says, and points to the subtitle of her book: <em>An Asian American Reckoning</em>. \u201cIt\u2019s not <em>the</em> Asian American reckoning.\u201d Hong wants to overthrow the monolithic story of one Asian American identity. \u201cMaybe what I\u2019m responding to is how white America has flattened our experience to a single story, how they perceive us as one kind. The book is an attempt to overthrow that.\u201d</p> <p>Hong is careful to emphasise that she is exploring race through her specific life experiences. \u201cThere\u2019s this fear of exposure, of presenting the right narrative that will put your family on a pedestal rather than knocking them down. I felt that greatly.\u201d She knew, though, that she needed to embrace vulnerability. \u201cI wanted the book to be as persuasive as possible, and in order to be so, it had to reach the reader\u2019s heart, not just their mind.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><p><em>Minor Feelings by Cathy Park Hong is published by Profile.

That\u2019s seven points up on February. Other polls also suggest a tightening race, especially in swing states.<br><br>While Biden still leads the race for the White House by a national poll average of just under six points, Trump\u2019s overall approval rating is also up on previous record lows, to around 47%, according to the <a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/president_trump_job_approval-6179.html\">Real Clear Politics website</a>. Given the storm of mostly negative comment surrounding Trump\u2019s coronavirus performance, how can this be?<br><br>One obvious explanation for what is dubbed the \u201cTrump bump\u201d is that he is, after all, the president \u2013 and Americans, like citizens in <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/out-of-his-depth-world-leaders-battle-coronavirus-with-mixed-results-1.4207078\">other countries</a>, tend to rally round their leaders at times of national emergency. In Italy, the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, is up 27 points in one poll. France\u2019s previously deeply unpopular president, Emmanuel Macron, is up 14.<br><br>George W Bush saw his ratings go through the roof after the 9/11 attacks. His father, George HW Bush, hit 90%+ approval after the first Gulf war and held a parade to celebrate. By these measures, Trump should actually be doing much better in the polls. In fact, when asked whether the country is headed in the right direction under Trump, Americans say no by 55-38%.</p> <p>Such comparisons suggest the \u201cTrump bump\u201d phenomenon should be handled with care \u2013 and a lot of hand sanitizer.</p> <p>There are other reasons, too. Since the Covid-19 crisis erupted, and especially since the White House started holding regular, much-watched televised briefings, Trump has enjoyed something approaching a monopoly of media coverage, dominating the news cycles with dramatic policy announcements and updates.</p> <p>Rarely has the White House bully pulpit been so powerful. But his dominance of the public arena could yet backfire on the president.</p> <p>The fact that Trump\u2019s announcements have often been contradictory, ill-thought-through or plain false, and the fact he has reversed himself with alarming regularity \u2013 the latest U-turn being Sunday\u2019s decision to extend social distancing measures until the end of April \u2013 does not seem to put off many viewers. What they think they see is a man in charge.<br><br>Yet by casting himself as an all-powerful, all-seeing \u201cwartime president\u201d calling the shots in the biggest national health and economic emergency Americans have experienced, Trump is setting himself up for a fall. Many experts predict the measures he has taken so far will prove to be too little, too late and Covid-19 will spread more widely and for longer, and the death toll will begin to rise exponentially.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Trump\u2019s claim to be on top of things has also been helped by the uneven, patchy spread of the virus as of late March</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The impact of Trump\u2019s monopoly on messaging has been strengthened by the the political reality that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/28/joe-biden-campaign-coronavirus\">Biden</a>, for now, appears irrelevant \u2013 and risks being eclipsed by figures on his own \u201cside\u201d, such as New York\u2019s vigorous, tough-talking governor, Andrew Cuomo. That\u2019s good news for Trump.<br><br>Trump\u2019s claim to be on top of things has also been helped by the uneven, patchy spread of the virus as of late March. So far at least, the main hotspots are urban, predominantly in the north-east, and in Democratic cities such as New Orleans, Detroit and Chicago. Large swaths of mid-western and southern rural America are relatively unscathed at this point.</p> <p>This is where a lot of Trump supporters live. Many of them, and perhaps some independents and Democrats, too, may sympathize with Trump\u2019s barely repressed scepticism of recent weeks about the virulence and longevity of the pandemic, and with the importance he has attached to limiting economic damage to people\u2019s livelihoods (and Wall Street).</p> <p>Trump\u2019s gut instinct to dispute expert medical advice, without any evidence, plays into the anti-establishment, anti-science and Christian fundamentalist sentiments nurtured in Trump\u2019s Republican base. So, too, do his xenophobic attempts to blame the virus on foreigners and foes, principally China\u2019s communist leaders, immigrants and Europe.</p> <p>Ironically, the level-headedness, good judgment and common sense shown by a key adviser, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/28/coronavirus-new-york-dr-anthony-fauci\">Anthony Fauci</a>, a leading infectious disease expert, have made up for Trump\u2019s lack of those very qualities. Fauci has added gravitas to Trump\u2019s rambling, incoherent performances in front of camera. But vicarious leadership of this sort cannot work indefinitely.</p> <p>The real problems for Trump and his national savior act will begin when it becomes clear the administration\u2019s failure to instigate a nationwide testing regime, coupled with its refusal to order effective lockdowns of virus hotspots and tardiness in delivering life-saving equipment, is increasing the likelihood of a protracted, rolling nightmare of sickness and misery through the summer and fall.</p> <p>Based on a growing body of evidence from China, Italy and Spain, and prospectively the UK, an ineluctable, lethal spread of the virus may await Americans everywhere if such measures are neglected.

After downplaying the significance of the virus for weeks, he was forced to declare a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/donald-trump-coronavirus-national-emergency\">national emergency</a>.

It is true that his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/commentisfree/2020/mar/24/trump-pandemic-floundering-coronavirus-crisis\">approval ratings have gone up</a>, paralleling what happened with George W Bush after September 11. But Trump is clearly worried about the electoral consequences of a massive death toll and a recession that could see unemployment of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/26/us-unemployment-rate-coronavirus-business\">over 20%</a>.</p> <p>The difficulties experienced by national populists are unsurprising given they are no friends of the issues at the heart of this crisis: health, welfare and science. On the health front, the crisis reveals the folly of decades of underfunding and privatisation of the health system. Trump, Johnson and Salvini have embarrassing questions to answer in regard to their record as enemies of public healthcare. Furthermore, the crisis calls for a sea change in economic policy that is at odds with the ideological premises of national populism, which combines chauvinism on the cultural front and ultra-neoliberal policies on the economic front.</p> <p>The glaring need for state protection of strategic national industries, starting with health equipment and pharmaceuticals, is no anathema for national-populists who have already embraced trade protectionism. But the populist right has strongly opposed welfare measures that are becoming a matter of necessity <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/24/coronavirus-crisis-change-world-financial-global-capitalism\">to avoid social catastrophe.</a> Having repeatedly branded these policies as \u201cdangerous\u201d and \u201canti-patriotic\u201d, these politicians find themselves in the embarrassing situation of having to espouse them.</p> <p>Another skeleton in the closet is national-populists\u2019 disparagement of science. The coronavirus emergency confronts us with a threat that is best understood and measured through the lens of science. Epidemiologists and virologists have acquired media prominence and the public has been diligently following their recommendations. It is not clear whether this will lead to greater public trust in science and an erosion of the anti-science attitudes that national populist leaders have toyed with. However, it can be expected that citizens will take more heed of the risks flagged by scientists, including the climate emergency, which is also bound to exacerbate the spread of diseases.</p> <p>National-populists are well known for stoking people\u2019s fears. But the fears now prevalent are not of the kind these leaders are best positioned to exploit. Due to the urgency of health and economic worries, migration \u2013 the populist right\u2019s main enemy \u2013 has fallen in the list of priorities. Travel bans, and the fact that Europe and the US are the present focus of the pandemic, are leading to a drop in migration to these regions. In fact, we are now witnessing a historic reversal, with Mexico aiming to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-52053656\">block</a><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-52053656\"> the border</a> with the US and African countries suspending flights from Europe, while UK farmers are organising charter planes <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/28/fruit-and-veg-will-run-out-unless-britain-charters-planes-to-fly-in-farm-workers-from-eastern-europe\">to fly in farm workers from eastern Europe</a> to prevent fruit and vegetables being left unpicked. However, if the global economic crisis results in a new wave of migration like that of 2015, this scenario could drastically change \u2013 national-populists will try to validate their narrative of cosmopolitan globalisation as a dangerous vector of all sorts of ills.</p> <p>If the coronavirus crisis has momentarily disoriented the populist right, this does not mean it is vanquished. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/27/coronavirus-populism-trump-politics-response\">It would be misguided for the left</a> to believe that this crisis will work out in its favour. The health crisis is bound to be followed by a deep economic crisis, more similar to the Great Depression than to the 2008 financial crisis, and the populist right has already demonstrated its ability to prey on popular despair and find social scapegoats for economic ills. It can be expected that it will go down the same road, if anything becoming even more vicious.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/hungary-jail-for-coronavirus-misinformation-viktor-orban\">authoritarian measures</a> implemented on Monday by Viktor Orb\u00e1n in Hungary, with the suspension of parliament and the introduction of government by decree, may be the shape of things to come. In Italy, Salvini had no qualms about applauding Orb\u00e1n\u2019s move. We are also likely to see an exacerbation of anti-Chinese rhetoric. Trump made no apologies for calling Covid-19 \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1239685852093169664?lang=en\">the Chinese virus</a>\u201d, while Steve Bannon <a href=\"https://adncuba.com/english/steve-bannon-covid-19-communist-party-virus-trump\">argued</a> that Covid-19 is a \u201cChinese Communist Party virus\u201d. Salvini <a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/03/31/china-isnt-helping-italy-its-waging-information-warfare/\">has proposed</a> that \u201cif the Chinese government knew [about the virus] and didn\u2019t tell it publicly, it committed a crime against humanity\u201d, and allies in Brazil and Spain are adopting a similar line.</p> <p>Given the ties among national-populists, including their botched attempt to establish a \u201cnationalist international\u201d under the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/21/steve-bannons-rightwing-europe-operation-undermined-by-election-laws\">auspices of </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/21/steve-bannons-rightwing-europe-operation-undermined-by-election-laws\">Bannon\u2019s Movement</a>, this synchrony should not be taken as accidental. It has all the look of a coordinated strategy to channel the rage and despair caused by the crisis\u2019s brutal human and economic toll towards a racial and ideological enemy conveniently identified in the Chinese government. Along with self-proclaimed socialists, all opponents are likely to be smeared as \u201cChinese collaborationists\u201d: centrist US presidential candidate Joe Biden has already been termed <a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/2020/03/joe-biden-is-chinas-choice-for-president/\">\u201cChina\u2019s choice for president\u201d</a> by the conservative National Review.</p> <p>What may be in store is thus something much worse than the populist right of the 2010s: an extreme right using the whole arsenal of the red scare and rightwing authoritarianism to intimidate opponents and defend its interests from demands for meaningful economic redistribution.

Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/28/trump-coronavirus-politics-us-health-disaster\">has been widely condemned</a> for exacerbating the crisis by failing to prepare testing kits, breathing apparatus and other equipment.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday his experts said their models showed between 100,000 and 240,000 Americans could die even if the US keeps mitigation measures in place.</p> \n<p>Dr Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus taskforce response coordinator, said models showed a worst case scenario of between 1.5m and 2.2m deaths in the US \u201cwithout mitigation\u201d.</p> \n<p>But with measures in place, she added, the \u201cmountain\u201d could be reduced to a \u201chill\u201d that projects 100,000\u2013240,000 deaths \u2013 still a staggering total. She stressed that the number could be lower if people changed their behavior.</p> \n<p>She displayed a chart in which New York had by far the most cumulative cases, followed by New Jersey, then the other 48 states bunched together. Birx expressed hope that social distancing could prevent major outbreaks in those states.</p> \n<p>Early mitigation slowing the spread of disease in California and Washington state \u201cgives us great hope\u201d, she added. \u201cIt\u2019s communities that will do this. There\u2019s no magic bullet. There\u2019s no magic vaccine or therapy. It\u2019s just behaviour.\u201d</p> \n<p>Asked if Americans be prepared for the likelihood that there would be 100,000 Americans who die from this virus, Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said: \u201cThe answer is yes. As sobering a number as that is, we should be prepared for it.</p> \n<p>\u201cIs it going to be that much? I hope not, and I think the more we push on the mitigation, the less likelihood it will be that number ... We are really convinced mitigation is going to be doing the trick for us.\u201d</p> \n<p>He added: \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to see things go up. We cannot be discouraged by that because the mitigation is actually working ... Now is the time, whenever you\u2019re having an effect, not to take your foot off the accelerator and on the brake, but to just press it down on the accelerator. And that\u2019s what I hope and I know that we can do over the next 30 days.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump eventually heeded such advice, and opinion polls, after previously declaring an ambition to restart the economy by Easter. He announced on Sunday that he was extending to 30 April the guidelines that urged Americans to cease social gatherings, work from home, suspend onsite learning at schools and more in a nationwide effort to stem the spread of the virus.</p> \n<p>Trump spoke after another bad day for the stock market.

Over the next five days, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Poland, and Hungary closed their borders one after the other, even though by that time in any of them the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases had not reach a hundred.</p> \n<p>As a first impulse, <a href=\"https://www.schengenvisainfo.com/news/25th-anniversary-of-the-abolition-of-internal-borders-finds-schengen-with-reintroduced-borders-in-place/\">suspending the Schengen border-free zone</a> after years of free movement is understandable. Leaders naturally wanted to act quickly to avoid a dramatic Italian scenario in their territories. Bear in mind, though, that these decisions to limit the free movement of people were made by politicians not by doctors. Just as when Donald Trump imposed his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/coronavirus-global-recession-fears-intensify-as-trumps-europe-ban-fails-to-reassure\">European travel ban</a> selectively at first, the closing of frontiers in central and eastern Europe has a political significance that goes beyond mere sanitary demands. Politics in the time of plague is still politics. (This is why, by the way, the the much-discussed \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/15/experts-fashion-covid-19-reality-bites-trump-johnson\">return of the expert</a>\u201d is a fantasy, at best wishful thinking.)</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7a98b795-e636-4e75-b443-22e9e6429f26\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/this-is-europe\">This is Europe</a> is a new stream of Guardian journalism that investigates the big challenges that transcend national boundaries, and seeks out the solutions that could benefit us all. These are testing times, and crises are not limited by national borders. But then neither are we. <br></p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The sequence in which the Schengen provisions were suspended in central and eastern Europe tells us something important about societies in this region and perhaps even about the EU in general.</p> \n<p>First, there is the collective psychological dimension. The question of borders here is not just about geography or history, it is an existential one. For decades, post-communist countries have sought to escape Soviet influence in order to \u201creturn to Europe\u201d. The reasons were only partially economic. In all those memorable pictures of the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989, one can see crowds of east Germans who believed they were literally escaping the trap of history. Poles, Hungarians, Czechs and many other nations felt the same. In the 20th century, their central experience was that of cyclical collapse of their states, downfall of sovereignty and existential threat coming from two totalitarian systems. Their desire to join organisations such as Nato or the EU after the collapse of communism derived from their view that the west was a guarantor of institutional stability and personal safety. Joining the Schengen zone in particular, was seen as a way of finally leaving the geopolitical danger zone.</p> \n<p>Those countries should theoretically then have been the last, not the first, to close their borders in 2020. One of the reasons for this is that \u201creturning to Europe\u201d brought on the one hand modernisation and prosperity, but on the other a profound cost. One outcome of Schengen has been the <a href=\"https://www.ecfr.eu/specials/what_europeans_really_want_five_myths_debunked\">mass emigration</a> of well-educated workers. </p> \n<p>The brain drain of doctors has contributed to the dramatic situation facing many healthcare systems in the region. Long before the pandemic, Hungary had considered special contracts for young doctors to stop them emigrating en masse. In Poland, according to official OECD and Eurostat data, the number of practicing physicians per 1,000 inhabitants is <a href=\"https://data.oecd.org/healthres/doctors.htm\">only 2.4</a>. Whenthe UK announced new recruitment for the NHS of doctors from the EU, the understanding in Poland was that Britain\u2019s target was not France or Germany but farther east. Closing the borders has in fact been in the central and eastern European air for quite some time and the arrival of Covid-19 is just a catalyst.</p> \n<p>In spite of their extraordinary transformation since 1989 the post-communist states are also still perceived (including by their own citizens) as weak. True or false, this provokes neurotic reactions to almost any political threat. Radical political language and radical measures are taken because fear of another collapse of the state is still deep rooted. These real anxieties may gradually be eroding faith in joint EU solutions, such as the Schengen zone, which were previously seen as benign.</p> \n<p>The same reasons may explain why, for example, the response of Poles to their lockdown has turned out to be so disciplined and relatively well organised. If the state is weak \u2013 including the healthcare system \u2013 we want to stay at home and where possible organise for others. Voluntary networks in Poland cooking free meals for doctors or preparing additional Covid-19 tests are examples of such behaviour.</p> \n<p>There is therefore something of a perverse relief to the closing of borders in central and eastern European countries because of the pandemic. It might be only a fleeting feeling that will soon give way to a longing for European normality. However, it could also be the other way around.</p> \n<p>The second point relates to the way in which exceptional powers are a source of immense temptation for politicians, especially the illiberal populists in our part of Europe. Could they resist the lure of this extraordinary centralisation of power?</p> \n<p>In our city, Warsaw, like others around the globe, almost total silence reigns; drones take photographs of empty streets from above. But silence in the public sphere matters. In classical political philosophy it was associated with the danger of despotism. In The Spirit of the Laws Montesquieu writes about the deadly silence in the cities when the enemy is scaling the walls. Our adversary today has no legions. It is invisible \u2013 but that does not mean it is less threatening. Contrary to democracy, characterised by a robust and lively public sphere, in despotism people\u2019s interests and activities shift to the private sphere, where they focus on material goods and forget about the community. This threatens democracy, because while people are preoccupied, irreversible changes can be made to the political system.</p> \n<p>Silence in the public sphere will not be compensated for by the din online. In a more romantic era we thought the web and social media would give citizens better tools and make them more active. Today the passivity of citizen-followers is a well-established phenomenon, and our worries are about privacy and the lack of regulation of tech platforms. It is hard to assume that the internet will automatically become a remedy for the deserted public sphere.</p> \n<p>The spectre of a sanitary cataclysm effectively pushes democracy to the sidelines. In those countries where respect for democracy has been established over many years, it does not have to be dangerous. But things look different in places where illiberal populists have already started to translate the 2020 health emergency as the victory of the nation-state over a helpless EU, and the liberal rules-based multilateral order. In Hungary Viktor Orb\u00e1n has been allowed to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/hungary-jail-for-coronavirus-misinformation-viktor-orban\">rule by decree</a> during this state of emergency without any clear time limit and special measures include jail terms for spreading misinformation. Since 1989 no politician has been so powerful in the region.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2020/mar/31/solidarity-members-eurozone-coronavirus-dutch-coronabond\">Without solidarity between members, the eurozone won't survive coronavirus | David Adler and Jerome Roos</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In Poland, the government <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-poland-election/polish-presidential-challenger-urges-boycott-of-may-vote-halts-campaign-idUSKBN21G0NQ\">changed the electoral law</a> overnight to make sure the 10 May presidential elections go ahead, hoping that the only candidate able to organise a campaign is the current president, Andrzej Duda.

In an unusually sombre White House media briefing overnight, the US president said the country had to be prepared for \u201cthe hard days that lie ahead\u201d as the death toll from coronavirus passed 3,800. The worst-case scenario, where rules were not followed, could see up to 2.2 million people die.</p> \n<p>The death toll in Britain <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/green-shoots-visible-in-uks-fight-against-covid-19-says-powis\">climbed by 381 to 1,789</a> yesterday, and included the youngest victim so far \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/31/boy-13-die-london-after-testing-positive-for-coronavirus\">a 13-year-old boy from south London</a> who was reported as having no underlying health issues.

She didn\u2019t teach anybody else. </p> \n  <p>\u201cAnd she called me and said, is Andrew there? I said, \u2018No, mom, I\u2019m all alone here out on the island with my family.\u2019 And she said, \u2018Where is he?\u2019 And I said, \u2018He\u2019s up in Albany in the house with the big gates and the attack dog.

That\u2019s what happened.</p> \n  <p><strong>Governor Cuomo: </strong>You\u2019ve always been good at manipulation. You\u2019ve always been the meatball of the family.
