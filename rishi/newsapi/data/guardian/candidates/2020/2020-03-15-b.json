  "<p>Israeli political parties have backed the opposition leader, Benny Gantz, to form a government, in a shocking blow to Benjamin Netanyahu after he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/03/israel-election-benjamin-netanyahu-claims-early-victory-but-remains-short-of-majority\">appeared to come out ahead</a> in an election held earlier this month.</p> <p>The dramatic news came as a Jerusalem court postponed the prime minister\u2019s corruption trial due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>Leaders of the main parties met Israel\u2019s president, Reuven Rivlin, on Sunday, giving Gantz the slimmest advantage of 61 recommendations from of a total of 120 lawmakers.</p> <p>The endorsement does not end Netanyahu\u2019s chances or guarantee Gantz will lead Israel\u2019s next administration. Before that can happen, he has up to six weeks of negotiations to forge a majority coalition in Israel\u2019s parliament, the Knesset.</p> <p>The success of that scenario remains far from certain. While Gantz will be officially picked by the president as prime minister-designate on Monday, some of the politicians who backed him on Sunday may not also agree to join his government.</p> <p>Fifteen of the recommendations came from an alliance of Arab parties, who may have only supported Gantz to damage their political nemesis, Netanyahu. It remained unclear if the Joint List group, a merger of politicians predominantly representing Palestinian citizens of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/israel\">Israel</a>, would join an administration led by Gantz, a former army chief with whom they have deep ideological differences.</p> <p>Gantz also won support from former defence minister Avigdor Lieberman, who heads the far-right, ultra-nationalist Yisrael Beiteinu party. Lieberman has repeatedly stated he would never join a government with Arab legislators, complicating Gantz\u2019s path to power.</p> <p>The dramatic news came at the end of a day in which Netanyahu\u2019s prospects appeared to be improving. A Jerusalem court announced that the long-awaited first hearing for the prime minister\u2019s corruption trial, scheduled for Tuesday, would be postponed until 24 May due to fears of the spread of the coronavirus in courthouses.</p> <p>About 210 people have been infected in Israel, with no deaths. Battling the outbreak, Israel has already imposed a series of stringent restrictions nationwide during the past few days, including barring gatherings of more than 10 people and shutting down schools, hotels, cafes, restaurants, cinemas, theatres and malls.</p> <p>The upcoming trial \u2013 in which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/21/israeli-prime-minister-benjamin-netanyahu-indicted-for-bribery-and\">Netanyahu faces damning charges</a> of bribery, fraud and breach of trust \u2013 had been hanging over the 70-year-old leader and was set to start right as political negotiations were to begin.</p> <p>For a year, Israel has been in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/01/israel-limbo-third-election-twelve-months-netanyahu-gantz\">state of political paralysis</a> following three inconclusive elections, the latest of which <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/03/israel-election-benjamin-netanyahu-claims-early-victory-but-remains-short-of-majority\">was held on 2 March</a>. In that time, both Netanyahu and Gantz have been picked to form governments and failed. Throughout the crisis, Netanyahu has remained interim prime minister.</p> <p>With neither Netanyahu or Gantz commanding a majority of support, the president has urged them to agree on a power-sharing unity deal. He summoned them for an emergency meeting on Sunday night in the hopes of breaking the deadlock.</p> <p>\u201cWe must establish a government as soon as possible that will lead our people at this complex time,\u201d Rivlin said.</p> <p>After months of acrimonious election campaigning, it is unclear if politicians will be able to break the stalemate.</p> <p>In a clear attempt to block his rival, Gantz has pushed for legislation to bar anyone indicted for a crime from heading an administration.</p> <p>Meanwhile, temporarily freed from his legal woes, Netanyahu has urged Gantz and other politicians to fall in line, arguing that the coronavirus outbreak meant the formation of an \u201cemergency government \u2026 led by me\u201d was all the more vital.</p> <p>Under Israel\u2019s current caretaker administration, the government is restricted in its ability to tackle any major crisis. For example, it cannot pass a budget.</p> <p>Netanyahu said his proposed emergency government could last six months, or that he and Gantz could agree to a four-year unity administration. In that case, Netanyahu would remain prime minister for the next two years.</p> <p>\u201cThe state of Israel needs it. The people of Israel expect it,\u201d Netanyahu said.</p> <p>Gantz accused the prime minister of manipulation during a public health scare. \u201cWhen you get serious, we can talk,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Separately, in an opaque move that raised immediate privacy issues, Netanyahu announced on Saturday night that he intended to use technology developed for counter-terrorism to track people with the coronavirus digitally.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6eabacd19541741268ef781476223c7dd998b4a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6eabacd19541741268ef781476223c7dd998b4a/85_76_3162_1897/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Netanyahu faces damning charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust in his upcoming trial.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Netanyahu faces damning charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cUp until today I avoided using these measures in the civilian population but there is no choice,\u201d Netanyahu said in a televised news conference.</p> <p>The announcement, which needs further approval, prompted accusations of mass surveillance. </p> <p>Noa Landau, who works for the progressive local Haaretz newspaper, <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/elections/.premium-coronavirus-crisis-cannot-chip-away-at-israeli-democracy-1.8675891\">wrote</a> an article on Sunday against what she called the \u201cpoliticisation of the health crisis\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIsrael is already on the edge when it comes to violations of individual rights.

The government machine suddenly looks less like the sclerotic inconvenience that annoys people like Dominic Cummings than the most basic means of help we have. Only weeks ago, people close to Boris Johnson were declaring war on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/jan/04/dominic-cummings-warned-civil-service-whitehall-shake-up-plan\" title=\"\">the civil service</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/dec/15/boris-johnson-threatens-bbc-with-two-pronged-attack\" title=\"\">the BBC</a>; now, both institutions are surely at the heart of however we collectively proceed. Ministers <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p086dkyx\" title=\"\">are suddenly</a> back on the Radio 4 Today programme. Mindful that people have actually not had enough of experts, Johnson is now at pains to be seen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/09/johnsons-coronavirus-press-conference-is-anything-but-reassuring\" title=\"\">deferring to the chief medical officer</a> and the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser. If the big-spending budget suggested that Cummings and his allies\u2019 quest to pull Conservatism somewhere different was in full roar, the arrival of Covid-19 surely means their revolutionary plans for the state have been postponed.</p> \n<p>Something comparable may be afoot in the US. Last week, the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/08/us/politics/trump-coronavirus.html\" title=\"\">New York Times ran</a> a piece of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/johnharris1969/status/1238436656216248324\" title=\"\">political analysis</a> headlined \u201cTrump meets an enemy that can\u2019t be tweeted away\u201d. Covid-19, said the writer, \u201cdoes not respond to Mr Trump\u2019s favourite instruments of power: it cannot be cowed by Twitter posts, it cannot be shot down by drones, it cannot be overcome by party solidarity, it cannot be overpowered by campaign rally chants.\u201d Reality, it seemed, had suddenly intruded on a presidency built on performance and manipulation, and Trump had instantly been found wanting.</p> \n<p>Again, whatever one\u2019s politics, there is an undeniable truth to all this. As we know, the US is <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2020/3/12/21175034/coronavirus-covid-19-testing-usa\" title=\"\">way behind other countries</a> on testing, and <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2020/02/26/coronavirus-covid-19-cdc-budget-cuts-us-trump/\" title=\"\">cuts made by the Trump administration</a> to crucial branches of government now look supremely reckless. The kind of denial the president was still pushing only a week or so ago forms part of the same picture: with accidental echoes of the occasion in 2006 when Johnson paid humorous tribute to laissez-faire government by praising the fictional <a href=\"https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/who-said-it-donald-trump-or-larry-vaughn-the-mayor-of-amity-island-from-jaws\" title=\"\">mayor from Jaws</a> and his decision to keep his beaches open, Trump has recently been lampooned as the real thing, downplaying a mounting emergency, lest it threaten the economic success on which his re-election might depend.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3744dc7eb81aeb132784dde4f3c8608af8602f83\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3744dc7eb81aeb132784dde4f3c8608af8602f83/0_226_4607_2765/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson during a 13 March press conference on coronavirus\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Johnson is now at pains to be seen deferring to the chief medical officer and the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser.\u2019 Boris Johnson at his 13 March press conference on coronavirus.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Facundo Arrizabalaga/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Woven through this take on the president\u2019s position is a progressive article of faith: the idea that although populists might be capable rabble-rousers, they always fall down when it comes to basic competence. This, clearly, is the Democratic party\u2019s collective rationale for the anointing of Joe Biden, the walking embodiment of the idea that the best alternative to Trump\u2019s misrule is the reassuringly dull, conventional statesmanship of yesteryear.</p> \n<p>Might such a sea-change be a realistic prospect? For a long time now, all over the world, politics and government and their surrounding discourse have increasingly amounted to a spectacle of anger, rhetoric and a supposed battle of values in which the political right \u2013 particularly its latter-day, populist incarnation \u2013 has usually been on the winning side. The story perhaps began with George W Bush\u2019s consigliere Karl Rove, and his characterisation of his boss\u2019s detractors as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality-based_community\" title=\"\">\u201cthe reality-based community\u201d</a>: its subsequent milestones include both the arrival in office of a president whose metier is outrage and provocation rather than anything material, and Brexit\u2019s triumph of prejudice and romance over facts and figures.</p> \n<p>As reality bites, something about coronavirus feels like it might at least have loosened the grip of these ideas. Whatever his outbursts, every day brings <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2020/mar/14/trump-coronavirus-test-video\" title=\"\">unflattering footage of Trump</a> among scientists, officials and the representatives of big US companies and the image of an awkward, impatient man, arms folded, seemingly determined to shut out whatever wisdom might be on offer. Here, the BBC\u2019s Newsnight recently saw fit to broadcast a characteristically nuanced view of the government\u2019s response to the virus from Nigel Farage, to a <a href=\"https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/bbc-nigel-farage-newsnight-coronavirus-a4383026.html\" title=\"\">loud chorus of groans</a>. His inclusion seemed not just incongruous, but silly. And therein lay a tantalising prospect: of a political discourse that might sooner or later reconnect to the basics of government, and the real world.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/15/epidemiologist-britain-herd-immunity-coronavirus-covid-19\">I\u2019m an epidemiologist.

Only a week or so ago, he favoured denial. Now, as evidenced by the televised address he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/12/trump-coronavirus-ban-travel-backfired\" title=\"\">delivered last Wednesday</a> and his ban on flights from Europe, his embrace of drastic measures is framed by the kind of themes that won him the presidency.</p> \n<p>His spiel contained the giveaway words \u201cAmerica first\u201d; inside 40 seconds, he used the phrase \u201cforeign virus\u201d. By way of mood music, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/10/republicans-face-backlash-racist-labeling-coronavirus-china-wuhan\" title=\"\">senior Republicans talk</a> about the pandemic as the \u201cChinese coronavirus\u201d or \u201cWuhan coronavirus\u201d, and everything blurs into the ocean of conspiracy theory now swirling around online, which Trump is inevitably happy to stoke.</p> \n<p>Whatever the controversies over its approach to the virus, and the prime minister\u2019s long record of playing to base prejudice, our own government has chosen a higher path. But hateful, ugly things are out there in the culture, and may yet rise to the surface. In stories of public service in the most awful circumstances and a rising sense that the only useful responses to this crisis are necessarily empathetic and humane, you see people \u2013 and governments \u2013 at their best. But whatever the impacts of the most serious health emergency in a generation, perhaps a model of politics based on division and polarisation is now so embedded that it will inevitably condition some of the world\u2019s response. History suggests as much: steps forward always accompanied by lurches back, as humanity does what it usually does, and simply muddles through.</p> \n<p>\u2022 John Harris is a Guardian columnist</p>",

  "<p>Governor Ron DeSantis last week declared a state of emergency in Florida in the face of the coronavirus as millions of Floridians are set to vote on Tuesday in a crucial delegate-rich primary that will help determine whether Bernie Sanders stays in the Democratic presidential nomination race against Joe Biden.</p> <p>In Florida, the impact of the virus, if left unchecked, could be particularly harsh on the state\u2019s ability to allow people to vote or vote safely without fear of infection.</p> <p>The state is home to one of the largest elderly populations in the country, with around <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/FL\">20%</a> of the residents age 65 or older. While this age group tends to be a stable voting bloc for both political parties, it\u2019s also the most vulnerable to the virus \u2013 which has a mortality rate around 18% for those over 80 years old.</p> <p>DeSantis <a href=\"https://www.nbc-2.com/story/41884945/desantis-places-limit-on-florida-nursing-home-visits\">issued an executive order</a> barring people who may have been exposed to the virus from visiting nursing homes. He urged election officials throughout the state to consider moving their polling locations for the state\u2019s 17 March primary out of those locations.</p> <p>But over the weekend before election day, the state seemed to be lacking a unified response, with many polling stations in senior centers and retirement communities still operating at status quo.</p> <p>Workers at Country Aire Manor, Senate Manor Estates, and Crystal Lakes Manor \u2013 Pasco and Pinellas county polling sites all held in communities comprised entirely of people above 55 \u2013 said they had received no guidelines for the election, and were already receiving equipment to set up for Tuesday.</p> <p>\u201cAll locations will be open,\u201d said Robin Lehoux, who works at the parks and recreation department in Pompano Beach, Florida. She hadn\u2019t heard of any instructions from the state or local government regarding the Mullins Park Senior Center, a polling precinct where other senior programming had been shut down.</p> <p>But Florida\u2019s piecemeal response has been a stark departure from other election officials across the country <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/10/coronavirus-concerns-hurdle-voters-primary-elections\">implementing last-minute</a> measures to stave off concerns about contracting coronavirus at the polls. In Ohio, Secretary of State Frank LaRose ordered all polling stations in senior centers and nursing homes to be relocated. Louisiana\u2019s state\u2019s top election official, Kyle Ardoin, announced Friday the primary election next month would be postponed until June.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re playing catch up,\u201d said congressman Darren Soto, who represents a central Florida district that includes Orlando. Soto was still expecting a large voter turnout on Friday, and said he was focused on making sure voting precincts remained open so crowds were dispersed. \u201cThe main thing is to avoid long lines so people can conduct best practices.\u201d</p> <p>Some election officials are still taking full precautions.</p> <p>In Broward county, the local supervisor of elections announced this week the county was moving <a href=\"https://www.browardsoe.org/\">12 precincts </a>from senior centers and assisted living facilities to alternate locations. The county sent out postcards to all of the voters who would normally cast ballots there letting them know their locations had moved.</p> <p>Some senior living facilities don\u2019t want to move their polling locations because they are wary of having to transport residents, said Steve Vancore, a spokesman for the Broward county elections office. In such cases, the county elections office will make sure they have adequate cleaning and sanitization supplies, Vancore said.</p> <p>\ufeff</p> <p>State officials held a conference call with local supervisors of elections on Thursday to discuss sanitary measures they could take at the polls. In Volusia county, the supervisor of elections reminded voters they could bring their own pens to fill out ballots. In Marion county, elections officials have limited cleaning supplies and are encouraging people to bring their own from home, said Wesley Wilcox, the county\u2019s supervisor of elections.</p> <p>Florida is no stranger to adapting elections to emergencies.</p> <p>In 2018, Hurricane Michael derailed precincts in the panhandle, and forced election officials to extend voting hours and move locations. In 2016, a federal judge extended voter registration because of disruptions caused by Hurricane Matthew, despite opposition from Republican governor Rick Scott.</p> <p>But the state often only acts at the last minute. \u201cIt\u2019s a fight every time,\u201d said Brad Ashwell, the Florida director of All Voting is Local, an advocacy group. The organization was looking to support changes for the primary that could include an extension in vote-by-mail deadlines, poll worker recruitment, as elderly poll workers dropped out, and more state funds to advertise changes to the polling stations.</p> <p>\u201cIt seems like the freak out level is slowly creeping in here,\u201d Ashwell said. \u201cI don\u2019t sense anxiety among people. People are upset their conferences are being cancelled. But it doesn\u2019t seem like there\u2019s a real high levels of concern.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, he said, the fears around Covid-19 could build on other issues that voters faced in the state. Under the pressure of lawsuit brought on by civil rights groups and Puerto Rican residents, the state has been attempting to provide bilingual language assistance at each station, which could be impacted if poll workers don\u2019t show up on Tuesday.</p> <p>And the state <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article218654810.html\">rejected</a> tens of thousands of mail-in ballots and absentee ballots in recent elections, stoking mistrust in that system.</p> <p>Danny Turkel, spokesperson for Voto Latino, an advocacy group focused on registering Latinx voters, said he predicted lower voter turnout in the election because of the state of emergency. He didn\u2019t think any specific community would be impacted, he said, but predicted that the uncertainty would keep voters at home.</p> <p>\u201cBeing from Miami, I\u2019m acutely aware of the difficulties people have,\u201d he said. \u201cThere were already obstacles in the way that the state has done nothing to improve.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI think it will show out in the numbers.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>My entertainment options this week were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/12/the-hunt-movie-behind-elites-v-deplorables-thriller\">a movie</a> in which \u201cliberal elites\u201d hunt down and murder \u201cdeplorables\u201d for sport \u2013 deaths that are ultra gory and played for laughs \u2013 and a Hulu documentary in which Hillary Clinton explains with a chuckle and a smile why the policies supported by her 2016 opponent, Bernie Sanders \u2013 policies like universal healthcare and prison reform, which would help countless Americans \u2013 are just not \u201cdoable\u201d. In other words, essentially the same thing.</p> <p>The Hunt was supposed to be released last fall, but it was put on hold after some people wondered if a movie about political polarity and divisiveness in contemporary society, in which a bunch of poor people die violently was really going to be a good idea. Released now, the controversy is its main selling point. And \u2013 since we are in the beginning stages of a pandemic for which the United States is not remotely prepared and in which the uninsured, elderly, and poor are much more likely to die \u2013 well, let\u2019s just say the timing creates a certain tone.</p> <p>The co-writer and producer Damon Lindelof \u2013 who recently read the legendary anti-fascist comic Watchmen and thought, huh, okay, but <a href=\"https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/dr-manhattan-cop-watchmen-frantz-fanon/\">what if instead we made the cops the heroes</a>? \u2013 has created a world where a group of rich, NPR-listening liberals, who bicker about gendered language and whether \u201cblack\u201d or \u201cAfrican-American\u201d is the more acceptable term, drug, abduct, and murder Trump voters for sport. One of the Trump voters actually isn\u2019t a Trump voter but is brought there by mistake, and not being a redneck hillbilly idiot, she manages to fight back. I think that\u2019s a metaphor. For something.</p> <p>Ultimately the film wants to pretend to be a commentary on cancel culture and our new culture wars. It turns out the whole plan for liberal elites to hunt deplorables becomes a reality because deplorables can\u2019t take a joke about liberal elites hunting deplorables. The slapstick deaths are supposed to indicate that hey, we\u2019re just playing around here, rather than show a callous disregard for human life on the part of the film-makers. And if you don\u2019t find it funny to watch a woman impaled on spikes or a man blown up on a landmine or a woman choking to death after she\u2019s poisoned, you must be one of those humorless cancel culture freaks who need to learn to take a joke.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/mar/12/the-hunt-movie-behind-elites-v-deplorables-thriller\">'It's a fun movie, I promise': behind the elites v 'deplorables' thriller The Hunt</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But of course if you\u2019re from and of the coasts it\u2019s easy to believe these new culture wars are just about a difference of opinion about gun control or abortion and not about the hopelessness and loss of meaning and instability causing <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/06/opinion/working-class-death-rate.html\">the deaths of despair</a> killing white middle Americans without college degrees through suicide and addiction. It\u2019s similar to how one segment of the population will remember the culture wars of the 1990s as a discussion about whether a crucifix of Jesus Christ submerged in urine should be considered art, and not about whether the thousands of gay people, IV drug users, hemophiliacs, and others deemed ultimately disposable by the government and society should have been allowed to die from Aids. Or as a debate about whether children should be exposed to vulgarity in music, and not about whether black people or people in poor neighborhoods should be murdered, brutalized, and harassed by the police forces that claim to protect them.</p> <p>It\u2019s not clear that anyone involved with this film has ever even been to the south. The star, Betty Gilpin, plays a working-class woman named Crystal who spends the entirety of the film holding her jaw as if she is trying not to let any spit from the chewing tobacco dribble out, and yet at no time does she partake in chewing tobacco. It\u2019s like she saw a picture of someone once and thought, Oh, that must be how they do it down there, but no one explained to her it\u2019s not just that all southerners have a severe underbite. But then no one involved in the production thought it might be weird for the action of the film to play out in Croatia, a country still dealing with the aftermath of its own \u2026 uh, let\u2019s call it political polarity and divisiveness, I guess.</p> <p>I\u2019m sure the millionaires who endorsed billionaire Mike Bloomberg in the Democratic primaries will watch this movie on their private jets and have a good chuckle at the depiction of clueless and out-of-touch elites heading to Croatia on their private plane with a cargo full of white trash. \u201cOh my God, that\u2019s so us! I also enjoy a little caviar snack while on my way to my private manor in the Balkans.\u201d And then they\u2019ll go back to deciding which underprivileged group should receive their charity this month \u2013 instead of just paying their taxes, which could fund an adequate public healthcare system that would keep people from having to beg online to afford chemotherapy.</p> <p>Cinemas across the US are currently closing because of coronavirus; perhaps only the elites who can afford private screenings of The Hunt in their palatial estates will be able to see it. In the meantime, the rest of us are about to go on quarantine lockdown, forced to sustain ourselves on whatever mediocre bilge Netflix has put out this week. I think that\u2019s a metaphor.

  "<p>Confronted by the coronavirus menace, politicians and governments around the world are thrashing about wildly, trying to decide what to do for the best. \u201cPolitics isn\u2019t working\u201d is a common refrain among disaffected citizens in the modern era. But at this uniquely stressful moment, it really does appear to be true. While they mean well, most leaders haven\u2019t got a clue.</p> <p>The dawning realisation that national politicians cannot be relied upon to do the right or sensible thing, whatever that may turn out to be, has serious long-term implications for democracy and the principle of democratic consent. If the crisis is protracted, a catastrophic loss of confidence in the way the pandemic is managed could lead to unpredictable social disruption across many countries.</p> <p>As is the case with victims of the disease, underlying conditions and vulnerabilities in politics too are being painfully exposed.</p> <p>It\u2019s becoming clear, for example, that healthcare systems, even in wealthy countries such as the US, are chronically under-resourced and unprepared. Confusion reigns widely, fuelled by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/uk-governments-coronavirus-advice-and-why-it-gave-it\" title=\"\">conflicting official advice in different countries </a>about public gatherings, travel, and self-isolation.</p> <p>Some leaders may emerge with their reputations enhanced. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/11/donald-trump-us-coronavirus-address\" title=\"\">For others, the opposite holds true. </a>The virus has already made fools of the world\u2019s two most powerful men. Xi Jinping, China\u2019s president, has faced unprecedented criticism over his handling of the first recorded outbreak in Wuhan. He initially steered well clear of the problem \u2013 an early example of social distancing.</p> <p>But Xi has struggled since to contain the political and human fallout. The death from Covid-19 of Li Wenliang, a young doctor who sounded the alarm in Wuhan in December but was gagged by Communist party officials, sparked an online revolt. Xi finally ventured to the city last week, lavishing praise on its beleaguered residents in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/10/world/asia/coronavirus-china-xi-jinping.html\" title=\"\">what almost sounded like an apology</a>.</p> <p>Predictably, Donald Trump\u2019s reaction has been all about him. Among other inanities, he suggested the pandemic was a fake Democrat plot to harm his re-election chances. Ignoring the science and minimising the threat, he claimed his Mexican border wall had somehow immunised Americans, and likened the \u201cforeign virus\u201d to an alien invasion. It\u2019s embarrassingly obvious Trump is not up to the job.</p> <p>Both Trump and Xi could pay a heavy price. The US leader may have survived impeachment, but come November many voters will not forget or forgive this failure of leadership in a crisis. Xi\u2019s aura of paternal infallibility has shattered. Trust has gone. To restore his grip, it is suggested, he may resort to more intrusive social controls, surveillance and censorship. Yet increased repression could prompt a career-ending backlash.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s knee-jerk reaction in pulling up the drawbridge and blaming others is not unique. Fear not facts has led European leaders such as Austria\u2019s Sebastian Kurz to act alone, hastily <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/10/coronavirus-several-eu-states-ban-mass-events-after-italian-lockdown\" title=\"\">closing borders</a> and barring people from specific countries.

The commission in Brussels is struggling to keep up, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-eu/eu-to-give-states-spending-leeway-to-tackle-virus-fallout-on-economy-idUSKBN21016P\" title=\"\">relaxing rules</a> on deficit spending that have already been broken. Piecemeal, national-level policy-making is a gift to Eurosceptics, not least rightwing populists keen to exploit splits, and could have lasting consequences for European cohesion. Public confidence may take a big hit.</p> <p>There\u2019s no doubt politicians face genuine dilemmas. In Italy, Europe\u2019s worst-affected state, the prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, was initially attacked for doing too much, by ordering widespread testing in Lombardy, and subsequently for doing too little. What is certain is that Italy has received little help from the rest of Europe \u2013 the subject of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/11/italy-criticises-eu-being-slow-help-coronavirus-epidemic\" title=\"\">bitter complaint</a> last week.</p> <p>Now that Italy is in total lockdown, it is being studied like a laboratory guinea pig. Boris Johnson, aware, like other leaders, that his reputation is at stake, treads a fine line between similarly drastic measures and \u201ckeep calm and carry on\u201d stoicism. If it all goes wrong, his defence will be that he followed medical advice. Suddenly, experts are back on top in Britain \u2013 if only as potential fall guys.</p> <p>Many look for leadership to Angela Merkel, Germany\u2019s unflappable chancellor and Europe\u2019s most respected politician. Yet her <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/world/europe/coronavirus-merkel-germany.html\" title=\"\">assessment</a> last week, that Covid-19 would infect two out of three Germans and there was not a lot governments could do about it, was less than reassuring.</p> <p>Merkel called for \u201csolidarity, common sense and open-heartedness\u201d. But her emphasis on Europe-wide cooperation carried a whiff of hypocrisy. Germany and France have limited exports of protective masks and equipment to safeguard domestic supply \u2013 hardly an act of solidarity with the neighbours. Nor is Berlin rushing to bail out floundering eurozone partners.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Looked at globally, the politicians\u2019 performance to date has been mostly unimpressive</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The parallel absence of an effective, joined-up global strategy is also casting multilateral institutions in an unflattering light. The World Health Organization, the lead UN agency that might be expected to wield decisive influence, appears strangely diffident at times \u2013 fearful, perhaps, of provoking a political backlash from heavy-hitters such as China.</p> <p>Global financial institutions are not doing any better. The IMF has <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2020/03/04/sp030420-imf-makes-available-50-billion-to-help-address-coronavirus\" title=\"\">thrown $50bn</a> at the problem. Interest rates have been randomly cut and emergency budgets announced. But compared with the 2008 financial crisis, when governments and central banks collaborated to stave off a banking collapse, international coordination to calm markets and reduce risk is lacking. Virus-related economic damage may thus be worse, and longer lasting, than might have been the case.</p> <p>Despite all the angst, the WHO\u2019s chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, complained about \u201calarming levels of inaction\u201d by politicians \u2013 and it seems many governments remain in denial. That may be due to vanity (in the case of North Korea\u2019s defiantly face-mask-free Kim Jong-un) or incapacity (in the case of poorer countries). Iran repeatedly denied it had a problem, until its leaders started dying. Now it is reportedly digging <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/coronavirus-iran-mass-graves-qom\" title=\"\">mass graves</a>.</p> <p>Unscrupulous politicians stand accused of using the pandemic as cover for furtive power-grabs. The timing of last week\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/08/saudi-arabia-releases-images-king-salman-amid-purge-royals\" title=\"\">high-level purge</a> by Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, and a constitutional coup by Russia\u2019s president, Vladimir Putin, may be coincidental. Or maybe not.</p> <p>In Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu is manoeuvring to stay on as prime minister, despite his corruption trial and his lack of a parliamentary majority, in the face of what he now deems an exceptional national threat. It\u2019s conceivable Trump could use <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/us-launch-airstrike-iraq-retaliation-rocket-attack-killed-three-britain\" title=\"\">new clashes</a> with militia in Iraq to revive his Iran vendetta \u2013 and distract attention from his viral incompetence.</p> <p>The crisis also raises the danger of governments taking so-called temporary emergency powers and imposing sweeping, illiberal constraints on citizens, journalists and social media that subsequently become permanent. That\u2019s what happened after the 9/11 convulsion, when the US and allies decided to largely ignore international human rights protections in the name of fighting terrorism.</p> <p>Looked at globally, the politicians\u2019 performance to date has been mostly unimpressive. Yet the fundamental question raised by the pandemic is not one solely for them. It concerns each individual, community, and nation. Will the challenges posed by the virus be allowed to drive us further apart \u2013 or used to help bring us closer together? The answer hangs in the balance. It could go either way.</p>",
  "<p>A pandemic is testing global leadership and its capacity to rise to the challenge of \u201cthe worst public health crisis for a generation\u201d. To some surprise, the man who said that is addressing the emergency in a more mature fashion than many anticipated when it first began to unfold. Boris Johnson has abandoned the \u201cinvisible man\u201d act for which I mocked him a fortnight ago and located the serious side of his character. The pantomime Johnson has been retired from public spectacle and replaced with the sombre Johnson we now see at news conferences. At his most recent, he struck an appropriately sober tone when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/12/uk-moves-to-delay-phase-of-coronavirus-plan\" title=\"\">he warned</a>: \u201cI must level with the British public: many more families are going to lose loved ones before their time\u201d, words prime ministers usually don\u2019t expect to utter outside wartime. Candour, not a quality always associated with this prime minister, is essential. Fear, panic and conspiracy theories are fomented when people suspect that their leaders are not telling them the truth. The Opinium poll that we publish today suggests that more people than not have confidence in the government\u2019s handling of the coronavirus crisis, but the margin is not a very solid one.</p> <p>The prime minister has been flattered by comparison with Donald Trump. His multiple flaws are being pitilessly highlighted by a crisis that a man who does not believe in scientific evidence or international cooperation is hopelessly ill-equipped to handle. Variously dismissing the coronavirus as \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/28/trump-calls-coronavirus-outbreak-a-hoax-and-links-it-to-immigration-at-rally\" title=\"\">a hoax</a>\u201d cooked up by his opponents to deny him re-election or no worse than the flu, he has swung from juvenile denialism to blaming it on foreigners and Democrats. Then he suddenly announced travel bans and declared a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/donald-trump-coronavirus-national-emergency\" title=\"\">\u201cnational emergency\u201d</a>.</p> <p>The ineffable American president is the quintessential example of a stretch of world history in which populist blowhards have prospered at the ballot box by stoking division, promoting polarisation, scorning expertise and championing ignorance. This crisis, one that now touches every continent on Earth apart from Antarctica, demands leaders who are willing to listen to professional advice, capable of fostering national cohesion at a time of emergency, and skilled at seeking international cooperation. The luckier countries will be those blessed with competent, honest and intelligent leadership. One of the possible positives to come out of this crisis \u2013 I put it no higher than possible at this stage \u2013 is that it will decrease the public appetite for bombastic charlatans and increase demand for serious leaders who respect expertise. If it does, that will be bad for populist hucksters more generally.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The hope is to reduce the scale of the spike and delay it to a warmer month so that the health service isn't overwhelmed</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Mr Johnson has often aped Trumpian populism when he has seen political advantage in doing so, but he is smart enough to grasp that something more grown up is now required. People present at Cobra meetings and other decision-making moments generally report being impressed by the way he conducts himself. I asked one witness, who is not an instinctive cheerleader for this prime minister, how they thought he was doing. The reply came: \u201cPretty well. He is listening intently to the science.\u201d In this respect, Dominic Cummings, his chief adviser and a fervent admirer of science, is acting as a positive influence on the prime minister, rather than a baleful one. Whenever he addresses the country from the state dining room, he has come flanked by Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, and Professor Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer. Thrust into the spotlight in a way neither man can have anticipated, they have both impressed with the clear and calm way they have talked to the nation. They can explain the reasoning for the strategy and how it is evolving with much more credibility than any politician. The polls tell us they will be much more likely to be believed. The government\u2019s senior scientists also serve as the prime minister\u2019s human shields against accusations that he is acting out of ideological fixations or for partisan advantage. No wonder he is clinging to them.</p> <p>The past few days have brought both more clarity and more controversy about their strategy. There is still consensus around one key component \u2013 to try to spread out the rate of infection: \u201cflattening the peak\u201d. The hope is to reduce the scale of the spike and delay it to a warmer month so that the health service is not overwhelmed with patients requiring critical care. In his budget, an event all but eclipsed by the crisis, Rishi Sunak promised the NHS \u201cwhatever it takes\u2026 millions or billions\u201d to tackle the coronavirus, but you can\u2019t spend that money overnight. The NHS needs to increase its intensive care capacity, but that requires more staff, more equipment and more time. The crisis in Italy, whose leadership was slow to realise that they had a problem and who have now imposed an almost total lockdown of the entire country, has shocked ministers. It is widely assumed that Britain is about four weeks behind Italy in terms of infection, though that doesn\u2019t mean we have to end up in the same grisly place.</p> <p>There is not consensus, but mounting controversy, about another critical element of the government\u2019s strategy. Britain has adopted a strikingly different approach to the many other countries that are implementing faster and more sweeping programmes to curtail human contact. These include Ireland, France and Belgium, all close neighbours.</p> <p>That has fuelled the rising pressure on the prime minister to take much more stringent steps here. The pressure is coming both from Labour and from within the government\u2019s own ranks. Jeremy Hunt, the former health secretary, has been the loudest voice asking why we are not seeking to emulate Asian states, such as Singapore and South Korea, that seem to have had some success in snuffing out the spread of the virus.</p> <p>The government is moving towards banning sports fixtures and other mass gatherings, but is still resistant to a more comprehensive shutdown. The scientific reasoning behind Britain\u2019s approach is that more draconian steps won\u2019t make that much difference at this stage, are not sustainable over the longer term, and may well turn out to be counterproductive because it will lead to a second wave of infections when restrictions are eased \u2013 possibly in winter, when the NHS is most stretched.</p> <p>Sir Patrick has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-science-chief-defends-uk-measures-criticism-herd-immunity\" title=\"\">lucidly explained</a> what the strategy is designed to achieve. It expects those on whom the disease has mild effects, the great majority, to be gradually exposed to the virus, building up \u201cherd immunity\u201d. Over time, this will lower the risk of infection for the vulnerable. While this is going on, they will do what they can to protect those for whom the coronavirus could be fatal. Perhaps the most important advice given by the government last week was the simplest. That was to tell people who have flu-type symptoms, however slight, that they should stay at home for seven days. \u201cThat\u2019s not trivial,\u201d says one of those involved in this decision. \u201cThat is a significant amount of social distancing.\u201d</p> <p>Faced with an invisible menace with extremely visible impacts, a clamour for instant and total shutdowns is understandable. But it comes accompanied by the danger that kneejerk responses by frantic governments can end up doing more harm than good. One scientist drew my attention to the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/04/japan-lifts-evacuation-order-futaba-town-fukushima-disaster\" title=\"\">Fukushima</a> nuclear plant disaster in Japan in 2011. Later studies found that around 20 people died from radiation. Many more, about a thousand, lost their lives as a result of the decision to evacuate: casualties of car crashes, heart attacks and other medical emergencies triggered by trying to clear the area in a rush. Sometimes the obvious reaction to a crisis will not be the correct one.</p> <p>Many lives depend on getting this right. The government can\u2019t be blamed for the virus, but there will be fierce scrutiny of its responses. There are risks with the strategy it has adopted \u2013 and huge ones for the reputation of Mr Johnson if the public concludes that his handling of the crisis led to avoidable deaths. There are hazards, too, with the alternative approaches. Various models for tackling the pandemic are now being live trialled around the world by governments of many different complexions and levels of competence. It will likely be a year or so before we will gain an understanding of which of the plans was the smartest. My conversations have convinced me that the British approach is rooted in scientific logic and a careful calibration of the different risks. I\u2019m no epidemiologist so I won\u2019t pretend to be a qualified judge of whether they are doing the right thing. I am persuaded that they are sincerely endeavouring to do the right thing.</p> <p>\u2022 Andrew Rawnsley is Chief Political Commentator of the Observer</p>",
  "<p>The Scranton store where a young Joe Biden used to buy his candy is still in operation today, a stone\u2019s throw from the wood-slatted house where the presidential candidate grew up.</p> <p>It\u2019s called Hank\u2019s Hoagies now, in honor of the idiosyncratic Pennsylvania term for a sandwich on a long bread roll, and almost 70 years since Biden left Scranton, his presence lives on \u2013 in the form of a lifesize cardboard cut out lurking behind the store\u2019s front door.</p> <p>\u201cWe love him,\u201d Tom Owens, the owner of Hanks, said by way of explanation. \u201cHe\u2019s a great guy.

Meanwhile, the ashes of Sanders\u2019 campaign are being sifted through to work out what went wrong.</p> <p>Super Tuesday not only handed back Biden the frontrunner status he held for much of 2019 \u2013 it handed him a big pot of money, too. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/06/politics/biden-fundraising-bernie-brothers/index.html\">His campaign said</a> it had raked in $22m in the five days following that vote, a colossal amount considering it took Biden <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/02/01/politics/2020-democratic-race-financing/index.html\">three months to raise $23.2m</a> at the end of 2019.</p> <p>Biden\u2019s surge has little to do with Pennsylvania, which only votes on 28 April, and much more to do with<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/black-voters-know-what-they-want-tuesday-it-was-joe-n1151001\"> his strong support</a> among African Americans in the south.

Scranton, a town of 77,000 nestled in the rolling hills of north-eastern Pennsylvania\u2019s Wyoming Valley, is firmly a part of America\u2019s rust belt \u2013 a band of towns and cities stretching nearly a thousand miles from Wisconsin in the west all the way through Pennsylvania in the east.</p> <p>The communities in the rust belt suffered more than most from de-industrialization, as coalmines, steel plants and car factories closed, and some areas still suffer from chronic unemployment. Scranton was once home to the coal industry, and the city and region boomed in the 1930s and 40s, but the decline was just as swift. As the US turned to oil and gas for its energy, mines closed and jobs were lost.</p> <p>Biden and his family moved to Delaware in 1953 after his father struggled to find work in Pennsylvania.

He<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/pennsylvania\"> won Pennsylvania</a> by 48.2% to Hillary Clinton\u2019s 47.5%, and he narrowly triumphed in Michigan, Wisconsin and Ohio, too.</p> <p>In 2020, that means Biden\u2019s background is a key part of his case to be the Democratic nominee. If he is chosen, it could prove crucial in recapturing those states and the White House. Biden\u2019s case for being the nominee is based, in part, around his ability to win in the midwest, and he will point to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/10/us/elections/results-michigan-president-democrat-primary-election.html\">his convincing win in Michigan</a> on Tuesday as supporting evidence.</p> <p>That success in the rust belt was a long time in the making, and came after a concerted effort to make people aware of his upbringing: in the space of two weeks at the end of 2019 Biden was still pumping out shamelessly Scranton-specific advertisements, including \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Pr_NcJK5Tw\">Scranton Values</a>\u201d and \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S98mI1tTkVM\">A Kid from Scranton</a>\u201d.</p> <p>In those ads, as in person, Biden looks good for his 77 years.

Swing-district Democrats warned Sanders would hurt their chances of re-election, while members of the Democratic National Committee <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/27/us/politics/democratic-superdelegates.html\">plotted</a> to stop him if he arrived at the convention shy of the delegates needed to win the nomination outright.</p> \n<p>\u201cFrom the beginning, we knew this was going to be the fight of our lives,\u201d said Jennifer Epps-Addison, the president of the Center for Popular Democracy, which endorsed Sanders. \u201cWe\u2019re taking on not only the corporate elite of this party but the billionaire class, the pharmaceutical industry, the prison industrial complex, Wall Street, the insurance companies.\u201d</p> \n<p>Even so, the rapid alignment behind Biden, first by his former rivals and then by millions of voters, caught the campaign off guard. In a matter of days, the field shrank from seven top contenders to just two.</p> \n<p>Moderates, once paralyzed over which candidate to support, suddenly rallied behind the former vice-president. On the eve of Super Tuesday, Biden <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/02/joe-biden-rally-amy-klobuchar-beto-orourke\">won the endorsements of three former opponents</a> and more followed in a dramatic show of force that his team compared to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kbeds/status/1236680535013015553?s=21\">the Avengers assembling.</a> Notably, Elizabeth Warren, Sanders\u2019 closest ideological ally, has not yet backed anyone.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn candor, the consolidation of candidates behind Biden happened sooner than anyone expected \u201d said the congressman Ro Khanna, one of Sanders\u2019 national co-chairs. \u201cThere was simply not enough time to build more broadly.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> \n<p><strong>Bernie Sanders entered the primary with more built-in advantages </strong>than any of his rivals. His name recognition was sky high, he had an enviable list of small-dollar donors, an unshakable base of support and the experience of having just run a presidential campaign. Little changed from 2016, not the message nor the mission, not even the \u201cBernie\u201d logo. It would be a \u201cclass-conscious\u201d campaign for people who felt left out of the political process.</p> \n<p>\u201cHe represents the people who have been written off for much of their lives,\u201d Khanna said. \u201cFor the people who feel they haven\u2019t been heard, who feel marginalized, who feel the system hasn\u2019t been working for them, he is their voice.\u201d</p> \n<p>A heart attack in October nearly derailed his presidential bid. With Warren on the march and Sanders slumping, his candidacy appeared to be in freefall. But his loyal troops rallied to his side. A strong debate performance and a coveted endorsement from the congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez paved the way for a remarkable comeback.</p> \n<p>It proved to be a clarifying moment for the campaign. Sanders used the experience to connect more deeply with his supporters. At intimate town halls and on social media, his team elevated the economic struggles of people who couldn\u2019t afford medical treatment or prescription drugs. It was the foundation of the campaign ethos, \u201cNot me, us.\u201d</p> \n<p>But political reality set in after voting began. Despite his successes in the first three contests, Sanders struggled in a fractured field to retain the support he garnered four years ago. After the centrist vote coalesced behind Biden, he lost state he had won in 2016, when he was far less of a political force than he is today.</p> \n<p>Democrats\u2019 overriding priority in 2020 was to defeat Trump. And on that front, Sanders was losing to Biden.</p> \n<p>\u201cI cannot tell you how many people our campaign has spoken to who have said \u2013 and I quote \u2013 \u2018I like what your campaign stands for,\u201d Sanders said soberly from his hometown of Burlington last week. \u201c\u2018I agree with what your campaign stands for. But I\u2019m going to vote for Joe Biden because I think Joe is the best candidate to defeat Donald Trump.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> \n<p><strong>Black voters have decided the Democratic nominee</strong> in every primary election since 1992. And this year, as in 2016, African Americans <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/exit-polls-2020-south-carolina-primary/\">overwhelmingly</a> chose Sanders\u2019 opponent. In South Carolina, black voters propelled Biden\u2019s triumph and set in motion a turnaround that greatly narrowed the senator\u2019s path to the nomination.</p> \n<p>Supporters believe that Sanders\u2019 effort to make inroads with black voters over the past four years was obscured by Biden\u2019s longstanding ties to African American communities and his eight years as Barack Obama\u2019s loyal lieutenant. After being walloped in the south on Super Tuesday, Sanders\u2019 campaign <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5gcY2Fhr5wo\">released</a> an ad that featured Obama praising the senator and saying emphatically \u201cFeel the Bern!\u201d But it did not yield the results he hoped.</p> \n<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a fundamental disconnect if folks still don\u2019t feel like he\u2019s the one who they can put their faith in after four years,\u201d said Cliff Albright, a co-founder of Black Voters Matter Fund.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f9f21efff9a3b7798ba8c263372716406ca3df77\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f9f21efff9a3b7798ba8c263372716406ca3df77/0_165_4876_2927/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sanders visits custodian Davonta Bynes, from left, principal DaRhonda Evans-Stewart and social worker Kim Little outside a polling location in Detroit.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sanders visits custodian Davonta Bynes, from left, principal DaRhonda Evans-Stewart and social worker Kim Little outside a polling location in Detroit.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Sancya/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Ahead of the Michigan primary, Sanders earned the endorsement of the Rev Jesse Jackson, in what those close to him said was a deeply meaningful moment. In 1988, Jackson became the first black presidential candidate to win millions of votes on a similar platform of universal healthcare, a federal jobs guarantee and taxing the rich. Sanders, then the mayor of Burlington, was one of the few white public officials to endorse him.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe ideas resonate with black folks,\u201d Albright said. \u201cMedicare for All, free college, debt forgiveness, criminal justice reform, on those issues black folks are far closer to Bernie than to Biden. So it\u2019s not the ideas. It\u2019s this issue of electability.\u201d</p> \n<p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> \n<p><strong>Sanders now faces a legacy-defining decision: </strong>does he stay in a race that has become increasingly difficult for him to win or does he bow out now to begin the delicate process of unifying the party?</p> \n<p>Many supporters are not ready to see Sanders exit. Larry Cohen, a longtime Sanders confidant and chairman of his political non-profit, Our Revolution, acknowledged the senator faces long odds but urged him to keep competing. Every delegate Sanders accumulates in the primary, he argued, will be \u201ccritical to negotiations over the rules and party platform\u201d at the convention in Milwaukee this summer.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf he drops out now, those ideas are left with the delegates that he\u2019s won,\u201d Cohen said. \u201cThey\u2019re the voice for these issues.\u201d</p> \n<p>Further complicating the course ahead is a new challenge: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/12/trump-coronavirus-election-impact-bernie-sanders-joe-biden\">running for president in midst of a global health emergency</a>. The coronavirus outbreak has forced Sanders to abandon the stadium-size rallies that are a feature of his campaign.</p> \n<p>\u201cThis coronavirus has obviously impacted our ability to communicate with people in the traditional way and that\u2019s hurting us,\u201d he told reporters during a brief press conference in Burlington, where he has spent his time since cancelling an election night rally in Cleveland last week amid concerns about the virus.</p> \n<p>Yet the senator has signaled in recent days that he is unlikely to battle Biden to the bitter end. But he also made clear that there are issues on which he still intends to confront his opponent \u2013 and on which has the leverage to do so.</p> \n<p>On Sunday Sanders will appear at the next presidential debate, a long-sought one-on-one with Biden. At a press conference, he previewed a litany of policy questions that he planned to press Biden on: \u201cJoe, what are you gonna do?\u201d he intends to ask on issues from income inequality to student loan debt.</p> \n<p><strong>When Sanders launched his campaign in February </strong><strong>2019,</strong> he was asked what would be different this time. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna win,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/19/bernie-sanders-announces-2020-run-presidency\">Sanders replied,</a> with the blunt assurance that thrills so many of his supporters.</p> \n<p>By his own admission, he is falling short of that goal.

  "<p>Life as we know it is about to change dramatically. And when the world eventually emerges from this pandemic, it is likely to be irrevocably altered. In the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p086hjgc\" title=\"\">words of one public health expert</a>, Professor Graham Medley: \u201cThis is the kind of event that is going to live on for decades.\u201d It will either cause illness or death on a scale most of us have not experienced in our lifetimes, or it will take huge changes to the way we live our lives in order to avoid that. The social impact will be more momentous than anything Britain has experienced since the two world wars.</p> <p>This weekend, ministers have warned that increasingly <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexwickham/coronavirus-boris-johnson-tougher-restrictions\" title=\"\">stringent measures</a> will be introduced on people\u2019s movements in the coming days and weeks, and that they are likely to be in place for months. More of us will be asked to self-isolate or to reduce the contact we have with other people for long periods of time. Many will be asked to work from home for weeks, if not months. Travelling abroad will become increasingly restricted. Major sporting and cultural events have already been cancelled, with others likely to follow. In an unprecedented move, local and mayoral elections have been delayed by a year. But by far the most devastating likely impact of this pandemic was hinted at by the prime minister last Thursday. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2020/mar/12/coronavirus-johnson-warns-many-more-families-are-going-to-lose-loved-ones-video\" title=\"\">Many more families are going to lose loved ones,</a>\u201d he said at a press conference. This is the frightening truth about what the government\u2019s top scientists believe is to come.</p> <h2>Policy under scrutiny<br></h2> <p>Amid rising public anxiety, there is more scrutiny than ever of the government\u2019s decision to move from the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/covid-19-government-announces-moving-out-of-contain-phase-and-into-delay\" title=\"\">\u201ccontain\u201d to the \u201cdelay\u201d phase </a>of its strategy. The emphasis has shifted from tracing and testing all those who have been in contact with people confirmed to have contracted Covid-19, to asking all those with symptoms to self-isolate. The government also announced some further limited measures to limit social contact: from next week, mass events with more than 500 people will be banned. But it has faced strong criticism from some public health experts for not taking more stringent action, such as larger-scale closures of places where people congregate, restrictions on public transport, closure of schools and asking more people to self-isolate.</p> <p>The government says it will phase in more stringent restrictions in the coming days and weeks, and that it is not looking at this point to suppress the spread of the virus altogether. There appear to be two interrelated reasons for this. The first is that the government\u2019s experts are concerned that asking people to observe strict social distancing measures for long periods of time, such as widespread self-isolation even for those with no symptoms, could backfire. Like all governments, it is trying to minimise the extent to which demand for critical care exceeds maximum capacity in the NHS, in order to keep death rates from the virus as low as possible and to give the NHS time to do what it can to extend that capacity, already low by European standards. There is clearly a worry that it is untenable to ask people to fundamentally alter their lifestyles for very long stretches of time and that to introduce some measures now would be to risk a significant peak in cases further down the line if people were to abandon those lifestyle changes later on, for example, because they no longer believed they were needed, or could not afford to do so.</p> <p>Second, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser has said that its strategy is driven by the objective of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-science-chief-defends-uk-measures-criticism-herd-immunity\" title=\"\">developing herd immunity</a>, which occurs when a sufficient number of people in a population are immune to a disease, to offer some level of protection to everyone. He has said that the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/coronavirus-millions-of-britons-will-need-to-contract-covid-19-for-herd-immunity-11956793\" title=\"\">working assumption</a> is that about 60% of the population will need to catch the disease in order to achieve that.</p> <p>This implies the government is assuming that, even with social distancing measures in place, it is inevitable that a large proportion of the population will contract coronavirus before a treatment or vaccine becomes available, and the best it can do is to manage the flow of people requiring hospitalisation in order to protect those who are most vulnerable. This sits in stark contrast to the strategy deployed by a country such as South Korea \u2013 whose lead most other countries are following \u2013 which is to delay the rate at which the virus spreads as much as possible, using much more stringent social distancing measures and a more comprehensive testing and isolation regime.</p> <h2>Public confidence<br></h2> <p>This difference has prompted serious questions about why the government\u2019s strategy differs from much of the rest of the world. Would 60% of the population contracting the virus be enough to offer any meaningful level of population immunity? Is it even right to assume that people contracting the virus will develop long-term immunity? On what sort of evidence is the government basing its assumption that the public will only tolerate stringent social distancing for so long? Why does it appear that there have been few measures and little guidance to protect those most vulnerable to the symptoms of Covid-19 \u2013 older people and those with underlying medical conditions \u2013 as the disease spreads? On the other hand, there are huge uncertainties and risks involved in trying to halt the spread of the disease as much as possible at this time. What would happen if people broke quarantine before a treatment or vaccine was developed? What might be the impact on the NHS of a large peak in cases as we move into next winter? What would be the impact of immediately closing schools, given that grandparents are likely to pick up the childcare slack and children are more likely to mix outside school the longer closures go on? This would significantly affect the availability of those doing critical jobs in the NHS, care homes and the food supply chain.</p> <p>This is why anyone who expresses with absolute certainty that the government has got this entirely wrong should be treated with some scepticism. There is no surefire way to combat the virus: there are too many unknowns for that. It is however, absolutely right that public health experts are asking questions about why this strategy is so divergent from the overall recommendations of the World Health Organization. The government must be far more transparent about the evidence and assumptions on which it is basing its decisions, or risk undermining public confidence in its actions.</p> <p>There are other problems beyond a lack of transparency. Ministers have said they will seek to legislate for sweeping emergency powers that will last for two years, including giving the police the power to detain suspected victims of the virus, and reducing standards in care homes to allow for staff shortages. Such powers should be avoided unless absolutely necessary, and should initially be introduced on a more temporary basis to avoid significant incursions on our liberty and a watering down of basic standards becoming the new norm. Moreover, after a decade of austerity that has put services like the NHS and social care under intolerable strain, and eroded tax credits for families, there are questions to be asked about whether last week\u2019s budget went far enough in terms of channelling additional resources to public services and protecting low-income families from the forthcoming massive economic shock.</p> <h2>International cooperation<br></h2> <p>The contrast between the approach taken by the UK and the rest of the world has also prompted questions about the lack of coordination at an international level, both in relation to the public health or the economic response. \u201cOur willingness to cooperate is becoming inversely related to our need to do so,\u201d Gordon Brown <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-crisis-leaders-failing-gordon-brown\" title=\"\">wrote last week</a>. He is right: this pandemic is exposing the extent to which the international organisations and networks that exist to promote global cooperation are fraying as a result of the spread of populism. At a moment when the US might once have provided global leadership, President Trump is flailing; having spent weeks denying the existence of a looming pandemic, he has now politicised the crisis, erratically introducing measures that seem designed to bolster his America First re-election campaign rather than protect citizens. Coronavirus may be the most pressing and immediate global challenge we face; but there are plenty more to come, from microbial resistance to the climate crisis. Effective solutions will only be found if countries rediscover a willingness to work in concert.</p> <p>International cooperation may be proving elusive, but we should take hope from one comfort that might emerge from this crisis: it is heartening to see so many individuals pitching in to help neighbours, or offering to support older people who may be isolated and lonely. This pandemic may leave us a legacy of social action and civic engagement that we should seek to sustain long after its worst threat has subsided. Life may be about to change immeasurably in a way most of us would not have dreamed of just weeks ago. But by looking out for each other, by following government advice even as we question it with healthy scepticism, and by acting for the greater good, we can collectively try to minimise the pain that will undoubtedly be wrought by this pandemic.</p>",
  "<p>With his back to the wall, Donald Trump turned to perhaps the only people that truly impress him: not health experts or scientists but the titans of corporate America.</p> <p>Confronted by a global pandemic he cannot <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/09/donald-trump-coronavirus-response\">bully, insult or out-tweet</a>, the president paraded chief executives at the White House in the hope they could dig him out of a hole partly of his own making.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/13/donald-trump-coronavirus-national-emergency-sketch\">'I don't take responsibility': Trump shakes hands and spreads blame over coronavirus</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Retailers such as CVS, Target, Walmart and Walgreens \u2013 household names in America \u2013 will provide \u201cdrive-thru\u201d testing for the coronavirus, Trump promised, while Google was developing a national website to offer guidance.</p> <p>This, however, came as a surprise to Google. The tech giant <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/13/21179118/google-coronavirus-testing-screening-website-drive-thru-covid-19\">denied it is doing any such thing</a>.</p> <p>The bizarrely misleading claim was indicative of Trump\u2019s mishandling of a crisis different in magnitude from any he faced before. The former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s Russia investigation and the Ukraine scandal that led to Trump\u2019s impeachment did not send markets into free fall, force mass closures of schools and sporting events or potentially put millions of lives at risk.</p> <p>The acid test of Trump\u2019s maverick leadership has finally come.</p> <p>His response so far has been \u201chaphazard\u201d, said <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MichaelSteele?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Michael Steele</a>, former chairman of the Republican National Committee. \u201cWhen you start from the point of thinking the whole thing is a hoax, or at least something your political opponents are ginning up to use against you, it colours your whole approach.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s original sin was committed two years ago when he disbanded a White House office dealing specifically with preparation for pandemics. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NewsHour/status/1238572800186757120?s=20\">His discomfort on this topic</a> was clear on Friday when a reporter asked him about it.</p> <p>\u201cWell, I just think it\u2019s a nasty question,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about it.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s second big mistake was turning down the offer of a German-made diagnostic test approved by the World Health Organization (WHO). Asked about the shortage, which left America lagging far behind South Korea and other countries, Trump said: \u201cI don\u2019t take responsibility at all.\u201d</p> <p>The past few weeks have also brought a cascade of false statements that sought to downplay the severity of the threat and wish it away. The coronavirus is not as bad as the seasonal flu, Trump has maintained, and will disappear in the warmth of spring. The slump of financial markets, on which Trump has yoked so much of his re-election hopes, finally seized his attention.</p> <p>Everything he did, however, just seemed to make matters worse. He toured the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta wearing a \u201cKeep America Great\u201d cap, boasting of his \u201cnatural ability\u201d to understand the subject and making the bogus assertion that any American who needs a coronavirus test can get one.</p> <p>On Wednesday this week he addressed the nation from the Oval Office, live on primetime TV. It was, in many viewers\u2019 estimation, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/11/donald-trump-us-coronavirus-address\">an unmitigated disaster</a>, fueling anxiety rather than calm, panic rather than reassurance. Trump blindsided European officials by announcing a 30-day travel ban and made some basic factual errors the White House had to correct.</p> <p>Then came Friday\u2019s rose garden reset. Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/donald-trump-coronavirus-national-emergency\">declared a national emergency</a> that released $50bn for state and local governments. Shaking hands with chief executives despite medical advice on social distancing, the president promised a public-private partnership to finally make testing widely available.</p> <p>His eternally loyal vice-president, Mike Pence, did his best to reshape the narrative.</p> <p>\u201cThis day should be an inspiration to every American,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause thanks to your leadership from early on, not only are we bringing a whole-of-government approach to confronting the coronavirus, we\u2019re bringing an all-of-America approach.</p> <p>\u201cMr President, from early on, you took decisive action. You suspended all travel from China \u2026 throughout this process, Mr President, you\u2019ve put the health of America first.\u201d</p> <p>It was an attempt to right the ship and restore confidence. But will it work?</p> <p>There was a promising sign on the stock market. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped nearly 2,000 points \u2013 its biggest point gain ever.</p> <p>Furthermore, there are few signs that the coronavirus shambles has disillusioned Trump\u2019s supporters. Some 87% of Republicans approve of his handling of the problem, according to a Quinnipiac University poll.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jul/29/sean-spicer-trump-briefing-book\">Sean Spicer</a>, a former White House press secretary, said: \u201cI think they came out really strong in terms of declaring flights shut down [from China].

Where he got good reviews lies in the government\u2019s overall approach.\u201d</p> <p>Whalen noted that California\u2019s Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, had praised Trump for supporting his state in the repatriation of passengers from a coronavirus-infected cruise ship.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/californias-democrat-governor-praises-trumps-coronavirus-response-every-single-thing-he-said-1491294\">Newsom told reporters</a>: \u201cWe had a private conversation, but [Trump] said: \u2018We\u2019re gonna do the right thing\u2019 and \u2018You have my support, all of our support, logistically and otherwise\u2019. He said everything I could have hoped for and we had a very long conversation and every single thing he said, they followed through on.\u201d</p> <p>Trump will almost certainly face Joe Biden in November\u2019s presidential election. Standing before US flags, the former vice-president gave a speech this week about his plan to tackle the coronavirus, presenting the image of a government in waiting.</p> <p>It made for a telling contrast with Trump, who may find himself haunted by the spectre of George W Bush\u2019s bungled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/sep/14/hurricanekatrina.usa\">response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/coronavirus-washington-state-us-outbreak\">Why Washington state is at the center of the US coronavirus outbreak</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Whalen said: \u201cThe question is how does he handle this as on a personal level.

Nobody elected Trump on the principle that he\u2019d be the hugger-in-chief or the consoler-in-chief.</p> <p>\u201cThe economy is his trump card at all times.
