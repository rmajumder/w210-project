There has been a lot of progress in ramping up testing capabilities, with pretty much all countries on the continent now theoretically able to test their citizens for the disease. As elsewhere however, there are shortages in the key chemicals needed for the tests, and that\u2019s causing problems.</p> \n  <p>This is particularly true in South Africa, which has the highest number of cases and has adopted a strategy based on aggressive screening and testing to try to stamp out any clusters and outbreaks of the disease before it can spread.</p> \n  <p>Officials in South Africa have yet to decide whether to extend the lockdown in South Africa, now in its third week.

One possibility may be to lift some restrictions but maintain strict rules to limit social distancing, but, they say, nothing is decided.</p> \n  <p>Other governments across the continent will face similar decisions in coming days and weeks.

The other person who runs or cycles just behind this leading person in the slipstream then moves through that cloud of droplets.</p> \n   <p>The slipstream is the zone that arises right behind a person when they are walking or cycling, and which pulls the air a bit along with this moving person, as it were.</p> \n   <p>Cyclists like to position themselves in the slipstream of others to reduce their air resistance. But someone who walks or runs also has such a slipstream. We have seen that no matter how that zone forms, droplets end up in that air stream.

It said: \u201cThe company has always been extremely cooperative and transparent with regulators. In many instances, we have gone beyond what has been requested to demonstrate how our business operates and serves our customers following the highest international standards.\u201d</p> <p>The move by the Trump administration comes months after a bipartisan letter from two senators \u2013 Democrat Chuck Schumer of New York and Republican Tom Cotton of Arkansas \u2013 called on the FCC to rethink previous authorisations to China Telecom, citing the Chinese government\u2019s role in promoting economic espionage.</p>",

this will provide a short-term source of additional liquidity to the government if needed to smooth its cashflows and support the orderly functioning of markets, through the period of disruption from

What do they have that I don\u2019t have? Is it swag?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>He was of course joking, Noah clarified, because \u201cif anything, it\u2019s refreshing to see President Trump so concerned about the black community. But when he says it doesn\u2019t make sense that coronavirus is hitting black Americans the hardest \u2013 it\u2019s actually the opposite. Because when you look at the systemic and economic factors facing black people in America, it makes complete sense.\u201d Black people are overall less likely to have health insurance, more likely to have pre-existing health conditions such as diabetes, and more likely to be in service jobs without work-from-home options.</p> <p>\u201cAnd of course, there\u2019s always just straight-up racism that affects black people as well,\u201d Noah said, such as implicit bias leading doctors to discount symptoms. \u201cSo while almost every industry around the world is shut down, it looks like racism is still considered an essential service.\u201d</p> <h2>Samantha Bee</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6Z6fzpJXAA\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/J6Z6fzpJXAA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>As the coronavirus crisis extends into another month, \u201cthe Trump administration has been busy abusing their power and pulling some truly shady shit while we\u2019ve all been busy crafting masks out of our underwear,\u201d said Samantha Bee on Full Frontal. Bee presented a distressing list of changes: rollbacks of EPA regulation and emission standards, and more abuses of power at Ice, \u201cthe least necessary government agency since the Bureau of Cassette Tapes and LaserDiscs\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIce decided that since everyone isn\u2019t terrified enough right now, they should keep doing raids while people are stuck at home,\u201d Bee said, noting how agents in Los Angeles had made arrests on the first night of California\u2019s lockdown. \u201cHow is it essential to separate families during a health crisis? The only separation that desperately needs to be done right now is separating my hair from my body. I\u2019ve been a mess since my waxing place closed.</p> <p>\u201cTrump has also used the virus as an excuse to try to slash taxes, make the cuts to the federal interest rate that he already wanted to and to advance anti-union efforts,\u201d Bee continued, which is \u201cthe most work he\u2019s ever done. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever say this but someone please find a way to sneak him on to a fucking golf course!</p> <p>\u201cI know it\u2019s hard to think about anything other than our families, our friends or what our tits will look like after months of not wearing a bra,\u201d Bee concluded, \u201cbut unfortunately, we have to. What our government does right now will have a lasting impact on all of us, long after this pandemic is over.\u201d</p> <h2>Seth Meyers</h2> <p>\u201cSeems like almost every day we get more and more evidence that the Trump administration knew well in advance of the very real threat of a pandemic, and that they both ignored it and lied to the American people about it,\u201d said Seth Meyers on Late Night. He showed a series of clips in which Trump claimed the pandemic was impossible to predict, such as: \u201cNobody knew there\u2019d be a pandemic or an epidemic of this proportion.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OozvkPVI7LI\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OozvkPVI7LI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u201cSo nobody could see this coming,\u201d Meyers deadpanned. \u201cYeah, Taiwan and South Korea and New Zealand and Singapore were all surprised. That\u2019s why they have a combined total of 12,000 cases and we have a total of 400,000 cases.</p> <p>\u201cDespite Trump\u2019s repeated claims that no one could have foreseen this, it turns out a lot of people foresaw this,\u201d Meyers continued and listed the times Trump was warned about the pandemic:</p> <p>\u201cFirst, Obama officials walk Trump aides through a global pandemic exercise in 2017. Then, in 2017 and 2018, threat assessment intelligence analysts even mentioned a close cousin of coronavirus by name, saying it had pandemic potential. Then in 2018, the director for medical and biodefense preparedness at the national security council told a symposium that the threat of pandemic flu is our number one health security concern. Then, top administration officials said last year that the threat of a pandemic kept them up at night. Then, White House economists warned in 2019 a pandemic could devastate America. Then, intelligence reports warned of a coronavirus crisis as early as November. And then, US intelligence reports from January and February warned about a likely pandemic.</p> <p>\u201cWell, you know, the saying: eight strikes and you\u2019re out,\u201d Meyers concluded. \u201cSeriously, how many incredibly specific warnings do you need?\u201d</p>",
  "<p>The prime minister is approaching his fourth night\u2019s stay in intensive care. We are told, by government, that he is \u201cimproving\u201d \u2013 and more recently, today, by a spokesman, that he is \u201cin good spirits\u201d. However, fear around the severity of his condition, and uncertainty around how long he will be absent from leading the country, has inevitably led to worries around the government\u2019s handling of communications around Johnson\u2019s health. Governments have, historically, struggled with delivering this kind of news.</p> <p>No government relishes the prospect of delivering bad news. And all governments have familiar ways of approaching the problem. Sluggish statistics are buried in budgets. Press releases are unsubtly reordered. Eye-catching announcements are thrown out on the same day that an otherwise negative story would dominate.</p> <p>The scepticism that this communication spin breeds can be a big problem in a crisis, never more so when dealing with something so sensitive and important as the health of the prime minister. Compared to the cases of past prime ministers who have fallen seriously ill, the government has been fairly timely in delivering news of serious changes to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/08/boris-johnson-improving-sitting-up-bed-chancellor-says-coronavirus\">Boris Johnson\u2019s condition</a>. But there are reasons why sceptics worry.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/02/government-publish-data-coronavirus-deaths\">Why isn't the government publishing more data about coronavirus deaths? | Jeni Tennison</a> </p> </aside>  <p>During a crisis, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/02/government-publish-data-coronavirus-deaths\">transparency has to be the watchword</a>. Losing the support of the public and the confidence of the media can badly damage trust in the government\u2019s response and increase panic and confusion. The best approach is to get ahead of the bad news, to spell out that worse is to come and that times will be difficult. After an initial burst of characteristic optimism, Boris Johnson did just this: he told the public that he would \u201clevel\u201d with them that \u201cmany more families are going to lose loved ones before their time\u201d.</p> <p>The news that the prime minister had been taken into intensive care was shocking. But it also caught many by surprise \u2013 the message from the government had until then focused on Johnson\u2019s continued commitment to his workload and, as Johnson himself set out in a tweeted video, his improving condition. It shows up the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/07/boris-johnson-illness-horror-coronavirus\">harsh reality of this virus</a> - how quickly it can turn far more serious.</p> <p> When prime ministers have fallen ill on the past, governments have often deliberately restricted how much information was shared with the public. Towards the end of 1918, as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/audio/2020/apr/09/lessons-from-the-1918-spanish-flu-pandemic\">Spanish flu spread across the globe</a>, David Lloyd George\u2019s sore throat developed into a full-blown case. He collapsed and was hospitalised, but the seriousness of his condition \u2013 the prime minister was on a ventilator for more than a week \u2013 was kept quiet.</p> <p>In July 1953, when Winston Churchill had a stroke, it was kept quiet. With his assumed successor Anthony Eden in hospital himself, cabinet ministers found themselves discussing whether Churchill could remain in office without the news leaking until October, when it was hoped Eden would have recovered. Following that botched operation on an ulcer, Eden would be in considerable pain throughout his premiership \u2013 but details of the medication he used to manage that pain were not shared with the public and the extent of his drug use during the 1956 Suez crisis has long been a controversial question for historians.</p> <p>This approach is not confined to history, or the UK.

There is a personal element as well \u2013 patients, however important, want to protect medical details, and there are family members whose privacy needs to be protected too. Which won\u2019t stop journalists seeking to check that bad news is not being withheld. The era of Twitter is a big contrast to 1953, when one of the first people to know about Churchill\u2019s condition was Pamela Berry, whose husband\u2019s family owned the Daily Telegraph. It was never leaked.</p> <p>The fact that the message came out so strongly that Johnson was doing well, until worse news arose, might be that his condition deteriorated rapidly; it could equally be the case that Downing Street was attempting to manage an increasingly worrying situation, or that the prime minister himself wanted to present a positive picture.</p> <p>The prime minister will no doubt accept the interest in his health. It comes with the job. But it is also a reminder that, as coronavirus particularly shows, anyone can get ill.

Germany has abandoned its hardline opposition to running budget deficits. Central banks have turned the electronic money-printing presses back on.

Early on, some economists had dared to hope for a V-shaped rebound worldwide.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: YONHAP/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the early stages of the market panic \u2013 from late February to early March \u2013 the assumption was that the pain would be intense but relatively short. Activity would plunge but then rebound just as quickly. This, though, presupposed that the lockdowns would be only temporary and that no real permanent damage would be done.</p> <p>Now the chances of a V-shaped recession look less likely. Even from the small amounts of data available it is obvious economies are in the middle of a collapse unprecedented in modern times.</p> <p>What is unclear now is how fast they will recover. China is coming out of lockdown, and some European countries such as Austria are planning to do the same, but restrictions remain in place and the mood of consumers remains cautious. Forecasters have started to talk about a steep downturn followed by a slow \u2013 and perhaps uneven \u2013 recovery.</p> <p>This looks much more plausible. Governments are going to be wary of the virus coming back. Consumers and businesses are going to take time to get over the shock. It will take some time before many people feel safe to travel abroad. There may be deeper changes too: more working from home, a further blow to high-street retailers. As yet little attention has been paid to how all the extra government spending will be paid for.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Sign up to the daily Business Today\u00a0email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/3887\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for Business Today\" data-form-description=\"Get the headlines and editors' picks every weekday morning.\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Sign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Aware of the mounting costs, governments are desperate to get their countries back to work.

Emergency powers have been enacted allowing the minister to exempt ventilators from parts of the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 which ensure conformance with safety and performance requirements. <br><br>Such exemptions can be made only by the minister \u201cso that the devices can be made available urgently in Australia in order to deal with an actual threat to public health caused by an emergency\u201d. A description of the new powers says:</p> \n  <p>\u201cThe effect of the instrument is to exempt these ventilators from certain requirements under the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 in order to deal with the threat to public health caused by the Covid-19 emergency.\u201d<br><br>The new powers were registered on Wednesday and will cease on 31 January 2021. You can read the <a href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2020N00046\">full detail on those exemption powers</a> here.<br><br>The powers appear designed to allow new suppliers of ventilators to get them into Australian hospitals as quickly as possible to deal with the Covid-19 crisis. </p> \n  <p>Ventilators are critical in the fight against the virus because they aid the failing lungs of the most seriously ill patients. Australia had about 2,300 ventilators in intensive care units across the country before the crisis, but the government is seeking to dramatically increase that number as it surges ICU capacity. <br><br>Only one company in Australia, Resmed, manufactures ventilators and it has been working overtime to increase its output. The government has also been attempting to procure more ventilators from abroad and kickstart new domestic manufacturers by securing existing designs used by foreign companies. <br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-09T02:31:53.150Z\">at 3.31am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8e87638f08008f0919fae4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/paul-karp\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-09T02:24:55.987Z\">3.24am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>I was curious how the government could just declare that pay rises will be deferred in the public service, because most employees would be covered by enterprise agreements, with pay increases agreed, scheduled and seemingly locked in.<br>Assistant minister to the prime minister and cabinet, <strong>Ben Morton</strong>, explained it will be done through a determination using s.24(3) of the Public Service Act. <br></p> \n  <p>That section says:<em>\u201dThe Public Service Minister may, by legislative instrument, determine the terms and conditions of employment applying to APS employees, <strong>if the Public Service Minister is of the opinion that it is desirable to do so because of exceptional circumstances</strong>.\u201d</em><br></p> \n  <p>Professor <strong>Anthony Forsyth </strong>told Guardian Australia the Act \u201cdoes appear to allow\u201d a determination to overrule enterprise agreements although it \u201cdepends on the meaning of exceptional circumstances\u201d.<br></p> \n  <p>\u201c[But the] opinion that it is desirable to do so is not the same as necessary,\u201d Forsyth said.<br></p> \n  <p>He also noted that according to the Act section 42 of the Legislation Act - on disallowance - does not apply - meaning that one of the \u201cordinary processes of parliamentary scrutiny ... looks like [it] doesn\u2019t apply\u201d.<br></p> \n  <p>The Community and Public Sector Union is upset about the move, but agrees with the conclusion that it is legal.<br></p> \n  <p>So there you have it - one of the quirks of working in the public service, maybe better job security than the private sector but employment conditions altered at the stroke of a pen.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8e859b8f08008f0919fada\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-09T02:17:14.025Z\">3.17am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">National park visits over Easter are out</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>A reminder that national parks are closed \u2013 which includes to Easter visitors.<br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-09T02:29:48.944Z\">at 3.29am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8e84e08f08008f0919fad3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-09T02:15:40.958Z\">3.15am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Australian Academy of Science is continuing its great series, where scientists and researchers answer your questions.</p> \n  <p>They get it fact-checked too, so you don\u2019t have to worry about the Malcolm Roberts of the world delivering your information.</p> \n  <p>The latest is on whether or not childcare centres are safe.<br></p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://vimeo.com/405238449\"> \n   <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/405238449?app_id=122963\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> \n   <figcaption>\n    Australian Academy of Science\n   </figcaption> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-09T02:18:46.585Z\">at 3.18am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e8e838c8f08ec70ceced461\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-09T02:13:01.295Z\">3.13am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The national cabinet is about to meet.

Reflecting the grim state of affairs, Biden on Wednesday marked the moment with little fanfare.</p> <p>\u201cThis primary is over \u2013 but this campaign is just beginning,\u201d he wrote in a fundraising email to supporters, with the subject line \u201cBernie\u201d. In the appeal, he added that he was \u201cso damn proud\u201d to be the Democratic nominee.</p> <p>It was result that seemed unlikely just two months ago, when Biden finished fourth and fifth against his Democratic rivals in the Iowa and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/10/new-hampshire-primary-bernie-sanders-pete-buttigieg\">New Hampshire</a> contests respectively, and came in a distant second behind Sanders in Nevada. But black voters <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/feb/29/south-carolina-primary-voters-joe-biden-bernie-sanders\">revived his candidacy</a> in South Carolina, in a remarkable turnaround that set in motion his unstoppable march to the nomination.</p> <p>After accumulating an all-but indomitable lead over Sanders in March, Biden\u2019s grasp of the nomination was hardly in doubt. But the coronavirus forced the race into a state of suspended animation, as more than 15 states delayed their primaries and candidates were forced to cancel traditional campaign events.</p> <p>Now with primary race firmly behind him, Biden can turn to what is certain to be an extraordinarily divisive and wildly unpredictable general election campaign.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"32ed99fc664fc945ce330cf8332582c49beb7e53\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/32ed99fc664fc945ce330cf8332582c49beb7e53/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"From a makeshift TV studio in the basement of his Delaware home, Biden connects with voters by internet live streams and TV appearances.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">From a makeshift TV studio in the basement of his Delaware home, Biden connects with voters by internet live streams and TV appearances.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThank goodness we can finally get to work,\u201d his wife, Jill Biden, said during a virtual fundraiser on Wednesday afternoon. \u201cWe could never presume that before.\u201d</p> <p>Like most Americans, Biden is homebound for the foreseeable future. From a makeshift TV studio in the basement of his Delaware home, he communicates daily with staff and policy advisers while connecting with voters by internet live streams and TV appearances. But Biden has struggled to find his voice in the midst of this national crisis.</p> <p>Though Trump, too, has been forced to suspend campaign activities, he delivers daily coronavirus task force briefings that critics argue increasingly resemble in tenor and length his raucous <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/24/donald-trump-coronavirus-briefings-2020-campaign-rallies\">Make America Great Again rallies</a>.</p> <p>Biden, who has spent most of his life in government, has walked a fine line in criticizing Trump\u2019s handling of the virus. Eager to avoid a \u201cpolitical fight\u201d with the president in a moment of crisis, he is also keenly aware that the pandemic and related economic devastation will likely determine who occupies the White House in a year\u2019s time.</p> <p>Biden and Trump spoke by phone for the first time this week to discuss the federal response to the outbreak. The idea for the call came from the White House counsellor Kellyanne Conway, who urged him to stop criticizing the president and instead offer his support.</p> <p>\u201cHe had suggestions,\u201d Trump said, describing the call as \u201cwonderful\u201d and \u201cwarm\u201d. But he added that it \u201cdoesn\u2019t mean I agree with those suggestions\u201d.</p> <p>Biden mostly echoed Trump\u2019s account, calling the president \u201cgracious\u201d. In an interview on CNN, Biden said he told the president that leadership was about \u201ctaking responsibility\u201d and then \u201claid out what I thought he should be doing\u201d.</p> <p>Any such goodwill was short-lived. By Wednesday evening, Trump had returned to the playbook he employed against Hillary Clinton to devastating effect. From the presidential podium, he slung all manner of insults an innuendo, referring to his rival as \u201cSleepy Joe\u201d and raising suspicion without reason as to why Barack Obama had withheld his endorsement during the primary. Obama has made clear that he would not get involved in the election until a nominee was chosen.</p> <p>Biden also recently spoke to Sanders by phone to let him know he was beginning to vet potential running mates. He told Sanders that he felt it was \u201cpresumptuous\u201d to move forward with the selection process while his rival remained in the race, but believed it was something that could not wait any longer.</p> <p>Biden likely won\u2019t amass the delegates to win the nomination until June. And then the coronavirus has thrown into doubt whether the party will be able to hold its convention in Milwaukee, where Biden would formally accept the Democratic nomination. The event was postponed from July to August, but Biden recently suggested that it may have to be a \u201cvirtual\u201d if the outbreak has not subsided by then.</p> <p>National Democrats, haunted by the bitter fallout from the 2016 primary, were encouraged by Biden\u2019s victory. In a string of consecutive victories, Biden built a broad coalition of African American voters, suburban women and working-class white people, winning key midwestern contests that Clinton lost four years ago. Now Biden faces the task of unifying the party, particularly the young, progressive voters who remain deeply skeptical of his candidacy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"85db80c86d05e1124d29f1844b66d6d302b52b45\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85db80c86d05e1124d29f1844b66d6d302b52b45/0_139_4200_2521/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Biden has struggled to create grassroots appeal like Bernie Sanders.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Biden has struggled to create grassroots appeal like Bernie Sanders.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brittany Hosea-Small/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In his remarks on Wednesday, Sanders re-committed to vigorously campaign on Biden\u2019s behalf, even though he would nonetheless keep his name on the ballots in an effort to influence the Democratic platform and continue to elevate his message. It remains an open question how the former rivals will campaign together and whether Sanders will leverage his massive list of small-dollar donors to fundraise for Biden, who has struggled to create a comparable grassroots appeal.</p> <p>There are limits to Sanders\u2019 ability to deliver his followers, particularly the independents most drawn to his anti-establishment rhetoric. In 2016, surveys estimate that roughly <a href=\"https://twitter.com/b_schaffner/status/900123391155482624\">1 in 10 </a>Sanders supporters voted for Trump, while others backed a third party candidate. The president on Wednesday <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1247914464319504385\">invited</a> \u201cthe Bernie people\u201d to join him, pointing to issues like trade as an area of common ground between Trump and Sanders.</p> <p>Hours after ending his campaign, Sanders outlined how Biden could win over his supporters in an appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s not going to adopt my platform,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI got that, alright? But if he can move in that direction, I think people will say: \u2018You know what, this is a guy I think who we should support and would support.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Already progressive groups are weighing in, outlining demands and concessions that hope to see from Biden in exchange for their active support of his campaign.</p> <p>\u201cExclusively anti-Trump messaging won\u2019t be enough to lead any candidate to victory,\u201d a coalition of youth-led groups wrote in an open letter to Biden. \u201cWe need you to champion the bold ideas that have galvanized our generation and given us hope in the political process.\u201d</p> <p>Aware of the consequences of disunity, Biden has aggressively stepped up his outreach to progressive groups in recent weeks and has already made overt gestures, adopting policy proposals championed by his leftwing rivals.</p> <p>In a lengthy statement that praised Sanders for his \u201cpassionate advocacy\u201d, Biden appealed directly to his legions of dedicated supporters.</p> <p>\u201cI see you. I hear you, and I understand the urgency of what it is we have to get done in this country,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope you will join us.

  "<p>Realism in rugby has gone viral in the last month.

No wonder the club was sold for \u00a31.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/07/premiership-set-for-extended-break-before-resuming-behind-closed-doors\">Premiership set for extended break with contingency plans to finish season</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe do not want to come back in and carry on with the same model that repeats the errors of the past,\u201d said the RFU chief executive, Bill Sweeney. \u201cWhen you have a crisis of this scale, and I do not think anyone predicted this magnitude, it highlights where there are fault lines. Some are being exposed now.\u201d</p> <p>The game in Europe went into the professional era 25 years ago sleepwalking but the south was more alert. Wealthy entrepreneurs in England and France saw an opportunity and took over clubs, quickly finding themselves on a collision course with their unions when there was not even a distant prospect of turning a profit. All that has changed since are running costs owing to an explosion in wages.</p> <p>\u201cWe are all acutely aware that from present adversity new opportunity could, and very much should, be born,\u201d said the Welsh Rugby Union chairman, Gareth Davies. \u201cStreamlining our playing calendar and balancing up the need for revenue generation have long been issues facing our sport.</p> <p>\u201cWe need each other more than ever to resolve this conundrum and all rugby playing nations should now realise the extent to which we are interdependent. The end result should be a truly global international calendar. Unity is not only the key to survival but long-term prosperity.\u201d</p> <p>Premiership Rugby this week repeated its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/07/premiership-set-for-extended-break-before-resuming-behind-closed-doors\">desire to complete the season</a> and fulfil commercial contracts but it will be a long time before normal life resumes. Even if the restrictions on large gatherings were relaxed sooner rather than later, would there be a demand for big-capacity sporting events amid fears of a renewed outbreak of Covid-19? Social distancing will take on a voluntary nature and there appears to be more chance of next season being affected than a resumption any time soon.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"468f063c2293813218765e444586cda07e83efd4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/468f063c2293813218765e444586cda07e83efd4/79_0_3389_2033/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bernard Laporte has floated the idea of a global club rugby championship.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bernard Laporte has floated the idea of a global club rugby championship.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pascal Rossignol/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The financial squeeze will become greater and when rugby is played again Test matches will have priority because they are the sport\u2019s commercial driver. The south faces losing its incoming tours: if that happened, Europe\u2019s autumn schedule would need to be revamped and revenue shared, a subject the north has consistently refused to address.</p> <p>As Davies said, all the unions are in it together and they have an opportunity to assert their authority together, as they should have done in 1995. This week the French Rugby Federation president, Bernard Laporte, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/06/club-world-cup-to-be-put-forward-as-radical-new-rugby-union-competition\">floated the idea of a world club championship</a>, a more exclusive version of the Champions Cup.</p> <p>It was not something he had suddenly dreamed up. Laporte is running on a ticket with the World Rugby chairman, Bill Beaumont, who is up for re-election next month. Laporte is bidding to become his deputy and the governing body\u2019s plan for a nations league, which was scuppered by some of the Six Nations last year, still has legs.</p> <p>The planned divisions below the Rugby Championship and the Six Nations are being organised, providing a pathway for second- and third-tier nations. The European unions are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/mar/02/six-nations-not-ruling-out-300m-paywall\">in talks with the private equity company CVC </a>about taking a 15% stake in their business in return for \u00a3300m.</p> <p>There will be a temptation, with all the unions predicting substantial losses this year, to snatch the \u00a350m+ each would receive but how far would it go after debts had been absorbed? The Premiership clubs last year received \u00a312.5m each after selling a 27% stake to CVC, which means they will each receive around \u00a31.5m less from central funds each year at a time when enhanced television and sponsorship deals will be tough to negotiate.</p> <p>The nations league promised a substantial increase in turnover for unions with all the money raised going to the game and none to speculators whose concern was the bottom line. Put together with Laporte\u2019s proposal, it would allow all the tier one unions to contract their leading players, relieving some of the financial burden on clubs in France and England.</p> <p>The clubs would resist the move. Owners have put a significant amount into the domestic game with a consequent rise in playing standards and facilities but wage inflation means the business as a whole is losing some \u00a350m a year, a figure that will rise. The \u00a37m salary cap will be reviewed after the start of the season but it will need to come down rather than go up.</p> <p>The playing calendar in Europe is a compromised mish-mash, a product of the drive for cash, which serves neither club nor country well. It cannot survive the current crisis and unions will never have a better opportunity to force change. The game needs them to seize the moment.</p> <ul> <li><p><em><strong>This is an extract from our weekly rugby union email, the Breakdown.

  "<p>Vladimir Putin has taken a backseat in tackling Russia\u2019s coronavirus outbreak, working remotely from his residence in the Moscow suburbs and delegating powers that he has spent a generation mostly accumulating in the Kremlin.</p> \n<p>Strict <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/moscow-coronavirus-lockdown-stay-indoors-city\">quarantine measures</a> and border closures have been imposed by trusted lieutenants including the Moscow mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, and the new prime minister, Mikhail Mishustin, with officials leading parallel efforts to contain the virus and its economic fallout.</p> \n<p>Putin, meanwhile, has mainly focused on cushioning the financial blow to Russians during teleconferences or in televised speeches from an empty office, a difficult perch from which to appear to be managing a crisis that he has seemed keen to hand off.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"7a6078f6-5a66-4d3e-9339-5610fe320767\" data-atom-type=\"qanda\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Qanda\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>The World Health Organization is recommending that people take simple precautions to reduce exposure to and transmission of the coronavirus, for which there is no specific cure or vaccine.</p>\n    <p>The UN agency&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public\">advises</a>&nbsp;people to:</p>\n    <ul>\n     <li>Frequently wash their hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or warm water and soap</li>\n     <li>Cover their mouth and nose with a flexed elbow or tissue when sneezing or coughing</li>\n     <li>Avoid close contact with anyone who has a fever or cough</li>\n     <li>Seek early medical help if they have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, and share their travel history with healthcare providers</li>\n     <li>Advice about face masks varies.

Businesses have clamoured for more government aid, including a release of Russia\u2019s financial reserves.</p> \n<p>\u201cStop waiting for some mythical Putin to come and save you,\u201d said Yevgenia Albats, the editor of the independent New Times magazine, when asked about aid on the popular Echo of Moscow radio station this week. \u201cOnly you can do it,\u201d she said.</p> \n<p>Putin has avoided public gatherings since late March, days after donning a yellow safety suit to visit Moscow\u2019s main hospital for coronavirus patients. While there, he shook hands and spoke with the head doctor later diagnosed with the disease. The Kremlin has said that Putin is not sick and is working remotely, but the encounter raised questions of whether Russia\u2019s president was also self-isolating, following other leaders such as Angela Merkel and Justin Trudeau.</p> \n<p>On Wednesday, Putin gave a publicly televised speech calling for bonuses for nurses and doctors caring for Covid-19 patients, and calling the next two to three weeks \u201cdecisive\u201d in Russia\u2019s battle with the disease.</p> \n<p>Calling upon Russians to unite, Putin compared the country\u2019s fight with coronavirus to battles with enemies from the 10th and 11th centuries, an eccentric choice that left many Russians searching the Internet.</p> \n<p>\u201cDear friends!\u201d he said. \u201cEverything passes, and this too will pass. Our country has repeatedly passed through serious tests: the Pechenegs tormented it, and the Cumans too. Russia defeated all of them. We will also defeat this coronavirus infection. Together we will overcome everything.\u201d</p> \n<p>The appeal to unity came at an important moment, as Putin\u2019s previous addresses had fallen flat. After he introduced a \u201cnon-working week\u201d in late March, Russians flocked to barbecues in local parks, leading Moscow\u2019s mayor to introduce a tough self-isolation regime, emphasising it was not a holiday.</p> \n<p>Other Kremlin reports of Putin\u2019s activities have been even stranger.
