  "<p>White nationalist hate groups in the US have increased 55% throughout the Trump era, according to a new <a href=\"https://www.splcenter.org/year-hate-and-extremism-2019\">report</a> by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), and a \u201csurging\u201d racist movement continues to be driven by \u201ca deep fear of demographic change\u201d.</p> <p>Nationally, there were 155 such groups counted last year, and they were present in most states. These groups were counted separately from Ku Klux Klan groups, racist skinheads, Christian Identity groups, and neo-Confederate groups, all of which also express some version of white supremacist beliefs.</p> <p>Since the turn of the millennium, the report says, \u201cAmerican racists have fretted over what they fear will be the loss of their place of dominance in society\u201d as its racial composition changes.</p> <p>The report notes that the perpetrator of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/aug/04/el-paso-shooting-white-nationalist-supremacy-violence-christchurch\">massacre</a> on 3 August 2019 in El Paso, Texas, where 26 were killed, and another man who attacked a synagogue in Poway, California, killing one woman and wounding three more, claimed to be motivated by the idea that white people were being replaced.</p> <p>The increase in hate groups includes many which openly advocate violence, terrorism and murder, and \u201caccelerationist\u201d groups \u201dwho believe mass violence is necessary to bring about the collapse of our pluralistic society\u201d, including organizations like the Base, Atomwaffen Division, and Feuerkrieg Division, according to the report.</p> <p>Seven members of the Base, six members of Atomwaffen Division, and one man, Richard Tobin, who is allegedly a member of both groups, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/06/neo-nazi-arrests-deals-blow-us-group-atomwaffen-division\">have been arrested</a> since last October on charges including firearms offenses, conspiring to vandalize synagogues and conspiracy to murder.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/06/neo-nazi-arrests-deals-blow-us-group-atomwaffen-division\">Sweep of arrests hits US neo-Nazi group connected to five murders</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In January, the Guardian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/25/inside-the-base-neo-nazi-terror-group\">showed the inner workings</a> of the Base, including the lead-up to the synagogue vandalism allegedly coordinated by Tobin, and also <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jan/23/revealed-the-true-identity-of-the-leader-of-americas-neo-nazi-terror-group\">revealed</a> that the group\u2019s founder was a Russia-based former security contractor, Rinaldo Nazzaro.</p> <p>According to the SPLC report, the arrests are evidence that federal agencies are finally \u201chearing the alarm bells\u201d regarding violent white nationalism.</p> <p>It points out that in the last year, \u201cthe FBI upgraded its assessment of the threat posed by racially motivated extremists to a \u2018national threat priority\u2019\u201d, and the \u201cDepartment of Homeland Security (DHS) announced a strategic shift toward countering racial hatred\u201d.</p> <p>But the report says that those efforts are hampered by senior members of the Donald Trump administration like Trump aide Stephen Miller, \u201cwho has long been allied with anti-immigrant hate groups\u201d.</p> <p>Miller\u2019s attempts to insert white nationalist talking points into rightwing news website Breitbart\u2019s coverage of the 2016 election were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/nov/12/trump-adviser-stephen-miller-white-nationalist-agenda-breitbart\">exposed</a> last year, but the administration has retained him in his senior role.</p> <p>While the report concludes the overall number of hate groups dipped 8% on 2018\u2019s record numbers, it says that this \u201cdoes not reflect a significant diminishment of the radical right\u201d, and that other kinds of hate groups continue to grow in number.</p> <p>Along with the increase in white nationalist groups, there was an increase in homophobic and transphobic organizations, with anti-LGBTQ groups increasing 43% in 2019. Many of those highlighted in the SPLC report are religious fundamentalists.</p> <p>The report calls for a \u201cnational movement against hate violence in America\u201d in defense of \u201cinclusive democracy\u201d.</p>",
  "<p>Donald Trump has announced the US will close its border with Canada to \u201cnon-essential traffic\u201d in an attempt to curb what he again called the \u201cChinese virus\u201d, prompting further allegations of racism.</p> \n<p>In a string of tweets about the coronavirus outbreak on Wednesday, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1240271178692005889?s=20\">Trump wrote:</a> \u201cWe will be, by mutual consent, temporarily closing our Northern Border with Canada to non-essential traffic. Trade will not be affected. Details to follow!\u201d</p> \n<p>At the White House coronavirus taskforce briefing, he added: \u201cYou can only be vigilant and very professional, but it\u2019s not pertaining at this moment to trade between the two countries.\u201d</p> \n<p>In another of a series of measures on Wednesday, the US Senate overwhelmingly passed legislation providing billions of dollars to limit the damage from the coronavirus pandemic through free testing, paid sick leave and expanded safety-net spending.</p> \n<p>The bill, which was backed by Trump, now goes to him to be signed into law. Congress and the White House are discussing additional stimulus measures that could cost more than $1tn.</p> \n<p>Earlier in the day<strong> </strong>the president also said he would invoke the Defense Production Act, aimed at getting the private sector to produce more emergency supplies. But he later appeared to walk that back, saying he\u2019d only signed an executive order signaling he\u2019d invoke the DPA \u201cshould we need to invoke it in a worse case scenario in the future.\u201d</p> \n<p>Closing the border with Canada raised fresh questions over America\u2019s southern border with Mexico but was welcomed by Canada, as health officials grapple with a surge in coronavirus cases originating in US.</p> \n<p>Canada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said: \u201cWe\u2019re encouraging people to stay home. We\u2019re telling our citizens not to visit their neighbours if they don\u2019t absolutely have to. This collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudent approach. I want to be clear though, that essential travel will continue.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trudeau was speaking outside his home in Ottawa. For nearly a week, he has been in self-quarantine after his wife, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/sophie-gregoire-trudeau\">Sophie Gr\u00e9goire Trudeau</a>, tested positive for Covid-19.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/18/steven-mnuchin-coronavirus-unemployment-treasury-secretary\">Steven Mnuchin warns coronavirus could bring 20% unemployment</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The longest undefended land border in the world, spanning more than 5,000 miles, represents a critical lifeline for both countries, with billions in goods passing through each day. The last time the border closed was in the days after the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks on New York and Washington.</p> \n<p>Trudeau added: \u201cOur governments recognise that it is critical that we preserve supply chains between both countries. These supply chains ensure that food, fuel and life-saving medicines reach people on both sides of the border.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s decision to work with Trudeau contrasted with his earlier move to ban most travel from Europe, which was abruptly announced in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/11/donald-trump-us-coronavirus-address\">a televised Oval Office address</a> and blindsided many officials.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.wilsoncenter.org/person/christopher-sands\">Christopher Sands,</a> director of the Canada Institute at the Wilson Center think tank in Washington, said: \u201cThe most significant aspect of the decision to restrict crossings at the US-Canadian border is that it was mutual, with both Washington and Ottawa taking coordinated action that allows for essential shipments and individuals to cross.\u201d</p> \n<p>The total number of known US infections has surged past 7,000, with cases reported in all 50 states. Trump has struck a more sombre and serious tone in recent days and, on Wednesday, referred to himself as a \u201cwartime president\u201d.</p> \n<p>He told reporters: \u201cTo this day, nobody\u2019s seen anything like what they were able to do during World War II. And now it\u2019s our time. We must sacrifice together, because we are all in this together, and we\u2019ll come through together.\u201d</p> \n<p>He announced the deployment of two big hospital ships to New York and the west coast to reinforce medical services, and urged young people to make \u201csacrifices\u201d for the greater good. He also announced the Department of Housing and Urban Development would suspend all foreclosures and evictions until the end of April. Mike Pence, the vice-president, urged hospitals to <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/pence-coronavirus-elective-surgeries-delay-ed3498b4-90db-429a-9046-cb8a8d0c90cf.html\">delay elective procedures</a>.</p> \n<p>But Trump raised eyebrows when he was asked about professional sportspeople without symptoms reportedly getting tests while others are waiting in line and cannot get them. A reporter asked: \u201cDo the well-connected go to the front of the line? Should that happen?\u201d Trump replied: \u201cNo, I wouldn\u2019t say so ... but perhaps that\u2019s been the story of life.\u201d</p> \n<p>The administration plans to use a health-focused statute to crack down further in swiftly removing migrants or asylum seekers who cross the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-mexico-border\">US-Mexico border</a> unlawfully.</p> \n<p>Trump said the move could happen as soon as Wednesday, but that his administration did not plan to fully close the border with Mexico.</p> \n<p>Critics have accused Trump of initially playing down the threat and providing misleading information on issues such as the availability of testing. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/donald-trump-coronavirus-politics-andrew-cuomo-gretchen-whitmer\">His claim on Tuesday</a> that \u201cI felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic,\u201d was met with widespread derision.</p> \n<p>On Wednesday the president used Twitter to defend his handling of the crisis and lashing out at media coverage. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1240243188708839424?s=20\">He posted:</a> \u201cI always treated the Chinese Virus very seriously, and have done a very good job from the beginning, including my very early decision to close the \u2018borders\u2019 from China \u2013 against the wishes of almost all. Many lives were saved. The Fake News new narrative is disgraceful &amp; false!\u201d</p> \n<p>But his brazen repetition of the phrase \u201cChinese virus\u201d in this and other tweets sparked fresh condemnation. The World Health Organization has advised against such terminology, warning that it could be \u201cstigmatising\u201d. There are fears it will fuel discrimination against Asian Americans.</p> \n<p>Asked on why he keeps using the phrase, Trump replied: \u201cBecause it comes from China. It\u2019s not racist at all, no, not at all. It comes from China, that\u2019s why, I want to be accurate\u2026</p> \n<p>\u201cI have great love for all of the people from our country but, as you know, China tried to say at one point \u2013 maybe they stopped now \u2013 that it was caused by American soldiers. That can\u2019t happen. It\u2019s not going to happen, not as long as I\u2019m president. It comes from China.\u201d</p> \n<p>But Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state defeated by Trump in the 2016 election, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/1240283608121839617?s=20\">tweeted:</a> \u201cThe president is turning to racist rhetoric to distract from his failures to take the coronavirus seriously early on, make tests widely available, and adequately prepare the country for a period of crisis.\u201d</p> \n<p>She added: \u201cDon\u2019t fall for it. Don\u2019t let your friends and family fall for it.\u201d</p> \n<p><em>Reuters contributed to this report</em></p>",

It\u2019s not <strong><em>just </em></strong>because the dollar is in massive demand. </p> <p>He writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Sterling has completed one of its steepest declines in memory by hitting its weakest level since 1985, excluding if you will the brief dive of the Oct 2016 \u2018flash crash\u2019. </p> <p>This is the worst sustained period of sterling selling that I can recall, and it points to a severe dollar liquidity crunch that central banks have yet to get a grip on. There is a synchronised rush for dollars that has caught most companies, governments and traders on the hop. Dollar funding issues have been far more serious than estimated prior to this crisis.<br></p> <p>However sterling is also sharply weaker against the euro in recent days, with EURGBP above 0.92, so whilst the main reason for the pound\u2019s decline, there are clearly other factors at work. The UK government\u2019s massive fiscal package undoubtedly means more borrowing for the UK economy - how do we pay for all this? And in a rather bizarre turn of events - if you have been schooled in the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis a few years back - the euro has developed certain safe haven characteristics. Sterling is, on the other hand, a bit of a proxy for risk.<br></p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6d9a6f877ef1ce814607886fb201720f53ac5e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6d9a6f877ef1ce814607886fb201720f53ac5e7/0_0_580_342/500.jpg\" alt=\"The pound vs the US dollar this year\" width=\"500\" height=\"295\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The pound vs the US dollar this year</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Refinitiv</span> </figcaption> </figure> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-5e720dd28f085c6327bc2310\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-18T12:04:18.508Z\">12.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>A growing number of European carmakers are downing tools, my colleague Rob Davies reports:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>BMW and Toyota have joined a rapidly lengthening list of carmakers shutting down European operations, affecting UK plants in Oxfordshire and Derbyshire, as the coronavirus brings the automotive industry grinding to a virtual halt.</p> <p>More than 10,000 car workers have been laid off across the industry as Nissan, the Mercedes-Benz parent, Daimler, Volkswagen, Ford, Fiat and Peugeot have already announced suspensions of their European output.

  "<p>The Vermont senator <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/bernie-sanders\">Bernie Sanders</a> got <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/17/2020-four-states-primaries-coronavirus-election\">thumped</a> in the latest round of Democratic presidential primary contests and, once again, Sanders and his team are reassessing their path forward.</p> <p>It\u2019s becoming a familiar cycle: former vice-president <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/joebiden\">Joe Biden</a> beats Sanders, the darling of progressive grassroots voters;<strong> </strong>the Sanders campaign concedes the situation isn\u2019t ideal, and spends some time reassessing. That\u2019s what happened earlier this month after the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2020/mar/18/joe-biden-wins-democratic-primaries-bernie-sanders-donald-trump-coronavirus-live-updates\">Super Tuesday</a> contests on 3 March, and this Tuesday night and Wednesday morning.</p> <p>On Wednesday Sanders, the campaign said, would first vote on coronavirus legislation in the Senate and then later in the day he would fly with his wife Jane back to Vermont where he would have conversations with supporters.</p> <p>\u201cThe next primary contest is at least three weeks away. Senator Sanders is going to be having conversations with supporters to assess his campaign,\u201d Sanders\u2019 campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, said in a statement. \u201cIn the immediate term, however, he is focused on the government response to the coronavirus outbreak and ensuring that we take care of working people and the most vulnerable.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2020/mar/18/democratic-primary-delegate-count-latest\">Democratic primary delegate count - latest</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Sanders campaign also sent out an email to supporters with a similarly gloomy tone.</p> <p>\u201cNo sugarcoating it, last night did not go the way we wanted,\u201d Shakir wrote in that email. \u201cAnd while our campaign has won the battle of ideas, we are losing the battle over electability to Joe Biden.\u201d</p> <p>The email did not include a usual link to make a donation to the campaign. Instead it linked to Sanders\u2019 response on how the federal government should be responding to the coronavirus pandemic, a signal that the campaign is at least slightly inching away from a relentless campaign mode.</p> <p>There were three contests on Tuesday night and Biden beat Sanders in all of them. More ominous for Sanders, Biden beat him by double digits in all three states. Biden won decisively by about 14 points in Illinois.</p> <p>In 2016, Sanders narrowly lost to former secretary of state Hillary Clinton there by less than three percentage points. In Florida, Biden beat Sanders by almost 40 percentage points. In Arizona, Sanders lost to Biden by about the same margin he lost to Clinton in 2016.</p> <p>The prospect of Sanders dropping out is so strong that for a few moments on Wednesday a report about Sanders suspending campaign ads on Facebook was misread as Sanders suspending his campaign.</p> <p>The next set of contests are in states that were more favorable to Sanders in 2016 \u2013Hawaii and Alaska, in particular. But the larger problem for the Vermont senator is the delegate math. As of Wednesday Biden led Sanders by 1,153 pledged delegates to 874. Even before Tuesday, Sanders would have to have won the lion\u2019s share of delegates in coming contests.</p> <p>The Biden campaign has been hesitant to declare victory outright but has argued publicly and behind the scenes that Biden\u2019s delegate advantage is unassailable.</p> <p>In a conference call with donors ahead of the Tuesday\u2019s primary results, Greg Schultz, a top adviser for the campaign, said the Biden team felt they had a \u201cvery clear delegate trajectory that would require Sanders to so overwhelmingly out-perform\u201d in the next few primary contests, according to audio obtained by the Guardian.</p> <p>On Wednesday morning, Unite the Country, a Super Pac supporting Biden, released a memo going even further.</p> <p>\u201cLast night\u2019s overwhelming victories in Arizona, Illinois and Florida are likely to add at least 150 delegates to Joe Biden\u2019s already commanding delegate lead. Even without <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/17/dnc-memo-primary-delays-could-result-delegate-reduction\">Ohio voting</a>, Joe Biden effectively ended the race last night,\u201d the memo said.</p> <p>\u201cHe will be the Democratic nominee, and for Unite the Country, the focus now turns to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-elections-2020\">November</a>. The turnout generated by the vice-president continues to surprise everyone. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/17/us-elections-voters-coronavirus\">Despite the virus</a>, total turnout in Arizona and Florida exceeded 2016 numbers, and just like in previous states this primary season, there was particularly robust turnout in the types of suburban communities where we need to show strength this fall.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d40ee9b857eda90c3c895169619554b440585287\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d40ee9b857eda90c3c895169619554b440585287/0_200_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders greet each other with their elbows at the last Democratic presidential debate, in Washington.

Because of the pandemic, Sanders\u2019 campaign cannot hold the energetic rallies that are a pillar of the campaign, Democratic strategist Julian Mulvey, who advised Sanders in 2016, said.</p> <p>\u201cPart of the difficult challenge now is they can\u2019t hold rallies. The rallies have always been, in one sense, the central part of the campaign,\u201d Mulvey said. \u201cIt\u2019s direct connection with Bernie and the grassroots and people. It\u2019s him getting on the ground, delivering his 90-minute stump speech \u2013 delivering his giant stump speech. I think it\u2019s very important for the energy on the ground, it\u2019s very important for Bernie.\u201d</p> <p>But Sanders allies and strategists from the progressive wing of the party still see value in the Vermont senator continuing the campaign.</p> <p>\u201cIn this moment of national crisis, Bernie\u2019s platform is more salient than ever: Republicans and centrist Democrats alike are suddenly echoing his calls for free healthcare, expanded paid sick leave, and unemployment insurance,\u201d progressive Democratic strategist Monica Klein said in an email to the Guardian on Wednesday.</p> <p>She added: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen from exit polls that Bernie\u2019s economic and healthcare platforms are widely supported by Democratic voters \u2013 so whoever we end up with as our nominee, the Democratic ticket needs to embrace the bold economic solutions that Bernie has championed since day one.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>Nicholas Stern, one of the most prominent global experts on the climate crisis, has urged Boris Johnson to resist calls to postpone vital UN climate talks this year, despite the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/mar/02/vital-cop26-climate-talks-could-be-derailed-by-coronavirus\">coronavirus</a> outbreak.</p> <p>Ministers and officials have privately discussed the possibility of postponing the Cop26 talks scheduled for Glasgow this November, but no decision has yet been taken. Travel bans and the shutdown imposed in many countries because of the virus have resulted in cancelled meetings and officials working remotely.</p> <p>Lord Stern believes any move to postpone the talks would put paid to any hope of making real progress. \u201cAt the moment we must just get on with the preparation,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is such an urgent challenge and there is so much to do, and so much valuable work that is being done, that we can\u2019t afford to lose the momentum.\u201d</p> <p>At Cop26 \u2013 the 26th conference of the parties \u2013 countries are supposed to come up with more stringent plans to curb greenhouse gas emissions, because current plans under the Paris agreement are inadequate. The UK was hoping to bring many countries to the table <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/03/saving-the-planet-uk-role-vital-if-cop-26-climate-talks-to-succeed\">with pledges to hit net zero carbon by 2050</a>, a target that the UK has already enshrined in law.</p> <p>Stern said work had become more difficult because of the virus, but not impossible. Postponing the summit now would effectively put the brakes on at a time when acceleration is needed, he said, and if needs be then a postponement could be discussed after the summer, depending on the situation then.</p> <p>Stern is backed by other former high-ranking diplomats. Yvo de Boer, a former chief of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), who led talks in Copenhagen in 2009 that ended in acrimony, said it was vital to keep working towards a November Cop26. \u201cIf it is going to be cancelled, that should only be done at the last possible minute \u2013 in October,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\ufeffOne former high-ranking official who helped put together the Paris agreement said: \u201cCancelling now might look like the UK was grasping too soon for a way out of an important meeting.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"89ffbc03a5b6a575d35aefa320a1aaff97813470\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/89ffbc03a5b6a575d35aefa320a1aaff97813470/0_202_6016_3611/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nicholas Stern\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nicholas Stern: \u2018We can\u2019t afford to lose the momentum.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Nicholson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some NGOs and developing country experts also view talk of postponement as counterproductive. Mohamed Adow, the director of <a href=\"https://powershiftafrica.org/\">Power Shift Africa</a> and a close observer of the talks for many years, said: \u201cWe would rather not see it cancelled until we know more about the spread of the virus. Cancelling it immediately might mean action on climate change gets ignored this year and people on the frontlines in poorer countries can\u2019t afford that.\u201d</p> <p>Janine Felson, the deputy chair of the Alliance of Small Island States, said: \u201cWe cannot afford to lose any momentum. We should all focus our energies on ensuring that we can support each other through this trying time and continue to push for ambition.\u201d</p> <p>But some experts contacted by the Guardian believe postponing the talks would provide more time for diplomacy. John Sauven, the executive director of Greenpeace UK, has written to Alok Sharma, the business secretary and president of Cop26, urging him to delay.</p> <p>He said: \u201cPostponement is very different to cancellation. It would be the same president, the same venue, the same two countries co-hosting, so all you are doing is having a slight delay. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/feb/07/mary-robinson-attacks-unhelpful-uk-over-cop-26-climate-talks\">The UK got off to a slow start</a> [in launching its strategy for hosting Cop26] so postponement would give more time for the work that is needed.\u201d </p> <p>One key issue is that the US presidential election is due to take place a week before Cop26 begins. Donald Trump is strongly opposed to the Paris agreement and his withdrawal from it will take effect the day after the election. A new president, if there is one, could be more amenable to climate action but would not take office until January, so a postponement could allow the US to participate.</p> <p>Paul Bledsoe, a strategic adviser at the Progressive Policy Institute in the US, said: \u201cOne distinct advantage of delay until spring 2021 is the growing prospect that US voters will turn Trump\u2019s climate nihilism out of office in favour of Joe Biden\u2019s robust climate ambition, infusing global negotiations with far greater importance and momentum.\u201d</p> <p>Some pre-Cop meetings are already in doubt. The UNFCCC has cancelled all meetings for the next month but a decision will have to be taken soon on an intermediate meeting set for Bonn in June. Italy is due to co-host Cop26 with the UK but its plans have been thrown into disarray by the coronavirus pandemic.</p> <p>The UK government has said there are no plans for a change. A spokesperson said: \u201cWe continue to work towards hosting the event in Glasgow in November, which is eight months away. Given this is an evolving situation we are keeping the situation under careful review.\u201d</p> <p>The UNFCCC also said there was no immediate move to postpone the talks. Any decision would have to be taken by the <a href=\"https://unfccc.int/process/bodies/supreme-bodies/bureau-of-the-cop-cmp-and-cma\">Cop Bureau</a>, made up of elected representatives from various countries, and would also involve the Chilean government, which technically will preside over the process until the UK officially takes on the presidency in November. </p>",

The duo has presented a reliable, measured and authoritative face for New Zealand\u2019s Covid-19 response.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/18/new-zealand-police-to-carry-out-spot-checks-to-ensure-tourists-self-isolate-amid-covid-19\">New Zealand police to carry out spot checks to ensure tourists self-isolate amid Covid-19</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Her trademark \u201cpolitics of kindness\u201d has also been at the forefront of her approach. On Tuesday, in her speech to parliament she pushed the message that the country needed to \u201clook after one another\u201d and \u201ccare for the most vulnerable\u201d. And she ended it by saying: \u201cMy final message is this to New Zealanders: be strong but be kind \u2013 we will be OK.\u201d</p> <p>In this current crisis, though, reassurance and kindness are not enough. The New Zealand public are worried, and rightly so. This interconnected age gives us a window on other parts of a world that are being infected before us. The plight of other nations is available to us in real time, along with what we fervently hope is not a terrifying glimpse into the future.</p> <p>For weeks now, the government has been accused of being slow off the mark on measures such as screening and testing, not learning lessons from overseas, and not seizing the advantage our relative isolation affords. Ardern has been batting away calls for more radical action to prevent the crisis escalating.</p> <p>At the weekend, Ardern showed she is capable of matching kindness with steely resolve, announcing New Zealand would \u201cgo early and go hard\u201d, with immediate border controls requiring <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/14/new-zealand-tells-arrivals-to-self-isolate-for-two-weeks-including-citizens\">all entrants to the country to self-isolate for 14 days</a> on arrival. The announcement was met with shock by some, but relief by many. The choice not to implement a harder ban, was probably influenced by the cries of overreaction that greeted Donald Trump\u2019s hard US closure to European nations days earlier. Of course, many other countries have since implemented hard travel bans, and this approach is no longer considered extreme.</p> <p>Nevertheless, it was not an easy decision to make for a country reliant on tourism \u2013 putting \u201cpeople before business\u201d will come at a huge economic cost.</p> <p>Having all but torpedoed New Zealand into a recession \u2013 albeit to save people\u2019s lives \u2013 the onus then fell on the government to do something else radical. That response came yesterday in finance minister Grant Robertson\u2019s emergency economic package, which contained <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/new-zealand-launches-massive-spending-package-to-combat-covid-19\">NZ$12.1bn of new spending</a>, or about 4% of GDP, overshadowing packages made in other countries to date.</p> <p>The boldness of this package has been widely endorsed and the finance minister, until now seen as a fiscal conservative, was able to position himself on Tuesday as something more radical and visionary. He spoke angrily of previous governments who had implemented \u201cneoliberal\u201d austerity, and cited his own influence as the original social democratic reformers of the first Labour government in the 1930s.</p> <p>The National party opposition is, for the time being, floundering, unable to navigate the new environment.</p> <p>The government has received plaudits for taking what they paint as a bold, decisive and preventative approach. Their \u201cgo hard, and go early\u201d slogan will resonate with a public keen for strong leadership. But, of course, what seems bold today might well be seen as insufficient next week, given the escalating global situation.</p> <p>Politically, so much will depend on the spread of Covid-19 in New Zealand. Should New Zealand suffer the awful fate of so many countries, then the government will be accused of doing too little, too late. If we can stem the tide of infection then Ardern will certainly be able to take much of the credit. With a general election scheduled for later this year, a lot will depend on whether the government really has gone hard and gone early.</p> <p>However, ultimately it\u2019s the economy that is more likely to determine the government\u2019s re-election chances. New Zealand voters tend to blame incumbent politicians for recessions \u2013 whether they deserve it or not.</p> <p>Most notably, in the 1930s, the first Labour government took over from United-Reform during the Great Depression. But also in the late 1980s, the share market crash helped finish off the Lange Labour government, just as the 1997 Asian financial crisis did in the Shipley National-led government, and then the Clark government was disadvantaged by the 2008 global financial crisis.</p> <p>If unemployment ends up hitting 10 or 20%, no one will remember how quickly Ardern implemented a travel ban, or how well she communicated during the coronavirus crisis. No matter how good her crisis management is in March, if the economy collapses, we could easily be looking at Prime Minister Simon Bridges in September.</p> <p>As with everything in this crisis, ultimately only time will tell.</p>",
  "<p>Joe Biden swept three key primaries in Florida, Illinois and Arizona on Tuesday night, dominating a third consecutive week of elections as he built a nearly indomitable lead in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination under the shadow of the coronavirus pandemic.</p> \n<p>His resounding victories all but eliminated a path for his rival, Bernie Sanders, whose campaign is at a crossroads as he contemplates whether to stay in a fight for the liberal agenda he has championed for decades, or to exit and help Democrats unify the party behind his opponent as the country faces a public health crisis.</p> \n<p>After the win, Biden made an overture to Sanders\u2019 supporters, as he seeks to add to his lead. Biden said he and Sanders shared common goals, regarding healthcare, inequality and the climate crisis.</p> \n<p>\u201cSo let me say especially to the young voters who have been inspired by Senator Sanders, I hear you. I know what\u2019s at stake,\u201d Biden said, in a a livestream video posted after the Florida and Illinois results were declared.</p> \n<p>\u201cI know what we have to do. Our goal as a campaign, and my goal as a candidate for president is to unify this party, and then to unify the nation.\u201d</p> \n<p>Sanders has far more support than Biden among young voters, who are more likely to be skeptical of Biden\u2019s incremental approach.<strong> </strong></p> \n<p>Biden\u2019s victories came as Donald Trump formally sealed the Republican presidential nomination, surpassing the necessary delegate threshold after facing no significant opposition.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/16/joe-biden-woman-vice-president-abrams-harris-klobuchar-warren\">Joe Biden's pledge to name a woman as running mate fires speculation</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Tuesday\u2019s elections underscored the uncertainty surrounding the Democratic presidential primary amid a global outbreak that has closed borders, roiled the economy and touched nearly every corner of public life. Ohio, which was also due to vote on Tuesday, postponed its elections, defying a court order and closing polls, even as Florida, Illinois and Arizona moved forward despite pressure to delay their contests.</p> \n<p>Before polls closed on Tuesday, Sanders delivered an address responding to the public health and economic crisis caused by the coronavirus outbreak. He predicted the US government would ultimately spend $2tn \u201cto prevent deaths, job losses and to avoid an economic catastrophe\u201d and called for every American household to receive monthly payments of $2,000 during the crisis.</p> \n<p>\u201cOur country and our world are facing an unprecedented series of crises,\u201d he said in remarks that made no reference to the election.</p> \n<p>More than 6,300 Americans have tested positive for the virus, despite limited testing, with 108 deaths <a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">as of Tuesday evening</a>. The message from officials is that the outbreak will worsen dramatically.</p> \n<p>On Monday, Trump advised Americans not to gather in groups of more than 10, further restricting guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which recommended that no gatherings with 50 people or more be held for the next eight weeks.</p> \n<p>Against that backdrop, Mike DeWine, the Republican governor of Ohio, announced on Monday afternoon that he would seek to postpone the election until 2 June. Hours later an Ohio county judge rejected the request, saying it would set a \u201cterrible\u201d precedent.</p> \n<p>DeWine instructed the state\u2019s director of health to declare a public health emergency. He argued that holding the election would place voters and poll workers in potential danger.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe should not force people to make this choice, a choice between their health and their constitutional rights and their duties as American citizens,\u201d DeWine said at a press conference, adding: \u201cI think when we look back on this, we are going to be glad we did this.\u201d</p> \n<p>Tom Perez, chairman of the Democratic National Committee, assailed the move for causing \u201cmore chaos and confusion\u201d and sought to discourage other states from following suit.</p> \n<p>But it may be too late. Louisiana and Georgia were the first states to announce they would delay their primaries in response to the outbreak. Kentucky joined Ohio on Monday, choosing to delay its primary from 19 May to 23 June. And on Tuesday, Maryland became the fifth state to postpone its presidential primary election, moving it from 28 April to 2 June.</p> \n<p>Officials in Florida, Arizona and Illinois took additional precautions to ensure the safety of voters and poll workers, including sanitizing voting machines and offering curbside voting. But there were reports of poll worker shortages and confusion over polling locations.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"9cd86439-9730-4d31-9420-04159eb9e36f\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QbhWz5QD6R8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The virus has reshaped the 2020 election campaign in other ways. Trump is not holding his signature rallies and the Democratic candidates, both in their late 70s, are forgoing big gatherings, opting instead to hold virtual town halls and live-streamed events. On the eve of the latest primaries, Sanders participated in a digital rally from his hometown of Burlington, while Biden held a \u201ctele-town hall\u201d.</p> \n<p>The election delays have added another layer of unpredictability to a primary that has seen months of twists and surprises. Simon Rosenberg, a veteran consultant and the president of the New Democrat Network and the New Policy Institute, said coronavirus presented an \u201cunprecedented\u201d challenge for the party.</p> \n<p>\u201cDemocrats now must to find a way to complete this primary given the uncertainty of when each state is going to vote and whether we\u2019re even going to be able to have a convention in July,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>Padding his delegate lead further, Biden was also finally declared the winner of last week\u2019s primary in Washington, a state Sanders hoped to win.</p> \n<p>In his remarks on Tuesday night, Biden made an explicit appeal to Sanders\u2019 loyal supporters.</p> \n<p>\u201cI hear you. I know what\u2019s at stake.

Like a lot of events, that meeting is now canceled. Powell pre-empted it by announcing an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/15/federal-reserve-cuts-interest-rates-near-zero-prop-up-us-economy-coronavirus\">unprecedented second cut</a> to interest rates on Sunday and unveiled plans to pump $700bn into the financial system.</p> <p>For many it was deja vu all over again. After the last financial crisis the Fed rode in with very similar plans and it worked, sort of. If anyone thought that the Fed could pull it off again this time, the reaction on Monday morning swiftly put paid to that. Stock markets went into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/15/markets-face-more-turmoil-as-fears-for-global-economy-grow-coronavirus\">free</a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/15/markets-face-more-turmoil-as-fears-for-global-economy-grow-coronavirus\">fall.</a></p> <p>The US has enjoyed 11 years of growth and yet interest rates have hovered close to zero since the last recession. Even when the going was good the Trump administration vigorously fought any rate rises (keen to pump up the stock markets at any cost) and Trump himself has threatened to sack Powell, who is supposed to be independent of political interference.</p> <p>The Fed\u2019s benchmark interest rate, used to set rates for everything from mortgages and car loans to savings and credit card rates, is 0% to 0.25% after the second rate cut. Powell has said he is not keen on negative rates \u2013 an Alice-in-Wonderland development that has one Danish bank actually <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2019/aug/13/danish-bank-launches-worlds-first-negative-interest-rate-mortgage\">paying borrowers</a> to take money off their hands \u2013 but it is hard to see what other tools he has.</p> <p>Yes, the Fed can pump more money into the financial system, as it did last time, but this isn\u2019t a financial crisis \u2013 at least not yet. Consumers, who make up 70% of the US economy, may get even cheaper loans but for now they have nowhere to spend it and consumer confidence is dwindling as fast as the nation\u2019s toilet paper supplies. The situation will only worsen when and if people start to lose their jobs.</p> <p>This is a crisis that will take congressional intervention to overcome. And that, frankly, is terrifying.</p> <p>It is not hard to find fault with the Fed. Full employment is one of its mandates but it is largely uninterested in what sort of jobs are created. Its mandate is to maintain the status quo, not challenge it. Now, with the Fed sidelined, we will swap a calm, independent, voice for the bellicose buffoonery of the White House and a president who has made no bones about playing favorites with the crony business leaders he wheels out at every opportunity to chorus their approval.</p> <p>The Trump administration is talking bailouts already for the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/16/us-airline-industry-seeks-50-billion-bailout-amid-coronavirus-pandemic\"> airlines</a>, hotels and others. What he can pass remains to be seen. Trump has no friends on the other side of the House and slim chance of making any. Even if he can get something approved, how effective will it be? The omens are ominous.</p> <p>If you want to imagine what a Trump bailout will look like, look no further than his 2017 tax cuts.</p> <p>\u201cThe rich will not be gaining at all with this plan,\u201d Trump promised as he pushed through the $1.7tn cuts that the, then booming, US economy neither needed and which the future could <a href=\"https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/economy/reports/2018/11/29/461579/rising-deficits-falling-revenues/\">ill afford</a>.</p> <p>The tax cuts were sold on a lie. \u201cOur focus is on helping the folks who work in the mailrooms and the machine shops of America. The plumbers, the carpenters, the cops, the teachers, the truck drivers, the pipe-fitters, the people that like me best,\u201d promised Trump.</p> <p>In fact, more than 60% of the tax savings went to the most wealthy 20%, according to the non-partisan <a href=\"https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/distributional-analysis-conference-agreement-tax-cuts-and-jobs-act/full\">Tax Policy Center</a>. Quite a number of them were <a href=\"https://publicintegrity.org/inequality-poverty-opportunity/taxes/trumps-tax-cuts/republicans-profit-congress/\">in Congress.</a></p> <p>Companies including AT&amp;T, General Motors and Wells Fargo all promised to invest in new jobs. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/10/at-and-t-layoffs-jobs-slashed-trump-tax-cuts\">Instead </a>they bought back their own shares and<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/15/job-losses-trump-tax-cut-at-t-general-motors-wells-fargo\"> laid people off.</a></p> <p>Sure, the tax cuts helped boost the 401k retirement savings plans most Americans now rely on in lieu of a pension. But the rises in share price disproportionately benefit the economic elite. The wealthiest 10% of Americans own 84% of all stocks and the top 1% of households own nearly 38% of all stock, according to <a href=\"http://www.marineconomicconsulting.com/w20733.pdf\">research by the New York University economist Edward Wolff</a>.</p> <p>The tax cuts were such a dud that <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/04/15/donald-trump-tax-cuts-unpopular-1273469\">even Republican voters</a> don\u2019t like them. Bailouts for big business as the average American struggles with the Covid-19 crisis on top of healthcare costs, student debts and persistent low wages could be political suicide for Trump. Nevertheless he will have to do something \u2013 we can\u2019t rely on the Fed any more.</p>",
  "<p>Layla Moran, the Liberal Democrat MP competing to become the party\u2019s next leader, has castigated its tactics at the last election, saying a pledge to revoke Brexit lost it the trust of voters, while Jo Swinson\u2019s talk of becoming prime minister was not seen as credible.</p> <p>Moran said the Lib Dem\u2019s national image was \u201cbroken\u201d and the party had to reconnect with voters and examine what it stood for after Brexit, or else risk \u201cbumping along with 10% support and 10 or 11 MPs for a number of years\u201d.</p> <p>The Oxford West and Abingdon MP also said that whoever becomes the new Labour leader must end the \u201cvery tribal politics\u201d between the parties and cooperate to the extent of electoral pacts.</p> <p>\u201cI think we\u2019re quite a way off from that right now,\u201d said Moran, the party\u2019s education spokeswoman, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/mar/08/layla-moran-stand-liberal-democrat-leadership\">announced her candidacy</a> just over a week ago. \u201cNevertheless, I do think that Labour need to look themselves in the eye and decide if they want to win or not.\u201d</p> <p>Her most pointed comment concerned the Lib Dems\u2019 hugely disappointing election campaign, during which the then leader, Swinson, initially <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/05/i-can-be-next-pm-says-jo-swinson-as-she-launches-election-campaign\">presented herself as a prime minister-in-waiting</a>, only to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/13/jo-swinson-lib-dems-on-course-for-grim-night\">lose her seat</a> as the party slipped to 11 MPs.</p> <p>Moran \u2013 who stresses she takes her share of responsibility for the decisions \u2013 said the ambitious stance was initially justified, but should have been changed after the Brexit party <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/nov/11/brexit-party-will-not-contest-317-tory-seats-nigel-farage-says\">stood down the bulk of its candidates</a> in favour of the Conservatives.</p> <p>\u201cThen, under the first past the post system it actually became not just unlikely, but frankly impossible that we were going to form a government, and that lost us credibility,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Moran, who is travelling the country talking to Lib Dem activists and to voters about what went wrong, also criticised the leadership\u2019s shift ahead of the party\u2019s conference last autumn to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/sep/15/lib-dems-pledge-to-revoke-brexit-without-referendum\">a policy of revoking Brexit</a> without a second referendum, albeit only in the unlikely situation of winning an absolute majority.</p> <p>There was at the time, she said, \u201ca fear that Labour was going to roll its tanks on to our turf and we needed something to be distinctive\u201d. But, she argued, the idea was pushed through the party without proper debate.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been talking to activists who say, yes, they were bounced into it, partly because the decision was made in rooms in Westminster with not enough dissenting voices before,\u201d Moran said. \u201cSo by the time it went to conference, it felt like it was a confidence motion.\u201d</p> <p>While the Lib Dems pride themselves on being a grassroots-led party, Moran said this was being lost: \u201cI\u2019m concerned, if you look at the parliamentary party makeup at the moment, we are going to be perceived as a party of the elite of London and the south-east.</p> <p>\u201cAnd that absolutely is not what I want for our party, we need to be a party for the entire country. And so, yes, we absolutely need to change the way we make policy.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1e4eb118c78e817c243113f6e9bd695365a717f0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e4eb118c78e817c243113f6e9bd695365a717f0/0_115_6268_3761/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Layla Moran visits a school with Jo Swinson during the 2019 general election campaign\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Layla Moran visits a school with Jo Swinson during the 2019 general election campaign.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The two biggest obstacles the party faced in December\u2019s election, Moran said, remained the electoral system and potential voters\u2019 distaste for Jeremy Corbyn. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t absolve us from our own responsibility for decisions that we took,\u201d she said. </p> <p>Moran refused to say which of the three candidates to succeed Corbyn she would most like to work with, but said that whoever did take over would need to not just cooperate better with other parties and embrace electoral change.</p> <p>\u201cThey need to appreciate that unless they work with us to change the electoral system it\u2019s possible that the Conservatives, particularly with the lack of strength of Labour in Scotland, are going to have a majority forever,\u201d she said. \u201cThey need to get quite pragmatic about that, in my view.\u201d</p> <p>The only other candidate to formally announce they are running for the Lib Dem leadership so far is Wera Hobhouse, the MP for Bath, although Ed Davey, who took over as interim leader after Swinson lost her seat, seems certain to do so as well. Daisy Cooper, who won <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2019/dec/11/tories-face-loss-of-st-albans-as-candidate-fails-to-impress-voters\">St Albans</a> for the party in December, is also considering joining the race.</p> <p>Nominations do not <a href=\"https://www.libdems.org.uk/leadership-timetable\">open until 1 May</a>, with voting among members not completed before mid-July.</p> <p>Moran said a key issue was developing new policy priorities, saying she had asked voters what they knew about the Lib Dems: \u201cUnfortunately, for many of them, the answer is nothing. With Brexit, they knew what we were against. But when you ask them, well, what are we for, they don\u2019t have an answer.\u201d</p> <p>Her three priorities would be to boost equality of opportunity via education, tackle the climate emergency, and work towards more collaborative politics.</p> <p>The Lib Dems, she said, still had a strong local base, with popular councillors. \u201cIt\u2019s the national brand that\u2019s broken. And in my view, that\u2019s what needs to change.\u201d</p>",

  "<h2><strong>The coronavirus crisis is upending the </strong><strong>election</strong></h2> <p>One of the four states that was supposed to hold its primary today, Ohio, postponed in-person voting to mitigate the spread of the virus, the other states employed hand sanitiser and social distancing tactics as an apparently low turnout of voters came to the polls, and Democratic candidates Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders addressed supporters virtually without an audience to avoid any kind of large gathering.</p> <h2><strong>Joe Biden\u2019s lead now looks insurmountable</strong></h2> <p>The former vice-president increased his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2020/mar/10/delegate-count-democratic-primary-2020-latest-and-calendar\">all important delegate lead</a> with sweeping victories in Florida, Illinois and Arizona.<strong> </strong>Looking at Florida alone, he appeared to be leading by about 39 points in the state, where 219 pledged delegates are up for grabs.</p> <h2><strong>Sanders is facing intensifying calls to drop out of the race</strong></h2> <p>A number of Democratic strategists have declared the nominating contest to be effectively over, and have suggested the Vermont senator should withdraw and allow Biden to focus on the November general election and the more immediate threat of the coronavirus public health emergency.</p> <h2><strong>Biden made a pitch for unity in his primary-night speech</strong></h2> <p>He called on Sanders\u2019 supporters to \u201cput politics aside\u201d. Biden said he and Sanders share a \u201ccommon vision\u201d for America, arguing all Democrats need to rally together to defeat Donald Trump and be kind to one another during the pandemic.</p> <h2><strong>Sanders addressed supporters early in the night and made no mention of tonight\u2019s primaries</strong></h2> <p>Instead, the Vermont senator focused on the proposals he would be submitting to Senate leadership to combat the coronavirus crisis and avoided discussing tonight\u2019s results, leading some to wonder if Sanders similarly sees no path forward for his campaign.</p> <h2><strong>Donald Trump is officially the Republican presidential nominee for 2020</strong></h2> <p>His win in the Florida Republican primary gave the president the delegates he needs to his party\u2019s nomination. Though he faced some challengers, none ever gained significant support, and there was almost no question that Trump would be the Republican candidate fighting the November election.</p>",
  "<p>For more than three years it seemed impossible to millions of Americans that anything could be more important than voting for an alternative to Donald Trump.</p> <p>Yet right now the US president is no longer seen as the most pressing threat to national security. The coronavirus crisis has temporarily turned the US presidential election into a sideshow.</p> <p>It was Senator Bernie Sanders who compared it in scale to \u201ca major war\u201d and suggested it may result in more casualties than the US military suffered against Germany and Japan in the second world war.</p> <p>Now Sanders, who suffered another drubbing in Tuesday\u2019s Democratic primaries in Arizona, Florida and Illinois, is facing calls to make a gesture worthy of wartime and call it quits for the national good. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/dropoutbernie?lang=en\">\u201c#DropOutBernie\u201d</a> is trending on Twitter.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/17/2020-four-states-primaries-coronavirus-election\">Biden beats Sanders in Florida and Illinois to move closer to nomination</a> </p> </aside>  <p>By throwing his weight behind Biden, the argument goes, he would in effect be doing a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/jan/03/clement-attlee-labour-leader-1963-archive\">Clement Attlee</a> \u2013 the Labour leader who agreed to serve under his rival, Conservative Winston Churchill, in Britain\u2019s coalition government when Sanders was born in 1941.</p> <p>Such a gesture would ease fears over the primary elections themselves being a public health risk \u2013 rallies are off and Ohio postponed its vote at the last minute \u2013 and enable Biden to focus on the twin priorities of the coronavirus and Trump.</p> <p>Sanders \u201cwould do public health and the party he has twice aspired to lead a big favor by acknowledging reality and leaving the race now\u201d, David Byler, a data analyst and political columnist, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/03/17/sanders-should-drop-out-democratic-primary-sake-public-health/\">wrote in the Washington Post.</a></p> <p>\u201cBy officially making former vice-president Joe Biden the presumptive nominee, Sanders would free Democrats to make more rational decisions about how and when to hold their contests, and could free voters from making an impossible choice between casting their ballots and safeguarding their health.\u201d</p> <p>Supporters of this view point to simple maths. After the results of Tuesday night, Biden is more than 300 delegates ahead of Sanders, a virtually unassailable lead. Having never won a state in his first two runs for president, 77-year-old Biden is now racking them up. The virus only strengthens his case as the restorer of order and experience in a White House currently run chaotically by a TV star.</p> <p>On Tuesday, as expected, Biden gained nearly two-thirds of the vote in the vital swing state of Florida, where Sanders\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/article241212981.html\">recent comments</a> in praise of the Cuban revolutionary Fidel Castro\u2019s literacy programme played badly. He also hammered the senator in Illinois by a bigger margin than Hillary Clinton managed in 2016, winning every county but one, and claimed Arizona to boot.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/03/joe-biden-super-tuesday-victory-democratic-primary\">It has been a stunning turnaround</a> since the dark days of Iowa and New Hampshire and is now all over bar the shouting.</p> <p>The former vice-president evidently believes so. In remarks on Tuesday night that again lacked an audience for safety reasons, he said: \u201cSenator Sanders and I may disagree on tactics, but we share a common vision \u2013 from the need to provide affordable healthcare for all Americans to reducing income inequality to taking on climate change.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cAnd let me say, especially to the young voters who have been inspired by Senator Sanders: I hear you. I know what is at stake. And I know what we have to do.\u201d</p> <p>Biden has already begun courting progressive voters by backing a version of Sanders\u2019 plan to make public colleges and universities tuition-free for many students and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/08/bernie-sanders-elizabeth-warren\">Senator Elizabeth Warren</a>\u2019s proposal to overhaul the consumer bankruptcy system.</p> <p>Yet there are still reasons to believe that Sanders will refuse to wave the white flag. He kept going last Sunday for a head-to-head debate without an audience in a TV studio in Washington. On Tuesday, even as the grim results trickled in, he released his \u201ccoronavirus crisis principles\u201d that \u201cinclude at least $2 trillion in funding to mobilize on a scale not seen since the New Deal and World War II to prevent deaths, job losses, and economic ruin\u201d.</p> <p>And no one in the Democratic party has forgotten Sanders\u2019 tenacity/obstinacy \u2013 take your pick \u2013 in 2016 when he refused to surrender against Clinton. Back then, there was always the possibility that an FBI investigation into her poor email hygiene could scuttle her candidacy. There is no such shadow hanging over Biden.</p> <p>A Sanders concession would not be simple, however. Some of his supporters never made peace with Clinton and would naturally reject Democratic National Committee pressure to wind up the election prematurely. Some are deeply sceptical of Biden as yet another centrist incrementalist who represents the past rather than the future. They will argue that not even the coronavirus should postpone the revolution.</p> <p>Two dozen other candidates have come and gone, realising when it was the right moment to leave the stage. Now all eyes are on Sanders, with many entreating him to take his final bow from presidential politics.</p> <p>The 78-year-old launched his first long-shot campaign at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/17/bernie-sanders-democratic-voters-political-revolution\">a hastily arranged press conference</a> on a patch of grass known as the Senate swamp on Capitol Hill five years ago next month. He attracted only a small group of reporters; none could have guessed what a movement he would build.</p> <p>It will be a movement in search of a new leader. And it is a movement whose support the Democratic party needs to beat Trump. The current president offers plenty of negative reasons to vote in November. Now Biden must offer enough positive ones.</p>",

The results from today\u2019s election would never be considered legitimate under normal circumstances with poll locations closing with no notification, poll workers not showing up for fear of their lives, and other locations being consolidated which all but ensures that voters in those locations will be gathered in groups larger than the 50 maximum limit suggested by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p> <p>But here we are, with a party that is so desperate to put the progressive movement down that it would risk the lives of their voters to go to the polls during a national emergency. There will be a rush to \u201cvalidate\u201d this election, but any reasonable observer engaging in good faith would confess that not postponing the primaries or, at a minimum, extending the primaries and allowing the voter to continue voting by mail constitutes voter suppression.</p> <ul> <li><p>Benjamin Dixon is the host of the Benjamin Dixon podcast</p></li> </ul> <h2>Jessa Crispin: \u2018Welcome to voting in time of social distancing\u2019</h2> <p>All day, there were reports of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/madeleinedupre/status/1239898696227094528\">primary</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rachel_joyy/status/1239963191972511746\">voting</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sebaasilv/status/1239983086668046337\">mishaps</a>. Polling places were not open, workers and volunteers did not show up, and there did not seem to be safety precautions in place in several locations to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Talking heads were saying how important it was to continue the primary process, but meanwhile, newspapers and politicians implored the citizenry to <a href=\"https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/gov-pritzker-reiterates-plea-for-people-to-stay-home-due-to-coronavirus/2237275/\">STAY HOME</a>. Kind of getting some mixed messages here, guys. I don\u2019t know if Chicago should have forced everyone who showed up to the St Patrick\u2019s Day pub crawls to man the polls, but probably we should have had some sort of Plan B procedure for voting during a national state of emergency.</p> <p>So basically, why are we doing this? And why are we pretending the results today are real and full?</p> <p>But even before the pandemic, we saw terrible voting conditions for months. States like Texas <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/02/texas-polling-sites-closures-voting\">closed hundreds of polling stations</a>, making voters wait for hours in line.

Indeed, the Delaware Democrat captured the votes of white people without college degrees, a prize that eluded Clinton and a bloc Donald Trump calls his own.

The postponement of the</p> <p>Ohio primary means we have been denied another opportunity to assess Biden\u2019s strength in the Midwest.</p> <p>Extensive early voting and vote-by-mail options allowed turnout in Florida to actually rise on 2016, which seems to bode well for Democratic enthusiasm in the general election \u2013 especially if we assume that turnout would have been even higher without coronavirus fears.</p> <p>Had the Democratic primary still been competitive going into Tuesday\u2019s contests, serious questions could be raised about the impact of the virus on the results \u2013 and given that the answers to these questions rest on such intangibles as why turnout was down, they would be very difficult to answer.</p> <p>It is vital that the integrity and legitimacy of the November election be maintained even if the coronavirus pandemic is ongoing.

On Sunday night, in the first one-on-one debate of this campaign, the American people will have the opportunity to see which candidate is best positioned to accomplish that goal.\u201d</p> <p>Well the American people had that opportunity and they chose Joe Biden. If this is what winning the ideological debate looks like, Sanders should seriously consider debating another topic.</p> <p>The only topic the American people want to debate is the coronavirus pandemic and the severe recession that looks like the certain outcome of this quasi-national quarantine. Trump\u2019s treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/on-small-business/mnuchin-warns-virus-could-yield-20percent-jobless-rate-without-action/2020/03/17/2c8ece2e-68a3-11ea-b199-3a9799c54512_story.html\">told</a> Republican senators on Tuesday that unemployment could hit 20% if they didn\u2019t push through a huge economic stimulus as soon as possible.</p> <p>To put that into context, unemployment peaked at 10% after the financial collapse of 2008. It hit 24.9% in the Great Depression in 1933.</p> <p>Just one week ago, Bernie Sanders pledged to fight on, at a time when he was losing the delegate count by around 100 attendees of the Democratic convention. Judging from the projected vote counts on Tuesday, that delegate deficit just tripled.</p> <p>There is no reason for Sanders to stay in this race, no matter how fervent his fans and no matter how passionately he wants to advocate for his policies. He has spent the last four years advocating for those policies, pushing the Democratic party towards his ideas to remarkable effect.</p> <p>Back in the 2008 election and Barack Obama\u2019s first term, it was unthinkable to propose a public healthcare option: the defeat of Clinton\u2019s healthcare proposals was still too raw, more than a decade after they had failed. Today all the Democratic contenders proposed a public option, and Joe Biden\u2019s healthcare policies are far to the left of Obama\u2019s.</p> <p>Mission accomplished? <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/us/politics/bernie-sanders-biden-2020.html\">Apparently</a> not. Bernie\u2019s advisers say Biden hasn\u2019t done enough to unify the party, or generate voter enthusiasm.</p> <p>This is not a position supported by the primary results. Biden has won in the south and the north; the east coast and the north-west. When you win Florida by more than 60% of the vote, you\u2019ve pretty much unified the party. When you drive record turnout in the middle of a pandemic \u2013 which is frankly a reckless situation from a public health perspective \u2013 then you have reasonably generated voter enthusiasm.</p> <p>By any measure, Biden can feel confident in turning towards the general election and, more importantly, beyond that: to the historic challenge of pulling this country, and the rest of the world, out of a pandemic and global recession. It\u2019s unlikely that he will agree to another debate with Sanders.</p> <p>The pandemic is only accelerating the process that was first set in train by South Carolina\u2019s Democrats. State by state, poll by poll, Democrats \u2013 and voters in general \u2013 are saying that Biden is best placed to handle a crisis, and to unify the country. Those are not small issues at a time of multiple, historic challenges.</p> <p>Biden himself addressed the nation via live stream from his Delaware home, standing at a podium in front of two American flags. If it was indeed Biden\u2019s home, he has a strange taste in interior styling.</p> <p>Most of what Biden said was not a victory speech but the words of someone trying to reassure and rally a country being shaken to its core. \u201cTackling this pandemic is a national emergency akin to fighting a war,\u201d Biden explained. \u201cYes, this is a moment where we need our leaders to lead. But it\u2019s also a moment where the choices and decisions we make as individuals are going to collectively impact what happens.\u201d</p> <p>He praised the public officials who allowed the voting to take place while supposedly protecting public health. And he praised Bernie\u2019s young voters for their enthusiasm and commitment, urging them to rally together with his campaign. \u201cI hear you,\u201d he told them. \u201cI know what\u2019s at stake. I know what we have to do. Our goal as a campaign, and my goal as a candidate for president is to unify this party and then to unify the nation.\u201d</p> <p>He may not actually know what those young Sanders voters want \u2013 or he may not be prepared to adopt their agenda in full. But he was prepared to strike a patriotic note of national unity. \u201cThis is a moment for each of us to see and believe the best in every one of us,\u201d Biden said. \u201cTo believe in one another.\u201d</p> <p>There will surely come a time for another, younger Sanders-like leader to press for a political revolution that overhauls America\u2019s economy and social safety net. If this recession plays out like the last one, voters of all kinds will be hungrier than ever for radical change in four years\u2019 time.</p> <p>That leader may already be well-known to American voters: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez will have just turned 35 \u2013 the constitutional minimum age of a president \u2013 by the time of the next presidential election. Bernie\u2019s ideas will live on long after his presidential campaign ends, which it should do within days, if he is serious about wanting the Democrats to defeat Donald Trump.</p>",

The agreement allows EU countries to band together to use their combined purchasing power to get a good deal on vaccines and other medical supplies.</p> \n  <p>The EU executive is organising joint procurement of protective clothing for medics, including masks, as well as ventilators. The commission spokesperson said \u201ca very big majority of member states [were] interested\u201d in taking part in the joint procurement on ventilators. The British government has not revealed whether it intends to take part in any of the procurement schemes.</p> \n  <p>On Monday, the prime minister, Boris Johnson, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/mar/16/vauxhall-owner-psa-car-shuts-european-plants-amid-coronavirus-fears\">urged British industry to step forward and build 20,000 ventilators \u201cat speed\u201d</a>. The NHS has 5,900 ventilators, but might need more than three times as many in the worst-case scenario for the spread of Covid-19.</p> \n  <p>The UK will be expected to apply EU-wide restrictions on the export of medical goods outside the bloc, passed in emergency legislation on Sunday. For a period of six weeks, EU countries and the UK will have to seek approval to export critical medical supplies outside the bloc.</p> \n  <p>Later on Tuesday, EU leaders are expected to adopt a 30-day travel ban on non-EU citizens entering the union, but the commission has said restrictions will not apply to the UK. There are exemptions for residents, diplomats, healthcare workers and researchers, and people delivering goods.</p> \n  <p>The UK and <strong>Ireland</strong>, neither in the EU\u2019s Schengen passport-free travel zone, are being \u201cencouraged\u201d to enforce the travel ban.</p> \n  <p> A UK spokesperson said: \u201cThe UK can choose whether to opt in to this proposal if it is agreed.

Our first priority is non-negotiable: to save lives,\u201d he told Greeks in a televised speech from his Maximos office. \u201cThat is why, much earlier than other European countries, we enforced measures that are unprecedented in peacetime. And we are continuing in that direction.\u201d </p> \n  <p>So far, Greek health authorities have announced 387 confirmed cases of coronavirus, revealing this afternoon that a fifth person had fallen victim to Covid-19. There were 35 new cases in the last 24 hours, the health ministry spokesman and infectious disease expert professor Sotiris Tsiodras told reporters. Of the total number, 11 were in intensive care, he said. </p> \n  <p>Fearing the fate of Italy, the centre-right government has threatened to be merciless with those who flout tough restrictions that as of Wednesday will also include all shops being closed across Greece, with the exception of supermarkets. Banks, pharmacies, pet-stores, mobile phone stores, opticians, bakers, mini-markets, couriers and food delivery outlets are among the few that will also be allowed to remain open. </p> \n  <p>After nearly a decade of hard-hitting austerity \u2013 measures that hurt the health system in particular \u2013 Greek officials worry that hospitals would be rapidly overwhelmed if the outbreak required untold numbers needing intensive care. <br></p> \n  <p>Mitsotakis said the resources of private clinics would also be tapped during the health crisis and that with their help 1,900 additional beds would be available for coronavirus patients. </p> \n  <p>The government had three goals: containing the disease\u2019s spread, bolstering the health system and weighing in with support for workers as the economy feels the effect of the crisis. </p> \n  <p>Hinting that people\u2019s lives were likely to be put on hold for at least two months, Mitsotakis said: \u201cThe dangers will multiply over the next two months and because of that other new restrictions will follow. We must all show discipline. Whoever behaves in an antisocial manner will face exemplary punishment because they will have committed a double crime against the law and against life.\u201d </p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-17T16:43:49.708Z\">at 4.43pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e70fc588f085e564ad85dd9\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-17T16:36:12.876Z\">4.36pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Center Parcs has said it is closing all its <strong>UK</strong> villages from Friday.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/CenterParcsUK/status/1239917366659747841\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">In light of the latest government advice regarding coronavirus, the decision has been taken to close all of our UK villages from 20 Mar - 16 April 2020. 1/4</p>\u2014 Center Parcs UK (@CenterParcsUK) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CenterParcsUK/status/1239917366659747841?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 17, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-17T16:36:26.156Z\">at 4.36pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e70f9f58f085c6327bc1ac5\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-17T16:26:03.217Z\">4.26pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>Brazil</strong> has reported its first confirmed death from the coronavirus outbreak, as Congress cancelled a joint session due to a lack of quorum and the country braced for the mounting epidemic, reports Reuters.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e70f95a8f085c6327bc1ac0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-17T16:23:24.871Z\">4.23pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Natural History Museum has closed its buildings in South Kensington and Tring.</p> \n  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NHM_London/status/1239889345185751041\"> \n   <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n    <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Following UK Government advice to limit the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Museum will be closed from 13.00 today, Tues 17 March.<br>Read our full statement below or visit the website for more details.<br>Thank you for your ongoing support, patience and understanding.<a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/COVID2019?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#COVID2019</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/GgjiPyaGfj\">pic.twitter.com/GgjiPyaGfj</a></p>\u2014 Natural History Museum (@NHM_London) \n    <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NHM_London/status/1239889345185751041?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 17, 2020</a>\n   </blockquote> \n  </figure> \n  <p>A statement said: \u201cWe are disappointed to have to delay welcoming you to the exciting exhibitions and events which we have planned, but the most important thing for us is the welfare of our visitors, supporters, staff and volunteers.</p> \n  <p>\u201cWe currently expect to reopen in early summer but until then we will continue online with our mission to create advocates for the planet so that in the future both people and the planet thrive.

Its main challenge is how to mass produce it, and at speed, company bosses told journalists. Trials of the drug, which are necessarily thorough, including checking its efficacy and potential side effects, mean that even if approved, it is not likely to be available until next spring.</p> \n  <p>It spent the first 15 minutes, though, attempting to quash the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/15/trump-offers-large-sums-for-exclusive-access-to-coronavirus-vaccine\">reports</a> in recent days according to which the company had been approached by the US government with an offer to exclusively buy up the vaccine it is working on, for one billion dollars. </p> \n  <p>First, to those rumours, the companies managers said they were just that. They categorically denied there was any truth in them, explaining that company bosses had been invited at extremely short notice to visit the White House last week, and speak to US government officials, along with representatives of other international companies working on coronavirus vaccines. This is despite the fact that the German interior minister, foreign minister, even the chancellor, Angela Merkel, and the owner of CureVac, Dietmar Hopp, had commented on the reports as if they had been true, saying that \u201cGermany is not for sale\u201d. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThis technology (to make the vaccine) can be applicable for anyone and there have not been requests for us to do it exclusively for the US,\u201d CureVac\u2019s deputy CEO Franz-Werner Haas told journalists. \u201cWe did not talk to Maas (the foreign minister) or Seehofer (the interior minister) so we cannot comment on that.\u201d</p> \n  <p>CureVac is a 20 year old company which develops therapies based on the molecule messenger RNA (mRNA) and has specialised in developing vaccines for infectious diseases as well as on drugs to treat cancer. Mariola Fotin-Mletczek, PhD, chief technology officer, explained the vaccine technology she is currently working on. \u201cNature has very good mechanisms for fighting against pathogens - viruses and bacteria - and with our technology we mimic nature\u2019s approach,\u201d she said. \u201cThe way we formulate this messenger molecule means it mimics this virus situation. </p> \n  <p>This means that we induce the immune response which is very similar to the natural immune response. With our approach, messenger RNA encodes one specific protein from the virus, the critical one, which is sufficient to mobilise the immune system. We do this in such a way that we use this natural mechanism which really helps to induce and to produce huge amounts of potent anti-bodies which neutralise the virus. </p> \n  <p>And that is exactly what we saw in the trial with our latest vaccine based on exactly the same technology. Also here we see that two doses of one microgram are sufficient to mobilise the immune system in the right way and to induce production of protective antibodies above the defined threshold, which means protection.\u201dShe said that laboratory trials on the vaccine would start in April and clinical trials would begin in the early summer.</p> \n  <p>The company has received an 80 million Euro grant from the European Commission in the last few days, which will enable it to \u201caccelerate the upscaling of a manufacturing unit which would produce the vaccine which is already being built,\u201d according to Florian von der M\u00fclbe, chief production officer and co-founder of CureVac. </p> \n  <p>This means once it got the go-ahead, the company could potentially produce high quantities of the drug so that it could be made available worldwide. The production facilities could be replicated easily elsewhere, increasing the efficiency and speed with which it could be made available, he added.</p> \n  <p>Lothar Wieler, president of the Robert Koch Institute, the main public health body in Germany, said earlier today, the concept was based on tumour therapy, with the vaccine \u201creacting to the protein in the virus and receiving an answer from it\u201d. It is a technology already used to fight cancers, he said. \u201cIf it works, it would be amazing,\u201d he said, calling the technology \u201cfast, cheap and efficient\u201d. But based on current information, and he would not expect a vaccine to be ready until next spring.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e70ee018f085e564ad85d05\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/benquinn\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-17T15:39:53.572Z\">3.39pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">Summary</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/coronavirus-france-on-war-footing-as-europe-locks-down-macron\">\u2022 The EU is set to endorse the strictest travel ban in its history as France joined Italy and Spain in full lockdown and Donald Trump told Americans to change their behaviour, acknowledging for the first time that beating the coronavirus could take months.</a><br>EU leaders are expected on Tuesday to suspend all travel into the passport-free Schengen zone by non-EU nationals for at least 30 days in a bid to instil uniformity across the bloc after some member states, including Austria, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland, unilaterally began imposing border checks.<br></p> \n  <p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/trump-calls-covid-19-the-chinese-virus-as-rift-with-coronavirus-beijing-escalates\">\u2022 Donald Trump has referred to the coronavirus as \u201cthe Chinese virus\u201d, escalating a deepening US-China diplomatic spat over the outbreak.</a></strong><br>After giving an address on Monday warning of a possible recession, the US president posted on Twitter: \u201cThe United States will be powerfully supporting those industries, like Airlines and others, that are particularly affected by the Chinese Virus.

Greek Orthodox Church suspended daily services.</strong> Against a backdrop of incredulity and consternation, the Greek Orthodox church has, if reluctantly, decided to suspend daily services after a marathon session of its Holy Synod, citing the need to prevent the spread of Coronavirus.</li> \n   <li><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/come-back-monday-ok-hundreds-of-prisoners-escape-in-brazil-amid-covid-19-anger\">Hundreds of prisoners escaped</a> from prisons in S\u00e3o Paulo state</strong> in the South East of Brazil on Monday. </li> \n   <li><strong>Amazon.com Inc on Monday said it would </strong><strong>hire 100,000 warehouse and delivery workers</strong> in the United States to deal with a surge in online orders, as many consumers have turned to the web to meet their needs during the coronavirus outbreak. </li> \n   <li><strong>All cricket in Australia has been cancelled</strong>, including the Sheffield Shield final, with NSW declared champions.</li> \n   <li><strong>US president Donald Trump has posted a tweet referring to Covid-19 as \u201cthe Chinese Virus\u201d. </strong>Trump also warned that social upheaval caused by the outbreak <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/16/trump-coronavirus-guidelines-press-conference\">could last beyond August</a>.</li> \n   <li><strong>New Zealand announced an enormous spending package,</strong> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/17/new-zealand-launches-massive-spending-package-to-combat-covid-19\">equivalent to 4% of the country\u2019s GDP</a> in an attempt to fight the effects of Covid-19 on the country\u2019s economy, in what ministers called the most significant peace-time economic plan in the country\u2019s modern history.</li> \n   <li><strong>Californians were urged to \u2018shelter in place\u2019.</strong> San Francisco and five other Bay Area counties in California have ordered all residents to shelter-in-place to curb the spread of coronavirus, in a drastic move similar to ones taken in Italy, Spain and China, but the first of its kind in the US. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/16/shelter-in-place-california-coronavirus-bay-area-explained\">Here is what the order means</a>. </li> \n   <li><strong>The Ohio primary was ordered to be delayed on health grounds.</strong> The state\u2019s governor, Mike DeWine, had recommended on Monday that in-person voting during Tuesday\u2019s primary elections be postponed.</li> \n   <li><strong>The Sydney Opera House announced it would cancel all public performances</strong> starting Tuesday, March 17. </li> \n   <li><strong>The UN Security Council called off its remaining two remaining meetings for the week</strong>, Agence France-Presse reported. </li> \n   <li><strong>China\u2019s state planner said the economy would return to normal</strong> in the second quarter, as the country reported just one case outside Wuhan. <br></li> \n   <li><strong>Australia is looking at developing a mass testing process. </strong>The country has 415 confirmed cases of coronavirus. </li> \n   <li><strong>The head of the World Health Organizaion, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, implored governments to test more suspected cases, </strong>warning that they cannot fight the pandemic blindfolded.<strong> </strong><br></li> \n   <li><strong>The White House recommended isolation.</strong> US President Donald Trump told Americans to avoid any gatherings of more than 10 people over the next 15 days and advising all states with evidence of community transmission to close down bars, restaurants, gyms and other facilities.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <p>Here is the most recent <a

Sorry to say that I, today, have tested positive for COVID19, Corona virus. My familiy and I are self-isolating at home for as long as it takes. We are in good health - I only have mild symptoms of a cold. There are people at higher risk for who this virus might be a devastating diagnosis, so I urge all of you to be extremely careful; wash your hands, keep 1,5 meters distance from others, go in quarantine; just do everything you can to stop the virus from spreading. Together we can fight this virus and avert a crisis at our hospitals. Please take care of each other, keep your distance, and stay healthy! Please visit your country&amp;#39;s Center for Disease Control&amp;#39;s website, and follow the regulations for staying safe and protecting not just yourselves, but our entire community, and especially those at risk like the elderly and people with pre-existing conditions. @grymolvaerhivju #fightcorona #solidarity #takecare #folkehelseinstituttet Thanks to @panoramaagency</a></p> <p style=&quot;
