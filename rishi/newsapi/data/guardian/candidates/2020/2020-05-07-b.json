The public health agency was halting its twice-weekly briefings, he added.</p> \n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s clear this virus cannot be eradicated in Germany,\u201d Schaade said. \u201cThere\u2019s consensus on that, at least until there\u2019s a vaccine or a treatment. We will have to try to build this virus into our everyday lives, changing our behaviour to reduce its transmission. We find ourselves in a new normality.\u201d</p> \n<p>In <strong>Spain</strong>, the director of public health for the Madrid region resigned, apparently in protest at the regional government\u2019s decision to seek to loosen lockdown restrictions in the area of<strong> </strong>the country hardest hit by the coronavirus. Yolanda Fuentes was understood to have had grave reservations about moving to \u201cphase 1\u201d, which includes the reopening of small businesses, and restaurant and bar terraces at 30% capacity.</p> \n<p>The <strong>World Health Organization</strong> said alcohol and drug abuse had combined with close confinement during weeks of lockdown to fuel alarming levels of domestic violence in many countries. Its regional director for Europe, Hans Kluge, cited reports from many countries including <strong>Belgium</strong>, <strong>Bulgaria</strong>, <strong>France</strong>, <strong>Ireland</strong>, <strong>Russia</strong>, <strong>Spain</strong> and the<strong> UK</strong> of increases in violence against women, men and children.</p> \n<p>\u201cAlthough data is scarce, member states are reporting up to a 60% increase in emergency calls by women subjected to violence by their intimate partners in April this year compared to last\u201d and online inquiries had increased fivefold, Kluge said on Thursday. \u201cThe legacy of this pandemic could haunt us for years,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>The <strong>World Tourism Organization,</strong> another UN agency, said international tourist arrivals could slump by between 60 and 80% in 2020. Widespread travel restrictions and the closure of airports and national borders to curb the spread of the virus have plunged the sector into its worst crisis since records began in 1950.</p> \n<p>Reinforcing the point, France\u2019s tourism minister, Jean-Baptiste Lemoyne, said the country\u2019s borders would stay closed for the foreseeable future and that no one would be driving \u201cthousands of kilometres\u201d for their holidays this summer.</p> \n<p>\u201cTourism will resume by concentric circles, the driving force behind the return of tourists will be national tourism,\u201d he said. \u201cThe French will go and rediscover our land, our country, our heritage. The French will have a different kind of tourism. We still have to march the epidemic back, step by step.\u201d</p> \n<p>The<strong> Israeli </strong>government continued to relax its lockdown restrictions, going further than many countries by opening shopping centres, markets and gyms on Thursday. It also announced that preschools would restart on Sunday.</p> \n<p>As the devastating economic consequences of the crisis continued to make themselves felt, another 3 million <strong>Americans</strong> filed for unemployment benefits last week, meaning a total of 33 million have made claims in the past seven weeks.</p> \n<p>Among other developments:</p> \n<ul> \n <li><p>Coronavirus cases in <strong>India</strong> have risen past 50,000, according to the country\u2019s health ministry, with the pace of infection showing no sign of abating.</p></li> \n <li><p>A new report suggested January\u2019s <strong>Sundance film festival</strong>, the annual gathering of cinephiles in <strong>Park City, Utah</strong>, may have been a key early coronavirus hub in the US.</p></li> \n <li><p><strong>Iran</strong> said on Thursday its coronavirus outbreak was \u201crelatively stable\u201d as it announced more than 1,000 infections for a fourth straight day.</p></li> \n <li><p><strong>Poland</strong> has postponed Sunday\u2019s presidential election.

  "<p>Joe Root says England are ready to go into isolation to save this summer\u2019s Test series against the West Indies and Pakistan. That could mean the Test captain also missing the birth of his second child but he is ready to make that sacrifice for a return to live international cricket.</p> <p>With sport tentatively discussing a way back, England cricketers learned this week that a squad of up to 30 players could be chosen for a run of six Tests at the Ageas Bowl and Old Trafford from 8 July.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m optimistic about it\u201a\u201d Root told Sky Sports. \u201cIt would be a real shame if doesn\u2019t happen. The public are desperate for some live sport and the guys are missing it.\u201d</p> <p>Root is concerned about safety for all those involved and is aware of the abnormal conditions that may apply.</p> <p>\u201cThe players would be sectioned off in one part of the hotel and would be in isolation together. There would be no interaction with the media, the TV crews or even the opposition when off the pitch. We would have separate lunchrooms. It would have a different feel to it but it\u2019s probably manageable. Hopefully that is the case.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/may/07/england-players-can-contest-six-summer-tests-with-minimum-of-preparations\">England's cricketers may want warm-up matches but they do not need them | Vic Marks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If both West Indies and Pakistan were prepared to buy into this scheme England\u2019s players could be locked together for as long as nine weeks. Root, like one or two others in a likely squad who could extend to 25-30 players, is expecting a second child and would like to be at the birth but he acknowledges it would not be straightforward \u201cto move in and out of the bubble\u201d.</p> <p>There is no guarantee that West Indies will accept the proposals, given how the UK is the country most afflicted by Covid-19 in Europe. \u201cWe have just tried to present the likely environment to see if it\u2019s a possibility for them\u201a\u201d Root said.</p> <p>Root believes that the cricket should not be subjected to any unusual restrictions because of the pandemic: a wicketkeeper standing up and a crowded slip cordon, say, would have to be permitted. \u201cIf the game itself is to be compromised, then we shouldn\u2019t be going ahead,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The overriding impression is that the England players are keen on playing and this was also reflected by Mark Wood. Being locked away for two months in hotels in Southampton and Manchester overlooking a cricket ground may not be the ultimate sacrifice but Wood said: \u201cIt would be very hard but as long as the environment is safe, my family are safe and everybody else there is safe then I\u2019d be willing to do it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"58883567a3cd1fff35bf9b3f599b48a0a83d259f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/58883567a3cd1fff35bf9b3f599b48a0a83d259f/0_128_3047_1899/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Wood would be willing to stay in a hotel for two months in order to play\" width=\"1000\" height=\"623\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Wood would be willing to stay in a hotel for two months in order to play.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Siphiwe Sibeko/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cBeing away on tour for long periods you get used to it.

I\u2019ve been trying to tick over and to strengthen the area in my side \u2013 I hope the time off has helped that \u2013 and then it\u2019s a little bit of buildup back into bowling.</p> <p>\u201c I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m a Jimmy Anderson, who gets into his groove nice and easy and seems just to be at the top of his game like a magician. He seems to just rock up and hits the top of off stump.\u201d</p> <p>Wood wants to resume being the \u201csmiling assassin\u201d, a tag encouraged by England\u2019s coach, Chris Silverwood. He would certainly not expect to play every game. A rotation policy for the pacemen, so often discussed, would be implemented.</p> <p>Undoubtedly his effervescent personality would be invaluable in what may become a two-month lockdown for England\u2019s players.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4169\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Spin\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly email of editors' picks\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Spin: sign up and get our weekly cricket email.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAll the communication [with the ECB via Ashley Giles and their chief medical officer, Nick Pierce] has been really good,\u201d Wood said. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m under any pressure to play and I don\u2019t get that feeling from the others.\u201d</p> <p>However as Root noted: \u201cThere are so many moving parts in all this.\u201d As far as the West Indies series is concerned these include nine governments, one in the UK and eight in the Caribbean, who may have more important agendas to pursue.</p>",

  "<p>Before college campuses emptied out for the pandemic, students and faculty alike were demanding they be empty on one specific day: election day.</p> <p>At Loyola Marymount University in California, for example, months-long organizing by students and faculty resulted in the campus being shut down during the midterm elections in 2018 \u2013 expanding the number of student voters. Several law professors also arranged a program for<a href=\"https://www.nbclosangeles.com/local/law-students-set-to-hit-polls-on-election-day-to-answer-big-questions-and-small/49003/\"> law students to volunteer at the polls</a> and answer voters\u2019 questions.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a 16-hour day of helping people find their way at the polling location and the volunteers were definitely exhausted afterwards,\u201d said Christopher Kissel, a third-year law student at Loyola. \u201cWe really saw how the democratic sausage is made, and it isn\u2019t always pretty, and it definitely isn\u2019t easy.\u201d</p> <p>While some campuses in the US do shut down during elections, most do not.

As the number of young, liberal voters continues to rise, some have raised suspicions that keeping students in class on election day is<a href=\"https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2019/11/12/students-across-country-faced-voting-barriers-election-day\"> a form of voter suppression</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/evangerstmann/2020/03/15/the-votes-of-college-students-are-being-suppressed/#1f0823b949ca\">Republican politicians</a> have been trying to limit student votes for years. In Texas, a 2019 law that prohibits temporary voting locations <a href=\"https://www.texastribune.org/2019/10/10/texas-temporary-voting-access-young-rural-voters/\">denied many college voters proper voting access</a>. In Florida, the state legislature added a parking restriction clause to a new elections law, which <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/24/us/voting-college-suppression.html\">in effect disqualified many college campuses</a> from being considered valid early polling sites. A New Hampshire law <a href=\"https://www.citizenscount.org/issues/student-vote\">requires college students</a> to obtain in-state driver\u2019s licenses to be able to vote, though the American Civil Liberties Union <a href=\"https://www.necn.com/news/local/aclu-lawsuit-challenges-voter-residency-law-in-new-hampshire/5236/\">has brought a federal suit challenging this law.</a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d49b1c4a2be1f6c20fb3265062ce82821f486a9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d49b1c4a2be1f6c20fb3265062ce82821f486a9/0_0_6016_4016/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Student volunteers at Loyola University.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Student volunteers at Loyola Marymount University.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Loyola Marymount University</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The issue also intersects with other communities vulnerable to voter suppression. Students at Prairie View A&amp;M University, a historically black college in Waller county, Texas, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/feb/13/how-our-historically-black-university-denied-access-voting-texas\">reported</a> a lack of early voting opportunities as compared with other residents of the county and noted that polling stations were pushed off campus in 2016. In 2018, students at the school<a href=\"https://defendernetwork.com/news/local-state/prairie-view-am-students-sue-waller-county-over-early-voting-sites/\"> sued the county</a>, alleging racial discrimination, but <a href=\"https://www.naacpldf.org/press-release/black-student-voters-seek-keep-voting-rights-lawsuit-alive\">the case was dismissed</a>.</p> <p>The groups vying to shut down classes on election day are hoping the effort chips away at some of these barriers.</p> <p>In 2017, students at Rutgers pressured the administration to make election day a university holiday. According to Rutgers student Christopher Markosian, several student activists sent out a university-wide poll on the matter and found that<a href=\"https://www.dailytargum.com/article/2017/02/student-pushes-administrators-to-acknowledge-election-day-as-university-holiday\"> 95% of student respondents</a> stated that they would be more likely to vote if no classes were in session on the day of the presidential election. The university has yet to give students the day off.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/30/america-voting-rights-vote-by-mail-republicans\">Vote safely by mail in November?

According to Akhurapa Ambak, a third-year law student, the movement began when students successfully pressured several faculty members to cancel class. In 2018, this led to the school not only cancelling classes on election day but putting institutional weight behind a voter registration drive on campus.</p> <p>\u201cAny issue that one cares about, whether it\u2019s the economy, human rights, climate, education, healthcare, anything, can ultimately be traced back to the issue of voting,\u201d Ambak said. \u201cFurther, it is the youth that will, in all likelihood, be living the longest with the outcomes of elections and the ramifications of the policies enacted.\u201d</p> <p>This year, some of the initiatives have been thrown off by coronavirus since many college students have been evacuated from campus. <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/16/816092179/as-coronavirus-spreads-states-scramble-to-reassure-public-that-voting-is-safe\">Some election officials</a> initially directed students to return to campus to vote, although these recommendations became fewer as the Covid-19 threat became clearer.

  "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/02/bill-beaumont-beats-agustin-pichot-in-battle-for-control-of-world-rugby\">Bill Beaumont\u2019s re-election as World Rugby\u2019s chairman</a> was not an end but a new beginning. The former England captain faced several hurdles as a player, but nothing compared to what he faces in his final administrative stint. His narrow victory over Agust\u00edn Pichot shows there is a danger of the international game splitting unless the next few years spawn meaningful change and an end to self-interest.</p> <p>Beaumont was backed by the Six Nations while Pichot harvested the votes of the four Rugby Championship countries: had the former Argentina scrum-half persuaded one of the European unions to back him, he would have won. His failure gave the incumbent a majority of five, but Pichot did not secure enough votes from the countries and associations representing the nations below what is called tier one to bring what had been a stealthy campaign to a successful conclusion.</p> <p>There was little to choose between Beaumont and Pichot in terms of policies, but the Rugby Championship countries have become frustrated at the ability of their European rivals to thwart projects, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/19/world-rugby-nations-championship-rugby-union\">such as the </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/19/world-rugby-nations-championship-rugby-union\">Nations </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/jun/19/world-rugby-nations-championship-rugby-union\">Championship</a> which Beaumont floated last year only to see it torpedoed by Ireland and Scotland, although Pichot\u2019s Argentina ended up not voting for it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/05/rfu-government-bailout-england-summer-2021-coronavirus\">RFU will need government bailout if England do not play until summer 2021</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A central plank of Beaumont\u2019s campaign was an independent governance review, but even when he delivers it, there is no guarantee of its recommendations being approved. Some campaigning for Pichot argued only he could drag World Rugby into the professional era, failing to point out the governing body is like the United Nations where the major powers are armed with the weight of veto. Beaumont\u2019s diplomatic skills will be needed and he was the candidate best qualified to deliver change.</p> <p>The sports lawyer Darren Bailey <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/30/rugby-needs-a-command-economy-ex-world-rugby-directors-remedy\">argued in last week\u2019s Breakdown</a> that the current crisis gave rugby the opportunity to address three faultlines that had bedevilled it since 1995: north versus south, club versus country and developed versus developing. For all the talk of the need for a global calendar and greater harmonisation between the hemispheres, nothing radical will happen until the primacy of international rugby is established in all countries, which means the systems in France and England mirroring the other eight championship nations.</p> <p>Few clubs in France and England are sustainable, as the last two months have shown, but they have used borrowing and the largesse of backers to tempt players from the southern hemisphere at salaries inflated to more than compensate for either putting a Test career on hold or ending it. The Sanzaar unions responded by expanding Super Rugby to entice more out of broadcasters and help them to compete financially, but they were never able to catch up and diluted what had been the premier tournament below Test level.</p> <p>Australia \u2013 a country that, unlike New Zealand and South Africa, does not have a strong base \u2013 overextended itself and had no slack when the virus led to sport shutting down. Its union is looking for a new chief executive and this week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/06/rugby-australia-director-peter-wiggs-resigns\">appointed Rob Clarke</a>, who filled the role for the Brumbies and the Rebels, on an interim basis. \u201cThe game is facing some unprecedented challenges,\u201d he said before going off to find some answers.</p> <p>Australia, like the other southern hemisphere unions, cannot afford for the game to muddle on as before, driven not by a common goal or an executive with the authority to govern in the interest of the game rather than self-interest, but application of sticking plasters that are lacking in adhesive.</p> <p>\u201cThere is still a level of governance reform that is overdue,\u201d said New Zealand Rugby\u2019s chief executive, Brent Impey. \u201cIt would be good to see the courage taken to make the decisions needed to ensure the continued sustainability and success of rugby globally, not just for a limited number of unions and regions.\u201d</p> <p>The south will not, because they cannot afford to, endure another four years of muddle and fudge. The slickness of Pichot\u2019s campaign suggested it was not one that was hastily put together, and if Beaumont\u2019s governance review, which will be set up under the former sports minister Sir Hugh Robertson by the end of the month, comes to nothing the four Rugby Championship countries will have a choice to make: either carry on and let the Six Nations hold sway, or declare that if nothing changes they will no longer be bound by World Rugby\u2019s tour schedule.</p> <p>The ultimate threat would be to break away, but where would they go? They would be out of the World Cup and have no more Lions tours. If Europe continues to oppose the plan for a Nations Championship, something that would offer emerging nations a route to tournament rugby, and with it any form of revenue sharing, a meaningful tactic would be to pull out of the July and November Test windows and negotiate matches on an individual basis.</p> <p>They may be helped, in the short term at least, by the lack of liquidity of clubs in France and England. The upward curve of salaries will be checked and there will be a review of salary cap levels and, in England, the dispensation that allows two marquee players to be registered outside the cap with no limits on their wages.</p> <p>World Rugby has the opportunity to lead from the front, but Beaumont can do no more than advise and help formulate policies. A transformative plan such as the Nations Championship should not have its fate dependent on the unanimous assent of the Six Nations or Rugby Championship. It is the old amateur way of operating, for the benefit of the few.</p> <p>Those days are gone, as Beaumont appreciates every bit as much as Pichot. If the last couple of months have shown anything, it is that the game needs to expand globally. Its footprint is too small. That did not matter once, but it does now.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/4138\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Breakdown\" data-form-description=\"Get our weekly rugby union email\" scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>The Breakdown: sign up and get our weekly rugby union email.</figcaption> </figure>  <ul> <li><p><em><strong>This is an extract from our weekly rugby union email, the Breakdown.

  "<p>Victory in Europe was made possible by a remarkable military collaboration between the main anti-Axis powers \u2013 the US, Russia and Britain.

In it, Eisenhower detailed his plans for the final defeat of Nazi Germany \u2013 but omitted to first consult or inform his British allies.</p> <p>Stalin was determined the Red Army would be the first to get to Berlin and topple Adolf Hitler, attaching great symbolic importance to capturing the capital of the Third Reich and its implications for the future European order.

But Churchill could only fume impotently.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0515355b0a4bfa5a689b1ce75191cf70df96a316\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0515355b0a4bfa5a689b1ce75191cf70df96a316/0_292_3476_2087/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Street fighting in Berlin during the battle to gain control of the German capital in April 1945\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Street fighting in Berlin during the battle to gain control of the German capital in April 1945.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hulton Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cAlthough I have tried in every way to put myself in sympathy with these communist leaders, I cannot feel the slightest trust or confidence in them. Force and facts are their only realities,\u201d Churchill said. By 8 May, Berlin had fallen to the Red Army, Hitler was dead, and Stalin had his victory.</p> <p>Tensions between the emerging US superpower and a weakened, indebted Britain clinging to its empire, continued through the postwar period. As the author Robert Worth has argued, the idea that Britain was happily content to pass the baton of global leadership to Washington after 1945 is a myth. \u201cThe British did all they could to maintain their overseas empire and deeply resented American efforts to displace them,\u201d Worth wrote.</p> <p>The Americans opposed British colonialism. But, the British said, the US merely replaced it with a de facto colonialism of their own. This rivalry produced <a href=\"https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2019/10/24/end-show-britain-united-states-middle-east/\">myriad overt and covert tussles for power and influence</a>, particularly in the Middle East.</p> <p>The US, for example, initially backed Iran\u2019s nationalist prime minister, Mohammad Mosaddegh, who, during a 1951 US speaking tour, likened himself to a patriot from the American war of independence fighting British imperialism. Washington, fearful Iran might turn communist, changed tack two years later and backed a British coup plot against Mosaddegh that led ultimately to the 1979 Islamic revolution.</p> <p>In another cloak-and-dagger episode, an American spy masquerading as a foreign correspondent attempted to recruit Egypt\u2019s King Farouk, a British client. The mission was known within the CIA as Operation Fat Fucker. Farouk was later overthrown in a 1952 coup led by Gamal Abdel Nasser, whom US agents had befriended, which, in turn, led to Britain\u2019s 1956 Suez humiliation.</p> <p>Churchill hated Britain\u2019s new-found subservience, but urged his successors to stick to his maxim: \u201cNever be separated from the Americans\u201d. To a large degree, they have. With the exception of Harold Wilson, who broke with Washington over the Vietnam war, later British prime ministers have followed America\u2019s lead on most international issues.</p> <p>And concerning relations with Russia, British and US policy became largely indistinguishable during the cold war. Stalin\u2019s fear in 1945 that western powers would cut a \u201csecret deal\u201d and unite to oppose the Soviet Union came true, exemplified in later years by a Nato alliance that included West Germany.</p> <p>Today\u2019s world bears some uncanny similarities to the world of 1945. Post-Soviet Russia under Vladimir Putin is again on the offensive, employing asymmetrical means such as info-wars and cyberhacks instead of armoured divisions to project its influence across Europe.</p> <p>Boris Johnson\u2019s post-Brexit Britain, having rejected the concept of a common European home, stands alone in ways not seen since 1940. Brexiters\u2019 calls for a stronger US security, economic and trade relationship, to offset the EU rupture, are the modern-day equivalent of Churchill\u2019s desperate \u201cdarkest hour\u201d appeals for Roosevelt\u2019s help.</p> <p>As for the US, Donald Trump\u2019s collusion with Putin\u2019s Russia, and disdain for America\u2019s European allies, is reminiscent of Roosevelt\u2019s and Eisenhower\u2019s naivety in 1945. Not for nothing is Stalin one of Putin\u2019s great heroes.</p>",

\u201c<strong>painfully slow</strong>\u201d.</p> \n  <p>And he said: \u201cWe have <strong>turned the corner</strong>, but then you take New York out of the national numbers and the numbers for the rest of the nation are going up.\u201d</p> \n  <p>Cuomo added, during the question and answer session with the media: \u201cYou have states opening up where the numbers are still on the incline, I
