America First Action, a pro-Trump Super Political Action Committee, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AmericaFirstPAC/status/1268956740026077187?s=20]\">claimed in a tweet</a> that his remark was taken \u201cout of context\u201d.

But Democrats and other critics were unconvinced, noting that Trump had specifically tied Floyd\u2019s imagined happiness to Friday, the day of the jobs report.</p> \n<p>Brandon Gassaway, a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee, said: \u201cTrump\u2019s claim is revolting, enraging, disrespectful \u2013 a slap in the face and a descent to the lowest possible level of discourse. Trump has no concern or regard for the feelings of anyone and will take every opportunity, even trampling on the memory of George Floyd, to commemorate a jobs report that shows fewer than half of black adults currently have a job and that fully 21 million Americans are unemployed.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"0617b81f-5431-457d-b963-3e057fc1b578\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/gfIWyPgE_E0?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>The surprise increase in jobs came after economists had predicted a rise in unemployment to 20% as America reels from the coronavirus pandemic and nationwide lockdowns.

Analysts Capital Economics wrote that the report generated mixed feelings of \u201coptimism, skepticism and anguish\u201d.</p> \n<p>They expect the economy to recoup about 60% of lost jobs by year-end with the unemployment rate dropping to 8-10%.</p> \n<p>The president has been fiercely condemned for mishandling the pandemic and showing little empathy for minorities who suffered the worst of its health and economic effects, then for responding to nationwide protests by ordering law enforcement to \u201cdominate\u201d the streets and even threatening to deploy the military.</p> \n<p>But Trump will hope the May report boosts his chance in November\u2019s election against former vice-president Biden. In April, <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/26/2020-election-democrats-281470\">Jason Furman</a>, a former economist in the Barack Obama administration, predicted: \u201cWe are about to see the best economic data we\u2019ve seen in the history of this country\u201d \u2013 a suggestion that reportedly alarmed Democratic strategists.</p> \n<p>Speaking in the White House Rose Garden on Friday, Trump struck a triumphal note, likening the economy to a healthy patient making a quick recovery. \u201cThis is outstanding, what\u2019s happened today,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, they thought the number would be a loss of 9m jobs and it was a gain of almost 3m jobs.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe numbers are great, and this leads us on to a long period of growth. We\u2019ll go back to having the greatest economy anywhere in the world. Nothing close. And I think we\u2019re going to have a very good upcoming few months.\u201d</p> \n<p>Some commentators have expressed hope that, having been put into an induced coma, the economy could make a \u201cV-shaped\u201d recovery. Trump again brushed aside warnings from public health experts and urged state governors to push ahead with economic reopenings.</p> \n<p>\u201cNow we\u2019re opening, and we\u2019re opening with a bang,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been talking about the V. This is better than a V. This is a rocket ship.\u201d</p> \n<p>Yamiche Alcindor, the White House correspondent of PBS News, asked Trump if he has a plan to address systemic racism. He replied: \u201cIt\u2019s the greatest thing that can happen for race relations, for the African-American community, for the Asian American, for the Hispanic-American community, for women, for everything.</p> \n<p>\u201cBecause our country is so strong, and that\u2019s what my plan is. We\u2019re going to have the strongest economy in the world. We almost are there now \u2026 And now we\u2019re going to have an economy that\u2019s even stronger.\u201d</p> \n<p>Although the unemployment rate for white people decreased from 14.2% to 12.4%, the rate for African Americans went up from 16.7% to 16.8%. When Alcindor challenged Trump on this point, he dismissed her with a wave and said: \u201cYou are something.\u201d</p> \n<p>Democrats dismissed Trump\u2019s bombast and said he was out of touch with the pain and anguish felt by millions, particularly African Americans.</p> \n<p>Chuck Schumer, the Democratic minority leader in the Senate, said: \u201cWith nearly 20m people out of work and unemployment among African Americans increasing, now is not the time to be complacent or take a victory lap. Thirteen per cent unemployment number is not \u2018joyous\u2019 or \u2018stupendous\u2019 as President Trump has wrongly stated.\u201d</p> \n<p>Jon Favreau, a former speechwriter for Obama, tweeted: \u201cDepression-era unemployment, 100,000+ dead, millions sick, massive protests, police riots, and Trump is giving a celebratory press conference. Not sure I\u2019ve ever heard a president sound so divorced from the reality that most Americans are facing. Hilariously out of touch.\u201d</p>",

Friday, the first minister was questioned about his government\u2019s position on non-medical coverings after a trade union representing doctors in Wales said bringing in rules would help control the

not come in until 15 June, and that gives us a short number of days in order to consider the position here in Wales recognising that changed context.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n  <p>Drakeford said a \u201cdefinitive statement\u201d on the issue would be made in the first part of next week, and that detailed questions about England\u2019s new rules would be explored with ministers and officials in Westminster.</p> \n  <p>But he said the UK government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \u201cmaking the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards\u201d.</p> \n  <p>Earlier on Friday the <strong>British Medical Association</strong> (BMA) Wales called on the Welsh government to change its stance on non-medical face coverings, and ensure a supply are available to the public.</p> \n  <p>The trade union\u2019s council chair for Wales, Dr David Bailey, said: </p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>There still remains a considerable risk of infection, and emerging evidence has shown that if mouths and noses are covered when people are in areas where they cannot socially distance, it may help in controlling the spread of infection of Covid-19 and therefore save lives.</p> \n   <p>BMA Cymru Wales is calling on the Welsh government to change their position immediately,

  "<p>On April 4 1968, Martin Luther King Jr phoned a local pastor with the title of his Sunday sermon: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.mintpressnews.com/mlks-children-reveal-undelivered-king-speech-america-may-go-hell/240264/\" title=\"\">Why America May Go to Hell</a>.\u201d The civil rights leader was shot dead before he could address the parishioners of Ebenezer Baptist church in Atlanta. Over the next few weeks the United States found itself on the road to perdition. King\u2019s murder saw the country experience its greatest wave of social unrest since the civil war, with riots in 130 cities. In November of that year, Richard Nixon won a law and order election by stoking the unspoken bigotry that the street violence had done so much to revive. Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/02/opinion/floyd-trump-nixon-coronavirus.html\" title=\"\">thinks he can do the same</a> with the nationwide protests over police brutality toward African Americans in the wake of the death of George Floyd. But history does not repeat itself, people do.</p> <p>There are signs that Americans have grown to be significantly better than their previous selves. The protests have drawn wide support from society. Mainly peaceful demonstrations have been a showcase for America\u2019s diversity. Mr Trump\u2019s polling numbers have <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/us/politics/trump-campaign-virus-protests-polls.html\" title=\"\">plunged</a>. Surveys show that voters approve of the protests inspired by Floyd\u2019s death, and strongly disapprove of the president\u2019s response. There has been a sea change in <a href=\"https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-lots-of-white-democrats-ended-up-protesting-the-death-of-george-floyd/\" title=\"\">attitudes</a>, with Americans seeming to acknowledge that racism is a real problem for their society. The police officer who was seen suffocating Floyd with his knee has been charged with second-degree felony murder. Confederate statues and other relics to racism have come down in several states.</p> <p>There is also a long way to the 2020 presidential election. The demonstrations and violence may be a faraway memory by then. The political gaze may be fixed on a second coronavirus outbreak or the failing economy. The chaotic handling of the pandemic has left 100,000 dead and is evidence that Mr Trump is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/15/donald-trump-coronavirus-response-world-leaders\" title=\"\">not up to the job</a>. The past is also another country. The unrest today is against a backdrop of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/18/global-report-coronavirus-us-unemployment-could-hit-25-warns-fed-chairman-as-japan-enters-recession\" title=\"\">depression</a>, deprivation and deep inequality, not the full employment and roaring US economy of the late 1960s. The portents do not look good for a president running for re-election.</p> <p>The story of American politics since 1968 is dominated by a Republican party that gained a <a href=\"http://omarwasow.com/APSR_protests3_1.pdf\" title=\"\">political base</a> through Nixon\u2019s explicit appeals to whites who resented or were opposed to the civil rights movement. Republican leaders went on to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1981/09/29/reagan-blames-crime-on-human-predator/2892636f-d176-48fb-b06b-39012eace1f4/\" title=\"\">weaponise racism</a> to remain in power, which they used to pursue policies that enriched the already affluent at the expense of ordinary workers.

Black people often live in the poorest areas and suffer the highest rates of unemployment. Relative to white people, black people receive longer sentences for the same crimes, are treated more disrespectfully by police in routine interactions, and are more likely to be shot by law enforcement. Blacks have long outnumbered whites in US prisons despite representing a fraction of the total population. So stacked is the deck against them that black boys \u2013 even rich black boys \u2013 can never assume <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/03/19/upshot/race-class-white-and-black-men.html\" title=\"\">they can escape the poverty trap</a>. This is not a recipe for social comity.</p> <p>King understood this.

And as long as America postpones justice, we stand in the position of having these recurrences of violence and riots over and over again. Social justice and progress are the absolute guarantors of riot prevention.\u201d America must do more than listen to the unheard, it must hear them.</p>",

He\u2019s had it since at least 2004, and we know you didn\u2019t come up with it because it\u2019s a cool nickname and your nicknames suck \u2026 if you had come up with a nickname for him it would\u2019ve been something like Lame James or Jumpin\u2019 Jim.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2020/jun/04/stephen-colbert-trump-is-a-dictator-fanboy\">Stephen Colbert: 'Trump is a dictator fanboy'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s clear, Meyers continued, that \u201cTrump and the police establishment are obviously threatened by the widespread popularity of the protests, which have been both effective and everywhere.\u201d Protesters have spoken up in all 50 states. \u201cThe map is finally all red, but not for the reason that Trump wants,\u201d said Meyers.</p> <p>\u201cThis kind of massive, sustained political mobilization represents a direct threat to the unjust system of predatory policing we currently have, which is why the people who benefit from this system are lashing out so aggressively,\u201d Meyers continued. \u201cOne after another, we\u2019ve watched countless videos of local police departments arresting or violently attacking peaceful protesters, and reporters lawfully exercising their first amendment rights.\u201d</p> <p>For example, cellphone video captured a Miami police officer shoving a woman with her hands up to the ground; the <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/crime/article243234261.html\">Miami Herald later found</a> that that officer had been reviewed by police internal affairs for excessive force 79 times in three and a half years on the job. \u201cSeventy-nine times in three and a half years \u2013 I haven\u2019t used shampoo that much in the same time period,\u201d said Meyers. \u201cAnd granted, I probably should\u2019ve, but how many times do you have to get in trouble before you get fired. No other job works like that! If a commercial airline pilot had been investigated 79 times for flying upside down and doing barrel rolls while hammered on Goldschl\u00e4ger, we wouldn\u2019t be like, \u2018All right, man, 80 strikes and you\u2019re out!\u2019\u201d</p> <h2>Stephen Colbert</h2> <p>On the Late Show, Stephen Colbert marveled at the spread of the protests across America, noting that at least 430 cities and towns \u2013 from New York to Atlanta to Laramie, Wyoming, and Helena, Montana \u2013 have seen demonstrations in support of Black Lives Matter. \u201cThese protests are uniting Americans of all backgrounds, because you may have noticed that Boise, Idaho, does not have a lot of black people.

And you might not know that if you watch cable news, because to the news, peace is boring. That\u2019s why CNN just launched their sister network: the Burning Trash Can Channel.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, tensions have been escalated by police enforcing curfews in cities across the nation, from New York to Los Angeles. \u201cThe point of a curfew is to stop lawbreakers from taking advantage of protests, but in some cities, protesters are getting swept up by cops in curfews starting as early as 6pm,\u201d Colbert explained, as police use curfew \u201cas an excuse to bring the smackdown on peaceful protesters\u201d.</p> <p>Colbert also touched on Mattis\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/06/james-mattis-denounces-trump-protests-militarization/612640/\">public denunciation of Trump</a>, which he called \u201cespecially surprising\u201d because Mattis\u2019s parting words were: \u201cI will not speak ill of a sitting president.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cEvidently, he will speak ill of a president sitting on a bed covered in cold curly fries,\u201d said Colbert.</p> <h2>Jimmy Kimmel</h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fB6xszdzBEQ\"                                                                        >  <iframe height=\"259\" width=\"460\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fB6xszdzBEQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen ></iframe>  </figure>   <p>\u201cProtests are continuing nationwide,\u201d said Jimmy Kimmel on Thursday night, and in Washington, \u201cwhere law enforcement has taken a much more forceful approach, including teargassing peaceful protesters, things are not as amicable.</p> <p>\u201cAuthorities there are busy&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/white-house-adds-new-fencing-around-perimeter-n1225296\">erecting another fence</a>&nbsp;that will go around the existing White House fence, which will make two fences.\u201c Kimmel continued. \u201cSo it looks like Trump is finally getting his wall built after all. How long before we find out Don Jr invested in a fence company?\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, Kimmel dissected Trump\u2019s tweet-response to Mattis\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/06/james-mattis-denounces-trump-protests-militarization/612640/\">one-star Yelp review</a>\u201d which called Trump a threat to the constitution. Trump\u2019s claim that he nicknamed Mattis Mad Dog is an outright lie, given that he has been called that for many years prior to his work in the administration. \u201cWhat a strange thing to lie about \u2013 it\u2019s so easily disproved!\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Finally, a Twitter user experimented with posting Trump\u2019s tweets, verbatim, to see if they would be blocked for inciting violence. They were indeed blocked by the platform, while Trump\u2019s exact same tweets went unmarked. Which made Kimmel wonder if \u201cmaybe Twitter has a way of determining who is and isn\u2019t a threat based on how tiny the person who tweeted\u2019s thumbs are\u201d.</p>",

In this all-too prevalent way of thinking, there\u2019s only one cure for racism. As Dan Patrick, the Republican lieutenant governor of Texas, told <a href=\"https://www.newsmax.com/us/dan-patrick-god-race-jesus/2020/06/04/id/970502/\">Fox News</a> on Wednesday, the country could only be \u201chealed\u201d by people accepting Jesus Christ.</p> <p>But when it comes to the systemic change demanded by lawful protesters all over the country, from its largest cities to its small towns, Trump\u2019s defenders draw the line. \u201cWe cannot heal through commissions and blue-ribbon panels and more laws,\u201d Patrick told Trump\u2019s favorite network. Graham <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/FranklinGraham/posts/3346901932032631?__tn__=-R\">wrote</a> in a Facebook post, \u201cNew laws and more government give-away programs are not the answer. It\u2019s a heart problem, and only God can change the human heart.\u201d</p> <p>This white evangelical opposition to laws and policies addressing systemic racism is nothing new. At other similarly transformative moments in recent American history, white fundamentalists and evangelicals viewed the advance of civil rights in America as the nefarious work of leftist outsiders, and opposed laws and policy designed to promote equal rights.</p> <p>In 1964, the late Jerry Falwell Sr, the founder of the Moral Majority and the father of Jerry Falwell Jr, one of Trump\u2019s most steadfast evangelical defenders, called the 1964 Civil Rights Act \u201ca terrible violation of human and private property rights\u201d and said it \u201cshould be considered civil wrongs rather than civil rights\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The president and his allies, both in and outside of government, defame protesters as disingenuous, violent, un-American, and even criminal</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Falwell delivered one of his most notorious sermons, Ministers and Marches, in 1965 after Bloody Sunday, when state troopers, sheriff deputies and a white civilian posse beat and teargassed civil rights activists marching from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama. \u201cI do question the sincerity and non-violent intentions of\u201d the Rev Martin Luther King Jr and other civil rights leaders, Falwell said, \u201cwho are known to have leftwing associations\u201d.</p> <p>Although 15 years later Falwell purported to repudiate the sermon, its ugly sentiments reverberate in Trump\u2019s America today. The president and his allies, both in and outside of government, defame protesters as disingenuous, violent, un-American, and even criminal. Meanwhile, they hail the law enforcement officers who are violating protesters\u2019 constitutional rights and inflicting horrifying violence as America\u2019s heroes.</p> <p>In the early days of the modern religious right, school desegregation animated white fundamentalists and evangelicals to mobilize in opposition to government policy they claimed violated their religious freedom. In the 1970s, the Internal Revenue Service tried to require private Christian schools, even those without explicitly segregationist policies, to adopt measures to diversify their student body, by making their tax-exemption contingent on such improvements. For these early religious right activists, this was a sign that the government, acting as a promoter of equal rights, was the enemy of the religious freedom of Christians.</p> <p>Religious right activist and Left Behind author Tim LaHaye accused the government of \u201charassing\u201d Christian schools. \u201cDoesn\u2019t it seem strange that the US government is lenient on communists, criminals, drug pushers, illegal aliens, rapists, lesbians, homosexuals and almost anyone else who violates the law, but is increasing its attacks on Christians?\u201d LaHaye wrote in 1979.</p> <p>Today, Trump\u2019s base echoes similar claims of persecution \u2013 claiming that LGBTQ+ rights, for example, infringe on Christians\u2019 religious freedom, or that state governors\u2019 restrictions on large gatherings during the Covid-19 pandemic infringe on the first amendment rights of churches. Throughout his candidacy and presidency white evangelicals have stood behind Trump because, many of them say, he is \u201cthe most pro-religious freedom\u201d president in history.</p> <p>Their ongoing support for Trump \u2013 as he cracks down on protesters and hijacks the front of a church to pose with a bible \u2013 is, unfortunately, another chapter in this long history, one in which Trump has emerged as their dedicated strongman, unafraid to defend their \u201cfreedom\u201d, no matter the cost to other Americans.</p> <ul> <li><p>Sarah Posner is a reporting fellow at Type Investigations.

Witness video shows Chauvin kneeling on Floyd\u2019s neck during an arrest, for almost nine minutes. Floyd pleads he cannot breathe, then stops moving.<br></p> \n  <p>Minnesota attorney general Keith Ellison <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/03/george-floyd-killing-derek-chauvin-charge-elevated-three-other-officers-charged\">announced the charges</a> against Thao, Lane and Kueng on Wednesday, also increasing the charge against Chauvin.</p> \n  <p>Here\u2019s the Associated Press:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Defense attorneys argued for lower bail. They told the court Chauvin was the training officer for Lane and Kueng, who had been on the job just four and three days respectively. Defendants don\u2019t normally enter pleas during their first appearances in Minnesota courts, which tend to be brief proceedings. Judge Paul Scoggin set their next court dates for 29 June.</p> \n   <p>If convicted, Chauvin faces a maximum of 40 years in prison on the murder count and 10 years for manslaughter. Under Minnesota law, aiding and abetting second-degree murder is tantamount a second-degree murder charge, so <strong>Thao, Lane and Kueng face the same potential penalties</strong> if convicted. A date for Chauvin\u2019s first court appearance has not been set.</p> \n   <p>The complaint against Lane, 37, notes that he asked about rolling Floyd on his side and wondered about delirium, but went on to say that Lane \u201ctook no actions to assist Mr Floyd, to change his position, or to reduce the force the officers were using against Mr Floyd.\u201d</p> \n   <p>The complaint against Kueng, 26, says he was positioned between Chauvin and Lane and could hear their comments. The complaint against Thao, 34, who was seen in the cellphone video standing near a crowd of bystanders, says the officer initially got a hobble restraint from the squad car, \u201cbut the officers decided not to use it and maintained their positions.\u201d</p> \n   <p>Governor Tim Walz and the Minnesota Department of Human Rights ordered a civil rights investigation of the police department to determine how to address its history of racial discrimination and find solutions for systemic change.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-06-04T20:10:07.371Z\">at 9.10pm BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed934288f0854eb54d98f62\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-06-04T19:21:34.521Z\">8.21pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>As Nick Confessore of the New York Times put it on Twitter today, \u201cTrump began his term promising to build a wall to protect America from the world.

Thousands of protesters march nightly through the city\u2019s streets demanding justice for Floyd and an end to police brutality, especially against African Americans.</p> <p>The protesters are generally backed by Detroit residents. They and their supporters see the police as aggressors; officers have fired teargas, flash grenades and rubber bullets, sometimes at protesters who are peaceful but breaking curfew. Activists say the marches are the only appropriate response to a grave injustice.&nbsp;</p> <p>But about 17 miles north-east of downtown Detroit, in the largely white, middle-class suburb of St Clair Shores, some see a totally different reality playing out. Residents here who spoke to the Guardian said the police were acting with restraint and protesters were aggressors who are provoking violence.&nbsp;</p> <p>While Detroit\u2019s population is more than 80% black, St Clair Shores, which sits just a few miles from the city\u2019s northern border, is 93% white \u2013 a common racial disparity in a highly segregated region. Most of Detroit\u2019s white residents left the city for suburbs like St Clair Shores in the decade following the city\u2019s 1967 protests over racial inequality. The violent \u201crebellion\u201d raged for days as hundreds of buildings were burned and 16 died.&nbsp;</p> <p>These are the people whom Donald Trump is seeking to appeal to with his bid to be a \u201claw and order\u201d president as he seeks re-election. He hopes to mobilize a largely white voter base that has historically shunned integration and sought to preserve its privileges in the face of political and economic advancement by minorities.</p> <p>Many in St Clair Shores share the president\u2019s world view that the police and national guard are heroically battling violent agitators, not brutally suppressing largely peaceful protesters.&nbsp;</p> <p>Several men who were part of a construction crew called the protests \u201cstupid\u201d and a \u201cwaste of time and energy\u201d. Some even suggested Floyd was at fault for his death because he allegedly committed a crime, despite general worldwide outrage at the brutal manner of his killing and the criminal charges it has now brought against the officers involved.&nbsp;</p> <p>Others, like Gloria Kinne, a St Clair Shores business owner, acknowledged that racial discrimination exists \u201cin isolated spots\u201d and said she supported the right to peaceful protest, but she added that she was troubled by images of protesters clashing with police and vandalizing property.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m really sorry to see the violence come into it,\u201d Kinne said. \u201cThe people who are harmed are the small businesses and people who have nothing to do with it and no control over it. It\u2019s been bad enough with Covid-19, but now they have their stores vandalized on top of that.\u201d</p> <p>Jim Angel, a St Clair Shores retiree, suggested it was African Americans who were always behind police protests, though he ignored the long and unique history of black people in America, a land where they were once enslaved.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThis hasn\u2019t had anything to do with the Irish, Polish and Germans \u2013&nbsp;why is it only one ethnic group that needs change?\u201d he asked.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7cadae1948acd36ea17c50e7df4d0c5bd7019188\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7cadae1948acd36ea17c50e7df4d0c5bd7019188/0_30_5063_3039/1000.jpg\" alt=\"St Clair Shores, Michigan, amid the coronavirus lockdown.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">St Clair Shores, Michigan, amid the coronavirus lockdown.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Sancya/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Politically, St Clair Shores is considered a swing district in the vital 2020 battleground state of Michigan, though it has leaned conservative in recent elections. Trump beat Hillary Clinton by between 10 and 20 points in each of the city\u2019s precincts in 2016.&nbsp;</p> <p>The reviews of Trump\u2019s handling of the protests have been mixed. Kinne said with a laugh, \u201cYou don\u2019t want to hear my answer to that,\u201d when asked about the president\u2019s response. But local resident Ted Miller said he \u201capplauds\u201d the president\u2019s harsh measures and inflammatory rhetoric. He also \u201cfully supports\u201d any decision to call in the military.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThese are the kind of things that he\u2019s best at. He\u2019s the law and order president,\u201d Miller said.&nbsp;</p> <p>Angel told the Guardian he didn\u2019t think the military was needed yet, and also praised the police for remaining \u201cvery, very calm\u201d in the face of provocation.</p> <p>Kinne echoed that, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s important that they measure their response based on the temper of the protest.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cIf the protest is peaceful then the police need to be \u2013 and they have been \u2013 very calm,\u201d she said. \u201cOn the other hand, if the protest becomes violent, then they have the right to protect themselves, too.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Kinne added that she disagreed with claims that racism and police brutality are systemic within law enforcement, despite the fact minority groups, and especially African Americans, suffer disproportionately at the hands of the justice system and the police.</p> <p>Kinne did not believe it was fair to blame \u201call police in every state in every city for what certain individuals do\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cThe vast majority of police officers and first responders are out there doing good,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are a few bad actors among shopkeepers, among steelworkers and among any group of people you\u2019re going to find an element that can be violent and be racist, and it\u2019s a terrible thing, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to say, \u2018All police are violent.\u2019\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>Though the protests are an emotional controversy, Miller said the country was \u201cfull of controversies\u201d and he didn\u2019t think this would influence the November election.&nbsp;</p> <p>\u201cPeople already have their minds made up how they\u2019re going to vote,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is just one more thing for everyone to disagree about and fight about.\u201d&nbsp;</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 8 June 2020 because an earlier version referred to Detroit\u2019s 1967 protests as having happened in 1968.
