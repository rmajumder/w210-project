The plan is likely to be as controversial since Russia has been banned from western-led summits following Putin\u2019s annexation of Crimea in 2014, and is not seen as a natural ally in the fight to defend human rights in Hong Kong.</p> \n  <p>Merkel and the French President Emmanuel Macron will also be reluctant to provide Trump with a prestigious platform, weeks ahead of the US Presidential election, to set out his China strategy.

The US is the worst-affected country in terms of cases and deaths, with 1,769,776 infections and 103,685 fatalities.</li> \n   <li><strong>Donald Trump postpones G7 summit and signals wider attendance list. </strong>In a dramatic pivot, US president Donald Trump has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/31/donald-trump-postpones-g7-summit-and-signals-wider-attendance-list-in-future\">postponed the Group of Seven</a> summit that he wanted to hold in June. He will also expand the list of countries invited to attend the rescheduled event to include Australia, Russia, South Korea and India. Speaking to reporters on Air Force One during his return to Washington from Cape Canaveral in Florida, Trump said the G7 in its current format was a \u201cvery outdated group of countries. I\u2019m postponing it because I don\u2019t feel that as a G7 it properly represents what\u2019s going on in the world.\u201d</li> \n   <li><strong>Key UK election battlegrounds face double hit. </strong>Key English election battlegrounds in the north-west and Midlands will be severely exposed to a double economic hit from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/31/key-election-battlegrounds-face-double-hit-from-brexit-and-coronavirus\">Brexit and coronavirus</a> should the UK fail to secure an EU trade deal by the end of the year, new analysis has warned. Boris Johnson has continued to rule out any extension to Britain\u2019s EU transition deal, which expires from January. It comes despite a deadlock in talks about a future trade deal, before the final round of talks this week.</li> \n   <li><strong>Pressure builds on South African president. </strong>South African president Cyril Ramaphosa faces a fresh leadership test over his handling of the coronavirus outbreak as Africa\u2019s most industrialised nation prepares to reopen its economy on Monday. South Africa had already slipped into recession in the final quarter of 2019 before the virus arrived in March, and the rand has depreciated by 22.9% since January. Under eased restrictions, all but high-risk sectors of the economy will be allowed to reopen on Monday. The country reported 1,727 new cases, taking the cumulative total to 30,967.</li> \n   <li><strong>Brazil cases near 500,000. </strong>Brazil registered a record 33,274 new cases of the novel coronavirus on Saturday, its health ministry said, raising the total to 498,440 in a country with one of the world\u2019s worst outbreaks. The death toll in Brazil from Covid-19, the respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus, increased to 28,834, with 956 new deaths in the last 24 hours, the ministry said.</li> \n   <li><strong>Los Angeles shuts down Covid-19 testing amid protests. </strong>Coronavirus testing centres in Los Angeles, California have been closed due to safety concerns amid protests over the death of George Floyd, according to LA Mayor Eric Garcetti, who said the centres were being closed \u201cbecause of the safety worries across the city\u201d.</li> \n   <li><strong>South Korea reports 27 new cases. </strong>South Korea has reported 27 new cases of the coronavirus, including 21 from the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area, where officials have been scrambling to stem transmissions linked to club-goers and warehouse workers. The figures announced by South Korea\u2019s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Sunday brought national totals to 11,468 cases and 270 deaths. Twelve of the new cases were linked to international arrivals.</li> \n   <li><strong>Pope calls for world leaders to provide relief. </strong>Pope Francis implored world leaders to provide social and economic relief for the many workers who have lost jobs, and called for the enormous sums of money used to grow and perfect armaments be instead used to fund research to prevent similar catastrophes in the future.</li> \n   <li><strong>Cummings affair a danger to life, say experts. </strong>Britain\u2019s top public health leaders warned Boris Johnson that trust in the government has been shattered by the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/dominic-cummings\">Dominic Cummings</a> affair and now poses real danger to life when lockdown measures are lifted this week. Cummings, Johnson\u2019s top aide, has been embroiled in a scandal after he was seen in Durham, 264 miles from his London home, despite having had coronavirus symptoms.

You get a chance to think about your life.

There are different ways of organising education and work and healthcare and social and family life \u2026 and in fact, some of the ways we have chosen to organise these things in lockdown, we actually quite like.\u201d</p> <p>Kishore says now that we have \u201cdemonstrated\u201d there are alternative ways of doing things, the key is to continue to make choices about how we want our post-lockdown lives to look, including the way we want to work.</p> <p><strong>\u201c</strong>Recognising that \u2013 amongst all the change and uncertainty \u2013 we have choices and agency in how we remake our world of work and social life can help us to navigate that uncertainty with grace and optimism.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>\u2018</strong>Humans can be incredibly adaptable\u2019</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5863cd8d8978aec1083555438eb154b29d136d01\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5863cd8d8978aec1083555438eb154b29d136d01/0_0_4835_3264/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Round-the-world solo yachtswoman Jessica Watson rounding the southern tip of Tasmania in 2010\" width=\"1000\" height=\"675\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Round-the-world solo yachtswoman Jessica Watson rounding the southern tip of Tasmania in 2010.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sam Rosewarne/Newspix/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jessica Watson, who became the youngest person to sail around the world at the age of 16, says people will also need to give themselves time to readjust to yet another significant upheaval in their lives.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the big lessons for me when I set off on my voyage was accepting that that first little period was going to be really tough ...

National guard troops were called in and violent confrontation ensued.</p> <h2>Salt Lake City</h2> <p>The capital of conservative Utah is not known as hotbed of unrest but a protest denouncing racism and deadly force by law enforcement turned violent on Saturday as protesters set cars on fire and threw rocks at businesses. Police responded with rubber bullets and arrests, the Salt Lake Tribune reported, adding that earlier, hundreds peacefully marched from the police department to the capitol.</p> <h2>Cleveland</h2> <p>Curfew is mandated from Sunday afternoon until 8am Monday morning after what started as a demonstration where people wore masks against the coronavirus and distributed hand-sanitizer, food and water escalated and businesses were smashed up. Ohio governor Mike DeWine leaned on state and federal help and <a href=\"https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/05/downtown-cleveland-geigers-cleaned-out-during-saturday-riots-watch-live-video-as-clean-up-begins.html\">pledged</a> to \u201cbring to justice those whose lawlessness escalated an otherwise peaceful protest to a riot\u201d. Other Ohio cities Cincinnati and Columbus also experienced unrest.</p> <h2>Raleigh</h2> <p>Up to 1,000 protesters chanted \u201cWe want change\u201d and gathered, banging drums, in front of the courthouse in this North Carolina city. Demonstrators later stood close to police in riot gear and <a href=\"https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/article243130111.html\">shouted</a>: \u201cWho do you protect? Who do you serve?\u201d When events turned tense then violent, as darkness fell, police fired smoke bombs and teargassed and pepper-sprayed the public and press.</p> <h2>Louisville</h2> <p>A third night of anger in Kentucky also marked the death in March of resident <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/14/breonna-taylor-louisville-police-shooting-kentucky\">Breonna Taylor</a>, when police raided her home while she slept in bed.

Atlanta officials have blamed some out-of-area provocateurs for escalating demonstrations into violence in the city, a concern echoed by many other leaders, including in Minneapolis.

The presidential residence was guarded by armored vehicles and personnel as sweating, packed protesters eventually <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/trump-accuses-dc-mayor-of-refusing-to-help-secret-service-at-white-house-demonstration-over-killing-of-george-floyd/2020/05/30/9bb59212-a276-11ea-9590-1858a893bd59_story.html\">boiled over</a> and threw fireworks and bottles, police swinging batons and firing pepper spay balls in response.

A successful splashdown sometime this summer will pave the way for regular operational missions as early as August.&nbsp;</p> <p>In a long-held tradition, the astronauts got to choose a name for their spaceship, and announced several hours after their spectacular lift-off from the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral they were honoring a shuttle orbiter they both flew aboard.</p> <p>\u201cWithout further ado, we would like to welcome you aboard capsule Endeavour,\u201d Hurley said.</p> <p>\u201cWe chose Endeavour for a few reasons, because of this incredible endeavour Nasa, SpaceX and the United States have been on since the end of the shuttle program back in 2011.</p> <p>\u201cThe other reason is a little more personal to Bob and I. We both had our first flights on shuttle Endeavour, and it just meant so much for us to carry on that name.\u201d</p> <p>Nasa\u2019s flight managers in Houston had welcoming words for the crew after assuming control of Behnken and Hurley\u2019s mission following Endeavour\u2019s docking.</p> <p>\u201cFor the first time since the retirement of the space shuttle, you have completed a historic ride to the ISS and have opened up a new chapter in human space exploration,\u201d&nbsp;Joshua Kutryk, a space station mission controller declared.</p> <p>\u201cTo our SpaceX colleagues, bravo on a magnificent moment in spaceflight history and on the start of a new journey that has changed the face of space travel in this new era of space transportation.\u201d</p> <p>Saturday\u2019s groundbreaking launch, which took place at 3.22pm ET after being delayed by poor weather from Wednesday, lit the skies over Cape Canaveral as the Falcon 9 rocket blazed a trail across the Atlantic ocean on a 12-minute journey to orbit. The capsule could be seen in the skies above the UK, chasing down the ISS.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been way too long,\u201d Jim Bridenstine, the Nasa administrator, said of the launch. \u201cIt was just an amazing day. I\u2019m breathing a sigh of relief but I won\u2019t be celebrating until Bob and Doug are home safely.\u201d</p> <p>Musk, the founder of PayPal and the electric car manufacturer Tesla, was emotional at a press conference following the launch, which was attended by Donald Trump and Mike Pence, the US vice-president.</p> <p>\u201cIt is the culmination of an incredible amount of work by the SpaceX team, by Nasa, and by a number of other partners,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can look at this as the results of a hundred thousand people roughly when you add up all the suppliers and everyone working incredibly hard to make this day happen.\u201d</p>",

In your position as ambassador we seek reassurances that British journalists will be able to work in the US without fear of arrest and that you will do everything in your power to ensure that this potential international precedent is not set.<br><br>To this end we call on an immediate condemnation of the arrest by the ambassador, and all American officials based in the UK.<br><br>We also call on an immediate inquiry not only into the arrest of Omar Jimenez but into the treatment of all black journalists and journalists of colour by American authorities.<br><br>We call on the immediate suspension of the police officers involved in the arrest of Jimenez and his team until this inquiry is complete.<br><br>We stand in solidarity with Omar Jimenez and all journalists of colour who are reporting on racism in America.<br><br>Yours sincerely,<br><br>Marcus Ryder (Acting Chair of the Sir Lenny Henry Centre for Media Diversity)</em></p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5ed27be68f087122eca527b2\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-05-30T15:37:41.592Z\">4.37pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>The Kentucky governor, Andy Beshear</strong>, has followed Minnesota\u2019s lead by <strong>calling in the National Guard</strong>.

Trump, remember, tweeted on Friday \u201cWhen the looting starts, the shooting starts\u201d, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/29/twitter-hides-donald-trump-tweet-glorifying-violence\">was censored by Twitter</a>, then claimed he hadn\u2019t known the inflammatory and racist nature of the phrase, let alone had intended to call for violence against his own citizens.</p> \n  <p>On Friday night, hundreds of demonstrators gathered across the street from the White House in Lafayette Square. Here\u2019s the AP report: </p> \n  <blockquote> \n   <p>Protesters <strong>hurled pieces of bricks, bottles and other objects at Secret Service and US Park Police officers</strong> who were in riot gear behind barricades around the White House. Protesters at times kicked and punched officers and wrestled over the barricades.</p> \n   <p>The crowd of hundreds chanted \u201cNo justice, no peace\u201d and \u201cSay his name: George Floyd\u201d.</p> \n   <p>As some in the crowd grew more aggressive, <strong>police deployed pepper spray </strong>to maintain a perimeter of officers around the White House. Demonstrators came to the aid of protesters who were sprayed, their eyes red and puffy, offering bottles of milk and water to splash on their faces.</p> \n   <p>By the end of the night, the protesters had stolen about 15 barricades and left police to form a line of officers holding riot shields to keep back the swelling crowd. At one point, the protesters were able to gain control of an officer\u2019s shield and set it ablaze before trying to toss it back at the line of officers. Police used a smoke device to quickly stop them.</p> \n   <p>The protest went on for hours before police declared the gathering \u201cunlawful\u201d and ordered everyone to leave the seven-acre public park. Dozens of officers pushed forward with their shields and <strong>fired off streams of pepper spray at protesters</strong>.</p> \n   <p>Some protesters broke the bricks from the pavement and hurled chunks at the officers.

He said he had not set a precise date for the new meeting, but suggested it might be around the time of the annual UN general assembly in New York, which is normally held in September, but there is no guarantee it will go ahead this year. The proposed \u201cG11\u201d meeting might also be held after the presidential election, he said.</p> <p>Trump caught many capitals and White House officials by surprise on 20 May, when he <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1263113203749453827\">tweeted</a>: \u201cNow that our Country is \u2018Transitioning back to Greatness,\u2019 I am considering rescheduling the G-7, on the same or similar date, in Washington, DC, at the legendary Camp David.

He had no official notification that the virus had arrived in his area in mid-March, and only found out when he logged on to the government\u2019s public coronavirus tracker web page to make his daily check on the declared numbers. Strelitz did not know who in Newham had Covid-19, where they had been tested, or which part of the borough they came from.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re really concerned about the way national testing has been set up,\u201d Strelitz said. \u201cWe still don\u2019t have a clear picture of who is being tested in our area nor of the extent of community transmission in Newham.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"81c1fc9fd1174ab1ca7d1417a9310c2de5419d02\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/81c1fc9fd1174ab1ca7d1417a9310c2de5419d02/1100_1065_4876_2927/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jason Strelitz at the Covid-19 hub for local authority action in Newham.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jason Strelitz at the Covid-19 hub for local authority action in Newham.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson/The Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In normal times, a Public Health England (PHE) representative would be expected to contact Strelitz\u2019s environmental health teams if a case of a notifiable disease was found in the area that needed following up, enabling them to set to work tracing contacts and containing an outbreak. But the government had just abandoned community testing and tracing so local authorities were not being contacted at that point.</p> <p>Newham is among the most deprived boroughs in the country. Like all the public health directors interviewed by the Guardian, Strelitz has deep knowledge of the characteristics of his patch that make its health inequalities so stark and its residents so vulnerable to the disease. About 30,000 people have been identified by the council as being at high risk \u2013 many of them over 70, living alone and isolated.</p> <p>Even now, with large-scale community testing resumed, Strelitz said he was not receiving useful test data from the centralised, privately contracted operation created by Hancock. He also has concerns about the contact-tracing operation being set up.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/generic/index.html?vertical=News&amp;opinion-tint=false&amp;title=Covid-19%3A%20help%20us%20investigate&amp;description=The%20Guardian%20is%20investigating%20how%20the%20UK%20government%20prepared%20for%20%E2%80%93%20and%20is%20responding%20to%20%E2%80%93%20the%20coronavirus%20pandemic.%20We%20want%20to%20learn%20more%20about%20recent%20decisions%20taken%20at%20the%20heart%20of%20government.%20If%20you%E2%80%99re%20a%20whistleblower%20or%20source%20and%20with%20new%20information%2C%20you%20can%20email%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22mailto%3Acovid19.investigations%40theguardian.com%22%3Ecovid19.investigations%40theguardian.com%3C%2Fa%3E%2C%20or%20(using%20a%20non-work%20phone)%20use%20Signal%20or%20%3Ca%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fapi.whatsapp.com%2Fsend%3Fphone%3D447584640566%22%3EWhatsApp%3C%2Fa%3E%20to%20message%20(UK)%20%2B44%207584%20640566.%20(The%20number%20does%20not%20take%20calls.)%20For%20the%20most%20secure%20communications%2C%20use%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fsecuredrop%22%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%3ESecureDrop%3C%2Fa%3E.%20For%20general%20advice%20on%20confidentially%20contacting%20the%20Guardian%2C%20see%20%3Ca%20href%3D%22https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fhelp%2Fng-interactive%2F2017%2Fmar%2F17%2Fcontact-the-guardian-securely%22%20style%3D%22color%3A%23ab0613%22%3Eour%20guide%3C%2Fa%3E.%20&amp;link=false\" data-alt=\"The Guardian is investigating how the UK government prepared for \u2013 and is responding to \u2013 the coronavirus pandemic.

Working on a salary just above minimum wage, the majority will have no medical training. Using scripts, they will contact those who have tested positive, trace people they have been in contact with, and advise them on how to isolate.</p> <p>\u201cContact tracing is a sensitive issue \u2013 I\u2019m not sure how well it can be done with a remote call centre with no understanding of people\u2019s local context,\u201d Strelitz said.</p> <p>Dominic Harrison, the director of public health for Blackburn and Darwen, has similar concerns. Speaking earlier this month he said there was \u201ca huge disconnect\u201d between different branches of government, with some functions of the local public health system having been disabled in recent years.</p> <p>\u201cPeople like environmental health officers, community and neighbourhood teams, youth services workers \u2013 the people who you could deploy in a crisis, who already know where the vulnerable are and how to reach them \u2013 those were the kind of staff they used during 2009 swine flu to work closely with the NHS, but they have been lost,\u201d Harrison said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"521ac9437d4b150001bbeea161c2256e8c59e7a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/521ac9437d4b150001bbeea161c2256e8c59e7a1/0_35_3878_2328/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Council workers in Hull disinfect pavements and structures to guard against the transmission of coronavirus.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Council workers in Hull disinfect pavements and structures to guard against the transmission of coronavirus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lindsey Parnaby/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Labour leader of Nottingham city council, David Mellen, said Conservative ministers had spent so many years shrinking the state locally \u201cthey have forgotten what local authorities can do\u201d. Nottingham has had its central government support grant cut by 80% since 2013 and, like many other councils, no longer has reserves for emergencies such as coronavirus. The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government has made an emergency grant of \u00a33.2bn to councils for Covid-19 costs, which the communities secretary, Robert Jenrick, has <a href=\"https://mhclgmedia.blog.gov.uk/2020/05/14/response-to-lewis-goodall-newsnight-on-local-authority-funding/\">defended</a> as fair and generous. Mellen disagrees. Nottingham, he said, had been given \u00a319.8m as its share of the exceptional grant, but had already spent well over \u00a312m extra on Covid-19 while losing at least \u00a319m in revenue because of the lockdown.</p> <p>A Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) spokesperson did not dispute that cuts to central government grants could have had an impact on local public health networks. However, she pointed to the \u00a33.2bn emergency funding for councils, which she said was in addition to an increase of \u00a32.9bn in councils\u2019 core spending power this year. \u201cProtecting the public\u2019s health is, and has always been, a priority for the UK government,\u201d she said.</p> <h2>A decade of austerity</h2> <p>Next month, Britain will mark an anniversary many Conservative ministers would rather forget. Shortly after 12.30pm on 22 June 2010, George Osborne stepped up to the dispatch box as chancellor of the new coalition government and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jun/22/emergency-budget-full-speech-text\">announced</a> the longest and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/jun/23/budget-longest-deepest-cuts-ifs\">deepest period of cuts</a> to public service spending since the second world war.</p> <p>Ushering in a new age of austerity to a raucous Commons, Osborne outlined \u00a381bn of cuts over five years. His aim was twofold: to eliminate the government\u2019s budget deficit and to reduce its debt as a share of GDP. The emergency budget would, he said, bring the country back from the brink of ruin. \u201cIt pays for the past. It plans for the future. And it protects the most vulnerable in our society,\u201d Osborne told MPs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&amp;number=60%25&amp;title=cut%20in%20local%20authority%20funding%20from%20government%20since%202010\" data-alt=\"60% cut in local authority funding\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&number=60%25&title=cut%20in%20local%20authority%20funding%20from%20government%20since%202010\">60% cut in local authority funding</a> </figure>  <p>It was the prime minister, David Cameron, who had the previous year introduced the notion of \u201cthe age of irresponsibility giving way to the age of austerity\u201d. He said he expected the public spending cuts would be permanent as the private and voluntary sectors stepped in to deliver public services better than the state could. Some government departments would be cut by a third and most public sector workers would have to accept a pay freeze.</p> <p>Along with welfare, some of the most brutal reductions were imposed on local government in England as Osborne transferred the political risk of austerity to councils. Over the next decade, local authorities had 60% of their funding from central government cut, <a href=\"http://www.local.gov.uk/sites/default/files/documents/5.40_01_Finance%20publication_WEB_0.pdf\">according to the Local Government Association</a>. At the same time their ability to increase council tax, to try to replace the lost revenue, was capped. The cuts <a href=\"https://www.ippr.org/blog/public-health-cuts#anounce-of-prevention-is-worth-a-pound-of-cure\">fell disproportionately</a> on those authorities with the poorest populations.</p> <p>Cameron promised he would \u201ccut the deficit, not the NHS\u201d and Osborne ringfenced its budget. It got cash increases, but these were less than 1% a year, and failed to keep pace with growing demand from an ageing population.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&amp;number=32%2C000&amp;title=overnight%20hospital%20beds%20cut%20in%20England%20since%202008-9\" data-alt=\"32,000 overnight beds lost since 2008-09\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&number=32%2C000&title=overnight%20hospital%20beds%20cut%20in%20England%20since%202008-9\">32,000 overnight beds lost since 2008-09</a> </figure>  <p>Approximately 32,000 overnight beds have been <a href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/statistics/statistical-work-areas/bed-availability-and-occupancy/bed-data-overnight/\">lost</a> from hospitals in England in just over a decade, including some lost under Labour. Allyson Pollock, a professor of public health at Newcastle University, points out that the number of beds lost is roughly the same as the beds the NHS had to scramble <a href=\"https://www.england.nhs.uk/2020/04/nightingale-ldn-discharges-first/\">to free up for Covid-19</a> patients.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&amp;number=33%2C000&amp;title=hospital%20beds%20reconfigured%20for%20Covid-19%20at%20the%20end%20of%20March\" data-alt=\"33,000 hospital beds reconfigured for Covid-19\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&number=33%2C000&title=hospital%20beds%20reconfigured%20for%20Covid-19%20at%20the%20end%20of%20March\">33,000 hospital beds reconfigured for Covid-19</a> </figure>  <p>When the coronavirus spread to Europe earlier this year, the UK ranked 24th among European countries for its numbers of <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00134-012-2627-8/figures/1\">critical care beds</a>, with 6.6 per 100,000 population, compared with Germany, which topped the league with 29.2 per 100,000.</p> <h2>NHS fragmentation</h2> <p>Two years after Osborne\u2019s announcement, with austerity beginning to bite, the then health secretary, Andrew Lansley, embarked on a complete market-oriented restructuring of the NHS. Despite Cameron\u2019s pre-election promise that there would be no more pointless, <a href=\"https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/publications/never-again\">disruptive top-down reorganisations</a>, critics argue that Lansley\u2019s 2012 Health and Social Care Act did just that.</p> <p>Labour had done its fair share of subjecting the NHS to upheaval. Its programme of building new hospitals under the private finance initiative required other hospital and community health services to close, and shrank bed numbers to help cover the high annual fees to private companies. It accelerated changes brought in by the Conservatives to mimic a market, and created NHS trusts that could operate as semi-autonomous corporate bodies. By 2006, Labour\u2019s reorganisations had created 152 primary care trusts (PCTs). Overarching priorities were set by regional strategic health authorities and the Department of Health.</p> <p>But every area still had a Public Health Observatory, which included infectious disease control teams. Under government pandemic plans, each had to identify rapid response teams for testing and tracing, and these were activated during the swine flu outbreak in 2009.</p> <p>Health authorities also had consultants in communicable disease control appointed at senior level on a par with NHS hospital consultants. An independent public body, the Health Protection Agency (HPA), provided specialist support on the threat of emerging diseases. There were critics of the structures, but in planning for emergencies there was, at least, a clear chain of command and control. \u201cLabour started the process of fragmenting public health but it was at least still integrated with communicable disease control and the NHS,\u201d Pollock said.</p> <p>Lansley\u2019s legislation did away with much of that. He abolished PCTs and strategic health authorities. Instead, existing public health structures were stripped out of the NHS and redistributed, along with their budgets and staff. In a dramatic shift, local authorities were given responsibility for public health for their areas, with larger ones being required to appoint a director of public health.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"77b765152eca3e8ecdfdd92638bb843b4263bb2c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77b765152eca3e8ecdfdd92638bb843b4263bb2c/0_200_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Andrew Lansley speaking with staff at Frimley Park hospital in 2011.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Cameron, Nick Clegg and Andrew Lansley speaking with staff at Frimley Park hospital in 2011.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThey took a perfectly well-functioning public health system and fractured it,\u201d said Julie Hotchkiss, a PCT director with responsibility for emergency pandemic response who moved to York city council during the changes. She said it took her a year to work out where her infectious disease control nurses had gone. \u201cNo one knew and there was no one to ask.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Jeanelle de Gruchy, the president of the Association of Directors of Public Health, argues it was right for local authorities to have a key role in tackling health inequalities, which tend to relate to people\u2019s living circumstances and socio-economic status. She regards the transfer of public health to local authorities as \u201cincredibly important and positive\u201d. But she adds: \u201cIt\u2019s a very big job and the transition came at a time of cuts to the public sector, not just to local government, although those were huge.\u201d</p> <p>Lansley\u2019s act also created an entirely new agency that has been at the centre of the response to the coronavirus outbreak: Public Health England. It was given two primary responsibilities: improving health and reducing inequalities by tackling \u201clifestyle\u201d diseases, such as obesity; and protecting the public from infectious diseases and environmental hazards.</p> <p>The HPA, which had previously taken a lead on infectious disease control, was folded into PHE. Martin McKee, a professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, argues the result of all these new arrangements was \u201ca hugely weakened and fragmented public health system with consequences writ large in Covid-19\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&amp;number=%C2%A3850m&amp;title=cut%20from%20the%20government%20public%20health%20grant%20to%20local%20authorities%20since%202015\" data-alt=\"\u00a3850m cut to public health grant since 2015\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&number=%C2%A3850m&title=cut%20from%20the%20government%20public%20health%20grant%20to%20local%20authorities%20since%202015\">\u00a3850m cut to public health grant since 2015</a> </figure>  <p>The DHSC rejected the suggestion that the system was fragmented and that changes had affected the government\u2019s ability to respond. Lord Lansley did too. He told the Guardian that an independent review of the public health changes from 2013 published by the <a href=\"https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/sites/default/files/2020-01/LGA%20PH%20reforms%20-%20final.pdf\">the King\u2019s Fund</a> thinktank in January, \u201cconcluded that they were the right reforms, but were not supported subsequently by the right level of resources\u201d. Combating health threats, such as pandemics, was \u201cno more or less fragmented\u201d after 2013, Lansley said, and the problem was not the new structures or moving public health to local government but money. \u201cOur intention was for a real-terms increase in public health budgets alongside those for the NHS, but this was not followed through from 2015 onwards,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The ringfenced annual grant for public health from central government to local authorities \u2013 currently about \u00a33.2bn \u2013 has been cut by a cumulative \u00a3850m in real terms since 2015-16, according to <a href=\"https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/sites/default/files/2020-01/LGA%20PH%20reforms%20-%20final.pdf\">the King\u2019s Fund</a> review.</p> <p>During his two-decade career in government, Scally had been involved in emergency responses for swine flu, foot and mouth, BSE, and the fuel crisis. For previous epidemics, he said, the government took \u201ca public health approach; go in quick and hard, test, trace, isolate, throw everything at it\u201d. But, he said, \u201cthe whole system was demolished\u201d by Lansley\u2019s changes, which led him to resign.</p> <p>He then worked as an adviser for Labour\u2019s former shadow health secretary, Andy Burnham, who is now the mayor of Greater Manchester. Burnham recalls Scally constantly warning him as Lansley\u2019s bill was going through parliament that \u201cwe were losing pandemic preparedness\u201d.</p> <h2>Testing time for Public Health England</h2> <p>No branch of government appears to have received more flak over its handling of the Covid-19 outbreak than Public Health England. The government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/england-coronavirus-testing-has-not-risen-fast-enough-science-chief\">suggested it had failed</a> to expand testing at the right moment. Its top executive has been criticised by leading public health experts, such as Prof Anthony Costello of University College London, for being \u201cinvisible\u201d.</p> <p>Even before the outbreak, the agency was a target of complaints from across the spectrum. Leftwing critics have accused PHE of failing to be tough enough in its role of promoting better health. The right has accused it of being the instrument of a nanny state with a bloated budget. PHE has had precious few political friends. But even those who might be natural allies \u2013 like Prof John Ashton, the former regional director of public health for north-west England \u2013 suggest it has \u201chad a bad Covid war\u201d.</p> <p>Some of this might be down to bad luck. Its chief executive, Duncan Selbie, caught the virus along with key advisers in Westminster, and its&nbsp;emeritus medical director and director for health protection&nbsp;until 2019, Prof Paul Cosford, has cancer and has been self-isolating, although both have been working throughout.</p> <p>However, there have also been structural challenges. The Lansley act created an agency that lacked independence from government, in contrast to its predecessor, the HPA. That has led to suspicions that some PHE decisions were politically influenced, such as the varying guidance on what kind of personal protective equipment (PPE) was needed for frontline staff treating Covid-19 patients. In late March, PHE said a lower specification of protective gowns than previously advised could be used, leading <a href=\"https://www.gmb.org.uk/news/trust-draining-away-over-dangerous-downgrade-ppe-guidance\">unions to accuse</a> it of basing decisions on shortages of PPE, rather than evidence.

The report only examined PHE and not the public health systems devolved to local authorities. The same report pointed out that \u201cthere is scope for greater clarity in the responsibilities of PHE\u2019s local partners\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&amp;number=%C2%A040%25&amp;title=cut%20to%20PHE%27s%20operational%20budget%20in%20real%20terms%20since%202013\" data-alt=\"40% cut to PHE operational budget\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/from-tool/number/index.html?vertical=News&number=%C2%A040%25&title=cut%20to%20PHE%27s%20operational%20budget%20in%20real%20terms%20since%202013\">40% cut to PHE operational budget</a> </figure>  <p>In its defence, PHE has had to absorb disparate functions since its creation in 2013. And it too has been struck by austerity: a public health source said PHE\u2019s operational budget sustained a 40% real-terms cut between 2013 and 2019.</p> <p>It was PHE that initially had responsibility for testing, tracing and advising isolation for those who became infected. It was a huge and complicated task, but one the World Health Organization has made clear from the outset was the single most important thing countries could do to suppress the disease. The government\u2019s decision to abandon large-scale testing and tracing on 12 March remains one of its most controversial decisions.</p> <p>PHE says it reprioritised limited resources rather than abandoning tracing completely. \u201cWhen the lockdown began, our contact-tracing resource was refocused on to complex outbreaks in care homes, prisons and immigration centres,\u201d Selbie said. \u201cThe good news is, now that we have testing capacity in place and are working towards recovery, we can start mass contact tracing through the NHS test and trace programme.</p> <p>\u201cPHE\u2019s contact tracing during the \u2018\u2018contain\u2019 phase of the pandemic bought several weeks of time for the government and the NHS to prepare for what was to come, and has undoubtedly saved lives,\u201d he said.</p> <ul> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus \u2013 latest updates</a></p></li> <li><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></p></li> </ul> <p>Greg Clark, the chair of the Commons science and technology select committee, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-52716828\">accused</a> PHE of choosing to \u201cconcentrate\u201d tests in its own limited number of labs rather than expanding capacity rapidly by using university and private labs, as the Germans and South Koreans had done, even though the need for mass testing was \u201cidentifiable from the beginning\u201d. PHE responded by blaming the DHSC, saying it was responsible for decisions on testing policy.</p> <p>The DHSC spokesperson said: \u201cAlthough Britain had a world-class pharmaceutical industry, it did not have the existing diagnostic base necessary to test hundreds of thousands of people each week for a new virus.\u201d She said the government had more than doubled the capacity of NHS and PHE laboratories since early March, with more than 3m tests carried out by mid-May, and that anyone with symptoms could now book a test.</p> <p>The government boasts that its new Test and Trace programme will mobilise an \u201carmy\u201d of contact tracers. But in the two months leading up to 12 March, PHE\u2019s team resembled no more than a small platoon. The Guardian has established it consisted of just 70 staff in its field services, 120 in local health protection teams, and 20 specially recruited clinical staff. In total, the contact tracing operation to manage the pandemic consisted of just 210 people.</p> <p>Documents released on Friday by the government\u2019s Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage) suggest the contact-tracing operation initially only envisaged the need to deal with a handful of cases a week. Minutes from an 18 February meeting of the group said: \u201cCurrently PHE can cope with five new cases a week (requiring isolation of 800 contacts).\u201d The minutes added: \u201cModelling suggests this capacity could be increased to 50 new cases a week (8,000 contact isolations) but this assumption needs to be stress-tested with PHE operational colleagues.\u201d</p> <p>Rather than ramp\u2013up capacity, the government scientists instead agreed in the same meeting they would need data \u201cto feed into trigger points for decisions on when the current monitoring and contact-tracing approach is no longer working\u201d. The minutes added: \u201cWhen there is sustained transmission in the UK, contact tracing will no longer be useful.\u201d</p> <p>PHE said&nbsp;the reference to five cases a week was based on modelling of how it would cope with tracking the contacts of imported cases of Covid-19. In a statement, it added:&nbsp;\u201cPHE&nbsp;could deal with 5 new cases a week&nbsp;and the associated isolation of 800 contacts \u2013 which was sufficient capacity at the time \u2013 and&nbsp;modelling suggested it had the capacity to scale up significantly as needed.\u201d</p> <p>However, two days later, at another Sage meeting, the advisers acknowledged \u201cindividual cases could already have been missed\u201d and again discussed when it would be appropriate to abandon the nascent operation. Appearing to acknowledge such a move would be controversial, the minutes said: \u201cAny decision to discontinue contact tracing will generate a public reaction&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;which requires consideration with input from behavioural scientists.\u201d</p> <p>By the time community tracing was shelvedin mid\u2013March, PHE had \u201ccontact traced\u201d only 3,500 people who were likely to have been in close proximity with infected people on flights, cruises or other places where there were known outbreaks. Of those, only 3% tested positive for Covid-19 and were advised to self-isolate.</p> <p>In other words, PHE had managed to identify and warn about 100 people with Covid-19 who might otherwise have spread the disease \u2013 a tiny fraction of the infected people. Vallance said there were <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/3c9cf7d0-3d11-443e-a156-d111b333fd72\">5,000 confirmed</a> Covid cases when the community testing and tracing programme stopped, but epidemiologists at Imperial College London <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/18/sage-advice-britain-coronavirus-science-government-policy\">estimated</a> 1.8 million people in Britain were infected by the end of March.</p> <p>William Hanage, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at Harvard University, said the numbers of PHE staff dedicated to contact tracing in Britain in the weeks leading up to mid-March was shocking. \u201cI am sure that the people involved in this programme worked incredibly hard, and I have the utmost respect for them, tasked with doing this in the face of a global pandemic,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it beggars belief to see these numbers held up as adequate.\u201d</p> <h2>The elusive 100,000 target</h2> <p>On 2 April, three weeks after capacity had been overwhelmed and PHE had abandoned testing in the community, Hancock <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/health-secretary-sets-out-plan-to-carry-out-100000-coronavirus-tests-a-day\">announced</a> a five-pillar testing plan. He pledged to scale up the country\u2019s testing capacity to reach a target of 100,000 tests a day by the end of the month.</p> <p>But the architecture created in the postwar years to respond to pandemics was no longer standing. In the past, the Public Health Laboratories Service had been tasked with disease control, and with coordinating support and advice to the NHS and others. In 2003, Labour folded it into the HPA. Fifty PHLS labs that existed two decades ago have been merged with hospital labs or \u201cconsolidated\u201d by successive governments to make efficiency savings. As of January this year, just eight laboratories remained under direct PHE control, along with <a href=\"https://improvement.nhs.uk/resources/pathology-networks/\">122 NHS labs</a> in England.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d3d2ce9475aa9eb47dab9844d522a3a941cb52e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3d2ce9475aa9eb47dab9844d522a3a941cb52e6/0_49_3529_2118/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matt Hancock giving one of Downing Street\u2019s daily coronavirus press briefings.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matt Hancock giving one of Downing Street\u2019s daily coronavirus press briefings.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pippa Fowles/10 Downing Street/AFP via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Hancock expected hospital labs testing patients and staff and PHE to make up 25,000 of the ambitious 100,000 target. For the other 75,000 he turned to the private sector. Deloitte, one of the big four accountancy firms, was asked to set up a network of 50 drive-through rapid testing centres, and yet more private companies, such as Serco, Sodexo, Mitie and G4S, would operate and manage the day-to-day running of them.</p> <p>A lab network to process the tests was also established. Deloitte was again given the coordinating role in the creation of new Lighthouse labs in Milton Keynes, Glasgow, Belfast and Cheshire and a further facility in Cambridge, with day-to-day running entrusted to a coalition of private and public partners, including universities and drug companies.</p> <p>But Hancock\u2019s 2 April announcement made no mention of one of the main purposes of testing: tracking or tracing.</p> <p>The Guardian soon <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/23/hospitals-sound-alarm-over-privately-run-test-centre-in-surrey\">received reports</a> from people trying to get tested of chaos at some sites, with results going astray, dangerously leaking swab samples arriving at labs, queues of more than three hours and symptomatic people being unable to book a test or told to make round trips of more than 100 miles to test centres. Many still report results taking seven to 10 days to arrive \u2013 too long to be useful for quarantine purposes \u2013 but the DHSC maintains that 97% of test results are obtained within 48 hours.</p> <p>In the last week of April, the government <a href=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/2425455/\">changed its criteria</a> for counting tests to include ones that had been dispatched, even if they had not been received, returned or processed. The date of 30 April came and Hancock missed his 100,000 target; the number of tests conducted that day was 81,611. But the next day, on 1 May, he appeared to smash it, as 122,347 tests were recorded in government data. The magic number had, by Hancock\u2019s own admission, included nearly 30,000 postal tests sent out but not yet analysed. By 3 May the number was back down to 76,496, and the government would fail to meet its target for the next seven days, before getting back on track on 11 May.</p> <p>For Chris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents foundation trusts in England, Hancock\u2019s single-minded focus on reaching an arbitrary number cost the country another precious month. \u201cToo much of April was wasted by focusing on the 100,000 tests by 30 April target at the expense of other aspects of a clear strategy,\u201d he said. \u201cThe testing strategy, if there was one, got hijacked on the basis of just meeting that target when there were lots of other things that needed to be done.\u201d</p> <p>Hopson said the saga also illustrates the danger of trying to control testing from the centre. \u201cWe need to be ready to do test, track and trace in every part of the country. That can only be done effectively with greater local control.\u201d</p>",

  "<p>What next in Beijing\u2019s master plan for China\u2019s global advancement? Anyone looking for details would have struggled to find them last week at the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82UME5egprg\">press conference</a> held by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/li-keqiang\">Li Keqiang</a>, with the Chinese premier much more focused on the ruling party\u2019s perils on the home front.&nbsp;</p> <p>The \u201cwolf warrior\u201d diplomacy, the world of blustering threats that Beijing has been using to bend countries to its bidding, was absent. Instead Li\u2019s focus in the 90-minute event was much more that of a nerdy economic policymaker. In the kind of minute detail redolent of the boss of a small provincial city, the premier listed an array of support measures for the economy: tax cuts for small business, reforms to medical and unemployment insurance, and support for the gig economy.</p> <p>The reason for Li\u2019s focus was obvious. China might have been the first major country out of (as it was the first into) the Covid-19 crisis, but its economy suffered a brutal contraction along the way, leaving a jobless rate of about 20%.&nbsp;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d3a49c64ab6a9b5eae5f68346556d9f20e28287\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d3a49c64ab6a9b5eae5f68346556d9f20e28287/424_245_4387_2633/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Li Keqiang gives a video press conference\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Li Keqiang gives a video press conference after the closing of the third session of the 13th National People\u2019s Congress on 28 May 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: China News Service/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The premier\u2019s annual press conference, held at the end of the annual session of the National People\u2019s Congress, China\u2019s legislature \u2013 delayed by nearly three months because of the virus \u2013 is a keenly watched event, at home and abroad. There were no questions on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/uighurs\">Uighurs</a> or re-education camps in Xinjiang, China\u2019s recent border clashes with India, its trade war with Australia or the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/27/huawei-meng-wanzhou-canada-court-ruling-us-extradition\">detention of a Huawei executive in Canada</a>, issues the government didn\u2019t want to air. Likewise, the queries on the economy, the origins of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/13/10-days-battle-wuhan-covid-19-testing-plan\">Covid-19 in Wuhan</a>, deteriorating relations with Washington, and the new Hong Kong security law were all softballs for Li, who is effectively Xi Jinping\u2019s deputy.&nbsp;</p> <p>But even if <a href=\"https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/zxxx_662805/t1783859.shtml\">the questions </a>from foreign and local reporters are cleared by the government beforehand, it is still the only moment in each calendar year in which a top leader appears at length in public and has to state the government\u2019s case. The focus on the economy, then, was telling. For a ruling party that has built legitimacy on near continuous high-speed growth since the late 1970s, the current downturn is a bracing moment. Tens and perhaps hundreds of millions have lost jobs. Those still in employment have had incomes sharply reduced, cutting into consumption. With the US, Europe and Japan in deep recessions, exports cannot take up the slack.</p> <p>To be sure, Beijing has not let its regional and global ambitions lie fallow during Covid-19 and its aftermath, with navy patrols in the South China Sea and the airforce sorties around Taiwan both continuing. And in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/hong-kong\">Hong Kong</a>, the most volatile issue on China\u2019s plate, the city\u2019s democrats have been placed firmly in the party\u2019s sights.</p> <p>With the passage of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/china-vote-npc-national-security-laws-hong-kong-us-protest\">a new national security law</a> by the NPC last week, China is making a big bet that it can stamp out its political opponents in the former British colony without killing off its vital role as a financial centre. The bill\u2019s vaguely worded offences, outlawing subversion, secessionist sentiment and foreign interference, will be interpreted widely, as they are in China itself, to round up any critics Beijing wants to target.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"b59b4b860fa111ad3a64b9a3c80a4349227d6e75\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b59b4b860fa111ad3a64b9a3c80a4349227d6e75/752_36_2248_2810/800.jpg\" alt=\"A demonstrator holds up a British national (overseas) passport in front of a Hong Kong colonial flag in shopping mall\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A protester holds up a British national (overseas) passport in front of a Hong Kong colonial flag in a shopping mall.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kin Cheung/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/28/uk-will-extend-visas-for-300000-hong-kong-residents-says-raab\">The UK\u2019s suggestion</a> that it would offer a path to citizenship for Hong Kong holders of British national (overseas) passports wanting to leave the territory prompted a sardonic thumbs-up in Beijing. \u201cThe potential UK move has won overwhelming support from Chinese internet users,\u201d said the <em>Global Times</em>, the party\u2019s tabloid attack dog. \u201c[They] said all traitors should be sent to the UK as they are unwanted on Chinese territory.\u201d</p> <p>But no one in Hong Kong thinks the fight will be over quickly, especially as Beijing\u2019s plan for its takeover of the territory\u2019s political system, and opposition to it, is so comprehensive.</p> <p>\u201cThey will send down cadres from the Chinese Communist party to supervise the government, the executive, the legislature, and more importantly, the judiciary. This is only the beginning, I tell you,\u201d Martin Lee, the barrister and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/24/i-wont-allow-this-to-be-the-end-of-hong-kong-campaigner-on-his-long-fight-for-democracy\">veteran democrat leader</a> said on Friday.</p> <p>In his press conference, Li offered only platitudes on the US relationship but said enough to confirm that bilateral ties between the two superpowers, one rising, the other in relative decline, will not get better soon. There is no off ramp for the US and China for the moment, as it is clear that neither country is looking for one. Washington feels it is playing catch up in muscling up to Beijing, a debate that will only be sharpened in a presidential election year. And China under Xi is programmed not to take a backward step.</p> <p>It is possible that the weakness in both countries\u2019 economies could temper their hardline positions this year, because neither wants to hurt growth any more than it has been already by Covid-19. Equally, Donald Trump might slap new sanctions on China at any time in a heated election campaign, to reinforce his narrative that he has been uniquely tough on China and that Joe Biden, his expected Democratic challenger, by comparison, will be weak. Beijing has made sure to retaliate against any economic sanctions imposed by Trump so far. It is an open question as to whether their calculation will change in an election year.</p> <p>One standout from Li\u2019s appearance before the media was his focus on the importance of the private sector to China\u2019s economic recovery. Xi\u2019s support for the state sector, and his lip service to the private economy, which drives Chinese growth and employment, has alienated many of the country\u2019s entrepreneurs. A number of wealthy business leaders who crossed Xi have been jailed. But Li, who has been overshadowed in office by Xi, took a different line, though whether support for the private sector can be sustained in a grim political climate, however, remains to be seen. Xi will not tolerate any rivals, especially in the form of rich entrepreneurs.</p> <p>\u2022 Richard McGregor is a senior fellow at the Lowy Institute in Sydney and is the author of numerous books on Chinese politics and foreign policy</p>",
  "<p>Like many Twitter debates, the war of words that broke out last week between Donald Trump and the social media company may seem inconsequential, even infantile. However, the spat raises important questions about the relationship between the public, technology companies and the state, especially in a polarised America.</p> <p>On Tuesday, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1265838823663075341\">Twitter attached a health warning</a> to two tweets by Donald Trump about postal ballots, urging users to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1265255835124539392\">\u201cget the facts\u201d</a>. Two days later, a furious Trump <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/donald-trump-social-media-executive-order-twitter\">retaliated with an executive</a> order threatening to curtail legal protections for social media companies. Twitter then upped the stakes by labelling a later Trump tweet about the Minneapolis riots as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1266231100780744704\">\u201cglorifying violence\u201d</a>.</p> <p>At first sight, the issues are straightforward. Twitter did not censor Trump\u2019s tweets, but merely alerted readers to <a href=\"https://pen.org/press-release/trump-lashes-out-against-twitter-fact-check/\">factual or ethical problems</a>. Trump\u2019s executive order, on the other hand, menaced free speech, threatening legal sanctions as retribution. Free speech for Trump seems to mean the right not to be criticised.</p> <p>Behind all this, however, lie deeper questions about the regulation of social media and its role in society. Trump\u2019s executive order targets <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/issues/cda230\">section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act</a>. It\u2019s an obscure piece of US law that is, as the campaigning group Electronic Frontier Foundation observes, \u201cone of the most valuable tools for protecting freedom of expression and innovation on the Internet\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Free speech for Trump seems to mean the right not to be criticised</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Section 230 excludes online platforms from most liabilities for content published by others, while allowing them to provide \u201cgood faith\u201d moderation of users\u2019 comments. Both are crucial not just for Silicon Valley behemoths but for newspapers and bloggers and any online site with which users interact or on which they can post comments.</p> <p>Twitter and Facebook are private companies but also, as the US supreme court has observed, serve as <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/16pdf/15-1194_08l1.pdf\">\u201cthe modern public square\u201d</a>. This makes them ideal tools for governments to, in the words of Daphne Keller, of Stanford University\u2019s cyber policy centre, <a href=\"https://www.hoover.org/sites/default/files/research/docs/who-do-you-sue-state-and-platform-hybrid-power-over-online-speech_0.pdf\">\u201claunder state action\u201d</a> \u2013 that is, use them to enforce regulation usually in the state\u2019s domain. European nations are very good at pressing tech giants to \u201cvoluntarily self-regulate\u201d, for instance by censoring speech deemed offensive or controversial.</p> <p>Protections in other countries including in Europe are not as robust as in America. That\u2019s why Section 230 has long been a target for US politicians, both liberal and conservative. The Democrats\u2019 <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/01/17/opinion/joe-biden-nytimes-interview.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share\">Joe Biden has gone even further than Trump</a>, calling for section 230 \u201cimmediately [to] be revoked\u201d.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s threat to Twitter is blatant and serves his narrow political ends. But many US politicians want America to be more like European nations, more easily able to use tech companies as proxies for the state. The result will not be to tame Silicon Valley but to disempower the public and constrain its use of the online public square.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The idea that the little people should be scrutinised, but not politicians, leaves a bad taste in the mouth</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Trump\u2019s feud with Twitter also raises questions about how to deal with misinformation. Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg distanced himself from Twitter by suggesting private companies should not be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/28/zuckerberg-facebook-police-online-speech-trump\">\u201carbiters of truth\u201d</a>. Except that Facebook already is. It boasts of \u201cfighting the spread of false news\u201d and ensuring that content declared by fact-checkers to be \u201cfalse\u201d is sanctioned. However, Facebook excludes politicians from its fact checking. The idea that the little people should be scrutinised, but not politicians, leaves a bad taste in the mouth.</p> <p>And yet, Zuckerberg has a point. In a polarised world, fact-checking itself can become a politicised process. As Covid-19 debates reveal, judgments about what is true and whom to trust are not straightforward, even in scientific and medical spheres. Twitter\u2019s fact checking of Trump\u2019s tweet was itself, as the tech magazine <em>Wired</em> observed, misleading. Fact-checkers, <em>Wired</em> pungently noted, \u201care often just as full of shit as the politicians they\u2019re debunking\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s not that lies should not be challenged, nor that there is no such thing as truth, nor yet that we should accept Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway\u2019s insistence that lies are just <a href=\"https://time.com/4642689/kellyanne-conway-sean-spicer-donald-trump-alternative-facts/\">\u201calternative facts\u201d</a>. It is rather that what people accept as \u201ctruth\u201d depends partly on whose authority they are willing to trust. In a political climate in which trust is fractured, so, inevitably, are conceptions of truth and falsity.</p> <p>Debunking lies, and holding politicians to account for their statements, is vital. The challenge we face, however, is primarily political, not factual or technological. That\u2019s why the problem of misinformation seems so difficult to solve \u2013 there are no simple technological or factual fixes to deep-set political conundrums.</p> <p>\u2022Kenan Malik is an Observer columnist</p>",

They are conducted without regard for civilian lives, the <a href=\"https://www.icrc.org/en/war-and-law/treaties-customary-law/geneva-conventions\">Geneva conventions</a> regulating armed conflict, or the interests of host populations in whose name they are fought.</p> <p>Great moral crusades, famous causes and genuine ideological struggles are few and far between. Modern wars are mostly about power and treasure.

Here, as elsewhere, rival rulers claim to be upholding order or fighting \u201cterrorism\u201d while, in reality, they seek to extend national influence and economic advantage. As long as these aims remain unmet, they show scant interest in peace.</p> <p>Ambitious states have always sought to dominate neighbours in the way China, for example, is doing now. One reason this happens more frequently today, and more anarchically, is declining American engagement.</p> <p>In the Middle East and Africa, the US \u2013 no longer a global policeman \u2013 is focused on supporting Israel, squeezing Iran and selling arms, to the exclusion of almost all else. In Asia, it is in retreat.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/archive-zip/giv-3902ongRW5pELIXK/\" data-alt=\"countries with perpetual conflicts\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2020/05/archive-zip/giv-3902ongRW5pELIXK/\">countries with perpetual conflicts</a> </figure>  <p>Donald Trump, desperate for a Nobel peace prize, offered to mediate the<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2018/jun/12/trump-and-kim-document-analysis-singapore-agreement-denuclearisation\"> 70-year-old North Korea-South Korea stand-off</a>.

Few take him seriously. Otherwise, his administration has shown zero interest in global conflict resolution.</p> <p>A related factor is the collapse of the western-led consensus favouring multilateral, collaborative approaches to international problems. This is matched by the parallel rise of authoritarian and populist regimes that prioritise narrow national interest over perceptions of the common good.</p> <p>This trend, a regression to the pre-1914 era of competing European nation-states, undermines <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/24/the-observer-view-on-the-failure-to-secure-a-global-ceasefire-during-the-pandemic\">the authority of the UN</a> and cooperative regional platforms such as the EU and African Union. Unsupported, UN peace envoys from Syria to Myanmar and peacekeeping operations across Africa struggle to make headway.</p> <p>Ineffective international law enforcement, symbolised by the inability of the International Criminal Court to deliver justice to war zones such as Iraq and Ukraine, helps freeze or perpetuate conflicts rather than justly resolve them. Demographic and physical causes also contribute to chronic instability.</p> <p>Conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Sahel and Sudan is fuelled by the fact that millions of young men in Africa, where the <a href=\"https://mo.ibrahim.foundation/news/2019/africas-first-challenge-youth-bulge-stuck-waithood\">median age is 19.8</a>, lack fulfilling work or a meaningful stake in their country\u2019s future. Long-running inter-state or intra-state violence is also rooted in the climate crisis and resulting resource scarcity, poverty and dislocation.</p> <p>New technologies and weapons such as drones and cyber warfare are lowering the up-front cost of conflict while enlarging potential theatres of war. Global warming is turning the newly accessible Arctic into <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/24/trump-greenland-gambit-sad-sign-arctic-up-for-grabs\">a vast, pristine battleground</a>. Outer space presents infinite possibilities for violence.<br><br>Religious wars are often the most bitterly fought and hardest to halt. As in the past, multiple collisions of faith, culture and values between Christians, Jews, Muslims, Hindus and other belief systems are key elements in the early 21st century\u2019s insatiable addiction to war.</p> <p>The Muslim world is also divided internally, between the Shia and Sunni traditions and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/24/islamic-state-is-back-and-this-time-the-west-is-ill-prepared-to-take-it-on\">fundamentalist</a> and secular interpretations of Islam. These schisms have been depicted by the Arabic noun <em>fitna</em>, which can mean both \u201ccharm, enchantment, captivation\u201d and \u201crebellion, riot, discord, civil strife\u201d.<br><br>Fitna is a fitting word for describing not only the Islamic sphere but the troubled state of the world as a whole in 2020, beset as it is by wars without end. For many people, if they are honest, war has a fatal attraction. As WB Yeats noted after the 1916 Easter Rising in Ireland, violent conflict can spawn a \u201cterrible beauty\u201d \u2013 a mix of fascination and horror that is difficult to forswear.</p> <h2>Syria</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1db9b5d5e8641afe4282a1891e44cabfa6996826\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1db9b5d5e8641afe4282a1891e44cabfa6996826/0_297_4606_2763/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Imam and orphans\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Syrian imam Ahmed al Qasir breaks his fast during an iftar meal with orphans on 6 May 2020.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>War began: March 2011</strong><br>An initially peaceful uprising against the autocratic presidency of Bashar al-Assad formed part of the 2011 Arab Spring revolts. It quickly turned into full-scale war as Assad\u2019s regional foes, notably Saudi Arabia, seized a chance to overthrow a regime allied with Iran. Since then upwards of<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Syrian_Civil_War\"> half a million people </a>are estimated to have died. </p> <p>The US and Europe also sought to install a friendly, pro-western government in Damascus. As Assad\u2019s grip on power weakened, Russia, supported by Iran, intervened in 2015 to stave off collapse and thwart western ambitions. Other interventions came from Turkey and from Islamic State jihadists, who declared a caliphate in Syria and Iraq.</p> <p>The war continues in the north-western province of Idlib, the last rebel-held stronghold, to which millions have fled. A current ceasefire is not expected to last. There are also fears that up to 100,000 people could die there if Covid-19 spreads in crowded refugee camps. Dr Munzer al-Khalil, head of Idlib\u2019s health directorate said: \u201cIf we do not get more support and equipment, we know we will not be able to cope. The people of north-west Syria have been through enough.

The elected Afghan government remains weak and divided, while the Taliban are resurgent. Pakistani, Indian, Iranian and Russian interference is a constant problem.</p> <p>The US is now seeking to cut its losses and leave. But a controversial \u201cpeace deal\u201d has failed to take hold. It is <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/26/world/asia/afghanistan-troop-withdrawal-election-day.html\">widely viewed</a> as a mere fig-leaf for an American troop withdrawal intended to boost Donald Trump\u2019s re-election chances.<br></p> <p>At least 100,000 Afghans are estimated to have died since 2001, although the true figure, including deaths from indirect causes, is almost certainly much higher.

Fighting has compounded perils posed by extreme poverty, malnutrition, cholera, climate change, religious extremism and now, Covid-19.<br></p> <p>A ceasefire arranged as a result of the pandemic ended last month despite UN efforts to advance a peace process. Now the war seems to be escalating again, with <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/05/yemen-saudi-led-coalition-downed-houthi-drone-najran-200527173907748.html\">new missile attacks</a> reported last week.

Unicef says 12 million children need humanitarian assistance.<br></p> <p>The impasse owes much to the fact the main protagonists \u2013 the Yemeni government, led by exiled president Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi, and the Houthi rebel movement, which represents Yemen\u2019s Zaidi Shia minority \u2013 are backed by regional rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran respectively.

He uses the platform to threaten war, hire and fire staff, goad perceived foes and stoke partisan divisions. Twitter, which did not exist 15 years ago, has become one of the most famous companies in the world, the new first draft of presidential history.</p> <p>But now the relationship is on the rocks.</p> <p>For the first time, Twitter this week added a factchecking tag to two of Trump\u2019s tweets when he made unsubstantiated claims of fraud in mail-in voting. The president struck back on Thursday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/28/donald-trump-social-media-executive-order-twitter\">with an executive order</a> threatening social media companies with new free speech regulations.</p> <p>Asked if he had considered deleting his account, Trump replied: \u201cIf we had a fair press in this country, I would do that in a heartbeat. There\u2019s nothing I\u2019d rather do than get rid of my whole Twitter account.\u201d</p> <p>A day later, in another first, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/29/twitter-hides-donald-trump-tweet-glorifying-violence\">Twitter hid a tweet</a> by Trump behind a warning accusing him of breaking its rules by \u201cglorifying violence\u201d in a message that said looters at protests in Minneapolis would be shot. The president lashed out again in \u2013 naturally \u2013 a tweet, complaining: \u201cTwitter is doing nothing about all of the lies and propaganda being put out by China or the Radical Left Democrat Party.

As for Trump, whose election owed much to social media, he now appears to be biting the hand that feeds him.</p> <p>\u201cI think the last thing Trump wants is to shut down Facebook, YouTube and Twitter,\u201d said <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Moonalice?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Roger McNamee,</a> author of Zucked: Waking Up to the Facebook Catastrophe. \u201cHe\u2019s completely dependent on them and, by the way, they on him. The symbiosis is complete.</p> <p>\u201cNow, I think what Twitter did relative to the looters and shooters tweet is actually very brave. It\u2019s also incredibly obvious and something they should\u2019ve done years ago, and something Facebook should do, because if you look at the public safety aspect of the terms of service, that tweet is an obvious violation and, coming from the president, it has enormous risk of causing public safety harm.\u201d</p> <p>McNamee, a co-founder of the private equity firm <a href=\"https://elevation.com/\">Elevation Partners</a> and an early investor in Facebook, Google and Amazon, added: \u201cThe fact that Facebook left it up speaks volumes about the different approaches of the two companies because how big do you think Twitter is without Trump? Is it half its current size? Is it less than that? This is a very brave thing for them to do.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s use of Twitter offers <a href=\"https://www.thefortyfifth.us/\">a real-time window on his consciousness</a> at all hours of day and night. Some of his posts are vivid reactions to items he has seen on the Fox News network. Others hurl insults at political foes and the media or traffic in incendiary racism. In the past month they have reached a crescendo of abuse, demagoguery and conspiracy theories, including <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/may/26/lori-klausutis-husband-asks-twitter-delete-trump-joe-scarborough-smears-death\">a baseless accusation of murder</a> levelled at a TV host.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/SykesCharlie?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Charlie Sykes,</a> a conservative author and broadcaster, said: \u201cHis Twitter account has been central to his presidency and he\u2019s obviously obsessed with it. That\u2019s what makes this so strange: if he were to shut down Twitter, he obviously would deprive himself of a platform. If he succeeds in having the law changed, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/28/us/politics/trump-jack-dorsey.html\">it would backfire on him</a> because it would then make the social media platforms liable for his lies and his slanders.\u201d</p> <p>Like a much-hyped executive order in April that threatened to ban immigration, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/apr/21/trump-us-immigration-ban-pause-green-cards\">turned out to have numerous exceptions,</a> the bark of Thursday\u2019s executive order is likely to be worse than its bite.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"24460b80e751f78cb1e4d4ce47b44f337e52cc49\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/24460b80e751f78cb1e4d4ce47b44f337e52cc49/0_0_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump used the New York tabloids to similar trolling effect before Twitter and Facebook came along.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump used the New York tabloids to similar trolling effect before Twitter and Facebook came along.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It attacks legal protections that shield social media companies from liability for users\u2019 content, but a change in the law would require an act of Congress.

The willingness to use the full weight of federal government to go in and punish a private company for factchecking one of his tweets.</p> <p>\u201cTwitter did not censor his tweet. It answered his tweet with a factcheck. In other words, it answered speech with more speech, which is the way the first amendment is supposed to work.\u201d</p> <p>Trump expressed anger last year after <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/04/tech/trump-social-media-twitter-facebook/index.html\">Facebook banned seven users</a> including the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, rightwing media stars Milo Yiannopoulos and Laura Loomer, and Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, notorious for using antisemitic language. He and fellow conservatives have long claimed without evidence that Silicon Valley tech companies are biased against them.</p> <p>Twitter first announced in early 2018 that it would not block world leaders or remove their controversial tweets, though it subsequently announced that it could apply warning labels and obscure the tweets of world leaders if they used their accounts to threaten or abuse others. Despite this week\u2019s skirmishes, the prospect of the US president being banned still seems remote.</p> <p>Sykes commented: \u201cI think that\u2019s unlikely to happen. Banning Trump allows him to play the victim card and say, \u2018Look, I am the president and they won\u2019t let me speak\u2019. So it makes him a martyr. It\u2019s probably better to factcheck him. On the other hand, that\u2019s going to be extremely difficult. Are they going to factcheck every one of his tweets?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"200c345ae4c06bfd0195b085370db610cad79bd7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/200c345ae4c06bfd0195b085370db610cad79bd7/0_175_4500_2699/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump\u2019s Twitter page is displayed on a mobile phone on Thursday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump\u2019s Twitter page is displayed on a mobile phone on Thursday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Olivier Douliery/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cDoes that mean they\u2019re going to be under tremendous pressure to factcheck everyone else? There\u2019s a danger for Twitter that he will drag them down the rabbit hole, that he will make their factchecking of him into another massive distraction issue.\u201d</p> <p>Trump has put Twitter front and centre in public life but he is not its most followed personality. To his probable chagrin, THE No 1 spot is held by Obama with 118 million, <a href=\"https://www.brandwatch.com/blog/most-twitter-followers/\">according to Brandwatch,</a> ahead of singers Justin Bieber, Katy Perry, Rihanna, Taylor Swift, footballer Cristiano Ronaldo, singer Lady Gaga and TV personality Ellen DeGeneres.

I\u2019m not sure Twitter needs him and, if it does need him, then it\u2019s a flawed business model because Trump one day won\u2019t be with us. He\u2019s an old man and so if Twitter\u2019s business model depends on Donald Trump, it\u2019s a very short-lived business model.\u201d</p> <p>The president\u2019s threat to terminate his love-hate relationship with social media rings somewhat hollow. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/profiles/michael-dantonio\">Biographer Michael D\u2019Antonio</a> describes him as \u201ca troll at heart\u201d who used the New York tabloids to similar effect before Twitter and Facebook came along.

It\u2019s like the kid who\u2019s been let loose in a candy store and suddenly an adult says, \u2018Well, that\u2019s all done now, it\u2019s time for you to leave,\u2019 and he doesn\u2019t want to leave so he\u2019s having a tantrum.\u201d</p>",

During the 2016 election, Albright endorsed Hillary Clinton and intoned that \u201cthere\u2019s a special place in hell for women who don\u2019t help each other\u201d. In late 2017, Kissinger met in the Oval Office with Donald Trump. He has also acted as a go-between for the administration in its dealings with China. Albright\u2019s latest book is titled <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jul/08/madeleine-albright-fascism-is-not-an-ideology-its-a-method-interview-fascism-a-warning\">Fascism: A Warning</a>. For Kissinger, ideological virtue signaling takes a back seat. His legacy is realpolitik.</p> <p>Under the subtitle Henry Kissinger and His World, Barry Gewen delivers a highly readable biography of the 97-year-old diplomat. A longtime editor at the New York Times Book Review, Gewen looks to Leo Strauss, Hannah Arendt and Hans Morgenthau, all German-Jewish \u00e9migr\u00e9s and intellectuals, as prisms through which to refract Kissinger, a one-time Harvard professor.&nbsp;Strauss, Arendt and Morgenthau appear in names of chapters.</p> <p>The Inevitability of Tragedy treats Weimar\u2019s collapse as the formative event in Kissinger\u2019s life. The book\u2019s central premises are that democracies do not necessarily hold and that nations may be forced to choose from menus that offer only rancid dishes. From the author\u2019s perspective, unyielding moral codes may end up as burdensome ballast that leaves decision makers frozen. Or worse.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>More often than not, the author gives Kissinger the benefit of the doubt \u2013 even as the bodies pile up</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Gewen\u2019s prose is mellifluous even if his judgment of Kissinger remains debatable. The reader is drawn into the book\u2019s telling, regardless of possible disagreement. More often than not, the author gives Kissinger the benefit of the doubt \u2013 even as the bodies pile up.</p> <p>Against the backdrop of the the formulation and execution of Richard Nixon\u2019s Vietnam policy, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/feb/24/pinochet.bookextracts\">overthrow and assassination</a> of Salvador Allende in Chile, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/30/opinion/nixon-and-kissingers-forgotten-shame.html\">genocide in Bangladesh</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/jan/05/fordsshame\">East Timor</a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/feb/26/extract.features11\">a coup and&nbsp;invasion in Cyprus</a>, Kissinger was tagged as a \u201cwar criminal\u201d. On college campuses, he was even compared to Charles Manson, the convicted mass murderer.</p> <p>Although America elected Nixon to end the war, more than 20,000 US troops died on his watch. Sustaining American honor was a bloody undertaking that all involved knew couldn\u2019t be won. Daniel Ellsberg, leaker of the Pentagon Papers and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/daniel-ellsberg\">occasional Guardian contributor</a>, told the truth. Practically speaking, Nixon ended the draft in 1972 and inaugurated the volunteer army a year later.</p> <p>Gewen asks, \u201cWhat choices did Washington have when confronted\u201d by Allende\u2019s win at the ballot box? He poses the question of \u201chow to extricate\u201d the US from the \u201cmorass of Vietnam in a way that did the least damage to American interests\u201d. He does not regard the answers as self-evident.</p> <p>Quoting Morgenthau, one of the founding fathers of realism and a Kissinger friend, Gewen writes that the \u201cthe very act of acting destroys our moral integrity\u201d. He continues: \u201cWhoever wants to retain his moral innocence must forsake action altogether.\u201d To be sure, for senior government officials, inaction is almost an alien concept.</p> <p>Significantly, Morgenthau was an early critic of the Vietnam war. In 1965, Lyndon Johnson dismissed him as a state department adviser. On Vietnam, Morgenthau and Kissinger did not see eye-to-eye. Realpolitik does not necessarily lead to identical conclusions.</p> <p>Ping-pong diplomacy and the prospect of detente with Russia actually led to criticism of Kissinger. In 1974, Nixon resigned and by the time of the 1976 New Hampshire primary, Kissinger had emerged as a punching bag for Ronald Reagan and the right of the Republican party. The Manchester Union Leader, the storied New Hampshire daily, labeled Gerald Ford, the president, as \u201cthe jerk\u201d and Kissinger, his secretary of state, as \u201cthe kike\u201d.&nbsp;</p> <p>The Union Leader wasn\u2019t alone. The late Phyllis Schlafly, the leading opponent of the equal rights amendment and \u201c\u2018warrior queen of social conservatism\u201d, dangled Kissinger\u2019s otherness as catnip for opposition to Ford. In&nbsp;Kissinger on the Couch, Schlafly and co-author Chester Ward opined that he failed to understand \u201ctypical American values\u201d and alleged that his loyalty rested with a \u201csupranational\u201d order, not the US government. George Soros was the only thing missing from the equation.</p> <p>Kissinger was eternally grateful for the refuge the US afforded. But he remained ill at ease with his adopted country\u2019s Jacksonian populism. Parades weren\u2019t his thing.&nbsp;</p> <p>According to Gewen, the 1964 Republican convention \u201creminded Kissinger of the Nazi rallies he had witnessed as a boy in Germany\u201d. There, in San Francisco, Nelson Rockefeller, Kissinger\u2019s patron and New York\u2019s governor, vied unsuccessfully with Senator Barry Goldwater for the presidential nomination. Rockefeller would become Ford\u2019s vice-president.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c843f8d348fd7df2f929e90d8f748e50dde2bf7c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c843f8d348fd7df2f929e90d8f748e50dde2bf7c/0_0_1721_1032/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kissinger, newly appointed secretary of state, sits with Richard Nixon in the Oval Office in September 1973.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kissinger, newly appointed secretary of state, sits with Richard Nixon in the Oval Office in September 1973.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kissinger credits Reagan for the downfall of the Soviet Union, and saw him as possessing a greater grasp of the cold war than his advisers.

He supported the Iraq war, although not driven by the desire to bring democracy to the Gulf states. By contrast, Brent Scowcroft, Kissinger\u2019s successor at the national security council and later a business partner, predicted the pitfalls of a US invasion.

ministry said on Friday that the gritty industrial city of Ciudad Juarez, neighbouring El Paso, Texas, had received thousands of migrants under a Trump administration policy that sends US asylum seekers to Mexico to await the outcomes of their cases.</p> \n   <p>The migrants who have tested positive in the Leona Vicario centre, which houses 337 people, have been isolated.</p> \n   <p>\u201cPeople with Covid-19 symptoms receive medical treatment in a timely manner and remain in an isolation area to monitor their progress.\u201d </p> \n   <p>The infected migrants are from Brazil, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua, the director of the centre, Ivan Jimenez, said.</p> \n   <p>Fourteen migrants considered to be high-risk, including pregnant women and people with chronic medical conditions, were transferred to another facility.</p> \n   <p>Migrants in the shelter, one of Mexico\u2019s largest along the border, have been in isolation for more than two months, Jimenez said. </p> \n   <p>Many had found work in Ciudad Juarez but had been forced to give it up amid the pandemic.</p> \n   <p>The centre has supplied children with educational materials and hopes to resume more activities as cases among the migrants dwindle, Jimenez said.</p> \n   <p>\u201cIt\u2019s really horrible for people,\u201d he said. \u201cAbove all, our concern is for mental health.\u201d</p> \n

He also attacked the mayor for supposedly not providing police to protect the White House.</p> \n<p>\u201cThey let the \u2018protesters\u2019 scream and rant as much as they wanted, but whenever someone got too frisky or out of line, they would quickly come down on them, hard \u2013 didn\u2019t know what hit them,\u201d Trump said.</p> \n<p>Without evidence, the president claimed the protesters were \u201cprofessionally\u201d organized.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf they had [breached the fence],\u201d he said, \u201cthey would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen. That\u2019s when people would have been really badly hurt, at least.\u201d</p> \n<p>Bowser,<strong> </strong>a Democrat, said that she stood with peaceful protesters while Trump \u201chides behind his fence\u201d.</p> \n<p>\u201cTo make a reference to vicious dogs is no subtle reminder to African Americans of segregationists who let dogs out on women, children and innocent people in the south,\u201d Bowser said.</p> \n<p>She added: \u201cThere are no vicious dogs &amp; ominous weapons. There is just a scared man. Afraid/alone.\u201d</p> \n<p>On <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1266731291917062145\">Saturday</a>, Trump claimed the White House protest \u201chad little to do with the memory of George Floyd. They were just there to cause trouble \u2026 Tonight, I understand, is MAGA NIGHT AT THE WHITE HOUSE???\u201d</p> \n<p>That was seemingly a call for a counter-protest by his supporters, an event which would be likely to enflame tensions already running high.</p> \n<p>Trump also denounced Jacob Frey, the mayor of Minneapolis, and criticized the abandonment of a police station in the city that was besieged by protesters. He reiterated that he was prepared to intervene, with the military if necessary.</p> \n<p>\u201cWe have our military ready, willing and able if they ever want to call our military,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe can have troops on the ground very quickly.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Department of Defense <a href=\"https://apnews.com/cf9947a3ca9f3225f9645fd330403eae\">took the rare step</a> of putting military police units on alert to go to Minneapolis. The Minnesota governor, Tim Walz, had not requested such assistance. On Saturday morning, Walz said he had ordered the largest deployment of state national guard troops since the second world war.</p> \n<p>Speaking later in the day at Florida\u2019s Kennedy Space Center, Trump slightly changed his tone, announcing a civil rights investigation and painting himself as a supporter of those angered by Floyd\u2019s death.</p> \n<p>\u201cI stand before you as a friend and ally to every American seeking justice and peace. And I stand before you in firm opposition to anyone exploiting this tragedy to loot, rob, attack and menace,\u201d he said.</p> \n<p>But he also again lashed out at \u201cAntifa and the violent left\u201d whom he blames for protests spreading across the US.</p> \n<p>\u201cI understand the pain that people are feeling. We support the right of peaceful protestors and we hear their pleas. But what we are now seeing on the streets of our cities has nothing to do with justice or with peace,\u201d Trump said.</p> \n<p>\u201cThe memory of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/george-floyd\">George Floyd</a>&nbsp;is being dishonored by rioters, looters and anarchists. The violence and vandalism is being led by Antifa and other radical leftwing groups who are terrorizing the innocent, destroying jobs, hurting businesses and burning down victims.</p> \n<p>\u201cRight now, America needs creation not destruction, cooperation not contempt, security not anarchy, and there will be no anarchy. We cannot and must not allow a small group of criminals and vandals to wreck our cities and lay waste to our communities.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump\u2019s comments on Friday and Saturday<strong> </strong>were his latest potentially inflammatory response to protests which have erupted across the US over the death of George Floyd, a 46-year-old African American man who died while being arrested by police in Minneapolis.</p> \n<p>A white officer who knelt on Floyd\u2019s neck was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/29/derek-chauvin-police-officer-charged-george-floyd\">charged with murder</a> but violent protests have prompted national guard deployments, raising tensions everywhere.</p> \n<p>On Friday, Trump tweeted: \u201cWhen the looting starts, the shooting starts\u201d, a phrase with racist origins which&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/may/29/twitter-hides-donald-trump-tweet-glorifying-violence\">was censored by Twitter</a>.</p> \n<p>Trump claimed he hadn\u2019t known the inflammatory nature of the phrase, let alone had intended to call for violence against his own citizens.&nbsp;He also&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/1266478323556921344\">expressed</a>&nbsp;his \u201cdeepest condolences and most heartfelt sympathies to the family of George Floyd\u201d.</p> \n<p>Those words were more in keeping with those of Joe Biden, Trump\u2019s presumptive opponent at the polls in November. The former vice-president spoke to Floyd\u2019s family and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/30/george-floyd-killing-us-politics-trump-biden\">issued a video address in which he said</a>: \u201cThis is no time for incendiary tweets. This is no time to encourage violence. This is a national crisis, and we need real leadership right now.\u201d</p> \n<p>Protesters on Friday hurled bricks, bottles and other objects at Secret Service and US park police officers in riot gear behind barricades.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/30/george-floyd-killing-us-politics-trump-biden\">\u2018A national crisis\u2019: how the killing of George Floyd is changing US politics</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The crowd of hundreds chanted \u201cNo justice, no peace\u201d and \u201cSay his name: George Floyd\u201d.

Chanting \u201cI can\u2019t breathe\u201d, \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d and \u201cFuck Donald Trump!\u201d, hundreds of demonstrators circled the White House grounds.<br><br>Armored Secret Service, along with District of Columbia police and Park police, lined up in front of the protesters. Lafayette Square, the park in front of the executive mansion, was sealed off with steel barriers.<br><br>On Saturday evening, protesters overcame the barriers and entered the park but were driven out by police wielding shields, batons and pepper spray. Demonstrators damaged several Secret Service vehicles and threw themselves against officers\u2019 riot shields, the Washington Post reported.</p>"
