  "<p>Good morning, this is James Murray bringing you the main stories and must-reads on Tuesday 26 May.</p> \n<h2>Top stories</h2> \n<p><strong>Scott Morrison will today warn that government support measures are only a temporary form of \u201cmedication\u201d for a sick economy</strong> and microeconomic reforms will be needed to spur growth. In an address to the National Press Club the prime minister <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/25/morrison-says-support-measures-are-only-temporary-medication-for-sick-economy\">will put households, businesses and states who are expecting</a> further taxpayer support on notice. And in a special investigation, launched today, Guardian Australia <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/26/the-cliff-what-happens-when-australias-coronavirus-stimulus-runs-out-of-road\">looks at the impact </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/26/the-cliff-what-happens-when-australias-coronavirus-stimulus-runs-out-of-road\">of the government\u2019s recovery spending</a> and asks: what happens after September, when most of these measures run out?</p> \n<p><strong>China\u2019s trade bans are retaliation for Australia leading calls for an independent investigation into the origins of Covid-19</strong>, according to more than half of the respondents to the latest Guardian Essential poll. The survey finds strong support for the country\u2019s stance on \u201cstanding up to China\u201d and a huge decline in in those <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/26/chinas-trade-bans-are-retaliation-to-covid-19-inquiry-more-than-half-of-australians-say\">with a favourable view of the bilateral </a><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/may/26/chinas-trade-bans-are-retaliation-to-covid-19-inquiry-more-than-half-of-australians-say\"> trading relationship</a>. But respondents were split on whether Australia should avoid a trade war or impose its own tariffs on Chinese imports.</p> \n<p><strong>The world\u2019s deep oceans may experience climate change seven times higher than current levels by the second half of this century</strong>, even if global emissions are cut dramatically.<strong> </strong>The study, published in the journal Nature Climate Change, found different parts of the ocean would change at different rates as the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/may/26/climate-change-in-deep-oceans-could-be-seven-times-faster-by-middle-of-century-report-says\">extra heat from increasing levels of greenhouse gases moved through the vast ocean depths</a>. Prof Jorge Garc\u00eda Molinos, a climate ecologist at Hokkaido University and a co-author of the study, said: \u201cOur results suggest that deep sea biodiversity is likely to be at greater risk because they are adapted to much more stable thermal environments.\u201d</p> \n<p><strong>Boris Johnson\u2019s beleaguered political aide Dominic Cummings says he drove to popular tourist destination Barnard Castle during lockdown to test his eyesight. </strong>Cummings made the claim while refusing to resign over his alleged flouting of lockdown rules <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/25/uk-coronavirus-live-boirs-johnson-dominic-cummings-covid-19-latest-updates?page=with:block-5ecbe78b8f0864e579f176e5#block-5ecbe78b8f0864e579f176e5\">when he was symptomatic in April</a>. Cummings, who masterminded the Vote Leave campaign during the Brexit referendum, is under huge pressure to step down but has been backed by the prime minister, Boris Johnson.</p> \n<h2>Australia</h2> \n<p><strong>Lawyers for Drew Pavlou, a student facing expulsion over his pro-Hong Kong protests, have demanded that the University of Queensland sack the Chinese diplomat Xu Jie from his role as an adjunct professor</strong>.

The biggest reason for that change is China\u2019s rocketing demand for iron ore but the downside is that mining creates relatively few jobs compared with its effect on GDP. Most Australians work in the service sector, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2020/may/26/australias-buoyant-exports-are-good-news-for-gdp-but-less-so-for-households\">which saw an almost 10% fall in export value</a> in March.</p> \n<p><strong>If you now need cheering up, why not try reconnecting with nature while contributing to science with a bit of dunnart spotting. </strong>Scientists are asking the public to pick out wildlife in images of Kangaroo Island <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/may/26/armchair-expeditions-the-addictive-joy-of-dunnart-spotting\">as part of a survey of native animals</a>.

  "<p>When the Guardian/Observer and Mirror published fresh claims on Saturday night about Dominic Cummings potentially breaching lockdown rules, Downing Street refused to respond in detail and instead dismissed the outlets as politically motivated \u201ccampaigning newspapers\u201d.</p> \n<p>It is less clear whether No 10 holds the same dismissive view about the Conservative-supporting Daily Mail, which on Monday used a front-page editorial to demand Cummings is sacked and ran the story across 10 pages of furious coverage.</p> \n<p>Under the headline \u201cWhat planet are they on?\u201d, the newspaper\u2019s editorial said Cummings \u201cviolated the spirit and letter of the lockdown ... giving every selfish person a licence to play fast and loose with public health\u201d.</p> \n<p>Just months after enthusiastically cheering Boris Johnson to victory in the general election, the Mail directly attacked the prime minister for sticking by his chief aide: \u201cNeither man has displayed a scintilla of contrition for this breach of trust. Do they think we are fools? For the good of the government and the nation, Mr Cummings must resign. Or the prime minister must sack him. No ifs, no buts.\u201d</p> \n<p>In the process the newspaper set up a test of its power in the face of a government that has repeatedly made clear its disdain for traditional media outlets. It also serves as a check on whether print newspaper front pages still hold sway in an era of declining circulations and whether the Mail has broken the old newspaper editor\u2019s mantra that you should never launch a campaign that you are likely to lose.</p> \n<p>Charlie Beckett, a professor of media and communications at the London School of Economics, <a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/polis/2020/05/25/is-the-cummings-covid-scandal-showing-boris-johnson-as-the-british-trump/\">said </a><a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/polis/2020/05/25/is-the-cummings-covid-scandal-showing-boris-johnson-as-the-british-trump/\">while Johnson ha</a><a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/polis/2020/05/25/is-the-cummings-covid-scandal-showing-boris-johnson-as-the-british-trump/\">d not fully adopted the extreme attitudes towards the media</a> of the US president, Donald Trump, \u201che and his Downing Street team are certainly picking up on the details of the current White House approach\u201d of muddying the waters where possible.</p> \n<p>\u201cFor example, attacking the fact-based revelations in the Mirror and the Guardian as \u2018inaccurate\u2019 (in what way? tell us!) and as \u2018campaigning\u2019 journalism (implying it is partisan and discountable). It is similar to Trump\u2019s cry of \u2018fake news\u2019 about any hostile coverage. By attacking the motive of the accuser you avoid addressing the actual charge.\u201d</p> \n<p>The Daily Mail \u2013 which may now be the UK\u2019s biggest selling print newspaper after the Sun withdrew from official circulation figures last week \u2013 holds more political sway with the government. It is aided by directly setting the agenda among its largely Conservative-voted readership and also in terms of its perception among Tory MPs as an early warning system representing the views of Middle England.</p> \n<p>This attitude has led to recent Conservative governments repeatedly recruiting political journalists from the newspaper. James Slack, the prime minister\u2019s official civil service spokesperson, is a former Daily Mail political editor, while Johnson\u2019s recently hired political spokesperson is Jack Doyle, a former associate editor at the paper. The prime minister also employs as director of communications Lee Cain, a former reporter for the \u201ccampaigning newspaper\u201d Daily Mirror.</p> \n<p>Although the Times gave its backing to Cummings, other Tory-supporting papers also raised concerns. The Daily Telegraph, which employed the prime minister until he entered Downing Street, fell short of demanding Cummings\u2019s departure but said his presence was increasingly hard to justify, \u201cMr Johnson is determined to defend his adviser but he will be the one most damaged by dysfunctionality in the administration, something the country can ill afford.\u201d</p> \n<p>Even more damaging, the story continues to be the lead item on MailOnline, which may lack the same political punch but reaches many millions more Britons than its print sister.</p> \n<p>Cummings, who has been reportedly keeping a close eye on public opinion by <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/boris-johnsons-coronavirus-fudge/\">deploying private polling and focus groups throughout the pandemic</a>, appears to be betting the story will ultimately be perceived as a \u201cWestminster bubble\u201d issue only of interest to political obsessives.</p> \n<p>On Saturday, the prime minister\u2019s adviser and architect of the Vote Leave Brexit campaign told reporters outside his house they were misjudging the attitude of the nation: \u201cYou guys are probably all about as right about that as you were about Brexit: do you remember how right you all were about that?\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"17c1366f-b93c-407b-8834-0c66854f91fc\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sW0uLKo2-dw?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>",

  "<p>Sometimes Donald Trump portrays his election rival, Joe Biden, as a sleepy geriatric who should be in a care home because <a href=\"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/trump-to-salena-zito-joe-has-absolutely-no-idea-whats-happening\">\u201che doesn\u2019t know he\u2019s alive\u201d.</a> At others, the president speaks of Biden as a wily manipulator who conspired with the deep state <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/27/joe-biden-trump-coronavirus-politics-pandemic\">and China.</a></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/02/tara-reade-joe-biden-sexual-assault-allegations-democrats-response\">Who is Tara Reade and what are her allegations against Joe Biden?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But in this scattergun approach, the US president <a href=\"https://apnews.com/bb076f25d8372e67818ce1b241c86952?utm_source=piano&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=morningwire&amp;pnespid=1.RjqPpKWw6NiJzjzdrzJN_uW6MeIbVucw76JiBY\">has been uncharacteristically reluctant</a> to use what, in normal times, would seem standard political ammunition: an allegation of sexual assault.</p> <p>It took more than a month after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/04/joe-biden-tara-reade-senate-records-reject-request\">Tara Reade,</a> a former Senate staffer, alleged on a podcast that Biden sexually assaulted her in a Capitol Hill basement in 1993, for Trump to publicly address the matter.</p> <p>Even then, the US president\u2019s comments on 30 April were unusually milquetoast. \u201cI don\u2019t know anything about it,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-protecting-americas-seniors/\">Trump said</a>. \u201cI don\u2019t know exactly \u2013 I think he should respond. You know, it could be false accusations. I know all about false accusations. I\u2019ve been falsely charged numerous times. And there is such a thing.\u201d</p> <p>Then, speaking on Fox News\u2019s Fox &amp; Friends, usually a comfort zone, he again declined to go for Biden\u2019s jugular. \u201cLook, he\u2019s got to fight that battle,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve had battles, too, where I\u2019ve had false accusations, many times. I\u2019ve had many false accusations made, I can tell you that. Many. And maybe it is a false accusation. Frankly, I hope it is, for his sake.\u201d</p> <p>The first and most obvious explanation for the president\u2019s reticence is that he himself has been accused of assault and unwanted touching <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/assault-allegations-donald-trump-recapped\">by a long list of women,</a> some far more recently than Reade\u2019s account. He also denies the allegations. On the other hand, Trump has never allowed perceived double standards to get in the way of his scorched earth tactics in the past.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/09/donald-trump-women-bill-clinton-sex-scandal-hillary-debate\">Monika McDermott,</a> a political science professor at Fordham University in New York, said: \u201cIt\u2019s surprising in a way because usually Trump doesn\u2019t pull back on things even when they do seem hypocritical or ironic or choose your adjective. Yet he is in this particular instance. I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s waiting for something to happen or whether he\u2019s waiting to see how it plays out before he does anything. He seems to be finding what seem to him more fruitful attack routes against Obama and other things and people than against Biden right now.\u201d</p> <p>In 2016 Trump\u2019s campaign was rocked by the release of an Access Hollywood tape in which he could heard bragging about using his fame to grab women\u2019s private parts. Instead of quitting, he went on the offensive against his rival Hillary Clinton by highlighting sexual assault allegations against her husband, former president Bill Clinton, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/09/donald-trump-women-bill-clinton-sex-scandal-hillary-debate\">even inviting those accusers</a> to a press conference before a presidential debate.</p> <p>But this November will witness the first presidential election since the rise of the #<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/metoo-movement\">MeToo movement, </a>which has encouraged women to come forward with allegations of sexual assault against prominent men in politics, show business and other industries.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a08419f25771c1d33a7c3923efc31d0d7706410c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a08419f25771c1d33a7c3923efc31d0d7706410c/0_83_4252_2551/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A screen grab of Joe Biden and Dr Jill Biden hosting a family town hall on the Covid-19 pandemic from their home in Wilmington, Delaware, last month.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A screen grab of Joe Biden and Dr Jill Biden hosting a family town hall on the Covid-19 pandemic from their home in Wilmington, Delaware, last month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Cahn/Zuma Wire/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Biden has committed to picking a woman as his running mate and frequently cites his work as lead sponsor of the Violence Against Women Act. Both candidates are keenly aware that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/15/democrats-2020-election-suburbs-battle\">suburban women</a> could be a pivotal demographic in the final vote.</p> <p>While Trump remains taciturn, Republicans have instead focused much of their response on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/brett-kavanaugh\">Brett Kavanaugh,</a> the supreme court justice whose nomination was nearly derailed by sexual misconduct allegations. The Trump campaign pointed to statements made by Democrats during the Kavanaugh episode to portray them as hypocritical.</p> <p>Erin Perrine, principal deputy communications director at the Trump campaign, <a href=\"https://donaldtrumpcampaign.cmail19.com/t/ViewEmail/r/557A83AF845DEDEA2540EF23F30FEDED/078D62617DE962F44FB5D4CAE8F50064\">said:</a> \u201cDuring Justice Kavanaugh\u2019s hearings, Biden made clear that all women should be believed when they come forward with allegations of sexual assault. Biden\u2019s own work during the Obama administration lowered standards for such accusations on college campuses as to effectively institute a presumption of guilt. In a dramatic shift, Biden now says \u2018believe women\u2019 doesn\u2019t actually mean \u2018believe women.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Trump himself, however, has preferred to take aim at other targets, seeking to implicate Biden in a so-called <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/12/what-is-obamagate-and-why-is-trump-so-worked-up-about-it\">\u201cObamagate\u201d conspiracy</a> that many seen as an attempt to deflect attention from the coronavirus pandemic \u2013 likely to prove a more significant issue in November.</p> <p>Amid Democratic alarm that the Reade allegation could dent Biden\u2019s support among women, the former vice-president vehemently denied it in an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/may/01/joe-biden-denies-sexual-assault-allegation-tara-reade-statement\">interview on the MSNBC network</a> on 1 May and repeated that position in a series of media appearances.</p> <p>The story has faded from prominence in recent days, especially after <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/what-74-former-biden-staffers-think-about-tara-reades-allegations\">the PBS NewsHour interviewed</a> 74 former Biden staffers, of whom 62 were women, and found none said that they had experienced sexual harassment, assault or misconduct by Biden, nor ever heard rumors or allegations to that effect.</p> <p> By pushing the case, Trump may have more to lose than to gain. <a href=\"https://www.mullings.com/\">Rich Galen,</a> a former Republican strategist, said: \u201cThe case against Biden keeps getting thinner and thinner so I\u2019m not sure that there\u2019s much there. And all the people who\u2019s accused Trump, it would be like listing the names of the people who died in Vietnam every night.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MichaelSteele?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Michael Steele,</a> former chairman of the Republican National Committee, added: \u201cTrump, if nothing else, knows how to read his audience: \u2018No, they\u2019re not going to buy anything I sell on this point.\u2019 There\u2019s no need to even open that Pandora\u2019s box because it\u2019s a Pandora\u2019s box for him, not Joe Biden. I think that\u2019s why the president has largely decided not to engage at that level.</p> <p>\u201cMy sense is right now, despite what others in the campaign may want to do, there is no energy from the president himself to open up that door and go through it.\u201d</p>"
