It has never been triggered until now. <br><br>The EU statement said that ministers remained \u201cfully committed to the respect of the stability and growth pact\u201d.

He goes his own way. He has his own style. But on substantive issues, he does listen to what I say.\u201d</p> <p>Dr Fauci also described the process by which Trump prepares for briefings, which some say should not be carried live, given the president\u2019s use of the podium to attack reporters and his political enemies.</p> <p>\u201cWe sit down for an hour and a half,\u201d Dr Fauci said, \u201cgo over all the issues on the agenda.

Then he gets up and ad libs on his speech. And then we\u2019re up there to try and answer questions.\u201d</p> <p>Asked how often he disagreed with the president, Dr Fauci said: \u201cI don\u2019t disagree in the substance. It is expressed in a way that I would not express it, because it could lead to some misunderstanding about what the facts are about a given subject.\u201d</p> <p>He was also asked about a moment on Friday when Trump joked about the \u201cdeep state department\u201d and the doctor was seen to smile ruefully then rub his brow and jaw.

  "<p>In the words of John C Maxwell, the distinguished bestselling author of inspirational books, a true leader \u201cis one who knows the way, shows the way and goes the way.\u201d As Donald Trump continues to bluster his way through daily coronavirus briefings by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/20/trump-coronavirus-question-attack-reporter-over-fears\">picking fights with journalists</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/19/coronavirus-drug-trump-confusion-malaria-treatment-readiness\">contradicting the advice of medical experts</a>, the New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, is rising as an alternative guiding force for a nation in crisis \u2013 and the president\u2019s staff are beginning to take notice.</p> <p>Ostensibly, Cuomo\u2019s nationally televised addresses are aimed at the almost 20 million residents of a state affected <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/03/health/us-coronavirus-cases-state-by-state/index.html\">more than any other</a> by the virus.

In his nine years in the governor\u2019s mansion he has developed a reputation for forthright speaking, but also won praise for showing a personal and reassuring tone that has come to the fore in a series of briefings this week.</p> <p>On Sunday, he devoted a segment of his press conference to the emotional impact that self-isolation was having on families, particularly being closeted together for long periods of time. \u201cIt\u2019s complicated,\u201d he conceded. \u201cI live alone, I\u2019m even getting annoyed with the dog.\u201d</p> <p>As for hope, Cuomo had this message: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be hard, there is no doubt. But at the same time it is going to be OK. The grocery stores are going to function, there\u2019s going to be food, the transportation systems are going to function, the pharmacies are going to be open.

Life is going to go on, different, but life is going to go on.

  "<p>Donald Trump attempted to blunt growing criticism of the stalled federal response to the coronavirus crisis on Sunday night, promising that more help was on the way for states suffering a critical shortage of medical equipment, hospital beds and testing facilities.</p> <p>As the death toll from Covid-19 in the US<a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\"> rose to 417</a>, with more than 33,000 cases reported nationwide, increasing numbers of state and city leaders fired off warnings to the White House that a tipping point was near.</p> <p>Warnings were particularly strong from New York, where cases have risen sharply past 15,000 and now account for around half of those in the US.</p> <p>Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York city, said earlier in the day hospital supplies including ventilators, masks and surgical gloves would be exhausted within 10 days, while Andrew Cuomo, the governor of New York state, warned that up to 80% of his state\u2019s population of almost 20 million was at risk of contracting the virus.</p> <p>\u201cIt feels like we\u2019re on our own,\u201d De Blasio said on CNN. \u201cWe have seen next to nothing from the federal government at this point.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s response came at an evening press conference at the White House, during which he acknowledged \u201ca back-up\u201d in some states and reeled off numbers and lists of equipment he said had been ordered for the three worst-hit states, New York, Washington and California, and others.</p> <p>He also said the US government would be funding \u201c100%\u201d of the costs of national guard deployment to assist in the supply chain, said he had approved major disaster declarations for New York and Washington states and that the army corps of engineers would be available for the construction of field hospitals providing thousands of new beds.</p> <p>\u201cWhatever the states can get, they should be getting,\u201d the president said.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s sort of a back-up for the states, and some of the states are doing really well and some don\u2019t do as well. The ones that don\u2019t do as well need more help. But these are three states that really do need help because they are hit really hard.\u201d</p> <p>Cuomo had urged the president to invoke the powers of the Defense Production Act for the<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/22/politics/andrew-cuomo-coronavirus-federal-government/index.html\"> government to assume the acquisition and distribution of medical supplies</a> and prevent states having to compete with each other for essential equipment. He said masks that would usually cost 85 cents were costing his state, where more than 15,000 have the virus and 117 have died, about $7 apiece.</p> <p>But Trump insisted that private companies stepping up to manufacture much-needed equipment was the way to go. \u201cDoing it the way we\u2019re doing it is much better,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have the threat of doing it if we need it but we have millions of masks being done, ventilators, respirators, we have a lot of good things happening right now.</p> <p>\u201cCompanies are calling us, General Motors spoke to us about doing ventilators. If I call companies and say, \u2018you build us ventilators,\u2019 they don\u2019t even know what a ventilator is.\u201d</p> <p>Trump also suggested that hospitals could sterilize face masks so they could be reused.</p> <h2>Dems block rescue bill over lack of worker aid</h2> <p>Meanwhile, in the US Senate, Democrats blocked legislation that would have pumped $1tn into the US economy, claiming the Republican-crafted bill favored corporate interests over hospitals, healthcare workers, cities and states. Earlier, the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, was touting the stimulus that would have put $3,000 into the hands of most American families.</p> <p>The failure forces the two parties back to the negotiating table on Monday. Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, said Democrats might craft their own legislation proposals. \u201cWe\u2019re going to work with everybody to see if we can get something done,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe have to help the American worker.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/coronavirus-rand-paul-senator-tests-positive-covid-19\">Rand Paul becomes first senator to test positive for Covid-19</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A number of US senators were weighing up a decision to self-quarantine after news emerged that the Kentucky Republican <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/22/coronavirus-rand-paul-senator-tests-positive-covid-19\">Rand Paul had tested positive</a> for Covid-19.

Those travelling to their permanent place of residence would also be exempt from the measure. </p> <p>But once enforced anyone out on the streets would have to have their passports or identity cards with them at all times, the centre right leader said insisting that the full force of the law would be imposed on those who violated the restriction. Fines of 150 euro will be given in the case of infractions. </p> <p>Although Greece has managed to contain the spread of Covid-19 infections, numbers are going up and privately officials say they expect a big leap in the coming days. On Sunday, health authorities announced that in the past 24 hours there had been 94 new cases of people testing positive for the virus with a total of 624 confirmed coronavirus cases countrywide. To date, 15 people have died from the disease (with the exception of three, all men). Altogether 124 have been hospitalised with 34 requiring intensive care - double the figure over that released yesterday. Most of those who have contracted the virus are in Athens. The average age of those hospitalised is 64. <br><br>Greece was among the first EU member states to announce draconian measures to stem the virus, starting with the closure of schools on March 10, followed by the shutting of nightclubs, gyms, cinemas and theatres two days later and cafes, restaurants, bars and shopping malls on March 13. All retail shops were ordered closed on March 18. In his address, Mitsotakis thanked the vast majority of Greeks for upholding the restrictions, chastising the \u201cfrivolous few [who] undermine the safety of most.\u201d </p> <p>Greeks could be seen in droves converging on beaches on Saturday to enjoy the warm weather.

That, and the country\u2019s proximity to Italy, played a central role in the government taking a tough stance from the outset announcing measures that included the closure of schools early on. </p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-03-22T15:36:41.642Z\">at 3.36pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5e7777128f08dcc95cc21020\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/akhtar-mohammad-makoii\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-03-22T14:38:01.492Z\">2.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Afghanistan announces first coronavirus death</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Afghanistan has announced its first Coronavirus death.

Speaking on the occasion of the New Year and Eid al-Mab\u2019ath, the 80-year-old said \u201cyou Americans are accused of engineering coronavirus\u201d, adding: \u201cI do not know how true this claim is, but as long as the accusation stands, which sensible person would trust you to accept your offer of help.</p> <p>\u201cPossibly your (offered) medicine is a way to spread the virus more,\u201d he said. \u201cOr if you send therapists and doctors, maybe so they want to see the effect of the poison in Iranian society, so they can complete their information. It is said that part of the virus was produced against the Iranian people.\u201d</p> <p>His tone contradicted that of the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, who had the day before sent a heartfelt plea to the American public to set aside their differences with Iran and work together to fight the virus, including by the US suspending economic sanctions on Iran.</p> <p>The supreme leader was immediately challenged by Iranian reformist politicians such as Mahmoud Sadeghi to produce evidence to back his claim.</p> <p>Khamenei\u2019s controversial belief in an American biological conspiracy came as the Iranian health ministry said the new infections in Iran in the past 24 hours had reached 1,865, with a further 129 deaths. The official figures show the number of deaths by day stabilising.</p> <p>The total number of infected people had reached 21,638. The health ministry spokesman said 7,913 people had recovered.</p> <p>The official figures have been widely challenged on the basis that the recording of the number of deaths includes only those who died after being tested for the disease. The World Health Organization has said the figure may be only a fifth of the true number who have died. The official death toll shows no obvious pattern since for the last three days it has risen only from 220 to 240, yet the infections are rising.</p> <p>Iran also continued to send out contradictory messages about whether it could overcome the virus without sanctions being lifted. The letter from the president underlined the need for US sanctions being lifted. Khamenei has insisted the country can survive independently.</p> <p>The US state department hit back at claims it was preventing medicines reaching Iran, saying: \u201cDear Iranians, as your government will not tell you the truth, we say: on March 2, Iran, which instead of acting like any normal government around the world, refuses to make your economic system transparent. The reason the regime is hiding its economy is because it is corrupt.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\"></p> <p>In Tehran province the deputy mayor, Hamid Reza Goudarzi, after weeks of controversy has announced that all shops but essential food shops and pharmacies must close, and those that refuse to abide by the instructions will be punished.</p> <p>The International Monetary Fund has still not responded to an Iranian request for a $5bn loan to help fight the virus.</p> <p>Qom News, an agency covering Qom, one of the centres of the disease, reported on Sunday: \u201cIn every house black cloth hangs from the walls of houses and the sound of crying in mourning houses resounds.
