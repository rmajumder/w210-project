  "<p>News that Matt Hancock, the health secretary, used Friday morning to announce a \u201c<a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/video/matt-hancock-lays-six-point-battle-plan-conquer-coronavirus-2153878/\">six-point battle plan</a>\u201d stirs memories of yore \u2013 Thursday afternoon \u2013 when the supply prime minister, Dominic Raab, announced his \u201c<a href=\"https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/dominic-raab-s-five-tests-for-easing-the-lockdown\">five tests</a>\u201d. Indeed, those five tests themselves felt like the twitch of a phantom limb, redolent of the time Hancock announced his \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/matt-hancock-sets-target-of-100000-coronavirus-tests-a-day\">five pillars</a>\u201d. Five pillars \u2013 like Islam, or the lost Temple of Cybele in Rome, or a Floridian McMansion where the contractor went bust halfway through completing the portico.</p> <p>You don\u2019t hear a whole lot about Matt\u2019s five pillars these days, though the announcement of them did the job at the time. On Wednesday, Hancock drew attention away from the desperate shortage of PPE in care homes by re-announcing an NHS-style badge for those who work in care. Alas, in a development best described as ironicidal, the care badge website then swiftly ran into difficulties, leaving visitors greeted with the news that there was now a shortage of care badges. Until production is \u201cramped up\u201d, it\u2019s hard not to conclude that the chief success of the care badge was to form a psychic shield around the health secretary. It will, however, take more than a badge if he doesn\u2019t hit his 100,000 tests a day target for the end of April, having already <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/testing-for-coronavirus-covid-19-will-increase-to-25-000-a-day\">missed the 25,000-a-day</a> target for the middle of the month.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/17/coronavirus-crisis-britain-young-people-future-bill\">When the coronavirus crisis is over, it should be payback time for the young | Polly Toynbee</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Can you recall if the 100,000 tests was ever technically a pillar? It all feels beyond living memory. If you told me he had announced them sometime in the mid-Cretaceous period, staring soulfully into the camera even as a T-Rex pursued him, I\u2019d believe you. In fact, it was a fortnight ago.</p> <p>Still, don\u2019t take the above as an unfavourable review of the specific energy Hancock brings to the daily Downing Street press conferences. I personally respect the way he treats each one like the James Blunt <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oofSnsGkops\">video for You\u2019re Beautiful</a>, delivering his painful truths right down the barrel. Just leaves it all on the stage. If you honestly can\u2019t hear another word of one of these things, I\u2019d recommend watching them with the sound down and Blunt whacked up to 11 \u2013 the pandemic equivalent of getting your test match footage from Sky but the commentary off the radio.</p> <p>Naturally, this type of artiste always divides the critics. Even so it was very disappointing recently to learn that one No 10 official had told the Sunday Times\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/inside-no-10-everyone-is-at-war-over-coronavirus-56rwtmf9q\">Tim Shipman</a>: \u201cThere is not much love for Matt Handjob here.\u201d Known to receive even less favourable notices from his officials is Raab, who gives the 5pm press conference with the air of a man who strongly suspects there\u2019s a chalk penis drawn on his back, but is just going to butch it out by facing forward till the bell goes.</p> <p>Talking of butching it out, the good news is that the government is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/apr/15/eu-and-uk-government-to-resume-post-brexit-talks-next-week\">going to refuse to extend</a> the Brexit transition period beyond the end of this year, even if the EU requests a delay, and against the <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52304821\">urging of the International Monetary Fund</a>. I know the ultra-Brexiteers enjoy a good war metaphor, so let\u2019s just say that this out-of-the-pandemic-into-the-no-deal move threatens to give our nation a strong <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Indianapolis_(CA-35)\">USS Indianapolis </a>feel to it. By way of background, the Indianapolis was torpedoed and sunk by the Japanese in 1945, in one of the worst naval attacks of the second world war. Those sailors who survived were left bobbing in the Pacific, where, over the next few days, they were subject to the <a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/the-worst-shark-attack-in-history-25715092/\">worst recorded shark attack</a> in history.</p> <p>Anyway, thus things rumble on while the prime minister remains off games. Boris Johnson is at Chequers, where his spokesman clarifies he is \u201cnot doing government work\u201d. A slightly strange styling, which makes some people assume Johnson is finishing his late-delivered Shakespeare book. I\u2019m sure nothing is further from the truth \u2013 not even Johnson himself, who has rarely been in the same hemisphere as the truth for his entire career.</p> <p>But there is clearly some trade-off as to how his stand-ins should handle this particular chit from matron. On the one hand, they keep stressing absolutely everything is proceeding in accordance with a plan laid out by the prime minister before he fell ill. On the other, they want to avoid going too far on that front, or risk casting the UK as the driverless car of governance, a largely automated enterprise where the role of prime minister is essentially meaningless. A bit like that of regimental goat, or England football captain. (The Italians, of course, just give the armband to the oldest guy on the pitch. Then again, the past couple of months have arguably shown that we don\u2019t care to learn anything much from the Italians.) </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/17/coronavirus-live-news-trump-says-29-states-could-reopen-relatively-soon-as-global-deaths-near-145000\">Coronavirus live news: China denies cover-up as Wuhan death toll revised up by 50%</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Perhaps the best thing that can be said at the moment is that at least we\u2019re not the United States.

Pressed repeatedly on Thursday to tell his supporters who are flouting the lockdown to stay at home, Trump said: \u201cThey seem to be protesters that like me and respect my opinion.\u201d So, unfortunately, he couldn\u2019t bring himself to.</p> <p>Having actively contributed to the loss of lives, Trump is going to have to get very creative in citing any that he\u2019s saved. That said, last month was the <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-school-shooting-stats-gun-laws-hillary-clinton-coronavirus-a9465406.html\">first March without</a> a school shooting since 2002, so maybe he could credit himself with the new approach to the US school shootings problem currently being trialled. Which is to say: no schools. All that time parent activists have spent trying to limit guns, it turned out that the smart way to do it was just to shut schools. Really makes you think. Do expect to see the National Rifle Association unveil a new slogan in the coming months: Guns don\u2019t kill people; schools do.</p> <p>\u2022 Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 27 April 2020.

Other states, meanwhile, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/article/2020-campaign-primary-calendar-coronavirus.html\">postponed</a> their primaries. At times, Evers was <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/04/02/tony-evers-wisconsin-democrats-primary-election-161423\">criticized</a> by other Democrats for his approach to delaying the election. Just before the primary, he issued an executive order postponing in-person voting. But that was overturned by the state\u2019s supreme court, meaning voters would gather in large groups to vote against the warnings of health experts. However, Democrats came out of the election with a victory in the state\u2019s supreme court election where the liberal candidate beat a conservative incumbent endorsed by Trump.</p>",

Only once these issues have been addressed should we consider performing elective surgery that cannot be safely deferred until the pandemic is over. </p> \n  <p>\u201cAn additional measure that will ensure the safety of healthcare workers and patients would see a defined perioperative quarantine period of 14 days prior to surgery. </p> \n  <p>\u201cThe public have made a concerted effort to socially isolate and reduce transmission of Covid-19 in our community and in our healthcare system. We would hope that patients planning to undergo elective surgery would continue to protect themselves, their families and the healthcare workers looking after them with a period of quarantine before their surgery.\u201d<br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-17T03:50:01.208Z\">at 4.50am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9924b38f0895d83068fa4b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-17T03:40:16.403Z\">4.40am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>NBN Co is now publishing weekly updates on how the network is handling the additional load of so many people working and studying at home, before going to another room to stream content until the screaming in our minds can\u2019t be heard (we are all Clarice now).<br></p> \n  <p><a href=\"https://www.nbnco.com.au/campaigns/covid-19\">You\u2019ll find those updates, here</a>.<br></p> \n  <li> On the main NBN wholesale service: </li> \n  <ul> \n   <li> Weekly upload throughput peak of 1.06 Terabits per second (Tbps) recorded on Friday 10 April during the Evening Busy Hours.</li> \n   <li> Weekly download throughput peak of 13.8Tbps recorded on Wednesday 8 April during the Evening Busy Hours.</li> \n   <li> Download throughput peak of 11.6Tbps on 8 April recorded during the daytime business hours surpassed pre-Covid-19 baseline evening peak for the first time.</li> \n  </ul> \n  <li> Ninety-nine per cent of new NBN retail orders in the past week based on wholesale speed tier plans of 25Mbps or faster.</li> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-17T03:45:39.982Z\">at 4.45am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9924798f0895d83068fa4a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-17T03:37:53.957Z\">4.37am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The deputy chief medical officer, Prof <strong>Paul Kelly</strong>, will give today\u2019s national update on the Covid situation.</p> \n  <p>That will happen at 3.15.<br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-17T03:43:45.100Z\">at 4.43am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e9923f28f0895d83068fa48\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-17T03:36:57.030Z\">4.36am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>The Loki Foundation, which describes itself as Australia\u2019s first privacy tech not for profit, has written <a href=\"https://loki.foundation/contact-tracing-in-australia-and-abroad/\">an open letter on the issue of the tracing app</a> the government wants people to download (and may, depending on download rates, make mandatory \u2013 something <strong>Scott Morrison</strong> did not rule out today, saying only it was \u201cnot my preference\u201d).</p> \n  <p>The foundation doesn\u2019t have a problem with the model Apple and Google are working on.<br></p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2020-04-17T03:43:26.593Z\">at 4.43am BST</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-5e991d618f08cf571cdb2a03\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2020-04-17T03:08:09.435Z\">4.08am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Public and private hospitals in the NT and SA will now be able to work together, under a new interim authorisation granted by the consumer watchdog this afternoon:<br></p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>Private hospitals and health agencies in the Northern Territory and South Australia respectively will be able to cooperate in responding to the Covid-19 pandemic, following separate interim authorisations granted by the ACCC today.</p> \n   <p>Today\u2019s interim authorisations granted to each of the Northern Territory and the state of South Australia follow similar authorisations granted to Victoria and Queensland earlier this month.</p> \n   <p>State and territory governments are seeking to increase the capacity of their health systems during the pandemic by integrating the operations of public and private hospitals.

  "<p>Former vice-president Joe Biden\u2019s presidential campaign has had to adapt to both its new status as the Democratic party\u2019s presumptive nominee and as a candidate who can\u2019t leave his home to campaign due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p> \n<p>That means taking the fight to unseat Donald Trump from the White House in November almost entirely online.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/15/bernie-sanders-joe-biden-irresponsible-not-support\">Sanders warns his loyalists it would be \u2018irresponsible\u2019 not to support Biden</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Instead of shaking hands in swing states or giving speeches in arenas, Biden\u2019s most visible moments in recent weeks have been in front of a camera broadcasting from his basement. </p> \n<p>But the Biden campaign has begun embracing the new reality. He has started a regular podcast where he\u2019s interviewed political figures. Virtually every day his campaign airs a live stream of him taking questions or having a discussion with an elected official.</p> \n<p>Ron Klain, a longtime aide to Biden, critiqued Donald Trump\u2019s response to the coronavirus in a roughly <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-M7SH_xw_NY\">five-minute </a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-M7SH_xw_NY\">You</a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-M7SH_xw_NY\">Tube video</a>. Biden over the various channels has focused on how he would approach the pandemic differently and what he sees as Trump\u2019s failures.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think his positioning on \u2018if I were president, this is what I would be doing\u2019 is a smart place to be,\u201d said veteran Democratic strategist Michael Halle, who recently served as a top adviser to the former South Bend mayor Pete Buttigieg\u2019s presidential campaign.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think people are looking for an alternative right now and also answers for \u2018how do we come out of this and how do we prevent this in the future?\u2019 And you see [the Biden campaign] starting to angle toward that and providing a longer-term vision which I don\u2019t think you\u2019re ever going to get from Trump.\u201d</p> \n<p>Biden has upped the frequency of his appearances on television, appearing on major cable networks and local stations almost daily over the past two weeks. On Facebook, the Biden campaign more than doubled the amount of money spent on ads in the last week compared with the Trump campaign. Trump, though, has still spent more overall on that platform.</p> \n<p>Biden campaign fundraisers are also now virtual, changing the logistics of organizing them and who can appear as a headliner, including former rivals. The California senator Kamala Harris was the surprise guest at his second virtual fundraiser in April.</p> \n<p>\u201cIn some respects it does make the barriers to pulling off these things much smaller,\u201d Democratic strategist Eli Kaplan said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"ec64ff6d-a5cb-4878-828d-bd6da8ce367e\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4yCY232AZ_8?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>In the next few weeks the Biden campaign\u2019s fundraising schedule, according to a list obtained by the Guardian, includes a Women for Biden event headlined by his wife Dr Jill Biden and daughter Ashley Biden, a virtual fireside chat with the candidate, and another fundraiser in late April featuring celebrities Kristin Chenoweth, Melissa Etheridge, Billie Jean King and Billy Porter.</p> \n<p>The campaign is also planning to set up a digital \u201cropeline\u201d where Biden can interact with voters.</p> \n<p>But even with all those changes, Biden is still having difficulty competing with the New York governor, Andrew Cuomo, and Trump for attention during the coronavirus pandemic. Cuomo\u2019s daily press conferences usually air live on all the major cable networks and the coronavirus taskforce briefing helmed by Trump has become a chance for reporters to ask the president questions in front of a televised audience. </p> \n<p>What\u2019s still unclear is how the coronavirus and the resulting state stay-at-home orders will affect Biden\u2019s field organizing as November\u2019s election heaves into view. The campaign is looking into coordinating virtual house parties as well.</p> \n<p>Usually, when a presidential candidate has vanquished all other rivals in their party he or she begins building a robust field program and conducts door-knocking to win over general election voters. But the pandemic means that part of campaigning is on hold and clouded with uncertainty.</p> \n<p>Instead of pounding pavements, campaign workers will have to leverage social media platforms to build that organization.</p> \n<p>The Biden campaign utilized phone banking, texting to voters, and its support on social media in winning the set of Super Tuesday states in March.</p> \n<p>\u201cOur team has leveraged their expertise and talent to create powerful digital products that have harnessed millions of views, and as we continue our virtual campaign we will continue exploring creative and innovative formats while getting ready to grow,\u201d a Biden spokesman said.</p>",

  "<p>Donald Trump and his coronavirus taskforce have unveiled a set of federal guidelines for reopening the economy, which comprise three phases<strong> </strong>but ultimately defer to governors on when and how to return their states to normal.</p> \n<p>The first phase allows for gradually returning to work while also minimizing non-essential travel. The second phase allows for gatherings of 50 people and non-essential travel. The third allows for schools and organized youth activities to open up as well as large venues to operate under \u201cphysical distancing protocols\u201d. The third phase also allows bars to reopen but with \u201cdiminished standing room occupancy\u201d when possible.</p> \n<p>The guidelines were unveiled at the president\u2019s daily coronavirus briefing on Thursday.</p> \n<p>Earlier in the day, Trump held a conference call with the country\u2019s governors to preview the guidelines. Trump said it was essentially up to them to lift their stay-at-home orders but encouraged them to do so if they saw no apparent health risk, a move that contradicted his previous claim of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/trump-us-coronavirus-briefing-latest-media\">total authority</a>\u201d to decide if and when a state should reopen. Likewise the new guidelines largely defer to governors to decide when to move to each phase. </p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/openingamerica/\">guidelines</a> represent a dramatic shift from the strict stay-at-home orders currently in place in many states.

In laying out the first phase of the guidelines, Dr Deborah Birx, the coronavirus taskforce response coordinator, explained that some strict orders would have to stay in place.</p> \n<p>\u201cIf the schools are closed, they should continue to be closed,\u201d Birx said. \u201cGyms could open if they adhere to strict physical distancing.\u201d</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> \n <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"interactives/2020/coronavirus-us-new/map\" data-atom-type=\"interactive\"> \n  <div>\n   default\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>Dr Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the guidelines did not mark an immediate end to governors\u2019 coronavirus pandemic responses.</p> \n<p>A \u201clight switch on and off is the exact opposite of what you see here\u201d, Fauci said. \u201cYou don\u2019t get to phase one until you get through the gating.\u201d</p> \n<p>Trump is optimistic that many states are ready to advance through the guidelines.</p> \n<p>\u201cI think 29 states are in that ballgame,\u201d Trump said. \u201cNot for opening, but I think they\u2019ll be able to open relatively soon. I think the remainder are just getting better. Look, New York, New Jersey are having very tough times and they\u2019ll be there. They\u2019ll be there at some point. But they\u2019re not going to be one of the earlier states. They\u2019ll be later, obviously.\u201d</p> \n<p>The White House sought support from business leaders and lawmakers ahead of unveiling its new guidelines, and Trump spoke earlier on Thursday with congressional lawmakers in both parties. The White House also announced a set of senators who would participate on the president\u2019s \u201cTask Force to Reopen America\u201d.</p> \n<p>But governors have indicated that the guidelines may only be a factor in what states decide to do next. A few governors even extended their stay-at-home orders and signed new executive orders on Thursday in response to the pandemic.</p> \n<p>The governors of Michigan, Illinois, Ohio, Kentucky, Wisconsin, Indiana, and Minnesota announced a new partnership for coordinating reopening their states\u2019 respective economies. Governors along both coasts have already unveiled similar alliances.</p> \n<p>But other governors praised the president\u2019s new directions.</p> \n<p>\u201cI appreciate President Trump\u2019s guidelines for reopening pieces of the economy that have been closed temporarily,\u201d the Nebraska governor, Pete Ricketts, said. \u201cIt is critical that we get people back to work safely and continue to slow the spread of the virus as the country opens up.\u201d</p>",
  "<p>It was only about an hour into Sophia\u2019s morning shift at the Tyson chicken plant in Springdale, Arkansas, when the air turned lethal. As the shrink-wrapped chicken parts rolled off the line at a relentless pace, Sophia\u2019s job was to load them into boxes, for which she earned $10 an hour. It was grinding, monotonous work, and the room where she worked was kept so cold that it felt like standing in a refrigerator for eight hours straight.</p> <p>On this day in June 2011, Sophia felt a hot, itchy sensation as the skin on her face started to burn. Then she started to feel as if a balloon had blown up inside her lungs. In a room at the plant where antibacterial chemicals were stored, a terrible blunder had been made. A plant worker had mixed chlorine with an acid-based antimicrobial agent, creating chlorine gas, a poison so terrible that, after its use as a chemical weapon on the battlefields of the first world war, it was banned under the Geneva convention. Even small amounts can inflame the lungs, causing respiratory distress and death.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/may/22/us-food-industry-factory-workers-coronavirus-podcast\">'If one of us gets sick, we all get sick': the food workers on the coronavirus front line \u2013 podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As greenish-yellow fumes began to spread inside the plant, Sophia heard a man yelling<em>, \u201cVamonos, vamonos!\u201d</em> Panic set in among the workers, many of whom were struggling to breathe. The exit closest to Sophia\u2019s workstation was the same door through which the gas was entering. She pulled the top of her sweater up from under her rubber apron, stretching it over her nose. It was a futile gesture. As she waited for her frantic colleagues to get out of the door, all she could do was pray: \u201cGod save me, God save me.\u201d When, at last, she made it outside, she saw dozens of workers sprawled on the pavement.</p> <p>Springdale was ill-prepared for the scale of <a href=\"https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2011/jun/27/chlorine-leak-tyson-plant-hospitalizes-several/?latest\" title=\"\">the disaster</a>. The city had only four ambulances, so the fire department was scrambled to take injured workers to hospital. Sophia and others needing medical attention were eventually put on a city bus. Sophia was still struggling to breathe. She began vomiting and coughing up blood. Many of the 173 workers who were taken to hospital recovered quickly, but others had symptoms that became more serious. Three workers developed chronic asthma; Sophia (she did not want to use her real name out of fear of retaliation from Tyson, where she still works) was among them.</p> <p>It was one of the worst industrial accidents ever seen in Springdale, and the biggest to hit Tyson\u2019s Berry Street plant, where 600 workers attend production lines, in shifts, 18 hours a day, processing 140 chickens per minute. On most days, the stench of chicken manure hangs about the downtown complex, and a steady stream of trucks unloads crates of squawking chickens for slaughter, before their carcasses are stripped and washed with chemicals.</p> <p>The Berry Street plant is one of 123 operated across the US by Tyson Foods Inc. With sales of $42bn last year, Tyson is the largest processor of chicken in the world. Founded in Springdale in the 1930s, the business transformed a once quiet agricultural town of fewer than 3,000 people into a sprawling city of 81,000. As the largest private employer, Tyson dominates the local economy and has built a reputation as a beneficent corporate presence. It makes large donations to local nonprofits, including food banks and, through its chaplaincy programme \u2013 one is assigned to every Tyson processing plant \u2013 has many local priests and preachers on its payroll.</p> <p>However, allegations of a widespread effort to suppress wages has tarnished this charitable image. According to a <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2019-09-03/u-s-chicken-industry-accused-of-conspiring-to-keep-immigrant-wages-down\" title=\"\">lawsuit</a> filed in late 2019 against Tyson and 17 other poultry processors in the US, the wages paid to the hundreds of thousands of mostly immigrant workers were kept low through illegal means. Since 2009, the suit contends, executives from the 18 poultry companies held secret meetings in Florida, where they conspired to fix lower wages by sharing detailed information about hourly pay and benefits. Tyson declined to comment on the suit.</p> <p>Chicken processing is one of the lowest-paid and most hazardous industries in the US, <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-18-12\" title=\"\">according to a 2017 report</a> by the US Government Accountability Office, which revealed that workers suffer carpal tunnel syndrome at a rate seven times the national average. In 2013, the US Department of Labor\u2019s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) placed Tyson in the agency\u2019s severe violator enforcement program, which targets \u201crecalcitrant employers that endanger workers by committing willful, repeat, or failure-to-abate violation\u201d after a worker\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/news/newsreleases/region7/12172013\" title=\"\">hand was severed</a> by a conveyer belt. (Tyson said the proposed penalty was later withdrawn, when the OSHA was satisfied remedial action had been taken.) In 2016, after a worker\u2019s finger was severed at a Tyson processing plant in Center, Texas, OSHA inspectors found more than <a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/news/newsreleases/region6/08162016\" title=\"\">a dozen violations</a>, including inadequate safety guards on machines, carbon dioxide levels above exposure limits, and no protective equipment for workers handling chemicals. In March, a contractor cleaning machinery in a <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/alabama-carlos-lynn-decapitated-chicken-processing-plant-a9381426.html\" title=\"\">Tyson chicken plant in Alabama</a> was decapitated in an accident.</p> <p>After the 2011 accident, Tyson says it increased training for workers handling chemicals, and now stores chlorine and acid-based chemicals separately. However, in June 2019, five workers <a href=\"https://thecounter.org/tyson-chemical-spill-worker-injury-plant-inspection-privatization-slaughter-line-speed-usda/\" title=\"\">were hospitalised</a> after being sprayed with chemicals from a hose at the Springdale plant. In a written statement, Tyson blamed a contractor for the accident. \u201cA contractor left a hose without following proper rinsing or storage procedure and asked our team members to gather the hose for the contractor\u2019s use,\u201d the company said. One of the workers was reported to be in a critical condition for two days.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>Sophia was back at work soon after the chemical leak at the plant. She had no choice. She still felt weak and faint, but she received no sick pay during this time. In the days after the accident, she had a recurring nightmare in which she relived the terror of seeing a female worker falling to the floor during the rush to escape.</p> <p>While Sophia was recovering in hospital, she later told me, something changed in her. She had survived, and she wasn\u2019t going to leave another woman behind again. She would find a way to speak out about the low wages that left her and other families barely able to make ends meet. They feared seeking work elsewhere, in case their injuries would cost them their health insurance. \u201cI\u2019m stuck and I had no choice but to fight,\u201d she told me.</p> <p>Sophia was not alone. Alarmed that their employer was not taking their concerns seriously, a number of workers, led by a group of Latina women, began taking on Tyson foods directly in a bid to negotiate better working conditions, living wages and sick pay. Many of them work at the Berry Street plant. They were still negotiating when coronavirus reached the US, and food factory workers were suddenly trapped on the front line, helping to keep Americans fed.</p> <p>On 13 March, the first community-spread case of Covid-19 was reported in Arkansas. Not long after, Tyson told its salaried employees at corporate headquarters to work from home. Schools were soon closed in Springdale, but its processing plants kept operating, including Berry Street. Americans were stocking up with food, preparing for weeks of isolation, and demand was high. The US vice-president, Mike Pence, told food workers they were part of the \u201ccritical infrastructure\u201d and must \u201cshow up and do their job\u201d. As fear grew among meat processing workers that the plants may be unsafe, Tyson offered a bonus of $500 if people turn up for three months without missing a shift.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"35482f8abe237a136d2752533536c0710a951c33\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/35482f8abe237a136d2752533536c0710a951c33/0_0_3600_2384/1000.jpg\" alt=\"US vice president Mike Pence (second from left) visiting a Tyson Foods plant in Goodlettsville, Tennessee last year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US vice president Mike Pence (second from left) visiting a Tyson Foods plant in Goodlettsville, Tennessee last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: George Walker IV/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sophia kept going to work every day, even though she was vulnerable to infection: her asthma, caused by the chlorine gas accident, increases the risk to her health if exposed to Covid-19. \u201cI am afraid. My lungs are not healthy,\u201d she told me last month. She had moved to the evisceration lines, cutting the tails off chicken carcasses, then removing any guts or feathers left, because the cold air in the packing room made her cough. \u201cI don\u2019t know where to be, where I can feel safe,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Sophia said she was afraid the virus would spread quickly through the crowded plant. But like other workers on the chicken processing lines, she had to keep working. If she didn\u2019t show up at the Berry Street plant, she wouldn\u2019t get paid. She also knew the cost of taking on the most powerful company in town: she had spent much of the last decade battling Tyson over workers\u2019 rights, and she had learned that even the smallest concession involved a mighty struggle.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>After the 2011 chlorine gas disaster, Tyson faced few financial consequences. Investigators with OSHA arrived on the scene just over 24 hours after the accident, and following a five-month investigation, judged that the company had been negligent. Tyson had failed to \u201censure that the employees had effective hazard communications training\u201d, and \u201cnot all employees understood the labelling system in the facility\u201d, according to the inspection report (which I obtained through a freedom of information <a href=\"https://www.foia.gov/how-to.html\" title=\"\">request</a>). Although the failure was categorised as \u201cserious\u201d, the fine came to only $7,000. Yet during a year in which Tyson posted profits of $733m, the company contested that minimal fine, and through an informal settlement with the federal agency in 2012, paid only $2,500 \u2013 or $14 for each of the 173 workers whose injuries were serious enough for them to be hospitalised. </p> <p>The workers at the Berry Street plant, some of whom were still dealing with the effects of the chemical gas leak, were unimpressed. Many of them attended a community health clinic a few blocks from the plant, where a member of staff, Magaly Licolli, a young Mexican immigrant, heard their stories. \u201cThese stories changed me for life,\u201d Licolli said. She spent the next five years working with the poultry workers in town to try to improve their conditions.</p> <p>In February 2016, Licolli stood outside Tyson\u2019s headquarters alongside dozens of workers, many of whom had been injured in the 2011 chlorine gas incident. Licolli, by then director at NW Arkansas Workers Justice Center, was announcing the release of <a href=\"https://www.uusc.org/press/new-arkansas-poultry-industry-report/\" title=\"\">a damning report</a> based on interviews with 500 poultry workers throughout the state \u2013 a third of whom worked for Tyson \u2013 who described poorly paid, physically gruelling work. Nine out of 10 of them said they received no sick pay, and nearly two-thirds said they had no option but to work while sick. Female workers said male supervisors put restrictions on their bathroom breaks, which meant they sometimes wet themselves on the production line.</p> <p>The report offered a rare window into workers\u2019 experiences in one of the state\u2019s largest industries, and a chance for a largely immigrant workforce in Springdale to speak out against an unequal system that netted billions for Tyson, while many workers lived below the poverty line. \u201cWe were working within a very hostile culture in Arkansas,\u201d Licolli recalled. \u201cTalking about labour in the south was already a challenge because of its history of slavery, and the labour laws still, in many ways, reflect that kind of thinking.\u201d</p> <p>That hostile culture became even harsher after Trump\u2019s landslide victory in Arkansas in the 2016 election. The state\u2019s two Republican senators, Tom Cotton and John Boozman, frequently echoed the president\u2019s anti-immigrant rhetoric. Cotton sponsored a bill to cut legal immigration by half in a decade, while Boozman pushed for legislation to give Trump billions for his border wall. Both had received significant campaign contributions from Tyson, although the company had played an important part in boosting immigration, having <a href=\"https://migration.ucdavis.edu/rmn/more.php?id=645\" title=\"\">sent buses</a> to bring temporary workers from Mexico and put them to work in its processing plants and hatcheries.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"long read email signup\">  <iframe src=\"https://www.theguardian.com/email/form/plaintone/the-long-read\" height=\"52px\" data-form-title=\"Sign up for The Long Read email\u201d data-form-description=\u201cGet the Guardian's award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning\u201d scrolling=\"no\" seamless frameborder=\"0\" class=\"iframed--overflow-hidden email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe js-email-sub__iframe--article\" data-form-success-desc=\"Thanks for signing up\"></iframe> <figcaption>Get the Guardian\u2019s award-winning long reads sent direct to you every Saturday morning</figcaption> </figure>  <p>The day after the report came out, the workers\u2019 campaign group pressed Tyson for a response. Licolli and workers from Berry Street gathered to continue their protest outside a Holiday Inn in Springdale, where Tyson\u2019s annual shareholder meeting was underway. Later that day, Licolli went to Tyson\u2019s corporate headquarters, accompanied by a local minister and Minor Sinclair, a director of US domestic programmes for Oxfam. Licolli was the only Latina at the table before a dozen or so executives, all but one of whom were men. She recalled the tension around the table. \u201cThey were really mad that we were taking these actions,\u201d she said. \u201cI felt like they were lecturing us.\u201d</p> <p>Executives pointed out the various measures and processes in place for health and safety, and rejected the findings of the report, which they felt did not reflect conditions at Tyson. All the same, as Licolli left Tyson\u2019s HQ, she felt proud that, for the first time, plant workers had taken Tyson to task in its hometown. \u201cI felt like it was the beginning of something different,\u201d she said</p> <p>A few months later, on 11 May 2016, Oxfam released its own report, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/12/poultry-workers-wear-diapers-work-bathroom-breaks\" title=\"\">which claimed</a> that Tyson chicken processors were so afraid of being fired if they failed to hit their quota on the production line that they dared not take bathroom breaks. Workers had come up with a job-saving innovation \u2013 wearing adult diapers, urinating and even defecating as they worked the line, rather than fall behind.</p> <p>The bathroom-breaks scandal made the news across the US, and internationally. A response on Tyson\u2019s website expressed concern about \u201cthese anonymous claims\u201d in the Oxfam report, saying that \u201cwhile we currently have no evidence they\u2019re true\u201d, they would check that company policy on breaks was being followed.</p> <p>For Licolli, the Oxfam report was a great leap forward. \u201cIt felt like a relief for them to have our back,\u201d she recalls. \u201cWe were stronger in that moment than ever before.\u201d The same day, in coordination with Oxfam, Licolli delivered 150,000 signatures wrapped in plastic on Styrofoam trays, like chicken breasts, to Tyson\u2019s headquarters. In response, Tyson issued a press release that struck an accommodating tone: \u201cWe\u2019ve told them that while we believe we\u2019re a caring, responsible company, we\u2019re always willing to consider ways we can do better.\u201d</p> <p>Over the following months, falling food prices brought a slump in profits. Tyson replaced its CEO, and in April 2017, under new leadership, made some changes to working conditions, in consultation with Oxfam. But when Licolli read Tyson\u2019s statement on the new commitments, her heart sank. There were pledges to improve safety and rates of pay, but to Licolli, it was all very vague. \u201cThere was nothing explicit,\u201d she told me. \u201cNo \u2018we are going to do this by this time\u2019 \u2026 it was just empty. Workers would have no oversight or say in anything.\u201d Moreover, there was no mention of bathroom breaks.</p> <p>While Oxfam <a href=\"https://politicsofpoverty.oxfamamerica.org/a-big-win-for-poultry-workers/\" title=\"\">hailed the agreement</a> as a \u201cbig win\u201d on worker rights, Licolli felt betrayed. The charity had relied heavily for its research on her connections with poultry workers in town, but Licolli felt that at a certain point, she and the workers\u2019 delegates had been left out of the discussion. \u201cIt was just like Tyson and Oxfam getting together and shaking hands and saying: \u2018Good for you, good for me, let\u2019s say you are a good company,\u2019\u201d Licolli told me. She reluctantly agreed to Oxfam\u2019s request to issue a statement. \u201cI do think the company wants to change, but we\u2019re also very cautious,\u201d she <a href=\"https://firstperson.oxfamamerica.org/2017/04/the-new-agreement-for-poultry-workers-is-not-the-end-its-just-the-beginning/\" title=\"\">wrote</a>.</p> <p>When we approached Oxfam for comment, the charity said in a statement: \u201cSince the beginning of Oxfam\u2019s poultry campaign in 2015, we have focused on elevating the voices of poultry workers and advocating for worker rights and safe working conditions for front-line processing workers \u2026 In non-union plants [including Berry Street], Oxfam has urged, and continues to do so, that Tyson includes workers in review and monitoring of its commitments to a better workplace.\u201d</p> <p>But Licolli\u2019s caution turned out to be prescient. The workers were soon fighting a dangerous new threat to their health.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>After the slowdown of 2017, Tyson and the rest of the poultry industry wasted no time trying to turbo-charge chicken production. That meant resuming an old battle over production line speeds. In the last half century, poultry processors have increased line speeds from less than 100 birds per minute to 140 \u2013 the legal maximum established by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). Even at that rate, according to the US Government Accountability Office, workers <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/assets/690/688294.pdf\" title=\"\">risked injury and pain</a>, but chicken factories were <a href=\"https://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/wcm/connect/7734f5cf-05d9-4f89-a7eb-6d85037ad2a7/17-05-Petition-National-Chicken-Council-09012017.pdf?MOD=AJPERES\" title=\"\">lobbying aggressively</a> to get slaughter and evisceration lines moving faster.</p> <p>In late December 2017, Licolli travelled to Washington DC with injured workers, including Sophia, to challenge the line-speed proposals, and met with officials at the USDA. For Sophia, it was a revelation. \u201cI had a voice for the first time,\u201d she recalls. Working with Licolli she had found friendship and the courage to tell her story. The following month, in a surprise move, the Food Safety and Inspection Service at the USDA accepted their arguments and those of other workers\u2019 right groups, and <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2018/01/31/581956147/usda-denies-poultry-industrys-request-to-speed-up-the-slaughter-line\" title=\"\">turned down</a> the request to speed up chicken processing lines.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f324492054b0fd7ccb208f1fd1eb266a3d4ce19d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f324492054b0fd7ccb208f1fd1eb266a3d4ce19d/0_196_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Tyson Poultry truck at a processing plant in Texas in 2004.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Tyson Poultry truck at a processing plant in Texas in 2004.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mario Villafuerte/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But the next battle followed quickly. The meat and poultry industry had begun using a new weapon against bacteria in greater volumes. Peracetic acid \u2013 an antimicrobial developed for sterilising medical equipment \u2013 was found, if sprayed on carcasses, to reliably kill bacteria without leaving residue, which meant the whole process could be sped up. But, while safe for consumers, research has shown that it may carry health risks for workers. Long exposure has been shown to cause eye, skin and nose <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/occmed/article-abstract/69/4/294/5420724\" title=\"\">irritations</a> to medical workers, as well as <a href=\"https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/joh/49/2/49_2_155/_article/-char/ja/\" title=\"\">asthma</a>.</p> <p>In 2017, <a href=\"https://www.tysonfoods.com/news/viewpoints/antibiotic-use\" title=\"\">Tyson</a> announced plans to stop feeding human antibiotics to chickens, and began relying more heavily on antimicrobials. Jenny Leigh Houlroyd, a certified industrial hygienist and a senior research scientist at Georgia Tech, has been studying the use of peracetic acid in the poultry industry for years, and worries that a disaster may be slowly unfolding inside the lungs of workers. In 2018 she led a team of researchers in a pilot study of peracetic acid at four chicken plants in Georgia. During her time in the plants, workers told her about eye irritation, sore throats, headaches and sinus infections. The use of peracetic acid has been approved by the USDA and there is still no legal limit on exposure levels. With 250,000 poultry workers in the US exposed to peracetic acid, Houlroyd adds: \u201cThe industry needs to be listening to their workers. In the absence of definitive data, that is where you have to go. You have to listen to workers.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>On a warm Tuesday evening in October 2019, not far from the Berry Street plant, Sophia was among two dozen or so women rearranging folding chairs into a semi-circle inside a one-room church on a Springfield strip mall. Like Sophia, the women were Latina immigrants, all of whom have worked low-wage jobs in the city\u2019s chicken plants.</p> <p>\u201cNothing has changed,\u201d Sophia said. \u201cOxfam sold us out.\u201d Her voice, once strong and clear, was thin and soft, barely above a whisper, and punctuated by fits of coughing.</p> <p>The women had begun meeting quietly together for some time. The Oxfam agreement had created a major rift within what, at the time, was a growing movement among poultry workers. With little change in their daily working conditions, these women felt betrayed. They decided they wouldn\u2019t rely on outsiders to negotiate for them any more.</p> <p>The previous year, Licolli, along with Sophia and other workers, had made two visits down to Immokalee, Florida, known as the nation\u2019s tomato capital, where a worker-led movement <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/25/business/in-florida-tomato-fields-a-penny-buys-progress.html?hpw&amp;rref=us#slideshow/100000002843921/100000002843938\" title=\"\">had transformed</a> the conditions and wages for field workers, mostly poor immigrants from Latin America. The trip had been transformative for Sophia, who told me it gave her hope, for the first time, that they could bring about change within a company as powerful as Tyson.</p> <p>The Florida campaign had put workers\u2019 voices at the centre of the conversation with the brands who sourced their tomatoes in Immokalee. Licolli wondered if she could bring that model to the poultry industry. Instead of protesting, they would bring their fight to the household brands that buy Tyson chicken, such as McDonald\u2019s, Wendy\u2019s, Kroger and Chick-fil-A, Licolli said, \u201cby alerting consumers to the injustice behind their favourite foods\u201d. But in January 2019, when Licolli brought those ideas to the board of the Northwest Arkansas Workers\u2019 Justice Center, they were rejected. \u201cI was called a radical. And it\u2019s not that I am an extremist,\u201d she recalled. \u201cBut even the minimum effort of organising, it has to be radical. There is no sugar-coating our message for people to feel comfortable working with us.\u201d</p> <p>The clash over appropriate action proved irreparable, and in March, Licolli was dismissed as director of the centre. Subsequently, dozens of women, including Sophia, left. A few months later, the centre shut down. It had taken months for the women\u2019s campaign to get going again, but here they were, with their folding chairs and a new banner with a crowing rooster on it. \u201cBecause we are fighters,\u201d Licolli explained, as she went to work hanging it on the wall. On the banner was the name of their new labour organisation, Venceremos \u2013 meaning \u201cwe will win\u201d. The women spent the evening planning the public launch of the new organisation, and shared their concerns about how they would overcome the fear other workers had about organising.</p> <p>A few days later, Licolli drove up to a Springdale shopping centre for the official launch of Venceremos, where poultry workers were already waiting, having finished their day shifts at the nearby plants. She pinned up her rooster banner. The showing was better than she had hoped. Before she started, she asked all plant workers to raise their hands, and asked no one to post photos on social media from the event, fearing that Tyson might target them for retaliation. A reporter from Univision Arkansas came by, and a three-worker delegation arrived from Immokalee, including Gerardo Reyes Chavez. He believes the new workers\u2019 movement has potential. \u201cDespite all the circumstances they\u2019ve had to confront,\u201d he said, \u201cthey are really strong people, and they are trying to leave the world a better place than how the world has treated them.\u201d</p> <p>In January, workers noted increased shipments of peracetic acid to the Berry Street plant. Many workers were experiencing coughing, nose irritation and breathing problems. In mid-February, a group of 16 Venceremos workers walked into the office of a supervisor to tell them about the symptoms they were experiencing. The supervisor dismissed the idea that the chemicals were causing the symptoms, saying they sounded like the flu. However, he agreed to improve ventilation in the plant. Tyson said all employees working with chemicals were required to have training, maintain personal protective equipment, and were \u201cinstructed to report any irritations immediately to their manager\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> <p>In mid-March, with the number of Covid-19 cases rising across Arkansas, Sophia, like hundreds of other workers at the Berry Street plant, was given \u201cessential employee verification\u201d papers and told to keep them with her at all times. Sophia was deemed one of the nation\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/publication/guidance-essential-critical-infrastructure-workforce\" title=\"\">essential critical infrastructure</a>\u201d workers. She would be exempt from curfews, shelter-in-place orders and other mobility restrictions, so she might \u201cprovide services essential to the production of food\u201d.</p> <p>Five days a week, Sophia kept going to work on the evisceration line. Some days she woke up and felt the phantom balloon in her chest. She went to work anyway, fearful of losing a day\u2019s pay. When we spoke in March, she said there was no way to practise social distancing at the plant.</p> <p>\u201cWe are all standing close together all the time. I\u2019m afraid. It\u2019s not only about the line. When we finish our shift, or we come in to start, we all come in together through the same doors. If one of us gets sick, all of us get sick.\u201d</p> <p>Sophia read news reports of the virus with growing alarm. Then, after hearing rumours flying around Springdale about coronavirus spreading on processing lines, Sophia decided that, with her lungs already weakened from the chemical accident, she could not risk going to work. She stayed at home.</p> <p>Workers were calling Licolli for help and advice, many of them anxious about conditions in the plants. Licolli sent out a flurry of texts and began setting up conference and video calls with other poultry workers. They put together a list of demands. Venceremos members launched <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/tyson-foods-demand-poultry-plants-to-provide-paid-sick-days-for-their-hourly-workers?utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=custom_url&amp;recruited_by_id=73fcf380-f097-012f-fc86-4040aa777426\" title=\"\">an online petition</a> demanding that Tyson, and other poultry processors in Arkansas, provide paid sick leave to workers if they were forced to self-isolate at home, for all the days they must miss. Within days, the petition had nearly 8,000 signatures.</p> <p>On 13 March, Tyson had relaxed attendance policies for hourly workers: anyone who missed work due to illness from Covid-19 would not be fired or fined. On 31 March, it announced that workers would be eligible for short-term disability benefits should they fall ill. But it wouldn\u2019t cover their full pay, only 60%. And not all plant workers qualified. Pressed on the gaps in the policy\u2019s coverage for low-wage line workers, Tyson said in a statement: \u201cWe\u2019ll work with them to explore ways we can help. We want to help everyone, even if they don\u2019t have [health insurance] coverage.\u201d The company also said: \u201cIf a team member is quarantined because they have come in contact with someone who has tested positive for Covid-19, they receive full pay while they\u2019re out.\u201d</p> <p>On Monday, Tyson released a short video showing the measures it had put in place to prevent the spread of Covid-19 at the Berry Street plant, including allowing for social distancing. The company said that in March, it had begun testing workers\u2019 temperatures as they arrived for their shifts. In early April, it started distributing masks and putting up barriers between workers on the production lines.</p> <p>Workers did not seem to be reassured. The offer of $500 bonuses Tyson made to workers if they turned up for every shift for three months has backfired, Licolli told me. \u201cIt only made them more angry. They are risking their lives and this was nothing compared to the risks they are taking. They are afraid they might not even get the bonuses if they end up getting sick.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/apr/13/how-much-is-an-hour-worth-the-war-over-the-minimum-wage\">How much is an hour worth?

  "<p>\u201cMake America great again\u201d was an election winning slogan with a bold and simple message. \u201cOpening up America again\u201d proved to be less clear cut and left questions in the air.</p> <p>On Thursday Donald Trump unveiled federal staggered guidelines for getting America back to business after the shutdown forced by the coronavirus pandemic. He had previously billed it as the most important decision of his presidency, but what he called \u201ca science-based reopening\u201d was messier and more ill-defined.</p> <p>First, the good news. The 18-page document explicitly used the word \u201cguidelines\u201d \u2013 a far cry from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/13/trump-us-coronavirus-briefing-latest-media\">\u201ctotal authority\u201d</a> he claimed earlier this week. It delegates authority to state governors and city mayors to weigh the risk-to-reward ratio of opening businesses, churches and schools, which is the way it should be.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/michigan-protest-coronavirus-rightwing-support\">Protests against US stay-at-home orders gain support from rightwing figures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It also recognises the need to move gradually with baby steps, and the fact that America is vast \u2013 roughly the same size as Europe \u2013 with different needs in different places. \u201cWe are not opening all at once, but one careful step at a time, and some states, they will be able to open up sooner than others,\u201d the president said.</p> <p>Even Trump, who has turned his briefings into mini-campaign rallies, seemed relatively disciplined and focused at the White House on Thursday. He was broadly in step with his experts, Dr Deborah Birx and Dr Anthony Fauci. For all his wild words in recent weeks, including calling for the country to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/mar/24/trump-coronavirus-us-easter-new-york-fauci-birx\">reopen at Easter</a>, Trump has at least heeded the professionals when it came to extending physical distancing guidelines and now seeking to wind them down.</p> <p>The document proposes that, before reopening, states should see a decrease in confirmed Covid-19 cases over a 14-day period, have a \u201crobust testing system in place for at-risk healthcare workers\u201d, and hospitals should be able to \u201ctreat all patients without crisis care\u201d.</p> <p>But there are plenty of ambiguities. The guidelines do not give a firm target date. Trump said some states could reopen \u201ctomorrow\u201d but declined to name them. The guidelines emphasise the need for testing but do not make clear how many tests will be enough, nor set out a national testing strategy. Yet testing and contact tracing have been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/02/coronavirus-testing-how-some-countries-germany-south-korea-got-ahead-of-the-rest\">key to the relative success of countries</a> such as Germany and South Korea.</p> <p>House speaker Nancy Pelosi criticized the guidelines lack of clarity on a national testing strategy, saying in statement: \u201cTesting is the key to opening our country to resume our lives. The White House\u2019s vague and inconsistent document does nothing to make up for the president\u2019s failure to listen to the scientists and produce and distribute national rapid testing.\u201d</p> <p>In the absence of that secure knowledge, the public may not respond to Trump\u2019s summons. More than four in five people say Americans should \u201ccontinue to social distance for as long as is needed to curb the spread of coronavirus, even if it means continued damage to the economy\u201d, according to a Politico/Morning Consult poll released Wednesday.</p> <p>And even on one of his more restrained days, Trump made some worrying statements. He kept referring to the virus in the past tense, even as thousands of people continue to die every day. \u201cNow that we are past the peak in new cases, we are starting life again,\u201d he said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/santa-monica-nurses-suspended-n95-masks-coronavirus\">Ten nurses suspended for refusing to work without N95 masks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIf the virus returns in the fall as some scientists think it may, possibly, these guidelines will ensure the country is up and running so that we can likewise put it out quickly.\u201d</p> <p>Joe Lockhart, a former White House press secretary, tweeted: \u201cThat briefing had everything but the \u2018Mission Accomplished\u2019 banner. Now let\u2019s start ignoring the president and concentrate on where the power is: the states and cities.\u201d</p> <p>In the week that he <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/coronavirus-trump-halts-funding-to-world-health-organization\">halted funding to the World Health Organization</a>, Trump made reference to \u201ca cruel virus from a distant land\u201d and said border control and travel restrictions are more important than ever. He reflected: \u201cIn 1917, they went through something that was similar\u201d, \u2013 he was off by a year, as the Spanish flu was in 1918.</p> <p>And he told reporters: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to have a new normal. Normal is going to be if a restaurant had 158 seats filled before, they are going to have 158 seats filled again.\u201d Experts have warned such a prospect is still a very long way off.</p> <p>The political benefit of asking individual states to call the shots is that, if things go wrong, Trump will claim he is shielded from blame. He said: \u201cWe have some states that got too much credit for what they\u2019ve done, frankly. I could name you a couple of those.\u201d</p> <p>Trump described himself as a healer and claimed that partisan politics should be put aside. \u201cI don\u2019t care about campaigning,\u201d he said. But it will not be long, perhaps, before he is back on the trail.</p>"
