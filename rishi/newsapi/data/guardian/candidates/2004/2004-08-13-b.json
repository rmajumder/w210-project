  "<p>The first thing you notice as you approach John Kenneth Galbraith's home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, a stone's throw from Harvard University, is a \"Kerry/Edwards for president\" poster in a ground floor window, a hint of the politics that has dominated his life.</p> <p>At 95, Galbraith, one of the greatest political and economic thinkers of the past century, is still politically engaged, although ill health forced him to miss this year's Democrat convention in nearby Boston. </p> <p>The house is a large, New England-style, brick one, probably about as old as its owner, who has lived there for 50 years with his wife Kitty, now in her early 90s. </p> <p>Once past the front porch, the atmosphere is not of affluence, written so much about by Galbraith, but old-world charm. There is heavy wood panelling in the main hall and adjoining room, and classic furniture dominates the place. </p> <p>\"That you? Glad you could come. I love the Guardian. Been reading it since 1937,\" booms a voice from the large, book-lined library off the main hall. </p> <p>The great man is quite deaf now and slumped in a chair but still has the aura and stature that his 6ft 8in frame has always commanded. His wit and intellect are still very much intact. </p> <p>He barks at our photographer to make sure he gets a picture of him sitting as straight as his advanced years will allow. </p> <p>Galbraith is in poor health and reclusive, the famous parties he and Kitty used to throw a thing of the past. But he is happy to talk about his new book, The Economics of Innocent Fraud: Truth for our Time, that comes almost half a century after his most famous work, The Affluent Society. </p> <p>He is excited that edited extracts from the new book, published in the Guardian a couple of weeks ago, were widely distributed and discussed at the Democrat convention. He is, in fact, happy to talk about pretty much anything. </p> <p>Galbraith was born into a rural Scottish family in Canada in 1908 and moved to the US in the early 1930s, taking American citizenship in 1937. In his early professional life, during the depression, he worked as an economist for Franklin D Roosevelt. </p> <p>He recalls sitting in his office one day during the second world war - he was in charge of controlling prices throughout the economy - when his secretary said someone wanted to see him. \"I said I had no time. But she said 'I think he expects to see you' and gave me his business card. It was John Maynard Keynes. He wanted to talk about agricultural prices.\" Keynes, he said, was interested in the relationship between the prices of livestock and livestock feed. </p> <p>Galbraith, who was given the wartime job while in his early 30s and eventually ran a staff of nearly 1,500, recalls how he and his workers relished the tale of a hungry colony of ants, antennae quivering with excitement at the sight of a pile of horse manure. </p> <p>\"When an industrialist, already making more money than in the previous decade, came to see us to ask permission to put his prices up, my staff and I would quiver our index finger and the next one to it on the desk, as a sign to each other that the guy was talking horse shit.\" His sense of humour is undiminished. </p> <p>Looking back over a career spanning 70 years, Galbraith says he is most proud of the work on prices he was asked to do by Roosevelt, who was worried about the rampant inflation seen during the first world war. \"The fact that we came through the second world war with no appreciable price inflation and no depressive aftermath was by far the most important thing with which I have ever been associated,\" he says. </p> <p>\"I still have a puzzlement, even at my present advanced age, as to how Roosevelt could have entrusted that to anyone so young. It is also a possibility that no one older or wiser would take it on.\" </p> <p>How well did he know FDR? \"I was less intimate with him than with Keynes. I knew Eleanor Roosevelt better and she was my avenue to the president if I needed to speak to him.\" </p> <p>His experience of the depression years and working on FDR's New Deal programme have made him a lifelong Democrat. He has known every president since, and worked for John F Kennedy as ambassador to India in the early 1960s. </p> <p>As the war ended, he was asked to carry out a survey of the US and allied strategic bombing during the war. His conclusion, that it served no use and did nothing to shorten the war, did not endear him to the military-industrial complex, as Dwight D Eisenhower later called it, of the time. Eisenhower, as wartime general and postwar president, would have known. </p> <p>Galbraith says the issue delayed his appointment as a Harvard professor by a year, to 1948. It was there that his writing career took off. His definitive history of the great crash of 1929 appeared in 1955, followed three years later by The Affluent Society, which is still required reading for social science students. </p> <p>In it he developed the idea that modern economies are dominated by producer power, with firms deciding what to make and then persuading people to buy it through advertising. Thus, people preferred to spend money on things they often did not need rather than on good schools, hospitals, roads and so on. </p> <p>He coined the phrases \"conventional wisdom\" and \"private affluence, public squalor\", still in common usage today. </p> <p>The book sold millions of copies and he became as much of a household name as an economist can be. He fell out of favour in the 1980s of Reaganomics and Thatcherism, when the views of economists such as Milton Friedman held sway and Keynesians, who believe in public spending as a way out of recession, were in retreat.</p> <p>But Galbraith, who has published more than 20 books, remains undimmed in his passion for what he believes is right. </p> <p>The new book explores many modern themes including the ever-growing power of corporations, excessive executive pay and the Iraq war. Many of these issues represent the peddling of an innocent fraud, as he calls it. </p> <p>For example, company managements tell us they work for, and answer to, their shareholders whereas in fact they work for themselves and answer to no one, except when things go really wrong, as in the case of Enron. </p> <p>\"Corporate power is exercised not by investors but, frequently at their expense, by those who wield the real corporate power. There has come into the American language for the first time a brand new phrase 'the corporate scandal'.\" </p> <p>He confesses he does not know where it will all end. \"It will depend on public action. But I do not expect the sort of vigorous and dynamic limitation of corporate power we need from the likes of George Bush.\"</p> <p>Has not Bush's presidency, I suggest, been characterised by tax cuts for the rich, an explosion in directors' pay and, of course, the Iraq war? </p> <p>\"I would respectfully disagree,\" he says with a twinkle in his eye. \"George Bush's political, intellectual and other shortcomings cannot be restricted to a single sentence or two. He presides over a context far more complex and authoritative than he could possibly understand.\" </p> <p>So how important is it that Bush lose the November election? \"That is a good, even decisive question. The power of the modern economic enterprise will be great whoever is president. But the chance of a detached control, limited but characterised by effort, will be much the strongest with a Democratic president and Congress.\" </p> <p>Galbraith, a critic in the 1960s of the Vietnam war, is less than impressed by the Iraq conflict. \"It is my definite belief that it is the biggest military misadventure in US history. And I think in future the possibility of further military conflict will be a source of deep anxiety.\"</p> <p>War, Galbraith says in the conclusion to his new book, \"remains the decisive human failure\", a dark cloud atop the white tower of human achievement. </p> <p>He has a lot of sympathy for Tony Blair, who he says must have agonised over his decision to back Bush over the war. But Blair's raising of taxes to spend on health and education fit Galbraith's philosophy. </p> <p>\"I am an admiring observer and sometime friend of your prime minister. He seems a very responsible leader facing very difficult choices, particularly because of the war.\" </p> <p>Galbraith plans further work, health allowing. He intends looking further at the structure and functioning of companies. His great-grandfather lived to 110, so he feels he still has time.</p> <p><strong>The CV</strong></p> <p><strong>Age</strong> 95</p> <p><strong>Education</strong> Willey School, Dunwich, Ontario.

  "<b>Independent</b> <br>Editorial, August 13 <p>\"[Jose Manuel Barroso, the incoming president of the European commission] unveiled the portfolios for the 24 men and women who will from November 1 steer the EU over the coming five years ... The biggest surprise was that Mr Barroso gave charge of competition and the internal market to the Netherlands and Ireland respectively. Both are areas in which the French and Germans have repeatedly clashed with the outgoing commission in pursuit of their own narrow national interests. This was Mr Barroso's boldest demonstration of the independence so vital to his role, and as such is reassuring. If his first act sets the tone for the rest of his presidency, he will be a difficult president to push around and will safeguard his own position's essential neutrality. Anyone who truly has the interests of Europe at heart will warmly welcome this.\" </p> <p><b>Wall Street Journal Europe</b><br>Editorial, August 13 </p> <p>\"When [Mr Barroso on Thursday] announced the composition of his commission, it marked the end of an era. Since the EU's birth almost 50 years ago, the Franco-German axis has been driving its agenda - with the French clearly in the driver's seat. But as Mr Barroso read the names of the commissioners he had chosen for the key portfolios, it became clear that the centre of gravity has shifted: the Franco-German axis might still exist but it is not calling the shots. Almost none of the duo's central demands had been met while all important economic positions went to avowed free-marketers ... It is hard to imagine a greater setback for Franco-German ambitions in Europe than Mr Barroso's nomination.\" </p> <p><b>Gilles Bridier</b><br>La Tribune, France, August 13 </p> <p>\"In the Barroso commission, the Franco-German axis ... will play a secondary role. Is this the revenge of the 'little countries' against the economic powerhouses of Europe? ... Of course, we must not judge the commissioners and analyse their posts on the basis of their nationalities since, once they are in Brussels, they will be expected to renounce their national allegiances. But by showing themselves to be inflexible over the presence of representatives of each one of them at the heart of the commission, the new members of the union have seriously undermined this dogma. As such, the Barroso commission will mark a turning point in the history of Europe. What new role will the old Franco-German motor play there, diluted and dismissed in a wider EU?\" </p> <p><b>Martin Halusa</b><br>Die Welt, Germany, August 13 </p> <p>\"Mr Barroso has sent out a clear signal: economic and industrial policy has again been given top importance ... [He] has put the economic recovery of Europe at the top of his list of priorities ... In order to lend more weight to his ambitious plan, he has given the industry commissioner G\u00fcnther Verheugen the office of vice-president. The Germans therefore are awarded the central position that [Chancellor] Gerhard Schr\u00f6der wanted. Mr Barroso was the third-rate choice in the election for commission president. But it seems he has already cast off this stigma.\" </p> <p><b>El Mundo</b><br>Editorial, Spain, August 13 </p> <p>\"The birth of the new European commission does not hold any surprises. Mr Barroso inherited the script and handed the most relevant portfolios to the most powerful countries ... But this fair division of power is nothing more than an illusion. States such as Malta or Slovenia are relegated to having commissioners with virtually no weight while the big countries monopolise those which will be involved in important decisions. The obvious case is Germany, whose representative, Mr Verheugen, wins one of the vice-presidencies ... Spain came out of it better than expected ... Mr Barroso and his team face the challenge of ... raising the esteem of a body discredited by corruption and bureaucracy among its citizens.\" </p> <p><b>Daily Telegraph</b><br>Editorial, August 13 </p> <p>\"Mr Barroso himself is a compromise choice as president-designate, but his Atlanticist outlook, and the fact that France and Germany were unable to force their preference for Guy Verhofstadt [the Belgian prime minister] on the rest of the union, makes him a much better candidate than that would imply. His abilities and the generally reformist views of the new EU members could yet restore the reputation of a deeply discredited body.\" </p> <p><b>Times</b><br>Editorial, August 13 </p> <p>\"[Mr Barroso] has sent out the admirable message that serious economic reform will be ... his greatest priority. His appointments should at least allow him some hope of pursuing that agenda. Allowing Peter Mandelson to take charge of trade is a positive move, he is well qualified for the job ... Mr Mandelson has an especially enticing role ahead of him. With the Doha round of international trade talks having been revived by the conclusion of a tentative pact on agriculture ... two weeks ago, he has the opening to fashion a comprehensive agreement. His strong commitment to this cause and undoubted intelligence should prove assets in that enterprise. If successful, he will have far more impact on many more people (particularly the world's poor) in more places than he could have achieved as a minister in Britain.\"</p>",
  "Two cardinal laws govern negative advertisements. One: they work. Two: the way to combat them is to answer fire with fire. The John Kerry campaign seems to be overlooking both at their peril. <p>When an attack ad from the Republican slime brigade Swiftboat Veterans for Truth - which claimed that Kerry's Vietnam heroism was a fraud - surfaced last week, the initial response of the Kerry campaign team was to ignore it. </p> <p>Surely, they thought, reasonable-minded people would never take seriously the scurrilous charge that Kerry did not deserve his medals for valour. Surely it would backfire. Besides, it was only running in three states in minor media markets, so only a few people would see it anyway.</p> <p>But it hasn't worked out that way. The ad picked up a ton of free media coverage, precisely because its charges are so outrageous. </p> <p>It was a dangerous miscalculation to assume that people for whom Vietnam is not even a distant memory would give Kerry the benefit of the doubt. For many voters - particularly the least engaged, and therefore those who have not yet decided who they will vote for - this story is the first they are hearing about who John Kerry is. </p> <p>So the initial decision not to respond was plain wrong. Now that Kerry has woken up to the potential damage of this smear campaign, his response so far - to use free news media - has been inadequate and, to some extent, self-defeating. </p> <p>The news media inevitably frames allegations, irrespective of their merit, in the terms of a legitimate debate. The point/counterpoint format of TV news in particular makes equivalents of two opposing arguments, regardless of the credibility of either one. So baseless charges get elevated to a level allowing the viewer to make his or her own judgement. </p> <p>John McCain's support, calling for the Bush campaign to denounce the ad as \"dishonourable and dishonest\", is useful, and a Wall Street Journal op-ed from Jim Rassmann - whose life Kerry saved in Vietnam - is also helpful. However, in a medium that lives by the rules of equal time, such fine words are not enough.</p> <p>Kerry's other response so far, to threaten legal action against the TV stations running the ads, smacks of Stalinist-style censorship and a peevishness that sends entirely the wrong message.</p> <p>Note to Kerry: this is a campaign for the world's most powerful job. People are going to say mean things about you. They may even lie. Get used to it, and react accordingly. You need to win this battle in the court of public opinion, not in some dry legal setting.</p> <p>The only way to fight such slurs is by hitting back with paid media in the same markets in which the original appeared - in this case the battleground states of Wisconsin, Ohio and West Virginia, where only a few changed minds could make the difference between defeat and victory. </p> <p>Such an ad could be produced in an afternoon. It would feature Jim Rassmann, talking straight to camera, mixed with images of him with Kerry in Vietnam, and it would say something like this:</p> <p>\"Some people are spreading lies about the man who saved my life. This man was my swiftboat commander in Vietnam, John Kerry. When I was blown off the boat into the Mekong river, under enemy fire, my skipper risked his life to pull me back to safety. He won the bronze star for that act. </p> <p>\"But some people, who were not there, are saying it did not happen. Well I was there, and I wouldn't be alive today had it not been for his selfless heroism.</p> <p>\"Now, I don't know why these people are spreading these lies, but I do know that the ad is paid for by Republican activists. It's sad to see some people dishonouring those who risked their life for their country just to score political points.\"</p> <p>If pride is getting in the way of Kerry giving the go-ahead to such an ad, his advisers are not serving him well. If he is insisting on keeping to the high road on this issue, his advisers need to grab him by the shoulders, look him in the eye and tell him that there's a time for the high road - and this isn't it.</p> <p>George Bush's failure to disavow the swiftboat ad only underscores only one thing - his attack machine is just getting started. More misery is on the way. John McCain - the reluctant Bush backer who rose to Kerry's defence last week - knows only too well what it means to stick to the high road when your opponent is in the gutter.</p> <p>In the 2000 race for the Republican nomination, McCain had just racked up a 19-point win over Bush in the New Hampshire primary. </p> <p>He came to South Carolina, one win away from glory, when he fell victim to a classic Bush smear campaign. Republican operatives on the Bush-Cheney payroll, posing as pollsters, phoned likely McCain supporters and asked them whether they would be more or less likely to vote for McCain if they knew he had fathered an illegitimate child who was black. </p> <p>It didn't matter that the charges weren't true, and it didn't matter that the news media exposed the smear - McCain's decision not to spend campaign funds to fight back sunk him.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Philip James is a former senior Democratic party strategist</p>",
  "<p>A former Liberal Democrat group president is petitioning residents to replace the Lib Dem leadership of Torbay council with an elected mayor, after councillors awarded themselves two increases in allowances in just nine months.</p> <p>David Scott has been backed by his daily local paper, the Herald and Express, which has issued petition forms in its pages over the past two months. He has put \u00a3500 of his own money into launching a website for his campaign to oust the current leadership.</p> <p>The Lib Dem council has hit the headlines on several occasions in the 13 months since it came to power following a landslide victory in June 2003, when it ousted the Tory administration.</p> <p>Within six months of being in power, the Lib Dem cabinet twice increased councillor allowances by a total of 65%, followed by a council tax rise of 9.9%.</p> <p>The tax rise was deemed \"unacceptable\" and led to the local authority being one of only six councils to be capped by the local government minister, Nick Raynsford.</p> <p>Mr Scott, who is a former journalist, quit his seat as local president of the Liberal Democrat group, and resigned from the party in disgust. He claimed the total councillor allowance bill had soared from \u00a3270,000 to \u00a3447,000 after his party came to power.</p> <p>Following public pressure, the council agreed to drop its allowance increase from 65% to 43%.</p> <p>In a separate petition, 25,000 residents have protested against the council's decision to close down 19 of the 40 public toilets in the holiday resort in a bid to save \u00a3190,000.</p> <p>Mr Scott is seeking an elected mayor to replace the current leadership, and has issued a separate petition, also being distributed by the local paper to establish town councils in the unitary authority's three main towns: Paignton, Torquay and Brixham.</p> <p>He has collected 3,200 signatures in two months, and has until next March to collect the 5,012 needed to trigger a mayoral referendum, equating to the 5% backing required from the local electorate. Mr Scott said he had no intention to stand for elected mayor himself. </p> <p>\"What we are lacking here is strong leadership, vision and direction\", he said. \"All I am doing is giving the public who feel frustrated a voice. We have not got another election for another three years. I am giving them an option.\"</p> <p>Just one year on in their four-year tenure, the Liberal Democrats have plummeted in the polls, with a double byelection held last week seeing their share of the vote drop from 34% to 11%, and ending up in fifth place after two Tory and two UK independence party candidates.</p> <p>The council's leader, Chris Harris, said he had \"no doubt\" the 5% target would be reached, but remained sceptical that voters would back an elected mayor. </p> <p>He said the electorate would get their say in three years. \"We are an improving council,\" he said. \"The cost of a referendum is going to be \u00a360,000. I have no doubt he [Mr Scott] will get his numbers, but \u00a360,000 is another waste of tax payers' money and could not that open a few more public toilets? It is a case of trying to cut your nose off to spite your face.</p>",
  "On a balmy spring evening in Lisbon Tony Blair set in motion the events that led to yesterday's appointment of Peter Mandelson as one of the EU's senior political figures. <p>Over dinner in the ornate splendour of the Pestana Palace Hotel he told Jose Manuel Barroso that he would be delighted to see him become president of the European commission.</p> <p>As he flew off in the early hours of the following morning for his historic \"tent\" summit with Colonel Muammar Gadafy, the prime minister had no idea that his closest political ally would land one of the most significant EU jobs five months later.</p> <p>But the warmth of his encounter with Mr Barroso put Britain at an advantage when commission jobs were being handed out.</p> <p>\"It is one of the most important posts in the new commission,\" Denis MacShane, the Europe minister said. \"The anti-Europeans in London do not understand the extent to which Britain is seen as a major European nation again after the years of Tory isolationism.\"</p> <p>The former trade commissioner Lord Brittan who, like Mr Mandelson, served as trade and industry secretary before moving to Brussels, said: \"Frankly it is more important than most cabinet jobs. You are negotiating on behalf of the EU with the USA, Japan, China and the WTO.\"</p> <p>Such a prominent post, involving a lot of travel, will force Mr Mandelson to make a decisive break with British politics, at least for the next five years.</p> <p>In the run-up to next year's general election, when Mr Blair would be expected to turn to his old friend for candid political advice, Mr Mandelson will be immersed in trade negotiations.</p> <p> Most Labour MPs, who have despaired at the continuing influence of Mr Mandelson, will be delighted to see the back of such a prickly figure.</p> <p>But Mr Mandelson is delighted to have secured the trade portfolio - with international competitiveness thrown in for good measure - which will force him to forge a political identity in his own right.</p> <p>In his three ministerial posts in Labour's first term, Mr Mandelson was seen as Tony Blair's enforcer.</p> <p>Hearing his soft, and at times slightly menacing, voice on the phone signalled to ministers that a prime ministerial decree was being issued.</p> <p>In Brussels and the world capitals where he will negotiate Europe's trade deals Mr Mandelson's closeness to Mr Blair will still count.</p> <p>But it will not be enough on its own, and he will need to establish new alliances.</p> <p>Neil Kinnock, one of Britain's outgoing commissioners, who hired Mr Mandelson as Labour communications director in the 1980s, is understood to fear that he will have difficulty fitting in with the commission's consensual style.</p> <p>But one friend said Mr Mandelson was well placed for networking in Europe and beyond. \"Peter's Policy Network outfit has kept him in touch with senior European figures and the Clinton people,\" an ally said.</p> <p>\"He has walk-in rights all over the US, in a way that some of the other Europeans haven't. He is seen as a very, very serious figure.\"</p> <p>While his Labour enemies will happily wave farewell to Mr Mandelson when he takes the Eurostar to Brussels, they may find that his influence on British politics remains as strong as ever.</p> <p>As a member of Mr Barroso's inner team pushing through economic reforms - the \"Lisbon agenda\"- he will play a decisive role in trying to meet Gordon Brown's \"sixth test\" for British membership of the euro.</p> <p>The chancellor has said Britain cannot contemplate joining until Europe reforms its hidebound economies.</p> <p>\"If I were prime minister I would be very pleased with this appointment,\" Lord Brittan said waspishly.</p> <p><b>The stars of the show</b></p> <p><b> ****</b><br> <b>Jose Manuel Barroso (president)</b> <br>Ex-Maoist, centre-right former Portuguese prime minister</p> <p><b>***</b> <br><b>Peter Mandelson (trade)</b><br> Key Blair ally, will have role in pushing economic reform</p> <p><b> Neelie Kroes-Smit (competition)</b><br> Dutch transport expert who will have to drop directorships</p> <p><b> Charlie McCreevy (internal market)</b><br> Domestically unpopular former Irish finance minister</p> <p><b>G\u00fcnter Verheugen (vice-president, enterprise and industry)</b><br> Close ally of Gerhard Schr\u00f6der</p> <p><b> Joaqu\u00edn Almunia (economic and monetary affairs)</b><br>Spanish socialist</p> <p><b>**</b><br> <b>Jacques Barrot (vice-president, transport) </b><br> French centre-right minister, will have to pacify unions</p> <p><b> Margot Wallstr\u00f6m (vice-president, institutional relations and communication)</b><br> Tipped as future Swedish PM</p> <p><b>Danuta Huebner (regional policy)</b><br> Polish free-market economist</p> <p><b> Siim Kallas (vice-president, audit and anti-fraud)</b><br> Ex Estonia prime minister, popular with Blair<br></p> <p><b>Joe Borg (fisheries and maritime affairs)</b><br> Malta's former foreign affairs minister</p> <p><b>Dalia Grybauskaite (financial programming and budget)</b><br> Former minister of finance</p> <p><b>Louis Michel (development) </b><br> Former Belgian foreign minister, annoyed US over Iraq</p> <p><b>Ollie Rehn (enlargement) </b><br> Finnish superbrain, youngest commissioner</p> <p><b>Mariann Fischer Boel (agriculture)</b><br> Danish farm minister, family of landowners<br><br> <b>Benita Ferrero-Waldner (external relations)</b><br> Aristocratic Austrian</p> <p><b>Vladimir Spidla (employment and social affairs)</b><br> Former Czech prime minister, with limited English </p> <p><b>Ingrida Udre (taxation and customs union) </b><br> Former speaker of Latvia's parliament and fan of the game of basketball</p> <p><b> Rocco Buttiglione (vice-president, justice, freedom and security)</b><br> Will deal with asylum issues</p> <p><b>*</b></p> <p><b>Vivian Reding (information society and media)</b><br> Bouffanted Luxembourger, Cannes film festival-goer </p> <p><b>Stavros Dimas (environment) </b><br> Greek free market economist</p> <p><b> Janez Potocnik (science and research) </b><br> Former Slovenian Europe minister</p> <p><b>Jan Figel (education, training and culture)</b><br> Former Slovakian chief negotiator of entry to the EU</p> <p><b> Markos Kyprinaou (health and consumer protection)</b><br> Cypriot lawyer and ex-finance minister</p> <p><b> Laszlo Kovasc (energy)</b><br> 65-year-old former Hungarian foreign minister </p> <p><b>* Stars denote relative importance</b></p>",

Mr Blair \"desperately tried to keep his long-time confidant on board\", the paper says, by offering him a post in a third Labour term if he agreed to stay in Westminster. </p> <p>Mr Mandelson's was one of 24 appointments handed down by the EU's president-delegate, Jose Manuel Barroso, a former prime minister of Portugal. </p> <p>The Telegraph praises both Mr Barroso and the 10 new member states that he will preside over following their accession earlier this year. \"His abilities, and the generally reformist views of the new EU members, could yet restore the reputation of a deeply discredited body,\" the paper says. </p> <p>The Independent calls him \"an astute politician, impressively equipped for the wheeling and dealing his job requires\". </p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Politics/eu/story/0,9061,1282263,00.html\">Trade role elevates Mandelson to Europe's inner circle</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1214994,00.html\">Times: The cabinet offer Mandelson refused</a></p> <p><b>GREEK ATHLETE FACES DISCIPLINARY HEARING</b></p> <p>Greek sprinter Kostas Kederis, the man expected to light the Olympic flame at tonight's opening ceremony in Athens, has been summoned to a disciplinary hearing after failing to attend a drugs test. </p> <p>Both Kederis and fellow sprinter Katerina Thanou failed to appear for scheduled tests, but the issue was complicated by reports that the athletes were in hospital after being slightly injured in a motorcycle accident. The two are due to attend an IOC hearing this morning. </p> <p>The Guardian wonders whether the Olympics have grown to an almost unmanageable size - 11,150 competitors are expected in Athens. \"The time may come when the International Olympics Committee has to rethink the whole procedure by which individual cities bid for the event and then try to cram it within their municipal boundaries,\" the paper says. </p> <p>* <a href=\"http://sport.theguardian.com/olympics2004/athletics/story/0,,1282249,00.html\">Kederis test crisis rocks Athens</a><br> * <a href=\"http://sport.theguardian.com/olympics2004/othersports/story/0,,1282168,00.html\">Going for gold</a></p> <p><b>ERRORS 'CAUSE 40,000 HOSPITAL DEATHS A YEAR'</b></p> <p>The Times leads with a disturbing report that says medial accidents and errors are directly blamed for 40,000 deaths in NHS hospitals each year. Around one in ten people treated by the NHS fall victim to an error of some sort, and about half the fatal mistakes are preventable, according to research published in the British Medical Journal today. </p> <p>Approximately a quarter of the mistakes happened during surgery, with another quarter taking place in diagnosis or pre-care. The rest occurred on the ward, and ranged from giving the wrong medication to providing inadequate nutrition. </p> <p>\"People would be concerned about flying with an airline which had two crashes. That's an infinitessimal risk when compared with a problem of this magnitude,\" Roger Taylor, research director at Dr Foster - which wrote the report - said. </p> <p>The Sun piles in with an investigation into hygiene standards in hospitals, and an undercover reporter found guidelines meant to prevent MRSA infection were being flouted. </p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1214427,00.html\">Times: Blundering hospitals are 'killing 40,000 patients a year'</a> * <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2004372247,,00.html\">Sun: MRSA hygiene is ignored</a></p> <p><b>SWEETNESS AND BITE</b></p> <p>Surely nobody out there had equated Kellogg's Frosties with a bowl of unsweetened muesli - but it is, nevertheless, something of a surprise to learn that those tooth-achingly sweet little flakes are made up of 38% sugar. In the light of rising levels of child obesity and so on, the company has decided to introduce a reduced sugar version of the cereal. </p> <p>However, that version will still be one quarter pure sugar. Kellogg's believed a further cut would make Frosties \"unpalatable\", the Guardian reports. To whom? Hummingbirds? </p> <p>The Mirror points out that the new Frosties will contain 20% more salt than the original version, and quotes nutritionists as saying that high salt content can cause more long-term damage than the sugar levels. </p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/food/Story/0,2763,1282245,00.html\">Kellogg's cuts sugar to placate critics</a></p> <p><b>HOT CROSS BUNNY</b></p> <p>Some of the papers carry the story of \"a very hot cross bunny\", as the Times puts it.

The terrified animal disappeared into the groundsman's hut, setting it ablaze and causing an estimated \u00a360,000 worth of damage. </p> <p>\"The fine turf mower, the big diesel mower, wheelbarrows, brushes, all the bits and pieces collected over the years - all gone,\" said Richard Read, the ground committee chairman for the old Devizes club, in Wiltshire. </p> <p>The rabbit's fate seems uncertain. The Telegraph quotes the local fire station commander as saying that it had not been possible to save the poor thing.

  "Europe's new great and good were given a shock late on Wednesday night when Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso hit the phones. <p>Weeks of patient negotiations - with a little arm twisting thrown in - had paid off when Europe's next commission president told confidants that he was ready to unveil his new team a week ahead of schedule.</p> <p>\"It was not until Wednesday night that we heard the news,\" one senior British figure said. \"Doing this a week early shows how tough Barroso is - I do not know of any occasion where he has been frustrated.\"</p> <p>The scale of Mr Barroso's achievement was apparent when the smiling former Maoist stood up at a Brussels press conference yesterday to announce how he was distributing the 24 commission posts, which carry a salary of \u00a3142,000. Weeks after France and Germany tried to impose their own plans for the next commission, Mr Barroso declared that he was placing \"reform-minded commissioners\" in the key economic posts.</p> <p>In the jargon of Europe this hailed an end to the days when France and Germany, the two original driving forces behind the EU, could expect their wishes to be met. The key posts went, in the words of one British official, to \"like-minded people\".</p> <p>The four senior figures are Peter Mandelson, who takes over trade; Charlie McCreevy, the avuncular racing fanatic and former Irish finance minister who takes charge of the internal market; Neelie Kroes-Smit, the Dutch transport expert, who takes over at competition; and G\u00fcnter Verheugen, the commission vice-president, who takes over at enterprise and industry - and is the only figure from what Donald Rumsfeld would call \"old Europe\" at the top table. But he is said to be personally committed to the \"Lisbon agenda\" of economic reforms.</p> <p>Alasdair Murray, of the Centre for European Reform, described the appointments as a major setback for Jacques Chirac and Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, who had alienated their European counterparts with heavy-handed tactics. Mr Chirac pushed hard for Guy Verhofstadt, the Belgian prime minister, to be made commission president, while Mr Schr\u00f6der tried to win a \"super-commissioner\" post encompassing the four economic portfolios.</p> <p>\"I think France and Germany boxed Barroso in a way that he could never have given them what they wanted,\" Mr Murray said. \"He would have been perceived as being weak from day one. The Germans, in particular, massively over-played their hand. Verheugen is a second-term commissioner from a major member state. He was always going to get a big post.\"</p> <p>He added: \"They tried to double-guess Barroso and haven't got anything like what they wanted.\" </p> <p>As he suns himself on the Indian Ocean island of R\u00e9union, Mr Chirac will be left to reflect that Britain emerged as one of the main winners as the \"Lisbon agenda\" receives a big boost. France fared badly when Jacques Barrot, at 76 the eldest commissioner, landed the mid-ranking job of transport. </p> <p>Ulrike Gu\u00e9rot, director of foreign policy at the German Marshall Fund in Berlin, said Tony Blair should be delighted. \"The Brits needed an important political dossier. It adds credibility to the EU's position internationally and it's an important dossier in terms of the transatlantic relationship.\" </p> <p>Lest the British crow too much, some commentators doubt whether Mr Barroso sees economic reform in the same radical terms as Mr Blair and Mr Mandelson. Mr Barroso himself stresses the need to protect the European social model - code for workers' protection. </p> <p>Kirsty Hughes, a visiting fellow at the LSE and former senior advisor to the commission, said: \"Barroso is very much a continental European and the British interpretation of the Lisbon agenda is very different from his. It's not about liberalising.\" </p> <p>Mr Barroso's strong start is likely to raise expectations that he will be a strong commission president, unlike the lacklustre incumbents of recent years. Romano Prodi, who stands down this autumn, appeared to be more interested in unseating Silvio Berlusconi as Italian prime minister. Jacques Santer, the bland former Luxembourg prime minister, never recovered from financial scandals in the commission. </p> <p>Eurosceptics will fear that a strong commission president could lead to a repeat of the era of Jacques Delors, the French commission president who horrified Margaret Thatcher with his attempts to forge an \"ever closer union\".</p> <p>Downing Street believes Mr Barroso will be a far more sensitive figure. Elected as Portugal's prime minister just over three years ago, he made an immediate impression in Brussels and Strasbourg with his language skills. He speaks French and English as fluently as his native Portuguese.</p> <p>When he appeared before the European parliament, which had the right to veto his appointment, Mr Barroso charmed his audience, which included many MEPs who were highly sceptical. On his weakest point - his decision to host Mr Blair and George Bush for a council of war in the Azores on the eve of the Iraq conflict - Mr Barroso skilfully won round his audience. </p> <p>\"There are magnificent things that exist in the US as well as some fairly horrific things,\" he declared in remarks which ensured he comfortably won the parliament's support. \"I hate their arrogance, I hate their unilateralism.\" </p> <p>His record as prime minister shows that he is a pragmatist.</p> <p><b>The intray</b></p> <p><b>Tasks ahead</b></p> <p><b>\u00b7</b><b> Completing a new world trade deal</b> </p> <p>The round of trade talks nearly collapsed earlier this month but are on track after an 11th-hour deal.
