  "A downpour had been expected in Baghdad, and it arrived right on cue. <p>The predictions had been for mortar bombs, of course, not rain, but the thud of shells exploding so close to Baghdad's convention centre caused scarcely a blink among the delegates to the much-anticipated national conference gathered inside. </p> <p>Some were asked to move away from the windows, while it was explained that Saddam Hussein had built the centre to withstand direct hits. </p> <p>The delegates knew what to expect and appeared neither shaken nor disturbed. </p> <p>\"I came here from Najaf so my voice could be heard,\" said one woman, a teacher. \"Do you think I'm going to be silenced by a few mortar shells?\" </p> <p>She, like everyone else, had come from across Iraq yesterday, defying the parlous security situation. There were tribal sheikhs from Kirkuk, women's activists from Basra, businessmen from Falluja and former peshmerga from Kurdistan. There were Muslims, Yezidis, Shabaks, Christians, Turkomen, Kurds and Arabs. There were teachers, judges, doctors and preachers. </p> <p>It was the first time since the fall of Saddam that Iraq's disparate and often discordant voices could be heard in one place. And for those desperate to see some light at the end of the tunnel it was a long-awaited first step. </p> <p>Held under the shadow of the insurgency and counter-insurgency, that the conference was taking place at all was seen as a victory. </p> <p>\"Your presence here today is the biggest challenge to the forces of darkness that want to tear this country apart,\" the prime minister, Ayad Allawi, said in his opening remarks. \"This is not the end of the road, it is the first step on the way to democracy.\" </p> <p>The task before them is to elect Iraq's first post-Saddam assembly and start a \"national dialogue\" on the country's most pressing problems. </p> <p>It was words, not bullets, that did the fizzing. A delegate from the province of Anbar in the Sunni triangle called for self-rule for his region. Another from Basra complained about the marginalisation of Iraq's second city. </p> <p>A woman from Najaf raged against the occupation of her home town - not by US forces but by the black-shirted young men of Moqtada al-Sadr's Mahdi army. </p> <p>From the outset, the violence in the holy city of Najaf threatened to dominate proceedings. If the Americans or the interim government were expecting a pat on the back for their tough stand, they had to think again. </p> <p>As the opening session wound up - after speeches from the Iraqi president, Ghazi al-Yawer, the prime minister, and the UN special representative, Ashraf Qazi - a group of Shia delegates standing near the back started to heckle, then to chant. </p> <p>\"Yes, yes Najaf,\" they shouted, punching the air with clenched fists. \"We want the president to hear what we have to say. Unless the blood shed in Najaf stops, we will withdraw.\" </p> <p>Iraq's new political leaders were sanguine. \"The point of this conference is to get talking to one another, to get some kind of national dialogue going,\" said Hamid al-Khifai, the cabinet spokesman. </p> <p>\"Najaf is an emotive issue and it is understandable that it be raised. If you had shouted like that under Saddam you would have been taken out and shot.\" </p> <p>The conference organisers decided to deal directly with the issue. They passed a resolution calling on all sides in the conflict to stop the violence, and appointed a negotiating committee to try to find a solution. </p> <p>Then it was on with other important business: the election of the interim assembly and the creation of four working groups dealing with topics such as security, transitional justice, and reconstruction. The delegates will elect 80 of the 100 seats in the assembly, with the remaining 20 going to former members of the governing council. </p> <p>The assembly, or Iraqi national council, will have the power to veto legislation with a two-thirds majority, approve Iraq's 2005 budget, and appoint a new prime minister or president should either resign or die in office. </p> <p>There were of course some who stayed away, whether out of pique at not being given the prominence they thought they deserved or because they preferred not to have anything to do with the interim government or its American backers. </p> <p>Mr Allawi insisted the political process was open to all. But the selection of delegates had been criticised for not being inclusive enough, and organisers were accused of stacking the conference with pro-government delegates. </p> <p>The most important absence was that of Mr Sadr's movement. Although organisers continued to insist that he or his representatives were welcome, the militant cleric under siege in Najaf shunned the invitation. </p> <p>There was no show either by Ahmad Chalabi, the controversial leader of the Iraqi National Congress. Mr Chalabi is wanted on counterfeiting charges. </p> <p>\"This will be no magic wand,\" said Fouad Massoum, the conference chairman. \"We cannot solve all of Iraq's problems in three days, but we have to start somewhere.\"</p> <p><b>Who turned up - and who didn't</b></p> <p><b> Present:</b> </p> <p><b><b>\u00b7</b> </b>Iraq's main ethnic groups: Arabs, Kurds and Turkomen </p> <p><b><b>\u00b7</b></b> Main religious groups, including Sunni, Shia, Yezidi, Christian, Shabbak, Sabeans </p> <p><b><b>\u00b7</b></b> Representatives from the country's 18 provinces. </p> <p><b><b>\u00b7</b></b> Iraq's main political parties: Dawa, Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq (both Shia), Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, Iraqi Communist party, Kurdistan Democratic party, Iraqi Islamic Party. </p> <p><b><b>\u00b7</b></b> Civil society activists, including doctors, judges, lawyers, and teachers </p> <p><b><b>\u00b7</b></b> Tribal representatives </p> <p><b> Absent:</b> </p> <p><b><b>\u00b7</b></b> The movement of the rebel Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr.

  "Gunbattles claimed 27 lives in Afghanistan at the weekend as preparations continued for October's presidential election. <p>At least 21 fighters died during battles featuring tanks and artillery between militias of the powerful governor Ismail Khan and local rivals in the western province of Herat. Fighting was quelled by US-trained Afghan army troops yesterday afternoon. </p> <p>To the south Taliban insurgents attacked an outpost 40 miles from Kandahar in the early hours, killing six government soldiers. </p> <p>The violence highlighted security fears for the historic October 9 poll, which pits the interim president, Hamid Karzai, against 22 opponents. He is widely expected to win. </p> <p>Afghans appear to have embraced the poll. By the time the voters' roll closed yesterday almost 10 million had registered, exceeding most estimates. A UN spokesman hailed the figure as a sign of enthusiasm for democracy, but analysts fear it could signal double-voting or other forms of vote rigging. </p> <p>Violence and intimidation, however, pose the greatest threat to the polls. A string of bombings and attacks have so far claimed the lives of 30 election workers and voters.</p>",
  "<b>New York Post</b> <br> Editorial, August 13   \"It must have been a personally anguishing experience [on Thursday] for James McGreevey - resigning as governor of New Jersey after admitting that he is gay and that he had engaged in 'an adulterous relationship'. <p>Indeed, his decision to quit came amid reports that he faced a sexual harassment lawsuit from the man reported to be his longtime 'very good friend' and former homeland security chief, Golan Cipel. Mr Cipel was a controversial appointment from the start. The Israeli national isn't an American citizen and had no prior experience in anti-terrorism.</p> <p>\"New Jerseyans - indeed, all Americans - have a right to be outraged at the job Mr McGreevey chose for Mr Cipel. Placing someone so plainly unqualified in such a critical position, post-9/11, is simply unacceptable.\" </p> <p><b>Boston Herald</b><br> Editorial, August 14  \"Even in departing, Mr McGreevey is having it all his way.

On Thursday, the California supreme court invalidated 4,000 same-sex marriages performed by the city of San Francisco, but gay-marriage advocates hope that this is a temporary setback.</p> <p>\"The McGreevey debacle suggests why all Americans have a stake in universalising marriage. The greatest promise of same-sex marriage is its potential to reinforce the message that marriage is the gold standard best when love, sex and marriage go together.

  "Why is a 60-year-old millionaire in shirt and slacks touring America, saluting plump matrons with banners and teenagers waving flags? <p>Because he's John Kerry and, almost four decades after four or so months of very active military service, he's running for president. No, wait. Saluting for president. It's an incongruous and depressing spectacle. </p> <p>There is, in a muted way, quite a lot to be said for Kerry. Watch him answering questions from black journalists in Washington last week and see how he handles the issues well: he's good at thoughtful policy discussion. </p> <p>His long years in the Senate haven't been wasted. He understands defence and intelligence. Maybe he still looks curiously lumpen on the stump - half Woody from Toy Story, half Van Heflin in Shane - but his Boston convention speech was decently eloquent. And he gave his daughter's hamster the kiss of life. </p> <p>In sum, Kerry and John Edwards make a balanced team - mixed gravitas and grin - which, nationally, is probably just ahead of Bush and Cheney - mixed gawp and grizzle - and doing rather better than that in a majority of the battleground states where November's election will be won and lost. </p> <p>So far, so promising. But somehow you feel that the real contest isn't joined yet - and meanwhile Kerry keeps on saluting, a nervous tic. </p> <p>We know why he does it. Some bright spark, long ago on the primary campaign trail, decided that Kerry's brief, old moment of heroism in a war Americans in general (and Democrats in particular) like to forget, could be vamped point-counterpoint against George Bush's more mysterious record flying Texan National Guard jets in Alabama. But the point, not to mention the counterpoint, is pretty exhausted now. </p> <p>It isn't just the predictable emergence of a bunch of well-funded Vietnam veterans who buy TV commercial time to defecate on his record (even if, as it seems, they weren't exactly on the spot when the waste matter hit the fan). </p> <p>It is the way the whole nature of the debate is cramped and confined by its pseudo-military posturing. In theory, Kerry's little C-in-C routine makes him a natural White House adversary of Osama, Saddam and menacing visitors from outer space. (Alien versus Predator is on general US release this week.) In practice, it makes him as one-dimensional as an empty parade ground. </p> <p>His ramrod back and carving fingers say he should be barking orders. But, when his lips move, they mouth careful clauses and prudent caveats. </p> <p>He's uneasy playing simple in a complex world - and, properly orchestrated, that could be a real strength. Who needs another candidate flubbing his script and playing stupid? But when mouth and military two-step don't match, the result is painfully obvious. \"Flip-flop!\" cry George W and the rest. He engages brain and changes his mind! Who on earth can salute such indecision? </p> <p>Some of the Bush charges are asinine. The president calls Kerry a slacker, for instance - probably in yet another ex cathedra vacation statement from Midland, Texas. But flip-floppery is a more resonant slur. </p> <p>Anyone who sits in the Senate has his party line to worry about - and inconsistency comes as inevitably as politics. A politician with a long record has to be vulnerable to easy hits, and can perhaps explain and defuse them. But a war hero with a saluting twitch sets himself up as something different, something above politics. </p> <p>Kerry is stuck now with a hollow, unhelpful role - mired in ancient controversy, doomed to renounce nuances or balances. </p> <p>Would he (the Michael Howard memorial gaffe) have gone to war in Iraq knowing that it (like the duff intelligence it was based on) clearly wasn't worth it. An answer that both Bush and Blair might privately echo. </p> <p>But Kerry can't do hypotheticals or hindsight. He has to be straight and clear. So, yes, he would have moved to oust Saddam. He'd have done, alas, just what the president did. </p> <p>And thus the me-too litany grows. Is America really embarked on a \"war\" against terror - as opposed to the pursuit of a particularly malign agglomeration of terrorists? It's a vital distinction, but Commander Kerry can't make it. D</p> <p>on't we hear rather too much about service nobility and rather too little about Abu Ghraib? Kerry, the super vet, is hamstrung there, too. Come to think of it, where is Osama bin Laden - or even Mullah Omar? The commander can't go there either. He'd be talking military failure, not military triumph. </p> <p>He could make hay with the Bush record day after day. Flip-flop? First flatten Najaf, then pick it up and dust it down. He could ridicule the Bush absurdity of bringing \"democracy and freedom\" to the Muslim world which doesn't appear to include Saudi Arabia. </p> <p>He could laugh out loud when Bush calls Afghanistan a \"rising democracy\" - as opposed to the rising star of global heroin production. </p> <p>But, yet again, he's hobbled. He wants the troops home early. He's on their side against the White House and an indeterminate schedule which sees the boys sweating it out in Baghdad for ever. </p> <p>To achieve his early exit, though, he needs more help from more allies - which means he can't be nasty to anyone. A democratic \"coalition of the willing\" which includes Turkmenistan is a joke beyond sickness. A \"new mood of cooperation\" means finally proving less feeble, less flip-floppy than Bush has proved over Israel. It means telling General Sharon where he gets off and what to with his wall. </p> <p>A statesman could begin to lay out that ground. An ordinary, articulate politician could begin to explain why change is necessary. </p> <p>Kerry direly needs such change. It is why he is necessary. But not while he's giving that damned salute, not while the Mekong still flows straight through the purple heart of his campaign. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:p.preston@theguardian.com\">p.preston@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "As a young man, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez discovered that his great-grandfather was a renowned guerrilla fighter, though he had been brought up to believe he was a criminal. Ch\u00e1vez set off to explore the area around the Colombian border where he had fought, with the idea of writing his ancestor's history. With his camera, tape recorder and research materials, the Colombian military took him for a spy and arrested him. After arguing for hours beneath a portrait of Simon Bolivar, the continent's 19th century liberator who tried to unite South America, Chavez pointed to the picture of the freedom fighter and appealed to his captor. Less than a century ago, he said, we would have been brothers in arms in Bolivar's army. <p>Chavez's hopes of carrying forward Bolivar's legacy rest with the people of Venezuela, voting this weekend on the future of his left-wing presidency. Like the inhabitants of the fictional Macondo in Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude , the players in Venezuela's febrile politics seem fated to continually revisit the continent's troubled past. </p> <p>And both sides, Ch\u00e1vez's left-wing presidency and an opposition representing the business interests of Venezuela's ancien r\u00e9gime, appropriate the continent's historic giants to their cause, praising or condemning, inter alia, Cuba's Fidel Castro, Nicaragua's Daniel Ortega, and Chile's Augusto Pinochet and Salvador Allende. But for Chavez, no figure looms larger than the man who tried to unite South America. </p> <p>Whether his cherished history will reassert itself in Venezuela as tragedy or farce - or as a moment of national redemption - will be decided at the ballot boxes today in a referendum on his possible 'recall' - the culmination of the opposition's attempts to depose the 50-year-old. </p> <p>The troubled six-year rule of Ch\u00e1vez ('El Commandante') has been marked by strikes, lethal demonstrations and an attempted coup. It is more than a parochial issue. Venezuela is the biggest exporter of oil to the US - ahead even of Saudi Arabia - so its political stability has profound implications in a time of soaring oil prices. </p> <p>And critical in deciding the result will be whether Venezuela sees its president as a champion of social justice against the country's elites, and an international champion of anti-globalization, or as a dictator in the making who wants to remodel the country as a second Cuba. </p> <p>The opposition, including most of the country's media, whose proprietors were parties to the attempted coup, line up behind the latter position. Their view is shared by the US, whose officials were implicated in the failed coup, and by those Venezuelans who have most to lose from Ch\u00e1vez's ambitious plans for social reform. </p> <p>By contrast, international support for Hugo Ch\u00e1vez comes from those who in a previous era spoke for the Sandanistas and against Chile's Pinochet, among them British writers and film-makers Harold Pinter, Eric Hobsbawm, Ken Loach and Mike Hodges, as well as new campaigners for social justice, including the Canadian writer Naomi Klein. </p> <p>The way in which the battle-lines have been drawn have as much to do with Ch\u00e1vez's position as a figurehead of opposition to US policy in the region (he called George W Bush an 'asshole') as with his domestic policies. In recent days, Ch\u00e1vez has insisted that today's referendum, far from being simply a Venezuelan issue, is a battle against US imperialism. </p> <p>Which leaves the question: who is the real Ch\u00e1vez? Even the sympathetic Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez struggled to answer this when he interviewed Ch\u00e1vez shortly after his election in 1998. He concluded that he had the potential to fulfil both the role ascribed to him by friends and that attributed to him by his enemies. </p> <p>In his article, The Enigma of the Two Ch\u00e1vezes , Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez remarked that he felt he had been speaking to two different men: 'One a self-styled visionary who had been granted the opportunity to save his country. The other... an illusionist, who might pass into history as just another despot.' </p> <p>Charismatic Ch\u00e1vez has deliberately identified himself with two of South America's most powerful historical icons: Bolivar, for whom he named his social revolution, and Fidel Castro, his autocratic mentor for whom he has declared admiration and to whom he is supplying Venezuelan oil. And his use of Venezuela's oil - and the revenues from it - are, in large measure, the reason Mr Ch\u00e1vez is such a bogeyman for the US and Venezuelan opposition. His threat to cut oil supplies if the US continued 'meddling' in Latin America did not go down well in Washington. </p> <p>Sitting on the world's fifth largest reserves of oil, Venezuela supplies 13 per cent of US needs. Ch\u00e1vez rose to power on the back of his allegations that the country's wealth was being squandered by the country's corrupt elites. </p> <p>His rhetoric, combined with his dark mestizo looks, provincial accent, modest background and populist persona (including a passion for baseball), galvanised his country's massive underclass against the existing political order, and delivered him the biggest majority in the history of Venezuela's democracy. </p> <p>When Ch\u00e1vez quickly made good on his threats against the management of the state-owned oil company Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela it triggered the country's rolling political crisis that at one stage saw all oil exports halted. </p> <p>A prolonged oil strike in 2002 after he tried to move against Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela's management was followed by a lock-out that in turn opened the way for Ch\u00e1vez to achieve some of his political ends. He fired thousands of the sector's most privileged employees and redirected millions in revenues to his pet projects, including funding Venezuela's welcome to 13,000 Cuban doctors. </p> <p>The battle provoked demonstrations and violence in Caracas leading in April 2002 to 17 deaths and hundreds injured when pro-government and opposition gunmen each fired on unarmed demonstrators. A short-lived 'media-military coup d'\u00e9tat' on 12 April put Chavez out of office for two days. Venezuela's poor took the streets and secured his return. </p> <p>By 2003, strikes, demonstrations and a coup having failed to remove him, the opposition - with US encouragement - began organising a 'recall' petition for a referendum on his presidency, a mechanism ironically only possible as a result of Ch\u00e1vez's constitutional reforms. </p> <p>The opposition's retreat from street confrontation has been matched by a kind of truce with the US which, with the high oil price, a weakening economy and an election in the autumn, has also pulled back from further conflict with Ch\u00e1vez. </p> <p>It is hardly surprising that Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez (an invited international observer for today's referendum) found Chavez a paradox. Born in 1954 and brought up by impoverished teacher parents, the young Ch\u00e1vez was, by the age of nine, supplementing the family income by selling fruit and sweets on the streets. A talented musician, artist and sportsman as a youth, a career in the military was not his first choice, but he settled on it when a friend told him it could be a route to professional baseball. </p> <p>By the early 1990s, Ch\u00e1vez, by then a colonel, was one of the founders of the clandestine Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement, which launched a failed military coup against President Carlos Andr\u00e9s P\u00e9rez over unpopular austerity measures. He spent two years in jail but, pardoned and released, relaunched his group as the democratic Movement for the Fifth Republic. </p> <p>On the 'visionary' side of the balance sheet, Ch\u00e1vez himself lists his achievements since his election largely in terms of social justice. He claims to have reduced infant mortality by 30 per cent, improved child vaccination and access to health services and hired thousands of new teachers on higher salaries while giving land to more than a million landless or largely landless agrarian poor. </p> <p>The counterpoint to Ch\u00e1vez's campaign for social justice for the poor, has been an attack on the ingrained privileges of Venezuela's old elites. </p> <p>The opposition, and their sometime US backers, believe that this demonstrates his 'Jacobin tendencies'. Faced with institutions stacked with opponents - including the judiciary, military and congress - Ch\u00e1vez first came into conflict with Venezuela's business community in 1999 when he passed a series of new laws to apply his left-leaning economic policy. </p> <p>He also organised referendums to re-write the country's constitution, under a new Constitutional Assembly opponents say is packed with his supporters and has been allowed to hijack functions of the legislature. Ch\u00e1vez, too, has done little to reassure the 20 per cent or so of undecided voters, remarking that while his 'revolution is peaceful', it is also armed. </p> <p>This, perhaps, is the greatest unresolved mystery about Ch\u00e1vez. For, while the opposition accuses Ch\u00e1vistas of harassment, it is also true that for all their claims of Ch\u00e1vez's brutality, death squads do not roam Venezuela's countryside, nor are its jails full of political prisoners. </p> <p>Evidence of creeping authoritarianism is more subtle. From the Supreme Court to elements of the security forces that supported his enemies in the events leading up to the abortive coup, Ch\u00e1vez has moved to bring more of the state under his direct control. </p> <p>For now, though, Ch\u00e1vez and Venezuela will have to wait for the outcome of a referendum whose result remains too difficult to call. And to see whether Ch\u00e1vez can survive to bring about the promise of his democratic transformation of Venezuelan society - or whether, ironically, like Bolivar himself, his will be a flawed destiny that ends with dictatorship and eventual defeat. </p> <p><b> Hugo Ch\u00e1vez</b> </p> <p> <b> DoB:</b> 28 July, 1954 (Sabaneta, Barinas) </p> <p><b> Family: </b> Son of schoolteachers, he is married and has five children (three sons and two daughters) </p> <p><b> Education:</b> A degree in engineering from Venezuela's Military Academy </p> <p><b> Likes:</b> Baseball, Fidel Castro</p>",
  "<p><strong>You often advise people to keep low on carbohydrates. Are rye crispbreads any better than bread in terms of carbs?</strong><br>Betty Harris, London N1 </p> <p>Grain-based carbohydrates tend to give a relatively brisk and considerable release of sugar into the bloodstream, which in turn can cause surges in insulin (excesses of which increase the risk of several health issues, including weight gain, type 2 diabetes and heart disease). </p> <p>The extent of blood-sugar release from a food can be measured and is expressed as its glycaemic index. In the glycaemic index scale, glucose is assigned an arbitrary value of 100. Bread, including wholemeal, generally has glycaemic indices of about 70 and above (high). Rye crispbreads have glycaemic indices around the mid-60s, which means they are perhaps slightly better than bread, but far from ideal, with regard to their effect on blood sugar and insulin levels. However, it is not just a food's glycaemic index, but also how much of it is eaten.

  "<p><strong>Free World: Why a Crisis of the West Reveals an Opportunity of our Times</strong><br>by Timothy Garton Ash<br>Allen Lane \u00a317.99, pp320</p> <p>Timothy Garton Ash is an optimist. The transatlantic relationship is in crisis, with diplomats and policy wonks on both sides of the Atlantic fearing that the intensive post-Iraq marriage counselling will fail. Robert Kagan, the most articulate of America's neocons, has gone so far as to declare that we live on different planets - Americans from Mars and Europeans from Venus, a beguiling thesis that some have seemed determined to turn into a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p> <p>Garton Ash doesn't buy it. Well established as Britain's leading thinker on contemporary European affairs (albeit in a sadly under-crowded field), he is able to bring a wider-angled lens to these familiar, entrenched controversies. Here, conversations with both statesman and citizens across Europe and North America see him challenge most of the generalisations that dominate current debate.</p> <p>For Garton Ash, both Europe and America inevitably contradict themselves - because both contain multitudes. Garton Ash wants not just a renewal of vows but a new shared mission. He also wants to see the end of 'the West' but only when the billion of us who live in free societies create a new 'post-West' by spreading security and freedom globally. He thus thinks the current transatlantic rift a rather parochial spat, arguing that Europeans may have only another two decades in which they can hope to play a shaping role in global affairs while the scope and limits of America's military power have also become clearer in postwar Iraq.</p> <p>Still, starting from here will be difficult. The book's critique of the Bush administration is a familiar one, though the author is always at pains to distinguish this from anti-Americanism. Indeed, there is a growing awareness within a highly polarised United States of the self-defeating damage done to America's 'soft power' (the worldwide appeal of the Statue of Liberty and its open and prosperous society and the good life). The mistakes America made following 11 September 2001 wasted much of the global sympathy the attacks had brought it.</p> <p>Yet Garton Ash is no less sceptical about the grandstanding of European statesmen, when the EU's aspirations to an effective foreign policy remain largely rhetorical. He believes that Blair made a major blunder over Iraq but is fundamentally sympathetic to the project of seeking to 'bridge' the Atlantic, arguing that much of the new Europe finds it as impossible as Britain does to choose between loyalty to Europe and America.</p> <p>Garton Ash believes we can find causes for optimism if our responses to the current international crisis draw as much on Europe's '9/11 of hope' (the fall of the Berlin Wall on 9 November 1989) as America's 9/11. Just as stereotypes and mutual antagonism saw divisions over Iraq deepen, a virtuous spiral could make his free world possible, Garton Ash suggests. A fully committed European Britain could make a Franco-British-German rapprochement possible, creating a more outward-looking Europe.</p> <p>Such a Europe could encourage a better America to believe that effective multilateral institutions are possible, this being the only way that emerging powers such as China might co-operate on global warming and so on. These debates are interdependent but, of course, this seems a rather long-odds accumulator bet.</p> <p>Britain's deep ambivalence about the European Union and its new constitution and the reaction of Jacques Chirac to the new Europe of 25 - suggesting that ex-Iron Curtain countries might best keep quiet in the EU - hardly augur well.</p> <p>Garton Ash does not just make an eloquent appeal to the better America and the better Europe. He also insists, unfashionably, on our ability as citizens to exert pressure for change. Here is where his decades talking to Czechs, Poles and Hungarians are most telling. Sometimes, the citizens' action proposed is direct and tangible: we should pressure governments to meet the much-neglected target to increase aid to 0.7 per cent of GDP and also give 1 per cent of our personal incomes to support development. But how citizens will make their voices count for more in a constructive way, especially when the key decisions are taken in labyrinth of multilateral international institutions, is less clear.</p> <p>Garton Ash's 'free world' project is unfashionably optimistic, too, despite the spread and entrenchment of democracy over the decades from 1945 to 1975 to 1989 and beyond. Europe's liberal left, despite its Enlightenment roots, balks from such language, for fear of being associated with an aggressive neocon project. Yet Europe's left risks becoming a 'status quo' force if it tries to turn an effective critique of the botched Iraq intervention into an essentially conservative argument which accepts the premise of a 'clash of civilisations' and the belief that the Arabs are incapable of democracy.</p> <p>The debate about intervention in failed states has become muddied by Iraq, but it would be a mistake to forget the distance travelled over the 1990s because of the failures to intervene in Rwanda or, for too long, in Bosnia, because these 'ancient ethnic hatreds' were none of our business. Whether over the current genocide in Sudan or elsewhere, these debates will soon return. But we may be considerably further from finding an effective response to them.</p> <p>Garton Ash rightly sees a victory for John Kerry in America's presidential election this November as vital to any fresh start. But a Kerry victory would also re-expose the faultlines of many of the most important and unresolved debates of the past decade. If Europeans could respond to the current crisis in the spirit of this book, it might do something to tilt the balance towards the better America we need. And in asserting the importance of those of us in democratic societies seeking to be authors of our own fate, Garton Ash has produced a humane, democratic manifesto for our times. It is worth recalling the lesson of the fall of the Berlin Wall - politics sometimes needs to be the art of the impossible, too.</p>",
  "<p>A new season brought a familiar old story from Manchester City, who squandered a first-half lead and a position of apparent comfort to draw with Fulham. A year into occupancy of the City of Manchester Stadium, where they won just five times in the league last season, and City are showing few signs of improving on that dismal record. </p> <p>Received wisdom suggests that a solid start to the season is vital for a City team that capitulated in alarming fashion in the second two-thirds of the last campaign, crucial not only for the team's fragile morale but also for the future of manager Kevin Keegan. </p> <p>Certainly, the opening exchanges of the new term augured well, even if the two key performers in some promising attacking play from City were, up to kick-off at least, the subject of intense transfer speculation. </p> <p>Shaun Wright-Phillips, who is widely expected to win his first England cap in the midweek friendly against Ukraine, had been consistently linked in the summer with Liverpool and Tottenham, before the versatile midfielder signed a new four-year contract with City yesterday. </p> <p>Within two minutes of kick-off, Wright-Phillips had sped, in exhilarating fashion, from the edge of his own area to that of Fulham's, crossing superbly for Nicolas Anelka, who was only denied by Moritz Volz's covering header. </p> <p>Anelka, the itinerant Frenchman whose natural ability is exceeded only by his wanderlust, is the second City player whose future is in the spotlight, alleged moves back to his homeland having been given a regular airing throughout the close season. </p> <p>Yet he, like Wright-Phillips, remains hugely popular among City fans, who saw him come close on a couple of occasions, most notably when he just failed to connect with Claudio Reyna's 13th-minute cross. Reyna was the other influential figure in City's dominant opening, his free-kick soon after finding Wright-Phillips on the edge of the area for a wayward volley. </p> <p>However, when the opening goal arrived it was courtesy of Robbie Fowler, one of City's more anonymous performers to that point, who produced a precise 28th-minute finish after Antoine Sibierski had helped on a long throw-in from Danny Mills. Fowler, whose City career to date has been far from fruitful, scored with a clever, over-the-shoulder lob from 15 yards for a goal that was no more than the Blues deserved. </p> <p>With David James a virtual first-half spectator against a toothless Fulham, the Anelka/Wright-Phillips combination almost worked again just after the half-hour, the latter's shot kept out by Edwin van der Sar with Fowler close to netting the rebound. </p> <p>It promised to get better for City, Anelka narrowly missing the target from the edge of the area just before the break, Wright-Phillips heading just wide from Sibierski's cross just after it. But City would not be City without the inherent ability to self-destruct and, sure enough, Fulham's first attack of note proved the point. </p> <p>There should have been little danger posed from Claus Jensen's 56th-minute cross into the area, accurate as it was, but City's new signing Danny Mills inexplicably stood off Collins John, allowing the Liberian to control the ball and score, right-footed, from 15 yards. </p> <p>James would be required to make one save of importance, keeping out Jensen's 80th-minute shot to prevent City from complete disaster, but the home team's profligacy in front of goal will presumably have given Keegan as much concern as their inadequacy in defence. </p> <p>Van der Sar made a series of impressive saves to prevent City scoring again, first tipping over a Reyna shot from just inside the area, then saving a Sibierski header, denying a deflected shot from his own team-mate Jensen and enjoying a moment of fortune as Sibierski's shot whistled past his goal. </p> <p><strong> Man of the Match</strong> </p> <p><strong> Shaun Wright-Phillips</strong> The expected announcement that the youngster has signed a new four-year contract with City will come as a major fillip for the club and frustrate Tottenham and Liverpool, two of the clubs known to be among his suitors. Wright-Phillips' energy, intuitive play and pace more than make up for his lack of inches as he drove City on. </p> <p>You can mail the Observer direct at <a href=\"mailto:sport@observer.co.uk\">sport@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "If John Kerry wins the US presidency, he will find himself in the same plight as Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon when they took office. Each inherited another man's war. Each prosecuted that war, Johnson reluctantly, Nixon because he thought he could do better. Both failed and were destroyed by the war. <p>Johnson dreaded that this would happen. He told his press secretary, Bill Moyers: 'I feel like a hitchhiker caught in a hailstorm on a Texas highway. I can't run. I can't hide. And I can't make it stop.' </p> <p>The murdered Kennedy's foreign policy advisers told him that if he didn't press on with the war, 'Asian communism' would conquer one non-Western state after another - dominos tumbling. So did practically everyone else in the Washington policy community. It was one of those things 'everybody knew'. </p> <p>Johnson was a populist economic and racial-justice reformer. He knew nothing of south-east Asia. He knew that if he prosecuted the war, he 'would lose everything at home'. If he did not, he 'would be seen as a coward and my nation would be seen as an appeaser, and we would both find it impossible to accomplish anything for anybody anywhere'. Kerry expresses no such doubts. He apparently accepts what 'everyone knows' in Washington today, as in London, that 'failure in Iraq is not an option'. </p> <p>This is true. Failure is no longer an option because it has already been assured by choices already made by the Bush administration. The questions that remain are failure's timing and the gravity of its consequences. The principal purpose of the invasion was to turn Iraq into Washington's strategic anchor in the Middle East, with permanent US military bases there and an assured American role in its economy and oil industry. </p> <p>The countries that previously played this strategic role were the Shah's government in Iran during the 1960s and 1970s and Saudi Arabia following the Gulf War. They provide inauspicious precedents. The Shah's government was overturned by the same nationalist and religious forces that motivate the Iraq insurrection today. The identical forces, at work within elite groups in Saudi Arabia, were responsible for Osama bin Laden's creation of al-Qaeda. </p> <p>John Kerry supported the invasion of Iraq. He says that he still does. His reproach to George W Bush is that he, Kerry, could have done it better. He would have won the support of all the allies and of the international community. If elected, he promises to 'put a deal together' with those allies that would allow 'a significant, enormous reduction' of US troops in Iraq by the end of his first term, that is, by four years from now. </p> <p>Subsequently realising that this is not quite what the electorate wants to hear, he promised to withdraw troops within a year, a correction undermining the plausibility of both promises, contributing to his difficulty in clarifying where he actually stands. </p> <p>None the less, he seems confident that if he is President, other countries will send troops to fight the insurgency, replacing Americans. He does not explain why they should wish to do so. Last week, Polish and Ukrainian authorities noted that their troops, engaged by militants of Muqtada al-Sadr's Mahdi army, had been sent to Iraq as peacekeepers, not to fight, and that their existing commitments will soon be up. </p> <p>When Nixon campaigned for the presidency in 1968, during the Vietnam war, he said, like Kerry, that he knew how to win. His plan was to emulate Dwight Eisenhower, whose Vice-President Nixon had been during the war in Korea. He would threaten nuclear war. When Eisenhower took office in January 1953, he caused a message to be conveyed to Beijing and Pyongyang, warning that he would 'carry on the war in new ways never yet tried in Korea'. In July, an armistice was agreed, effectively partitioning Korea along the 38th parallel, as it remains today. </p> <p>When Nixon became President in 1969, the notion of atomic attack on North Vietnam had already been bruited in limited Washington circles, but judged an unprofitable option. He none the less transmitted a threat of 'massive retaliation' to Hanoi, to no effect. He subsequently ordered bombing attacks that eventually became the heaviest campaign of conventional aerial bombing in the history of warfare. The Vietnamese communists were unmoved. </p> <p>The Vietnam war ended with an ignominious American withdrawal, following an agreement with Hanoi signed in 1973. Two-and-a-half years after that, Saigon fell to communist forces, with American officials scrambling on to helicopters from the embassy rooftop. </p> <p>Nixon, however, had possessed an option in 1969 that he lacked the courage to choose. He had always said he admired Charles de Gaulle. De Gaulle, when returned to power in 1958, at a moment of extreme crisis in France's war to defeat Algerian insurgents and to keep Algeria French, recognised that the war was futile, even if the insurrection itself might temporarily be defeated. </p> <p>He cut France's losses. Defying military mutiny, despite significant resistance from French public opinion, and facing assassination attempts and a terrorist campaign directed against him and his government, de Gaulle negotiated Algerian independence. It was an act of cold-blooded courage and realism. </p> <p>It did not leave France revealed as 'a pitiful, helpless giant', as Nixon said would be the case if the United States left Vietnam. It strengthened France, freeing it to deal with the real issues of political and economic reform. If John Kerry is elected President, he will have the de Gaulle option. He will have a window lasting a few months during which he could reverse US policy and expect, provisionally, to carry public opinion with him. </p> <p>Kerry could set a general timetable for coalition troop withdrawals, begin them, terminate the construction of permanent American bases now going on and reaffirm respect for Iraq's sovereign authority over its national economy, its industry and the disposition of its energy resources. </p> <p>He could offer new support and urge international engagement in new efforts by the traditional religious and tribal leadership and existing political forces to re-establish the representative political institutions that existed in Iraq between independence in 1932 and the series of military and Baath party coups that began in 1958. </p> <p>The conventional wisdom in Washington and London is that political disorder and communal struggle would actually follow, leading to chaos, Iraq becoming 'a breeding ground for terrorism'. Once again, this is irrelevant. Iraq already is a breeding ground for terrorism and is nearing chaos under the occupation. </p> <p>It is obvious that continued military occupation worsens the situation: it provokes resistance and disorder. In any case, the ultimate responsibility for what happens in Iraq lies with the Iraqis, if they are let alone. This is what they have insistently been saying all along. </p> <p>The intervention in Iraq is the latest in a 50-year series of American politico-military interventions into the internal affairs of non-Western countries, none of which has been a success. Most were failures. The consequence of failure in Vietnam unseated the Johnson and Nixon administrations. Revolution in Iran and defeat in Lebanon in 1983 seriously damaged the Carter and Reagan administrations. This year, Iraq may defeat George W Bush. </p> <p>Why should John Kerry wish to be next? But on present evidence, this is likely to become the case. </p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>William Pfaff is the author of several books on American foreign policy, most recently Fear, Anger and Failure: A Chronicle of the Bush Administration's War against Terror<br> </p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>Andrew Rawnsley is away</p>",
  "American Indians have been massacred, moved and marginalised for centuries. Yet now, with the prospect of a knife-edge presidential election, they are discovering they suddenly wield considerable political clout. <p>For the first time, native Americans living in large numbers in several vital battleground states are being aggressively wooed by both big parties. 'Those states could hold the key to the whole election,' said leading pollster John Zogby. </p> <p>Democratic challenger John Kerry attended the closing ceremony of a pow-wow of the Zuni and Navajo tribes last week in the town of Gallup, New Mexico. An Indian elder waved a fan of feathers over Kerry's head as he sat with his wife, Teresa, in front of about 4,000 Indians. </p> <p>The ceremony, which was closed to photographers because of its sacred place in Indian religious beliefs, came at the end of an extensive tour of reservations by the Democrat contender. Kerry made a pitch for their votes by speaking out against the poverty on most reservations. 'There's a feeling that the people here haven't been respected,' he said in Gallup. </p> <p>The Democrats are producing campaign literature in tribal languages. Members of the Tohono O'odham tribe sang the national anthem at the Democrats' national convention. </p> <p>Arizona's Democrat governor, Janet Napolitano, held a special party there for native American tribes, reflecting her belief that their votes were crucial in her own 2002 election victory in the state. </p> <p>In Arizona, more than 300,000 native Americans make up almost 6 per cent of the population. In New Mexico, the figure is 10 per cent - and in 2000 Bush lost the state by just 366 votes. Wisconsin, Washington, Oklahoma and North and South Dakota also have large Indian populations - Wisconsin was won by Al Gore in 2000 by less than 1 per cent. </p> <p>The Republican party has also launched an initiative to win over the usually sceptical native American voters. Most usually vote Democrat, but a growing number are Republican sympathisers, said a spokesman for the National Congress of American Indians. 'It really is changing rapidly. There is a rising Republican constituency.' </p> <p>Republican campaigners have produced radio adverts in the Navajo language for the first time . In Arizona, various tribes recently helped Republicans to win local elections. Health Secretary Tommy Thompson visited the same Navajo reservation as Kerry last July as part of a drive against the alcoholism and diabetes which plague its resi dents. Experts believe these visits are vital. 'Marginalised groups respond very well. Don't underestimate the \"He came to my store\" or \"He came to my living room\" factor,' said Zogby. </p> <p>But besides the need to get out every vote in the swing states, another factor is at play: money. Some tribes have benefited hugely from cash from casinos built on their land. The flood of money from gambling has made some of them power players in elections, where cash is often the key to success. In last year's California governorship poll, Indian tribes donated $11 million (\u00a36m) of the $65m spent by the candidates. </p> <p>Some of the biggest Indian political donors give cash to Republican causes, but Zogby said: 'They are major financial players for Republicans in several states, but the native Americans' votes still generally go to the Democrats.'</p>",
  "President George Bush will announce tomorrow that the US military will pull up to 100,000 troops out of Europe and Asia in the biggest redeployment since the end of the Cold War. <p>The plan will see a number of US bases in Germany closed down, and troops returned home or redeployed to Eastern Europe. </p> <p>The redeployment - first reported by The Observer in February last year in the run-up to the invasion of Iraq - will be presented by Bush as a logical response to the war on terrorism when he addresses the 2.6 million-member Veterans of Foreign Wars at its annual convention in Cincinnati. </p> <p>In February last year, however, when the proposal was first mooted, Pentagon officials presented the closure of the bases in Germany as punishment for Germany's refusal to back the war in Iraq. </p> <p>Pentagon officials, who confirmed the planned announcement in yesterday's Washington Post, said the change is necessary to adapt the nation's military to the demands of the global war on terrorism and to take advantage of new technology. </p> <p>But the planned restructuring also comes amid overstretch in a US army struggling to juggle commitments in Iraq, Afghanistan and other theatres, and has been responsible for declining morale particularly in combat units. </p> <p>According to the Post, two-thirds of the reduction will come from Europe, most of them Army soldiers in Germany, and most will be reassigned to bases in the US. </p> <p>Officials said exact details of the moves have not been finalised, but some of the troops from Germany and South Korea will be moved to Nato expansion countries in Eastern Europe. </p> <p>While Bush will emphasise the changing nature of the threat, it is clear that morale within the US military in an election year is a crucial issue as the death toll in Iraq rises. Discontent has been growing among relatives of servicemen and women, some who have barely been home between the war in Afghanistan and the war in Iraq. </p> <p>Any planned redeployment is likely to follow lengthy negotiations with the countries where the troops are stationed. At present, more than 60 per cent of the US Army - some 320,000 troops - are deployed overseas and former senior military officers claim the army is cracking under the strain. </p> <p>The rapid turnaround in deployments in units has resulted in a growing retention crisis. Already US defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld has allowed the Army to add 30,000 troops temporarily to its total to help meet the overstretch crisis, while the Pentagon has also used emergency powers to force some soldiers whose enlistments are up to stay.</p>",
  "<p>It's been Media Memorial Week in America these past few days. Remember Watergate 30 years after Nixon's fall? Remember Woodward and Bernstein, the hammers of the Washington Post who supposedly brought him down? Here they came again, back on TV as relics of past glories: Bob Woodward more chiselled and cadaverous than Robert Redford, Carl Bernstein more chubby and grizzled than Dustin Hoffman. But are they - and were they - stars or bit players? </p> <p>That's a question tackled head-on by Professor Mark Feldstein of George Washington University in the latest American Journalism Review. Feldstein used to be an investigative reporter himself and he's consulted exhaustively with the experts, including the still bur geoning tribe of Watergate historians. </p> <p>Take the sociologist Michael Schudson (author of Watergate in American Memory ): 'A mythology of the press... developed into a significant national myth, a story that independently carries on a memory of Watergate even as details about what Nixon did or did not do fade away. This is a myth of David and Goliath, of powerless individuals overturning an institution of overwhelming might. The press, truth its only weapon, saves the day.' </p> <p>Take Stanley Kutler (author of The Wars of Watergate). 'As more documentary materials are released, the media's role... diminishes in scope and importance. Television and newspapers publicised the story and, perhaps, even encouraged more diligent investigation. But, as Watergate unfolded from 1972 to 1974, media revelations of crimes and political misdeeds repeated what was already known to properly constituted investigative authorities. In short, carefully timed leaks, not media investigations, provided the first news.' </p> <p>Take former Watergate prosecutor Seymour Glanzer: 'Woodward and Bernstein followed in our wake. The idea that they were this great investigative team was a bunch of baloney.' Glanzer be lieves that an official in the FBI's Washington field office leaked details of the Watergate probe to other reporters besides Woodward and Bernstein, but that only the Post published them early on because of its larger 'struggle with the White House'. </p> <p>Take David Greenberg, author of a new book Nixon's Shadow: 'It was unclear at first whether the FBI would pursue crimes beyond the break-in itself. If the Post hadn't kept Watergate alive, it's not certain that the bureau, or the Senate, would have kept digging. Woodward and Bernstein's work shaped the way Watergate unfolded.' </p> <p>Take any number of academics and contemporaries of Woodward and Bernstein, still arguing furiously away. Do the Post's tigerish twosome take all of the laurels? By no means. Other reporters - including the still indestructible Sy Hersh, scourge of Abu Ghraib - emerge just as influentially. But the Post's old editor, Ben Bradlee, certainly returns to take a bow. </p> <p>He published some 220 Watergate stories in the first six months of the affair, many of them on the front page, whilst others trod far more cautiously, going on catatonically. Stanley Kutler looks in detail at the 'almost nonexistent' media coverage that took place long after the break-in, and concludes that for months 'fewer than 15 of the more than 430 reporters in Washington worked exclusively on Watergate'. </p> <p>Did Woodward, Bernstein and Bradlee (in the words of Nixon's former aide, John Dean) 'do just enough to keep the story alive' by giving 'legitimacy to those [in the government] who were investigating the scandal?' That isn't Hollywood glory, but it's still a kind of triumph. </p> <p>Whatever you think, though, however you weigh the testimony, this wasn't the Redford-Hoffman movie legend made flesh. This was an utterly complex collection of FBI good guys, outraged public officials, dogged prosecutors and individual journalists banging at the doors of the White House. </p> <p>You may not read that too often. It doesn't fit the investigative script. It isn't what new generations of journalists have come to believe. But maybe that doesn't matter in the end - for, as Feldstein wryly concludes, 'Watergate's media mythology lingers... not because it is true, but because we want it to be true.' </p> <p><strong>Levin, a candid friend whose words rang out daily</strong></p> <p>One desperate cruelty of Alzheimer's is that not only its victims forget. The years of silence bring a deeper distancing. </p> <p>That may not always be fatal to reputations if, say, you're a politician: a decade of suffering surely added lustre to Ronald Reagan's stature because time drained away the bile of real politics. But daily journalists who stop writing are in a far different situation. The talent that made them ceases to speak, and so do they. A new audience knows little of their work. It is as though they had ceased to exist.</p> <p>Bernard Levin - who died last week - was more, much more, than the TV goad of an interviewer-cum-controversialist you glimpsed in the old clips. He was a wonderfully acid television critic for the Guardian , a scabrous political commentator for the Spectator , a thunderous presence in the Times . Yet I always relished Levin most for his middle years, the sixties, he spent on the Daily Mail - often writing a 600-or-so word column day after day.</p> <p>Daily columnists are a virtually extinct 21st-century breed. (The Mirror 's attempt to resuscitate Cassan dra dolefully shows us why; just one more voice lost in a cacophony.) But Levin - his prose constrained yet brutally eloquent, his range as wide as the news - showed what could be done, and what might be done again.</p> <p>The few books he wrote don't do him real justice. The columns fade inevitably. But, morning after morning, with a style that reminded you of Thomas Nash 400 years before and an unquenchable love of (and disgust for) life, he was a fascinating, fulminating force of nature - a candid friend who blew the cobwebs away.</p> <p><strong>Has the FT got Rupert foxed?</strong></p> <p>Would Rupert Murdoch like to own the Financial Times? David Yelland, who edited the Sun for the Foxy predator, thinks so - and few on Wall Street would disagree. Rupert would love a big business calling card (in just the same way that the brothers Barclay like the way the Telegraph puts them in the swim). But is Mr Murdoch actively pursuing the pink persuader, with real hopes of success - as Mr Yelland would also have us believe? There the yarn grows far mistier. </p> <p>To begin with, Marjorie Scardino - chief executive at Pearson - is a devout non-seller. The FT would go over her dead corporate body. And the paper's losses are coming down, from about \u00a332 million a year to \u00a320m. The bruising trek out of recession and back to profitability is under way. Why should the Pearson board throw in an historic towel just now?</p> <p>Then, however, the real difficulties begin. Some are practical. Before Ofcom, a merger or trade-off or straight sale of loss-making properties such as the Times or FT might have wriggled through regulatory nets. Ofcom and its attendant legislation makes that practically impossible. The 'public interest' requirements rule.</p> <p>Could Murdoch skirt around them by selling the Times to Dickie Desmond or some similar scion of society (as Yelland may further believe)? It's an unappealing, even humiliating, idea for a proprietor who never likes admitting defeat; but it is also hugely impractical in the tangled way of Wapping finances and Sunday Times relationships. It doesn't make any kind of sense.</p> <p>And there is one further nonsense that neither Rupert nor his former Sun king will necessarily twig. The FT, to its advertising cost, is a truly international paper (with full price British sales hovering ominously around 103,000 in July's ABC returns - as opposed to the Times's 450,000). That means it has to speak with an international voice - calm, analytical, pro-European, an alternative, liberal voice to the gruff barkings of the Wall Street Journal. Its liberalism isn't optional. It is necessary, defined by the market it serves.</p> <p>The Daily Financial Rupert for Frankfurt and Rome? Somehow that seems more puce than pink.</p> <p><strong>A little learning</strong></p> <p>Come to think of it, the FT and Murdoch conundrum might be solved another way. Peter Chernin, the CEO of News Corp and deputy supreme minder of the empire, has just let it be known that he's voting for Kerry this November. Kerry believes in education, he says - and so does News Corp. Final proof, if you like, that education is a wonderful thing.</p>"
