  "<b>Douglas Jehl</b> <br> New York Times, August 25 <p>\"For Donald Rumsfeld to resign over the prison abuses at Abu Ghraib would be a mistake, the four-member panel headed by James M Schlesinger asserted on Tuesday. But in tracing responsibility for what went wrong at Abu Ghraib, it drew a line that extended to the defence secretary's office. The panel cited what it called major failures on the part of Mr Rumsfeld and his aides in not anticipating and responding swiftly to the post-invasion insurgency in Iraq. On the eve of the Republican convention, that verdict could not have been welcome at the White House, where postwar problems in Iraq represent perhaps President George Bush's greatest political liability. </p> <p>\"The report ... represents the most explicit official indictment to date of an operation that was very much the province of Mr Rumsfeld and his top deputies.\" </p> <p><b>USA Today</b><br> Editorial, August 25 </p> <p>\"The abuses can be traced to Afghanistan, where the Pentagon decided to sidestep the [Geneva] conventions, a position that found legal support from the White House counsel Alberto Gonzales. The policy continued at Guant\u00e1namo Bay naval base in Cuba, where the US has imprisoned and interrogated hundreds of suspected terrorists. Many of the military jailers and servicemen familiar with interrogation practices there were sent to Iraq against the backdrop of Mr Bush's repeated descriptions of suspected Iraqi insurgents as 'terrorists'. Human-rights experts who have investigated the scandal say such statements could have had only one meaning to US jailers in Iraq: the Geneva conventions don't apply ... </p> <p>\"Those responsible for abusing prisoners must be held accountable. That's true for those at the bottom of the chain of command - and those at the top.\" </p> <p><b>New York Post</b><br> Editorial, August 25 </p> <p>\"The report into [Abu Ghraib] is ... sure to disappoint those Bush-bashers who hoped it would deliver Mr Rumsfeld's head on a silver platter ... </p> <p>\"Clearly, the report's findings lend weight to critics who charge that the adminis tration did not fully anticipate all the problems of postwar life in Iraq. But ... this is a different kind of war than those that have been fought previously. Higher-ups failed to act swiftly to correct a deteriorating situation - and they must be held accountable. But charges that the administration undertook a deliberate campaign of torture and abuse at Abu Ghraib - never credible to begin with - have been put to rest. Now it's time for Washington to make clear what has been done to prevent a recurrence.\" </p> <p><b>Herald</b><br> Editorial, Scotland, August 25 </p> <p>\"Mr Schlesinger went out of his way to say Mr Rumsfeld should not resign. This is hardly surprising, given the report was commissioned by Mr Rumsfeld's department and appointed to chair it was a former defence secretary. Mr Schlesinger goes only goes so far and fails to establish, or identify, where ultimate responsibility lies. The implications are none the less serious for Mr Rumsfeld ... </p> <p>\"Mr Rumsfeld issued policies that caused confusion, perhaps deliberately so that, in the event of things going wrong, the use of imprecise language would shield him from blame. With more revelations expected [in] the Fay report [published yesterday] Mr Rumsfeld and the Pentagon are not out of the woods.\" </p> <p><b>Independent</b><br> Editorial, August 25 </p> <p>\"[The Fay report] will recommend that at least 20 intelligence officers face punishment for their behaviour ... All this further undermines the claim by the Bush administration that the abuse was the work of the few 'bad apples' currently being court-martialled at a US base in Mannheim ... </p> <p>\"Whatever the show trials in Mannheim find, few will doubt that Mr Bush and Mr Rumsfeld are guilty of setting the moral climate which allowed such behaviour to take place.\" </p> <p><b>Financial Times</b><br> Editorial, August 25 </p> <p>\"The Pentagon's defence seems to rest on ignorance of what was going on inside its cell blocks. No evidence has yet been uncovered of Mr Rumsfeld or his aides ordering any misconduct. But they would appear guilty of condoning and encouraging disregard for established guidelines and laws ... </p> <p>\"This disregard became widespread after September 11 2001 and was a product of the feeling that the US had to 'take the gloves off' to fight terrorism. The Abu Ghraib scandals are the sorry result. The US cannot stoop in this way, if it is ever to conquer.\" </p> <p><b>Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung</b><br> Editorial, Germany, August 25 </p> <p>\"Those soldiers and civilians who neglected their duty of care ... have caused a serious problem which politicians may not have caused but for which they have to take responsibility. </p> <p>\"The moral credibility of the Bush administration (and America as a whole) has now almost completely melted away, and any moral justification for its Iraq policy will only reduce it further. Mr Rumsfeld - who is a 'revolutionary' in the Pentagon, not an apparatchik - and his closest colleagues will be protected until the election in November; but a second Bush administration is not likely to want them any more.\"</p>",
  "There was no \"imminent threat\" to the United States from Iraq. Then there was no strategy for building a new Iraq.\"Hubris and ideology\" ruled. Now, \"Iraq is more dangerous to the US potentially than it was at the moment we went to war\". <p>These are the reluctant judgments of one of the key US officials who participated in the highest levels of decision-making of the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA). Both interviewed by me and in a forthcoming article in Foreign Affairs journal, Larry Diamond offers from the heart of the Green Zone an unvarnished first-hand account of the unfolding strategic catastrophe. </p> <p>Diamond, a scholar at the Hoover Institution, a conservative thinktank located on the Stanford University campus, was personally recruited to serve as a senior adviser to the CPA by national security adviser Condoleezza Rice, once provost of Stanford. </p> <p>When he arrived in Baghdad, Diamond observed \"a highly centralised decision-making process. There were weighty Americans with decades of experience in the region who were not consulted or integrated into decision-making, foreign service officers up to the level of ambassadors.\" The neoconservatives in the Pentagon were in charge, and CPA head Paul Bremer \"was the agent more of the Pentagon than the state department\". The Pentagon cut out state because the neocons viewed it as \"not on board\" ideologically. </p> <p>The British were regarded as warily as was the state department. British ambassador to the United Nations Jeremy Greenstock was systematically shut out. \"In terms of the final decision-making on key issues I never saw much evidence that [the British] had the opportunity to weigh in.\" When British officials in Basra urged conducting local elections there \"they were vetoed\", Diamond told me. \"It would have helped. If the British had been listened to it might have been better. They had a history with this country.\" </p> <p>The UN was considered only useful as a rubber stamp to approve the flawed decisions. After the August 19 bombing that killed 22 UN personnel, \"the organisation felt that they suffered this trauma and for what? They were so ignored, they felt used. The combination of the risk and the trauma with the lack of impact and consultation left the organisation feeling wounded.\" But when UN representative Lakhdar Brahimi appeared this February, he negotiated the standoff between Shia leader Ayatollah Sistani and the US. </p> <p>\"The reasons there are six women in the cabinet, corrupt members were jettisoned, why the ministers are regarded as able and serious, has a lot to do with the UN team,\" said Diamond. \"It's indicative of what we could have accomplished. </p> <p>\"There are so many bungled elements. We haven't had a strategy for the beginning for dealing with Moqtada al-Sadr. We were flying blind from the start. The result was we didn't neutralise him early on.\" </p> <p>In Falluja, after the murder of four American contractors, the US military pounded the city and withdrew. \"We now have a terrorist base in Falluja. The Bush administration looked at the political cost, at what would have been necessary to destroy this terrorist haven. A country not an imminent threat to the security of the US is now in some areas a haven of the most murderous, dedicated enemies of the US, including al-Qaida.\" </p> <p>In Iraq, the US cannot escape from its own trap without even more ruinous consequences. \"If we walk away the place falls apart disastrously. Americans are not only a bulwark against civil war. They are a stimulus for nationalist and Islamic fundamentalist mobilisation. We need to reduce that stimulus and provocation without robbing the new Iraqi state of the bulwark it needs. </p> <p>\"We have been dealt a bad hand by mistaken decisions, going to war, in prewar planning and in the first few months after the war ended. A lot of negative things are difficult to alter because of mistakes that were not inevitable. There are really no good options.\" </p> <p>Fallujah remains under terrorist control; insurgents run rampant even beyond the Sunni triangle; the number of US soldiers killed spirals towards 1,000; the Iraqi army, disastrously disbanded by the CPA, is being reassembled and trained. The American campaign is consumed with false charges made by a Republican front group about the medals that John Kerry earned in a war more than 30 years ago. The arrogant and incompetent blunders of the Bush administration in Iraq are not debated. On the eve of the Republican convention, Bush burnishes his image as a prudent and reassuring leader. The lethal realities of his \"hubris and ideology\" are for the moment off the screen. Mission accomplished. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:sidney_blumenthal@yahoo.com\">sidney_blumenthal@yahoo.com</a></p>",
  "John Kerry has so far succeeded in fending off attacks on his Vietnam war record to stay level with George Bush in national popularity ratings - and ahead in most of the 20 swing states where the election will ultimately be decided, according to a poll published yesterday. <p>The survey, by Zogby International, suggested that the president would go into next week's Republican convention in New York facing a serious challenge. </p> <p>Mr Kerry is leading in 13 of the 20 battleground states, where both campaigns have focused almost all their efforts. That lead translates into a disproportionate advantage in the electoral college, which will formally choose the next president. </p> <p>But Mr Kerry's advantage, however large, remains tenuous. His margin in each of the battleground states is just a few percentage points, and so it would only take a small swing towards Mr Bush to transform the electoral college in the opposite direction. </p> <p>The Democratic senator has also already enjoyed the benefit conferred by his party convention nearly a month ago - and the mostly positive media coverage that came with it. </p> <p>Next week it will the Republicans' turn to hog the airwaves from Madison Square Garden in Manhattan. </p> <p>\"Kerry's support is wide, but Kerry's problem is it's not deep,\" John Zogby, the head of Zogby International, said yesterday. \"It's not enough to close the deal.\" </p> <p>The polls suggest Mr Kerry is standing firm among swing state voters in the face of a campaign launched by a group calling itself Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, who accuse the candidate of falsifying his Vietnam war record - the recurring motif of his election campaign. </p> <p>The anti-Kerry advertise-ments have only been aired in a handful of swing states, but intense coverage of them in the national press has meant that 57% of the population has heard of or seen them, according to the Annenberg Public Policy Centre. </p> <p>A survey by the centre found that the electorate as a whole was evenly split over whether to believe the allegations against Mr Kerry, although they do seem to have hurt the candidate among his fellow war veterans. </p> <p>After highlighting his Vietnam experience on a navy swift boat - a light patrol boat - at every turn at the Democratic convention, Mr Kerry was level with the president among veterans. In a CBS poll last week, however, he was trailing by 37 percentage points to 55. </p> <p>Recent polls suggest that - in terms of national public opinion - the race is still evenly balanced. Last week's CBS poll had Mr Kerry ahead nationally by 46 percentage points to 45, with the third party candidate, Ralph Nader, claiming only 1% support. </p> <p>Mr Kerry may have compensated for his lost ground among veterans by winning support away from Mr Nader. </p> <p>The Democrat may also be benefiting from growing disillusion with the Iraq war. An Associated Press/Ipsos Public Affairs poll released yesterday found that half the electorate believed the US had \"made a mistake in going to war in Iraq\", compared with 40% in April and 34% last December. </p> <p>The latest reports on the Abu Ghraib prison scandal may deepen that spreading mood of cynicism. </p> <p>\"We still see a plurality who support the war, but if you ask if the war has been worth it, you get a different result,\" Mr Zogby said. \"The passion is generally with the opposition right now.\" </p> <p>Mr Kerry's support is also better distributed for winning the electoral college at the moment. Each state sends a certain number of \"electors\" to the 538-seat college, depending on its population. Winning a state means capturing the votes of its electors. </p> <p>The Democratic senator's more evenly spread support gives him an edge in this system. Given the current state of the polls in the battleground states, Mr Zogby estimated Mr Kerry was ahead in electoral college votes by 286 to 214, more than enough to carry the day. \"If the election was held today Kerry would win,\" he said. </p> <p>The Democrat is well ahead in major swing states such as Pennsylvania and Michigan. He is lagging behind the president in another, Ohio, and the two are in a dead heat in the biggest battleground state, Florida, the scene of the 2000 deadlock. </p> <p>Mr Kerry's campaign has also managed to turn four states formerly assumed to be safely in the president's column into swing states: Virginia, North Carolina, Arizona and Colorado - forcing Mr Bush to defend corners of the south and west he had taken for granted a few months ago.</p>",

  "Hugh Shearer, who has died aged 81, governed Jamaica during a watershed period of Caribbean history. The heroic figures leading the island colonies to independence from Britain were uneasily confronting the new \"black power\" movement imported from the United States civil rights struggle, which challenged their authenticity and authority. The region's traditional plantation crops were giving way to a broader economic base of tourism and manufacturing, and this, too, disturbed the social order. <p>The humbly born Shearer began his career at 18 as an official with the Bustamante Industrial Trade Union (Bitu), the country's biggest union and the industrial arm of the conservative Jamaica Labour Party (JLP). Both were dominated for 40 years by their tempestuous founder, Sir Alexander Bustamante, Jamaica's first prime minister, in whose shadow he toiled much of his life. </p> <p>Shearer became an MP in 1955, but lost his seat four years later. When Bustamante became ill in 1964, he made Shearer unofficial head of the union and Donald Sangster the acting prime minister. At the 1967 election, won again by the JLP, Bustamante retired in favour of Sangster and handed over his parliamentary seat to Shearer, who became foreign minister. </p> <p>When Sangster died six weeks later, Shearer was picked to succeed him as prime minister. He was faced with demands for greater economic and social justice, presented as black rights, then a touchy issue in Jamaica, where colour differences were sharper than elsewhere in the Anglo-Caribbean. </p> <p>The spark was provided by Walter Rodney, a young Guyanese lecturer at the local University of the West Indies campus and apostle of the new movement. He urged students and poor Jamaicans to revolt against the country's colonial structures and raised the spectre of class war. </p> <p>When Rodney went on a brief trip abroad in October 1968, Shearer refused to allow him back into the country. The several days of rioting and destruction that followed - known as the Rodney Riots - plus a ban on \"black power\" and socialist literature by the panicked ruling elite, became a rallying point for the region's burgeoning new left and for demands that Caribbean social problems be seriously tackled. </p> <p>Shearer's Canute-like gesture undermined his authority, despite impressive economic growth figures and an extensive school-building programme. He was damaged, too, by over-identifying with Bustamante in efforts to establish himself. He also faced a charismatic rival in Michael Manley, leader of the opposi tion People's National Party who, though upper-class, adopted third-world, populist, regional, black power and Rastafarian themes, presenting himself as a more modern leader and pointing to the JLP as a tool of the brown and white elite and bastion of a bygone order. </p> <p>The gentlemanly Shearer was also being shunted aside by a cabal of light-skinned ministers in his government and, after Manley's landslide victory in the 1972 general election, he came under attack from their leader, the US-born Lebanese-Jamaican Edward Seaga, who seized control of the JLP from him in 1974. </p> <p>When Seaga, helped by covert US efforts to destabilise Manley's leftwing government, won the 1980 elections, he made it up to Shearer by naming him as token deputy prime minister and foreign minister with the brief of cutting ties with neighbouring Cuba and firmly aligning Jamaica with the US. </p> <p>He was used as a deceptively gentle face of a government whose economic harshness and cold-war policies aped those of President Reagan and Margaret Thatcher and shocked many in the region. When the JLP was beaten at the polls in 1989, Shearer returned to his lifelong work of running the Bitu. </p> <p>He was twice married and leaves a son and two daughters. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Hugh Shearer, politician and trade unionist, born May 18 1923; died July 5 2004.</p>",
  "Zimbabwe's opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) announced yesterday that it will boycott all future elections until President Robert Mugabe's government changes its electoral system, ends state violence and repeals repressive media laws. <p>The decision comes ahead of parliamentary elections in March. Mr Mugabe, who has led the country since independence from Britain in 1980, is seeking to consolidate his hold on power after narrowly winning re-election in a 2002 vote condemned by independent observers for widespread intimidation and vote rigging. </p> <p>Zimbabwe was suspended from the Commonwealth after the last elections. Last December Mr Mugabe pulled his country out of the Commonwealth when its leaders refused to lift the suspension. </p> <p>The opposition yesterday called on the Mugabe government to observe electoral guidelines established by the 14-member Southern African Development Community (SADC) at its summit in Mauritius last week. </p> <p>\"Until there are tangible signs the government is prepared to enforce the SADC protocols on elections, the national executive has today decided to suspend participation in all forms of elections in Zimbabwe,\" said an MDC spokesman, Paul Themba Nyathi. </p> <p>When the regional group agreed on the standards for elections it said any country that did not abide by them would be suspended. The Mugabe government promised a number of electoral reforms in June which it said would bring Zimbabwe in line with regional standards, but civic leaders and the opposition dismissed the changes as merely \"cosmetic\". </p> <p>The SADC chairman, the Mauritian prime minister, Paul Berenger, also said Mr Mugabe's reforms did not go far enough and called on him to allow opposition parties to campaign freely, to stop all state violence and to end repression against the media. </p> <p>The SADC electoral charter also calls for a transparent voter registration process and scrutiny of the voters' roll. By boycotting the parliamentary elections until the Mugabe government meets the SADC protocol, the MDC is trying to force other governments of southern Africa to put pressure on the Harare administration. </p> <p>\"The MDC has put the ball in SADC's court. The leaders of the region must now demand that Mugabe create the conditions for fully free and fair elections,\" said a political analyst in Harare. </p> <p>\"It will put [South African president Thabo] Mbeki in a tight spot. But when they passed the SADC electoral charter they knew full well that Zimbabwe does not meet any of the crucial standards. Now they must press Mugabe to meet those standards or face suspension.\"</p>",
  "The US president, George Bush, and his Democratic challenger, Senator John Kerry, are running virtually neck and neck in the race for the White House, pollsters said today. <p>The bipartisan <a href=\"http://www.tarrance.com/battleground.html\">Battleground Poll</a> found 48% of respondents backing Mr Kerry and his running mate, John Edwards, while 47% supported Mr Bush and the vice-president, Dick Cheney; 3% favoured the independents Ralph Nader and Peter Camejo. </p> <p>Because of the deadlock both sides needed to focus on maintaining existing support and making sure voters turned out for elections, pollsters said. </p> <p>However, Mr Kerry already appears to have solidified support among some of the groups crucial to his chances of victory in November, such as black voters and union members. </p> <p>His ratings showed a little movement after the Democratic National Convention last month in Boston, gaining slightly in some polls.</p> <p>Among these was the recent <a href=\"http://www.zogby.com/\">Zogby International poll</a>, which had him <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uselections2004/story/0,13918,1291085,00.html\">edging ahead</a> of Mr Bush in key swing states. </p> <p>But the fight is as much about hanging on to support as winning new voters. The Battleground Poll, sponsored by George Washington University, found 84% of voters saying they had already made a definite choice for president. That compared with 64% at a comparable time in the late summer of 2000, before the last presidential elections.</p> <p>Mr Bush will be attempting to influence the electorate at the Republican National Convention next week in New York.</p> <p>However, pollsters Ed Goeas, a Republican, and Celinda Lake, a Democrat, who worked together on the Battleground Poll, said the convention was unlikely to conjure up significant new support. </p> <p>Mr Goeas said: \"Realistically the Bush campaign should expect little or no bounce ... because of the polarised political environment.\"</p> <p>Ms Lake said: \"There's nobody left to bounce... The undecided voters, who tend to be female and non-college, will decide late.\" </p> <p>A key priority for Mr Bush after the convention will be to regain the advantage in his \"intensity of support\", according to Mr Goeas. </p> <p>The poll found that evangelical Christians, a Republican-leaning group, had been contacted by campaign workers at a higher rate than black and Hispanic people, who tend to lean toward the Democrats. Ms Lake said that meant Democrats would need to push hard to match the Republican outreach. </p> <p>However, a poll yesterday in the <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/\">Los Angeles Times</a> put Mr Bush ahead of Mr Kerry for the first time this year, with 49% of registered voters favouring Mr Bush against 46% for Mr Kerry. </p> <p>The survey indicated that attacks on Mr Kerry over his Vietnam service record had hurt him, the LA Times said. </p> <p>The Battleground Poll and the Los Angeles Times each contacted around 1,000 voters last week and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3% points.</p>",

This morning Senator Clinton told reporters: \"Given the challenges and dangers in the modern world we all inhabit, working towards further resolution of the issues that are tediously stubborn and difficult here in Northern Ireland is essential not only to the progress which can occur here but could be a real example to what can be done elsewhere.\" </p> <p>Mr Clinton will also be selling his memoirs, My Life, as part of a book signing tour, while his wife delivers a lecture on peace and reconciliation at the University of Ulster, where she will also receive an honorary degree in law.</p> <p>Senator Clinton will be speaking in honour of the veteran Irish-American politician and former speaker of the US House of Representatives, Tip O'Neill.</p> <p>Today she told a \"Vital Voices\" conference that people in Northern Ireland had to cement the peace process by building up trust and confidence across communities. </p> <p>\"Ultimately it has to be in the minds and hearts of the people,\" she said \"Women play a critical role in doing that.\" </p> <p>Mr Clinton made three trips to Belfast during his presidency, memorably receiving almost rock star-like treatment.</p> <p>Northern Ireland's politicians will take part next month in crucial peace process negotiations aimed at reviving the power-sharing executive and assembly, which have been suspended since October 2002.</p> <p>Mr Blair and Mr Ahern will chair the talks at Leeds Castle in Maidstone on September 16.</p> <p>However, with the Rev Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionist party and Sinn F\u00e9in now the two largest parties in Northern Ireland, the task facing all the participants is huge - Mr Paisley refuses to meet with, let alone talk to, his nationalist counterparts.</p> <p>All sides will need to guarantee the stability of the political institutions and the DUP, in particular, will want the IRA to declare an end to all paramilitary and criminal activities if it is to share power with Sinn F\u00e9in.</p> <p>Mr Clinton was proud of his involvement in the early stages of the peace process in securing an IRA ceasefire and also in the final hours leading up to the 1998 Good Friday agreement. </p> <p>At various stages of the process since the agreement, he has telephoned and met unionist and nationalist politicians in the province in a bid to persuade them to remain focused on securing lasting peace and power-sharing. </p> <p>Senator Clinton has also taken a keen interest in encouraging Northern Ireland's politicians to go the extra mile for peace. </p> <p>Her husband received an honorary degree from the University of Ulster during his visit to Northern Ireland in 1995.</p> <p>He returned to the university in May 2001 to inaugurate the WJ Clinton Scholarship to help children from disadvantaged areas get a university education. He made the journey once again in July 2003 to mark the inauguration of Professor John Hume's tenure as the Tip O'Neill chair.</p>",
  "<b>The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and Clarifications column on Friday October 8 2004</b> <br> In this article, we refer to CACI. CACI International provided interrogators at this detention centre and complained that we suggested, wrongly, that the report made findings that they were involved in the worst instances of prisoner abuse. <p> We are happy to make clear that although there were some findings of prisoner abuse against CACI interrogators, they were not the most serious and they did not involve the instances of torture, rape or other sexual abuse identified in the report and which have been widely reported in the press and depicted in photographs. <br><br></p> <p>A US army report into the Abu Ghraib prison scandal found evidence of widespread abuse, including clear instances of torture involving military intelligence interrogators and private contractors. </p> <p>The report, the second on the scandal to be released in two days, documented 44 incidents of abuse with the direct involvement of 23 military intelligence soldiers or officers and four contractors working with interrogators. </p> <p>The report, chaired by Major General George Fay, makes it clear that the scale of the abuse at the prison outside Baghdad went far beyond the seven military police guards facing charges. It included sexual abuse and the deliberate use of dogs to terrify teenage inmates. </p> <p>Asked if the treatment amounted to torture, Gen Fay said: \"It's a harsh word but unfortunately in a few cases it was appropriate.\" </p> <p>Another author, General Paul Kern, said the worst instance involved a competition between dog handlers to try to make adolescent prisoners wet or soil themselves. \"Two adolescents [were subjected] to terror from the dogs for the purposes of a game between the two dog teams to see ... if they could get their bowel or bladder to move,\" the general said. </p> <p>The report recommended that the most senior military intelligence officer at the prison, Thomas Pappas, face disciplinary action, and found, like a Pentagon report published on Tuesday, that the US military's lack of preparedness and confusion over permissible interrogation techniques contributed to the offences. </p> <p>Coming only a day after a Pentagon panel concluded that responsibility for the scandal ran all the way up the chain of command to the defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, the latest disclosures add to George Bush's problems in the run-up to the Republican party convention in New York next week. </p> <p>His presidential rival, John Kerry, yesterday called for Mr Rumsfeld's resignation. </p> <p>\"From the bottom of the chain of command all the way to the top, there needs to be accountability,\" Mr Kerry said. \"The [Pentagon] report makes clear that Secretary Rumsfeld was responsible for setting a climate where these types of abuses could occur.\" </p> <p>The Fay report concluded: \"There is no single simple explanation for why this abuse at Abu Ghraib happened. The primary causes are misconduct (ranging from inhumane to sadistic) by a small group of morally corrupt soldiers and civilians, a lack of discipline on the part of the leaders and soldiers of the 205th [military intelligence brigade], and a failure or lack of leadership by multiple echelons within [the Abu Ghraib task force].\"</p>",
  "<p>Ok, so think The Boys From Brazil meets I, Robot with a twist of The American President. It's an issue movie with romance and sci-fi thrown in! Opening credits run under a ragged brass band theme playing a downbeat, gloomy version of The Star Spangled Banner. A moving camera takes in dejected people clustered in groups around a vast arena wearing stars'n'stripes T-shirts, stars'n'stripes top hats, etc. They are wearing buttons saying Kerry for President 2004. Some are staring vacantly ahead; some are openly sobbing in each other's arms. </p> <p>Cut to: Democrat party headquarters. Spin doctors are dejectedly watching a TV talk show where pundits are saying: \"What lost it for Kerry was the stem cell research issue.\" The TV has a montage of ordinary Americans denouncing amoral stem cell research, cloning and Josef Mengele Nazi-style eugenics. The young excitable spin doctors snap the TV off and argue amongst themselves that the stem-cell issue is just a sideshow. The problem is Kerry was a dullard. They need a charismatic leader. </p> <p>Over the weekend, the chief spin doctor Ted Tipton (for casting, I'm thinking Ben Affleck) is talking with his adoring but mutedly sexy wife Beth (I'm thinking Anne Heche), who is a medical researcher. In the foreground is a cot with their tiny baby daughter, Hillary. Ted is depressed and thinking of quitting politics. Beth too is depressed. With no strong leader, the Democrats could be out of power forever and no progress will be made on genetic research. Then there is a knock at the door and a crazed, wild-haired scientist (Jeff Bridges) enters carrying what he claims is a fragment of Monica Lewinsky's sperm-stained dress. Why not use it to clone Bill Clinton? </p> <p>Later in secret, in Beth's lab, fragments of sperm are teased off the dress material with a Q-tip and placed in a test-tube and then fused with a donor egg from Beth herself. They are placed in a freezer with plenty of dry-ice, etc. Ted and Beth look at the scientist and ask: \"Are you sure this is ethical?\" </p> <p>Cut to: 30 years later. At the victory party for the 2034 presidential election, Ben Tipton is anointed leader - an eerie dead ringer for the young Clinton (perhaps Tim Robbins?). His running mate is young Hillary Tipton, a baby when the secret clone was carried out (she could be played by Gwyneth Paltrow). TV interviews give a rundown of how Ben was the \"adopted son\" of Ted and Beth Tipton who appear in full ageing makeup. </p> <p>Hillary, the new vice-president, attempts to call on Ben at the White House to discuss politics, and is disconcerted to see interns gigglingly exiting his office. They discuss a range of issues. Then he invites her out for lunch. In soft-focus, Hillary realises that despite his roguish reputation she has real feelings for him, and the fact that they are only sibling and foster-sibling means that there should be no bar to marriage. This breaks the heart of her boyfriend Jeb (Giovanni Ribisi). </p> <p>Montage of excited newspaper and magazine reports: are Ben and Hillary going to be more than prez and vice-prez? Is romance in the air? Ted Tipton worriedly considers the matter. He asks Beth if they should reveal to Ben that he is in fact that the clone of (the late) Bill Clinton and also Beth's son? </p> <p>Then Hillary comes to see them, announcing that she and the president are secretly engaged. Ted and Beth are deeply disturbed. In a private mother-daughter chat, Beth asks Hillary if they have slept together, and Hillary responds indignantly that it's none of her business but, as a matter of fact, no. Ben is saving himself for the wedding night. </p> <p>A new stem cell research bill is put before Congress. The president makes a televised speech, in which he is fully expected to endorse this liberal measure. But no. He announces that he is utterly opposed to crossing the ethical boundary of stem cell research. The Jeff Bridges scientist, now of almost Methusaleh age, calls on Ben and Beth and cacklingly reveals that he secretly added some hair clippings to the DNA he gave them - belonging to the notorious rightwing talkshow host, Rush Limbaugh. Enough to tilt the clone's views towards the right. It is all a fiendish plot to get a covert Republican into the White House! </p> <p>At the wedding of the President and vice-president, Ted and Beth make a sensational intervention when the minister asks if anyone knows of any just cause. To an astonished audience, they reveal that Ben is a clone of Bill Clinton and Rush Limbaugh and in any case the marriage would be incestuous. Hillary runs out of the chapel sobbing. </p> <p>Final scene shows Ben Tipton as a blackjack croupier in a Vegas casino. Hillary marries Jeb, and as president passes enlightened genetic research measures. Credits! Whaddaya think?</p>",
  "<p>The rancorous debate over John Kerry's Vietnam war record claimed a second victim within the Bush re-election team yesterday, when one of the campaign's top lawyers resigned. </p> <p>Benjamin Ginsberg stepped down as chief outside counsel after it emerged that he had advised the Vietnam veterans' group challenging Mr Kerry's account of his military service. </p> <p>On Saturday Ken Cordier, a veteran who appears in one of the commercials, resigned from the Bush campaign's veterans' steering committee. </p> <p>\"I cannot begin to express my sadness that my legal representations have become a distraction from the critical issues at hand in this election,\" Mr Ginsberg said in a letter to Mr Bush, adding that he had decided to resign so as not to \"distract from the real issues\". </p> <p>Mr Ginsberg is a prominent Washington lawyer who played a leading role in the Florida election recount in 2000. His firm has received $256,000 from the current Bush campaign. </p> <p>But it is his role as an unpaid legal adviser to the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth that led to his resignation. Under campaign finance rules, such groups cannot coordinate their activities with the candidates' campaigns. The Kerry camp claimsthe involvement of Mr Ginsberg is a violation of this code and adds legitimacy to the adverts. </p> <p>Despite both sides' insistence that they wanted to shift the focus away from Mr Kerry's war record, the issue stayed in the spotlight yesterday. Max Cleland, the Vietnam veteran and former senator who introduced Mr Kerry at the Democratic convention, was due to arrive at Mr Bush's Texas ranch to deliver a letter calling on the president to condemn the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth commercials.</p>",

  "One of Tony Blair's most loyal colleagues, the former energy minister, Brian Wilson, is to stand down at the next election after 18 years in parliament. <p>One of the Scottish Labour party's biggest hitters, Mr Wilson, 55, is currently the prime minister's special representative on overseas trade, having held six ministerial posts. </p> <p>Last summer, he stood down from government citing a desire to spend more time with his family. His decision not to contest his Cunninghame North seat will therefore come as little surprise to many colleagues, and his announcement, in a letter to his constituency Labour party, confirms the move is for personal rather than political reasons. </p> <p>As the sitting MP for an area which is to be absorbed into the newly created constituency of North Ayrshire and Arran, Mr Wilson would have been Labour's sole nominee for the new seat. A full selection process will now be held for a constituency with an estimated potential majority of 11,000. </p> <p>Last night, Tony Blair paid tribute to the former journalist, who has been a minister in education, the Scottish Office, the Department of Trade and Industry and the Foreign Office, saying he had been \"a first class minister and politician, and a good friend over many years\".</p>",
  "The tension at the centre of the Republican party generated by the issue of gay marriage rights has been brought to the surface, days before its national convention, by Vice-President Dick Cheney declaring that the decision should be left to individual states. <p>This conflicts with President George Bush's backing for a constitutional amendment to define marriage as a union between a man and a woman, and with the position likely to be taken by the convention. </p> <p>At a campaign meeting in Iowa on Tuesday Mr Cheney acknowledged in public for the first time that one of his daughters is gay. </p> <p>\"Lynne and I have a gay daughter,\" he said when asked by a member of the audience what he felt \"in his heart\" about the issue of same-sex marriage. \"So it's an issue that our family is very familiar with.\" </p> <p>He added: \"With respect to the question of relationships, my general view is that freedom means freedom for everyone. People ... ought to be free to enter into any kind of relationship they want to.\" </p> <p>His daughter, Mary, who works on his campaign, was in the audience. </p> <p>\"The question ... is what kind of official sanction or approval is going to be granted by government,\" Mr Cheney said. </p> <p>\"Historically, that's been a relationship that has been handled by the states. The states have made the fundamental decision in terms of defining what constitutes a marriage.\" </p> <p>His view differs from the position likely to be adopted at the convention, where gay marriage, abortion rights and stem cell research are emerging as the issues that will define whether the party appeals to its conservative base or attempts to be more sympathetic to its moderate factions. </p> <p>His comments were seized on by supporters and opponents of same-sex marriage. </p> <p>\"President Bush must be feeling the heat,\" said Cheryl Jacques of the gay rights organisation Human Rights Campaign. \"Millions of Republican families, like the Cheneys, have gay friends and family members and are offended by President Bush's efforts to put discrimination in the constitution.\" </p> <p>But Tony Perkins of the Family Research Council said: \"I find it hard to believe that the vice-president would stray from the administration's position on defence policy or tax policy. </p> <p>\"For many pro-family voters, protecting traditional marriage ranks ahead of the economy and job creation. We are left to wonder why the vice-president is allowed to depart from this position when the top of the ticket is unified on all other issues.\" </p> <p>Although some analysts say that the gay marriage issue will not have an influence on the outcome of the election, arguing that it is not a swing issue, others point out that it is a key issue in mobilising core supporters on both sides. </p> <p>The Republican national convention certainly seems likely to take the issue seriously, and the conservatives are likely to have the upper hand, despite a number of prominent moderates being due to speak in prime-time. </p> <p>Its draft position, released on the same day as Mr Cheney's remarks, says: \"We strongly support President Bush's call for a constitutional amendment that fully protects marriage. </p> <p>\"Attempts to redefine marriage in a single city or state could have serious consequences throughout the country, and anything less than a constitutional amendment, passed by Congress and ratified by the states, is vulnerable to being overturned by activist judges.\"</p>"
