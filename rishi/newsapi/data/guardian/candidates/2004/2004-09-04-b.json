  "<p>As someone says in David Hare's play, Stuff Happens, war should be the politics of last resort. In Iraq, the neocons jumped the gun. The rush to battle may have been outpaced, though, by the speed of the stage transfer. War is now the theatre of first resort and George W Bush is filling houses everywhere. </p> <p>In New York, a Bush-based oeuvre sprawls through Broadway. In London, Tim Robbins's antiwar satire, Embedded, a queasy hybrid of Journey's End and Spitting Image, has just gone into preview. So, at the National Theatre, has Hare's state-of-the-nation epic, greeted, like every new Hare play, with the awe that once presaged a royal birth. </p> <p>Political theatre is back, the pundits keep saying, but what's new? Ever since the ancient Greeks turned foreign policy into myth, engaging with the public world has been good box office. Arden and Wesker chronicled working-class emancipation. Caryl Churchill echoed feminist dreams. And now, at a time when politics and plays are, individually, the dullest shows in town, a mixture can have magical results. </p> <p>Some hits, such as Michael Frayn's Democracy, a study of espionage in the time of Willy Brandt, are specifically political. Others plug the gaps of what governments should be saying. Alan Bennett's The History Boys explores, in a way that ministers do not, what education is for. It also points to other possibilities. </p> <p>At this rate, the new Mary Poppins may be a lesson in Ofsted-outlawed daycare. Singin' in the Rain might nod at climate change. The Almeida Theatre's forthcoming musical version of Brighton Rock could serve up Graham Greene's story of Thirties seaside gangs as a parable of antisocial behaviour in pre-asbo times. You cannot, on current trends, have too much politics in theatre and you certainly cannot, in his admirers' eyes, have too much David Hare. </p> <p>His immense trilogy, an audit of the nation in 1993, explored God, justice and power politics. Perhaps helped along by Bush, who views himself as a trinity of the separate elements, Hare has settled for a single, three-hour treatment of the Iraq war. Professional critics have yet to judge, but they are often kind to political plays. Sometimes too kind. Guantanamo, which has just transferred to New York, is unimpeachable but almost unwatchable. Yet nearly every pundit, from across the political spectrum, loved it. As Michael Coveney, a rare dissenter, has argued, protest is part of the mainstream now. </p> <p>Hare's preview audience, mostly middle-aged, looks familiar. I have seen these people before, steering posters reading 'Make Tea, Not War'. They marched against Blair and now they have come to see him felled. In comfort, though. </p> <p>Anyone who has sat through the spartan Edinburgh Fringe, or recently bought a \u00a340 ticket to a West End show, will be struck by the cheap luxury state-subsidised theatre offers to the grandee playwrights who deplore New Labour and to modern tricoteuses who want to see their leaders flayed. Good manners would stop this audience from tearing Donald Rumsfeld to shreds, if he were to walk into the Olivier Theatre, but no one would be offering him a Malteser either. Journalists aside, I doubt if there is a warmonger in the house. </p> <p>I loathed the Iraq war, but I don't like seeing my anger bounced back at me from stage or screen. I cannot bear the preening Michael Moore or tedious plays served up as balm to protesters. Still, Hare and Nicholas Hytner, the National's director, are never going to do Chomsky with choc ices. Though Hytner has tackled Iraq before, and better, in a Henry V that slipped from simplistic patriotism to the savagery of the battlefield, he and Hare are brilliant enough. </p> <p>The cast is stunning and the soundbites funny. Men in suits marching on and off a stark stage suggest the staff of the Alliance and Leicester on a fire drill, but that is standard for theatre of record. The stasis lies not in the staging of this inventory of history, sanitised as it is, but in its antiquity. Stuff Happened. This is yesterday's story, unstained by blood spilled from Baghdad to Beslan. </p> <p>If Hare's narrative lacks ordinary people, it is also short of a hero. Colin Powell has to plug the gap, even though Bob Woodward, in Plan of Attack, painted him more convincingly as an unhappy compromiser, lacking a hawk's ideology but still content to wave a phoney phial of anthrax as war bait. </p> <p>Then there is the Prime Minister. Hare's Blair is not a moral zealot convinced of his own rightness, but a man racked with doubt. That treatment should surprise no one, for Hare is an improbable iconoclast. He admires Blair greatly, or at least he did. On the only occasion I met him, he was scathing about the 'dead heads' of the cabinet and baffled that Blair could surround himself with such dim lieutenants. Why, he wondered, should someone 'of that intelligence' not want more interesting people around him? </p> <p>Hare did not see, either, how people could argue for a social democratic government and not be implicated in its failure. 'I find this astonishingly easy hatred [of Blair and Brown] irresponsible,' he said. This was before Iraq, but I do not imagine that Hare lightly sheds allegiances. </p> <p>However much he hated the war, he is generous to Blair, so subtly that prowar critics hardly realise why they like the play much better than they expected. </p> <p>Nor do those of us who believe that the Prime Minister behaved unforgivably over Iraq realise at first why we feel short-changed by a litany of war cleansed of death and misery. Hare's analysis, careful, detailed and tidily-arranged, has all the passion of Exchange &amp; Mar t. And yet it is far more than that. There is a message in any good political theatre and Hare's, for all its drawbacks, is among the best. His Powell may be absurdly deified, his Blair too pure, but his Bush character should chill an anti-war, pro-Democrat audience. </p> <p>Hare is a cautious polemicist who realised, way before other satirists and commentators, that Bush is not a parody of a President. His version, more patrician and smarter than the real thing, offers a notion of how the President might look to Republicans streaming home from Madison Square Gardens with their 'Kiss Me!' badges and bottles of 'W' ketchup, for those not wishing to taint their fries with the Heinz brand that enriched John Kerry. </p> <p>Hare's Bush, neither a fool nor a monster, is just a decent, down-home guy with a Bible-bashing, Texan naivety that sidesteps caricature and flatters truth. </p> <p>Perhaps that is the cleverness of David Hare. His catalogue of the past may, after all, point to what comes next. Preview audiences, longing to see a savage judgment, are, instead, watching something that they have not yet dared acknowledge. Far from demolishing George W Bush, Hare is explaining, probably inadvertently, why the blundering overlord of an illegal war is 11 points clear in the polls and within snatching distance of another term in office. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:mary.riddell@observer.co.uk\">mary.riddell@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "Tiffany Watkins stood in front of a projection screen and went through her presentation to the convention delegates. Neither Watkins, nor the audience gathered in the plush New York hotel, were typical Republicans. They were all black. Nevertheless, Watkins, an operative from campaign HQ, urged them to get out the vote for President George W. Bush. 'We are not taking anything for granted,' Watkins warned. <p>Watkins does the bidding of Karl Rove, Bush's trusted campaign strategist, who has masterminded his campaigns since he first ran for the governorship of Texas. Rove's plan is simple: a mass mobilisation of the Republican base, coupled with a brutal media operation that has gone after Democratic nominee John Kerry's Vietnam record, seeking to portray the decorated veteran as a weak-willed liar. </p> <p>Last week, the plan went like clockwork. The New York convention saw a series of brutal attacks on Kerry, lavish praise for Bush and dire warnings about the war on terror. The message was simple: America cannot risk electing Kerry. Bush was painted as a war leader; Kerry ridiculed as an untrustworthy flipflopper. </p> <p>There has been a fundamental shift in the presidential race. Bush's offensive has left Kerry's campaign floundering. Last week, he shook up his top staff, bringing in Clinton era experts. He also went negative, too, lambasting Bush and Vice-President Dick Cheney for dodging Vietnam. For Democrats that means Kerry, at last, has come out swinging. </p> <p>But Republican strategists hope it may already be too late. After months of trailing, Bush has now moved decisively ahead in the polls. A Time poll had him with a huge 11-point lead. Another had him four points up. </p> <p>But Rove is leaving nothing to chance. At a meeting last week of delegates from Ohio, perhaps the most important swing state in the race, Rove exhorted party members to greater efforts. 'Do more than you've ever done before,' he said 'We need to ask everyone we know to get involved in this crusade.' </p> <p>Rove is credited with creating the Republicans' awesome machine. It is a huge pyramid, with Rove at its apex, feeding down in disciplined layer on layer into every county in every state in America. It has databases of tens of millions of voters, has signed up one million volunteers, has put field organisations in key states long before Democratic rivals and has poured millions of dollars into voter registration drives. Rove has learnt the lessons of 2000, when five states were decided by less than half a percentage point. </p> <p>The media operation is equally sophisticated. Kerry's Vietnam record was meant to make the Democrats immune on national security. But Rove has a record of attacking opponents' strengths, not weaknesses. Kerry has faced a full-frontal assault by Republican leaders and shadowy surrogate groups, such as Swift Boat Veterans for Truth. Kerry, a triple Purple Heart winner, has been left desperately fighting allegations that he betrayed fellow veterans by turning against the war. </p> <p>Given that Bush himself dodged Vietnam when family connections got him a place in the National Guard, it was a stunning turnaround that Kerry's support among veterans proceeded to plummet. </p> <p>The war on terror is key to Republican success. It is ever-present on the campaign trail and in television adverts. It was the main selling-point of the convention. </p> <p>New York was a media triumph for the Republicans. Leaders of the Bush campaign have carefully distanced themselves from their dirty tricks squadrons. Instead, they relentlessly focused on the war on terror. Speaker after speaker, from former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani to Bush himself, recalled in starkly personal terms they way they had dealt with the terrorist attacks of 11 September. The war in Iraq was artfully moulded into the war on terror. The message was simple: trust Bush to protect America from terrorist attacks. They have sought to make the election more about electing a commander-in-chief than a president. </p> <p>The most devastating attack came from Zell Miller, a Democrat senator who has effectively defected to the Republicans. Miller laid into Kerry as not strong enough for the job. It was crude theatre. Miller listed defence cuts that he said Kerry had supported and then added: 'The man now wants to be the commander-in-chief of U.S. armed forces? U.S. forces armed with what? Spitballs?' </p> <p>Many pundits decried Miller's speech as over the top. But a survey of a focus group of swing voters in Ohio said they found the speech convincing. Miller's diatribe had hit home. </p> <p>From a distance, at the start of last week, Kerry looked as if he didn't have a care in the world. Resting at his holiday home in Nantucket, he donned a wetsuit for a spot of windsurfing. A day later, he and his wife, Teresa Heinz Kerry, took their motorboat out for a spin. They smiled and laughed as Kerry steered through the choppy waters. </p> <p>But behind the scenes, the atmosphere was feverish. After a dreadful few weeks, the Kerry campaign has been gripped by rumours of a shake-up. Last week, Kerry and his campaign manager, Mary Beth Cahill, finally swooped. In came high-profile names from the Clinton era. Joe Lockhart, a former White House spokesman, will now join Kerry on his travels. Former Clinton adviser Joel Johnson will head a 'war room' to toughen up attacks. </p> <p>Change was needed. Democrats were wrong-footed at their Boston convention. They stressed the importance of not 'Bush-bashing', only to be blown away by Republican attacks throughout late August. Kerry is also said to be furious at the lacklustre response to allegations about his Vietnam record. It put his campaign on the back foot, forcing them to fight on an issue (national security) they thought they had dealt with and keeping the election away from their core strengths, such as jobs and healthcare. 'They are allowing the Republicans to define the issues. You can't win an election that way,' said Ken Warren, a political scientist the University of St Louis. </p> <p>But, Kerry's supporters say, there are two months to go. They insist, despite the last few polls, that the race is still on a knife-edge. They are probably right. There has already been a dramatic shift in gear. Last Friday, Democrats began a $45 million advertising campaign in 20 states, spending more than half of their remaining funds. Kerry also held a midnight rally after Bush's speech that forced him on to the television networks. He used the opportunity to accuse Bush and Cheney of skipping their Vietnam service. 'I'm not going to have my commitment to defend this country questioned by those who refused to serve when they could have,' he said. </p> <p>That could be a fruitful line of attack. Already Bush's hell-raising youth and National Guard service are moving back onto the agenda. Ben Barnes, a Texas politician who says he secured Bush's place in the Air National Guard, is expected to give a TV interview as early as this week. 'I'll have something to say about that,' he told The Observer. </p> <p>A video of Barnes is already circulating on the internet. It was shot several months ago, at a pro-Kerry rally in Austin, Texas. In it, the former lieutenant-governor of the state is blunt. 'I got a young man named George W. Bush into the National Guard,' he says. He then describes how he was spurred to speak out after visiting a Vietnam memorial and feeling guilt at all the sons of the rich and powerful whom he had helped avoid being sent overseas. 'I became more ashamed of myself than I had ever been,' he said. </p> <p>Suddenly America's already bitter, dirty and divisive election has just slipped even further downhill. It is possible that Rove may regret the direction in which the campaign is going. Probably not. One of his first political experiences on a national level was in 1973, when he was accused of holding seminars for college Republicans on dirty tricks techniques. </p> <p>So much is now at stake. Away from Iraq and the war on terror, many Democrats are deeply afraid of the domestic agenda of a Bush second term. Bush has vowed to move on abortion rights, a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage and make his tax cuts permanent. </p> <p>Social and religious conservatives are now firmly in control of the Republican Party. In New York, reporters were banned from a rally of Christian conservatives at the Waldorf-Astoria. Inside speakers debated fighting abortion and trying to remove the separation between church and state in American life. </p> <p>For Democrats, that meeting was a stark example of the importance of this election. Many Republicans, who regard themselves in a 'culture war' with a liberal elite, probably felt the same. But as Republicans left New York last week, they were confident that their side is winning. </p> <p>For the moment, Rove's plan is on track. Meanwhile, Bob Shrum, Kerry's own powerful political mentor, must try to win back the initiative. Republicans take heart from Rove's record. Since teaming up with Bush, Rove has powered Bush to the White House. Shrum, however, who has worked for four different Democratic presidential candidates, has lost each time.</p>",
  "<p>John Winston Howard, Australia's 'little battler' Prime Minister, is facing the political battle of his life as he attempts to come from behind in the polls to win his fourth mandate from voters on 9 October, calling on the electorate to trust his economic management and security credentials. </p> <p>Even by the rough-and-tumble standards of politics Down Under, the first week of the six-week campaign got off to a bitter start, with the Prime Minister being distracted by claims from within his conservative Liberal National Party coalition party that that he is a 'low-life, lying rodent'. </p> <p>Howard, 65, whose sobriquets of 'little Johnnie' or the 'battler' give him a blokey appeal in the nation's crucial outer suburbs, is a wily veteran of more than 30 turbulent years in federal politics. </p> <p>He is seeking what is believed to be a last endorsement from the electorate before retiring as the second-longest serving Prime Minister in Australian history and handing over to his current Treasurer, Peter Costello. </p> <p>For the past eight years Howard has been able to maintain the support of the nation's conservative heartland with his commitment to the Commonwealth and the Queen, rigid ties with the US, a tough stance on asylum seekers, and a strong economic record that has delivered low inflation, near-full employment and sustained growth. </p> <p>Critics pillory the former suburban solicitor as the grey man of Aussie politics, whose craven pursuit of the US alliance landed Australia in the increasingly unpopular Iraq conflict, disengaged the nation from its Asian neighbours, widened the gap between rich and poor, and damaged Australia's reputation with its harsh treatment of illegal immigrants. </p> <p>His adversary is new Australian Labour Party leader Mark Latham, 43. Since his surprise appointment 10 months ago, Latham has invigorated his party and won points from the government by forcing amendments to Australia's free trade deal with the US and pushing healthcare up the political agenda. </p> <p>Latham, who is more akin to John Prescott than Tony Blair, is promising a more egalitarian nation by focusing on what he calls a 'ladder of opportunity', that would deliver better health and education and more accessible housing. </p> <p>'Biffo' Latham, famed for an early-morning brawl with a Sydney taxi driver, is criticised by opponents as a bullying larrakin, a profligate administrator, a republican and a foul-mouthed adversary who remains untested over a long election campaign.</p> <p>He raised eyebrows in Washington with his earthy description of President George Bush as the 'most incompetent and dangerous President in living memory' and attracted criticism for his unparliamentary description of his conservative opponents as a 'conga line of suckholes'. Whether his current lead in the election campaign is due to Howard-fatigue, or an ability to touch a popularist vein will be tested as pressure builds to release his tax, family assistance plans and fiscal priorities. </p> <p>Howard is a poor campaigner who, during his past three campaigns - all under very different circumstances - has overseen a deterioration in the coalition's core vote.</p> <p>There is also disunity within his ranks, and the threat of open revolt about the dumping of an incumbent member of parliament for Malcolm Turnbull, former chief of investment bank Goldman Sachs' Australian operation. Turnbull achieved fame as the barrister who defeated the British government in the Spycatcher case.</p> <p>So far the stock market and Australian currency have largely ignored the promises and threats emanating from both sides of the political fence. The stock market last week hit record highs after a bumper corporate reporting season that featured high dividends, strong earnings and upbeat forecasts. </p> <p>Investors do not seem too worried and analysts are generally relaxed about the closeness of the polling, claiming that past experience shows political instability leading to some short-term market uncertainty but has little lasting impact whether there is a change of government or not. </p> <p>In fact, since 1945, Australian and US shares have done slightly better under Democrat presidents in the US and Labour prime ministers in Australia than under the conservatives. </p> <p>The Australian dollar, which 12 months ago was languishing against sterling and the US dollar, is trading in its historic band of about 70 cents a dollar and is one of the most heavily traded as a haven currency. </p> <p>A Labour government would have little lasting impact on share prices, according to Shane Oliver, chief economist of AMP Capitol Investors, a division of the nation's largest life insurer. </p> <p>Individual sectors that could do well out of the campaign are construction and building if infrastructure spending is raised, life insurers and fund managers because of policies to boost national savings, energy stocks if the Kyoto agreement is ratified and banks if there is any change to the tax treatment of housing. </p> <p>According to opinion polls, the Howard government is regarded as better than Labour at handling national security and the economy. Bookmakers have the coalition winning but the ALP under Latham has narrowed the odds as attacks on Howard's credibility inflict political damage. </p> <p>After 13 years of growth, the economic fundamentals have weakened. Interest rates have risen, caused by insatiable consumer demand. Since Howard came to power, household debt has risen from about 85 per cent of disposable income to 140 per cent. </p> <p>The nation's love affair with property is also being tested as house prices fell for the first time after four years of double-digit growth. Both sides will attempt to exploit fears of rising interest rates in an electoral landscape that has changed as middle-class families move from the inner suburbs for a quiet life in the country - traditional conservative havens. </p> <p>The outcome could depend on whether it will be the 'battler' or 'Biffo' who delivers the killer blow.</p>",
  "It's the stupidity, stupid. John Kerry could take note. He can have the phrase for free. Launch - please, John - please launch a war on stupidity, in these last desperate weeks: it can do no more harm than your current strategy, which appears at the moment to comprise four strands: 1) run away, lip trembling, when someone stupid tells lies about you; 2) make up other lies to shout back, stupidly; 3) ask, dear God, Lee Ryan from Blue to sing at your 19 September fundraiser; and 4) fail, always, to stand up for your beliefs, in case stupid people shout at you. <p>Well I'm sorry, but it's time to say it: for far too long now we have been horrendously soft on the thick. It might be the British A-level stuff making me think this. It might just be my age (though if I was ever prone to arrogance I would tell you here that I've been thinking this since I was about three). But, mostly, it's a statistic: one culled from What We've Lost, the forthcoming book from Graydon Carter, a man whose statistics I will always trust for the highly principled reason that he once wrote something faintly nice about me, and the statistic is this: </p> <p>'Eleven per cent of young Americans cannot find the United States on a map.' </p> <p>Asked to point to the Pacific Ocean, the figure rose to 30 per cent. The percentage unable to identify Afghanistan, Iraq or Israel was 85. </p> <p>There is nothing forgivable about this. It fills me with anger, and horror, and dread, and a scary inability to find any analogy except one. </p> <p>Do you remember playing Trivial Pursuit with thickos? They'd think it was called the Genius Edition, and they'd still be asking, after two hours, what orange stood for; and you'd later scratch your head and wonder how they could be part of the same race - adults, with hair and stuff, and mortgages, and allowed to drive and yes hell to procreate and all the rest; and yet they'd been out with the dates of the Second World War by 50 years, and hadn't ever heard of Louis Armstrong or JFK or Beethoven, and I'm sorry again but why the hell not? </p> <p>And we forgave them. As some forgave, and smiled at, and gave jobs to, Neil and Christine Hamilton that time on Celebrity Millionaire, when they proudly announced they 'didn't know anything' about pop music, while getting so wrong a question designed to be answered with airy ease by a profoundly deaf and syphilitic flea. </p> <p>It's not enough now, any more, with so many unconscionable obscenities happening all over, to 'not know anything'. It's certainly not enough to be proud of it. Those who wear their ignorance with glee should, today, be made to wear bells, be quarantined, be made to trudge in never-ending circles outside the moats which should, by rights, ring our cities: should be forced to wear signs reading 'I went to school, and grew up with other humans, but there's something wrong with my brain and I didn't take any of it in, at all, so I won't worry the rest of you by trying to speak, or vote, or anything'. </p> <p>I'm not asking for everyone to be able to provide the date of the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, or to parse Proust, or even to pronounce him. I simply think there are a few facts that any adult not in receipt of regular and serious medication should be able to remember, for the general welfare of the planet. </p> <p>It's not the genius edition, it's the genus edition. The Second World War took place between 1939 and 1945. And still 11 per cent of young Americans can't find the United States on a map.</p>",
  "The horror of the carnage and the unexpectedly high death toll in the Beslan school catastrophe were visibly etched on Vladimir Putin's face as the beleaguered Russian President toured the small town's hospital soon after dawn yesterday. <p>An official tried to say the security forces had done a good job. He was tersely brushed aside. 'As far as the special forces are concerned this is a separate story. We will talk about it later. Sadly there are many losses,' Putin snapped. </p> <p>When the siege ended, with scores of people running from the burning and shattered building, there were initial hopes that the number of victims might be relatively small. But the creeping death toll has sent a wave of shock across Russia and brought hysteria to Beslan itself. </p> <p>The crisis is the worst in Putin's presidency. It deals a massive blow to his credibility as a tough man with tough policies that can bring Russians security. It has cast new doubts on the effectiveness and professionalism of Russia's police and special forces. It has left Russians feeling more unsafe and defenceless than ever. And it has raised the spectre of unrest across the whole of the North Caucasus. </p> <p>'This is a watershed. Putin will need to improve security across the board. But he will also have to look again at all the political issues surrounding Chechnya,' Dmitri Trenin, a senior analyst at Moscow's Carnegie Centre, a leading think-tank, said yesterday. </p> <p>Like many other experts, he saw the Beslan attack as part of a co-ordinated and sophisticated offensive by Chechen fighters to take the war out of Chechnya. It began in June with an attack by dozens of fighters on several police stations in the neighbouring republic of Ingushetia. </p> <p>Some wore stolen or borrowed police uniforms, which they used in order to set up road blocks, check cars, and kill unsuspecting policemen who rushed to defend their colleagues' headquarters. </p> <p>Reports that the gunmen in the Beslan operation smuggled their huge arsenal of explosives and weapons into the school while repairs were being done during the summer holidays support this version of a meticulously planned operation. </p> <p>The Chechens, aided and financed according to some Russian officials by supporters of al-Qaeda, last week used suicide bombers to blow up two civilian aircraft in midair shortly after they left Moscow. One was flying to the Black Sea resort of Sochi in what Dmitri Trenin sees as a deliberate warning to President Putin who was on holiday there at the time. 'The Chechens wanted to say they could organise their own 9/11,' he said. </p> <p>They also struck last week at a metro station in Moscow, killing eight people. But, with the apparent aim of showing that they were not stopping their operations in Chechnya even while widening the orbit to cover other parts of the Caucasus, they struck several targets in the capital Grozny a fortnight ago, killing several dozen police and Russian troops. </p> <p>The Beslan attack was the climax - at least so far. It was designed for maximum shock on the first day back to school by at least 30 men and women who must have known their chances of emerging alive were minimal. </p> <p>What can Putin do? He sees his first task as preventing the gunmen realising their aim of igniting the north Caucasus. It is less than 10 years since one of the first post-Soviet wars broke out a few miles from Beslan. Ossetians and Ingush fought over a small piece of land on the disputed border between North Ossetia and Ingushetia. Although the shooting stopped, thousands of people were displaced and the underlying issues have not been resolved. </p> <p>Reports from hostages who escaped the Beslan school on the first morning that many of the gunmen were Ingush have been censored off Russia's Kremlin-friendly television channels. Emphasis is being laid on the claim that 10 of the dead gunmen were Arabs, though it is unlikely they would have carried identity documents which could prove the Russian authorities' assertions. </p> <p>The biggest headache is Chechnya itself. Russia still has 20,000 Interior Ministry troops in Chechnya. Adjusting for the small size of the territory and the low population, this is more than twice as many troops as the United States and Britain have in Iraq. Yet the war and Russian soldiers' death toll go on unabated. </p> <p>In public Russian officials and analysts find it hard to call for a change in Mr Putin's efforts to end the war exclusively by military means. Privately, some experts call for some form of talks with a broad range of Chechens, including those linked to the independence movement. They accept that trying to build up only one or two Chechen faction and organising dubious elections to give the Kremlin's placemen a veneer of legitimacy is leading nowhere. </p> <p>The biggest decision is to start a sincere process of talks. Whether Putin will have the courage and the vision to accept the bankruptcy of his military strategy for the last five years is the main question in the aftermath of Beslan.</p>",
  "<p>As the razzmatazz dies down in Madison Square Gardens and the garbage is swept up, the presidential election is less than two months away. Though President Bush has taken a slender lead over his opponent John Kerry - 49-45 per cent - there is still all to play for. The US economy appears to be stabilising, with economic activity moderating as indicated by Intel's confessional and the moderate non-farm payroll number. It is just possible that a flagging economy could play into the hands of Senator Kerry's Democrats. Stock and sector selection will conceivably be more important after 2 November than they might be in normal circumstances. </p> <p>The feeling is that George Bush will probably win by a narrow margin. That being the case, defence and security are likely to be somewhere near the top of the 43rd President's agenda in his second term of office. So were investors to look for some largesse from stocks such as Raytheon, Honeywell, Lockheed-Martin, L-3 Communications Holdings and Boeing, many shrewd operators believe they could be rewarded in the next few years. Most of these stocks have rallied strongly since March, but with President Bush's commitment to defence spending, particularly in the aerospace sector, there could well be more juice in the tank. </p> <p>The drug sector could provide a real 'pot-boiler' of a conundrum. The whole sector has underperformed the market in the most dispiriting manner, thanks in the main to the cantankerous attitude of the FDA and the competition provided by generic manufacturers. Were the Republicans to remain in the White House, investors believe the likes of Pfizer and Merck could be worth a pop. Conversely, with his commitment to cheaper healthcare, a Kerry win could mean universal disenchantment with the sector.</p>",
  "<p>It is just after midday when the funny man with the big red nose, bow tie, bowler hat, painted-on smile and giant shoes enters Zippo's circus ring in London's Highbury Fields to the strains of 'Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head'. </p> <p>The guest star clown has only had half an hour's rehearsal with Norman 'Lord of the Ring' Barrett and resident clown Charlie Cairoli, but there's a smile beneath the panstick and he's clearly a pro. The audience - particularly the adults wielding cameraphones - love it, of course, because it's not every Thursday lunchtime you get to see Paul Newman pouring pasta down people's pants. </p> <p>An hour or so later, Norman Barrett is halfway through his performing budgie act and Newman is in his civvies - sloppy joe, cargo pants, trainers - watching, apparently mesmerised, from the entrance, either oblivious or choosing to ignore thephalanx of hovering girls with clipboards and men in dark suits muttering into their cuffs. </p> <p>My son is, quite rightly, riveted by the sight of the cycling budgies, while I am distracted by the world's most handsome 79-year-old. There's been a landslide or two at Mount Rushmore, but that beautiful profile is still remarkably intact and when he slips the dark shades down to the end of his nose and peers over them, the 20th century's second most famous pair of ol' blue eyes still live up to their press, 50 years after they made their screen debut. </p> <p>He briefly meets my slack-jawed gaze, grins and slips back through the curtain, re-emerging towards the end of the show to sit in the front row next to his elder brother, 85-year-old Arthur. The Newman gene pool means that the siblings look exactly like young people made up to look old: Arthur is wearing a baseball cap, while his wife is a bombshell. </p> <p>When the show (magnificent, but I am a devoted Zippo's groupie) ends, the cast take a bow and Newman stands to receive an ovation from the audience. He is presented with a basket of flowers by Sam, the circus's performing Welsh collie and his graciousness is touching. </p> <p>I've been invited partly because I am a friend of Zippo's but mostly, of course, because I'm a journalist. The event is for charity, raising cash for the London Taxi Driver's Fund for Underprivileged Children, Children with Leukaemia, The Over the Wall Camp and other fine institutions. Newman may not make many films these days (we last saw him in 2002's Road to Perdition) but he's raised $150,000,000 for children's charities through the after-tax profits from his Newman's Own brand. And, given the events that follow, I think it's important that you know this. </p> <p>There is a post-show barbecue for invited guests (the pasta sauces and salad dressings are excellent, not to mention available at a supermarket near you) and the atmosphere is an interesting combination of studiedly casual and quietly feverish. </p> <p>Newman hangs out (he barely sits) in a roped-off area with his family, PRs and minders, while the rest of us try to eat, wrangle our small children and, well, stare. After an hour or so, not to mention a couple of glasses of wine and 20 years in journalism, I feel sufficiently emboldened to join a small, giggly queue of people wearing name tags who are being ushered into the presence of Newman for a quick chat and a photo-opportunity. </p> <p>Admittedly I have been told in advance that any kind of interview with Newman is a non-starter (deals with another newspaper are mentioned) but I figure this hardly constitutes a breach of the agreement and, anyway, I doubt I will be successful: the clipboard girls are in force, the men in suits are in charge and I am bound to be turned away, politely but firmly. Still, an image of my mother in Australia with a framed photograph of her daughter and Paul Newman on top of the telly does cross my mind, so it has to be worth a try. </p> <p>Five minutes later no one - yet - is more surprised than myself to discover that I am standing next to 'Fast' Eddie Felson, Hud Bannon, 'Cool Hand' Luke and Butch Cassidy, and that an 'exclusive', albeit necessarily brief, interview with one of the last great cinematic icons appears to be in full flow. </p> <p>Flett: 'Mr Newman, it's an honour and a thrill. I have to say you make a very good clown.' </p> <p>Newman: (smiles, twinkles) 'Thank you. You know, it's very hard work.' </p> <p>Flett: 'Yes, I think it's two shows a day, six days a week, and three on weekends. Have you done much clowning before?' </p> <p>Newman: (Big grin) 'All my life.' </p> <p>(Very Important Man interrupts: 'Be careful Paul, she's the press!') </p> <p>Newman laughs: 'You know I'm just grateful I didn't get a pie in the face.' </p> <p>Flett: 'I thought you probably would.' </p> <p>Newman: 'No, no, luckily.' </p> <p>Very Important Man: 'Would you like your picture taken now?' </p> <p>Flett: 'Very much' </p> <p>Newman slips his arm round my waist - be still, thumping heart - and we gurn at the camera ('hello Mum!') for two frames - bish, bash, but no bosh. </p> <p>Flett: 'Thank you very much, Mr Newman.' </p> <p>Newman: 'A pleasure.' </p> <p>Flett: 'Now I can go away and faint.' </p> <p>Newman, laughing: 'No, don't do that or I'll have to come and rescue you.' </p> <p>Flett exits stage left, giggling weakly and falls straight into the arms of a PR firestorm. </p> <p>'Please tell me you didn't just have your picture taken with Paul Newman. Tell me you DIDN'T! What are you going to do with that picture ?'. </p> <p>The answer, obviously, is 'very little', not least because I have no way of getting my hands on it. I feel a toddlerish jolt of disappointment, for both me and my mum. </p> <p>A (previously charming) grown man in a suit is close to tears and it appears that jobs, not to mention entire careers, might be on the line, even though I attempt to explain that, to my surprise, it was made very easy for me to talk to Paul Newman, that it was not my intention to upset anybody, that I was simply doing what anyone else would have done in the same situation. I am severely ticked off, made to feel like a cross between a naughty schoolgirl and a traitor to the charity cause. </p> <p>For my sins I swiftly gather up my sleeping son and complimentary bag of BBQ sauces and slope off to the car like a criminal. On the drive home I regret I hadn't made better use of my 90-second 'exclusive', maybe by lobbing Newman a few curve balls about Bush v Kerry, or Iraq, or even something deeply controversial such as the rising obesity levels among pasta-consuming children. Back home, blushes still burning, I hit the phone in an attempt at damage limitation but, abandoned in PR Siberia, nobody will take my calls. </p> <p>Still, the good news is that 24 hours later my son is still raving about Norman's budgies and thoroughly enjoys a lunch made with Newman's Own tomato and basil pasta sauce. And even without the photographic evidence to prove it, nobody can take away the sheer girlish pleasure to be had from spending 90 entirely inconsequential seconds in the company of the fatally charming, waist-squeezing legend (not to mention consummate condiment salesman) that is 'Butch Bolognese'. </p> <p><strong> \u00b7 </strong> Zippo's Circus (minus Paul Newman) is at Highbury Fields, London N5 until 7 Sept; then Swindon 9-14 Sept.

  "<p>The pace of US jobs growth picked up modestly last month while unemployment fell, handing George Bush a potential boost ahead of the presidential election on November 2.</p> <p>The US labour department said yesterday non-farm payrolls - among the most watched of US economic indicators - rose 144,000, about in line with economists' forecasts.</p> <p>Figures for the previous two months were revised up, from 32,000 to 73,000 for July and to 96,000 from 78,000 in June. The unemployment rate fell to 5.4% from 5.5% in July, the lowest in almost three years. </p> <p>The economy has been an important election battleground with Mr Bush facing the prospect of becoming the first president since Herbert Hoover to preside over a net loss of jobs in a four-year term. He shrugged that off yesterday, saying the economy was \"strong and getting stronger\". </p> <p>Treasury secretary John Snow added: \"The American economy continues to move in the right direction, expanding and growing and creating more good jobs. We are not satisfied but, boy, to see that unemployment rate march down is gratifying.\" </p> <p>Economists said the improvement meant another rate rise from the Federal Reserve this month was almost inevitable. The rate, at 1.5%, has been raised twice in the past three months. \"These data suggest that the economy is close to a self-sustaining expansion and that means the Fed probably can continue to raise rates,\" said economist Gary Thayer of AG Edwards and Sons. </p> <p>Economists cautioned that the improvement was modest and did not suggest that the recent sluggishness in the US economy was over. The figures were followed by a service sector report from the Institute of Supply Management showing a fall in the pace of activity to an eight-month low. The ISM manufacturing survey this week also disappointed. </p> <p>Paul Ashworth of consultancy Capital Economics said: \"There is nothing in either of this week's ISM reports to suggest that payrolls will post bigger gains in the coming months than the 144,000 we saw in August, which is barely enough to keep pace with average labour force growth.\"</p>",
  "Bill Clinton, the former US president, checked himself into a New York City hospital yesterday for heart bypass surgery after suffering chest pains and a shortness of breath. <p>\"He will be having surgery early in the week,\" his wife, Senator Hillary Clinton said last night after visiting her husband in hospital.</p> <p>Mr Clinton, 58, went to his doctor on Thursday and was told to have an angiogram, which was administered yesterday and revealed a \"significant blockage\", said a statement from his office, although the spokesman did not think that Mr Clinton had had a heart attack.</p> <p>The television news networks ABC and CBS reported that Mr Clinton was told he needed a quadruple heart bypass.</p> <p>His office said the former president \"went to Northern Westchester hospital yesterday afternoon after experiencing mild chest pain and shortness of breath. Initial testing was normal and he spent the night at home in nearby Chappaqua, New York.</p> <p>\"After undergoing additional testing this morning at Westchester medical centre, doctors advised he should undergo bypass surgery.\"</p> <p>Tony Blair, who suffered heart problems himself last year, sent a personal message to Mr Clinton on hearing the news.</p> <p>Mr Clinton had cancelled a two-day trip with Mrs Clinton, across upstate New York and was taken to a Manhattan hospital.</p> <p>The severity of Mr Clinton's coronary problem was discovered at Westchester medical centre, where he was found to have multiple lesions.</p> <p>The former first lady made a brief appearance yesterday at the New York state fair in Syracuse, after which she noted that her husband was hospitalised and would need heart surgery. She apologised for leaving right away. \"He's in excellent hands,\" she said.</p> <p>Mr Clinton, the 42nd US president, promised at the Democratic national convention in July to be a \"foot soldier\" in John Kerry's race against the Republican president, George Bush. The former president received a rousing welcome from delegates after being introduced by his wife.</p> <p>\"He's going to be fine,\" Mr Kerry told a campaign rally in Newark, Ohio, yesterday.</p> <p>\"But every single one of us wants to extend to him our best wishes, our prayers and our thoughts, and I want you all to let a cheer out and a clap that he can hear all the way to New York,\" the Democratic contender added to cheers.</p> <p>In early 2001, shortly after Mr Clinton's presidency ended, he had a cancerous growth removed from his back which turned out to be basal cell carcinoma, the most treatable form of skin cancer.</p> <p>In 1996, he had had a pre-cancerous lesion removed from his nose, and a year before that had a benign cyst taken off his chest.</p> <p>Other than that, Mr Clinton has had the normal health problems that often accompany ageing - periods of slightly elevated cholesterol and hearing loss - and an appetite for junk food. In 1997, he was fitted with hearing aids. He has also suffered from allergies.</p> <p>He has been active in recent years, giving speeches and completing and promoting his best-selling memoir.</p> <p>His charisma and political clout were seen as a substantial potential asset to Mr Kerry in the coming hectic weeks of the presidential election campaign.</p> <p>Mrs Clinton is gearing up for a 2006 reelection bid seen by many as a prelude to running for president in 2008 should Mr Kerry fail in his run for the White House this year.</p> <p>In LittleRock, Arkansas, Mr Clinton's mother-in-law, Dorothy Rodham, said he had called her after the chest pains started and sounded good.</p> <p>\"He sounded wonderful as usual and very upbeat as he always is,\" she said. \"I just told him how much I love him.\" She said she did not know if he had been in the hospital when he called.</p> <p>Mr Clinton called his stepfather, Dick Kelley, at his Hot Springs, Arkansas, home.</p> <p>\"He's very gung-ho and optimistic about what's going to happen,\" said Mr Kelley.</p> <p>\"I don't know if he was at the hospital. He just wanted me to know before the press, but the press knew before I did,\" he added.</p>",
  "President Vladimir Putin's image was almost bound to take a blow from the bloody end to Russia's latest hostage seizure, according to senior Russian politicians and commentators last night. It could also lead to pressure on civil liberties in Russia and new tensions between the government and the media, they argued. <p>\"It doesn't matter how many people were saved. Everything depends on the number killed and wounded,\" said Vladimir Lukin, Russia's commissioner for human rights. \"It is also not clear how the denouement started. Did they storm the building?\" </p> <p>Mr Lukin, a former Russian ambassador to the US, said there were new worries about how the government would react. </p> <p>\"Fighting terrorism shouldn't lead to state terrorism. We had that under Stalin. Some people fear this could lead to a more authoritarian form of government.\" </p> <p>Gennady Boft, deputy editor of Izvestia, said: \"There will be a tightening of the government's approach to the media.\" </p> <p>Both men were attending a high-level conference of Russian and foreign officials and analysts in the northern city of Novgorod. </p> <p>Others said the Russian president was bound to be blamed for the seizure of the school in the first place. It came in a week in which suicide bombers were allowed to board civilian airliners and blow them up, and others set off explosives at a bus stop and a metro station in Moscow. </p> <p>\"Although the building was just a school and could not easily be expected to be a target, many people will say that Putin is indirectly to blame. The event will be seen as a sign of the incompetence of the security organs and the police,\" said Vitaly Tretyakov, a former editor of the newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta, who now serves on a political thinktank. </p> <p>The president should sack some of his top security officials if he wanted to show he was going to make Russians safer. \"This was what people wanted after the theatre siege in Moscow which went wrong two years ago, but almost nothing was done. This time Putin must show firmness even to people who are friends from his own period as a security man in the KGB,\" he said. </p> <p>Alexei Salmin, the chairman of the national committee of political sociology, said Mr Putin's rating had been falling since his re-election in March. The Beslan drama would not reverse the decline, however many people were saved. </p> <p>\"Much depends on how Putin interprets the event and what he says and does. Public opinion is quite volatile in moments like this, particularly when children are affected,\" he said. \"The number of victims isn't the main thing. It's the number of children.\" </p> <p>The reaction in Northern Ossetia and other parts of the Caucasus could be very sharp, several Russian analysts feared. It could also lead to ethnic tensions in Moscow and other cities with large Chechen populations. </p> <p>Mr Putin has made his reputation on being tough on terrorism, but during his five years in power the war in Chechnya has shown no sign of winding down and the number of car bombs and suicide attacks on soft targets in Russian cities has risen sharply. </p> <p>Russian liberals worry that the solution will mainly involve putting new pressure on the press so that it does not ask awkward questions or point out the failures of Mr Putin's policies. But no one has a clear answer. </p> <p>Vitaly Tretyakov said he saw no merit in the argument that giving Chechnya independence would help. \"I don't believe that letting Chechnya go and putting a fence round it will reduce the attacks. It used to be a popular idea, but fewer believe in it nowadays\" he said. </p> <p>\"Beslan is not Moscow. It's a very small town where almost everyone is related or knows each other. If over 100 people are dead, that affects at least 100 families with all their connections. </p> <p>\"There's bound to be anger, or even a call for revenge. It'll affect the image of the Russian government, and the local government in Northern Ossetia.\"</p>",
  "<p>What appears to be an important harbinger was announced earlier this week: the discovery of planets dubbed \"super Earths\" in a solar system circling a star named 55 Cancri, very much like our own sun. This, some scientists believe, is evidence that rocky planets could be found able to sustain life forms similar to our own. Obviously, this is serious news, that raises a number of astronomical and philosophical questions: will the inhabitants of a \"super Earth\" take our jobs? Can we outsource our call centres there? And, perhaps most importantly, do they play football? Some will say these concerns are trivial compared to the discovery of other species on new worlds, and that we should concentrate on the bigger picture: is the \"super Earth\" harbouring terrorists? Is it hiding weapons of mass destruction? Should we invade it as a preemptive measure? Even if it's got oil? Especially if it's got oil? </p> <p>Already the Washington neocon circuit is abuzz with reports of super Earth exiles publishing hawkish articles entitled \"Shoot first, ask questions later\". Those close to President Bush are ready to accuse presidential rival John Kerry of \"flip flopping\" and being weak on the \"super Earth\" war issue, before the planet's existence has even been conclusively proven. \"If you can't trust a man like Kerry on things that don't exist,\" explained one Bush campaign aide, \"how can you trust him on things that do?\" </p> <p>In this country, concerns about the \"super Earth\" are more muted, other than the possible effect on house prices and the potential strain on the NHS of super Earthians demanding free health care for expensive space-diseases. So far, all we know of the \"super Earth\" is its scorching heat and ferocious cold - much like a typical British summer. Perhaps this new Earth is not so super.</p>"
