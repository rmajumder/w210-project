  "He may be fuzzy on the war and vague on trade but when it comes to women, the Democratic presidential hopeful John Kerry knows his mind. Speaking to the US edition of the magazine GQ he was asked his advice on what to seek in a woman. <p>\"Look for what gets your heart,\" he said. \"Someone who excites you, turns you on. It's a woman who loves being a woman. Who wears her womanhood. Who knows how to flirt and have fun. Smart. Confident. And obviously sexy and saucy and challenging.\" </p> <p>Given the problems the last Democratic president had with women you might have thought this was one subject to steer clear of. But Mr Kerry, who has been lambasted by his detractors for being wooden and standoffish, loosened up in an article entitled \"A Beer with John Kerry\". Asked which actors he found attractive he said: \"I think Charlize Theron is pretty extraordinary,\" before going on to name Catherine Zeta-Jones and Marilyn Monroe. </p> <p>Mr Kerry also reflected on his time as a divorced senator. \"Those were not good days. I think if you ask anyone who's been single on Capitol Hill, you'll find it's no fun. That's not a good world and everyone wants a piece of you, and all I can say is thank God I found Teresa.\" </p> <p>He was probably less thankful after he read the comments of his wife, Teresa Heinz Kerry, in an interview in the latest Reader's Digest, in which she said her husband was not \"truly qualified\" to be president. </p> <p>\"I think nobody is truly qualified to be president of the United States,\" she said. \"I mean, are you qualified to run the world, not run it, but have that influence? No, nobody is.\" </p> <p>Ms Heinz Kerry, who told an over-persistent journalist to \"shove it\" last month, sounded already weary about the prospect of three more months of intensive media attention. </p> <p>\"I'm sure there will be stories that I've given birth to children from Mars,\" she said. \"You know, there are a lot of bored people out there.\"</p>",
  "President Robert Mugabe came under unexpected pressure yesterday when fellow African leaders agreed on exacting standards for democratic elections in the south of the continent. <p>Despite a public show of support for Mr Mugabe at the opening of the Southern African Development Community (SADC) summit, the government leaders voted for election regulations and a commitment to a free press with which the Zimbabwean leader will find it difficult to comply. </p> <p>SADC indicated months ago that the summit, held in Mauritius, would focus on adopting a set of standards for elections for all its member countries. </p> <p>It was widely seen as a warning to Mr Mugabe that he should conduct Zimbabwe's forthcoming parliamentary elections, due in March, without the violence and alleged rigging that have marred the past two. </p> <p>Mr Mugabe tried to mollify his neighbours by proposing limited reforms to Zimbabwe's electoral system in a bill presented to his parliament a few weeks ago. </p> <p>But the incoming SADC chairman, the Mauritian prime minister Paul Berenger, made it clear that the organisation would not be satisfied with merely cosmetic changes in Zimbabwe. </p> <p>\"Really free and fair elections mean not only an independent electoral commission, but also include freedom of assembly and absence of physical harassment by the police or any other entity, freedom of the press and access to national radio and television, and external and credible observation of the whole electoral process,\" Mr Berenger told the assembly, which included Mr Mugabe. </p> <p>He expressed optimism that all member states would gladly comply with the new election charter. </p> <p>He then indicated that SADC had been held back by Zimbabwe's violent elections in 2000 and 2002. </p> <p>\"With free and fair elections due in Zimbabwe at the beginning of next year we can already start preparing for the normalisation of relations between SADC, the European Union and the US,\" the South African Press Association reported him saying. </p> <p>The leaders were expected to agree the details of the election charter before the summit ended last night. </p> <p>Mr Berenger was not alone in pressing Mr Mugabe to reform his ways. </p> <p>The outgoing chairman, the Tanzanian president Benjamin Mkapa, held a two-hour private meeting with Mr Mugabe on Monday which SADC insiders said turned into a dressing down of the Zimbabwean president. </p> <p>This did not stop Mr Mkapa delivering a rousing tirade against western powers in a speech that was widely interpreted as an expression of public support for Mr Mugabe. </p> <p>But the fact remains that Mr Mkapa will be stepping down soon, as will two other SADC heads of state, the Mozambican president Joaquim Chissano and the Namibian president Sam Nujoma. </p> <p>Their example of voluntarily leaving office and allowing their successors to be chosen by election is an implicit condemnation of Mr Mugabe's determination to cling to power no matter what the cost to Zimbabwe's democracy. </p> <p>The South African president, Thabo Mbeki, made no public pronouncement on the electoral standards, but it is unlikely that he, the group's most powerful leader, was not instrumental in designing the trap for Mr Mugabe. </p> <p>The electoral rules make it clear that if Mr Mugabe does not significantly reform his ways he will not have the support of neighbouring countries which have backed him in the past.</p>",
  "<b>New York Times</b> <br> Editorial, August 17 <p>\"The troop redeployment plan announced [on Monday] by George Bush makes little long-term strategic sense. Mr Bush [said] that over the next 10 years, about 60,000 to 70,000 uniformed troops, would be transferred from bases and other military installations in Europe and Asia to the US.</p> <p>\"The Bush administration justifies [this] by pointing to fundamental changes in the geography of threats since the end of the cold war. In Asia, however, that geography has not changed all that much. Washington has inexplicably granted Pyongyang something it has long coveted - a reduction in American troop levels - instead of building those reductions into a bargaining proposal requiring constructive North Korean moves in return.\"<br> </p> <p><b>Washington Post</b><br> Editorial, August 17 </p> <p>\"[The redeployment plan] is a particularly bad idea in Asia. North Korea has pressed for US troop withdrawals for years; now that it is misbehaving in the nuclear field, it receives a reward, and for no concessions. China is increasingly throwing its weight around south-east Asia. </p> <p>\"Europe is less tense, but a US presence is important none the less. The conflicts of the past decade have been in Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq; Africa is of increasing concern; none of these is closer to Kansas than to Germany. Pentagon officials began planning this redeployment before the Iraq war. But it can and must be seen now in the context of a war that has stretched the army dangerously.\"<br> </p> <p><b>Financial Times</b><br> Editorial, August 17 </p> <p>\"Whether it likes it or not, the US is creating an entirely new 'footprint' for its overseas presence. The 130,000 troops currently in Iraq are unlikely to be brought home soon, and the 18,000 in Afghanistan are similarly there for the foreseeable future. New bases are popping up in places such as Qatar and Djibouti, and more are expected to be established in Romania and Bulgaria. </p> <p>\"That is why [Monday's] announcement, while welcomed by most of the US military establishment, has a distinct feel of rearranging the deckchairs, rather than rethinking the destination. The real issue facing American troops today is that there are too few of them to perform the jobs demanded of them.\"<br> </p> <p><b>John Podhoretz</b><br> New York Post, August 17 </p> <p>\"Fewer than 5% of US military personnel will be redeployed. The lion's share of the redeployment will come from troops stationed in Germany. The presence of an enormous clump of American forces sitting in the centre of Europe is an anachronism. </p> <p>\"So why are the Kerry people so hysterical in their denunciations? They realise they've been trumped. Mr Bush has beaten John Kerry at his own game. The hawk of hawks has found a way to tell America that he is bringing soldiers home, even as he vows to stand firm and tough on Iraq until the job is done.\"<br> </p> <p><b>Jacques Schuster</b><br> Die Welt, Germany<br> August 17<br> </p> <p>\"Rumours are still flying round the country that the Americans are pulling their troops out of Germany to punish the government for its rebellious policy on Iraq. But that is just not true, even if the withdrawal will hit some German regions hard. Washington has strategic motives. </p> <p>\"In the future, US troops will be stationed closer to trouble spots and be more mobile. The first countries to be affected by this change are those that lay on the iron curtain in the cold war: Germany, Japan and South Korea. More than 60% of US soldiers are still stationed there. Mr Bush rightly explains that this strength of presence is no longer required.\"</p>",

  "A US-brokered ceasefire halted fighting in western Afghanistan yesterday, ending five days of bloodshed that heightened anxieties in the run-up to October's presidential election. <p>US warplanes circled overhead as the renegade leader Amanullah Khan agreed to withdraw his troops after they had pushed to within 20 miles of the regional capital, Herat. </p> <p>The US declined to say whether Mr Khan was threatened with force, but its envoy to Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, told Reuters: \"He understood where we stood.\" </p> <p>The Pashtun warlord sought to overthrow his powerful Tajik rival and governor of Herat, Ismail Khan. Battles between the two sides, which erupted on Friday, claimed at least 25 lives. Officials expected the death toll to rise. </p> <p>\"We expect everyone to cooperate for the sake of Afghanistan and for their own future,\" Mr Khalilzad said. </p> <p>Some commanders claimed that US fighter jets dropped bombs to stop fighting, in an echo of US firepower used to quell clashes in the same region last year. </p> <p>The fresh flush of violence highlighted the fragile security in parts of Afghanistan in the run-up to the October 9 poll. </p> <p>Afghanistan's interim president, Hamid Karzai, who is expected to win the vote, has to fend off the challenge of 22 other candidates. He must convince voters that he can weld the fractious provinces - plagued by warlordism, a Taliban insurgency and drug money - into a stable and democratic state. </p> <p>Relative calm in recent weeks raised expectations that Afghanistan's gunmen were abandoning bullets for ballots. But the fighting in Herat - and Mr Karzai's reliance on US pressure to stop it - have dented those hopes. </p> <p>Ethnically fuelled clashes and power struggles among the warlords continue to undermine Mr Karzai's efforts to end 23 years of war in Afghanistan. At the weekend he sent hundreds of newly trained national troops, with their US coaches, to bolster Governor Khan's forces. </p> <p>Amanullah Khan, one of the country's most powerful militia leaders, has been a stubborn government critic since 2001. </p> <p>Taliban intimidation also threatens the vote, for which almost 10 million people have registered.

  "<p>At least 17 people were killed and more than 2,000 left homeless after Hurricane Charley swept across Florida over the weekend. The hurricane had been anticipated by weather forecasters but took an unforeseen change of direction, hitting areas that were not expected to be in its path. President George Bush declared the region a disaster area and visited Florida on Sunday to meet those who had been affected. </p> <p>Charley was \"the most powerful Atlantic hurricane of the 21st century - and the worst and most expensive since Hurricane Andrew thrashed south Florida in 1992,\" said the <strong>New York Times</strong>. The cost of the damage it inflicted \"could exceed $20bn [\u00a311bn]\". </p> <p>In an editorial yesterday, the paper reminded its readers: \"The volatility of hurricanes is every bit as dangerous as their brute force.\" But it feared that much of the damage could have been avoided - some Florida residents, taking \"the forecasters too literally\", assumed they would not be in the path of the storm, and failed to adequately prepare for it. </p> <p>\"Forecasters are victims of their own success,\" agreed Florida's <strong>Palm Beach Post</strong>. However, it recommended that more money be made available to improve prediction, especially given \"all the talk of homeland security\". </p> <p>Areas that had expected to be visited by Charley but escaped its path could not believe their luck. The <strong>Bradenton Herald</strong> from Manatee County \"breathed a sigh of relief\" but said that more could be done \"in terms of tougher building codes, stricter zoning restrictions, and innovative, anti-storm construction methodologies\". </p> <p>Others were sceptical of Mr Bush's motives for visiting Florida. \"After Hurricane Andrew left thousands homeless ... the first President Bush's administration was bitterly criticised for moving too slowly,\" said the <strong>Boston Globe</strong>. It concluded that the visit was part of \"a public relations effort apparently designed to show that history would not be repeated.\" </p> <p>The <strong>Miami Herald</strong> put it differently: \"This is 2004. This is Florida. And Democrat John Kerry has a slight lead here,\" it declared. The paper suspected that Mr Bush's true objective was \"garnering more support in a state that gave [him] the presidency by 537 votes in 2000\".</p>",
  "When it comes to American presidential elections, blue blood counts. <p>So say British researchers who predict that Democratic challenger John Kerry will oust President George Bush on November 2 because he boasts more royal connections than his Republican rival. </p> <p>After months of research into Mr Kerry's ancestry, Burke's Peerage, experts on British aristocracy, reported yesterday that the Vietnam war veteran is related to all the royal houses of Europe and can claim kinship with Tsar Ivan \"The Terrible\", a previous Emperor of Byzantium and the Shahs of Persia. </p> <p>Burke's director, Harold Brooks-Baker, said Mr Kerry had his mother, Rosemary Forbes, to thank for most of his royal connections. </p> <p>\"Every maternal blood line of Kerry makes him more royal than any previous American president,\" Mr Brooks-Baker said. </p> <p>\"Because of the fact that every presidential candidate with the most royal genes and chromosomes has always won the November presidential election, the coming election - based on 42 previous presidents - will go to John Kerry.\" </p> <p>Similar research carried out on Mr Bush ahead of the 2000 presidential race showed that he beat Al Gore in the royal stakes, claiming kinship with Britain's Queen Elizabeth as well as with Kings Henry III and Charles II of England. </p> <p>Mr Kerry is a descendant of Henry III and Henry II of England and is distantly related to Richard the Lionheart, who led the third crusade in 1189, according to Burke's. </p> <p>He is also descended from Henry I, King of France and his wife, Anne of Kiev, giving him kinship with the royal houses of Sweden, Norway, Denmark and the House of Rus. </p> <p>Burke's research showed Mr Kerry also has historical political connections in the United States. </p> <p>He is closely related to John Winthrop, the first Massachusetts governor - the state for which he is now a senator - and his maternal grandmother was the granddaughter of Robert Winthrop, who was speaker of the House of Representatives from 1847 to 1849.</p>",

  "<p>America must shoulder some blame for sky-high oil prices. The world's biggest user has made no effort to wean itself off cheap gasoline and its foreign policy has made matters worse.Ch\u00e1vez survives with pride and support intact. Other factors are: </p> <p><strong>Iraq</strong><br> </p> <p>The violence and instability in Iraq is seen as symbolic of a wider battle between the west and militant Islam. Oil traders fear supply disruption as Iraq is an important provider of crude. The country produced 2.5m barrels of oil a day under Saddam Hussein but has failed to reach 2m barrels a day so far this year due to pipeline attacks. Deposing Saddam brought its own uncertainty but the failure of the US government to impose its will there militarily has made matters worse. The White House has lost much of its ability to influence the global oil markets through pressure on Opec allies such as Saudi Arabia. </p> <p><strong>Saudi Arabia</strong><br> </p> <p>The turbulence in neighbouring Iraq and involvement of Saudi nationals in the 9/11 attacks on the US has put increasing pressure on the ruling monarchy in Saudi Arabia. A series of terrorist attacks around the country amid threats to unseat the House of Saud - key Washington allies - has led to fears that the 10m barrels a day production from the world's biggest exporter could suddenly be removed from circulation. The Saudis insist such fears are unwarranted. They point out that key facilities are heavily protected and their political power remains undiminished but deep unease about the country remains. </p> <p><strong>Venezuela</strong><br> </p> <p>The country has a critical role to play in the oil markets because it produces 3m barrels a day of crude and two thirds of this finds its way to the world's biggest user, the US. But Venezuela has seen strikes and other protests against an unpopular government disrupt crude output in the past. The state-owned oil company PDVSA is doubly important as it is also the biggest single refiner and distributor of oil in the US. Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez consolidated his domestic political position by winning the weekend referendum. This should reduce domestic tension but tense relations with the US - due to personal antipathy between Chavez and George Bush - might not be reduced unless John Kerry snatches the presidency this autumn. Western companies have been wary about investing in Venezuelan oil projects under a president who appears to admire Castro more than capitalism. </p> <p><strong>Speculators</strong><br> </p> <p>The biggest new influence on stability is the role of hedge funds and other \"non-commercial\" players in oil futures bourses such as London's International Petroleum Exchange and the New York Mercantile Exchange. Crude prices used to be pushed up and down by the physical requirements of buyers and sellers such as major oil companies. Last year around 60,000 trades of oil futures a day were undertaken by non-commercial players on Nymex. In the first six months of this year, the number had rocketed to 200,000. Speculators bet billions of dollars on future oil prices and thrive on volatility. But their growing presence only seems to encourage more wild price gyrations. </p> <p><strong>Yukos</strong><br> </p> <p>The political wrestling match between Russian president Vladimir Putin and the jailed oligarch Mikhail Khordokovsky threatens bankruptcy of the country's biggest oil company, Yukos. It produces 1.6m barrels a day of oil and faces tax demands apparently driven by a Kremlin desire to demonstrate its power over the commercial world. Traders fear vital production could be knocked out and investment by BP, Shell and other western companies threatened. Russia is the second biggest crude exporter but was also seen by Washington as an exciting new source of energy as US faith in the Middle East deteriorated after 9/11 and now the Iraq war. </p> <p><strong>The majors</strong><br> </p> <p>Western oil companies have not been searching for new oil and gas reserves in the North Sea or elsewhere as they did in the past. Spending on production has also been falling despite historically high global crude prices. Cynics say firms are withholding spending to keep supply limited and prices up. ExxonMobil spent $1.2bn on exploration last year, its lowest for five years, while ChevronTexaco spent $1bn, almost half of what it spent in 1998. </p> <p>Yet ExxonMobil is sitting on $20bn of cash while rivals such as BP and Shell have made record profits but are giving money to investors through share buybacks and major dividend payouts. </p> <p><strong>China</strong><br> </p> <p>The biggest driver of new oil demand, China has been sucking in record imports to feed its commercial and social revolution. Demand rose more than 11% in 2003 and has increased by a further 20% in the first half of this year as the Chinese modernise their infrastructure and swap bicycles for cars. This, plus higher than expected demand in the US as its economic recovery takes root, has taken everyone by surprise although some question the veracity of Chinese statistics. Experts are convinced demand will slump as oil at $45 per barrel damages the world economy and buyers switch fuels.</p>",
  "<b>Foreign affairs</b> <br> <p><b>All the president's women</b><br> \"Thank God President Bush is there because otherwise we would still be vulnerable now,\" Sherry Huffman says, tears in her eyes. A local branch of the Texas Federation of Republican Women (\"the footsoldiers of the party,\" as one describes them) is meeting in Austin, the capital of Bush's home state, and Sherry is joined by around 20 other women, all between the ages of 45 and 60.

They forget about 3,000 people that were killed and the reasons we went to war.\" </p> <p>\"We're well educated when it comes to politics because we've listened to Rush for 15 years,\" her husband Bobby interjects, referring to rightwing talkshow host Rush Limbaugh, a key voice in support of the Bush campaign. </p> <p>\"The United States is the only thing standing between tyranny and the rest of the world now,\" Carol Hanle adds almost breathlessly. \"We saved Europe from Hitlerism and now we're saving the rest of the world from fundamentalist Muslims who will do anything to get where they want to go - even kill children. If people don't start to get behind Bush and stop the negativism, they're going to get theirs.\" </p> <p>\"Look what we did to save France's rear end,\" her friend, Susan Monroe, says. \"If they get in a mess again we will be there again to help them because Americans are the most loving people, but we're tired of getting spat on.\" </p> <p>Her friend Suzanne says when she visited Europe recently she couldn't find anyone with anything nice to say about America. \"I think that's very sad,\" she says. \"I get tired of hearing my country run down all the time.

Does he resemble Joan Collins in Sins? De Beers have announced that sales of rough gems have risen by 7% in the first six months of this year - they rose 6% throughout the 90s - and diamond dealers declare that the surplus is not gracing feminine fingers. </p> <p>Today it is boys, not debutantes, who are throwing themselves through the bullet-proof doors of Graff, Tiffany, Asprey's, Cartier and Garrard, seeking tears of the gods and their four magic Cs - colour, clarity, cut and carat. There's \"a definite growth trend in the market for all types of men's jewellery,\" says Garrard's marketing director, Simon Williamson. </p> <p>Graff offers men a galaxy of \u00a31m diamonds, all as big as the Ritz. It sells earrings, pendants and bangles, or diamond buttons for his dress shirt. Its mysterious bespoke service can render pink diamond suits for European gentlemen of questionable sanity. Garrard the crown jeweller is proffering the Playboy range of bunny cufflinks with diamond eyes. Its Knightrider collection includes a lion's head charm with white diamond eyes for the hairy wrist. </p> <p>Why are the men all glittering now? Can we blame it on the gangster rappers and their Kilburn and Brooklyn acolytes, who invented the word bling to describe the light that bounces off P Diddy's diamonds? Can we acknowledge the oestrogen in the Thames (all the fish are girls now, they say), footballers waxing their armpits, or the marriage of Beckham to Posh and the ensuing global feminisation of the male? Is it Nadia's Big Brother? David Blunkett? Astrology? Search your wardrobe for the answer; but jewels for men are back. </p> <p>Bling is not a novelty. It is a renaissance. Men have always worn jewellery when they could mine, steal or wear it well. The court portraits of Henry VIII, Louis XIV and Edward VII are heavy with bling. Pirates were partial to a spot of bling with their parrots and their pieces of eight. When Charles III is anointed king he will wear the imperial state crown, with its blinding 2,868 diamonds. That is bling cubed. </p> <p>Can we ask in this metrosexual time - does it actually suit them? Is a man in a crown and a necklace sexy? Does he look any better in diamonds than he would in stockings and suspenders and a pair of pumps? Or a Jaeger two-piece? I think jewels look better on women but emancipation is deaf. Zsa Zsa Gabor said she \"never hated a man enough to give back his diamonds\".

Relax, lie back. The switch on the right elevates your feet and knees. The one on the left controls lighting. New age music pipes though the headphones. First it sounds like the ocean, and then like someone with exquisite self-control breaking wind in a bath. Hopefully, you fall asleep. </p> <p>Twenty minutes later, your pod vibrates, the realm of Morpheus evaporates, and you're relieved of about $14 by a company called Metronaps, which has hit upon the idea of selling sleep to the city that never sleeps. \"Do More With Your Day\", says the business card of self-proclaimed avid napper and Metronaps co-owner, Christopher Lindholst. Lindholst and his business partner - both MBAs - got their idea from watching Manhattan's Masters of the Universe execute nosedives into their briefing notes, or creep off to the loo for 40 winks. A nap's duration, says Lindholst, is crucial. An hour and a half leaves you groggy, and may eat into your night's sleep. Twenty minutes, however, and you feel like Superman, or at least a bit more like him. </p> <p>Dr Jerome Siegel of UCLA's Centre for Sleep Research is unconvinced. He says he doesn't know of any studies that stipulate the optimal nap-time as being 20 minutes, though he allows politely that they might exist. And naps aren't for everyone, he adds. If you're narcoleptic, a nap refreshes. If you have sleep apnoea - or wake often - naps won't provide any benefit. So is Metronaps selling something worthwhile? \"Sure, why not?\" Siegel laughs. </p> <p>Lindholst disputes that he is simply providing for a cost what the subway and colleagues' suit lapels have traditionally supplied free of charge. Metronaps offers superior service. \"Everything here,\" he says, \"from the pods, which are scientifically designed, to the colours, to the lighting, to the lemon-scented towels at the end, has been chosen for power napping.\" </p> <p>When I visited during siesta time the empty room seemed melancholic, like a deserted church. Then two middle-aged men appeared, scouting locations for a science fiction flick they said was being shot on \"a 'Doctor Who' budget\". Then Kevin, a 28-year-old lawyer with a large midtown firm, walked in. He had been working for three days straight. After emerging from the pod, he said: \"If you really want to take a nap and can't do it at the office, this place is great.

  "This is the question which people ask themselves before almost every presidential election: why, when the United States is teeming with brilliant and inspiring people, are its voters so often faced with a choice between two deeply unimpressive men? <p>I would have thought the answer was pretty obvious: because deeply unimpressive men continue to be elected. </p> <p>This year, the American people have been instructed to elect one again. Almost every powerful progressive voice has told them not to vote for the progressive candidate, but to vote instead for The Man Who Isn't There. </p> <p>Ralph Nader may stand for everything the Guardian, the Nation magazine, even Noam Chomsky, claim to support, but all these voices - indeed just about everyone on the left - have been urging the voters in swing states to choose John Kerry. </p> <p>Their argument, of course, is that Kerry is the only candidate who can knock George Bush off his perch. He might be about as inspiring as a parking lot on a wet Sunday in Detroit, but his vacuity is better than the president's aggressive certainties. </p> <p>The contest is so close that if even a few thousand people vote for Nader rather than Kerry in the swing states, it could win the election for Bush. This is why Republicans have been giving money to Nader. </p> <p>So Americans should vote for the Democrats in 2004, and worry about the wider failings of the US political system when the current president is safely out of the way. </p> <p>And their argument has merit. Bush has already launched two unnecessary wars, threatened 40 or 50 nations with armed aggression, ripped up international treaties and domestic regulations, granted corporations a licence to cook the planet, waged a global war against civil liberties and sought to bury that old-fashioned notion that the state should tax the rich and help the poor. The world would certainly be a safer and a better place without him. </p> <p>As a result, a Guardian leader told us last week, these are \"exceptional circumstances Mr Kerry's flaws and limitations are evident; but they are put in the shade by the neo-conservative agenda and catastrophic war-making of Mr Bush\". </p> <p>In an open letter to Ralph Nader in January, the Nation magazine claimed: \"This is the wrong year for you to run: 2004 is not 2000. George W Bush has led us into an illegal pre-emptive war, and his defeat is critical.\" </p> <p>The problem with this argument is that both publications said the same thing about the 2000 elections. The Nation's columnist Eric Alterman blames Al Gore's defeat on Nader's \"megalomania\". Three days before the vote, the Guardian argued that \"... the marginalised Mr Nader cannot win ... Exciting [Al Gore] ain't. A visionary he is not. But he is the safe, wise choice.\" </p> <p>And similar warnings have been issued during almost every presidential election in modern times. Under the US electoral system, which is constructed around patronage, corruption and fear of the media, there will always be exceptional circumstances, because it will always throw up dreadful candidates. </p> <p>Only when the Americans choose a man or woman who is prepared to turn the system upside down and reintroduce democracy to the greatest democracy on earth will these exceptional circumstances come to an end. In choosing the bad rather than the terrible in 2004, in other words, Americans will be voting for a similar choice in 2008. Whereupon they will again be told that they'd better vote for the bad, in case the terrible gets in. </p> <p>Any president who seeks to change this system requires tremendous political courage. He needs to take on the corporations which have bought the elections, and challenge the newspapers and television stations which set the limits of political debate. Kerry, who demonstrated plenty of courage in Vietnam, has shown none whatsoever on the presidential stump. </p> <p>Last week, when the Republicans were questioning his commitment to defence, he announced that \"even knowing what we now know\" he would have voted to give President Bush the authority to attack Iraq. </p> <p>Ten days ago his national security adviser James Rubin told the Washington Post that if Kerry was president he would \"in all probability\" have launched a military attack against Iraq by now. Kerry's ability to raise almost as much money as the Republicans is seen as a triumph for American democracy; but his corporate backers are funding him not because they believe in democracy, but because they believe that he will do what they want. And they are unlikely to be wrong. When Kerry gets his orders, he reports for duty. </p> <p>The idea that this frightened, flinching man would oversee the necessary democratic revolution is preposterous. </p> <p>He has made the system work for him by working for the system. He knows that as soon as he turns against it, it will destroy him. What else does he have to fall back on? Charisma? Popular enthusiasm? </p> <p>He's no Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. A vote for Kerry is not just a vote against George Bush. It is a vote for the survival of the system which made Bush happen. </p> <p>I'm not an unhesitating fan of Ralph Nader's - I believe that some of his positions on trade, for example, are wrong - but no one could deny that he possesses courage. </p> <p>His decision to stand in November, when even his former supporters are telling him not to, is as brave as it is foolhardy. He has spent his working life fighting the corporations and being attacked in the media. </p> <p>This month he did something no other US politician has dared to do, and took on the Anti-Defamation League, the organisation which smears opponents of Israeli policy as anti-semites. </p> <p>He won't be elected in November, of course, but that's not the point. The point is that if you want to change a system, you have to start now, rather than in some endlessly deferred future. And the better Nader does, the faster the campaign for change will grow. </p> <p>The Nation claims that Nader would have \"a far more productive impact\" as \"a public citizen fighting for open debates and rallying voters to support progressive Democrats\". </p> <p>But what possible incentive would the Democrats have to listen to him? He has influence over these cowering creatures only while they are afraid that he might take their votes. </p> <p>None of this is to suggest that there is no difference between Kerry and Bush. Where Bush is active, Kerry is passive. </p> <p>He wants to maintain massive levels of defence spending, but, despite his efforts to assure the media that he is as mad as Bush, he would probably be more reluctant to attack other nations. </p> <p>He wants to cut taxes, but he is less willing to wage war on health and education. He wants to hold down the price of oil, but doesn't want to help the corporations open up the Arctic Wildlife Refuge. </p> <p>The question is whether this difference is sufficient to justify the abandonment of the only current electoral attempt to democratise the US political system. </p> <p>I don't believe it is. Progressives on both sides of the Atlantic are asking American voters to sacrifice liberty for security, and democracy for expediency. The voters should ignore them. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.monbiot.com\">www.monbiot.com</a></p>",
  "The victory of Venezuela's leftwing president, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, in a national referendum on his rule was greeted with scepticism both at home and abroad. <p>In the Caracas press, dominated by the country's opposition movement, there is much wailing and gnashing of teeth, not to mention a hefty portion of sour grapes. Writing in the independent daily <a href=\"http://www.elmundo.com.ve/Politica/default20040816.asp\">El Mundo (Spanish)</a>, the commentator <b>Isa Dobles</b> opens her piece positively enough. She writes: \"Yesterday was a day of glory. Enormous numbers took to the streets to immerse themselves in democracy.

Is this not just another perverse strategy by Ch\u00e1vez?\"</p> <p><b>Alberto Jord\u00e1n Hern\u00e1ndez</b> in <a href=\"http://opinion.eluniversal.com/2004/08/17/opi_art_17490C.shtml\">El Universal (Spanish)</a> is more mild-mannered, but the message is the same. \"It should be enough just to mention the fraudulent manipulation of the electoral register, the replacement of electoral officials not considered 'effective' and the shameless operation which left Venezuelans waiting up to 12 hours in endless queues,\" he writes, before concluding - contrary to the findings of the Carter Centre and the Organisation of American States - that the whole thing was a con.</p> <p>Relations between Ch\u00e1vez and his rightwing counterpart Alvaro Uribe in neighbouring Colombia have not been easy, and Colombia's only national daily, <a href=\"http://eltiempo.terra.com.co/opinion/colopi_new/pedromedellintorres/ARTICULO-WEB-_NOTA_INTERIOR-1768391.html\">El Tiempo (Spanish)</a> is reluctant to endorse the election result, raising the question of whether Ch\u00e1vez's stated policies are, in fact, a smokescreen behind which he is centralising power in his own hands and muddying the separation of the legislature and the judiciary. </p> <p>In an <a href=\"http://eltiempo.terra.com.co/inte/latin/2004-08-16/ARTICULO-WEB-_NOTA_INTERIOR-1768215.html\">analysis piece (Spanish)</a>, the paper's deputy editor, <b>Rodrigo Pardo</b>, warns that there are difficult times ahead for \"a profoundly divided country\". The paper does, however, conclude in an editorial that \"maybe there is something our fragile democracy can learn from the Venezuelan experience\".</p> <p>In Brazil, the national daily <a href=\"http://oglobo.globo.com/online/default.asp\">O Globo (Portuguese)</a> ignores the story on its comment pages, but does give some prominence to comments by its own country's leftwing president, Luis Inacio Lula da Silva, in which he congratulates Ch\u00e1vez and calls on his supporters to be \"humble and serene\" in victory.</p> <p>Writing in Mexico's <a href=\" http://www.jornada.unam.mx/017a1pol.php?origen=opinion.php&amp;fly=1\">La Jornada (Spanish)</a> daily, <b>Luis Hern\u00e1ndez Navarro</b> uses a baseball analogy to describe Ch\u00e1vez's victory as a \"home run\" in which he \"hit the ball out of the ground and landed plum on the White House lawn\". </p> <p>He concludes: \"The coup attempts failed, the general strikes and recall referendum failed ... and the [opposition] Democratic Coordinator movement is left today with just two options: seek to re-immerse itself in the democratic process or die.\"</p> <p>In the United States itself, the major newspapers give prominent coverage to the referendum result, but, in terms of opinion, they seem to be following the White House line in declining to comment for the time being. </p> <p>Not so in Spain, where both left and right leaning papers try to look beyond the implications for Ch\u00e1vez himself. <a href=\"http://www.abc.es/abc/pg040817/prensa/noticias/Opinion/Editoriales/200408/17/NAC-OPI-012.asp\">ABC (Spanish)</a> is scathing. In an editorial entitled Venezuela, Divided by Ch\u00e1vez, the paper lays the blame for the country's political crisis firmly at his feet. \"The real question is whether Ch\u00e1vez's post-communist regime is itself a farce, and whether any amount of effort to sustain it will eventually lead to the socioeconomic collapse of the country,\" the paper says.</p> <p>\"For now, Ch\u00e1vez can count on high oil prices, which came to his help in organising his electoral campaign. But, one day, the massed poor who live in the hillsides around Caracas and who are the main source of his strength, will come down to the Miraflores [presidential] palace not to congratulate him like last night, but to reclaim the thousands of millions of dollars in oil wealth that have evaporated in the enormous inefficiency of this Bolivarian illusion Ch\u00e1vez calls revolution.\"</p> <p>An editorial in <a href=\"http://www.elpais.es/articuloCompleto.html?d_date=20040817&amp;xref=20040817elpepiopi_1&amp;type=Tes&amp;anchor=elpporopi\">El Pa\u00eds (Spanish)</a> takes a similar but gentler line. \"The real question is whether the referendum will allow the country to emerge from the deep political and social crisis in which it has been mired for the past two years,\" the paper says, before asserting that \"the first signs suggest that despite the impressive victory of the Venezuelan president over his opponents - his eighth at the polls in less than six years - that situation is not about to resolve itself\". </p> <p>\"Over the past few years, and at times on the edge of an abyss of economic paralysis and social unrest, Venezuelans have wasted a large part of their energies in polemics over the regime installed by the former parachutist and coup leader. For the opposition, the time has come to reorganise itself for the parliamentary elections next year, and for all Venezuelans - pro or anti-Ch\u00e1vez - it is an opportunity to rescue their country from a prostrate position in which more than two thirds of the population are touched by poverty despite the river of money that has flowed from the oil bonanza,\" El Pa\u00eds adds.</p>",
  "<p>Thank you for taking time from your summer school to listen to my reflections on the state of education debate in our country. The opportunities for gifted and talented young people symbolise much that is changing in our education system, and I look forward to hearing from you your reflections on the summer school, and the work of the national academy, who are doing so much to take forward provision for you.</p> <p>I wanted to talk to you today because August is a good time to reflect on the state of our education system. On Thursday we get the A-level results; a week today the test results for 11-year-olds; on Thursday week the GCSE results.</p> <p>These figures are not the only guide to the health of our education system. Yet it is in August that scrutiny is often greatest, and it sets the tone for the year. </p> <p>The statistics for achievement at 11 over the last 10 years, and at 16 and 18 over the last 30 years, show that there is an education revolution underway in our country; it is an education revolution that is opening up educational opportunity to middle England for the first time; it is an education revolution built on the hard work of teachers, headteachers, support staff and governors; and it is an education revolution that is a force for massive economic and social change. </p> <p>But like any revolution, there are those who want to defend the old order of things. Wider and wider educational achievement is a challenge - for those who see danger in meritocracy, who see snakes and not just ladders in the educational rise of middle England. That is why the annual debate about test and exam results is so important. </p> <p>Today I want to put this debate in its proper context. The context of myths about education that mark out this country; myths that feed a culture where \"too clever by half\" is a good put-down, where \"boffin\" is a term of abuse; myths that stand in the way of the progress for hard-working pupils and families for whom education is a one-off chance to break into the winners' circle; myths that put up barriers of birth not merit to the rise of hard working pupils from all over the country.</p> <p><strong>The facts on rising achievement</strong><br></p> <p>Let me first set out the facts on pupil achievement as we know them from the August test and exam series. Since 1997:<br></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> at age 11, primary school reforms have ensured that over 100,000 more children now read, write and count to high standard<br> </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> at age 16, we have the best ever results at GCSE, with the percentage of students achieving five or more good grades increasing from about 45% in 1997 to 53% last year; that means an extra 65,000 students getting a passport into further study<br></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> and at age 18, of students who take post-16 qualifications, the proportion gaining the equivalent of three A-levels has risen from 61% to 71% last year; this is an extra 50,000 students. </p> <p>Over a 30-year period the figures are even more striking:<br></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> the number of students with the equivalent of five good GCSEs up from 150,000 in 1973 to 330,000 last year<br></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> the number of students achieving the equivalent of two A-levels up from 78,000 to 240,000<br></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> the total number of UK students in higher education up from 450,000 to 1,150,000.<br></p> <p>For girls, the picture over a 30-year period is remarkable. Since the introduction of mass comprehensive education girls have been the biggest gainers in terms of educational achievement. From a position 30 years ago where boys achievement outstripped girls, today the position is the reverse:<br></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> from 75,000 boys and 73,000 girls achieving the equivalent of five good GCSEs in 1973, up to 150,000 boys but 180,000 girls did so last year<br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> and from 44,000 boys and 34,000 girls with the equivalent of two A-levels in 1973, up to 110,000 boys but 130,000 girls did so last year.</p> <p>The gains in educational achievement have been greatest in the middle of the socio economic spectrum. Many of the parents of these successful pupils did not go to university themselves, but they are working hard to give their children the opportunities they never had. But, in addition since 1997, we have also seen some striking gains in the lowest income groups:<br></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> in schools with over 50% of students receiving free school meals the average rate of improvement at GCSE since 1997 is double that of schools with less that 5% of students receiving free school meals<br></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> the national 8% increase in students achieving five good grades at GCSE was been surpassed in urban areas by rises last year of 11% in London, 13% in Manchester and 14% in Birmingham<br></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> and at the end of primary school, the proportion of students achieving the expected level in English, maths and science has increased at double the rate of improvement in schools with over 40% of students receiving free school meals compared to those with less that 5%.<br></p> <p>For ethnic minorities there is also a very significant picture. Contrary to some commentary, it is not the case that ethnic minorities are at the bottom of the educational heap:<br></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Chinese students are the highest achievers in our education system, with almost three quarters achieving five good GCSEs last year compared to over half our students nationally<br></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Indian pupils and pupils of mixed white and Asian heritage consistently achieve above the national average at all levels<br></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> and students from Black Caribbean communities, though still significantly behind, achieved the second fastest rate of improvement at GCSE last year, with achievement up by nearly four percentage points.<br></p> <p>So these are the facts as recorded in tests and exams. They seem to show real progress, despite continued problems that I do not in any way seek to underestimate. Yet every August the progress in achievement brings howls of anguish as well as tears of joy. </p> <p>In truth the great education debate every August more and more resembles a pantomime not a discussion. You know the script:<br></p> <p>Parents and pupils celebrate their results; relatives and neighbours are proud; local newspapers say: \"haven't they done well.\"</p> <p>And then there is a resounding chorus from self-appointed experts who shout: \"Oh no they haven't done well at all; things aren't what they used to be; it's the exams which have got easier not the standards of achievement that have risen.\"</p> <p>We must be the only country in the world where a spokesman for the opposition could believe it is an effective election gambit to say he would be proud to preside over an education system in which standards of attainment fall and more pupils fail. </p> <p>How to explain this? In his commencement address at Yale University in 1961, President John F Kennedy said that \"the great enemy of the truth is very often not the lie...but the myth...the comfort of opinion without the discomfort of thought\". This is what we face today, and it is what I want to challenge.</p> <p><strong>The six myths</strong><br> </p> <p>There are six educational myths that perpetuate a debilitating cycle of low aspiration and educational confusion and underachievement. Each helps to maintain a fiction that the only successful education system is one where the majority fail to achieve - more or less the system which existed in the 1950s or 1960s, and which many of our critics see as a model.</p> <p>The first myth is that because there is an unchanging distribution and level of intelligence and aptitude, there should therefore be an unchanging distribution and level of educational achievement.</p> <p>This myth, like the others, is deepseated. It relies on two confusions:<br></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> the confusion between different types of intelligence. It is a truism that different people are good at different things. The American scholar Howard Gardener has identified eight different types of intelligence, from logical-mathematical to musical. And because different people are good at different things, it is silly to rely on a single metric of aptitude in measuring achievement. Increasingly our tests and exams are focusing on a broader range of intellectual competence than was traditionally measured by conventional IQ tests. For example, students are asked to apply knowledge as well as recall it. The result is that more of our youngsters are able to show what they are capable of.<br></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> there is also the confusion between intelligence or aptitude, and achievement. Whatever your potential, it is its realisation that is the vital task of education. And education systems can be more or less successful at fulfilling potential. So even with a given distribution of aptitudes, there is plenty of scope for education to become more successful at realising potential. For example, there are now an increasing range of teaching strategies that can substantially accelerate rates of learning and help students acquire a broader range of independent learning skills.</p> <p>My contention is not that today's students are born cleverer than their parents; it is that schools and teachers are getting better at getting the best out of them.</p> <p>The second myth is that fairness is the enemy of excellence. But why should this be so?</p> <p>First, there is nothing in mass achievement that holds back excellent performance; in fact it widens the talent pool from which best performers are drawn and increases competition for top places. The result is not only a more open society, but also one where the average standard of achievement rises.</p> <p>Second, excellence can be used as a locomotive for systemic improvement. This is the experience of specialist schools and the Excellence in Cities programme in education. They demonstrate that by using best practice to generate improvement across a network of schools excellence becomes a resource for a fairer system. </p> <p>It is profoundly wrong to assume that a glass ceiling on high achievement presents the only path to high equity. But it is equally misguided to see the drive to help more pupils achieve as the enemy of high performance. Excellence should be the ally of equity not its enemy.</p> <p>The third myth is that education cannot overcome poverty. There is no question that children growing up in secure housing with facilities for homework and support for extra-curricula activities have an in-built advantage when it comes to educational achievement. But we should never fall for the lie that middle and lower income families without a history of educational achievement do not want the best for their children; nor should we fall for the \"poverty of aspiration\" that Ernest Bevin diagnosed in the 1940s.</p> <p>The barriers to achievement presented by low income are just that - barriers; and it is the job of the education system to overcome them. The correlation between low income and low achievement is a challenge to provision. And the performance of some secondary schools in our most challenging areas show what education can do:<br></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Selly Park girls school in Birmingham, with over 50% of students eligible for free school meals, has made striking improvements. From just 27% of students getting five good GCSEs in 1996 up to 82% last year<br></p> <p>- and Loxford school of science and technology in Ilford, East London, with over 40% of students eligible for free school meals, is also bucking the national trend: from 31% of students achieving five good GCSEs in 1997 to 65% last year.<br> </p> <p>The fourth myth is that a mass public service like education, precisely because it has to cater for all talents and all interests, can never deliver the sort of personalised help that is offered in the private sector. Mass state education is condemned by the lowest common denominator. </p> <p>Some of you may have felt the justice of this criticism in the past. I have been told by some of our most gifted children that they have simply been bored at school. But that is not inevitable. It is precisely the challenge of universal systems to deliver for the individual, to put the individual at the centre. That is the promise of what I call personalised learning - not pupils learning on their own but every pupil with the curriculum and teaching suited to the needs, interests and aptitudes. And the extraordinary development of gifted and talent provision over the last five years is testimony to what is possible:<br></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> the gifted and talented programme now reaches over 150,000 students in 2000 maintained primary and 1000 maintained secondary schools<br></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> we now expect there to be a trained Gifted and Talented co-ordinator in every participating school, ensuring that students receive a tailored teaching and learning programme<br></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> and the National Academy for Gifted and Talented Youth at Warwick University, now delivers a range of learning opportunities to the 33,000 members of its Student Academy, of whom over a thousand will be participating in this year's summer schools at Warwick, Lancaster, Exeter, Durham, York, Canterbury and here at Imperial.<br> </p> <p>The fifth myth is that however compelling the logic for improved provision, the education system is so riven by vested interests that it cannot deliver progress. </p> <p>Too often, there is easy grist provided for this mill. But credit is needed where it is due. I believe there is increasing recognition in the trade unions representing all those involved in the education system that unless they work to retain the confidence of the public then all their aspirations for their members will come to nought. I base this assertion on two pieces of evidence:<br></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> the cooperation to bring new flexibility to the deployment of school staff, focussing teachers on teaching and freeing them up from non-teaching tasks, has shown both the teacher and the support staff trade unions in a good light; they are committed to workforce reform because it is right for their members and right for pupils<br></p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> the agreement with the teacher unions to restructure the upper pay scale, so that the highest rewards for classroom teaching are for excellence, is further proof of their commitment to think in new ways about how to drive up standards for all pupils. It shows that, even in traditionally confrontational areas such as teachers pay, a basis is being found for constructive dialogue and reform.</p> <p>I believe we have a historic opportunity to fashion a radical consensus within the education system about the need for reform; that is the purpose of the five-year strategy published by Charles Clarke in July; it has at its heart a major commitment to staff development, to more freedom and independence for headteachers and to greater personalisation for students so that their needs and talents are put at centre of everything we do.</p> <p>The strategy is backed by significant investment. Money is no guarantee of improvement, but wise investment in education will reap dividends.</p> <p>The sixth myth, the biggest myth of all, the myth that underpins all the others, is the myth that in the famous phrase of Kingsley Amis in the 1950s, \"more will mean worse\", that more education for more people will mean lower standards, that more people getting more qualifications will mean worse qualifications. This is the myth that underpins all the allegations that fly around in August: that anyone can get an A, that exams used to be tougher, that university graduates cannot write or count, that new-fangled subjects like psychology are easy.</p> <p>There is long tradition standing behind this myth. The 18th century writer Bernard Mandeville said that education would \"initiate the poor into a life of crime, sloth and discontent, and permanently incapacitate them for hard, honest labour\". Disraeli's 19th century reformism was met with the argument that education would be wasted on the masses. It was a sentiment repeated when Balfour brought in the 1902 Education Act. And it is echoed today when the need for 50% of young people to go into higher education is questioned.</p> <p>The premise is simple. Educational achievement is preordained at birth. So a greater number of young people cannot be expected to achieve at the level previously reserved for the elite. And if more are doing so, then it is because the exams are getting easier or the standards being dropped, not the teaching and learning getting better. This is the argument I think it is so important to refute.</p> <p><strong>More Does not Mean Worse</strong><br></p> <p>I have no interest in handing out certificates to people who do not deserve them; I have no interest in pretending to young people that they are capable of something when they clearly are not. But rejecting the myth that more means worse does not mean a culture of prizes for all. My view is that pupils who reach a high standard should be recognised with high results. I will address in a moment recognition of the most able. Those who don't reach the standard should not get the grade. Yet unlike my opponents, I do not believe that there will only ever be a set number of pupils capable of doing well.</p> <p>The allegation that the government is wilfully encouraging or allowing the misrepresentation of student achievement is a very serious one. So I want to go through the different threads of this allegation very carefully.</p> <p>First, there is the suggestion that the questions, marks or grades reflect political imperatives. This is completely untrue. The content and standards of public examinations are the responsibility of the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority, which is an independent organisation established by law. It regulates the awarding bodies. Neither ministers nor my department have powers to intervene in the marking, grading and moderating of public exams. </p> <p>Second, that changes to course structure, notably the shift to modular studies or the use of coursework, are somehow suspect. Yet the key to the rigour and demand of any qualification is the curriculum content and the method of assessment. And exactly the same standard is applied to qualifications using modular as to terminal exams. The process by which grades are set is the same. The level of challenge is the same. And Ofsted's 1999 report on modular A-levels confirmed that standards in modular and linear syllabuses had been consistent. Modular qualifications offer students regular feedback on their work to help them make progress; but this does not make the degree of challenge easier; nor does it substitute for end of course \"synoptic\" papers, which must count for at least 20% of the course.</p> <p>Third, that standards are being allowed to slip even though the process is independent and the course structure is not flawed. The current system for comparing standards over time was introduced in 1987. It seeks to ensure that any grade given to a candidate in one year is comparable with what they might achieve had they sat the same exam in an earlier year. Two independent studies in the last decade have found no evidence of \"dumbing down\". But there is always need for vigilance. That is why the QCA has established an independent committee, chaired by Barry McGaw, of the OECD, to review and advise them on standards. This will report for the first time in the autumn.</p> <p>Fourth, that even if standards are not being allowed to slip, any system in which the vast majority of people pass must be a farce; but in fact Cambridge University report that less than 1% of students fail to get a degree in their finals. No one pretends that standards are slipping at Cambridge.</p> <p>The fifth allegation is that a system where one in five entrants gets an A is by definition failing in its functions. Leave to one side for the moment the point that only around one in 20 A-level candidates gets As in each of the six modules that make up an A-level, or that in an age cohort of over half a million just 22,000 got three A grades last year. Universities and employers do need a means to select the highest achievers. But my argument is that that need is no basis for marking down the successful efforts of an increasing number of candidates. </p> <p>I have a strong interest in developing a 14-19 education system that stretches achievement at every level of the ability range. For our most able youngsters, we are now discussing how to recognise distinctive achievement. The Tomlinson Inquiry into the future of 14-19 education is going to come forward with a range of ways to recognise top achievement. Good. The answer to rising numbers of A grades is not to shift the goalposts so more people are downgraded, but instead to create new opportunities for the most able young people to distinguish themselves. Vigilance and reform, yes; myth-making, no.<br></p> <p><strong>A challenge to the myth makers</strong><br> </p> <p>This argument for reform contains within it a challenge to the myth makers who talk down educational achievement every summer. When the facts say teaching standards are rising; when the facts confirm the rigour of tests and exams; when the facts show that the growth in pupils doing well comes from middle England families; the only conclusion we can draw when commentators talk of \"dumbing down\" is that they believe middle England has neither the brains nor the talent to do well. </p> <p>So my message to them is simple: stop saying pupils from middle England haven't got the brains to do well at school. Stop saying to the children of those who have not gone to university in the past, who live from Plymouth to Redditch to Sunderland, that there is a charmed circle of educational achievement and it has big Keep Out signs all around it. Stop saying to all those girls who were previously failing to achieve as well as their male peers that their results now overestimate their potential. </p> <p>The government's fight is on behalf of hard-earned merit not easy prizes. We stand for success based on worth not birth. And we will not be distracted from building wider educational opportunities by those who see a danger in meritocracy.</p> <p>Our job is to be vigilant on behalf of every student, vigilant in organising the independent setting of standards, vigilant in ensuring that curriculum and teaching is stretching and testing. But when that merit is being shown day in day out in schools right across middle England, our job is to stand up for that merit and for that achievement. </p> <p>We know that the 21st century demands citizens and employees with more knowledge not less, more skills not less, more creativity not less. The evidence is that despite the problems that still afflict too many pupils in too many schools, we are getting better as a country at getting the best out of our young people. We should applaud them and applaud their schools. </p> <p>This is an argument about our future as a country - open and meritocratic or closed and hidebound. It is an argument that holds out a better future for each and every one of you, and I thank you for being such powerful emblems of what is possible.</p>",
  "Most people can remember the Fiji coup four years ago, when George Speight - a flogger of pyramid schemes with the build and shaved head of a prop forward - took the country's government hostage for two months. <p>The whiff of violence and trouble in a Pacific paradise gave worldwide media attention to the standoff, but since then few have shown much interest in the country's fate. A friend summed up the situation a few weeks ago by wondering: \"Isn't everything there back to normal?\" </p> <p>Well, to a point. Things in Fiji are back to normal now, but it is a form of normality where democracy and respect for the rule of law often come second to ethnic chauvinism. </p> <p>When British colonialists turned Fiji into a sugar plantation in the 19th century, they were dismayed at the refusal of the natives to do the work that they had no intention of doing themselves. To help things along, Her Majesty's government brought 60,000 Indians to the Pacific on exploitative contracts which these days would see it done for people smuggling. </p> <p>That movement of labour is at the bottom of Fiji's ethnic problems. Indo-Fijians make up 44% of the population and 51% are indigenous Melanesians, with Europeans and Asians making up most of the balance. The landowners are all indigenous, the mercantile classes Indo-Fijian, and the poor a mixture of both. </p> <p>There is little love lost between the two majority groups. Many indigenous Fijians believe the Indo-Fijians are foreign colonialists bent on stealing their country; many Indo-Fijians believe the Melanesians are feckless and violent. </p> <p>Twice in the past 20 years the Fiji Labour party, an officially multiracial party dominated by Indo-Fijians, has won power. Both times, a coup has restored the status quo within a matter of months. </p> <p>Back in 1987, when the FLP first made it to office, Indo-Fijians made up a slim minority of the country. But two coups and a new constitution, slanted in favour of the islanders, reweighted the demographic balance during the 1990s, as thousands of Indo-Fijians upped and left for an easier life in Australia or New Zealand. </p> <p>Even so, when the main discriminatory aspects of the constitution were rubbed out in 1997, the first elections held under the new rules again returned the FLP to power with a landslide under the country's first Indo-Fijian prime minister, Mahendra Chaudhry. </p> <p>A year later, the Speight coup overturned this and restored Melanesian rule. The army intervened to end the hostage crisis, and the world acquiesced as Chaudhry was summarily removed as prime minister and replaced by indigenous banker Laisenia Qarase. A year later, the general election was won by Qarase's United Fiji party (SDL) with the slenderest of majorities. </p> <p>Qarase knows how to dress up his government's chauvinism in more fetching anti-colonialist colours. </p> <p>After the country's vice-president Ratu Jope Seniloli was jailed earlier this month for treason over his role in the Speight coup, Qarase blamed the courts: \"The conviction shows that the western law ignores the cultural problems,\" he explained. Presumably a law which paid proper attention to \"cultural problems\" would have no argument with an anti-democratic coup founded on ethnic hatred and corruption. </p> <p>The connections between Seniloli and Speight were not merely incidental. The deputy president is Ratu, or leader, of Speight's clan, and the coup leader did Seniloli the honour of phoning him on the morning of the coup to say that everything was going to plan. The next day, while Chaudhry and his government were being held hostage in the parliament complex, Seniloli turned up to swear in Speight's indigenous government. </p> <p>But Seniloli's imprisonment on a four-year term has still engendered breast beating among the Melanesians who run Fiji. There have been calls for an official pardon from the highest levels, and local police are on the alert for plans to instigate riots to bring about the vice-president's release. In a sign of popular anger in the country, two Hindu temples have been vandalised in the past week. </p> <p>Compare Fiji to the other relics of colonialism scattered around the Pacific, and you have to wonder what the indigenous Fijians have got to complain about. </p> <p>The cabinet's only Indo-Fijian, George Shiu Raj, holds the low-level multi-ethnic affairs portfolio. Despite three years of legal challenges to bring the government into line with the 1997 constitution, which guarantees cabinet representation for all major parties, the FLP is still consigned to the status of permanent opposition. </p> <p>Melanesians still own nearly all the country's agricultural land and charge crippling rents to the Indo-Fijian sugar cane farmers on whom the country's economy depends. Many of these landowners feel wealthy enough to spare their rents and let the land lie fallow out of spite, forcing the Indo-Fijian farmers to seek work in the slums growing at the fringes of the country's main cities. </p> <p>It all looks strikingly like the sort of government that Speight would have been happy with, and, to many in Fiji, it seems that his crime was one of presentation, rather than absolute morality. To this way of thinking, there is no problem with rigging politics to exclude half of Fiji's population from government, as long as it is done discreetly enough that the rest of the world does not notice.</p>",
  "Speculation that Ayad Allawi, Iraq's interim prime minister, has been invited to speak at next month's Labour party conference has exacerbated the party's divisions over the war. <p>Two members of the National Executive Committee (NEC), Mark Seddon and Ann Black, have written to colleagues protesting about the move, while the grassroots Labour Against the War group is urging activists to lobby MPs and ministers against it.</p> <p>Mr Seddon today accused Tony Blair of trying to bounce the party into welcoming Mr Allawi at its conference, after the decision of who to invite was held over at the last meeting of the NEC in late July. </p> <p>The NEC is not set to meet again until the run-up to conference, after its agenda has been set.</p> <p>\"The Labour party has been bounced,\" he told Guardian Unlimited. \"Tony Blair seems to regard the Labour party as his personal property.</p> <p>\"Given all the controversy surrounding Mr Allawi I'd like to see us invite someone senior from the Democrat party, perhaps John Kerry.\"</p> <p>Ms Black, meanwhile, said: \"This is the last conference before a general election and most people want to put Iraq behind them and unite around Labour's positive domestic agenda. It's hard to see how Mr Allawi's presence will help that.</p> <p>\"I fear that it will simply reopen divisions that many people are trying to heal.\"</p> <p>An email sent out to Labour party activists by Labour Against the War echoes Mr Seddon's concern about Mr Allawi's record, describing him as \"one of a US-backed clique of secular Iraqis ... [who is] equally mistrusted by everyone in Iraq's multifarious population.\"</p> <p>The group's treasurer, left-wing Labour MP Jeremy Corbyn, has also written to Mr Blair in protest, urging him to understand that any such invitation to Mr Allawi will be \"seen as an insult to many around the country\".</p> <p>He asks the prime minister to \"think again and assure me that no such invitation is going to be issued by you or the party\".</p> <p>As well as calling on party members to lobby MPs and ministers, the group is also expected to urge local Labour parties to submit emergency motions to the conference in protest.</p> <p>The Labour party has refused to confirm that Mr Allawi has been invited to its September conference in Brighton, stating that guest speakers are not usually announced so far in advance for security reasons.</p> <p>If the interim prime minister does attend the conference he will be following in illustrious footsteps, the former American and South African presidents Bill Clinton and Nelson Mandela have both addressed the gathering, as did Afghanistan's interim leader, Hamid Karzai.</p>",
  "Welcome to the Wrap, Guardian Unlimited's round-up of the best of the day's papers. <p><b>THREE MISSING IN FLASH FLOODS</b></p> <p>Evidently glad to have a real news story on their hands, the broadsheets jostle to present the most dramatic photo of the flash floods which devastated the Cornish town of Boscastle yesterday. The Times has an aerial shot of a helicopter circling the town of grey slate roofs, with a torrent of water streaming down the high street. Inside, a 3D graphic shows how the convergence of three valleys \"in a deep coomb\" at Boscastle, near Tintagel on the north coast of Cornwall, led to the sudden and devastating floods. Rescue services told the paper that up to 1,000 people were affected by the floods, many trapped on roofs, up trees and in cars.</p> <p>The Guardian shows a young man and woman being winched up from a roof as the flood waters swirl round the town. It says that at one point a three metre wave of water rushed down the town's streets, and that more than 30 cars were washed out into the harbour. The town's bridge and harbour wall were badly damaged. </p> <p>Winner by a nose in the photo competition is the Telegraph, which devotes the width of its front page to a street of pretty pastel coloured houses - Boscastle is a popular tourist town - facing onto what appears to be a riverbed, but is in fact the town centre. In the middle of the frame four cars are piled one on top of the other, where the floodwaters have dashed them against an outhouse. The report says three people are known to be missing, although the police added that there was, understandably, \"great confusion\".</p> <p>Boscastle may take some heart from the arrival on the scene of John Prescott, who the Guardian says is on his way to the area. Over the weekend, the deputy PM pulled a concussed canoeist out of a mountain river in Snowdonia, though he has played down the incident.</p> <p>The Independent follows up the report with a piece on those celebrity saviours in full; it recalls a somewhat over-spun rescue by Tony Blair, later dismissed as \"absurd\" by its supposed beneficiary, and the drunken man hauled from a canal by Paddy Ashdown, who remarked soggily to his saviour: \"Oh God, my fags are all wet.\"</p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/weather/Story/0,2763,1284777,00.html\">Three missing as flood hits village</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Politics/backbench/story/0,14158,1284631,00.html\">Prescott secures white water vote</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml;sessionid=LJ5T4NTLRB5PZQFIQMGCNAGAVCBQUJVC?xml=/news/2004/08/17/ustorm.xml&amp;sSheet=/portal/2004/08/17/ixportaltop.html\">Telegraph: Prescott joins flood rescue operation</a></p> <p><b>CHAVEZ RETURNED ON HIGHEST EVER TURNOUT</b></p> <p>The FT devotes its front page picture not to Boscastle but to Caracas in Venezuela, where a triumphant President Hugo Chavez won his recall referendum yesterday.</p> <p>Its headline, \"Chavez victory eases pressure on oil prices\", explains why the vote matters to the FT, but is incidentally the same tack taken by the Guardian. Both papers say the opposition has alleged fraud, even though the Organisation of American States and the Carter Centre endorsed the result. The FT says this will continue to trouble the oil markets as \"the unpredictable politics of the world's fifth biggest oil exporter\" lead to worries about further political instability</p> <p>The Guardian is more optimistic. It says that turnout - at 8.5m from an electorate of 14m - was lower than billed yesterday; early figures put it at 80%. But it is still the country's highest ever, and with 94.4% of the ballots counted, President Chavez emerged with 58.25% of the vote.</p> <p>The paper's leader alludes to Mr Chavez's contention that much of the opposition against him is stirred up by Washington. \"It was, surely, a great victory for democracy ... of the kind for which George Bush is striving throughout the world.\" It goes on to gently rubbish suggestions that Mr Chavez is undemocratic because he courts the poor, saying that \"to win votes by embarking on policies that benefit the majority of voters is hardly a sensation in most democratic societies, including our own.\" </p> <p>The Telegraph is firmly in the other camp. It focuses on disturbances in Caracas after the result was announced, saying Chavez supporters fired on opposition protestors. Its leader says Chavez has run the Venezuelan oil industry into the ground - a claim the Guardian leader explicitly contradicts - and frets about Mr Chavez's avowed wish to \"export the revolution\". It is, says the Telegraph, \"dangerous enough at home; its export would be bloodier\".</p> <p>Lastly, Tariq Ali makes a striking claim in the Independent. \"The turn-out in Venezuela on Sunday was huge; 94.9% of the electorate voted in the recall referendum.\" You'll remember that number from all the other reports as the amount of votes so far counted, not the turnout. Ali goes on to recount his conversations with Chavez, in which the president explains his undogmatic policy of helping the poor without embracing Marxism, but his opening gambit hardly inspires confidence.</p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/venezuela/story/0,12716,1284671,00.html\">Venezuela votes for Chavez amid cries of foul play</a><br> * <a href=\"http://news.ft.com/cms/s/ae8edadc-ef05-11d8-848a-00000e2511c8.html\">FT: Chavez success helps to ease pressure on oil</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml;sessionid=LJ5T4NTLRB5PZQFIQMGCNAGAVCBQUJVC?xml=/opinion/2004/08/17/dl1702.xml&amp;sSheet=/portal/2004/08/17/ixportal.html\">Telegraph: Venezuelan exports</a></p> <p><b>US WITHDRAWS TROOPS FROM EUROPE AND ASIA</b></p> <p>Poor Dubya. President Bush can't seem to do anything this week without allegations of cynical vote-grabbing. Yesterday it was comforting victims of hurricane Charley, today it's announcing that 70,000 military personnel, and a further 100,000 civilian employees, are to be withdrawn from \"cold war\" arenas in Asia and Europe and redeployed, many of them operating from bases in the US.</p> <p>The Independent quotes the Democrat general Wesley Clark, who said the timing seemed \"politically motivated rather than designed to strengthen our national security.\"</p> <p>In his speech, Mr Bush said the \"world has changed a great deal and our posture must change with it,\" and that the redeployment would make US forces \"more agile and flexible\". </p> <p>The FT's leader sums up what it sees as the import of the move in the headline to its leader: \"The empire moves its frontiers\". In a broad-ranging piece, which does not neglect the decision by the Roman emperor Honorius to remove his troops from Britain in the early fifth century, the FT says it is logical to bring an end to military dispositions designed for the cold war. \"It makes little sense to keep two of the US army's ten armoured divisions stationed in the Bavarian forest.\"</p> <p>But this is not, it says, \"a retreat from empire\". The real issue, says the paper, is that the US has so many troops committed to Iraq and Afghanistan that it must change its attitude. Indeed, the biggest problem is that the US has too few soldiers, making this a case of \"rearranging the deck chairs\". John Kerry, it notes approvingly, has promised to recruit 40,000 new soldiers.</p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/usa/story/0,12271,1284627,00.html\">US to pull back troops from Asia and Europe</a><br> * <a href=\"http://news.independent.co.uk/world/americas/story.jsp?story=552288\">Independent: Bush orders exodus of troops in US and Asia</a></p> <p><b>SADR HOLDING OUT IN NAJAF</b></p> <p>The Independent goes its own way, as is often the case.

But the paper reports that Iraqi police are continuing to intimidate journalists in the city, and says an attempt to draw Mr Sadr's people into political discussions in Baghdad has come to nothing. </p> <p>There is a little comfort to be gleaned from the Guardian's report: the headline reads \"Baghdad tries new Najaf peace bid\", which is the first time the Wrap has seen \"Baghdad\" used to mean \"the Iraqi government\" since the war.</p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1284724,00.html\">Baghdad tries new Najaf peace bid</a><br> * <a href=\"http://news.independent.co.uk/world/middle_east/story.jsp?story=552289\">Independent: Najaf: City of defiance</a></p> <p> <b>UNINVITED TUTU DISRUPTS DIVING IN ATHENS</b></p> <p>After yesterday's gloomfest, the papers are starting to develop a bit of Olympic spirit.

  "After a hard night of celebration, which saw bands of supporters of President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez traversing the capital in pick-up trucks and cars, beeping horns and waving red flags, many Venezuelans simply wanted to get home. <p>\"Look at my eyes,\" said Sossc\u00fan Ni\u00f1o, one of a small crowd reading the headlines at a newspaper kiosk in central Caracas. \"I've been up all night waiting for the result. Now I'm going home.\" </p> <p>Mr Ni\u00f1o had been at the Miraflores Palace, Mr Ch\u00e1vez's official residence, to hear the 50-year-old president claim victory in the referendum on whether he should be recalled - sacked. </p> <p>\"This was spectacular. There's no other word for it - spectacular,\" he said. \"You have to be a little cautious, but this was a sincere expression of the will of the people. It was magnificent.\" </p> <p>Dressed in a bedraggled red T-shirt bearing the no slogan of the Ch\u00e1vez campaign, Jos\u00e9 Tuarez Serpa was hopping with excitement. \"This shows those bastards,\" he said. \"This was a day for the country, for peace.\" Mr Ch\u00e1vez's victory speech, he said, was \"fantastic ... beautiful\". </p> <p>In the pre-dawn darkness, Mr Ch\u00e1vez, wiping tears from his face, promised a cheering mass of supporters gathered in light rain: \"Starting today Venezuela enters a new phase. Venezuela has changed for ever. There is no going back. </p> <p>\"I have been subjected to the evaluation of the people and, as I have passed the exam, I intend to dedicate myself to my work with even greater determination. This has given me an unprecedented strength to carry on fighting for the country for the rest of my life,\" Mr Ch\u00e1vez said. </p> <p>He sent a message to the US government, which he has accused of interfering in Venezuela's internal affairs. </p> <p>\"The ball has landed in the centre of the White House,\" he said in a reference to a metaphor he had used in the campaign, when he said the result would be like a baseball being hit all the way to Washington. \"Let's hope that this victory permits the government of the US to respect the government and people of Venezuela.\" </p> <p>In the few hours between the closing of the polling stations at midnight on Sunday and the announcement of the referendum result, Ch\u00e1vez supporters began to circulate through Caracas. Trucks laden with Ch\u00e1vistas descended from working class suburbs, preparing for the lengthy celebrations to come. </p> <p>Army reserves, called up to reinforce security at polling stations, sped across the city in lorries, and several armoured cars travelled down the city's main thoroughfare. Not far away, a group of 20 police motorcyclists cruised along, the riders with shotguns strapped to their backs. </p> <p>Last night as rival supporters took to the streets, some violent incidents erupted. In the most serious, shots were fired at a group of opposition supporters. Several people were wounded and taken to hospital. </p> <p>After an extended day of voting, with most polling stations opening at 6am on Sunday and not closing until midnight, the national electoral council released its preliminary count at 4am yesterday. With 94.4% of the votes counted, 4.9m (58.25%) had been cast in favour of not recalling Mr Ch\u00e1vez, it said, while the opposition campaign garnered 3.5m votes (41.74%). </p> <p>The tally came as something of a surprise. During the vote, people linked to the government had been more circumspect, suggesting a winning margin in single figures, while opposition sources had claimed to be leading by at least 10%. </p> <p>The turnout figures were also surprising. Despite the lengthy queues and the extended voting period, the total turnout was just over 8.5 million out of 14 million registered voters. This fell far short of the 80% figure that had been suggested during the referendum, although it was the largest vote the country has known, beating the previous record of 7.5m ballots cast in the 1988 presidential election. </p> <p>While President Ch\u00e1vez celebrated, opposition leaders alleged electoral fraud. </p> <p>The two opposition members of the five-member electoral council distanced themselves from the official result, saying that they had not been given access to the count and that the paper ballots had still not been counted. With a few exceptions, the referendum was an electronic vote, which meant there was no paper count in the traditional manner. </p> <p>Horacio Medina, a former president of the Unapetrol oil company and a member of the opposition umbrella group Democratic Coordinator, said: \"We are the victims of a mega-fraud. The yes vote won the referendum with 60% of the vote.\" </p> <p>Some anomalies over the vote, including the low number of votes cast for the opposition may reflect more on the validity of past votes than on the referendum, said Gregory Wilpert, an associate editor of Venezuelanalysis.com, a Caracas-based website. \"The vote of 3.5m for the opposition suggests they never reached the 3.8m signatures they claimed when calling for the referendum, and that the electoral council was perhaps right at the time to suggest that many of those signatures were fraudulent,\" he said. </p> <p>The dispute over the validity of the vote, coupled with the distrust felt by many Venezuelans for official institutions, placed an enormous emphasis on the findings of the international observers, led by the Carter Centre and the Organisation of American States. </p> <p>Former US president Jimmy Carter urged \"all Venezuelans to accept the results and work together for the future\". \"Our findings coincided with the partial returns announced today by the national elections council,\" he said. </p> <p>C\u00e9sar Gaviria for the OAS said observers had \"not found any element of fraud in the process\". He said the OAS was willing to listen to opposition concerns, \"but not to put the results in doubt\". </p> <p>Despite the tension in official quarters and the unrest last night provoked by opposition protests, most of Caracas went about its business as normal yesterday. </p> <p>\"It's good that we won, but I don't like this triumphalism,\" said one roadside stallholder who preferred not to give his name. \"Now we should settle down and get back to life as normal. It's time for us all to get back to work.\" </p> <p>Outside a deserted polling station in the centre of the city two weary soldiers were standing at 8am. \"No, we're not guarding anything,\" they said. \"We're just waiting for someone to come and take us home.\"</p>"
