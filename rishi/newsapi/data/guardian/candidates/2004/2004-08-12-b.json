  "Hugo Ch\u00e1vez's peculiar one-man revolution will be put to the test on Sunday. After nearly six years in power, the Venezuelan president is fighting to avoid the thumbs-down in a referendum with implications reaching far beyond Caracas. <p>The vote on whether to recall - sack - Mr Ch\u00e1vez is partly a verdict on his controversial war on poverty. His activist's approach to securing social justice and independence for a country and a continent overshadowed by the north has been the source of many disputes. </p> <p>But the referendum is also about one man's often wilful exercise of power. </p> <p>Opinion polls suggest that the vote is too close to call. And after two years of confrontation between Mr Ch\u00e1vez's supporters and opponents, many fear that a period of national instability, and even intervention by the armed forces, could ensue if the result is disputed. That in turn would deal a blow to the wider cause of Latin American democracy. </p> <p>As voting day approaches, tensions are evident. Concerns were expressed this week about the fairness of the referendum, which will be monitored by the Organisation of American States and the Carter Centre. </p> <p>The vice-president, Jos\u00e9 Vicente Rangel, felt obliged to issue a public assurance on Monday that Venezuela's oil exports would not be disrupted, whatever the outcome. More than 100,000 troops are being deployed to provide additional security. </p> <p>After previously trying to seize power by force, Mr Ch\u00e1vez was elected in 1998 with a commitment to reform what he saw as a corrupt party political system. He rewrote the constitution and launched a series of social programmes known as missions. These initiatives included literacy programmes, scholarships, state-run supermarkets and healthcare, financed by levies on the state-owned oil company, PdVSA. </p> <p>But while popular among the poor, Mr Ch\u00e1vez's reforms were opposed by the better-off sectors of the population. </p> <p>In April 2002 he narrowly survived a coup which the US state department now describes as \"a temporary alteration of constitutional order\", but which was widely believed to have been approved by the Bush administration. </p> <p>That December also saw the eruption of a lengthy general strike that led to the present referendum process. During that conflict, Mr Ch\u00e1vez sacked 18,000 PdVSA employees who had disrupted oil production by walking off the job. </p> <p>His opponents describe him as a reckless and dictatorial ideologue intent on foisting communist ideas on the country. He sees himself as a champion of the masses in a long and honourable Latin American tradition, a populist who hosts his own television show, called Hello, President, and an inveterate foe of what he calls US \"imperialism\". </p> <p>Venezuela has paid a heavy price for the Ch\u00e1vez phenomenon. The general strike cost an estimated $7.5bn (\u00a34.1bn). Although the economy is expanding again, that follows a contraction of 8.9% in 2002, compared with the previous year, and a further contraction of 9.2% in 2003. </p> <p>During this period, Venezuela's dependence on its petroleum industry has become more marked, unhealthily so, say some analysts. </p> <p>According to the US department of energy, oil accounts for more than three-quarters of Venezuela's exports. </p> <p>As a result of the general strike and the sacking of oil workers, however, Venezuela's oil production levels are said to be uncertain. This under-performance is blamed by some on Mr Ch\u00e1vez's political interventions. </p> <p>Mr Ch\u00e1vez clashed with Washington over his alliance with Fidel Castro's Cuba, to which he supplies discounted oil, and the war in Iraq. Washington's plans for a Latin American free trade area and his alleged support for regional insurgencies are other causes of friction. </p> <p>The Bush administration, for its part, has quietly portrayed Venezuela's leader as irresponsible. Yet Mr Ch\u00e1vez surely knows that Washington is playing a weaker hand these days. </p> <p>With world oil prices at record levels, the one thing President George Bush cannot afford before the November US election is another sudden oil price spike. But that is what will happen following a disputed referendum outcome or a defeat. </p> <p>For that reason, paradoxically, the White House could be hoping for a victory for the incumbent on Sunday. Learning to live with Hugo Ch\u00e1vez's peculiarities may turn out to be the political price of plentiful oil.</p>",
  "For a loyal company man, Porter Goss appeared to be going out of his way to offend his former and potentially future employers at the CIA, saying that the agency was so badly managed it risked becoming \"a stilted bureaucracy incapable of even the slightest bit of success\". <p>Intelligence insiders say the attack on the directorate of operations where Mr Goss once worked was the result of careful calculation, and was intended to demonstrate the commitment of the Republican congressman to reforming the agency. </p> <p>It was delivered seven weeks ago - when there was already intense speculation that Mr Goss would be nominated to head the CIA - in a report from the house intelligence committee, which he headed until Tuesday. In the broadside, Mr Goss accused the CIA of ignoring its core mission activities, adding that the agency was so badly run it was heading \"over a proverbial cliff\". </p> <p>If his appointment as CIA director is confirmed by the Senate, Mr Goss will inherit that monument to mismanagement. What is less clear, however, is not only how far he will go in restructuring the CIA, but how long his job will exist. </p> <p>Intelligence reform proposals popular among Democrats include the appointment of a national intelligence tsar, who would outrank the CIA chief and control the budgets of 15 information-gathering services. That proposal is likely to become a key element of Mr Goss's confirmation hearings, which are expected to begin in early September. While the Democrats do not want to be seen as obstructing a key appointment in the war on terror, the proceedings are likely to become a platform from which to attack the Bush administration on intelligence. </p> <p>While Mr Goss certainly has the pedigree to be CIA chief, he presents a potentially rich target. Now 65, he is the product of a patrician Connecticut upbringing, graduating from an elite preparatory school and Yale University. He spent two years in the army in military intelligence before joining the CIA in 1962. It was the height of the cold war, and Mr Goss, who speaks Spanish, worked as a clandestine case officer based in the Miami office. </p> <p>At a time when the CIA was obsessive about the idea of communist infiltration of the trade unions - and undertook to sabotage or destroy so-called front organisations - his beat was the labour movements of central America and, later, Europe. Mr Goss has spoken little about his 10 years in the agency, beyond an aside that he was in the region during the Cuban missile crisis in 1962. \"I had some very interesting moments in the Florida Straits,\" he told reporters recently. </p> <p>In the early 1970s, he contracted a bacteriological infection that almost killed him. The CIA ordered him into a desk job. It was not what he wanted, and Mr Goss left the agency. </p> <p>While he was in hospital, doctors had advised him to recuperate in a warm climate, and he chose Sanibel island, in south-west Florida, in part because a fellow CIA case officer had retired there. Mr Goss moved to the island in 1971, installing his wife, four children, a great dane, a cat and two turtles in a small rented three-bedroom house. \"He was kind of puny looking,\" said Grace Whitehead, the widow of Mr Goss's CIA colleague. \"He blossomed here.\" </p> <p>The Florida ventures started small: a boat letting agency with funds kept in two shoeboxes on the kitchen table of the Whitehead home. They did not stay small. The late Mr Whitehead founded a newspaper, largely as a vehicle from which to campaign for Sanibel to be incorporated as a municipality, and Mr Goss was chief reporter. When Sanibel - with its population of 1,200 - was incorporated, Mr Goss became mayor. </p> <p>He used the office to protect Sanibel from the developers who have reduced much of the Florida coast to hideous concrete high-rises. About two-thirds of the island has been designated as a conservation zone; the rest is an enclave of extremely expensive homes. </p> <p>He was gradually drawn into state politics and ran for Congress in 1988. His area is so heavily Republican that Mr Goss was re-elected unopposed in four subsequent elections. </p> <p>Although he is on the right on several of America's defining issues - he opposes abortion except in the case of rape, opposes gay marriage and supports the death penalty - in his early years in Congress he had a good reputation with local environmentalists in Florida. He sought a ban on oil drilling off the Florida coast, and supported speedboat bans to protect manatee. However, Laura Combs, from Save the Manatee, said he later did a U-turn on wildlife protection. </p> <p>He became chairman of the House of Representatives intelligence committee in 1997. That, and his years in the CIA, are his main credentials for the job. </p> <p>\"Frankly, I can't think of anybody who is that close to the agency without being in it at this time,\" said Peter Earnest, a 36-year veteran of the CIA, who is now director of Washington's Spy museum. </p> <p>But critics say Mr Goss can claim relatively few accomplishments for a lifetime devoted to intelligence issues. </p> <p>\"He has been head of the intelligence oversight committee for eight years. Can you point to one substantive thing that he has done in his position as chair?\" said a former counter-terrorism official. \"Instead of being a visionary, an activist, someone who would take the lead in getting the agency to reform, instead of addressing repeated intelligence failures that have occurred, Porter Goss was missing in action. He was just playing the status quo.\" </p> <p>During the years when Mr Goss's committee was entrusted with oversight of America's intelligence community, the CIA failed to predict in 1998 that India would conduct a nuclear test, or that al-Qaida would bomb US embassies in east Africa, US warplanes mistakenly bombed the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, and a small al-Qaida motorboat blew a hole in the US navy destroyer USS Cole. Then came the attack by hijacked aircraft on the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon in September 2001. </p> <p>The final report of the commission investigating the September 11 terrorist attacks also challenged Mr Goss's record, saying that he had given little attention to al-Qaida or terrorism before the attacks. Between January 1998 and the attacks, Mr Goss's committee held just two hearings on terrorism. The Senate committee on intelligence held eight hearings; the armed services committee held nine. </p> <p>But until relatively recently Mr Goss had the respect of his Democratic colleagues for a pragmatic, bipartisan style. That balance was gradually eroded over the last year, congressional staff say, as he cemented an alliance with the vice-president, Dick Cheney, and became more forthright about his Republican loyalties. Democrats accuse him of being too concerned with sparing the administration embarrassment. </p> <p>He blocked house investigations into the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse scandal and Washington's links with its erstwhile Iraqi ally Ahmad Chalabi. </p> <p>The final straw for Democrats arrived the same week as Mr Goss delivered his diatribe against the CIA. During a debate in the house on security, he held up a sign with a 27-year-old quote from the Democratic challenger, John Kerry, calling for budget cuts to the intelligence services. Mr Goss later expressed regret, but by this week, when his nomination was announced, Democrats said he was too partisan to be CIA director. </p> <p>Mr Goss could fall down on another point: his willingness to make reform. He is not a subscriber to the view of the 9/11 commission that the White House should appoint a national intelligence chief who would assert overall financial and managerial control of America's 15 intelligence services. </p> <p>Instead, he has fixed his sights firmly on the CIA. He introduced legislation last June that would give the agency director control over the $40bn (\u00a322bn) combined budgets of the 15 intelligence services. \"Right now we have got this anomaly where we give the authority to one person and the money to someone else,\" Mr Goss told the Tampa Tribune last June. \"That's the problem.\" </p> <p>That stand - which is in line with the administration - could prove a major liability for Mr Goss if the Democrats turn the confirmation hearings into a test of absolute fealty to the reforms urged by the September 11 commission. </p> <p>But wellwishers say that does not mean that Mr Goss is averse to restructuring the CIA. Frank MacGaffin, a former deputy director, believes the insider knowledge that remains Mr Goss's strongest suit will drive him to change the way the agency operates. \"He knows where things went wrong, and he must also have the same guilty knowledge that I and others have of the imperative of fixing it before there is another attack,\" Mr MacGaffin said. \"That guilty knowledge tells you that if you don't change some very essential things, it is going to happen again.\"</p> <p><b>Life in short</b></p> <p><b>Born</b><br>Waterbury, New Haven County, Connecticut, November 26 1938 </p> <p><b>Education</b><br>BA Yale University, 1960 </p> <p><b>Family</b><br>Wife, Mariel Robinson; four children; 11 grandchildren </p> <p><b>Wealth</b><br>Reported assets worth between $6m (\u00a33.3m) and $24m last year </p> <p><b>Career</b><br>US army 1960-62; CIA, 1962-72; member of city council and mayor, Sanibel, Florida, 1974-82; chair, Lee County, Florida, Commission 1985-86; Republican congressman, US House of Representatives, 1988 to present </p> <p><b>Bush on Goss</b><br>'Over 15 years of service, Porter Goss has built a reputation as a reformer.

  "<p>Nellie McKay isn't a morning person. It's lunchtime, but she was up early to tape a TV appearance. In the lobby of a San Francisco hotel, she uncurls herself from the sofa onto which she's flopped and, brushing hair from her eyes, offers a sleepy, drawled \"Hi\", as if she were a 14-year-old at a slumber party. </p> <p>In fact, she's the 19-year-old author of a wilfully eccentric, impossible to categorise debut album. Hailed as a prodigy in the US, critics have frothed over her ability to switch from elegant jazz to rap to complex satirical songs worthy of Sondheim. She disappears upstairs to change for the photographer; when she returns - in a shimmering cocktail dress and heels - it's as if she's thrown on the sophistication of someone 10 years older. Her skin glows under the lamplight. </p> <p>\"She's a proper artist,\" says Geoff Emerick, best known for his work as an engineer with the Beatles, who produced the album. \"Judy Garland. Whatever. You don't know what is going on in her mind. That's what makes her an artist.\" </p> <p>McKay seems to agree. \"Mystery is good,\" she says. Then, disarmingly: \"People don't see your flaws. That's why I don't like to let people get so close to me, 'cos then they'll see I'm [she mimes helplessness] just like them.\" Given her eccentric upbringing, and precocious talent, that seems unlikely. </p> <p>Her father is a film director; her mother, was an actress; her mother's father was Spanish, and a convicted murderer. McKay likes to entertain the possibility that he may have been Hispanic American because \"then you might get some native American, too\". Born in London, McKay and her mother had left for California by the time she was two, leaving her father in England, and settling in Harlem, New York, a year later. </p> <p>Was she was conscious of being a white kid in a black neighbourhood? \"No. I really think most kids feel kind of special. You just don't notice stuff. I didn't notice how poor we were at all. And you don't get scared, well sometimes you do, but you think your mother will defend you. You think your mother is capable of anything. The past few years it's started getting gentrified. Back then,\" McKay deadpans, \"it was the tail end of the crack boom.\" She's sanguine about her parent's break up: \"I'm glad it happened when I was so young.\" </p> <p>At six she started to play the recorder, at seven the piano, at eight saxophone. As she and her mother and numerous cats moved from apartment to apartment, from East Coast to West and back, cello and mallet percussion followed. Contemporary pop music didn't really turn McKay's head. \"I remember not responding to tapes my friends had: Madonna, Mariah Carey. There was a teacher at our school who was Mariah Carey's cousin, which was meant to be a big deal. I listened to what my mother played at home: Dylan, Lennon, Chopin, Yoko Ono, the Beatles. The first tape I remember owning was the sound of a humpback whale which we bought at the airport.\" Not for nothing did Time Out New York describe her as \"stylistically like a living, breathing White Album\". </p> <p>Though clearly bright, McKay did not get on at school. \"Well,\" she ponders \"I'm not intelligent enough to do certain things to get certain places, but I'm glad, 'cos I got here, which is pretty sweet. I've made no safety net for myself, which is either genius or pretty stupid. But school was a pretty unvarying structure. I used to read for fun: school took all the fun out of it.\" </p> <p>Her time at the Manhattan School of Music was similarly unfruitful, and she quit. \"Hated it,\" she laughs, and pulls a face. \"The social scene ... I imagined New York City to be like all those 1960s movies, where every window has a skyline outside, there is an ethical code, and a dress code. It's Cary Grant, it's all those Rosalind Russell movies where she wore suits. So I wore suits, and it's just not like that at all. College is icky. I thought, forget it, man. I'll just play the gay bars and live in their fantasy world.\" </p> <p>Most astonishingly, she only began to write two years ago. \"Watching Miss America,\" she says, \"there's the girl who plays cymbals and the girl who sings. Who gets more attention?\" But the Beatles were the real catalyst: \"I saw A Hard Day's Night at the cinema. Just seeing the Beatles, and getting that big smile on your face.\" Her LP Get Away With Me displays remarkable maturity and versatility. Manhattan Avenue is so evocatively elegant it could almost be an old jazz standard. It's A Pose is a satirical expose of the New Man. In several songs, it's obvious she is no fan of George Bush. While discussing John Kerry's speech to the Democratic convention, she says: \"If I was to have a lesbian crush, it would be on Theresa Heinz Kerry.\" </p> <p>\"I was knocked out by the lyrics,\" confirms Emerick. \"And I've worked with Elvis Costello. There is so much garbage around.\" </p> <p>\"As much as she'd listen to me,\" says Mitchell Cohen, who was behind the signing of McKay to Colombia, \"I encourage her to be as extreme as possible.\" </p> <p>Managed by her mother, Robin Pappas, McKay has, she says, an excellent relationship with her label. Clearly though, she's a handful. \"Unlike a lot of managers out there [my mother], doesn't give a shit what the label thinks. I mean, we're very political. I can't help thinking we must be more pleasant to work with than a lot of management teams. It's girlie. It's fun. We fight so often it is unbelievable. But there is no one I trust in the world like her.\" </p> <p>Pappas is such an entertaining character in her own right, a child of lesser personality might have felt overwhelmed. She's already made one fantastically lurid confession before realising there is a journalist present. It's clear, however, she isn't the archetypal pushy stage mother; they both know who's boss. </p> <p>Precisely by digging in her heels, and despite being told by Bob Dylan's manager that she \"was fighting the wrong battles\", McKay persuaded Colombia to release a double album, unheard of for a debut artist. </p> <p>\"I was not the biggest advocate of that idea,\" Cohen remembers. \"But she convinced the label that this was how it had to be. It's indicative of her ambition. I think she expects to work on a really big screen.\" She does: her next project is a film musical of Katherine Arnoldi's book The Amazing True Story of a Teenage Single Mom. </p> <p>First, though, as Pappas says, she has to pay her dues, which means a less than glamorous cross country trek playing 20 minute sets as opener for Barenaked Ladies and Alanis Morrissette. That night, they have a six-hour drive to LA, just the two of them in a rented Cadillac. But there is something romantic about it all, as if maybe life could be like a Hollywood musical after all. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Get Away From Me is out on Columbia Records/Sony Music on September 13.</p>",
  "The California supreme court yesterday declared the marriages of thousands of same-sex couples in San Francisco void, after ruling that the city's mayor exceeded his authority by granting them marriage licences. <p>The ruling was the latest setback to efforts by the gay community to challenge laws that restrict the institution of marriage to heterosexual couples. </p> <p>The court said the mayor, Gavin Newsom, and city officials violated the law when they issued the certificates, since legislation and a state voter-approved measure defined marriage as a union between a man and woman. </p> <p>The judges decided by a 5-2 vote to nullify the 3,995 gay marriages performed in the city between February 12 and March 11, when the court halted the weddings. Their legality, Justice Joyce Kennard wrote, must wait until courts resolve the constitutionality of state laws that restrict marriages to opposite-sex couples. </p> <p>The court ordered officials in San Francisco to \"undo\" their previous \"unauthorised\" actions, correct official records and notify the newlyweds that their marriages were void. </p> <p>The ruling disappointed gay rights advocates who had hoped the weddings would remain valid while the broader arguments of the constitutionality of excluding same-sex couples from the institution of marriage were thrashed out. Gay couples faced the reversal with a mixture of defiance and dismay. </p> <p>\"No court can take away the love we share,\" said John Lewis, who married his partner, Stuart Gaffney, in the city six months ago. </p> <p>Phyllis Lyon, 79, who mar ried Del Martin, 83, said: \"After being together for more than 50 years, it is a terrible blow to have the rights and protections of marriage taken from us. At our age, we do not have the luxury of time.\" </p> <p>The issue of gay marriage has become a thorny one in the US after two key legal rulings last year. The first, by the US supreme court, struck down sodomy laws, effectively removing the last legal obstacle to gay relationships. </p> <p>The second, in Massachusetts, made gay marriage legal in that state alone, prompting President George Bush and other Republicans to call for an amendment to the US constitution that would limit mar riage to heterosexuals. Many states have already amended their statutes to do that. </p> <p>While neither of the Democratic party's White House challengers, John Kerry and John Edwards, supports gay marriage, both are opposed to a constitutional amendment. The right of same-sex couples to have their relationships legally recognised is expected to become a central social issue of the presidential campaign. </p> <p>The ruling \"is important, but it will not resolve whether same-sex couples have the right to marry and be treated equally under our state constitution\", Jennifer Pizer, a lawyer with the Lambda Legal Defence and Education Fund, a gay rights legal aid group, told the Associated Press. </p> <p>The issue of whether the mayor exceeded his authority had already been conceded by most gay activists. Kate Kendell, the director of the National Centre for Lesbian Rights, said it was clear Mr Newsom would be overruled. </p> <p>\"We think that's unfortunate and wrong, but the more human question is what to do with marriage licences that belong to couples in relationships and with families.\"</p>",
  "<b>New York Times</b> <br> Editorial, August 11 <p>\"As the September 11 commission made clear, the nation urgently needs to reorganise its intelligence agencies. Nominating a new candidate for the old, unreformed job of director of central intelligence, as President George Bush did [on Tuesday], is not the logical or appropriate place to start ... </p> <p>\"Mr Bush seems to be deliberately inviting a confirmation battle by turning to Representative Porter Goss of Florida, a partisan Republican and a man criticised for his close, protective relationship with that intelligence agency - where he once worked ...

But neither is he blameless, and the decision to nominate him consequently risks picking a fight. </p> <p>\"Any such fight would be exceptionally unfortunate, as it would further politicise the ongoing debate ... over intelligence reform ...

  "<p>Pentagon auditors have concluded that Halliburton, the chief contractor in Iraq, has failed to properly account for $1.8bn (\u00a31bn) in charges billed to the US government. </p> <p>The findings, laid out in a 60-page report, threaten to put fresh political pressure on Halliburton's former chief, vice president Dick Cheney. The company has stumbled from one scandal to another, providing ammunition for Democrats in the run-up to November's presidential elections. </p> <p>The amount in question represents 43% of the total $4.18bn that Halliburton subsidiary Kellogg Brown &amp; Root has charged the US government for providing logistical support to troops - everything from meals to towels. </p> <p>KBR has a separate contract helping to restore oil fields in Iraq. It has billed the government for $6.3bn so far. </p> <p>The Pentagon has previously threatened to withhold payment on some charges owing to disputes with Halliburton on its methods of accounting. Officials have accused KBR of inflating prices for oil it imported from neighbouring countries immediately after the war. </p> <p>The Pentagon pays Halliburton for work under way and the company is required to provide detailed billing to justify the payments. </p> <p>The Wall Street Journal, which had sight of the report, said the audit found KBR's \"internal control policies\" were \"inadequate for providing verifiable, supportable, documented cost estimates that are acceptable for negotiating a fair and reasonable price\". </p> <p>Halliburton said it disagreed with the findings and would issue a response within the time set out by the government. It argued that the authors of the report were acting in an advisory capacity only and that normally such reports \"are part of a lengthy but routine process that is amicably resolved\". It added that \"only in an election year when Halliburton is being covered in a political context as opposed to business\" does this kind of dispute become news. </p> <p>\"As we have stated previously, we believe these issues will be resolved in our favour,\" the company said. \"Even if they are not, we don't believe it will affect the company's liquidity because Halliburton will, in turn, withhold payments to subcontractors\". </p> <p>Democrats accuse the Bush administration of cronyism in awarding the company so much business.

  "<p>The latest increase in US interest rates - from 1.25% to 1.5% - is as interesting politically as it is economically. President Bush senior blamed Alan Greenspan (chairman of the Federal Reserve then and now) for not doing more to boost economic growth in the run-up to the 1992 election he lost to Bill Clinton. Republicans today fear they may be watching a video replay as the same Mr Greenspan applies the brakes to a recovery that has appeared invisible to many Americans because of its inability to generate new jobs. Last month the much-monitored figures for non-farm payrolls showed an increase of only 32,000 jobs when Wall Street had been expecting over seven times that. There are over a million fewer jobs in the economy since George Bush's victory in 2000. On present showing he will go down in history as only the second president to preside over a net loss of jobs in his term of office. </p> <p>It is not that the rate of growth itself is bad. Indeed most pundits believe that after a brief mid-year slowdown the economy will be expanding at over 3% by the time of the election in November. What does matter is the quality of that growth and the absence of a \"feelgood factor\" associated with it. Mr Bush promised millions of new jobs as a direct result of his controversial tax cuts aimed dispropor tionately at the rich. This fiscal irresponsibility was combined with steep rises in public spending (particularly on the military) and a highly permissive monetary policy pursued by the Federal Reserve that has kept interest rates at artificially low levels in order to stimulate the recovery. </p> <p>It worked in the sense that this cocktail of measures pulled the economy out of the 2001 recession - but at the cost of building up a huge budget deficit and trade deficit that will take many years to rectify. It was a reckless fiscal and monetary expansion that would have made Lord Keynes turn in his grave. So far, the result is a pitiful number of new jobs, prompting voters to ask what economic policy is for, if it does not generate new jobs. </p> <p>The US has so far managed to ride out its huge fiscal deficit without disastrous consequences, mainly because the rest of the world - and Asia in particular - has been prepared to lend it the money. So far, the most apocalyptic predictions of collapse have not come true. And barring an external shock, like much higher oil prices or a sudden exodus of money, there is no particular reason to think there will be an implosion this side of the election. But clearing up the mess afterwards will be quite another matter.</p>",
  "The South Korean government confirmed yesterday that it is to create a new capital in what will be one of Asia's biggest ever construction projects. <p>Under the \u00a326bn scheme, a site in the sleepy region of Gongju-Yongi 100 miles south of Seoul will replace it as the seat of parliament and government by 2020. Despite sharp divisions among the public and the mixed results of similarly ambitious projects by other states, president Roh Moo-hyun insists relocation is necessary to ease chronic overcrowding in Seoul, redistribute the state's wealth, and lessen the danger of a bombardment by North Korea. </p> <p>Gongju-Yongi is a hilly, rural area in Korea's midlands. Its selection was finalised yesterday - although an appeal has been made to the constitutional court - and caused joy among local farmers expecting a property boom. </p> <p>Under the plan, announced by the prime minister, Lee Hae-chan, the government will start buying 7,100 hectares (17,540 acres) next year. After construction starts in 2007, the administration hopes to begin moving 230,000 employees into 85 ministries and institutions within five years. With the addition of the constitutional court, a national assembly and the presidential palace, it is expected that this region of 140,000 people will become home to half a million. To fund the move, the government will sell off most of the state's property in Seoul, including the presidential Blue House. </p> <p>The idea is to create a centre of government similar to Washington DC, while leaving Seoul as a business, financial and cultural capital equivalent to New York. Previous development plans for what is Asia's third biggest economy have concentrated so much money and power in Seoul that the city and its environs are home to almost half of South Korea's 48 million population. By comparison, one in nine Britons lives in London. </p> <p>President Roh made relocation a pillar of his election campaign, and says it is vital to improve conditions in Seoul by reducing its population by a tenth. A move 100 miles south also takes the government out of the range of much of North Korea's weaponry. </p> <p>Opponents in the Grand National party argue that the scheme is vote-buying and will cost two or three times times the estimate. Many newspapers have called for further investigation, and civic groups have challenged the plan's validity; the constitutional court must rule within six months if it is to go ahead. </p> <p>Surveys indicate that the public is evenly split. Most feel the question should be put to a referendum, something the president has refused to accept. The fiercest criticism has been in Seoul, where the mayor, Lee Myung-bak, has warned that relocation would undermine the competitiveness of South Korea as a business hub. </p> <p>In a battle of wills, the city authorities pulled down subway advertisements by the central government which claimed that Seoul had the worst standard of living among the world's 20 biggest cities. Another discarded poster featured a cartoon of a cramped Seoul businessman watching enviously as a Chinese rival pedals across the expanse of Beijing's Tiananmen Square on his bicycle. The caption read: \"Ten reasons why foreign companies choose Beijing rather than Seoul.\" </p> <p>It is far from certain, however, that foreign businesses or countries favour relocation. Newspapers report several negative comments by diplomats concerned at the cost of moving. The United States embassy, now in the process of moving within Seoul, said it had no plan to shift again in the foreseeable future. </p> <p>Such hesitation is inevitable, given the history of Korea's itinerant capital. Yongi country was a centre of government once before - during the Paekyae dynasty 1,500 years ago. Its second opportunity may not last long. If the peninsula re-unifies, there are likely to be calls for the capital to be moved north again, possibly even back to Pyongyang - another ancient seat of government.</p> <p><b>City swaps</b></p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b> In 1956 <b> Brazil's </b> capital moved from lively, crowded Rio to remote Brasilia.

  "Despite arriving sooner than expected and catching much of the American press off guard, the June 28 handover of sovereignty in Iraq was trumpeted as a momentous event. <p>That night CNN devoted its entire prime-time lineup to analysing the brief, 15-minute ceremony in Baghdad. Fox News cheered it as \"a day that will go down in history\". Newspapers the next morning were clogged with reports from Iraq and speculation about what the transfer of political power would mean for the rebuilding of Iraq, as well as for the 140,000 US troops serving there. </p> <p>The handover, though, has done very little to change things for the better in Iraq. In the past six weeks, the country has been gripped in escalating violence, forcing some coalition countries and private contractors to flee for safety. Kidnappings by insurgents have multiplied, as have assassinations, while electricity still remains in short supply. </p> <p>Iraq's national conference - critical to the eventual implementation of free elections - has been postponed, and US soldiers continue to die. </p> <p>\"On June 28, my feeling was nothing was going to change because of the handover,\" says Steven Cook, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. \"There were still going to be car bombings and US soldiers being killed, and that's exactly what's happened. Nothing has changed.\" </p> <p>But one thing did change: US press coverage of Iraq. The handover marked a turning point in the level and intensity of media interest, which sharply decreased, particularly on the 24-hour cable news channels. </p> <p>\"Clearly the volume in press coverage has gone way down,\" says Cook. \"'Sleepy' is a good word to describe it. The coverage doesn't compare with anything we'd seen during the previous 12 months from Iraq. The drop-off has been noticeable.\" </p> <p>\"From the very beginning this has been an administration that wanted to hide the toll of the war -- and the media have been absolutely complicit in that,\" says Nancy Lessin, co-founder of the antiwar group Military Families Speak Out. Lessin's stepson, a Marine, served in Iraq during the spring of 2003. \"In April of this year, violence in Iraq was up and it was hard to keep the war off the front pages. But as soon as possible the pictures changed. Since June 28, [the war has] been off the front pages again.\" </p> <p>More recently, a week's worth of fierce fighting in Najaf between coalition forces and militant Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr's Mahdi army has begun to bring Iraq back into focus. And if US forces unleash a frontal assault there, Iraq will once again dominate the headlines, as it so often has in the past 18 months. </p> <p>\"We're still interested in the story. We're on the air every night about Iraq,\" says Marcy McGinnis, senior vice-president of news at CBS. \"But what's happened is, interest in the political scene has increased. News always ebbs and flows, and at times it may appear Iraq is taking a back seat to politics because that's what's in the news right now.\" </p> <p>Following the ebb-and-flow theory, Iraq is likely to return to the media forefront, however temporarily, when the 1,000th US soldier dies in Iraq. Based on the current fatality rate, that sombre event could happen as soon as late September. Still, considered as a whole from July 1 to the present, coverage of Iraq seems to have diminished. \"It's incredible how the press has veered away from Iraq\" since June 28, says Peter Singer, a national security fellow at the Brookings Institution. </p> <p>Last week \"six US soldiers were killed in 24 hours, and there was nothing. If you're President Bush and you see headlines about Martha Stewart and Laci Peterson, you've got to count yourself lucky, because that means the focus is no longer on Iraq.\" </p> <p>The physical danger reporters face inside Iraq has clearly curbed their efforts to report more. And for editors and producers back in America, trying to find a way to make the repetitive nature of the events in Iraq compelling remains a challenge. \"One can imagine editors saying, 'Gee, we just did a roadside bombing story yesterday,'\" says Singer. \"But that's how an insurgency works; it's the same attack over and over.\" </p> <p>That fatigue among members of the press corps makes it less likely that the daily violence in Iraq will be considered newsworthy. \"I covered the bombing of the UN headquarters in Baghdad in August of 2003, and that was a shock,\" says Ken Dilanian, a staff writer for the Philadelphia Inquirer who has spent several months reporting from Iraq in the past year. </p> <p>\"As I recall, CNN broke into its regular programming live and stayed with it all day. That was with 24 people dead. Nowadays that happens every week, and it's on Page A14.\" Press fatigue \"was bound to set in,\" agrees Cook. \"But it is uncanny how it occurred right after the change in sovereignty on June 28.\" </p> <p>The media's shift away from Iraq is good news for the White House, which has watched American sentiment turn decisively against the war and specifically against President Bush's handling of the ongoing military effort. </p> <p>\"Without question, the Bush administration is better off with no news from Iraq,\" says Larry Diamond, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution who served in Baghdad as an advisor to the Coalition Provisional Authority last spring. Now the administration is much more interested in ushering the war on terror back into the foreground, while shuffling Iraq into the background. </p> <p>\"Terrorism news trumps Iraq news for Bush,\" says Juan Cole, a professor of modern Middle Eastern history at the University of Michigan. The emphasis on terrorism news fits with Bush's poll results. Fifty-two percent of Americans approve of how Bush is handling the war on terror, compared with just 37 approving of his actions in Iraq, according to the latest CBS poll. </p> <p>So far, the White House's choreography is working as planned, particularly on cable TV, which is feasting on fresh terror warnings at home while giving just token attention to Iraq. So are newspapers like the New York Post. On August 7, under the banner headline \"War on Terror,\" the Post spread 11 stories over five pages detailing the \"Crackdown on Qaeda Creeps\". The Post ran just a single article that day about the situation in Iraq. Readers might be getting the impression that Iraq is as irrelevant as Afghanistan has become. </p> <p>Yet the diminished attention to Iraq has created an odd media disconnect. While most pundits agree Iraq will be a key issue in November, Americans are being exposed to less reporting and analysis about the war. \"There's an inverse relationship in press coverage and the situation in Iraq,\" says Cook. \"It's amazing; the press has grown weary of reporting the same story regardless of how important it is. It is the issue in the campaign.\" </p> <p>For example, in the wake of the sovereignty handover, NBC's \"Meet the Press\" discussed Iraq in depth during its July 4 telecast, featuring Senator Joe Lieberman, and Senator John Warner, who spent nearly 20 minutes on the topic. In the five weeks since that broadcast, however, the show has not once matched that degree of focus on Iraq. </p> <p>Instead, when the topic is addressed it's invariably in a domestic political context: How will Iraq affect the US election? What's actually happening in Iraq has much less salience. (On the Aug. 8 broadcast of \"Meet the Press,\" national security advisor Condoleezza Rice was asked 18 questions; only three were about Iraq, and none were related to current events there.) </p> <p>Ironically, after the Democrats' convention in Boston, \"Meet the Press\" host Tim Russert, suggesting it was the Democrats who were not anxious to raise the war issue, asserted that Iraq was \"the 800-pound elephant in the room that people don't want to talk about\". Yet it is \"Meet the Press\" itself, along with much more of the mainstream press, that has become increasingly fascinated with domestic politics and indifferent to the war. </p> <p>The political ramifications of the media's recent sluggishness are significant because, aside from military families, most Americans don't have a direct connection with the war. How the press plays - or downplays - Iraq between now and November \"will have a profound impact on the election,\" says Phil Trounstine, director of the Survey and Policy Research Institute at San Jose State University. \"Less coverage would be good for the president,\" he observes. </p> <p>A recent survey conducted by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press suggests a direct link between reporting on Iraq (or how people treat the news from Iraq) and Bush's political fortunes. During the month of June, just 39% of Americans paid very close attention to the news coming out of Iraq, the lowest rate for all of 2004. </p> <p>Over the same period, the survey found, Americans' opinion of Bush, as well as of the situation in Iraq, improved noticeably. On July 14, ABC News' the Note - the online roundup of the day's must-reads for political junkies - theorised: \"The Bush campaign is counting on the continued absence of a drumbeat of bad news out of Iraq to improve right track/wrong track\" polling numbers. </p> <p>Was there really an absence of bad news from Iraq? Nearly three dozen GI's were killed during the first two weeks of July. On that same July 14 day, Iraq erupted in a new wave of violence. A suicide attacker detonated a massive car bomb near the British embassy, killing 11 and wounding 40. </p> <p>An insurgent group, probably led by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, announced it had beheaded a Bulgarian hostage. Five Iraqis were killed and 21 insurgents were wounded in fierce fighting in the Iraqi city of Ramadi. </p> <p>Insurgents killed the governor of Mosul as he was driving in a convoy of vehicles. A gunman assassinated the director general of Iraq's Industry Ministry as he left his Baghdad home. Meanwhile, two GI's were killed that day when their vehicle rolled over. </p> <p>Few if any of those deadly incidents on July 14 received sustained cable news coverage in America; instead the congressional vote on same-sex marriage was the preferred topic of the day. </p> <p>The next day, canvassing the media landscape for stories that might affect the November election, the Note made no reference to the carnage in Iraq. Since June 28, that has often been the case with the Note, which perhaps better than any other site accurately captures the shifting moods and priorities of Washington's political press corps. </p> <p>For instance, on July 22, the Note linked to 116 separate stories, drawn from 23 quasi-political categories (9/11 commission, national security, the economy, same-sex marriage, etc.). Not one of them had to do with events in Iraq. </p> <p>And that was just 24 hours after an audacious bombing by insurgents of a Baghdad police station, a deadly attack that was completely overshadowed on cable news outlets by the story that former national security advisor Sandy Berger had been under investigation - for nearly six months - for breaching protocol at the National Archives while reviewing documents in preparation for the 9/11 commission hearings. </p> <p>Television wasn't alone in downplaying the police station bombing story. While the Washington Times and the Washington Post both put the attack on Page 1, scores of major-market dailies, including the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Arizona Republic, Denver Post, Hartford Courant, Indianapolis Star, New York Times and San Jose Mercury News, kept the story off the front page. </p> <p>A recent check of the Note on Aug. 2 indicated more of the same: 83 story links in 15 categories, none of them dealing with Iraq. Yet voters are told by the press that come November, the issue of Iraq may very well decide the election. After June 28, the line about there being \"no bad news\" from Iraq even seeped into reported pieces. On July 21, the New York Times, in a campaign trail dispatch, noted that one key factor that may work in Bush's favour in November is that \"in Iraq, the transfer of sovereignty has led to some reduction in American casualties.\" </p> <p>But, in fact, nearly as many US soldiers lost their lives in Iraq during the first half of July alone as did during the entire month of June. Of the 15 months since major combat ended, July ranks as the fourth deadliest for US soldiers serving in Iraq. And if August's current fatality rate continues, it will easily claim more American lives than July did. </p> <p>So why does the press act as if the handover of sovereignty has changed the situation on the ground? \"It seems the mainstream press has bought in to the White House line about June 28 - 'OK, we're in a new phase,'\" says Lessin of Military Families Speak Out. </p> <p>\"But we still have 138,000 troops there and are occupying a country. It hasn't changed. If it has changed, it's increased the violence in many areas. Then again, the press has [always] been in the lap of the administration, and once again it's playing its role of lapdog.\" </p> <p>CBS News executive McGinnis denies that charge. \"We have 22 minutes [on the \"CBS Evening News\"] and we pick and choose the stories each night. We make subjective editorial choices every single day, and we're not making them on how to help or hurt George Bush or John Kerry. The decisions [about Iraq] are based on what's happening in Iraq that day.\" </p> <p>Of course, major news organisations are still covering Iraq and spending extraordinary resources - both human and financial - to keep Americans informed. The major dailies, as well as the nightly network news broadcasts, still dutifully report the developments in Iraq. On August 6, for instance, USA Today ran a long Page 1 account about new fighting in Iraq, while \"NBC Nightly News\" opened its broadcast with a similar report. </p> <p>But since the hand-over in Iraq, a certain intensity, or urgency, has been missing from the coverage - a reluctance to go beyond the day's random bombings, kidnappings and shootings. </p> <p>To be sure, the 24-hour cable shows are the news outlets that have ratcheted down their Iraq reporting the most over the past six weeks. That became glaringly obvious during the Democratic national convention in Boston, where many pundits and producers spent much of the time ignoring the politics and bemoaning how little actual news there was to report. </p> <p>Yet here's a small sampling of what happened in Iraq that same week, little of which was deemed newsworthy enough to seriously interrupt the endless, repetitive cable TV discussion about swing voters and Teresa Heinz Kerry's \"shove it\" remark: </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> July 26: Attackers shot and killed Iraq's senior interior ministry official and two of his bodyguards in a drive-by shooting. <br> <b>\u00b7</b> July 26: A suicide bomber detonated a car filled with explosives, mortars and rockets near the gates of a US base in Mosul, killing three. <br> <b>\u00b7</b> July 27: The dead body of a kidnapped Turkish truck driver was found. <br> <b>\u00b7</b> July 27: One Iraqi was killed and 14 coalition soldiers were injured when a mortar hit a Baghdad residential district. <br> <b>\u00b7</b> July 28: A car bomb exploded on a busy boulevard in Baquba, killing 68 people and wounding nearly 100. The attack stood as the deadliest insurgent strike since the US occupation began last year. <br> <b>\u00b7</b> July 28: Seven Iraqi soldiers and 35 insurgents were killed during a firefight in Suwariyah. <br> <b>\u00b7</b> July 29: Reeling from the violence and a wave of kidnappings, Iraqi officials once again postponed a three-day national conference to choose an interim assembly in preparation for the country's first elections. </p> <p>Experts say that week was typical of the chaos that has transpired in Iraq this summer, with or without the spotlight of the US press shining on the region. \"Iraq remains very much in the balance. That's the only fair assessment you can make right now,\" says Brookings' Singer. \"I've talked to friends who served in the CPA, and I don't know anybody with on-the-ground experience in Iraq who doesn't think the situation there isn't completely screwed up,\" adds Cook. </p> <p>\"Iraqis are so embittered and [have] completely lost any faith in us, even the most pro-American Iraqis,\" says the Philadelphia Inquirer's Dilanian, who says he has had a profound change of heart on the topic. </p> <p>Last April, fresh from reporting in Iraq, an optimistic Dilanian wrote that the press was ignoring improvements in Iraq and underplaying the chance for a real turnaround. In late June he returned to Baghdad to cover the sovereignty handover. </p> <p>Summing up his new grim impressions in an August 1 article, Dilanian admitted his earlier prediction was wrong and wrote, \"The situation in Iraq right now is not as bad as the news media are portraying it to be. It's worse. Most Iraqis aren't seeing the improvements they had hoped for, and they're not blaming the guerrillas - they're blaming the Americans. Sovereignty seems to have had zero effect on this equation.\" </p> <p>That's the key story many American news outlets have missed since June 28. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Eric Boehlert is a senior writer at Salon.</p> <p>This article has been provided by Salon through a special arrangement with Guardian Newspapers Limited. \u00a9 Salon.com 2004 <br> Visit the Salon site at <a href=\"http://www.salon.com\">www.salon.com</a></p>",
  "The drama of Richard Nixon's resignation 30 years ago this month has long overshadowed his political achievement. Nixon's criminal White House seemed an aberrant episode rooted in only his pathologies. But Nixon was the father of the modern Republican party. <p>It was Nixon who created a brand-new coalition of Southern conservatism in reaction to the civil rights movement. He absorbed the Dixiecrat followers of George C Wallace - urban ethnic Catholics and white-collar suburbanites fearful of racial turmoil and the breakdown of law and order and resentful of student protests, assertive women and the loosening of social mores; and he shifted the locus of power in the Republican party from the north-east and midwest to California, the south-west and Florida. Nixon's natural cynicism allowed him to juggle the volatile elements that gelled for Ronald Reagan. </p> <p>By the time of Nixon's election in 1968, the Democratic coalition had cracked up under the stress of race and Vietnam. Now the Republican party that came to power is exhausted. It has lost political impetus. Its instability, contradictions and anachronisms have been apparent for more than a decade, since Clinton's victory in 1992. </p> <p>George Bush did not make a new coalition or offer a refreshed Republicanism, despite the trope of \"compassionate conservatism\". He came to power as a result only of a flawed Democratic strategy in 2000, and even then he lost the popular majority and had to rely upon a skewed supreme court to install him in office. Before 9/11, after only nine months, his presidency was winding down, and he lost the Senate with the defection of a Republican. The war on terror was a substitute for old Republican anti-communism, the ultimate glue holding disparate elements together. Still, the party is coming unstuck, disintegrating in its historic base. </p> <p>California, the home state of Nixon and Reagan, has disappeared from the Republican coalition. Its demographic transformations, especially the ever expanding Hispanic electorate (two-to-one Democratic), postindustrial economy and social liberalism, make it a forerunner of the future. Bush is so far behind in California that there is no campaign there whatsoever. </p> <p>To win elections in general, Bush must raise his percentage of Hispanic votes from 35% in 2000 to close to 40%. But, according to a recent Democracy Corps poll, he is five points below his 2000 level and seven down in the south-west and Florida. </p> <p>In Illinois, a former presidential bellwether, the Republican party has fallen off the map. In his famous 1960 victory, Kennedy won the state, with 65% in Chicago. The Chicago suburbs, two-to-one Republican as recently as 1988, have now begun to tilt Democratic (just as have the suburbs of Los Angeles). Meanwhile, the state Republican party has imploded: unable to find a credible Senate candidate against the star of the Democratic convention, Barack Obama, it has now come up with its own African-American, Alan Keyes. A screeching religious right fanatic, Keyes, who has worn a lapel pin featuring the feet of a foetus, is Jerry Falwell as played by Little Richard. Obama is beating him 67-28, undoubtedly Keyes's peak. </p> <p>The turn in Michigan is, if anything, even more distressing for Republicans. West Michigan, home to Nixon's successor Gerald Ford and even today unrepresented by any Democrats in Congress, has John Kerry 12 points above Bush in a poll taken by a local TV station. This collapse is a consequence largely of the desertion of moderate Republicans repulsed by Bush's reckless economic mismanagement and neoconservative foreign policy. These moderates are overwhelmingly mainline Protestants, also offended by Bush's evangelical culture war and faith-based efforts to break down the wall of separation between church and state. </p> <p>The party that Nixon built is crumbling. Bush is the candidate of canned talking points and a party whose instincts have become rote and often counterproductive. The \"war president\" wraps himself in the flag, but the latest code-orange terrorist alert aroused no rally-round-the-flag syndrome; instead, it raised questions about Bush's timing and handling. Rather than campaign on his record, he has challenged Kerry to justify his vote for the Iraq war resolution, and when Kerry explained his reasoning accused him of \"nuance\". How can Bush change the subject? </p> <p>With independent voters bleeding away from him, he has taken to stumping with the maverick Republican senator John McCain, his mortal enemy. Can Bush dump Cheney without being seen as desperate and repudiating his entire term? Bush's father owed his political career to Nixon's patronage; now the son is in danger of inheriting the wind. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Sidney Blumenthal, a former senior adviser to President Clinton, is Washington bureau chief of <a href=\"http://www.salon.com\">salon.com</a> </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:sidney_blumenthal@yahoo.com\">sidney_blumenthal@yahoo.com</a></p>",
  "Why must it always be Sweden?\" groaned Quentin Hogg 40 years ago. Back then, it was assumed that the answer to every British political problem was to adopt the Nordic country's modish practices. The British right was gripped by its post-Suez crisis of confidence, and the left by the Private Eye/John Pilger view that politics was about betrayal in government. Not much has changed since then: political ideologues still want to find salvation everywhere except in their own country. <p>In the 1990s, the Conservative foreign affairs specialist, David Howell, wrote panegyrics about the rise of Asia - until the crash of 1998 and the continuing no-growth in Japan made his arguments look silly. In the 1970s, the Conservatives were obsessed with Europe. Margaret Thatcher won in 1979 and 1983 as a Euro-fanatic urging Britain to adopt continental capitalism as the model to bury British socialism.</p> <p>More recently, the United States has become the only role model for most right-wing intellectuals, as well as some in New Labour. Arguing against the American faction in British politics, those such as Will Hutton and David Marquand tell us that social democratic happiness has been obtained across the Channel. For them, only a lack of faith prevents a Labour government from signing up for their preferred version of a better world to be found beyond our shores.</p> <p>This lack of confidence in Britain and the belief that there is a Harry Potter politics of potions from overseas is a factor in limiting debate about political options. The latest manifestation of this latter-day version of John Osborne's polemic, Damn You, England, are the appeals from Martin Jacques and Philip Dodd, two of the cleverest analysts of the political-cultural changes of their generation, to look east. Forget, England, Britain and Europe; the only future lies in China and India, they say.</p> <p>Yet from abroad the view seems quite different. From European capitals, Britain is seen as rising to the difficult challenges of the global economy and post-deferential multicultural society. Trade unions in Europe are haemorrhaging members. Not so in Britain. Continental health and education systems are facing budget cuts; the reverse in Britain. Mass unemployment dominates political and fiscal choices in Italy, France and Germany. Full employment combined with redistributive fiscal policy allows Britain to be generous across a range of public spending from overseas aid to the explosion of non-metropolitan culture. </p> <p>No other European city or region can match what is on offer at the Edinburgh Festival or the Proms. No other European broadcasting gets close to the BBC for range and excellence. The continental press was almost embarrassing in its praise for the success of Britain's European policy. In contrast to the permanent Europhobia of the tabloids and Euro-cyncism of the London salons, the Paris, Berlin and Madrid papers argue that London is the major influence in shaping the new constitutional treaty, the new job-focused economic thinking and the new foreign and defence policies of Europe. </p> <p>Whenever I am in the US, I find nothing but praise from business for how the NHS relieves employers from paying out ever-increasing health insurance costs. Americans admired Margaret Thatcher but they adore Tony Blair. If I could have a dollar for every American who on hearing my English accent has told me they wished the prime minister was president of the US, I could restore the Labour party's financial fortunes. </p> <p>Neoconservative commentators such as Charles Krauthammer attack Britain's foreign policy positions because we seek joint EU positions on problems like Iran, Kyoto, world trade talks, the international criminal court, and seeing off of US protectionism on steel tariffs. In Washington, Britain is seen as a leading European nation defending EU positions while accepting global responsibilities. </p> <p>Iraq is a continuing problem. Yet opposing the use of force to remove Saddam has not helped other leaders in Europe in terms of domestic political standing. John Kerry has made clear that, far from pulling US troops out of Iraq, he expects Europeans to become more involved in helping the Iraqi people. Labour, as Neal Lawson and Paul Thompson of Renewal rightly point out, did poorly in the European parliament elections. But the ruling parties in France and Germany did even worse in terms of loss of votes, and in Britain the opposition, the Conservatives, did worse than the government. Labour has a problem with renewing the party, but it is far from clear that betraying trade unions and other democrats in Iraq, or big income tax increases, would do the trick.</p> <p>Writing off Labour governments is a condition of being a left intellectual. Bevin and Attlee, as well as Wilson and Callaghan, enjoyed the scorn of the British intelligentsia but still imposed reforms that lasted. But the last three did not bring in a minimum wage, legislate trade union recognition, promote black and Muslim Britons to high office, create a Scottish parliament and government, or abolish hereditary peers. Giddy with what they perceived as success, Labour governments in the last century did not take the threat of a Tory revival seriously, or rein in rhetoric that alienated voters. As a result, premature ejection from power became a Labour speciality. </p> <p>Today, the left is being invited to stop believing in itself and in Britain. We are told that over the horizon there is a country which we should embrace, or ape. According to Lawson and Thompson, around the corner there is a real social democracy which, by ripping apart the present Labour government, will transform Britain for ever. Yet successful democratic left advance in Europe, or under the New Deal in America, has demanded a politics of compromise, confidence and calm belief that solutions can be found from within rather than hope for a model from abroad.</p> <p>To be sure, progressive theory and practice needs renewing internationally. Yet the British left should be more confident in Britain and our capacity to take forward the permanent reformism begun in 1997, which has done much for our nation, and which many in other parts of the world would willingly copy.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Denis MacShane is Labour MP for Rotherham and minister for Europe</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:macshaned@parliament.uk\">macshaned@parliament.uk</a></p>",
  "Most legends contain a small grain of truth, but none is to be found in the fraudulent images being presented each day by the BBC (and the US networks). The print media is not much better. Official propaganda is constantly repeated in sentences such as: \"On June 28 the United States and its coalition partners transferred sovereign control of Iraq to an interim government headed by prime minister Ayad Allawi. The transfer of sovereignty ended more than a year of American-led occupation\". <p>Meanwhile, US intelligence agencies admit that the size of the resistance increases every day. If Moqtada al-Sadr were to be captured or killed in the fighting taking place in Najaf, the steady trickle of recruits could become a flood. In such a situation and with no official opposition to the occupation in the Commons it should be the responsibility of the media to ensure that some truth, at least, is regularly reported. </p> <p>The capitulation of the BBC has been in evidence ever since the Hutton whitewash. This is not just a question of journalists censoring themselves. Earlier this summer the new director-general Mark Thompson reportedly told a meeting of the corporation's news board there was a \"perception\" that BBC news was too leftwing and critical of the government - a perception which needed to be corrected. He must be happy now. </p> <p>The notion that Iraq today is a sovereign state governed by Iraqis is a grotesque fiction. Every Iraqi citizen, regardless of political views or religious affiliation, is aware of the actual status of the country. And if the BBC carries on in this fashion, its credibility, already at an all-time low, could disappear altogether. Condoleezza Rice, the US national security adviser, declared some months back: \"We want to change the Iraqi mind.\" But the US-funded Arab TV channel called Truth has proved a dismal failure. And now, to prevent any alternative images from reaching Iraqis and the rest of the world, a plucky puppet at the \"ministry of information\" has banned al-Jazeera TV from reporting out of Iraq - a traditional recipe from an oppressive cookbook. </p> <p>The \"handover\", designed largely to convince US citizens that they could now relax and re-elect Bush, was also an invitation to the western media to downgrade coverage of Iraq, which it dutifully did. As Paul Krugman noted in the New York Times last week: \"Iraq stories moved to the inside pages of newspapers, and largely off TV screens. Many people got the impression that things had improved. Even journalists were taken in: newspaper stories asserted that the rate of US losses there fell after the hand-off. (Actual figures: 42 American soldiers died in June, and 54 in July).\" </p> <p>Like previous confections to justify the war, this one is not working either. Of the two Iraqis plucked from obscurity to be the front men for the occupation, \"President\" Yawar is a relatively harmless telecoms manager from Saudi Arabia. He was perfectly happy to don tribal gear for official functions and photo ops with Rumsfeld and the boys. \"Prime minister\" Allawi was at one time a low-grade intelligence employee for Saddam, reporting on dissident Iraqis in London. Subsequently, Anglo-American intelligence outfits recruited him. After the first Gulf war he was sent to destabilise the regime. His hirelings bombed a cinema and a bus carrying children. </p> <p>Before the war Allawi helped manufacture the 45-minute WMD delivery systems warning for the dodgy dossier men in No 10. After the occupation he was rewarded and put on the \"governing council\". He then hired a lobbying firm, which spent $370,000 campaigning in Washington for him to be made prime minister, and also got him a column in the Washington Post. </p> <p>As \"prime minister\" he cultivates a thuggish image. On July 17 in a remarkable despatch from Baghdad, Paul McGeough, the Australian correspondent, (and former editor of the Sydney Morning Herald) alleged: \"Iyad Allawi, the new prime minister of Iraq, pulled a pistol and executed as many as six suspected insurgents at a Baghdad police station, just days before Washington handed control of the country to his interim government, according to two people who allege they witnessed the killings. </p> <p>\"They say the prisoners - handcuffed and blindfolded - were lined up against a wall in a courtyard adjacent to the maximum-security cell block in which they were held at the al-Amariyah security centre ... They say Dr Allawi told onlookers the victims had each killed as many as 50 Iraqis and they 'deserved worse than death'.\" </p> <p>McGeough's report continued: \"The prime minister's office has denied the entirety of the witness accounts in a written statement ... saying Dr Allawi had never visited the centre and he did not carry a gun. But the informants told the Herald that Dr Allawi shot each young man in the head as about a dozen Iraqi policemen and four Americans from the prime minister's personal security team watched in stunned silence.\" McGeough appears regularly on TV and radio to defend his story, which does not go away. </p> <p>The fact is that Iraq is in a much bigger mess today than before the war. The situation was summed up by a former inmate of Abu Ghraib prison: \"We want electricity in our homes, not up the arse.\" </p> <p>The citizens of the aggressor states can see this for themselves and regardless of the media will, one must hope, punish their leaders for taking them to war - regardless of the fact that the alternatives on offer are so weak. In the US, Senator Kerry is an unconvincing politician. Unlike some of his liberal apologists, he does not like to portray the Democrats as the consistently less aggressive of the two parties. It was, after all, Democratic - not Republican - presidents who launched the wars in Korea and Vietnam. The Republican Eisenhower's electoral appeal in 1952 was based on being the more peaceful of the two candidates. In 1960 Kennedy attacked the Republi cans for the \"missile gap\", denouncing their weakness before the Soviet threat. Carter, not Reagan, launched the second cold war. And in 1992 Clinton was thundering against Bush senior's weakness on Cuba and China. Now Bush junior has outpaced any Democratic rival in accelerated militarism. But it is enough to remember that on the eve of 9/11, Hillary Clinton and Joseph Lieberman organised a letter, signed by nearly every Democratic senator, denouncing Bush's Middle East policies. They wanted more support for Israel. </p> <p>It is necessary to bear this record in mind, as pressure has built up for the US left to fall into line behind Kerry. Many will, understandably enough, vote for him to get rid of a warmonger government. If they succeed, he must be put under immediate pressure to withdraw from Iraq. If there had been no resistance in Iraq, the triumphalism of warmongers would have drowned out oppositions of every hue. The defeat of the warmongers, if it happens, will be the outcome of what is happening in Baghdad and Basra, Falluja and Najaf. Even if they try and brush aside the 37,000 Iraqi civilians killed in this conflict, according to a recent estimate by an Iraq-based NGO, Bush and Blair will not forget the names of the cities whose people refuse to surrender. There is only one serious option: the unconditional withdrawal of foreign troops from Iraq. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> An updated paperback edition of Tariq Ali's book, Bush in Babylon: the Recolonisation of Iraq, is published by Verso next month </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:tariq.ali3@btinternet.com\">tariq.ali3@btinternet.com</a></p>"
