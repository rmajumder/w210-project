  "John Kerry has fallen behind in the three biggest swing states - Florida, Pennsylvania and Ohio - which pollsters from both parties believe will be the key to the US presidential election, it emerged yesterday. <p>Polling figures suggest that George Bush's surge in support after the Republican convention has settled into a significant lead, confronting John Kerry with difficult tactical choices as he battles to regain the initiative. </p> <p>A poll by Time magazine showed the president on 52%, with the Democratic challenger on 41%. This is as wide a lead as Mr Bush enjoyed in the immediate aftermath of the New York convention. Newsweek magazine, however, found the Bush margin had diminished to six percentage points in the past week. </p> <p>To some extent, the varying results reflect differing polling methods. Time based its results on likely voters, identified by a number of questions on their voting background and intentions. The Newsweek survey looked at all registered voters. </p> <p>But the common theme is that the president's advantage has outlasted the hoopla of the Republican rally. The trend is also moving against Mr Kerry in the most closely-contested swing states. </p> <p>The conventional wisdom among pollsters in both camps has been that whoever wins two out of the three biggest swing states - Florida, Pennsylvania and Ohio - will win the election. Mr Kerry is currently behind in all three: Ohio by eight percentage points, Florida by four points, and Pennsylvania by one point. </p> <p>\"It's clear this is more than a 'bounce',\" said Andrew Kohut, the head of the Pew Research Centre, an independent polling organisation in Washington. </p> <p>\"Kerry has clearly underperformed. He's lost the first round, but the question becomes, how stable is the Bush lead - and we don't know that yet. There are still a lot of variables, like what happens in Iraq and the candidates' performance in the debates, so there are still opportunities for Kerry.\" </p> <p>However, over the past two weeks, there has been a shift in voters' perceptions of both candidates. More than half of the US electorate now has a favourable opinion of Mr Bush, according to the Newsweek survey. Meanwhile, Mr Kerry's favourable ratings, at 48%, have yet to recover from the battering he suffered from Republican speakers at the convention. </p> <p>The polling results have also shown that the Republican convention \"reset\" the election agenda, at least for now. Terrorism has become the top issue for voters, displacing concerns about the economy and healthcare, which took precedence until August. </p> <p>The nationwide shift in public opinion has been reflected in the roughly 20 swing states where the daily battle is being fought. </p> <p>States like Virginia, Arizona and Missouri, where Mr Kerry believed he had a serious chance a month ago, now appear to be solidly behind the president, potentially gaining Mr Bush crucial votes in the 538-seat electoral college that formally picks the president after the election. </p> <p>In the light of all the latest state polls, the bloc of states backing the president accounted for 168 electoral college votes, and the states solidly behind Mr Kerry carried 146, with 224 votes up for grabs - from states that were either tied or where the margin between the candidates was less than the margin of error. A total of 270 votes is required to win. </p> <p>The Kerry campaign is focusing its advertising expenditure on a smaller and smaller group of states, and has committed itself to regaining the initiative in Ohio, where it believes high unemployment should make it open to Mr Kerry's job creation ideas and other social spending programmes. </p> <p>However, that takes money away from the defence of traditionally Democratic states such as Wisconsin, Iowa, Washington and Oregon, where the president is making a serious challenge, and which are too close to call. </p> <p>The Kerry camp insists that the battle is far from over. Much bigger leads have been overturned in the last 50 days of a campaign, and the debates can be decisive in a tight race. The Kerry campaign has agreed to all three presidential debates suggested by a public commission, starting at the end of this month. The Bush negotiating team is arguing for just two. </p> <p>For Democrats, the persistently hopeful sign to emerge from all the polling data is that America remains a disgruntled country. In the Newsweek survey, 53% of voters said they were dissatisfied with \"the way things are going\" in the US. Only 39% said they were satisfied. </p> <p>Faced with that widespread discontent, both candidates are marketing themselves as agents of change - a normal strategy for a challenger, but a harder task for an incumbent with four years in office behind him. Nevertheless, Mr Bush is attempting the gambit, repeatedly describing his agenda as a response to \"changing times\" - and his opponent's platform as \"more of the same\".</p>",
  "<b> Washington Post</b> <br> Editorial, September 13 <p> \"The agonising difficulties in Iraq give rise to two legitimate questions: was the war a mistake, and what is to be done now? The second is the more vital, but both are important subjects for the campaign. President George Bush has unambiguous answers ... But it isn't clear where Senator John Kerry stands on either point. Mr Kerry got pretty badly battered by friend and foe alike a couple of weeks back when he said he would still, knowing everything he knows now, have voted to authorise war in Iraq ... Now Mr Kerry says that Iraq was 'the wrong war in the wrong place at the wrong time' ... </p> <p>\"He ... seems to be trying to give the impression that he is opposed to the war, without actually saying so. He talks about bringing troops home in six months but resists pressure, including within his own campaign, to commit to such a withdrawal. It is to his credit that he resists taking such an irresponsible position. But his stance does not help Americans understand where he would really lead the nation and US troops in Iraq.\" </p> <p><b> Nicholas von Hoffman</b><br> New York Observer, September 13 </p> <p> \"Mr Kerry's critique of Mr Bush's war ... has been fumbling, ambiguous, unfocused and unconvincing. He gives the impression of a politician who is hiding his real intentions ... It makes tactical political sense for Mr Kerry not to attack the Iraq war head on, as the Howard Dean people might like, but ... Mr Kerry must separate himself from Mr Bush. He has chosen not to do it by attacking Mr Bush for having invaded Iraq, so he had better find another way of distinguishing himself from his opponent. That way is to go after Mr Bush for his no-win, war-forever strategy.\" </p> <p><b> Jules Witcover</b><br> Baltimore Sun, September 10 </p> <p> \"Mr Kerry seems finally to have recognised that the election of 2004 is about the war in Iraq and how Mr Bush has conducted it ... Mr Kerry's ham-handed explanations of his vote for the Bush war resolution, and particularly his foolish statement that even had he known no weapons of mass destruction would be found he would have voted as he did, have severely compromised his ability to challenge Mr Bush on the war. But politically he will be better off continuing the course he embarked on [last] week, attacking the 'catastrophic choices' he says the president made in launching his pre-emptive war without broader support from the international community ... </p> <p>\"Mr Kerry needs to hammer at the cost of a ... failing policy in Iraq that demands new leadership, and he needs to say much more clearly and persuasively how he will provide it.\" </p> <p><b> St Louis Post-Dispatch</b><br> Editorial, September 12 </p> <p> \"Last week, the chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff ... acknowledged that significant portions of Iraq have turned into 'no-go zones' for US and Iraqi troops ... [Yet] Mr Kerry has been as inept in his criticism of the Bush Iraq policy as Mr Bush has been in its execution. </p> <p>\"Mr Kerry has a cogent critique of Mr Bush rushing to war without important allies or a realistic plan for peace. But Mr Kerry's proposal to bring the troops home over four years ... is like Richard Nixon proposing a plan for four more years of Americans dying in Vietnam.\" </p> <p><b> Ruben Navarrette</b><br> Chicago Tribune, September 10 </p> <p> \"The Kerry supporters have been much too accommodating, and that has only made their candidate sloppy. Early on in the campaign, Mr Kerry made a big deal out of the fact that no WMD had been found in Iraq, and he even said in his acceptance speech that the only justification for going to war was to protect Americans against 'a threat that was real and imminent'. His supporters applauded. Then, a few weeks later, a reporter asked him ... if he knew at the time of his vote that we wouldn't find WMD, would he have still voted to authorise the invasion of Iraq and the ouster of Saddam? Mr Kerry said 'yes'. And his supporters applauded some more.\" </p> <p><b> San Francisco Chronicle</b><br> Editorial, September 10 </p> <p> \"Mr Kerry is sharpening his criticism of Mr Bush's handling of the war in Iraq - and not a moment too soon. Many Democrats were growing anxious about the Bush team's effectiveness in defining Mr Kerry and framing the terms of the debate about national security. In recent days, Mr Kerry has brought in new advisers and instilled a new tone of urgency in his rhetoric after seeing Mr Bush surge in the polls during and after the Republican national convention.\" </p> <p><b> Peter Brown</b><br> Orlando Sentinel, September 10 </p> <p> \"Mr Kerry risks reinforcing the view held by tens of millions of Americans, including some who favour him, that he changes his mind almost as often as his underwear ...<br> ... He is either indecisive or an unprincipled politician who will say or do anything to get elected. </p> <p>\"The change is apparently based on the sage advice from aides - many of whom were the same folks who helped Michael Dukakis lose a 17-point lead over George HW Bush in 1988 - that his road to victory now lies in criticising the president's policies, even if Mr Kerry had similar ones just weeks ago. The Bush folks can hardly contain their glee.\"</p>",
  "<b>The following clarification was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Wednesday September 15</b> <br> In the column below we say that from the polls we can learn, among other things, that \"Kerry is winning in the war on Iraq (50%-36%) but Bush wins on the war against terror (66%-25%)\". The Zogby pollsters themselves say: \"Kerry leads among those who say that their top issues are jobs and the economy (50%-39%), education (48%-37%), the war in Iraq (50%-36%), and healthcare (50%-34%). But, among those who say that the 'war on terrorism' is their top concern, Bush leads by 41 points (66%-25%). Right now all the talk is on the 'war on terrorism.' Kerry has to change the talk.\"     In a sense, of course, it's their election, not ours. To write about it is to risk damnation of the hellfire variety. \"You disgusting, arrogant British piece of shit,\" emailed a certain Mr Rokhsar of optonline.com the last time I looked at Bush and Kerry. \"No wonder we think all British are scum.\" That gentleman is not alone in his loathing (or, Tony Blair might reflect, his ingratitude). American exceptionalism slams doors in many faces. <p>But this time, seriously, we have reason to keep knocking on those doors. This time we on the outside are one of the inside issues. </p> <p>For the big Bush idea, earnestly repeated on stump after stump, is to make our world safer and happier by making it more democratic. One person, one grin. And those of us who've spent decades immersed in American politics can see much general, good-hearted sense in that. Democratic nations (at least until last year) tend not to go to war without good reason. Ordinary voting people, left to themselves, are the wisest arbiters we have. Relative freedom works better than autocracy or religious zealotry. </p> <p>So take the president at his word. Let Iraq, Iran, Syria, Afghanistan and the rest import their ballot boxes and train their single transferable mullahs. Let's gently squeeze aside the leftover colonels, manipulative ayatollahs and corrupt monarchies. Farewell, Mubarak, Assad and (yes!) the House of Saud. Let's give democracy its chance. It may be a stance too interventionist, a panacea too pre-emptive, but at least the theory has benign resonance. Baghdad and Kabul, over the next few months, have great trails to blaze. </p> <p>But then you hop from the high-minded general to the particulars of current campaigning - and canyons of incredulity begin to yawn. Is the other big issue whether, three-and-a-half decades ago, John Kerry inflicted a light flesh wound upon himself in order to win another Purple Heart and thereafter campaign against a war he'd volunteered to fight in? Or is it, rather, that George Bush, who supported that war, at least on paper, ducked out of serving (like his bellicose vice-president and Bill Clinton) and went strangely Awol in Alabama? </p> <p>You can, and should, answer: neither of the above. Kerry was right to rail against the bloody, chastening ordeal of Vietnam - and is equally dotty to hymn its undoubted heroics now. What George did when he was on the sauce isn't remotely relevant to four more White House years. It was all a very long time ago. It doesn't matter a damn. </p> <p>And yet, of course, it seems that it does. The tide has turned against the Democrats with startling suddenness over three short weeks. The pundits are already beginning to fold their tents and shrug. When the going gets rough, then a tough man called Karl Rove gets going: a smear a day keeps depression at bay. </p> <p>Does that faze US politics junkies? Of course not. It is, on the contrary, part of the weird and wonderful allure of the American way. Even famously liberal Washington journalists, self- confessed voters for Kerry this time, say that the Bush boys fuel better copy and bigger headlines. They make an each-way bet and play a game that, for all its supposed portent, for all the usual stuff about defining moments, is still just that: a game; a savage war of words in which only egos and bank balances get wounded. </p> <p>But what do they make of that in Najaf's markets? Do they see a shining city on the hill or a dirty old town sinking in the mud? What are they learning about mighty, exportable democracy in action? </p> <p>There are indeed things to learn from the interstices of the current polls, from Gallup and Zogby and the Democrats' own samplings. That Kerry is winning on the war in Iraq (50%-36%) but Bush wins on the war against terror (66%-25%). That Bush would make America \"stronger at home\", but Kerry would \"make it more respected in the world\". That Kerry still edges ahead on health, education and the economy - Blair's own \"real issues\" - but that Bush's \"decisiveness\" increasingly leaves him trailing overall. That although a clear majority doesn't \"like the direction the US is heading in\" under the Republicans, it is still intent on going down that disliked path. </p> <p>The sum of all this, for the moment, is profound incoherence, both internal and external. Are Iraq and the war on terror truly separate issues moving in separate directions? No resident of Baghdad, looking out of his back window, could suppose so. Doesn't strength in the world also automatically mean strength at home? Isn't a vibrant economy the essential of every success? </p> <p>Kerry and Edwards, for what they're worth, are losing this contest - the \"undecideds\" splitting against them - because they haven't got their terrorism act together. Nobody seems to have read the 9/11 commission report and found that Bin Laden isn't Saddam. A \"war\" president issues orders, and voters - like most of the media - meekly follow him. Bin Laden in the shadows is George Bush's best recruiting sergeant when Dick Cheney plays fife and drum. </p> <p>That's not a baleful verdict. So far, in a rather inert campaign, Kerry probably deserves to lose. So far, he hasn't staked out different ground clearly enough. So far, the snarls have it over the mumbles. But there is a wider imperative, growing insistently. </p> <p>This, Bush says, is his last election. This is his last chance to show us how it's done. With soft-money ads and surrogate slurs and grotesque simplifications cooked in political hothouses? Is that the way? Is that what Cuba and Libya, not to mention the rest of us, have to look forward to? It isn't entirely arrogant to hope for something a bit less scummy than that. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:p.preston@theguardian.com\">p.preston@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, responded today to a spate of deadly terrorist attacks by announcing political changes that would strengthen the Kremlin's hold on power while weakening regional governments and independent politicians. <p>Mr Putin told a joint meeting of government and governors from Russia's 89 regions that he wanted a new election law to limit the number of political parties and to have full control over nominating regional leaders. He also called for the creation of a central and powerful anti-terror agency. </p> <p>\"The organisers and perpetrators of the terror attacks are aiming at the disintegration of the state, the break up of Russia,\" he said. \"We need a single organisation capable of not only dealing with terror attacks but also working to avert them, destroy criminals in their hideouts, and if necessary, abroad.\" </p> <p>Mr Putin's declaration followed a series of terror attacks blamed on Chechen rebels, climaxing in the three-day school siege in North Ossetia in which more than 330 people, half of them children, died. </p> <p>Mr Putin has been criticised for strengthening his own powers in the past, although three weeks of violence and the deaths of 430 people have led nervous, angry Russians to voice increased support for measures to combat terrorism. </p> <p>Political opponents, however, accused him of exploiting the school siege to shore up his own position. </p> <p>\"Such proposals have nothing to do with the security of people or fighting terrorism,\" liberal MP Vladimir Ryzhkov said. \"The Kremlin is simply using the momentum.\"</p> <p>Mr Putin identified the Caucasus region, of which Chechnya is part, as a \"springboard\" for terrorism, and named one of his closest confidants, cabinet chief of staff Dmitry Kozak, to represent him in the southern area of the Russian federation that includes the Caucasus. </p> <p>Announcing electoral changes that would give the already dominant pro-Kremlin faction in parliament even greater power, he also proposed a purely proportional voting system that would eliminate the individual races that now fill half the seats in the Duma. </p> <p>Mr Ryzhkov, one of the few opposition MPs in Russia lower house of parliament, said that if Mr Putin's proposals were approved, \"the next Duma will be simply virtual, it will consist of just marionette party lists and won't enjoy any authority\". </p> <p>Mr Putin, who has already significantly curtailed the powers of regional governors, said that he would introduce legislation by the end of the year that would further reform the way regional legislatures elect their governors. The move appeared to signal he was intent on eliminating any vestiges of the governors' autonomy.</p> <p>Sergei Markov, a political analyst with close ties to the Kremlin, said the president's move could help curb corruption that has flourished in some regions. \"At the same time, it means ... a lowering of [their] general political authority and a serious lowering of political pluralism,\" Mr Markov told Ekho Moskvy radio. </p> <p>Mr Putin also hinted that a government may begin a crackdown on Islamic groups, proposing that extremist organisations serving as a cover for terrorists should be outlawed. </p> <p>A new structure called the Public Chamber would strengthen public oversight of the government and the actions of law enforcement agencies, he said. The chamber would involve non-governmental organisations and other groups in the fight against terror. </p> <p>Over the weekend, Mr Putin ordered the interior minister in North Ossetia to be sacked, and fired the regional head of the Federal Security Service, the agency that is supposed to spearhead anti-terrorist efforts. Those moves followed a meeting with his security council yesterday. </p> <p>Mr Putin said today that terrorism is rooted in the low living standards in the North Caucasus, in widespread unemployment and in poor education. </p> <p>\"This is a rich fertile ground for the growth of extremist propaganda and the recruitment of new supporters of terror,\" Mr Putin said. \"The North Caucasus is a key strategic region for Russia. It is a victim of terrorism and also a springboard for it.\"</p>",
  "North Korea today invited a British diplomat to visit the site of a massive mushroom-cloud explosion that sparked fears the regime may have carried out a nuclear weapons test. <p>The North Koreans denied the blast was a nuclear test, insisting that it was part of the planned destruction of a mountain for a hydroelectric project. But Foreign Office minister Bill Rammell, on a visit to the secretive communist country, asked the authorities in the capital, Pyongyang, if British officials could see for themselves. </p> <p>Responding to the request, North Korea's vice-foreign minister for Europe, Kung Sok-ung, said Britain's ambassador to Pyongyang, David Slinn, could go to the site as early as tomorrow. </p> <p>Mr Rammell said: \"Having asked the vice-foreign minister this morning for our ambassador and other ambassadors to be allowed to visit the scene of the explosion, I am very pleased the North Koreans have agreed to the request.\" </p> <p>The blast near the Chinese border on Thursday caused a two-mile wide cloud of dust, which was picked up by satellite. A South Korean news agency said the blast was stronger than an April explosion that killed 160 people and injured an estimated 1,300 at a North Korean railway station when a train carrying oil and chemicals apparently hit power lines.</p> <p>In talks with Mr Rammell today, North Korea's foreign minister Paek Nam-sun said the blast was a controlled explosion that had nothing to do with nuclear weapons testing. He told Mr Rammell claims that it was a nuclear test or an accident similar to the train disaster were \"lies\". </p> <p>Earlier today, Mr Rammell told the BBC: \"If this is genuinely a deliberate detonation as part of a legitimate construction project then the North Koreans have nothing to fear and nothing to hide and should welcome the international community actually verifying the situation for themselves.\" </p> <p>China's government, which has the closest diplomatic relations with communist North Korea, made no immediate comment about the explosion. </p> <p>The remote border region of Ryanggang, where the latest blast happened, is understood to contain a secret missile base - prompting speculation in South Korea that it was a weapons-related accident. </p> <p>Kim Tae-woo, an analyst at the Korea Institute for Defence Analysis, told Reuters: \"Rodong missile bases are located in the blast area, and extremely explosive liquid fuel which is also very flammable is used in production and in operation of missiles. I believe it was a mere accident triggered by mishandling.\" </p> <p>South Korean officials are analysing satellite images and other data to determine the cause of the explosion.</p> <p>US officials, including the secretary of state, Colin Powell, have played down the possibility of a nuclear test. But the Democratic presidential candidate, Senator John Kerry, accused the Bush administration of letting a \"nuclear nightmare\" develop in North Korea, telling the New York Times that President George Bush was preoccupied with Iraq.</p>",
  "Welcome to the Wrap, Guardian Unlimited's round-up of the best of the day's papers. <p>Also in today's Wrap: The Blair-Brown saga, Hurricane Ivan's devastation and concerns about teenagers' mental health</p> <p><b>A BLACK DAY IN BAGHDAD</b></p> <p>When the FT's front page consists of three business stories, you might guess there's not much general news about. In fact, there's quite a bit, but today's papers are much more concerned with Blair-Brown speculation ahead of the TUC conference.</p> <p>With a picture and caption, the FT manages to squeeze Iraq onto its cover. The image is of an Iraqi man waving a flag over the burning remains of a US armoured personnel carrier. The caption tells us that 110 people died across Iraq in widespread violence yesterday, and that the man is a \"rebel\" celebrating a suspected car bomb attack in a \"Ba'athist stronghold\" area in Baghdad. The Guardian's report on the same incident is on page 2, but has none of the sangfroid of the FT's coverage. The Guardian says 13 Iraqis were killed when US helicopters fired on \"unarmed demonstrators\". It says an Arab journalist was killed. A Guardian journalist and a Reuters cameraman were also injured. </p> <p>Earlier in the weekend, the Times spoke to the Iraqi interim prime minister, Ayad Allawi. He told the paper that elections would go ahead in January, even if some areas, such as Falluja, had to be excluded because of ongoing unrest. </p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1303127,00.html\">Thirteen die in US attack on Baghdad crowd</a><br>* <a href=\"http://search.thetimes.co.uk/cgi-bin/ezk2srch?-aSTART#\">Times: Why I cannot give every Iraqi the vote</a></p> <p><b>11 INTO 10 WON\"T GO</b></p> <p>\"Today the political soap opera goes on tour,\" writes Jonathan Freedland in the Guardian, as conference season gets under way with the TUC's annual gathering. \"One storyline will loom larger than all the others.\" Yes, Wrap readers, prepare for even more stories about Tony and Gordon.</p> <p>The Guardian kicks off with a report about divisions between the Labour party and the unions, which means points dropped by Tony Blair. It says the \"big four\" union bosses have warned the prime minister, who addresses the TUC conference today, that \"policy concessions agreed in the summer\" had to be honoured. The areas addressed in a \"national policy forum\" in July were mostly employment rights and pensions. Significantly, the union leaders also got in a dig at Alan Milburn, the Blairite MP entrusted last week with the party's manifesto. They accused him of making \"wild statements and ideas\".</p> <p>The Daily Telegraph concurs, saying union bosses have said \"they would not tolerate interference by Mr Milburn\". It cites foundation hospitals as one of Mr Milburn's \"wild ideas\", and quotes Kate Hoey, a former Labour minister who says the foundation trusts are a \"mess\". \"On the back benches\", says Ms Hoey, \"there will be a feeling of why has [Mr Milburn] come back so soon, other than to show Gordon the prime minister is in charge.\"</p> <p>In case you worry Mr Blair is clocking up too many points, let's go back to the Guardian for a gleeful report on the prime minister's conceptual difficulties with economics. A former Downing Street adviser has published a book in which he says Mr Blair is a figure of fun at No 10 for his limited grasp of the subject. Apparently, a well-meaning official once attempted to give the prime minister some basic textbooks as holiday reading. The Guardian says this ties Mr Blair into a \"noble, if slightly amateurish tradition\" going back to Alec Douglas-Home. It says Mr Blair's holiday reading \"usually consists of worthy - but not academic - biographies\", while Mr Brown likes \"to immerse himself in the works of such heavyweight thinkers as Noam Chomsky\".</p> <p>There's none of this wide-eyed admiration for Mr Brown's intellectual abilities over at the Times. Next to a sinister cartoon of an eyeless chancellor being kept out of No 10 by a snarling Milburn-dog, William Rees-Mogg launches a blistering attack on Mr Brown's pensions policy, which he says \"has been one of the great disasters of British financial history\". And that's one of the nicer bits. He says Mr Brown has wrecked both state and private pensions, imposed stealth taxes and reduced the valuation of the stock market. \"He has impoverished generations of old people past, present and to come.\" No, I don't understand how he can impoverish the past either. In any case, Rees-Mogg concludes that demographics are against Mr Brown, as an ageing population means that at the next election nearly half of active voters will be pensioners. On the front page, the Times says national insurance contributions will have to rise by one-and-a-half pence in the pound to fund bigger state pensions, and that the prime minister is considering making contributions compulsory. The chancellor, says the paper, wants to wait until the next parliament to deal with the issue.</p> <p>So, with divisions multiplying in the Labour party, happy days for the Tories? Sorry, says the Daily Telegraph. Damian Green, an MP who resigned from the shadow cabinet last week, tells the paper Michael Howard is \"wilfully dividing the party by shifting it to the right\". Bizarrely the paper's leader comment then criticises embittered former shadow cabinet members who \"assist Downing Street in creating the impression of a 'lurch to the right\".

  "<p>The launch of a news site on the internet is hardly news, but when the former editor of the Observer unveils a service that bills itself as predicting the future, heads have inevitably turned in its direction. </p> <p>Jonathan Fenby can list working for Reuters, the Economist, the Guardian and South China Morning Post as well as the Observer during his long career, although his latest position as the editorial director of <a href=\"http://www.Earlywarning.com\">Earlywarning.com</a> is, he admits, the first time he has ever been involved with a branch of journalism that claims to tell people what is going to happen. </p> <p>\"There's so much news out there that tells you what's already happened,\" he says. \"So our basic principle is that we're there to look ahead. We don't just report on what's happening, we analyse it and so reveal what's going to happen. It's not futurology, we're keen to stick clear of using that term, because it normally means predicting weird and fancy things for 2020. We're far more short term and based on geopolitics. We won't just report on something, we write about the forces behind it and so predict it, rather than react to it.\" </p> <p>It may sound like gazing into a crystal ball but Fenby is adamant that the team behind Earlywarning.com are experts in their fields. Its publisher, Jonathan Humphrey, and editor, Robert Harvey, met Fenby when they all worked at the Economist. Hence the team is mature and well seasoned in publishing, which sets them apart from many younger journalists who have swapped print for silicon, although Fenby laughs at title of a \"silver surfer\", preferring the mantle of \"legacy asset\". </p> <p>This experienced group is backed up by content from more than 40 stringers. The articles are not going to be bylined but they'll generally be from someone who lives and writes in the country concerned who has got a great insight into what's going on behind the scenes,\" he says. \"A lot of the time they may not write a whole article but may tip us off to something which we then write. That way we've got experts spread across various subjects and many countries all feeding their insight into the site.\" </p> <p>Such expertise will cost. Although the site is offering a free month's trial subscription, thereafter access will cost $600 per year. Despite the potential price barrier, Fenby is convinced the site will attract sufficient subscribers. \"We think we're going to appeal to people in the media as well as people from official bodies who need to know what's going on around the world,\" he says. </p> <p>\"We're obviously also hoping to get a lot of subscriptions from business men and women who need to be up to date with events in their markets and those they may wish to enter. We realise that business people can use analysts to predict the number of goods they'll sell in different countries. We're not competing on that level, we're not about number crunching.\" </p> <p>But, as with any new service that launches online, those already operating in a similar field are keen to point out why the latest entrant will find the going far from easy. </p> <p>Oliver Greenwood, sales and marketing director at <a href=\"http://www.Noozz.com\">Noozz.com</a>, claims that his site is living testimony to the public - or more specifically, business people - being willing to pay for access to news. However, he is convinced that a service which only publishes its own articles and claims to predict the future may well be very brave but is also not headed for longevity. </p> <p>\"The people that will pay the money are usually business people who are very interested in getting very detailed information about a particular country or region,\" he says. </p> <p>\"They want to see what a variety of sources are saying about their industry and the country they are active in or hoping to target. That's why we put up articles from a variety of sources, including Reuters and the Economist, so they're getting a view from different angles. Earlywarning sounds very interesting but I can't see how people are going to pay money to see the world through one source rather than a variety.\" </p> <p>By using a single voice approach, Greenwood believes that Earlywarning will miss out on the discussion that can ensue from journalists from different backgrounds covering the same issue. </p> <p>\"Compare the average story on Iraq in an American paper with what appears in the French press and you'll see how world events are so open to interpretation,\" he maintains. \"That's why we think it's better to have a variety of sources so there's a discussion rather than one expert saying they not only know what has happened but they can tell by that what will happen. That's a pretty big claim to make.\" </p> <p>This is particularly true of emerging markets, he argues. While they are the area he has found business people are willing to pay a subscription for to read about, they are also changing so rapidly that predicting future events is almost impossible. </p> <p>Fenby is adamant, though, that there is space for a news site that does not buy in \"faceless\" copy from a wide variety of news agencies. While many people are happy to read assorted headlines collated by their ISP, he is confident there is a thirst for deeper knowledge of what is behind world events than is made available by aggregator sites that do what he calls \"a Yahoo\". </p> <p>Shoba Purushothaman, president and founder of <a href=\"http://www.TheNewsMarket.com\">TheNewsMarket.com</a>, disagrees. She put years of journalism at newspapers such as the Wall Street Journal to use by founding her company which has a niche in supplying video news content around the world. </p> <p>\"It sounds like they've given themselves a very lofty mission,\" she warns. \"It's going to be very tough because they're up against a lot of established sites and management and analytical services. They are caught in a bit of a trap because $600 would seem a lot of money to spend on a site for someone with a casual interest yet it's far too little for someone that is very serious about researching a country with a view to launching a business there, and those are the people that are most willing to pay for content. </p> <p>\"I'd also say that, with the journalist in me speaking, I've looked at the site and read the articles and, while they're good, I didn't come away feeling that I'd learned a great deal new or been given an amazing insight into the future.\" </p> <p>At the root of the potential problems facing the predictive news site is the harsh reality that while it claims to have forward-thinking journalists with insights into events around the world, those same writers will undoubtedly be contributing to other titles, both online and in print. </p> <p>According to media strategist Jonathan Schmidt of Surfacemap, whose clients have included the Financial Times and the Economist, this will mean that Earlywarning will find it hard to live up to its billing. \"It's making the economics work that is going to be key,\" he says. \"They're keeping costs down by using stringers but by definition that means you can't really bill yourself as unique because those people will work for other titles. The main issue is that for people to pay to access your content you need to have more to your brand value than a snappy title. So to start up from nowhere and then want people to give you $600 right away is a big ask.\" </p> <p>However, Fenby and the Earlywarning team are still adamant that there is an online market for those that, for example, would pay to read an article they published last week showing the different outcomes for American foreign policy should John Kerry or George Bush win the US election.</p>",
  "<p>Evidence of prisoner abuse and possible war crimes at Guant\u00e1namo Bay reached the highest levels of the Bush administration as early as autumn 2002, but Donald Rumsfeld, the defence secretary, chose to do nothing about it, according to a new investigation published exclusively in the Guardian today. </p> <p>The investigation, by the veteran journalist Seymour Hersh, quotes one former marine at the camp recalling sessions in which guards would \"fuck with [detainees] as much as we could\" by inflicting pain on them. </p> <p>The Bush administration repeatedly assured critics that inmates were granted recreation periods, but one Pentagon adviser told Hersh how, for some prisoners, they consisted of being left in straitjackets in intense sunlight with hoods over their heads. </p> <p>Hersh provides details of how President George Bush signed off on the establishment of a secret unit that was given advance approval to kill or capture and interrogate \"high-value\" suspects - considered by many to be in defiance of international law - an officially \"unacknowledged\" programme that was eventually transferred wholesale from Guant\u00e1namo to the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. </p> <p>Hersh, who broke the story of the My Lai massacre in the Vietnam war, makes his revelations in a new book, Chain of Command, which leaves senior figures in the Bush administration far more seriously implicated in the torture scandal than had been previously apparent. </p> <p>A CIA analyst visited Guant\u00e1namo in summer 2002 and returned \"convinced that we were committing war crimes\" and that \"more than half the people there didn't belong there. He found people lying in their own faeces,\" a CIA source told Hersh. </p> <p>The analyst submitted a report to General John Gordon, an aide to Condoleezza Rice, Mr Bush's national security adviser. </p> <p>Gen Gordon was troubled, and, one former administration official told Hersh \"that if the actions at Guant\u00e1namo ever became public, it'd be damaging to the president\". </p> <p>Ms Rice saw the document by autumn of the same year, and called a high-level meeting at which she asked Mr Rumsfeld, to deal with the problem. </p> <p>But after he vowed to act, \"the Pentagon went into a full-court stall\", a former White House official is quoted as saying. \"Why didn't Condi do more? She made the same mistake I made. She got the secretary of defence to say he's going to take care of it.\" </p> <p>The investigation further suggests that CIA and FBI staff had already witnessed incidents at Guant\u00e1namo just as extreme as those that would subsequently be alleged by freed inmates. </p> <p>A senior intelligence official told Hersh: \"I was told [by FBI agents] that the military guards were slapping prisoners, stripping them, pouring cold water over them and making them stand until they got hypothermia.\" </p> <p>The secret \"special access programme\" facilitating much of the mistreatment of prisoners, widely held to have contravened the Geneva convention, was established following a direct order from the president. </p> <p>Hersh reports that a secret document signed by Mr Bush in February 2002 stated: \"I determine that none of the provisions of Geneva apply to our conflict with al-Qaida in Afghanistan or elsewhere throughout the world.\" </p> <p>Hersh's book reports that an army officer communicated concerns over abuses at Abu Ghraib both to General John Abizaid, the US central command (Centcom) chief at the time, and his deputy, General Lance Smith. </p> <p>The officer told Hersh: \"I said there are systematic abuses going on in the prisons. Abizaid didn't say a thing. He looked at me - beyond me, as if to say, 'Move on. I don't want to touch this.'\" Centcom has disputed the allegation. </p> <p>In an interview with the Guardian, Hersh provided evidence that the administration sought to evade the issue: he said codenames of some programmes were changed within hours of his original story appearing, presumably to maintain their secrecy. </p> <p>In a statement, the Pentagon said Hersh's investigation \"apparently contains many of the numerous unsubstantiated allegations and inaccuracies which he has made in the past based upon unnamed sources ... Thus far ... investigations have determined that no responsible official of the Department of Defence approved any programme that could conceivably have authorised or condoned the abuses seen at Abu Ghraib. If any of Mr Hersh's anonymous sources wish to come forward and offer evidence to the contrary, the department welcomes them to do so.\" </p> <p>Pressure has been building on the Pentagon over its detention policies after it emerged at a Congressional hearing last week that the administration is being accused of concealing up to 100 \"ghost detainees\" from the Red Cross, which must be granted access to prisoners of war and other detainees under the Geneva convention. </p> <p>Mr Rumsfeld told reporters on Friday he had approved the use of harsh interrogation measures, but that they had only been meant for Guant\u00e1namo. He said the measures ought to be contrasted with those of terrorists. \"Does it rank up there with chopping someone's head off on television?\" he asked. \"It doesn't.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong> Washington Post </strong> Editorial, September 12 <br> \"The moral order we inhabit fell into focus on Thursday, and it was an awful moment. In an act without precedent since the UN genocide convention was adopted in 1948, a government accused a sitting counterpart of genocide - a genocide, moreover, that even now is continuing. And yet the accused government may not pay a price for committing this worst of all humanitarian crimes, because there is a limit to how much powerful nations care. </p> <p>\"The secretary of state, Colin Powell, who levelled the accusation of genocide against Sudan's government, is to be commended for his honesty ... And yet, having spoken the truth about Sudan's barbarity, Mr Powell offered little hope of ending it... The Bush administration should set its sights higher. As Mr Powell told the Senate on Thursday, the goal must be to get a large, neutral civilian-protection force into Darfur, so that the continuing murders and rapes can at last be ended. This will not happen unless Sudan's government invites the force in; but the invitation must be squeezed out of the regime by means of UN sanctions.\" </p> <p><strong> Newsday </strong> Editorial, New York, September 10<br> </p> <p> \"It's the first time that any government has formally called the extermination of tens of thousands of refugees in Darfur what it is: a systematic campaign to dispossess, drive out and kill an entire ethnic population by another ethnic group through the use of superior force. If that's not genocide, then that word has no meaning... </p> <p>\"More than 500 people in Darfur are dying each day. An estimated 50,000 have been killed and 1.4 million more have been uprooted from their villages. Their rescue cannot wait for lengthy deliberations over what could legally be construed as geno cide. Like pornography, genocide is not hard to define. You know it when you see it. Now something must be done about it. Quickly.\" </p> <p><strong> Philadelphia Inquirer</strong> Editorial, September 11<br> </p> <p> \"Mr Powell's declaration, plus a new US resolution offered to the UN security council, puts Sudanese President Omar Hassan Ahmad al-Bashir on notice that sanctions will fall swiftly and more squarely on government leaders should they fail to stop the militias. Sudan has already denounced the US conclusion, calling it election-year posturing. That comment is a dodge by the guilty. Mr Powell's testimony also set a boundary - finally - on how long the US will look the other way when one of its anti-terrorism partners commits atrocities at home... </p> <p>\"From early in the Bush administration, the US has led attempts to stop fighting in Sudan. The bold decision to call what's happening in Darfur a genocide keeps this country where it needs to be - at the forefront of attention on a humanitarian catastrophe.\" </p> <p><strong> Boston Globe </strong> Editorial, September 12<br> </p> <p> \"[Mr Powell] did not say the US would be asking the security council to agree that a genocide has been taking place in Darfur and to accept the obligation to stop it that is implicit in the genocide convention. His failure to follow such a path, which may be explained as diplomatic pragmatism, is nevertheless morally indefensible. </p> <p>\"If Sudan's oil buyers and weapons peddlers - China, Pakistan and Russia - can keep the security council from acting to save a million lives in Darfur, there is something radically wrong with the UN... The administration ought to ask security council members to recognise that the atrocities in Darfur constitute the crime of genocide they are obliged to prevent and punish.\"</p>",
  "Riots erupted yesterday in the western Afghan capital, Herat, killing at least seven people, after the interim president, Hamid Karzai, moved to wrest the city from its warlord ruler. <p>Afghan soldiers opened fire on a stone-throwing mob that stormed UN offices in protest at Ismail Khan's dismissal as the city's governor, destroying vehicles and burning offices. </p> <p>US helicopters hovered over the city, which was under curfew last night, as plumes of smoke rose from the burning UN buildings. The announcement followed an appeal by Mr Khan for restraint. A hospital doctor said seven people died, while the interior ministry confirmed that there were 12 injuries. </p> <p>Some protesters said they were shot at by US troops supporting the newly trained Afghan national army. </p> <p>The violence was ignited by a bold gambit by Mr Karzai, a month before the October 9 presidential election. On Saturday he dismissed Mr Khan as governor of Herat by announcing his \"promotion\" to minister of mines - an offer the warlord spurned, saying that he preferred to remain a \"private citizen\". </p> <p>The atmosphere in the city heated rapidly. Two American soldiers had to be rescued from a stone-throwing mob. </p> <p>The manoeuvring is part of a long-running tussle between Mr Khan, a legendary mujahideen leader, and the central government in Kabul. </p> <p>The warlord has frustrated several attempts to woo him from his personal fiefdom to a ministerial position in Kabul. He prefers to remain in Herat, where he controls a considerable personal army as well as the multimillion-pound border trade with Iran. </p> <p>However, a number of defeats this year appear to signal his growing military weakness. His son, the civil aviation minister, Mirwais Sadi, died in a clash with government troops in April, and last month forces loyal to his bitter rival, Amanullah Khan, fought to within 20 miles of Herat. </p> <p>The governor was embarrassed into accepting the intervention of Afghan army and US troops to save the city - a force now being used to enforce the political coup against him. </p> <p>Yesterday US helicopters hovered over Herat, days after Mr Karzai vowed to rein in renegade warlords as part of his manifesto for the presidential election. </p> <p>About 10 UN staff scrambled into a bunker on their compound and were later evacuated to a small US military base in the city. The offices of a Danish aid agency were also ransacked by the rioters. </p> <p>The US ambassador, Zalmay Khalilzad, said he had spoken to Mr Khan, urging him not to threaten security. Meanwhile, Herat's newly appointed governor, Sayed Muhammad Khairkhwa, formerly Afghan ambassador to Ukraine, flew into the city's airport. </p> <p>The UN special envoy, Jean Arnault, said Mr Khairkhwa's appointment would ensure the \"peaceful preparation of the elections\". The city was under curfew last night. </p> <p>State-run Herat TV broadcast an announcement from the army commander warning that \"any disorder will face military action\" and gatherings were forbidden, Reuters reported. </p> <p>The announcement was preceded by a statement from Mr Khan calling for restraint by protesters and the army.</p>",
  "If George Bush was running for re-election on the basis of his stewardship of the US economy alone, he would already be packing his bags. To be blunt, the economy's performance has been dismal by recent standards. Some of that grimness has not been Mr Bush's fault - he took office in the backwash of a calamitous financial bubble, the effects of which made the economic impact of 9/11 look like a hiccup. But little that the Bush team has done since has been effective or sensible in policy terms. The debate inside the White House appears to have been limited in the extreme, provoking Mr Bush's original choice as treasury secretary, Paul O'Neill, to describe the president as \"like a blind man in a roomful of deaf people\". The administration's measures have been less \"it's the economy, stupid\", and more \"the stupid economy\". <p>Even if we excuse Mr Bush the after-shocks of the dotcom meltdown and the disruption of 9/11, his record remains poor. His default mode of economic stimulus has been tax cuts for the wealthy, which Republican apologists shrilly declared to be engines of job creation. That has proved to be incorrect. Only a few months ago - February, in fact - the White House was predicting job growth of more than 300,000 a month. The reality has been less than half that, or 1.7m fewer jobs than the administration forecast just seven months ago. That means the labour market is standing still, with job creation barely keeping pace with US population growth. </p> <p>So, if no job growth, the legacy of the Bush tax cuts has instead been a ballooning deficit thanks to the tax cuts. The projections are staggering, and makes talk of Gordon Brown facing a fiscal \"black hole\" seem absurd. The Congressional Budget Office forecasts a $2,000bn deficit between now and 2009, including a $400bn shortfall this year. Given that Mr Bush came into office with a budget surplus, the figures are extraordinary: America's economy has been mortgaged for its wealthiest citizens. </p> <p>Mr Bush addressed little of this during the Republican convention, instead mentioning vague and nebulous plans to encourage \"ownership\". As the Los Angeles Times observed, his speech \"would have been more convincing if he had not actually been president for the last four years\". His opponent, John Kerry, has not been much more forthcoming, but is at least concerned about the dangers of the deficit. Many of Mr Kerry's economic advisors cut their teeth in the Clinton administration, and offer the prospect of competence and wisdom - something sorely missed in Mr Bush's White House.</p>",
  "The United States and Britain were last night trying to discover the cause of a huge mushroom cloud spotted over North Korea. <p>US officials played down fears that it might have come from a nuclear test. However, the White House was reported to have received an intelligence briefing that Pyongyang could be preparing to carry out a test. Such a move would throw the region and US foreign policy into crisis at the climax of the election campaign. </p> <p>Bush administration officials have still to establish whether the 2.5-mile-wide cloud, seen in satellite pictures four days ago, was the result of an explosion or natural disaster. </p> <p>\"There are all kinds of reports and there are all kinds of assessments that are going on,\" Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, told CNN yesterday. \"Maybe it was a forest fire of some kind. But we don't believe at this point that it was a nuclear event.\" </p> <p>However, according to the South Korean media, the cloud was caused by a blast that rocked an area in the north-eastern county Kimhyungjik, near the Chinese border, last Thursday, the 56th anniversary of communist North Korea's foundation. </p> <p>It appeared to be much more powerful than the accidental explosion at Ryongchon railway station in April, which killed at least 170 people. A spokesman in the South Korean presidential office was quoted as saying: \"We are trying to find out in detail the exact character, cause and size of the accident, but we don't think North Korea conducted a nuclear test.\" </p> <p>Nuclear experts said such a test would have been very easy to detect, adding that it was unlikely North Korea would have let off an above-ground atomic blast so close to China. </p> <p>Several other explanations have been offered, including a failed test of a conventional missile. It happened in a highland area known to house ballistic missile launch sites. </p> <p>But last night Colin Powell, the US secretary of state, said: \"There was no indication that it was a nuclear event of any kind. Exactly what it was, we're not sure.\" </p> <p>News of the explosion came as Bill Rammell, a junior Foreign Office minister, arrived in North Korea to discuss its nuclear weapons programme. He demanded an \"immediate explanation\" for the blast and will raise the issue at a meeting with Pyongyang's foreign minister today. </p> <p>North Korea said at the weekend that last week's admission by the South that it had secretly produced small quantities of uranium and plutonium had made it even more determined to continue its own nuclear arms programme. </p> <p>The news of the mushroom cloud coincided with a report in the New York Times yesterday that President George Bush had received recent intelligence reports indicating unusual activity around suspected North Korean test sites. </p> <p>Some observers interpreted the activity as a prelude to a nuclear test. </p> <p>The newspaper quoted an unnamed US administration official as saying the likelihood of a test had risen significantly in the past month. </p> <p>Responding to the reports, Ms Rice said: \"We're certainly watching certain indicators to see whether it looks like a routine activity or whether something more is going on, but it would obviously not be smart for the North Koreans to test.\" </p> <p>Ms Rice added that if the North Korean leadership were \"somehow trying to gain negotiating leverage, or their own October surprise ... they would simply isolate themselves even further\". </p> <p>An \"October surprise\" is the term used in US politics for a shock event deliberately timed to have an impact on the November presidential election. </p> <p>The US, along with South Korea, China, Japan and Russia, is trying to persuade Pyongyang to give up its nuclear ambitions. North Korea has threatened to stay away from a fourth round of multiparty talks later this year. </p> <p>In October 2002, US officials alleged that the North had admitted secretly developing a uranium-based nuclear programme, in breach of a 1994 agreement to freeze nuclear-related activities. </p> <p>Pyongyang denied the charge, but last year claimed to have reprocessed 8,000 spent fuel rods for plutonium-based weapons.</p>",
