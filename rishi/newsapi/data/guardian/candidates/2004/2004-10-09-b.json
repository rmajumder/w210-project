  "<p>Some thins are just so obvious: a British election campaign would be energised and democratised by a series of television debates. As politicians and broadcasters mither on about the disaffection of voters, this is the great opportunity to connect political issues with a mass audience - to bring the choices facing the nation right into the electorate's homes. </p> <p>The American example should convince the sceptics. The standard argument against debates is that they are Roman circuses: gaudy, crowd-pleasing events that are all about show. The purists cluck about the superficiality of television, and claim it ends up being a contest determined by make-up artists and spin doctors. Baloney.</p> <p>The debates between Bush and Kerry and Cheney and Edwards have been incredibly illuminating about the men and their policies. The chairing of the debates has been classy, while the locations have added to the sense of occasion. Do we really think we couldn't manage that in the mother of democracies? </p> <p>It's true that debates put candidates in a spotlight and under pressure. But if they can't handle answering questions in front of millions of people, it's unlikely they're going to be much good in an international crisis. </p> <p>It would be daft to pretend that television doesn't have some artificialities, but there's little evidence that it distorts. The Bush cutaway shots in the first debate were damaging because commentators believed it was a glimpse of the real man. And few would argue that Nixon had a nobler character than Kennedy, however much he was let down by his sweat glands. </p> <p>So we should have debates in Britain. They should be lengthy, testing and rigorous; and the American format would work with only a few modifications. The most obvious is that Britain is a multi-party democracy, so broadcasters would have to make sure they were being fair in their allocation of airtime - but I've no doubt this is achievable without the Prime Minister having to face the Monster Raving Loony Party. The key debates should be a co-operative venture between the main broadcasters: demo cracy is more important than channel rivalry. </p> <p>The only block, of course, is the politicians themselves. It's understandable: no favourite ever wants to share airtime with someone seen as an also-ran. The prize for our civic life, though, is enormous. Voters would tune in by the million, and they would be empowered to make their choice having seen the leaders set out their case, not in the yah-boo cauldron of Westminster, but via the medium that still dominates our age. </p> <p>Politicians can snipe about television's alleged triviality, but here is a platform they can use for the ultimate public service. Our offer is there; we're waiting for their call.</p>",
  "<p>There are those who lift your spirits, and those who keep you on your toes. Professor John Kenneth Galbraith has lifted the spirits of several generations of politicians, officials, economists, students and general readers around the world. He has also kept them on their toes. </p> <p>Galbraith is due to celebrate his 96th birthday this coming Friday. When I had lunch with him and his wife of 67 years, Catherine, in their house just outside the Harvard campus last week, it was a perfect day, autumn was beginning and the great man was in fighting form, despite still being in a wheelchair after a recent illness. He was also struggling with various deaf-aids, but the spirit was, as always, indomitable. </p> <p>I was carrying a copy of his latest book The Economics of Innocent Fraud , in which he attacks politicians and the media for colluding 'in the myths of a benign \"market\" that big business always knows best, that minimal intervention stimulates the economy, that obscene pay gaps and unrestrained self-enrichment are an inevitable by-product of the system'. </p> <p>It is, as he remarked, his 'smallest book, but has taken the longest amount of time'. He had been working on it when we last met two years ago, but he rewrote in between stays in hospital, after the fall-out from the Enron crisis proved a dramatic illustration of his thesis that there is nothing that unfettered chief executives will not do to feather their own nests. </p> <p>Before signing my copy, Galbraith drew my attention to the illustration on the cover. 'This is the roughest thing I've ever had on a book of mine - an executive briefcase scattering bombs!' In a world where US foreign policy in Iraq has been dictated by Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld and others with strong corporate links, Galbraith, who has campaigned about the power of large corporations since The Affluent Society (1958) and The New Industrial State (1967), is, as it were, sticking to his guns. </p> <p>My own association with Galbraith is a long one. The Affluent Society contained a powerful Keynesian attack on the classical economists who held that unemployment was something about which governments could do little. Galbraith, following Keynes, writes like a dream, and reading The Affluent Society was one of the factors that led a number of my generation to study economics. It is not for nothing that another great influence, the Nobel prize-winning Amartya Sen, describes Galbraith as 'the most widely read economist in the world'.</p> <p>Alas, later in our conversation, Galbraith went on to lament 'this is the only government in 30 or 40 years with no one in authority who has ever heard of John Maynard Keynes'. But we are jumping ahead. As Catherine Galbraith offered a glass of sherry, the professor boomed: 'I'm still partly crippled, but alcohol is still remedial.'</p> <p>Then, before I could ask a question, he sailed in. 'Let's start with a few problems I have. Is Blair in trouble?' I said he ought to be, but it might be wishful thinking on my part, and reminded him of Lord Hailsham's dictum that the British political system is an 'elective dictatorship'. </p> <p>Galbraith continued: 'It's a strange political calculation of his to stay for so long in support of George Bush. Why did he do that?' I said his bafflement was shared by many here. </p> <p>The wise professor, who has advised both FD Roosevelt and JF Kennedy in his time, went on to express very strong views: 'It is not a good design for relations with the US because the active voices in this country on international policy are all in conflict with Bush.' What the 'special relationship' needed was 'a certain deeper association and alliance with someone who is responsibly critical. For whatever reason, that has not been the case in Britain'. </p> <p>In Galbraith's view the French were more in tune with reality. 'Politics must take account not only of the position of the government but also of the forces behind it, and Blair does not have the support of the articulate in the US.' </p> <p>He added: 'And that is the group which has always thought well of a certain allied relationship with Britain.' He paused. 'There was a better decision by Winston Churchill!' </p> <p>At this stage I tried to move the conversation back to The Economics of Innocent Fraud and get him to say something about Conrad Black, his fellow Canadian, with whom I recalled he had not been too enamoured on a previous occasion. But he would not be moved. </p> <p>'Why has Britain been so tolerant of George Bush and his gang?' He smiled, adding, 'I always interview the reporter.' </p> <p>I did my best to answer this. He then said that perhaps it was partly because 'a lot of things important to the US do not have the same repercussions in Britain'. </p> <p>Warming to his theme, he said: 'This is a crude government, and its crude misdirection of power in minor things has more direct impact domestically than abroad.' Such as? </p> <p>'One of the worst things - unimaginable in Britain - is the open character of legislation for the rich, particularly on taxation; and the open resistance to support for the poor.' </p> <p>But that was not all. 'When income tax reductions,' he pauses and revises 'reductions' to 'slashes', 'were put into effect they were combined with this warning: \"Let's not open the way for a softer policy for the poor and the unemployed\" - a softer policy that in Keynesian terms might have been a more im portant factor in alleviating the recession.' </p> <p>Many people enter their 'anecdotage' at ages much younger than Galbraith's. Although he was happy to reminisce, he kept returning to the gravity of the present US and world scene. </p> <p>'We are seeing the disintegration of the American economic and wider world role, which could well continue after this election. I am talking about the passage of power to the Rumsfelds of the economic and political structure.' </p> <p>In his new book, Galbraith points out that in the fiscal year 2003 'close to half the total of US government discretionary expenditure [outlay not mandated for particular use, such as social security or service of the public debt] was used for military purposes - for defence, as more favourably it is called'. </p> <p>In one sense, as he acknowledges, little has changed since President Eisenhower warned in the 1950s of a 'military industrial complex'. As Galbraith says, 'a large, vital and expanding part of what is called the public sector is for all practical effect in the private sector... much [arms expenditure] is at the initiative and with the authority of the arms industry and its political voice - the private sector. </p> <p>Galbraith gave a dire warning of what would happen if Bush was re-elected. 'Under the thrust of power of present forces, including the money-making powers, there's going to be a continuing and disastrous [American] decline. The Rumsfelds and the Cheneys will still be there, and anyone with a grasp of world history should be here to report it.' He smiled and said: 'Why don't you do that?' </p> <p>The great man feels passionately. 'In all my 90-odd years, I've never had such a clear view of the future,' adding with a twinkle in his eye, 'with still, of course, the possibility of being wrong.' But only the possibility. 'I have a feeling that not since the end of World War Two have we had such a time when the role of wisdom, action and misunderstanding in the US has such worldwide consequences.' </p> <p>He says he is now working on a new book. With that he was assisted into a chair (made in Newcastle, England) that hoisted him up the stairs, as if on a domestic funicular railway, for his afternoon nap. </p> <p>As he disappeared from sight he called out: 'There's just one more thing.' His nurse brought down a car bumper sticker, with a picture of George Bush. The slogan was: 'Some things were never meant to be recycled.'</p>",
  "<p><strong> Where are England going?</strong> </p> <p>Sven's off to the former Soviet Republic of Azerbaijan - which lies in the beautiful Caucasian region, east of Turkey and the Black Sea and west of the Caspian sea. They'll be playing at the Tofig Bakhramov stadium in the capital, Baku.</p> <p><strong>Tofig, wasn't that...?</strong></p> <p>Yes, the 'Russian' linesman who judged Geoff Hurst's cracker against West Germany to be over the line in the 1966 World Cup final.</p> <p><strong>That has to be a good omen... The Azeri national team will be a walkover, surely?</strong> </p> <p>England have never played them - Wales won in Baku in 2002 but could only get a draw there last month. Football hasn't run too smoothly since the country's independence in 1992. Last year Fifa suspended the Azeri football federation and the national team for 'the severe and unacceptable levels of extreme [government] pressure in recent times'. And, a year before that, their domestic league was shut down for six months because of alleged match-rigging.</p> <p><strong>Who would want to be coach of this lot?</strong></p> <p>Carlos Alberto Torres, the Brazil captain and right-back who scored one of the most memorable goals ever, against Italy, on the way to winning the 1970 World Cup.</p> <p><strong>Surely some mistake? Is he lost?</strong></p> <p>Why he took the job isn't entirely clear, but Torres says he's doing it for the love of the game. 'Sometimes money is secondary in one's life, while human relations and a will to work for the good of the game is primary.'</p> <p><strong>Human relations? In Azerbaijan?</strong></p> <p>Presumably Torres still hasn't seen the report published earlier this year by campaign group Human Rights Watch. It said that torturing members of the opposition was common and that more than 100 opposition leaders were facing jail terms of up to 12 years. Criticising president Ilham Aliyev is not a good idea.</p> <p><strong>Exactly how dodgy is his regime?</strong></p> <p>Azerbaijan recently finished sixth in a survey of the most corrupt countries in the world - and Aliyev has appointed many of his closest allies as heads of the country's different sporting organisations.</p> <p><strong>But surely - despite it all - everyone's pretty happy in a country that has so much oil, and therefore so much money?</strong></p> <p>Funnily enough, the money from the oil doesn't seem to reach the people of Azerbaijan. Aliyev's brother owns most of the petrol stations there, while observers claim the last election was rigged.</p> <p><strong>So presumably the West has responded to this corrupt regime with unqualified outrage?</strong> </p> <p>Not exactly. Aliyev was recently photographed with a smiling George W Bush - who doesn't object to rigged elections - and Tony Blair at a recent Nato summit. Bush has cemented his friendship with Aliyev by generously increasing America's presence in Azerbaijan, to help in the 'war on terror'.</p> <p><strong>He's too kind. Nothing to do with the with \u00a32billion oil pipeline being built from Baku to Ceyhan in Turkey, then? A pipeline that will reduce the west's reliance on oil from the Middle East?</strong></p> <p>Not at all. The pipeline, due to pump a million barrels per day of Caspian crude to the Mediterranean coast from April next year, has nothing to do with the US's presence in Azerbaijan, which will be 'temporary', according to US politicians.</p> <p><strong>So what can England expect on the pitch?</strong></p> <p>A hard-fighting 3-5-2 unit with a bit of samba flair. Perennial Azeri player of the year Gurban Gurbanov, 32, is their biggest threat up front, scoring 14 goals in 59 games. The players play their domestic football in Russia, Azerbaijan and Turkey.</p> <p><strong>Any reasons to fear a shock home win?</strong> </p> <p>Yes. They have, admittedly, finished last in every qualifying group they have participated in bar one - when they were up against Liechtenstein - but have beaten Switzerland, Slovakia and Serbia at home while drawing with Portugal and Wales, also in Baku, in qualifying games. This isn't a trip to look forward to.</p> <p>You can mail the Observer direct at <a href=\"mailto:sport@observer.co.uk\">sport@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "<p>Here is the situation. You are an executive at a large FTSE 100 company. You and your corporate broker are in heavy discussions with the Financial Services Authority, the most powerful regulator ever seen in the City, about whether your company needs to make a profits warning. </p> <p>The timing could not be more delicate. A major strategic presentation is a fortnight away. Do you: </p> <p>a) keep your head down, and at all costs avoid talking to outsiders about anything that could be remotely interpreted as price sensitive? </p> <p>or (b) ring up a City analyst and tell him he should have cut a newly published profit forecast by more than 10%? If your answer, as they say, is mostly (b), you work for Sainsbury's. </p> <p>The phrase crass stupidity does not quite do justice to the decision by an anonymous company official to ring Merrill Lynch's analysts to discuss why their gloomy profits forecast should have been even more gloomy. </p> <p>Precisely what was said, and whether it breached the listing rule will be a matter for the FSA investigation. But we shouldn't expect the verdict to take very long because the entire evidence consists of one short telephone call that Merrill has presumably taped. </p> <p>While Sainsbury's mutters about this being \"a private conversation\", the two analysts are absolutely candid about why they cut their profit forecast for the second time in five days. The key passage from their research note reads: \"Quite simply, the company has helpfully pointed out we were high in our suggested \u00a3177m PBT [profit before tax outcome for H1 [first half] - quite a bit too high. We understand that \u00a3125m is more like the number they have in mind.\" </p> <p>The analysts describe it as a \"helpful\" call and it is hard to disagree: they are paid big salaries to make accurate forecasts of companies' profits. They must have thought Christmas had come early. </p> <p>As for Sainsbury's, it's time to wonder whether its decline is tragedy or farce. </p> <p><strong> Open goal </strong><br> </p> <p>John Kerry has a reputation for being a good finisher. Judging by yesterday's jobs data coming out of Washington, however, he doesn't need to be. He is faced with the political equivalent of an open goal. </p> <p>Republican spin doctors will no doubt see it differently, but the one salient fact to come out of yesterday's numbers was this: you have to go back 72 years to find the last president to preside over a net loss of jobs during a term at the White House. His name, of course, was Herbert Hoover and after his disastrous presidency the Republicans didn't win again until 1952. </p> <p>Before the Democrats get too excited, it is as well to note that the historical parallels are not that precise. Bush's record is nowhere near as poor as Hoover's, and he is further helped by the fact that the economy was still deteriorating in 1932, while the job losses in the last four years were concentrated in the early part of Bush's term. He will no doubt say the recession was already in the pipeline when he took office, and was further exacerbated by the totally unforeseen events of September 11. </p> <p>Nor, let's face is, is Kerry a mark two Roosevelt. If he loses on November 2, he may bitterly regret banging on about his Vietnam record rather than concentrating on the economy. If Kerry has a New Deal up his sleeve or even a soundbite as punchy as \"we have nothing to fear except fear itself\", he is keeping mightily schtum about it. </p> <p>The fact remains, however, that the US recovery is faltering, despite a massive monetary and fiscal stimulus. Consumers are heavily indebted, Bush took a 2% budget surplus bequeathed by Bill Clinton and has - through a combination of tax cuts for the rich and higher defence spending - turned it into a 4% deficit. America's trade deficit is heading for $600bn this year. On top of all that, jobs have been lost. If Kerry can't win with all that in his favour, he doesn't deserve to. </p> <p><strong> Jessops' signpost </strong><br> </p> <p>The planned flotation of Jessops, the photographic goods retailer, is likely to attract more attention than might normally attach to a company whose likely market capitalisation is being pencilled in by the City at around \u00a3180m. </p> <p>For the last three years or so most merger and acquisition activity has centred on venture capital groups, as corporates have sought to woo investors' good opinion by being \"focused\" and the funds have scented bargains. </p> <p>Now many of the funds will be looking at realising some of the investments they have built up in the years since stock market sentiment soured with the collapse of the dotcom boom. </p> <p>The snag is that though sentiment might not now be described as sour, it is still uncertain. A number of possible floats have failed to get off the ground, others have gone ahead but at prices which may have disappointed owners. </p> <p>Last month the UK IPO market got a boost when car insurer Admiral made a successful debut. The amount of stock Jessops is able to sell and the price it can command will be useful signposts for venture capital funds looking to test the strength or otherwise of investor appetite.</p>",
  "<p>If you want to know Ireland, the real Ireland, Catholic Ireland, the Ireland of the Gaels, go west. On the rocky, mountainous rim of the Atlantic the island shrugs up its boggy shoulders and thumbs its nose at Viking invaders, Cromwellian armies, the prissy Anglo influence of the Pale, and anyone else who would seek to displace a culture steeped in Celtic tradition. </p> <p>The westernmost of Ireland's peaks is cloud-capped Mount Brandon, its black hump rising from rocky fields and grey water near the end of the Dingle peninsula. At 891m, it is not the highest mountain in Ireland; that distinction - by a few feet - belongs to Carrantuohill across Dingle Bay. But Carrantuohill is jut one of a cluster of peaks; Brandon lords it alone in solitary grandeur over a thumb of land jutting into the sea. </p> <p>For centuries, Mount Brandon has been one of Ireland's \"holy mountains\", and annually on the appointed summer day pious pilgrims trek to the top. The mountain has another attractive feature for the secular hillwalker; it is close by Dingle town, one of Ireland's most charming - and welcoming - destinations. </p> <p>Some say that Mount Brandon takes its name from Bran, the mythical Celtic voyager to the Island of Women in the Western Sea; more likely, the name recalls the more firmly historical Saint Brendan. Known as the Navigator, he was born not far away near the present city of Tralee in the year 484 (or thereabouts) and was said to have sailed in a oxskin boat from a cove at the base of the mountain on a seven-year voyage in search of the Isles of the Blest. If the story were true, he would have been the first person to discover America, but there is no reliable evidence that the voyage took place at all. </p> <p>Brendan was one of many highly educated monks of the dark ages who made their home on the rugged west coast of Ireland, facing out into the rain-lashed, fog-shrouded Western Sea. Somewhere beyond those grey mists lay the Isles of the Blest, or so they believed, a place of rest and happiness. Their vision was horizontal, not vertical; their God resided not in an ethereal heaven above but in wind, sea, stone and air. </p> <p>Was it a literal paradise they sought in the apparently boundless waters of the Atlantic? Certainly in those ocean vistas they sensed the majesty of God. They built huts and oratories of unmortared stone in the westernmost reaches of Europe, and focused their attention on the sea horizon. On the summit of Mount Brandon you can still find remnants of stone structures said to be associated with Saint Brendan. </p> <p>Except for a few recent plantations of evergreens at low altitudes, the slopes and summit of the mountain are bare. Experienced hillwalkers are pretty much free to ramble wherever they please. </p> <p>The most popular route up the mount begins at the Virgin's shrine at Faha on the mountain's eastern slope, near the pretty villages of Cloghane and Brandon. Since I first took this route 30 years ago, the Kerry county council has provided a car park for half a dozen cars; on a fine summer day, many more may be jammed into the verges by the side of the road. </p> <p>A sign posted by the Kerry Mountaineering Club warns that weather conditions on the summit can be wildly different from those at the mountain's base. \"A breeze here can be a strong wind at the top,\" it says with some understatement. </p> <p>Up a short fuchsia-shaded boreen (little road), through a gate that hangs lopsidedly on its hinges, and trekkers are on their way up the hill in the footsteps of Celtic heroes and Christian saints. A first stop is often at the Marian shrine tucked into the hillside. The Virgin looks down from her central niche; while to her left is Brendan, boyishly handsome on the bow of his boat. </p> <p>The first part of the climb is something of a slog, steadily upwards through rough fields - but stop for a minute, turn around, and a dazzling prospect awaits you: the golden sands of Brandon Bay and the green hills beyond, stretching back along the peninsula towards Tralee. </p> <p>At the shoulder of the ridge, the path turns toward the ice-sculpted valley of the Owenmore river, but the adventurous hiker will keep moving straight up the mountain to Binn na Port, the Peak of the Fort, a place as remote as any on the Dingle peninsula - gloomy, cloud-wrapped, timeless. </p> <p>Here, on a jutting promontory of the mountain, two massive stone walls guard a plateau protected on other sides by steep cliffs - an iron-age fortification 822m above the sea. </p> <p>The sanctuary of Binn na Port suggests a people huddled in a cold, wet place, with minimum shelter, awaiting the onslaught of their enemies. Defeat meant slavery or death. We tend to romanticise pre-Christian Celtic culture; the archeological evidence, however, suggests a grim and violent time. </p> <p>However, it is clear that the pre-Christian Celts revered the natural world. A friend, a Celtic expert, suggests that a more correct translation of \"Binn na Port\" is \"Peak of the Music\", and indeed the wind here does play a kind of unceasing music on the rock and cliff. </p> <p>From Binn na Port, there is no way to continue our assault on the summit other than to descend again to the pilgrim path, which now enters a dark, steep-sided valley with no apparent egress from the far end. In the 19th century, John Ball, an Alpine mountaineer, visited these valleys on the flanks of Brandon and noticed similarities to valleys in Switzerland where living glaciers reside today. This is the place where the reality of the Ice Ages in northern Europe was first recognised. </p> <p>The evidence of ice is all about us as we traverse the valley: in scoured and scratched bedrock; in massive boulders carried far from their source; in ridges of rocky debris, called moraines, piled up at the former edge of the ice. Best of all, the glacier has laid open the mountain like the incision of a surgeon's knife. Great loops of layered rock in the valley's walls tell a geological story more ancient than the ice, of colliding continents, of millions of years of sedimentation, of mountains thrust upwards and eroded down. </p> <p>Now, just when you might think there is no way of going further, a track appears that zigzags almost straight up to the summit. The track is rough and steep, but at the top, if the weather is fine, you will be knocked over backwards by a view as spectacular as any you might find in Ireland - the end of the Dingle peninsula in all of its wild grandeur, with an ellipsis of islands reaching out into the sea. </p> <p>You have climbed through hundreds of millions of years of geologic history, thousands of years of myth, and hundreds of years of Irish history. You deserve a reward. So it's back down the pilgrim path for a well-earned pint at one of the friendly pubs at the mountain's base. My favourite is O'Connors in Cloghane, where you will likely find other stout-booted trekkers with whom to exchange stories of your climb. </p> <p>And then, if you are wise, you will have left enough time on your itinerary to drive the precipitous Connor Pass road to Dingle, with its many fine bars and restaurants (try Lord Baker's, The Charthouse, or The Stonehouse on the Slea Head road). The region abounds in antiquities: promontory forts, ring forts, the famous \"beehive huts\" on the slopes of Mount Eagle, medieval castles, and - unmissable - the magical Gallarus Oratory. </p> <p>This tiny chapel, shaped like an overturned boat, is perhaps the oldest intact building in these islands. It may have been built a bit after Saint Brendan's time, but the spirit of saints and scholars is all about the place, and if, on your climb up Brandon, you caught a whiff of Celtic spirituality, you will find it present here. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Chet Raymo's Climbing Brandon: Science And Faith On Ireland's Holy Mountain is published in the US by Walker &amp; Company, available at <a href=\"http://www.guardianbookshop.co.uk/berteshopweb/viewproduct.do?isbn=0863223311\">The Guardian bookshop</a> for \u00a312.99 plus p&amp;p.

  "The ballot or the bullet - that's the choice. This simple maxim has become one of the favourite soundbites of our nation-building times. It is being trotted out again as Afghans prepare to vote in presidential elections today, and is already much in use in official circles as the countdown starts for polls in Iraq. <p>On the one side are the insurgents, terrorists, men of violence, or whatever the current label is, who fear democracy and will do all they can to stop it. On the other is a people who have never had a chance to choose their leaders and want nothing more than to exercise it at last. </p> <p>The contrast is comforting, but rarely conforms to reality in any but the remotest way. Elections can be manipulated and misused. They are only one part of a long process of enabling people to speak, organise and hold their rulers to account. </p> <p>If they take place too early, they can be counterproductive and delay a society's transition to a culture of genuine debate and competition. That was the lesson of the Balkans in the 1990s, in particular in Bosnia, where the rush to vote (pressed mainly by the Clinton administration) entrenched hardline nationalists in power. Last week's local elections in Bosnia confirmed how hard it is to loosen the grip they acquired then. </p> <p>In Afghanistan and Iraq, the issue is whether elections that are meant to offer an alternative to violence are actually promoting it. That certainly seems to be the case in Afghanistan. With its requirement to have polling stations and registrars around the country, the election process becomes the softest of targets. </p> <p>In recent weeks, attacks by a resurgent Taliban have increased. The United Nations has urged staff not involved in running the elections to go on leave. Aid agencies are imposing curfews and telling staff to restrict their movements or go abroad. </p> <p>Some aid workers query the huge amount of money allocated for what they say is mainly a propaganda exercise, and say it would have been better spent on education and health. They point to the fact that high insecurity has deterred independent monitors, thereby raising the risk of fraud. </p> <p>It is not just anti-government forces who are behind the violence. Local and regional warlords may not be rocketing polling stations or ambushing registrars, but they are making threats to opposition candidates and their supporters. Women voters are particular targets. </p> <p>Several of the 18 presidential candidates are thought to have entered the race merely to strengthen their bargaining power in the closed-door meetings which have already got underway among Afghanistan's strongmen to discuss ministerial portfolios and the post-polling pace of reform. What was meant as an expression of democracy becomes a device to resist, rather than promote, change. </p> <p>In Iraq, the black and white image of a government that wants elections, and insurgents who are ready to use violence to stop it, is even less accurate. The greatest risk of pre-election violence in today's Iraq comes from the United States, not from the various groups of insurgents. </p> <p>In the name of recapturing Iraqi cities so that polling can take place, US forces have already started - and are planning to widen - a campaign of air strikes which will probably cause more civilian casualties than last year's invasion. </p> <p>Iraq's health ministry recently compiled a chilling set of statistics, which were obtained and exclusively published by the American news organisation, Knight-Ridder. The ministry took reports from hospitals in 15 of Iraq's 18 provinces. It did not have data from the three Kurdish provinces where political violence is minimal. </p> <p>The death tolls may include some Iraqi police and national guardsmen, but mainly count civilians. They are unlikely to include insurgents, since their families usually fear taking seriously wounded resistance fighters to government hospitals. They bury their dead without registration at the morgue. </p> <p>The findings were that out of 3,487 Iraqi deaths since April 5, two-thirds were killed by US and multinational forces or Iraqi police. In other words, the footage of car-bombs and suicide attacks set off by insurgents, which TV cameras are able to film in central Baghdad and which we see on our screens, may give the false impression that anti-government forces are the biggest killers. </p> <p>In fact, a greater toll is mounting up, unfilmed, in Sadr City, Falluja, Samarra and other cities where the US uses airstrikes. According to the health ministry, two Iraqis are being killed by the government side for each one killed by insurgents. </p> <p>As for giving Iraqis a choice in the upcoming elections which will pick a constituent assembly and government, the danger that they will be disappointed is coming from backroom deals similar to the Afghan ones. A recent poll by the Iraqi Centre for Research and Strategic Studies shows that 61% believe suitable candidates will be prevented from campaigning. </p> <p>One reason for scepticism is that Prime minister Ayad Allawi, supported by Washington, is trying to put together a \"consensus list\" of himself and the formerly exiled parties in the current government, including Kurds, Shias and Sunnis. Voters would be presented with a take-it-or-leave-it offer. For Allawi, who has little chance of retaining power if his party stands alone, the combined list is the only hope. For the Kurds who want to enshrine their right to autonomy in the constitution which will be drafted next year, it also makes sense to do a pre-election deal with the largest Shia parties. </p> <p>The jokers in the pack are Grand Ayatollah Ali al Sistani, the respected Shia leader who has already criticised the concept of a government list, and Moqtada al Sadr, the radical cleric. </p> <p>If al Sadr decided to take part in the poll and create his own \"national patriotic list\", with the central demand that foreign forces leave Iraq immediately, Allawi and his allies would be in serious trouble. It is not inconceivable that al Sadr could entice the leading Sunni organisation, the Council of Islamic Scholars, and the Iraqi Islamic party to his list. The grand ayatollah might even endorse it. Given the occupation's unpopularity, this would make the \"patriotic list\" unstoppable. </p> <p>Although peace talks for Falluja and Sadr city are sputtering on, some Iraqis fear the looming US air offensive has unacknowledged aims. One is to provoke such resistance in the nationalist Sunni and al Sadr strongholds that elections can be cancelled in those areas. Another is to make it impossible for al Sadr to disband his militia and join the election without seeming to have been defeated on the battlefield. </p> <p>It is a high-stakes game in which the US is working hard to prevent a government emerging that would ask it to go home. One early result is to expose how phoney the bombs-or-ballots alternative really is. Iraqis are going to get a lot of the former, whatever happens with the latter. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:j.steele@theguardian.com\">j.steele@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>George Bush yesterday became the first US president since Herbert Hoover in the Depression to preside over a loss of jobs when the last set of employment figures published before next month's election showed only a modest improvement in September. </p> <p>On the day that President Bush was preparing for his second televised debate with his Democrat challenger, John Kerry, he was given the unwelcome news that more than 800,000 jobs had been shed in the past four years. </p> <p>The bureau of labour statistics (BLS) said that non-farm payrolls rose by 96,000 in September - weaker than the 148,000 increase predicted by the financial markets and not enough to compensate for the employment losses suffered during the recession that accompanied the beginning of Mr Bush's presidency. </p> <p>With opinion polls suggesting that Mr Bush lost the first of the three debates, analysts said the eagerly anticipated employment report would allow Mr Kerry to say that the war in Iraq had resulted in the president neglecting problems at home. </p> <p>Steven Andrew, an economist at ISIS Asset Management, said: \"The September non-farm payroll data represented the final opportunity for the labour market report to help President Bush keep his own job. Unfortunately for the president, the report played into the hands of John Kerry in confirming Bush as having presided over an economy which has cut 821,000 jobs over his tenure.\" </p> <p>Paul Ashworth of Capital Economics said the only good news for the president from yesterday's data was that the bureau of labour statistics said it would be revising upwards the level of payrolls by 236,000 in January. </p> <p>\"Unfortunately, even allowing for that upward revision, Bush is now confirmed as the first president since Hoover to have overseen a net loss of jobs during his presidential term,\" Mr Ashworth added. </p> <p>Wall Street believes that the lack of vigorous job creation from the stuttering US economy may persuade the Federal Reserve Board to postpone an expected increase in American interest rates next month. </p> <p>Analysts said the \"soft spot\" in the economy was persisting, with high oil prices helping to put the brake on growth. Crude futures remained just below $53 a barrel in New York yesterday, despite the end of a strike by oil workers in Nigeria. </p> <p>The dollar fell sharply on the foreign exchanges following the release of the jobs data in Washington. It lost more than 1% against the euro, lost ground against the Swiss franc and suffered its biggest one-day fall against the yen in more than a year, posting a \u00a51.8 drop. Sterling, which hit an eight-month low against the euro at 69.23 pence, gained three-quarters of a cent against the American currency to just over $1.79. </p> <p>The Bush camp put a brave face on the employment statistics numbers. John Snow, the US treasury secretary, said: \"Clearly we are on the right path. I am confident we will see that continue.\" </p> <p>Officials at the BLS said the four hurricanes last month could not be blamed for the weakness of job creation, saying the impact on the labour market was minor. </p> <p>The service sector saw the strongest employment gains last month, adding 109,000 positions, of which 33,000 were part-time. The manufacturing sector - important in the swing states of America's industrial heartland - shed 18,000 jobs in September.</p>",
  "The second presidential debate turned into a bare-knuckle battle for the White House last night, with George Bush and John Kerry dropping all pretence at civility as they savaged each other's records. <p>In an encounter that bristled with animosity, both candidates were on almost constant attack, setting out sharply opposing positions from Iraq to the economy, supreme court judges, abortion, and the environment.</p> <p>Last night's debate - the second of three encounters - caps a difficult week for Mr Bush, with opinion polls showing a tightening of the race for the White House after his lacklustre performance in last week's televised contest.</p> <p>On Wednesday, the CIA chief weapons inspector discredited the administration's rationale for the war on Iraq by saying that Saddam Hussein had no weapons of mass destruction. Mr Bush also suffered a setback on the domestic front yesterday with the release of disappointing new job figures.</p> <p>An AP-Ipsos opinion poll published hours before the debate put Mr Kerry slightly ahead with 50% support compared to 46% for Mr Bush, raising the stakes of the encounter.</p> <p>For Mr Bush, under deepening pressure to make up for the shaky performance and angry scowls of last week's debate, the rematch was his chance to reassure Americans that he was of presidential material. Strategists for Mr Kerry were hoping for a forceful appearance to build on the momentum of their first contest.</p> <p>Unlike their previous encounter, last night's contest was a town hall debate, with voters posing questions that had been vetted earlier in the day by a moderator. The candidates paced across a vast red carpet, making occasional attempts to bond with the spectators, but mostly focussing their fury on each other.</p> <p>For campaign operatives, the intensity of last night's engagement was designed to give voters a clear idea of the differences between the candidates. </p> <p>\"The president's view of the world is black and white and there is no grey at all,\" said Tad Devine, a senior adviser to the Kerry campaign. \"John Kerry showed that he understands these very complicated issues and could negotiate them.\"</p> <p>Dan Bartlett, the White House communications chief, said: \"There were some key moments where I think the president highlighted in a very effective way the problems in Senator Kerry's record.\"</p> <p>In practical terms, that meant that Mr Kerry used his portion of the 90-minute encounter to drive home his argument that Mr Bush - because he won't acknowledge his mistakes on Iraq - is dangerously out of touch with reality.</p> <p>Mr Bush, in turn, focused on portraying Mr Kerry as a liberal who would raise taxes, and who was naive on national security.</p> <p>But neither candidate gave ground willingly.</p> <p>The first question, to Mr Kerry, echoed a Republican charge that has followed the Democratic challenger throughout the campaign: that he is wishy-washy, and tailors his opinions to the prevailing political winds.</p> <p>Mr Kerry immediately turned the question into an attack on Mr Bush's conduct of the war on Iraq. \"The president didn't find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq so he has turned his campaign into a weapon of mass deception,\" he said.</p> <p>And so it went, with Mr Kerry and Mr Bush trading barbs on taxes, jobs, Osama bin Laden, and the deficit.</p> <p>When Mr Kerry promised he would not raise taxes on the middle classes, Mr Bush sneered: \"Of course he is going to raise your taxes.\"</p> <p>When Mr Bush unveiled his plan to trim a deficit that had ballooned under his watch, Mr Kerry replied: \"He's added more debt to the debt of the United States in four years than all the way from George Washington to Ronald Reagan put together. Go figure.\" </p> <p>After the debate, Republican and Democratic strategists both predictably proclaimed outright victory, but neither side appeared overly confident, and the outcome was not as clear as in last week's debate.</p> <p>That contest was decided by Mr Bush's angry grimaces and evident impatience, broadcast to 65 million television viewers. </p> <p>By last night's debate, the president had his temper mostly under check, but his anger was evident as he scribbled frantically in a large notepad, or jumped out of his seat to answer questions. He also interrupted the moderator to angrily denounce Mr Kerry's charge that he had failed to build a coalition for the war in Iraq.</p> <p>\"You tell Tony Blair we're going alone,\" he said. \"Tell Silvio Berlusconi we're going alone. Tell Alexander Kwasniewski of Poland we're going alone. We've got 30 countries there.\"</p> <p>Mr Bush also appeared more in control of his material - unlike the first debate when he clung relentlessly to a few poll-tested slogans - although he faltered in his answers on the environment and the appointment of supreme court judges. He also provoked muffled laughter from the audience when he mentioned the \"internets\".</p>",
  "John Kerry inched ahead of President George Bush in polls published ahead of last night's second face-to-face debate. <p>An Associated Press poll showed the Democratic party challenger taking a slender lead over the incumbent, gaining ground with women, boosting his overall popularity and cutting into the president's advantage on national security.</p> <p>A second poll conducted for Time magazine put the two rivals even but said Mr Kerry was ahead on likeability, particularly among female voters. The Time poll showed the two men at 45% each before their second debate, which was due to take place in St Louis last night, with 3% for the independent Ralph Nader.</p> <p>In the poll conducted for AP by Ipsos-Public Affairs, the Democratic ticket of Mr Kerry and John Edwards led Mr Bush and the vice-president, Dick Cheney, by 50% to 46%.</p> <p>The survey, taken from a sample of 944 likely voters from October 4 to 6, had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.</p> <p>The race was tied at 47% among the 1,273 registered voters in the poll, similar to others showing a tight race.</p> <p>Nearly three-quarters of likely voters surveyed by AP said they had watched or listened to the first Bush-Kerry debate on September 30.</p> <p>Almost 40% said they came away with a more favourable view of Mr Kerry, while only 8% felt better about Mr Bush. Nearly a third of those who watched the debate said it gave them a less favourable view of Mr Bush.</p> <p>In the final weeks of the campaign, the president is facing an unsettled electorate. Nearly 60% of all the people questioned said the country was heading in the wrong direction, reflecting a gloomy national mood that could jeopardise Mr Bush's re-election effort.</p> <p>His overall job approval rating among likely voters - at 46% - was at its lowest point since June, and down from 54% in late September.</p>",
  "<b>\u00b7</b> The past week in Bournemouth was prettily punctuated by frenetic attempts to demonstrate that those who now lead the Conservative party are human beings, just like the rest of us. Well, most of the rest of us, anyway. When did they get their first kiss? Which was their favourite liquorice allsort? (Mine, since we're all so confessional nowadays, was the one that was shaped like a log.) Which of the works of Gian Carlo Menotti would they want to take to a desert island? That kind of thing. I think I know where this is leading. The shadow international development secretary, Alan Duncan, emphasising the importance of political parties fielding those who looked good on TV, suggested that Boris Johnson was \"probably the most popular person in Conservative politics\" because he was so well known, and even urged his colleagues, the Guardian tells us, \"to undergo image overhauls\". And a YouGov poll in the Telegraph found that Johnson, a mere shadow arts minister, was better recognised than apparently more eminent figures such as Oliver Letwin and David Davis. The conclusion is inescapable. Unless there's some sensational boost to the party's fortunes within the next month or so, its principal figures are all going to have to rebrand themselves in the image of Boris Johnson. <p>A makeover artiste writes: That is easily done. The essential steps are as follows: 1) The hair. Buy an outsize mop - they're available in all good hardware stores and most bad ones - and dye it the appropriate shade of blond. It may be stiff after dyeing, so practise shaking your head about in some windy spot on a nearby heath, while chortling uncontrollably. Don't forget to remove the handle before putting your mop on your head. 2) The language. Read one of the Greyfriars stories before starting your day. But try not to say Yarooh, for fear of revealing your source. 3) Buy a bicycle, and ride it with brave impetuosity. Curse loudly if balked. If you stop alongside a senior Blair adviser at the traffic lights in Whitehall, don't let him move on until he's said something unfriendly about Gordon Brown. 4) When appearing as chairman of Have I Got News For You, mix things up and forget things, apologising sweetly the while. Stick at it until you hear somebody in the audience describing you as \"a loveable muppet\". </p> <p>A contrarian writes: Those who savour independently minded people such as myself might like to note the table setting out the responses in the same YouGov poll when they asked: \"Which four or five of the following policies would make you most likely to vote Conservative at the next election - or would you not vote Conservative whatever they promised?\" One per cent of those who classed themselves as Conservative voters said they wouldn't vote for the party whatever it said. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> I don't know what to make of the US elections. I've assumed all along that George Bush was likely to win, though there's one overwhelming indicator pointing to Kerry: the Telegraph/Spectator pundit Mark Steyn is certain that Bush will triumph. If, even in spite of that, Kerry does lose, I shall wonder whether part of the reason is that he had the wrong grandfather. His grandfather's name, it is said, was originally Cohen. Deciding to change it, he stuck a pin in the map, and it hit the word Kerry. Nothing wrong with Kerry, of course; but was not this a rash and irresponsible step for the grandfather of a possible presidential contender to take? I haven't yet discovered where grandfather Cohen was when he wielded his pin. We are told it had nothing to do with Ireland. Some say it preceded his arrival in the US, but I doubt if you'd find a Kerry on the map of Austria. The only Kerrys my spies in the US are able to trace are inconspicuous spots in Oregon and North Dakota, but these may not even have existed in the year of the pin. You can get some indication of the hazards of the procedure, though, if you look at a map of Powys, where there's a Kerry just east of Newtown. If you close your eyes and take a stab at this Kerry, you will find you may just as easily hit Abermule, Bettws Cedewain, Bwlch-y-ffridd or, most likely of all, Llanllwchaiarn. Schwarzenegger one day perhaps, but no self-respecting American would vote for a president sporting a name like these. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> My thanks to those who have written in about porchlights, mostly making the point that when the former FBI man I quoted last week talked of keeping the emotional porchlight burning during hostage negotiations, he was alluding to the practice prevalent in US homesteads of keeping the porchlight on till all are home and the family is complete. Years of investigative journalism had in fact enabled me to deduce that: what interested me was the suspicion that this might be one of those moments where a tasty new formulation begins the journey that will make it one day a much loved cliche. The porchlight is, I suppose, the equivalent of the home fire, as in the first world war song Keep the Home Fires Burning - a precaution householders were told they ought to take so long as their hearts were yearning and their lads were far way, in the knowledge that there was a silver lining which through the dark cloud was shining; a dark cloud, moreover, which ought to be turned inside out till the boys came home. The words were by Lena Ford, the music by Ivor Novello, though some believe that the words in the opening line were Novello's too. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> More next week, I hope, on Deritend, mumpokers and the right of Plato to a place in an all-time Great Greeks football XI. (He was out, he was in, he was out, and now he's back in again.) In the meantime please watch out for the word bouncebackability, as deployed by Amicus leader Derek Simpson on Sky TV after hearing Tony Blair's conference speech. This was not, says a source within Sky, as original as it might sound. Its first use, it's suggested, was in an interview, also on Sky, with Iain Dowie, manager of soaraway Crystal Palace. Evidence of even earlier usages, by Boris Johnson, Grandfather Cohen, or even Plato perhaps, will be joyfully received and may even get printed. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:MrSmallweed@aol.com\">MrSmallweed@aol.com</a></p>",
  "A giant American database, which is being used by the Tories to root out swing voters, is being hailed by Michael Howard as the party's secret \"tool\" which could transform next year's general election. <p>Senior Tories told the Guardian that the Voter Vault system, which identifies 400 social characteristics, is proving a great success in identifying voters who have abandoned the party in the past decade. </p> <p>The Tory high command believes it is on the verge of finally identifying its own \"Mondeo Man\" or \"Worcester Woman\", the sort of upwardly mobile voters who flocked to New Labour in the mid-90s. </p> <p>\"We have a new tool,\" one senior Tory said proudly. \"It is something we have borrowed from the US. The notion is that if you know what people's social characteristics are, it is not too difficult to identify how they will vote.\" </p> <p>Voter Vault, which is being used by the Bush campaign, looks at people's shopping, eating and lifestyle habits. This is based on the Mosaic system which is used by supermarkets to work out which products to target at shoppers. </p> <p>The new system \"vaults\" this commercial information to predict how people will vote. That in turn allows party workers to focus their efforts most efficiently on those individuals most likely to respond to canvassing. </p> <p>An example of a key finding in the US is that Volvo drivers rarely vote Republican. </p> <p>At the heart of Voter Vault is a graph that places the tendency of people to vote against their tendency to vote Conservative. The Tories identify potential voters by taking a list of people who vote - this is publicly available - and setting this against certain pieces of information about them from the national census. They then identify Tory voters by examining the characteristics of 20,000 of their party members to work out what sort of people vote Tory. </p> <p>The two groups are then placed together to identify swing voters - people who vote and who have Tory tendencies. In one study of 340,000 people the Tories achieved an 82% success rate in predicting who would vote for them. </p> <p>Liam Fox, the Tory co-chairman who imported the system, said yesterday: \"This is potentially very significant. In the 2002 mid-term elections in the US, Voter Vault helped the Republicans increase their vote by 4%. This is politics of the margins but this is where elections are won.\" </p> <p>Dr Fox added that Voter Vault gave the Tories a useful advantage over Labour, which was using outdated systems to identify voters by areas. \"Politics is now becoming very fragmented. The days when you could say this is a Labour street or this is a Tory street have gone. You can't even say this is a Tory or a Labour house. Voter Vault allows us to get round that and do 'virtual' canvassing of constituencies.\" </p> <p>Next month's US presidential election will pit the Republicans' Voter Vault technology against the Democrats' equivalent, DataMart, in the first duel between the rival databases. The Republicans have a head start. They used Voter Vault to devastating effect in congressional elections two years ago, focusing their time and resources on voters who were most likely to be persuaded to vote for them. </p> <p>Before 2002, candidates would purchase databases state by state and district by district from a specialist company called Aristotle. Voter Vault was the first true national voter database. </p> <p>It was built by Seattle-based Advanced Custom Software, which - according to PC World magazine - contracted much of the work out to Compulink Systems of Maharashtra in India, leading to questions over whether the data could be stolen while being shipped around the world, and inevitable accusations of \"outsourcing\". The Republicans say all the work on Voter Vault since 2002 has been done in the US. </p> <p>For the 2002 elections, the database sucked in state voter information, census data and membership information from scores of clubs and interest groups. It allowed the Republicans to shape their message to reflect the leanings and concerns of each voter, and to fly President Bush to areas where he would be most effective. </p> <p>\"In the old days people walked and knocked on every door,\" said Michael Cornfield, at the Pew Internet and American Life Project in Washington. \"Now they just knock on the doors where they have reason to believe they'll get a favourable response.\" </p> <p>Partly as a result of their advantage in getting their supporters to the polls, the Republicans won back control of the Senate in 2002 and consolidated their hold on the House of Representatives. </p> <p>Rattled, the Democratic party scrambled to catch up, and has since built up its version of the technology, DataMart, into a list of 166 million voters, just 2 million smaller than Voter Vault. The party has a second electronic contacts book known as Demzilla, of donors and activists. But unlike Voter Vault, neither system has been road tested.</p>",
  "<p>It's hell. It takes it all out of you. It nearly kills you ... It is more difficult than anything else that I have ever done - so I do it.\" Who said this? Matthew Pinsent after winning his fourth rowing gold medal in Athens this summer? Kelly Holmes after struggling back from injury to add the 800m to her 1500m gold? Roger Federer after retaining his Wimbledon title? Lance Armstrong after winning his sixth Tour de France? Jonny Wilkinson on his slow fight-back to form after surgery to his shoulder? The answer is Ernest Hemingway, talking about the rigours of writing world-beating, hairy-chested fiction, and his commitment to going mano-a-mano with a Remington typewriter, a Superman complex and a coldly perspiring demi-litre of Pastis every morning. </p> <p>\"See him now in his caf\u00e9,\" as Alfred Kazin described Hemingway's self-mythologising self-portrait in Paris in the 1920s, \"with his sweatshirt under his shirt, his blue-backed notebook to write in, his two pencils and his little pencil sharpener ... You think this is less of an American fable than Huck Finn on a raft, Ben Franklin waiting for his kite to be hit by lightning?\" </p> <p>His quota of words completed for the day, \"Papa\" was off rolling his shoulders and shadow-boxing round the Deux Magots and La Closerie des Lilas, shouting up his reputation as an outstanding pitcher and hitter on the high-school baseball team, a legendary college footballing ace, to anybody who was willing to listen. </p> <p>The truth, of course, was that Hemingway was nobody's first pick to be on their side. He was a shy boy, hampered by imperfect eyesight, overweight and awkwardly stumbling over his outsized feet. As a ballplayer, his brother Leicester once said, Ernest was a pretty studious reader. His mother used to find him poring over a book, and propose that he go out to play some baseball. \"Aw, mother,\" Ernest would wail, \"I pitch like a hen.\" </p> <p>For all this, and maybe because of it, no major American writer devoted more time and energy to the world of sport. One of his many biographers, Scott Donaldson, has noted that sports are referred to in 43 of Hemingway's first 49 stories, and in a number of cases (\"Big Two-Hearted River\", \"The Undefeated\", \"My Old Man\") are the meat of them. His journalism and correspondence frequently focused on bull-fighting, hunting, and fishing, as did three of his books - Death in the Afternoon, Green Hills of Africa, and The Old Man and the Sea. All he wanted, Hemingway wrote to Lillian Ross in May 1950, was to be champion of the world. </p> <p>He also wanted, like Walt Whitman and many of Hemingway's heirs in contemporary American letters, to be \"regarded as one of the roughs\". So he dined out on apocryphal stories about running away from home, about brawls in and out of the ring, about the tough south-side Chicago neighbourhoods he had frequented. But even in the days when he remained an unpublished writer, not everybody bought it. \"You are to remember that in Paris,\" Ford Madox Ford wrote at the end of that \"lost decade\", the 1920s, \"I have lived for years buried under mountains of middle-westerners who there find it necessary to assume the aspects, voices, accents and behaviours of cowboys crossed with liberal strains of prize-fighters and old-time Bowery toughs.\" </p> <p>In no other novelist was the division between the thinking man and the doing man, the writer and the sportsman, more pronounced than in Hemingway. As Donaldson writes in By Force of Will (1977), Hemingway was \"a man deeply divided against himself, with the most conspicuous split separating the writer, worker and man of feeling on the one hand, from the adventurer, sportsman and man of action on the other\". </p> <p>More than 40 years after Hemingway's death, it is a fracture that some of America's most prominent writers - John Updike, Philip Roth, Don DeLillo, Richard Ford - still feel impelled to try to heal in their fiction. David Foster Wallace, who once described himself as a \"near-great\" tennis junior, took it as the starting point for Infinite Jest (1996) and, at 1,079 pages, produced undisputedly the longest novel about tennis ever written. </p> <p>One of its earliest set-pieces features the young Enfield Tennis Academy prodigy, Hal Cadenza, up for interview by the admissions panel at the University of Arizona, where Wallace himself was a student. The deans on the panel are suspicious of Hal because of an apparent inconsistency between some verbal test scores that have shown him to be \"subnormal\", and the impossible braininess of his essays. It's the braininess that worries them rather than the dumbness which, on a primarily athletics-oriented campus, can be viewed as a \"revenue-raising asset\". </p> <p>As a 10-year-old, Hal's father had been lectured on the futility of book-learning by his own father: \"Those thoughts in your mind are just the sound of your head revving, and head is still just body, Jim.\" Revving heads (mainly Wallace's), and the ponk of tennis balls reverberate throughout Infinite Jest . As an exercise in the inversion of the old Hemingway clich\u00e9 - rather than the writer who thinks he's lean and mean and a bit of a bruiser, the athlete who is a brain - it is berserkly, and sometimes brilliantly, cerebral. </p> <p>Infinite Jest's most obvious antecedents are the postmodern metafictions of John Barth, Thomas Pynchon and Robert Coover, in particular Coover's The Universal Baseball Association (1968). DeLillo and Roth wrote early, loosely experimental novels that also dealt in a surreal-satirical way with sport. Both DeLillo's End Zone (1972), which was about gridiron football and nuclear fission, and The Great American Novel (1973), which saw Roth cutting loose in the tale of America's only homeless big-league baseball team, were the antithesis of everything the virulently anti-abstractionist Hemingway thought good writing should be. \"Artist, art, artistic!\" he was once heard to rant. \"Can't we ever hear the last of that stuff?\" </p> <p>As its title indicates, The Great American Novel was intended as a commentary on the fervid competition between Roth, Norman Mailer, Bernard Malamud and their contemporaries in the 50s and 60s. An extended scat on winning - \"Oh, you really can't say enough good things about it ... Win hands down, win going away, win by a landslide, win by accident - you just can't beat it, however you slice it. Winning is the tops\" - is obviously meant to be a satirical take on the infamous letter Papa sent to the publisher Charles Scribner in 1949: \"Tried for Mr Turgenieff first and it wasn't too hard. Tried for Mr Maupassant and it took four of the best stories to beat him . ... Mr Henry James I would just thumb him once the first time he grabbed then hit him once where he had no balls.\" </p> <p>Roth hammers home the point by having \"Hemingway\" send a telegraph message in The Great American Novel: \"To Messrs Hawthorne, Melville, Twain and James, in care of the Department of Literatoor, Vassar College, New York. Dear Illustrious Dead: The Great American Novelist, c'est moi. Signed, Papa.\" </p> <p>The irony here is that The Great American Novel is as testosterone-charged and swaggeringly, preposterously ambitious as any of the pumped-up works by rival writers that it tries to take down. Al Alvarez touched on a further irony in these pages a few weeks ago. Writing about Roth's scandalous success with Portnoy's Complaint , Alvarez noted that \"when it was published in 1969 it seemed to epitomise the anarchic spirit of the decade. Maybe it did, but the author himself (b.1933) was a product of the 1950s, the last generation of well-behaved, sternly educated children who believed in high culture and high principles ... Portnoy was considered outrageous when it appeared, but the real outrage was Roth's and he was outraged because he couldn't help being a good boy however much he yearned to be bad.\" </p> <p>DeLillo (b.1933) and Updike (b.1932) also came of age in the clean-cut 50s; Richard Ford was born a decade later (1944) but he too grew up through the jutting-jawed Eisenhower years. With Roth and Wallace, these writers have produced some of the landmark American novels of recent times. And Independence Day (Ford), Underworld (DeLillo), American Pastoral (Roth), Infinite Jest and even Updike's Rabbit tetralogy are all, in one way or another and to greater or lesser degrees, about sport. </p> <p>Images of sportsmen and sportswomen have become swarmingly ubiquitous in the electronic society of the image in which we live. It is sports stars, we are told, rather than Hollywood or music industry figures, who can swing next month's election for George W Bush. At every campaign stop-over, local baseball heroes and National Football League Hall of Famers are wheeled out to endorse the president with a sporting metaphor: \"He's made the right calls time and again and he's got the scorecard to prove it!\" Cue high-fives, pseudo-military salutes and manly bear-hugs. </p> <p>But only 80 years ago even baseball, now regarded as the American national pastime, was considered to be slightly disreputable. In many ways it took a writer, Ring Lardner, in his daily newspaper column and, later, his phenomenally popular syndicated short stories, to make it respectable. Lardner wrote his baseball column for five years in Chicago between 1908 and 1913, and continued to cover big games until the early 20s, though he became somewhat disillusioned after the so-called Black Sox scandal of 1919, when the Chicago team contrived with a betting syndicate to lose the World Series. The legendary \"fix\" has been immortalised by a reference to it in The Great Gatsby (1925); Scott Fitzgerald and Lardner had become friends and drinking partners - two of America's \"deepest drinkers\", Lardner liked to joke - while living in Great Neck, Long Island, in 1923, and Fitzgerald introduced Lardner to his (and Hemingway's) editor, Maxwell Perkins. But they never succeeded in persuading Lardner to write a novel, or, for that matter, as David Lodge has written, \"to put his stories before the public with the dignity appropriate to a modern literary master\". </p> <p>Writing in 1925 in praise of Lardner's experiments with the American vernacular, Virginia Woolf concluded that \"it is no coincidence that the best of Mr Lardner's stories are about games, for one may guess that Mr Lardner's interest in games has solved one of the most difficult problems of the American writer; it has given him a clue, a centre, a meeting place for the diverse activities of people whom a vast continent isolates, whom no tradition controls. Games give him what society gives his English brother.\" </p> <p>Lardner died of TB brought on by excessive drinking in 1933, aged 48, and when Fitzgerald wrote his friend's obituary, he allowed his frustration to show. He traced Lardner's \"cynical attitude towards his work\" back to his youthful infatuation with baseball: \"During those years, when most men of promise achieve an adult education, if only in the school of war, Ring moved in the company of a few dozen illiterates playing a boy's game. A boy's game, with no more possibilities in it than a boy could master, a game bounded by walls which kept out novelty or danger, change or adventure.\" </p> <p>Lardner came from a prosperous mid-western farming family, and enjoyed a comfortable, almost idyllic upbringing. He trained his ear for bar-room slang and lively gutter language travelling with the \"illiterates\" of the White Sox baseball team. Spectator sports, although still in their infancy, were a ready route out of poverty, then as now, for new Americans, and locker rooms became a forcing ground for the improvised, hybridised kind of English that Lardner started putting into his stories and Hemingway wasn't alone in picking up on. He inscribed a copy of Death in the Afternoon (1932), \"To Ring Lardner, from his early imitator and always admirer\". But this didn't stop Papa rounding on the multitude of impersonators of his early, plain-spoken fictions. \"You bastards have stolen my prose style\", Roth has him explode in The Great American Novel . \"Every shithead sportswriter in America has stolen my style and then gone and fucked it up so bad that I can't even use it anymore without becoming sick to my stomach.\" </p> <p>In an essay for the New York Times 40 years ago, the British football writer Brian Glanville (author of the football novel The Rise of Gerry Logan) joined Orwell in comparing the rich American vernacular with the thin gruel of standard English and \"the deadness of middle-class speech\". Cricket, Glanville noted, \"a haven for the belletrist and the literary romantic, has yet to produce a single piece of serious fiction about the professional game\", and that remains the case today. The rough world of northern Rugby League, on the other hand, at the time Glanville was writing, had just produced David Storey's This Sporting Life (1960), a novel by a miner's son who became an art student, and travelled north every weekend to play for Leeds Reserves. It had an authenticity, Glanville believed, which was guaranteed by Storey's own experience; no stranger to the Rugby League milieu and Yorkshire mining background could have hoped to write it. </p> <p>By putting the narrator of his breakthrough novel The Sportswriter (1986) into the trade of the title, Ford encouraged readers of his earlier, \"dirty realist\" stories to expect a book fetid with the smells of wintergreen and embrocation and astringent. And though, in the course of the novel, Frank Bascombe does travel to Detroit to profile a former star footballer who is now a paraplegic, and visits the offices of the magazine that employs him in New York, The Sportswriter is a novel that stays resolutely in anti-heroic mode. It is virtually all interior monologue; a (frequently very funny) meditation on the routine and the mundane, with numerous digressions on what Bascombe has learned about life-through-sport. \"Athletes, by and large, are people who are happy to let their actions speak for them, happy to be what they do. As a result, when you talk to an athlete, as I do all the time ...he's never likely to feel the least bit divided, or alienated, or one ounce of existential dread.\" </p> <p>This patent untruth - which in many ways is the subject of Roth's American Pastoral, the story of an all-American, sun-blessed athlete, patriotic, dutiful, simple-seeming, bland as butter, who turns out to be wracked by uninmaginable existential dread - is reiterated by DeLillo in End Zone: \"Football players are simple folk. Whatever complexities, whatever dark politics of the human mind, the heart - the football player travels the straightest of lines. His thoughts are wholesomely commonplace, his actions uncomplicated by history, enigma, holocaust or dream.\" </p> <p>By the time of Independence Day (1995), Ford's follow-up novel, his sportswriter Bascombe has moved on to become a buyer and seller of property and father of an estranged, violently delinquent son. To try to heal their relationship, and acting on something he has said in the earlier novel, that \"talking about sport ... is a pretty innocent part of people, and talking has the effect of bringing us all together\", Bascombe sets out with Paul on a \"hombre-to-hombre\" tour of all the sporting Halls of Fame they can fit into the July 4 weekend. The trip ends in near-disaster when Paul beans himself - maybe accidentally, maybe not - by putting his head in the way of a ball being pelted out of a pitching machine in Cooperstown, NY. </p> <p>Ford, who spent the first 18 years of his life \"unlettered as a porch monkey\", is a self-identified sports nut. In \"The Three Kings\", an appreciation of Hemingway, Faulkner and Fitzgerald, he wrote that \"Some boys, alas, do not come to serious reading, nor God knows to serious writing, precisely like hounds to round steak. Though, then again, special boys sometimes do.\" </p> <p>Ford is a southerner, from Jackson, Mississippi. Updike, Roth and DeLillo are all from the north-eastern United States. Updike and Roth have described their home neighbourhoods so insistently, and occasionally rapturously, over the years that their work contains pictures of Shillington, Pennsylvania and the Weequahic section of Newark, New Jersey, so complete that, as Joyce once remarked of Dublin, \"if the city one day suddenly disappeared from the earth it could be reconstructed out of my book\". </p> <p>DeLillo grew up in the Bronx, but it wasn't until Underworld (1997), his 11th novel, that he approached material which was clearly autobiographical. In the closing section, set in the early 1950s, Nick Shay, the main protagonist, is depicted as a rough-tongued delinquent, helling around with girls and drink and the local poolroom hoodlums. But the close reader may suspect that it is Nick's studious, chess-playing brother who offers a truer picture of the authorial alter-ego. </p> <p>Little Matty Shay is \"pale with an indoor passion\", like Dale, the computer nerd in Updike's Roger's Version . (Like, in fact, Seldon Wishnow, the little loser who lives downstairs from the Roths in The Plot Against America . Seldon throws a ball like a girl; all he likes to do is play chess. He wants to be a friend of Philip's and walk to school with him; Philip can't wait to see the back of him.) </p> <p>Updike has written marvellously about sport, especially golf, in articles and stories. But until he was an adult, the series of afflictions he enumerates in Self-Consciousness (1989) - psoriasis, asthma, claustrophobia, hydrophobia, arachnophobia, insomnia, poor teeth, a tendency to choke and a spectacular stammer - prevented him having much of a sporting life. The four Rabbit novels, published at intervals of roughly a decade between 1960 and 1990, are of course about a great deal more than Harry \"Rabbit\" Angstrom's regret about his finest hour as a star of the college basketball team being way behind him: they are about race and terrorist attack, the legacy of Vietnam, the sexual revolution, the disintegration of the American landscape and the apparently unstoppable, runaway expansion of what Roth has called \"the indigenous American berserk\". </p> <p>But the 1,500 pages of the tetralogy begin and end with Harry doing what he has always done when he wants to feel most within himself: sneakered-up, running and leaping with a ball. \"That tan pebbled roundness, the smooth seams between, the little circlet for taking the air valve.\" It is Harry's last conscious moment before a heart-attack kills him on-court. \"A big pebbled ball that wants to fly.\" </p> <p>\"What is it with ballplayers?\" Martin Amis wonders in Money (1985), as the crapulous John Self is being humiliated in a game of tennis by an athletic Hollywood type. \"What is it about roundness that they understand better than we do? The world is round. They understand that too.\" </p> <p>A close, almost forensic, even fetishistic attention to the plastic fact of the ball - its size, weight, consistency, colour, texture, resiliency and liveliness - is a striking feature of all these books, all written of course by men. Ford does it in Independence Day (a baseball is the object that has almost killed Bascombe's son). Wallace does it with \"a dirty green dead old\" Slazenger in Infinite Jest: \"Perfectly round. Even distribution of mass. But empty inside ... Nothing in there but evacuated air that smells like a kind of rubber hell.\" Roth does it over several pages in The Great American Novel, and then again over several more pages, a few chapters further on, but takes 30 years to tell us, in American Pastoral , what he might have been getting at: that the \"Moby Dick-coloured\" balls in the museum showcase are nostalgic remnants of an era when \"orderliness [was] a natural condition, daily living a simple story tangibly unfolding, a deeply unagitating story, the fluctuations predictable, the combat containable, the surprises satisfying\". </p> <p>In Mao II , DeLillo's writer-hero Bill Gray lies awake at night \"going down the batting order of the 1938 Cleveland Indians\": \"I do batting orders in my head all the time. And I've been trying to write toward that kind of innocence ever since ... There hasn't been a moment since those days when I've felt nearly so good.\" </p> <p> Underworld , the book DeLillo wrote after Mao II , has been called America's great love song to baseball. In the novel, collectors compete to possess the ball that won a legendary game played in New York in 1951. They want to possess the ball - \"this little spheroid fact\" - so that they can possess a moment pre-dating television when people \"did something great just by being there ... - decades ago when things were not replayed and worn out and run down and used up before midnight of the first day\". The ball has come into Nick Shay's keeping, at a price: $34,500. He keeps it on a bookshelf in the bedroom, \"wedged in a corner between straight-up books and slanted books, tented under books, unceremoniously\". On nights he can't sleep, he weighs the ball in his hand, examining the seams, the rough spots and stains on the horsehide. \"This is the thing that will pulse in his brain come old age and double vision and dizzy spells - the surge sensation, the leap of people already standing, that bolt of noise and joy when the ball went in.\" </p> <p>There is an echo of Fitzgerald here, and Tom Buchanan in Gatsby, \"who would drift on forever, seeking, a little wistfully, for the dramatic turbulence of some irrecoverable football game\". An echo of Fitzgerald himself who, until the end of his life, would mingle with the crowds in the big university stadia and eventually died of a heart attack annotating an article in the Princeton Alumni Weekly. In his copy of the magazine, a pencil line still runs wildly down a page of a story about football. </p> <p>Part of the lure of Ivy League matches for Fitzgerald was that, in their liveries and traditions, they seemed timeless. \"Baseball's time is seamless and invisible,\" the game's chief laureate, Roger Angell, has written, \"a bubble within which players move at exactly the same pace and rhythms as all their predecessors. This is the way the game was played in our youth, and in our fathers' youth, and even back then - back in the country days - there must have been the feeling that time could be stopped.\" </p> <p>In this way it's like reading; it's like writing. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong>Gordon Burn's book about George Best will be published by Faber and Faber next year.</p>",
  "<p>Downtown Washington DC is far too preoccupied with the exercise of power to waste much energy on glitzy, New York-style displays of it, and the result - evident in its self-effacing architecture and the blue-shirted uniformity of its male workers - sometimes underwhelms first-time visitors. The lack of grandeur extends from the White House (always smaller than tourists had imagined) to the offices of the celebrated investigative journalist Seymour Hersh, who works out of two tiny, messy rooms overlooking a dingy parking lot and several air-conditioning units affixed to neighbouring walls. Inside, you have to look carefully amid the stacks of legal pads, half-opened mail and old magazines to find the Pulitzer prize, framed low on the wall alongside a few other awards. \"For a long time I didn't put them up there,\" says Hersh, distractedly leafing through a heap of documents in search of a newspaper clipping. \"I thought it would look kinda pretentious. By the way,\" he adds, gesturing in passing to a cardboard box by the window, \"I've got all the original Abu Ghraib photographs in there. And plenty more that nobody's seen.\" </p> <p>Hersh's glancing reference to the cardboard box belies its importance; the future of the American adventure in the Middle East, not to mention that of president George Bush, may yet be decided by it. It was Hersh's New Yorker cover story, in May, that revealed the full extent of torture by US military personnel at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq, building on an initial CBS news report. Since then, in his new book, Chain of Command, Hersh has traced responsibility for prisoner abuses, at Abu Ghraib and Guant\u00e1namo Bay, to the upper reaches of the Bush administration. The revelations have capped an impressive run of stories since September 11 in which Hersh has convincingly accused the White House and the Pentagon of ignoring and manipulating the intelligence services and the military in the preparation, execution and aftermath of the Iraq war. </p> <p>It has all happened at a stage in Hersh's career - he is 67 - when other journalists might have been content to start winding down. He does not lack laurels on which to rest: famously, as a 32-year-old freelance reporter, Hersh broke the story of the My Lai massacre in the Vietnam war, exposing the murder of hundreds of civilians by US troops. But he shows no yearning for retirement, nor for any comfortable career-twilight job in senior management. \"Sy's mind is like a loose electrical line, just sparking around all the time, bounding in two or three directions, and September 11 and the New Yorker have rejuvenated him and brought that back,\" says Bill Kovach, his former editor at the New York Times's Washington bureau. The late surge, argues New Yorker editor David Remnick, proves \"that energy level has nothing to do with the statistics of age. Sy is by no means old, but he's had his driver's licence for a number of years. And yet he just has this energy.\" </p> <p>Many might prefer that he did not. Bush has reportedly told the Pakistani leader Pervez Musharraf that Hersh is \"a liar\"; in statements to the media, the Pentagon routinely accuses him of errors, though it rarely mentions specifics (one spokesman claimed that he \"[throws] a lot of crap against the wall and expects someone to peel off what's real\"). The greatest vitriol, though, has come from the former Pentagon adviser and leading neo-conservative Richard Perle, who, Hersh alleged, improperly mixed his business interests with his influence over US foreign policy when meeting the Saudi arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi in January 2003. In a furious television interview, Perle called Hersh \"the closest thing American journalism has to a terrorist\", and spent a year threatening to sue him for libel. In February 2004 Perle resigned from his position on the Defence Policy Board. He later became embroiled in a new controversy relating to his former role as a director of Hollinger International, the media group, where he worked alongside the disgraced Telegraph tycoon Conrad Black. </p> <p>\"The funny thing is, I always liked Perle,\" Hersh says, slicing into an omelette at breakfast in the Tabard Inn, a dimly lit Washington fixture yards from his office. \"I used to go to his house all the time. He had this ratty little dog, named Reagan, which he loved. And Perle really knew what was going on... We had a friendship, based on the fact that he's very smart. The greed I didn't worry about. It was always there.\" But these are strange days, and now the silent, hostile contempt of the Bush administration, Hersh says, transcends all modern precedents. Take the defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld: \"He was somebody who always returned phone calls. He could be very funny. He's very sharp. And then something happened to these guys on 9/11. It's with us or against us. Fax after fax unanswered... The truth is, they really don't care - certainly not about the New Yorker, but not that much either about the New York Times or the Washington Post or the [television] networks. They've got talk radio. They've got Fox News. I think they truly don't care. And now I heard - I don't know if it's true - I heard Rumsfeld's going around whining, complaining that he thought we were friends, and why am I doing this to him...\" If it is true, it seems somewhat hypocritical on the defence secretary's part: recently, Hersh learned that Rumsfeld had sought to have him investigated by the FBI as long ago as 1975. </p> <p>Hersh's conversation is rapid-fire, endlessly digressive, mock-grouchy, laden with profanity, as well as vigorously opinionated: in person, and sometimes in print, he makes little effort to emulate the buttoned-up neutrality of most of his American peers. (His telephone manner is legendarily abrupt, too: he frequently starts in the middle of a thought, and hangs up without warning.) It is not immediately obvious that this style would be conducive to encouraging a nervous CIA source, for example, to confide in him. And yet over the past four decades he has built up a contacts book of mid-and senior-level figures that seems unmatched in Washington, except by Bob Woodward. Most of his sources are instinctively right-wing, he says, while Hersh is a registered Democrat. But such party political differences have always been surmountable when it really mattered. \"Clearly, a group of people decided early on that there was going to be an alternate history [to the officially sanctioned one], and that they would help me do it,\" Hersh says. \" There's a lot of integrity in the military and the intelligence services. A lot of the guys are good guys. But it's very hard for them - if you spend 25 years getting to the point where you're going to be the commander of a corps, or something, it's very hard to risk throwing it over. On the other hand, these guys are in loco parentis. They really suffer, because kids [in the military] are being killed for stupid reasons.\" He is unrestrained in his criticisms of current policy, calling the president's accounts of the Iraq situation \"hallucinatory\". As for Guant\u00e1namo, he adds, \"the idea of my country disappearing people without telling anybody is just so heinous, so wrong. We could fight the war on terrorism without resorting to illegal means.\" </p> <p>After a career spent hopping from the world of freelancing to big-name publications and back again, Hersh's arrival at the New Yorker has helped quicken the pace of a traditionally stately publication, repositioning it at the front of the news agenda - and contributing, doubtless, to a reported 20% sales increase since Remnick took the helm. Former New Yorker editors such as William Shawn, fabled for giving his writers months or even years to turn in copy, might be appalled to learn that Hersh woke Remnick in a hotel room at 3am recently to update him on his discoveries. \"He was in California. I called him on his cellphone. I didn't know what time it was,\" Hersh says, by way of self-justification. \"And by the way, it wasn't as if he was wonderfully cheerful about it. He said, 'You fuck, it's the middle of the night. Call me tomorrow'.\" </p> <p>Chicago in the 1930s and 1940s was a city steeped in the American tradition of muckraking journalism, and with the city's flamboyantly corrupt politics, there was plenty of muck to rake. It seems fitting, therefore, that Chicago also spawned the nation's two greatest living investigative reporters. In the well-to-do neighbourhood of Wheaton, Bob Woodward, later to break the Watergate scandal with Carl Bernstein, was born; on the city's scrappy South Side, home to a large and poor African-American minority, Isidore and Dorothy Hersh produced Seymour Myron, born on April 8 1937, with a twin brother, Alan, who became a sound engineer. Isidore and Dorothy were immigrants from Lithuania and Poland, respectively, and they were largely apolitical, Hersh recalls, the family's attention being fully absorbed with getting by financially. Young Sy helped out with his father's dry-cleaning business. \"My father was smart, I think, but uneducated,\" Hersh says. \"He died when I was 16, so we never had a heart-to-heart. He was always remote.\" </p> <p>The University of Chicago was building a worldwide reputation as an academic powerhouse in sociology and urban studies, but though Hersh lived nearby, he claims he was barely aware of it. After an energetic but unspectacular school career, he enrolled at the local junior college, up the street from his family's flat, but a few days into the term a professor took him aside. \"He said: 'What are you doing here?' And he walked me to the University of Chicago. I got enrolled, paid almost no tuition. Maybe a hundred bucks a year.\" At Chicago, he met his wife Elizabeth Klein, a psychoanalyst. He trained as a lawyer for a year, but dropped out, winding up as a copy boy, then a reporter, for the local City News Bureau. Hersh sometimes tells an anecdote that encapsulates the prejudices and complacency of the 1960s journalism on which he cut his teeth. It happened while he was telephoning copy to the newsdesk, having just witnessed a family of eight laid out dead in the street after a multiple murder and suicide, and it was summarised recently in the Chicago Tribune: </p> <p>\"Ah, my good, dear, energetic Mr Hersh,\" the editor began. \"Were the alas, poor, unfortunate victims of the Negro persuasion?\" </p> <p>\"Yes, sir,\" Hersh confirmed. </p> <p>The editor's orders were curt: \"Cheap it out.\" </p> <p>Hersh dutifully produced a one-paragraph story that said, as he recalls: \"Eight people, all black, were killed in a fire that raged through a house on the South Side today.\" </p> <p>After a period as an army press officer, Hersh ended up at the Associated Press in Washington, where he rose through the ranks. He then briefly worked as an aide to the Democrat senator Eugene McCarthy before quickly returning to journalism, but there appears to have been no warning that his diffuse energies were about to be channelled into the story from which there would be no looking back: My Lai. \"I wasn't editor of the Yale Daily News, or the Harvard Crimson,\" Hersh says today with unmistakeable pride, \"and 11 years after getting into college, I'm sticking two fingers into the eye of a Republican president, getting prizes and enough money to buy my first house. I mean, it's a pretty amazing society we live in.\" </p> <p>My Lai began in 1969 on a single mysterious tip-off, and Hersh followed it partly out of financial necessity: he was freelancing for an unproven new syndication agency, the Dispatch News Service, and needed every penny he could find. He received word from a military lawyer that a soldier at Fort Benning, an Army base in Georgia, was facing a court marshal for murdering at least 109 Vietnamese civilians. As Remnick notes in the introduction to Chain of Command, Hersh simply went door-to-door at Fort Benning, trying to avoid the authorities, until he found William Calley, a 26-year-old soldier. The two men bought steaks and bourbon and repaired to the home of Calley's girlfriend. Calley talked - and Hersh learned the first details of what would become a horrific account of mass murder in the Vietnamese hamlet of Son My, known on army maps as My Lai 4. \"They shot some from helicopters, others from the ground and at point-blank range,\" Remnick writes. \"There were rapes, torture, target practice using babies.\" At least 500 non-combatants died. Hersh was naturally appalled, but his first thought, he recalls, was \"Pulitzer prize. My career's made if I do this right.\" Thirty-six newspapers took the story. Some who read it did not want to countenance its truth: one reporter, dispatched to follow it up, rang him and called him a liar and a son-of-a-bitch. Hersh remembers being \"scared\" by such attacks, but he kept reporting the story, adding more shaming details. The Pulitzer duly followed in 1970. </p> <p>In the case of My Lai, as in Abu Ghraib, Hersh seemed energised not so much by finding evildoers within the military as by exposing the institutions that enabled individuals to act as they did. (In Vietnam, the racism was commonplace enough to be known, among US soldiers, as the \"Mere Gook Rule\".) Nicholas Lemann, a former colleague at the Atlantic Monthly and now dean of the Columbia School of Journalism in New York, argues that Hersh is not driven by ideology: \"He really is not interested in opinion. Like many investigative reporters, he is essentially prosecutorial - he goes in and he tries to get stuff. His art is getting the shocking material that nobody else has.\" David Remnick acknowledges his more recent anti-Bush distribes but thinks that Hersh's own politics are of secondary importance: \"I'm not ignorant of the fact that he has certain feelings about things. We're citizens as well as reporters. It's interesting that Sy has opinions, but opinions are like saltshakers: we all have them.\" </p> <p>Another trait Hersh shares with many investigative reporters is his willingness to bask in the limelight - \"fame, fortune, glory, it's all part of the deal\", he says - but if his My Lai scoop sounds like a classic journalism movie, there is good reason why no such film has ever been made. Hersh openly disdains the self-referential colour that many contemporary reporters actively seek. As he notes, \"if My Lai took place today, I wouldn't have written the book I wrote [ My Lai 4, 1970, a comprehensive account that drew together his earlier stories]. I would have written a book about how I did it - the knocking on doors. Actually, I had written maybe three pages on the chase, and I remember my editor said, 'Ah, why don't we cut it down to a page?'\" </p> <p>Film people call him now and then to inquire about making a movie, he says, \"but why would I want to that?\" He gets enough attention through his stories, he says. \"I have a vast amount of mail about Abu Ghraib. I'm not trying to discourage people from writing, but you should [read] the mail from the people whose fillings are being used by the CIA for eavesdropping.\" He sighs. Being recognised in the street, he says, \"gets me unnerved. That means I can't pick my nose in public anymore, and that's a downer.\" </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, perhaps, Hersh will speak little of his personal life, but Kovach reckons there isn't much to reveal: Hersh, he says, lives to work, though he is an enthusiastic tennis player. \"His wife has domesticated him slightly - they go to dinners, but he goes because he has to eat, not because he enjoys eating. All he wants to do is talk and find things out. I suppose they go to a movie once in a while. Maybe he watches some television.\" </p> <p>His refusal to dramatise the details of his own work is one of many frequently noted contrasts between Hersh and Woodward. All The President's Men, the book Woodward wrote with Bernstein about Watergate, is precisely what My Lai 4 is not: a compelling account of the journalistic process. Woodward's recent books on the administration, Bush At War and Plan Of Attack, meanwhile, sometimes obsess over tiny details of the Colin-Powell-put-down-his-coffee-cup variety. In other ways, too, the two reporters have ended up as opposites. \"Bob has become the diarist of sitting administrations, and Sy has continued to be the muckraker,\" Kovach says. \"Sy continues his outrage, and Bob has become the recorder of the official story in Washington.\" </p> <p>Hersh refuses to discuss their different approaches - doing so, he has said, would be tantamount to \"self-immolation\". But he denies the popular wisdom that he is bitterly envious of Woodward's wealth. On the topic of daily American news reporting, though, he is blistering. \"I don't understand the business anymore,\" he says. \"It's as if all words are weighted equal. So Cheney says electing Kerry is going to bring more [terrorist] attacks, and the press carries that without saying that he proffered no evidence, offered no intelligence. That should be in the second paragraph! 'Without offering any rational basis for making the statement...'\" Perhaps the best hope for investigative journalism, though, is the internet: Lemann compares Hersh's My Lai work to that of weblog writers today. \"For investigative journalism, you need a socially turbulent era, combined with a lowering of the bar of access to media,\" he says. At the time of My Lai, cold type production systems were starting to reduce the costs of producing a newspaper; the internet has rendered the price of access to the media universe vanishingly small. </p> <p>Another Pulitzer prize - or something close - must have seemed in the offing in the mid-1990s, when Hersh first saw a stash of documents alleging that John F Kennedy had succumbed to a blackmail plot by Marilyn Monroe, who was threatening to make details of their relationship public. Hersh had spent the middle part of his career working for the New York Times. Now freelancing, he appeared to have discovered the evidence that would guarantee the success of his book-in-progress, The Dark Side of Camelot (1998). \"Those documents seemed great,\" Hersh recalls. \"I absolutely believed them.\" He prepared a chapter on the blackmail plot, and rumours of the documents fuelled the buzz surrounding the book. Hersh had hired a forensic expert to make sure all was in order. When the expert announced in early 1997 that they were probably fake, it was not too late to discard them. But it was too late for Hersh's professional reputation to avoid a damaging hit. </p> <p>The book was panned. In a typically harsh review, the critic Edward Jay Epstein derided Hersh for unconvincingly portraying Kennedy as \"a sex maniac, marital cheat, bigamist, speed freak, liar and corrupt politician... What is such a radical revision based on? Hersh claims his evidence is both new and substantiated. But, to paraphrase Dr Johnson, much of what can be substantiated in this book is not new, and much of what is new, including his most sensational findings, cannot be substantiated.\" (\"Books are not his strength,\" Kovach says simply. \"Sy needs to be out there all day, every day, digging up stuff, and you don't do that when you're writing a book.\") </p> <p>Missteps may be an inevitable by-product of the investigative trade, and the Camelot forgeries were not Hersh's only error. Arguably more seriously, in 1974 Hersh accused the US ambassador to Chile, Edward Korry, of knowing about a CIA plot to overthrow the Chilean president, Salvador Allende. Years later, when he discovered he was wrong, Hersh wrote what amounted to a correction - a lengthy story placed embarrassingly on page one of the New York Times. \"I told [editor Abe] Rosenthal about it, and he said, well, you fucked him in print, you better fix him. I didn't want to do it.\" Controversy has also dogged Hersh's 25,000-word investigation, published in the New Yorker in 2001, into alleged war crimes committed as US troops left the scene of the 1991 Gulf war. </p> <p>\"To be fair to [Hersh], he's almost unique among American journalists in not wanting to hide his bad stories,\" says Jack Shafer, the Slate magazine press writer who has been one of Hersh's most vocal critics. \"We all get taken in by sources. We all see documents, or conduct interviews, where a source gets the better of us. The important thing [in the Kennedy case] is that he didn't publish.\" Nevertheless, Shafer finds fault with Hersh's tendency to combine the roles of investigative and interpretive journalist. \"Take his coverage of the early stages of the attack on Afghanistan. The investigative reporter will be coming up with weaknesses in today's CIA. But the interpretive reporter will be relying too much on retired CIA guys who say today's CIA sucks.\" Hersh's predictions, Shafer notes, have often proved seriously off-target - such as when he quoted sources suggesting that the then CIA director, George Tenet, would be gone within months of 9/11. (In fact, he left his post only this year.) \"But I am a great believer in the right of journalists to get it wrong,\" Shafer says. \"If readers want something 100% accurate, they should wait five years for someone to do a PhD dissertation on it.\" </p> <p>Hersh's work is absolutely reliant on off-the-record informants, of course, but he says the New Yorker controls the process tightly. His contacts deep inside the CIA and the Pentagon trust the magazine sufficiently to talk to its fact-checkers directly; their identities are known to Remnick. Sometimes the checking process yields new information: \"Particularly when you get on to sensitive stuff, they will explain to a checker things they I assumed I know, that I don't know.\" It all sounds wonderfully collaborative, but Hersh's day-to-day relationship with his colleagues is as combative as ever. \"I go off the deep end. I scream and rant and rave,\" he says. \"But they don't take me seriously.\" He pauses, reflecting. \"Editors are weird.\" </p> <p>It might be tempting to argue that Hersh has a strong professional interest in the re-election of Bush - a second term seems more likely to supply further scandals than would a Kerry administration - but he does not indulge the suggestion. \"I don't know if I could do it for four more years,\" he says. \"It's no fun always up against the grinder. And if Bush were defeated - oh, my God, I could write a great book about how he did it all. How nine people took down the American military, the Congress, the press and the federal bureaucracy. Overran it. How did they do it? I don't mean that in a philosophical way. I mean what were those early encounters, those crunch points - the early meetings where it became clear that, if you crossed them, you were gone?\" </p> <p>Back in his office, after breakfast, Hersh is fired with enthusiasm for such a project, but doubts that November will bring the hoped-for Republican defeat. He is sceptical, too, about journalism's capacity to do much at all in the face of a White House behaving as this one does. \"Listen,\" he says, \"I could get a photograph of George Bush sticking a feather up the backside of somebody at Abu Ghraib, and Kitty Kelley could get a video of him performing an abortion, and he'd still be able to doubletalk his way out of it. It's...\" </p> <p>But the telephone is ringing. </p> <p>\"Hello?\" he barks, rising to his feet, receiver in hand. A brief conversation with a contact follows; Hersh's contributions are largely telegraphic until towards the end. \"Yeah, I've got something on the Israel story,\" he says at last. \"But it's totally opposite. And much worse. I can't talk about it now - I've got someone with me. Say hello to your wife.\" And he hangs up. </p> <p><strong>Life at a glance</strong></p> <p><strong> Seymour Myron Hersh</strong><br> </p> <p><strong> Born: </strong> April 8 1937 Chicago. </p> <p><strong> Education: </strong> Hyde Park High School, Chicago; University of Chicago; BA 1958.</p> <p><strong>Married: </strong> 1964 Elizabeth Klein, (two sons, one daughter). </p> <p><strong> Career highlights: </strong> 1959 Chicago City News Bureau; 1966 AP Pentagon correspondent; 1969, broke My Lai story as a freelancer; 1972-1979, New York Times; 1979 onwards: book writing, contributions to Atlantic Monthly, New Yorker. </p> <p><strong> Books: </strong> 1968 Chemical and Biological Warfare; '70 My Lai 4; '72 Cover-up: the Army's Secret Investigation of the Massacre at My Lai 4; '83 The Price of Power: Kissinger in the Nixon White House; '86 The Target is Destroyed: What Really Happened to Flight 007 and What America Knew About It; '91 The Samson Option: Israel's Nuclear Arsenal and American Foreign Policy; '97 The Dark Side of Camelot; '98 Against All Enemies: Gulf War Syndrome; 2004 Chain of Command: The Road from 9/11 to Abu Ghraib. </p> <p><strong> Some awards: </strong> 1970 Pulitzer prize; 2004 National Magazine Award. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Chain of Command is published by Allen Lane at \u00a317.99.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Cuba: A New History</strong> by Richard Gott<br> 384pp, Yale, <strong>\u00a318.99 </strong><br> </p> <p>All too often, Cuba conjures up images of a last communist stronghold, Fidel Castro's beard and an American military base holding Afghan prisoners. Richard Gott's invaluable Cuba: A New History dispels many convenient myths. Gott, a frequent visitor to the island, guides us through its troubled history, from the first colonisation by the Spanish in 1511 to the present day. </p> <p>It is a savage story. Even Diego de Vel\u00e1squez, who began with the intention of treating the Indians well, became brutal when they refused to work for foreign invaders. By the early 17th century, Africans brought in as slaves formed half the total population. Racism was always endemic. </p> <p>With the brief British occupation of Havana in 1762, however, the city suddenly became an international port, and North American tradesmen set up business there. Initially, the struggle for Cuban independence involved war with Spain, in which Jos\u00e9 Marti, the great 19th-century poet, was a notable fighter. The United States began to take an interest in the Cuban-Spanish conflict only after the US battleship Maine - which had not been on a war footing - exploded in Havana in 1898, with the loss of 258 American lives. After the ensuing war, the US occupied Cuba for four years. </p> <p>When a new Cuban party, the Independent Party of Colour, was formed in 1907 and launched an armed protest movement five years later, US Marines arrived to protect American sugar cane estates, and in the repression that followed, some 3,000 black Cubans were killed. </p> <p>The influence of Communism, as Gott skilfully explains, now became pervasive. Cuban Socialists were impressed by the Russian Revolution and formed an embryonic Communist Party in 1925. Several of its members were Jewish immigrants from eastern Europe. Significantly, the Communists had no prejudice against blacks taking a leadership role in the party. A revolutionary junta was set up in September 1933, led by a mulatto typist named Fulgencio Batista. A university professor, Dr Ram\u00f3n Grau San Mart\u00edn, was chosen as Cuba's new president. He refused to service the debt on American loans and nationalised the Cuban American sugar mills. However, Fidel Castro, in a highly significant 1985 comment aptly cited by Gott, sniped at Grau's - and, by implication, Batista's - claim to be revolutionary in character. </p> <p>The fact is that Communists were allowed to operate legally under Batista and even to launch their own newspaper, Hoy. In return, the Communists promised Batista the political support he lacked. During the second world war, Batista himself became President of Cuba and ruled as a social democrat, welcoming Communists into his government. </p> <p>On July 26 1953, Fidel Castro led an armed attack on the Moncada fortress barracks in Santiago - Cuba's second city. He was arrested after the assault failed and served less than two years in jail before being amnestied by Batista. I would have welcomed more details to explain why Castro was already so convinced that armed insurrection was the only way forward. After all, the author points out that Batista, on winning the November 1954 presidential election, announced the return of constitutional rule and guaranteed a free press. Nevertheless, Castro was proved right: in Batista's second term in power, he became cruelly repressive. </p> <p>In Mexico City, Castro's brother, Ra\u00fal, introduced Fidel to Che Guevara and Gott describes this first meeting wonderfully. The two men initially got on very well. Che badly needed a political cause, while Che gave Fidel valuable insights into other revolutionary experiments around Latin America. </p> <p>Batista fled Cuba on New Year's Eve, 1958, and Castro arrived in Havana as Cuba's new leader on January 8, 1959. Gott might usefully have included at this point a remarkable quotation from a speech Fidel made on May 21 1959, in which he declared: \"Our revolution is neither capitalist nor Communist ... Capitalism sacrifices the human being; Communism, with its totalitarian conceptions, sacrifices human rights.\" </p> <p>Castro's energy was to inspire some of the greatest Latin American novelists of the 20th century, including Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez, Mario Vargas Llosa and Carlos Fuentes. He charmed not only Russian politicians like Nikita Khrushchev and African revolutionaries such as Ahmed Ben Bella, but also French intellectuals such as Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir. </p> <p>It would have been helpful for Gott to throw some light on the sources of Castro's antagonism towards the great Chilean Communist poet, Pablo Neruda, who wrote the first book of praise for the Cuban revolution, Canci\u00f3n de gesta, in 1960. Perhaps Neruda's relationship with Fidel became prickly because a poem in that book dared to remind Castro that the revolution ought to be like a bottle of wine: the work of many men, not just one. The degree of control Fidel exerted over his country's intellectuals was demonstrated in 1966, when more than 100 Cuban writers - apparently on Castro's direct orders - published an open letter in the Cuban government daily, Granma, condemning Neruda for taking part in a PEN congress in New York that year. A wounded Neruda never returned to the island. </p> <p>However, Gott is superb on Castro's political skills and on the Che-Fidel estrangement. Guevara, who saw himself as a 20th-century Don Quixote, had, in Castro's eyes, become a loose cannon, an unstable visionary. Even before Che's assassination in 1967, Fidel had been seeking an opportunity to abandon the armed struggle. (Gott was on hand himself to identify Che's body after the murder.) </p> <p>Gott explores Castro's cautious attitude to the Sandinista overthrow of the Somoza dictatorship in Nicaragua in 1979. Fascinatingly, Fidel even suggested that the Sandinistas should establish a mixed economy and a pluralistic political system. </p> <p>In some ways, Gott saves the greatest surprise until the last. He writes that he expects little change in Cuba in the years ahead, even after Fidel Castro dies, because \"Cuba has already been governed for several years by a post-Castro government ... Castro himself is now largely absent from the scene ... He remains a figure from all our yesterdays, grey-bearded but eternally youthfully, like an ageing rock star.\" This is one of the many unexpected insights which make it likely that Gott's book will remain the standard work on Cuba for many years to come.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Great Southern Land </strong> by Frank Welsh<br> 768pp, Allen Lane, <strong>\u00a325 </strong><br> </p> <p>At my school in Queensland, a venerable 19th-century institution, the study of history included \"Australia since 1788\". We found this dull, a matter largely of convict transportation, bushed and speared explorers, the squatocracy, the discovery of gold, federation, and then nothing much until two world wars and international success at sport. The \"nothing much\" was largely about emancipation, responsible government and politics. How could this compete with Greece and Rome, the hundred years' war, the Spanish armada and so on? Not that we weren't patriotic, but we were edgily aware of being provincial. We had little appetite for any serious examination of how we became the people we now were. </p> <p>In the 1930s and 40s our popular culture was American, our highbrow British; the cars we drove were Chevrolets and sometimes Studebakers and our school curricula were based on Shakespeare and the English romantics. Somehow we didn't appreciate that the pattern of our lives was sui generis Australian. My 1951 passport was marked \"An Australian citizen and a British subject\". My warrior uncles and cousins were proud of their British origins, while disliking present-day Poms. </p> <p>All this changed later in the century. Self-consciousness became the spur to a generation of historians and cultural commentators. Donald Horne's The Lucky Country and Money Made Us and Geoffrey Blainey's The Tyranny of Distance stood beside Manning Clark's Macauley-like polemics, amplifying the dozens of histories written by academics. Robert Hughes took us back to the reality of the convict system in The Fatal Shore; even Theory threaded its way through our topography with Paul Carter's The Road to Botany Bay. Self-approval and self-laceration amused us and the rest of the world in the shape of They're a Weird Mob, an analysis of Australian vernacular, and Barry Humphries's Dame Edna and Les Paterson. </p> <p>Back home we began to take our arts seriously: Patrick White, Les Murray, Peter Carey, David Malouf and Tim Winton wrote books as widely admired as Sidney Nolan's and Arthur Boyd's paintings. Our films were almost as famous as our movie actors and pop stars. Sydney made a great success of the 2000 Olympics. The story is almost as familiar here as it is at home. It is time therefore to tidy up the record with a compendious and authoritative history. Is Frank Welsh's Great Southern Land that book? </p> <p>Certainly it is direct and thorough, pursuing the whole story from the first European sightings, through Cook's discovery of the east coast in 1770 and on to the British government's despatching of the First Fleet - thence onwards (and not always upwards) to the present-day, even as far as John Howard's revival of \"White Australia\" principles with his ruthless refugee camps for asylum seekers. There is a lot to cover, and Frank Welsh's pace is deliberate, forcing the reader to sweat out nearly 600 pages stocked with facts and statistics. </p> <p>Much is made of the author's being an Englishman, which does set his book apart from the copious \"Made in Australia\" histories which preceded it. Welsh is a sincere admirer of the character of the Australian people, and he pays due tribute to the many instances where the democratic franchise was established in the colonies decades earlier than in Britain. </p> <p>But he has a clear-sighted view of how much Australia owes to the innovative colonial secretaries who guided the political development of a region so remote from London. This remoteness may have been a help to liberal-minded men such as Lord John Russell, Lord Stanley and the Duke of Newcastle. It enabled them to promote experimentation with extended voting rights in Australia, in a way which would have been resisted in Britain - and was consistently resisted among the more successful colonists themselves. The first members of the legislative councils began what is still practised today - property owners and entrepreneurs opposing any improvement of the living standards of workers, and fighting actions against them in the pioneer arbitration courts. Men like John Macarthur, who introduced merino sheep, and WC Wentworth, who proposed an Australian peerage (laughed out of court in Sydney as a programme for \"Botany Bay magnificos\" and \"a Bunyip aristocracy\") were the forerunners of today's Liberal party rightwingers who deplore the red-neck followers of Pauline Hanson's One Nation party but are happy to let them do their dirty work. </p> <p>At the opposite end of the scale, union activists, fighting for better wages and working conditions, have been at the forefront of the \"White Australia\" policy and have resisted non-white immigration, at least up until the recent premierships of Bob Hawke and Paul Keating. Even more insistently than in America, money is the determinant - there is no Australian upper class, perhaps because there doesn't need to be. </p> <p>One aspect of Welsh's history would have been very different 50 years ago. Any account of the Aborigines would have been little more than marginal gloss on the development of White Australia. In Great Southern Land it amounts to a very grim parallel text, emerging at every stage of the nation's history. Again, it was the British government which tried to protect the indigenous people, following its general principle that they were as much under the beneficence of the Crown as the settlers. As independence was achieved, the condition of the Aborigines declined. </p> <p>There isn't much about literature, painting or music; sport is confined to cricket other than a short account of the AFL (Australian rules football); surprisingly there is nothing about racing beyond deification of the horse Phar Lap; surfing and its styles go unrecorded; modern day Aussie backpackers only peep out of the text; the bankers, horn players, actors, ballet-dancers and diplomats who have penetrated every part of the globe, even the United States, are hardly to be seen. </p> <p>One welcome aspect of Welsh's fairmindedness is his scepticism about certain over-valued symbols of Australianness - notably Ned Kelly and \"Breaker\" Morant. Alas, no anathema is directed at Rupert Murdoch or Kerry Packer. It is particularly worthwhile that Welsh will not countenance the absurd slurs on British and French troops at Gallipoli to point up Anzac heroism. </p> <p>This is essentially a very thorough history of Australia's political development as an independent nation. The chief paradox Welsh emphasises is how stable the country became early on and remained during 200 years of febrile and unsettled alternation of party political government. His view is that this is one of the most peaceable societies in the world. The only internal battle in Australia, the \"Eureka stockade\" was far milder than the Peterloo or Gordon riots in Britain. The genocide of the Aborigines was piecemeal and by attrition. Even the gold rushes were not accompanied by the lawlessness and murder endemic in California in 1848. </p> <p>How may an Australian best read Welsh? I admired his general presentation but found I got most pleasure when something he recorded matched my own memory. For this reason, I was struck by his account of the collapse of the banks in the 1890s: my own great-grandfather lost everything when, after the 1893 Brisbane flood, the Queensland National Bank ceased trading. Then, under the heading of \"Strikes\", I could read of the Brisbane tram strike of 1912, and remember a photo of my father in his strike-breaking uniform as a special constable. </p> <p>Australia today is not the country I was born into. Probably it is a better place: undoubtedly it is a richer, if not quite a fairer, one. It is no longer Anglo-Celtic racially, but you will see few black faces in Sydney and Melbourne, though a great number of Asian ones. The Scots go on ruling as they have always done throughout the empire. That Australia is not a republic does not mean that it is at heart monarchical: merely pragmatic. There were good omens from the start - the surgeon Worgan of the First Fleet insisted on bringing his piano with him, and one of the most useful early convicts was transported for stealing silver from Magdalen College Oxford. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Peter Porter's latest poetry collection, Afterburner, will be published by Picador next month.</p>"
