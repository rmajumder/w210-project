  "Larger than life - he stood six foot three - Professor John Soothill, who has died aged 79, must have seemed to a sick child at London's Great Ormond Street hospital like Roald Dahl's Big Friendly Giant striding the wards. But this BFG, the Hugh Greenwood professor of immunology, had come in search of hidden enemies, a food they liked yet should not have, or a lurking virus to be cornered. <p>To the hundreds of medical students from across the world, whom he taught at Great Ormond Street from 1965 to 1985, he was at first encounter certainly not friendly, more formidable, demanding their utter attention with his booming baritone onslaught of questions and ideas. He would insist they enunciate their thesis paper with clear BBC authority - as one timorous student, later to become a friend and successor to his office, agreed: \"After all, we were the ambassadors for his department.\" Yet once they settled to his task, they came to recognise a generous, if eccentric, doctor, always sharing his flow of ideas.</p> <p>From Great Ormond Street, his pioneering work in food allergies took him across the world conference circuit. He established his theory that the onset of an allergy is due to exposure to an allergic substance at a vulnerable period when the immune system is maturing in the first six months of a baby's life.</p> <p>As well as his research and clinical work, his appetite for teaching generations of students knew few international bounds. During one of his dreaded Tuesday ward rounds during which he would bombard junior doctors with novel ideas and questions, most hung back, hoping to stay out of his firing range. On one such round, when a young South African student sneezed, he immediately diagnosed hay fever. Bolder than most, the junior doctor disagreed, reminding his professor that it was midwinter. \"'But haven't you forgotten,\" John replied, \"you were born in South Africa, where the seasons are reversed.\"</p> <p>He would invite students to parties in his Hampstead home where they would meet his friends, many of them distinguished medics; then he would encourage them to explain their work. Among past students are numbered three vice-chancellors and over 30 professors, while many of his students went on to set up departments in their home countries.</p> <p>John was the son of a medical officer of health in Norwich; his grandfather, a missionary in China, came home to become the first Oxford professor of sinology. Educated at Leys school, Cambridge - evacuated to Scotland during the war - boyhood holidays on the Norfolk Broads meant sailing. John read medicine at Christ's College Cambridge in the mid-1940s, where he took to climbing, notably around Pitlochry, his favourite Scottish challenge, perhaps to escape the bane of his life, dyslexia. He completed his medical qualifications at Guy's Hospital, and after national service, a Fulbright Scholarship took him in 1955 for a fruitful year in Chicago. </p> <p>On his return in 1956, he settled into Birmingham University's department of experimental pathology with a special interest in renal disease. Then, after nine years, his teaching and research were such that, in 1965, he was summoned to Great Ormond Street.</p> <p>Retiring in 1985 to Devon with his wife - a professional violinist - John settled into a rural routine of tending his farmhouse and two-acre garden and pursuing his lifelong love of music. His baritone voice, already the familiar of Schubert songs, now moved on to the English madrigal, and he started his own singing group.</p> <p>His boyhood love of sailing returned as he launched his dayboat from Lyme Regis and indulged in his lifelong comforts - Milton, Eliot and above all Shakespeare, large swathes of whom he was able to quote by heart. He is survived by his wife Brenda, their daughter and three sons.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> John Soothill, immunologist and paediatrician, born August 20 1925; died September 23 2004</p>",

  "Most Americans may have decided that John Kerry won the three debates against George Bush, but that does not necessarily mean they are going to vote for him, according to polls published yesterday which put the president back in the lead. <p>Updated tracking polls carried out by the Washington Post and ABC News television gave Mr Bush a lead of 50% to 46% among likely voters, with 2% for Ralph Nader - a gain for the president since last week, when the tracking polls showed the race in a dead heat. </p> <p>The shift was echoed by a brace of other polls yesterday and at the weekend. A Gallup poll put the president's lead among likely voters as high as eight points. </p> <p>It was not immediately clear why the debates, which a clear majority of Americans thought Senator Kerry had won, had not given him a more sustained boost in the polls. Some pundits suggested it might mean that floating voters do not regard fluent debating skills as essential to the presidency, or that Mr Kerry had alienated undecided viewers in the last debate by his unprompted reference to Vice-President Dick Cheney's lesbian daughter, Mary. </p> <p>Andrew Kohut, the director of the Pew Research Centre for People and the Press, said he doubted the apparent blunder made much of a difference. </p> <p>\"I don't think that sort of thing makes much of a difference in a high-stakes election like this,\" Mr Kohut said. \"I would caution there has been such up and down in the polls that it may be too soon to draw any real conclusions, but we know the country is divided over President Bush, so at this point, opinions about Kerry matter a whole lot. The question is whether Kerry measures up as an adequate replacement.\" </p> <p>The accuracy of the polls has been questioned in this tight presidential contest, particularly on the selection of likely voters. Democrats argue that strenuous \"get out the vote\" efforts will produce a record turnout of new voters not on the pollsters' radar screens. </p> <p>Ultimately, the presidential election may boil down to the organisational strength of the rival parties in mobilising supporters in a handful of swing states, particularly Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania. </p> <p>The conventional wisdom in both camps is that whoever wins at least two of those three populous battlegrounds will win, but there are up to 10 more swing states still in play which could upset that arithmetic. </p> <p>Mr Kerry received at least a little good news yesterday. In Florida, where early voting began yesterday morning, seven newspapers endorsed him, while the Tampa Tribune, which has backed almost every Republican candidate since 1952, declared its neutrality.</p>",

  "Forty-five per cent of the American electorate love George Bush; 45% loathe him. Their minds are made up, pro and con, and there is little chance of changing them. Ten per cent, more or less, remain undecided. The undecided will determine the outcome, at least of the popular vote. There may be again, as in 2000, an electoral-college misfire by which the popular-vote winner loses the White House. <p>War haunts America. Iraq and terrorism forced their way last week into the third presidential debate, ostensibly dedicated to domestic issues. There is no immunity for wartime presidents. In 1952, the unpopularity of the Korean war led President Truman to withdraw from the contest. In 1968, the Vietnam war drove President Johnson from office. The swift victory of President Bush the Elder in the first Iraq war was of small benefit when he was defeated for re-election in 1992. On the other hand, President Nixon running against George McGovern - like Senator Kerry, a decorated war hero turned into a war critic - scored a smashing triumph in 1972. </p> <p>President Bush the Younger categorically defends his launching of the second Iraq war. He has no doubt about the rightness of his course or the brilliance of his team. President Kennedy dismissed the CIA advisers who led him into the Bay of Pigs. Despite the Pentagon's build-up of Ahmad Chalabi, despite torture and Abu Ghraib, despite the incompetence of postwar planning, despite the collapse of his reasons for looking on Iraq as a clear and present danger to the US, President Bush has dismissed few senior officials. </p> <p>The recent report by Charles Duelfer, the top American arms inspector for Iraq, effectively destroyed what remains of the contention that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction. The second reason Mr Bush gave was the alleged partnership between the secular Muslim Saddam Hussein and the Muslim fundamentalist Osama bin Laden. The Bush administration put over this allegation so successfully that 42% of the American people, according to an October poll, still believe that Saddam was personally involved in 9/11. But the secretary of defence, Donald Rumsfeld, and President Bush himself admitted that they had no hard evidence of the existence of the evil partnership. </p> <p>The third reason was the liberation of the people of Iraq from a monstrous tyrant. But Paul Wolfowitz, deputy secretary of defence and long-time advocate of the war on Iraq, said that liberation by itself was \"not a reason to put American kids' lives at risk\". Two reasons having been shot down from under him, the American president is left with a reason once deemed an inadequate justification for American kids to kill or be killed. George Bush, and Tony Blair too, are unquestionably right when they say that the world is a happier place now that Saddam Hussein is behind bars. But was it worth the price of more than 1,000 American lives and heaven knows how many Iraqis? </p> <p>The second Iraq war fits into Bush the Younger's strategy of \"pre-emption\". There is deliberate confusion here. Preventive war has a bad reputation in Washington. It is not only due to imperial Japan's preventive strike at the American fleet in Pearl Harbor, but Presidents Truman and Eisenhower explicitly rejected preventive war, and those recommending preventive war against the Soviet Union were generally derided as loonies. </p> <p> So the Bush administration replaced \"preventive\" by \"pre-emptive\". The distinction between \"pre-emptive\" and \"preventive\" is worth preserving - it is the distinction between legality and illegality. \"Pre-emptive\" war refers to a direct, immediate, specific threat that must be met at once. In the words of a department of defence manual, \"an attack initiated on the basis of incontrovertible evidence that an enemy attack is imminent\". \"Preventive\" war refers to potential, future and, therefore, speculative attacks. </p> <p>\"Daniel Webster wrote a very famous defence of anticipatory self-defence,\" Condoleezza Rice, President Bush's national security adviser, informed the press. Dr Rice, the former provost of Stanford, does not know her American history. According to Secretary of State Webster's \"famous\" 1841 statement, a pre-emptive reaction could be justified only on very narrow grounds - if the prospective attack showed \"a necessity of self-defence, instant, overwhelming, leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation\". This was manifestly not the case with Iraq. It was not a pre-emptive war. It was a preventive war. </p> <p>Preventive war rests on the premise that the preventer has accurate and reliable knowledge about the evil enemy's capabilities and intentions. It rests on the assumption of the perfectibility of the intelligence process. It rests therefore not on fact, but on prophecy. Yet history outwits all our certitudes. </p> <p>This aphorism does not commend itself to the younger Bush. He is an unrepentant preventive warrior. His re-election is far from certain; but he would take re-election as an endorsement of his first term and would probably see it as a national mandate to pursue his methods and goals during a second term. Already, premonitory warnings against Iran are eerily reminiscent of those that preceded the preventive war against Iraq. He might take it as a national mandate to pursue the policy of truculent unilateralism. Already the Bush administration's contempt for \"old Europe\", the UN and international institutions is hardly concealed. Never in American history has the republic been so unpopular abroad, so mistrusted, feared, even hated. </p> <p>President Bush is a militant idealist. He proposes to use America's military, economic and cultural power to spread \"liberty\". However, there are a lot of bad guys on the planet. Is the US obliged to eliminate them all? Does the US serve as the world's judge, jury and executioner? </p> <p>As John Quincy Adams, perhaps our greatest secretary of state, said, America, while sympathising with struggling peoples, \"goes not abroad in search of monsters to destroy\". Should America seek out monsters, Adams continued, \"the fundamental maxims of her policy would insensibly change from liberty to force ... She might become the dictatress of the world: she would no longer be the ruler of her own spirit.\" </p> <p>That is the significance, for America and the world, of the American presidential election. </p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>Arthur Schlesinger was an adviser to President Kennedy.

  "Sir John Moberly, who has died aged 79, was among the foremost of the Diplomatic Service's late 20th-century Arabists. He was an exemplar of those who had no illusions about Arab shortcomings, yet recognised that many Arab causes and concerns - particularly in Palestine - were fundamentally just. His achievements owed less to natural flair than to solid hard work, meticulous application and careful analysis. <p>Moberly was the son of Sir Walter Moberly, the eminent academic. Educated at Winchester and Magdalen College, Oxford, he saw active wartime naval service and was mentioned in despatches. </p> <p>In 1950 he joined the Foreign Service and in 1952 was sent to the Middle East Centre for Arab Studies (Mecas) in Shemlan, Lebanon. There he acquired the beginnings of what became a thorough knowledge of Arabic and the intricacies of Middle Eastern politics. </p> <p>These he put to good use in early postings to Bahrain, Kuwait and Qatar, where his fluency and sincerity enabled him to get alongside younger Gulf Arabs who were later to achieve prominence in public life but whose cultivation at the time often required some deft footwork. Unfortunately, while a political agent in Doha he fell seriously ill, but his mental strength and the medical expertise of his newly married wife, Patience Proby, helped to see him through then and later. </p> <p>Assignments followed to Athens, the Foreign Office, the Canadian National Defence College and Washington before he returned to a somewhat different Mecas as director. It was a difficult time, starting with the Yom Kippur war of 1973 and ending with the onset of the Lebanese civil war in 1975, which was to signal the closure of Mecas in Shemlan, but Moberly managed to steer a steady course. </p> <p>He was then promoted to his first ambassadorship, in Amman, where he remained for four years until 1979. There was a rare chink of light on the Arab-Israeli scene, resulting from President Sadat's fateful (and for him fatal) attempt at reconciliation with Israel. Britain was on the sidelines of President Carter's controversial Camp David diplomacy, but Moberly's experience and sympathetic attitude were welcomed in official circles in both Jordan and Whitehall, where he commanded the respect of colleagues at all levels. </p> <p>He was recalled to London in 1979 as assistant under secretary of state for the Middle East, when his talents blossomed on a wider canvas. The need for them was underlined by the crises of the Islamic revolution in Iran, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and the Iran-Iraq war. Meanwhile the earlier hopeful signs of Arab-Israeli rapprochement had become one of many false dawns. </p> <p>Baghdad was Moberly's final posting, from 1982 to 1985. There he added a richly deserved KBE in 1984 to his CMG of 1976. The contrast between Jordan and Iraq, closely tied in history and, until 1958, by the two Hashemite monarchies, could now hardly have been greater. Anglo-Iraqi relations were far from easy, and President Hussein was a very different proposition for a British Ambassador than King Hussein had been. As the fortunes of the Iran-Iraq war swayed one way and then the other, western policy eventually came down on the side of supporting Saddam as the lesser of two evils. But the seeds that were then sown were reaped 10 years later with Saddam's invasion of Kuwait, and a decade after that with the American-led action against Iraq. His knowledge of the country and its history convinced Moberly that both these ventures were ill-advised. Although circumstances precluded his signing last April's letter of the 52 ex-diplomats to the Prime Minister, he was known to be in agreement with its criticisms of the government's Middle Eastern policies </p> <p>In retirement he maintained his interest in the area in commercial and charitable circles, and as a leading member of the Middle East team at Chatham House. It was a tribute to his ability that such a modest man should have become in the 1980s and 1990s something of a media celebrity as a shrewd commentator on the affairs of the region. They touched his heart as well as his head, as evidenced notably by the admirable work which Moberly and his wife did for Medical Aid for Palestinians. </p> <p>He will be remembered for his expertise tempered by humility, for his firm religious convictions and for a steely determination combined with deep compassion. In his time he climbed many mountains - physical, personal and professional - and it was these qualities which enabled him to reach the top. </p> <p>His wife, two sons and a daughter survive him. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> John Campbell Moberly, diplomat, born May 27 1925; died September 14 2004</p>",
  "Lynne Stewart has been coming to court 110 in Manhattan's federal district court almost every weekday since mid-June. As a practicing defence lawyer with a long career representing unpopular and politically radical defendants, including members of the infamous Weather Underground, she knows the building and its imposing atmosphere of jurisprudence well. <p>This time, though, her position here is different. She's in the dock as the accused. </p> <p>In late 2002, in a well-crafted display of television showmanship, attorney general John Ashcroft himself came to New York to announce the arrest of 65-year-old Stewart and her co-defendants, a Staten Island taxi driver named Mohamed Yousry and a legal aide, Ahmed Abdel Sattar, on charges of conspiracy and abetting terrorism. </p> <p>Specifically, Ashcroft's prosecutors accused Stewart of helping to pass messages from her most prominent client, the imprisoned blind Egyptian cleric Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman to his spiritual followers in the Islamic Group, an Egyptian fundamentalist group held responsible for deadly attacks on western tourists. </p> <p>To the Justice Department, the case is proof that it is fighting hard against the forces of terrorism. Abdel Rahman, after all, had been convicted of plotting to blow up Manhattan's bridges and tunnels in 1995, and inciting followers to assassinate Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and carry out the first World Trade Center bombing in 1993. The sheik, currently held in the super-max prison in Florence, Colorado is considered a special threat by the US authorities. </p> <p>Stewart represented him at trial and through his appeal process. Since his conviction he's been held in solitary confinement and has been barred from communicating with anyone but his immediate family and lawyers. The government alleged that Stewart passed the message that the sheik had withdrawn his support for a ceasefire between terrorist followers and the Egyptian government. </p> <p>Stewart does not deny that she passed the message. She called a Reuters reporter in Cairo to tell the news agency that the sheik did not support the ceasefire. The question at her trial is whether the civil rights veteran intended to aid terrorism or simply give her client the best representation she could. \"She believed it's her duty as a lawyer to stand up for the client, no matter how hated they may be and what they have done,\" her defence lawyer Michael Tigar told the jury at the start of the trial. </p> <p>Further, Stewart's colleagues point out that she is being prosecuted in an atmosphere of paranoia, and the events in question took place in May 2000 when George W Bush and his global war on terror were still in the future. </p> <p>\"The government has proven everything that Lynne Stewart acknowledges she did,\" says her friend and fellow civil rights attorney Ron Kuby. \"She did give the sheik the news of the outside world, and she did communicate his views to news media. The question that remains open is did she do it with the intent of zealously representing her client or did she do it to aid and abet terrorism? </p> <p>\"The argument she aided terrorism is untrue, malicious and wrong, but the accusation she articulated her client's views in public is completely true.\" </p> <p>In their complaint, government prosecutors called Stewart \"an indispensable and active facilitator of the terrorist communication network\", and said her actions were akin to an accomplice in a bank robbery who distracts security guards while others pinch the money. Specifically, the government says Stewart allowed Yousry to communicate with Rahman in Arabic about the ceasefire, and that she purposely made comments in English to mask the Arabic conversation. </p> <p>The evidence was obtained under a warrant that permits the authorities to secretly monitor and tape generally privileged conversations between inmates and their lawyers in terrorist cases. Whether or not Stewart's actions crossed the line of responsibility (she had specifically agreed in writing to the special rules banning the sheik from communicating with anyone but his family and lawyers), the apparent challenge to the relationship between counsel and client has implications for the practice of US criminal law. </p> <p>Prosecutors accuse her of \"calculated conduct\" in the way she abused her rights as a lawyer. For her supporters, and even for many members of the bar who may not approve of her actions, her case sends a clear warning to the legal profession: don't represent accused terrorists or any public enemy or you, too, could become a suspect. Stewart herself says her case is a test. </p> <p>\"This fight is not about the sheikh, let's get that clear,\" she said before her trial. \"This fight is about America. About whether we want to change our system of criminal justice to the extent that nobody - and probably high on that list, the left in this country - can feel secure talking to a lawyer.\" </p> <p>Indeed, the trial is infused with the misgivings that have characterised American life since 9/11. The Bush administration argues that the war on terror justifies the tightening up of civil liberties as part of what Ashcroft calls the \"paradigm of prevention\". Opponents believe that it is a pretext for government to further accrue power and control over the individual. While the case has been brought not under the controversial USA Patriot Act, but under earlier legislation that permits the US to conduct counter-intelligence on people it thinks are engaging in terrorism or secret intelligence activities, the outcome may come to define the limits of what lawyers can do. </p> <p>\"There are so many lawyers already reluctant to take on controversial cases, they will become even more reluctant,\" says Kuby. \"If something this small results in Lynne going to prison for a decade, they're not going to want to take the case.\" </p> <p>While she may not relish being imprisoned, there's no doubt Stewart recognises that she has become, in her words, the \"poster child of Ashcroft's assault on the Bill of Rights.\" Her lawyer, Michael Tigar, who has called the case \"an opportunity to confront the Bush/Cheney/Ashcroft effort to destroy human rights and scare the country into lurching to the right,\" is also a veteran of the left-leaning civil rights circuit whose clients have ranged from the family of the murdered Chilean diplomat Orlando Letelier to the Oklahoma City bomber Terry Nichols. </p> <p>So arduous has the lengthy trial proved for the jury that the judge gave them permission to take longer lunches and to eat outside because they were falling asleep, but it has produced some intriguing moments. In one wire-tapped exchange, Abdel Rahman, his Arabic interpreter Mohamed Yousry and Stewart are heard wondering if Yusuf Islam, aka Cat Stevens, could be persuaded to join the defence committee. On the tape, the sheik instructs the singer to be added to the list but no one can remember his real, pre-Muslim, name. Yousry suggests he was a Beatle. \"Oh yeah, he was the most famous,\" the sheik concurs in Arabic. </p> <p>Some see Stewart's case as typical of the kind of over-prosecution the justice department under Ashcroft has pursued in the name of domestic security. Under his predecessor, Janet Reno, the department declined the opportunity to prosecute her. </p> <p>Critics of the department say it has been singularly unsuccessful in prosecuting allegedly terrorist-related individuals and plots since 9/11. Of the 301 terrorist convictions the government claims, almost all are for giving \"material support\" and have little directly to do with terrorism. </p> <p>This weekend, a New York Times editorial endorsing John Kerry for president noted that Ashcroft has \"appeared on TV time and again to announce sensational arrests of people who turned out to be either innocent, harmless braggarts or extremely low-level sympathisers of Osama bin Laden who, while perhaps wishing to do something terrible, lacked the means.\" </p> <p>Kuby says: \"The amazing thing about the criminal justice process in America is that none of the schmucks they've been prosecuting poses any danger to anybody.\" </p> <p>The Lackawanna Six, a group of young Muslim men from upstate New York, were effectively prosecuted for sending sleeping bags to the Taliban. \"We may all want the Taliban to be cold and uncomfortable, but the notion that sending them sleeping bags earns you 15 years in prison is striking,\" Kuby says. </p> <p>\"And that is true for almost all of the terrorist prosecutions in the US since 9/11. They have been for bit-players and non-players, prosecuted for obscure and innocuous activities in most cases, none of which that would ordinarily appear on anybody's radar.\" </p> <p>Two weeks ago the case against four Muslim immigrants once accused of having foreknowledge of the 9/11 attacks abruptly collapsed in Detroit. In bringing the case, the government had relied on a single informant who prosecutors now concede told them what they wanted to hear in return for having fraud charges against him dropped. Far from being a \"sleeper operational combat cell\", the four seem to have had no links to terrorism and the government has now repudiated its own case, discredited its own witnesses and found fault with virtually every part of its prosecution. </p> <p>In charging the men, a justice department memorandum revealed, prosecutors hoped they would find out what the four were up to. \"We can charge this case with the hope that the case might get better,\" wrote counterterrorism chief Barry Sabin, \"and the certainty that it will not get much worse.\" </p> <p>But as Stewart's lawyer begins presentation of her defence this week, it is unlikely she relishes being the accused. \"It's good to vindicate causes and work to fight injustice,\" says Kuby. \"It's not necessarily desirable to be the cause that people are working to vindicate.\"</p>",

  "<p><strong>Pre-amble</strong> Rafa Benitez's team is bolstered by the return of Spanish wizard Xabi Alonso in place of Salif Diao. Will Harry Kewell start after recovering from an ankle problem? Will he make any difference if he does? Your thoughts please.</p> <p>Deportivo, who have made a pretty dreadful start to the competition all in all, are without Sergio, who's serving a one-match ban. Last season's semi-finalists have good pedigree in this competition; certainly better than Liverpool's in recent years, but Benitez's side will be favourites to take this. Of course that means there's even more pressure on them not to lose, but surely this team of travelling troubadours will respond better to a game against one of Europe's top teams than they might to a stinky cold night in Portsmouth? </p> <p>Looks like Kewell will be warming the bench, along with fellow returnee Steve Finnan. Apart from Alonso it's the same team which conjured the Fulham win out of a box marked 'not very likely' at the weekend. Cisse and Baros start up front, with Alonso and Hamann manning the midfield engine room in the absence of Steven Gerrard. </p> <p><strong>Liverpool:</strong> Kirkland, Josemi, Hyypia, Carragher, Traore, Luis Garcia, Alonso, Hamann, Riise, Baros, Cisse. Subs: Dudek, Finnan, Kewell, Diao, Sinama Pongolle, Biscan, Warnock. </p> <p><strong>D Coruna: </strong> Molina, Manuel Pablo, Cesar, Andrade, Capdevila, Victor, Mauro Silva, Duscher, Luque, Valeron, Pandiani. Subs: Munua, Romero, Tristan, Fran, Munitis, Scaloni, Pablo Amo. </p> <p><strong>Scouse stereotypes</strong> Apparently the Deportivo team have been delayed by 15 minutes due to the police having to close off an area of Liverpool because of an armed robbery. At this point we would normally make some supposedly witty, if slightly regionalist comment about cultural distinctions in certain parts of the north west. However, following recent GuardianUnlimited guideline changes, we'll just have to satisfy ourselves with a slightly snide snigger. </p> <p><strong>Matters for concern</strong> Could anyone please tell us why we have started writing this minute-by-minute as if there are more than one of us? And while we're at it, where are all your emails? Is it 'cos I is not a witty if slightly misanthropic Irishman?</p> <p>Saul in Pittsburgh asks: \"Are you not a full time employee, or does the Guardian ration e-mail addresses in some kind of 'save the planet' plan?\" You've guessed it Saul, I'm on the lower rungs of the ladder, a pikey freelancer not fit to shine the shoes of Glendenning and co. Then again if I did have a Guardian email I'd have to put up with thousands of emails from pituary retards in the US complaining about the paper's supposedly biased coverage of the US election (ie we occasionally express the sentiment that George Bush may not be a particularly nice man.) </p> <p>So it's not all bad, eh?</p> <p><strong>And they're off</strong> From a free-kick on the left Traore knocks it forward to Cisse who has a free header inside the box. It flies past the left-hand upright. </p> <p><strong>2 mins</strong> Alonso is already causing problems with some incisive passing. Liverpool get their first corner but it flies over everyones' heads and comes to nothing. Emmett Williams in New York writes: \"I have nothing clever nor interesting to write, but you should know that you are being read.\" It's good to know I have some support Emmett. By the way did I say how much I love American people? </p> <p><strong>6 mins</strong> Not a lot happening of note, but Milan Baros is looking sharp and Liverpool have plenty of possession. \"I'm with Paula Willow (see the Man. Utd coverage next door),\" says Robi Polgar, somewhat nonsensically. \"Where's grumpy Barry for our LFC trial? Who are you?\" An imposter, clearly. </p> <p><strong>9mins:</strong> Alberto Luque phaffs about on the left wing and eventually gets himself trapped in amongst two Liverpool players. The ball goes out, Luque complains and ends up with a yellow card. Some more Deportivo pressure down the left however, and things are looking more promising for the Spanish side.</p> <p><strong>12mins</strong> Alonso clips in a free kick from the right, and Cisse connects, but it's way over the bar.</p> <p><strong>13mins</strong> Cisse to Luis Garcia just inside the box but the referee's assistant raises the offside flag.</p> <p><strong>14mins</strong> A Deportivo corner and Hamann completely loses Cesar at the back post. The latter's strong header is headed off the line by Riise. A narrow escape for the home side.</p> <p><strong>23mins</strong> You've missed another good attempt by Cisse after I decided to return this report around after a few peeps complained. Thanks to Alex Hill in LA for pointing out my error.</p> <p><strong>25 mins</strong> Traore to Garcia to Baros on the right, who finds Cisse unmarked in the centre. Molina just about spoons a save. Quick sharp passing from Liverpool and its looking positive right now.</p> <p><strong> 29mins</strong> Hamann through the centre to Baros, who slaloms round Molina but is denied at the end by Manuel Pablo just as the open net awaits. The resulting corner comes to nothing and a second a few moments later is also wasted. \"Based on my theory that footballers with names ending in vowels are generally better than their consonated counterparts, we should be in for a draw,\" says Mark Brownlow in Vienna.\"But if Benitez replaces Baros and Hamann with Diao and Sinama Pongolle, Liverpool should romp to victory.\" Slightly abstract, I have to admit, but it makes a change from all the emails telling me how much better Barry Glendenning is than I am. And no Paula Willow I am not an \"intern\". Harumph!</p> <p><strong>33mins</strong> Another disappointing miss for the Reds. Garcia's strike is palmed behind by Molina and the resulting corner is wasted. Hamann gets a yellow card for a foul on Victor.</p> <p><strong>36mins</strong> An outswinging Garcia corner comes to Riise, whose fine strike hits the crowd of Deportivo players and falls to Baros near the left hand goal post. The angle is too narrow for him to find the goal, however, and Liverpool have still failed to score despite having almost a quarter of an hour of pretty solid pressure.</p> <p><strong>38mins</strong> Jorge Andrade is given a yellow card for a late tackle on Carragher. Meanwhile, Michael Owen has scored his first goal for Real Madrid against Kiev at the Bernabeu; how Liverpool may wish they could still rely on his talents.</p> <p><strong>40mins</strong> Baros through the centre hits another strike narrowly wide of the left-hand upright from just outside the box.</p> <p><strong>43mins</strong> Deportivo have a few moments or possession in Liverpool's half, but they're not getting anywhere near the goal. Liverpool are containing their counter-attacks well, if only they could finish their own forward moves.</p> <p><strong>Half-time</strong> Still goalless, but Liverpool look by far the better side. If it hadn't been for a couple of excellent saves by Molina Baros would have had a couple on the scoresheet already. He looks fresh. Cisse, meanwhile, has had his moments, but needs to learn to use his pace to beat opponents to the ball rather than risking being caught offside by trying to grab an extra yard's advantage.</p> <p>\"So what's Barry doing this evening?\" asks Richard Maxey. \"I thought he was contractually obliged to cover all Liverpool games. Does this mean there's half a chance of a decent game tonight?\" It's certainly looking that way, Richard. This is one of the most exciting scoreless games I've seen in a long while. Meanwhile, at least two or three of people have emailed in to say I'm much better than Barry. And only one of them was my mum.</p> <p><strong>46mins</strong> Welcome back, and it's Liverpool straight at it again. Cisse to Garcia, to Baros, who's offside.</p> <p><strong>49mins</strong> Baros is cynically brought down by Cesar whilst on another lively run in dangerous territory and Liverpool have a free-kick from a central position just to the left of the box. Hamann is over it, but his strike is deflected to safety off a Liverpool player for a goal kick.</p> <p><strong>53mins</strong> Luis Garcia looks like he's twisted an ankle. On the touchline Harry Kewell begins to stretch hopefully but that's all he'll be doing for a while if the Liverpool backroom staff have anything to do with it. They want Garcia back on, and no wonder. Apparently over in Spain, Ronaldo has just taken one full in the swingers. Emmett Williams wonders why European sportsmen don't wear boxes to protect themselves from such painful eventualities, when Americans are so keen on them. Ever heard of the phrase \"balls of steel\" Emmett? Besides, the birth rate over here is far too high as it is.</p> <p><strong>56mins</strong> Liverpool are knocking it around nicely from left to right, 10 yards or so back from the box. It's like watching a Reds game from yesteryear, but there's no final ball into the box at the moment, despite the pressure.</p> <p><strong>58mins</strong> Scaloni comes on for Deportivo's Brazilian captain Silva, who's injured.</p> <p><strong>61mins</strong> Valeron almost connects with a curling long pass from the left wing. Deportivo are having their occasional moments and they could still pinch on the counter. \"Do you think Liverpool can take this one? I have seen all of Depos games this season except this one and they have not been the Depo of old (5-1 thrashing by Valencia comes to mind),\" says, umm, someone who hasn't put their name on the email. I reckon so, nameless one, especially as that incredibly good buy HARRY KEWELL IS ABOUT TO COME ON! Yay!</p> <p><strong>65mins</strong> \"Well I must say Barry strangely resembles Rob Lowe!\" writes Andy Myers. Funny you should say that Andy. I believe he has been told that in the past. You'd be amazed at various sportsdesk members' similarities in looks to famous celebrities. Rob Smyth, for instance, is a dead ringer for the young Mark Hamill, he of Star Wars fame, while Georgina Turner bears an uncanny resemblance to Demi Moore. Meanwhile Cisse fluffs another chance from the right hand side of the box, and Alonso tries a Beckham from behind the half way line. The Kop is shouting his name.</p> <p><strong>72mins</strong> A draw here just isn't enough for Liverpool, but Deportivo have been a tighter unit in the second half. Unless the generally ineffective Kewell can conjure something, this is heading for stalemate, because Alonso and Garcia are looking tired.</p> <p><strong>73mins</strong> I only really said that because it's sod's law that one of them will score if I write them off, natually.</p> <p><strong>77mins</strong> Steve Finnan is on for Cisse. Garcia presumably will now push up front with Baros. Cisse is no great loss, to be frank. He's found some nice positions but looked off the pace and lacking confidence, which is little surprise given his three goals in 13 games since arriving.</p> <p><strong>78mins</strong> Alonso to Kewell on the left. The Australian cuts inside and ignores two Liverpool players to his right, choosing to go it alone. His shot to the left post is easily held by Molina.</p> <p><strong>82mins</strong> Kewell skips past a couple of players and wins a throw out on the left. He's actually looking like Liverpool's best hope of creating something effective. </p> <p><strong>85mins</strong> More Kewell mischief down the left. Liverpool have plenty of players in the box. Florent Sinama-Pongolle, on for Garcia goes down under a challenge from Capdevila inside the box but referee Anders Frisk waves away the Liverpool protests. \"I've been watching <a href=\"http://football.theguardian.com/news/matchreport/0,9752,1330841,00.html\">Smyth's commentary</a> on the MUFC game and I can confirm you are just slightly more entertaining than him,\" writes Mark in Vancouver, one of a number of Canadians who have emailed in, generally slagging off the Americans who've been emailing in. </p> <p><strong>89mins</strong> Andrade should have gone for a second bookable offence after a blatant lunge at Baros, but Frisk won't listen to Liverpool's protests.</p> <p><strong>90mins</strong> A Kewell free-kick from outside the box but the Deportivo wall is too close. Frisk moves the ball forward and a second effort from Kewell flies just wide of the left-hand upright. If that had gone in he might have been (temporarily) forgiven for everything.</p> <p><strong>93mins</strong> With Deportivo putting their feet in, Hamann has a free-kick from 30 yards out, but it's over the bar. Liverpool have done enough to win tonight, but the ball just won't go in the net for them. Baros gets a yellow card for a frustrated tackle on Pablo.</p> <p><strong>Full-time</strong> It ends scoreless and Liverpool will now need to win in Spain or at Monaco to get through the group stages; not something you'd put your money on. Nevertheless it's been an entertaining Anfield evening with the Reds looking stylish and lively. Thanks for all your emails, have a great evening. Ben. P.S. Vote Kerry!</p>",
  "<p>Taking the temperature of the more right wing blogs, you cannot help but wonder if they would rather the US was fighting its war on terror against France or Spain. The foiling this week of a suspected bomb plot in Madrid led to another round of <a href=\"http://www.captainsquartersblog.com/mt/archives/002800.php\">anti-Spanish outbursts</a>. \"Perhaps the Spanish electorate will understand now that appeasing terrorists only leads to more terrorism, a lesson that Europeans learned the hard way 60 years ago,\" writes Captain Ed on <strong>Captain's Quarters</strong>. \"Maybe this will wake the Spaniards to the dangers of withdrawal and appeasement.\"</p> <p>The background here is that Spain's conservatives lost the general election held immediately after the Madrid train bombings to the opposition socialists, who then pulled troops out of Iraq. Why the party of US ally Jos\u00e9 Maria Aznar lost is a good question. Certainly the Iraq deployment was unpopular, but there was also widespread anger that it tried to save its electoral skin by <a href=\"http://observer.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,1168989,00.html\">pinning blame for the attack on the armed Basque separatists Eta</a>. The orthodox view among the right wingers, however, is that Spain \"capitulated\" to terrorism.</p> <p>What riles is the policy shift instead of the country but the same cannot be said for France, it just riles on its own. In this context John Kerry's French relatives and command of the spoken language are something of a rallying point for Republicans - a \"Barneycam\" at the party's New York convention showed the president's dog in debate with a beret-wearing poodle sock puppet. There is therefore some surprise that the senator dared to speak French to Haitians in Florida. \"Let's see: Your opponent is characterising you as an effete internationalist willing to 'turn America's national security decisions over to international bodies or leaders of other countries',\" <a href=\"http://slate.msn.com/id/2108379/\">observes</a> Chris Suellentrop at <strong>Slate</strong>. \"In particular, he suggests, in all seriousness, that you want to call up Jacques Chirac for permission before deploying the military [\u2026] How should you defend yourself against these slanders? By speaking French on the stump, of course.\"</p> <p>If you are now fuming that a man who can speak French is vying for the leadership of the world's only superpower then take solace in <strong>No Pasar\u00e1n</strong>'s <a href=\"http://no-pasaran.blogspot.com/2004/10/operation-rooster-crow-infiltrating.html\">Operation Rooster Crow</a>. On hearing the French chapter of Democrats Abroad was to stage a rally under the Eiffel Tower it pulled on its best \"Communists for Kerry\" t-shirts and signs that read \"NO TO WAR; yes to collaboration\".

  "<p>During the closing weeks of the 2000 presidential campaign, at a campaign rally, George Bush spotted a veteran political reporter and turned to Dick Cheney, standing next to him on the platform, to remark: \"There's Adam Clymer, major league asshole from the New York Times.\" \"Oh yeah, big time,\" replied Cheney. Unbeknownst to them, their locker room exchange was caught by an open microphone. Four years later, nobody connected with the Bush-Cheney campaign appears even slightly concerned about being caught denigrating the Times; they are more than happy to do it on the record, as the White House has all but declared open warfare on the nation's leading newspaper. </p> <p>The latest volley came over the weekend when Republican campaign officials accused the Times's Sunday magazine of fabricating a provocative quote from Bush in which he bragged - behind closed doors and speaking to wealthy supporters - that he would announce plans for \"privatising of social security\" early next year, after his re-election. When Democrats jumped on the remark, dubbing it the \"January surprise\", the Republican National Committee chairman, Ed Gillespie, dismissed the Times's work as \"Kitty Kelley journalism\", insisting Bush had never uttered the phrase attributed to him. But the Times stands by the 8,300-word story by Ron Suskind, author of The Price of Loyalty: George W Bush, the White House and the Education of Paul O'Neill, a revealing account of the former secretary of the treasury published earlier this year. </p> <p>That confrontation, and the Bush campaign's harsh accusation that respected journalist Suskind and the editors of the Times are liars, come on the heels of a series of denigrations by the White House: the Times reporter was recently banned from Cheney's campaign plane; and in his acceptance speech before the Republican Convention Bush mocked the paper by distorting, out of context, one of its columnist's writings of almost 60 years ago. Early in his administration, Bush set the contentious tone when he broke with tradition by refusing to sit for an interview with the Times. He finally granted the paper a sit-down, just 30 minutes long, in August. </p> <p>\"Presidents like spin and secrets; journalists don't, so this is a relationship fraught with potential discomfort,\" says Times executive editor Bill Keller. He observes that the paper has dealt with difficult episodes with various White Houses in the past, but adds. \"I admit we're puzzled over what seems to be a more intense antipathy at this White House, especially since the campaign heated up. </p> <p>\"I can only speculate, but some of it may be that they think whacking a big newspaper with 'New York' in its name plays well with the [conservative] base. Perhaps they think if they beat up on us, we'll go soft on them. Or maybe they have decided to blame the newsroom for our opinion pages, though they certainly know that the editorial writers and columnists operate completely independent of reporters and editors.\" (On Sunday, the Times published an endorsement of Senator John Kerry, in which it commented: \"The Bush White House has always given us the worst aspects of the American right without any of the advantages. We get the radical goals but not the efficient management.\") </p> <p>The controversial quote from Suskind's story came near the end of a lengthy feature article, Faith, Certainty and the Presidency of George W Bush, which examines the extraordinary degree to which Bush and his senior aides rely on their \"faith\" and their \"gut\" to make key policy decisions, and how those who raise questions based on facts or \"reality\" are cut out of the inner circle. According to Suskind, Bush recently told a closed meeting of major contributors: \"I'm going to come out strong after my swearing in with fundamental tax reform, tort reform, privatising of social security.\" Suskind reported that the statements were relayed to him by sources present at the event. </p> <p>On Sunday the RNC sent out emails - one complete with Suskind's photo and voter registration information - that attacked him professionally and said the passages in question were \"third-hand, made-up quotes\" designed to \"scare seniors.\" But the editor of the Times magazine, Gerald Marzorati, told Salon in an email: \"Ron Suskind's reporting was carefully reported and vigorously fact-checked.\" </p> <p>If Times readers did not already know the paper's relationship with the White House was in serious disrepair, they found out on September 18. That day, Times reporter Rick Lyman wrote a front-page piece about how, despite having been assigned by the country's most influential newspaper to cover Cheney's re-election campaign, he was not welcome on Air Force Two, where 10 seats were reserved for the travelling press corps. None was available for him, or for the previous Times reporter assigned to the Cheney beat. Lyman's article, headlined Chasing Dick Cheney, was written with a slightly tongue-in-cheek tone (as much irony as the still-staid Times allows) but could not mask the strain between the paper and the White House, the kind of rift usually kept from public view as administration and news officials exchange behind-the-scene phone calls to try to patch things up. </p> <p>Cheney had already made clear this summer that he had no intentions of maintaining cordial relations with the Times when he blasted its coverage of the 9/11 commission as \"outrageous\" and \"malicious.\" </p> <p>And in August, during his convention acceptance speech just 10 blocks from the Times newsroom, Bush derided the paper, suggesting it was a fount of wrongheaded pessimism. \"In 1946, 18 months after the fall of Berlin to allied forces, a journalist wrote in the New York Times: 'Germany is ... a land in an acute stage of economic, political and moral crisis. [European] capitals are frightened. In every [military] headquarters one meets alarmed officials doing their utmost to deal with the consequences of the occupation policy that they admit has failed.' End quote. Maybe that same person is still around, writing editorials.\" </p> <p>Bush was referring to Anne O'Hare McCormick, the pioneering, Pulitzer prize-winning Times journalist. And he twisted her dispatch about Germany: in fact she was criticising the \"moral crisis\" in the British and French sectors while reporting that Americans were doing a better job of reconstruction. She also urged the US to commit more troops to the occupation. Times columnist Maureen Dowd, discussing the speech, wrote: \"Bush swift-boated her.\" </p> <p>\"It takes a certain amount of gall to criticise the New York Times in the middle of Madison Square Garden, on the paper's home turf,\" says Susan Tifft, co-author with Alex Jones of The Trust: The Private and Powerful Family Behind the New York Times.\" </p> <p>On one level the Times seems an odd choice for the White House's wrath: during the 2000 campaign, despite Bush's \"asshole\" remark, the paper's coverage of the candidate was considered to be among the most generous of any of the major dailies', particularly the work of Frank Bruni, the beat reporter who travelled extensively with the Bush campaign. In his book about that time, Ambling Into History, published in 2002, Bruni wrote that while watching the first debate from the audience, he thought Bush had done so poorly that he was sure he had lost the election. Yet Bruni never mentioned his sinking feeling to readers during his generally upbeat coverage of the Bush campaign. The Times was also very reserved in its coverage of the exposure during the final weekend of the campaign of Bush's old drink-driving arrest. </p> <p>During the period leading up to the Iraq war, the Times was instrumental in the administration's political choreography of its case that Saddam Hussein possessed weapons of mass destruction, in particular that he was producing nuclear weapons. But this year, the newspaper felt compelled to essentially apologise for what amounted to its participation in an elaborate disinformation campaign. \"The Times didn't cover itself in glory during that period,\" says Michael Massing, author of Now They Tell Us: The American Press and Iraq. \"The paper\", he says, \"was far too credulous towards the administration during the run-up to the war. The irony is the Times helped the administration's case before the war.\" </p> <p>The Bush White House's open feud with the Times represents a clear break with the tradition of most Republican presidents - including the current president's father - tolerating the major mainstream press outlets despite misgivings or unhappiness with their coverage. The days when the Times publisher Arthur \"Punch\" Sulzberger Sr travelled to the White House during the height of the Reagan administration for a cordial lunch with the president, his vice-president, George Bush Sr, and the secretary of state, George Shultz, are long gone. While President Nixon \"had no love for the New York Times ... even he felt he had to deal with them. Bush officials do not feel like they have to deal with the gatekeepers,\" says Tifft. \"They have taken advantage of cable channels and talk radio and websites that are sympathetic toward them. What they have basically done by words and deeds is to say to the New York Times: 'We don't need you. We can get our message out without you.'\" </p> <p>Bush and his campaign apparently see little political downside to a public fight with the allegedly liberal press. That very point was made in Suskind's Times magazine article, which quoted Bush political consultant Mark McKinnon as saying: \"All of you ... up and down the west coast, the east coast, a few blocks in southern Manhattan called Wall Street, let me clue you in: we don't care. You see, you're outnumbered two to one by folks in the big, wide middle of America - busy, working people who don't read the New York Times or Washington Post or The LA Times. And you know what they like? They like the way he walks and the way he points, the way he exudes confidence. They have faith in him. And when you attack him for his malaprops, his jumbled syntax, it's good for us. Because you know what those folks don't like? They don't like you!\" </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:boehlert@salon.com\">Eric Boehlert</a> is a senior writer at Salon</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> This article has been provided by Salon through a special arrangement with Guardian Newspapers Limited<br> \u00a9 Salon.com 2004<br> Visit the Salon site at <a href=\"http://www.salon.com\">salon.com</a></p>",

  "Welcome to the Wrap, Guardian Unlimited's round-up of the best of the day's papers. <p><b>IRAQ TROOP DEPLOYMENT 'WITHIN DAYS'</b></p> <p>Geoff Hoon's statement yesterday may have been pretty circumspect, but most of the papers divine from it that the government will agree to the Pentagon's request that Black Watch troops be deployed in US-controlled areas south of Baghdad. The deployment could take place within days, according to the Telegraph.</p> <p>The defence secretary said it was Britain's \"duty as an ally\" to cooperate with the US request, and the Sun backs the decision with a report on page two that appears intended to reassure doubters. Six hundred British troops currently stationed in Cyprus will \"jet in\" should violence erupt, the paper says.</p> <p>Labour backbenchers, however, were obviously unhappy. The Independent says that even pro-war MPs are drawing a \"line in the sand\", beyond which most of them will not go. The papers are equally uneasy. The FT says the proposed deployment is \"not something British forces ... should be part of\". Britain, it says, is \"buying further into a failed US strategy\". The Times speaks of the \"triangle of death\" the British troops will be entering.</p> <p>The Telegraph is not averse to the request, but says Mr Hoon was wrong to say yesterday that the final decision lay with Britain's military commanders. He \"needs to be clearer\", the paper complains.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Herald Tribune has an absorbing, although lengthy, analysis of why and how the quick victory in Iraq turned sour.</p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1330627,00.html\">Hoon faces growing Iraq revolt</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2004482157,00.html\">Sun: Troops on alert for Iraq</a><br> * <a href=\"http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/politics/story.jsp?story=573607\">Independent: Pro-war MPs draw a line in the sand</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml;sessionid=QQXJSB2FQWM3JQFIQMGCM5OAVCBQUJVC?xml=/opinion/2004/10/19/dl1902.xml&amp;sSheet=/portal/2004/10/19/ixportal.html\">Telegraph: Be fair to the Black Watch</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2004/10/18/news/war.html\">IHT: How the postwar situation in Iraq went awry</a></p> <p><b>TOMLINSON PROPOSALS 'FLAWED'</b></p> <p>Education, education, education: the Guardian devotes a double-page spread to the Tomlinson proposals for shaking up secondary education. The findings and recommendations are numerous, and are probably best summed up in the Times.</p> <p>\"Six problem areas have been identified ... the comparatively high number of children who do not continue at school beyond the age of 16; that many 13 and 14-year-olds (particularly boys) appear to become completely disengaged from education; that the very brightest students are not stretched and stimulated as they should be; a crushing level of GCSE coursework that is currently assessed externally; the complaints of employers that many students lack functional arithmetical and communication skills; and the very low standing of vocational education and qualifications. </p> <p>\"All these diverse deficiencies, Mr Tomlinson believes, can be addressed in one multistaged diploma covering every single student.\"</p> <p>No wonder, says the paper, that the education secretary, Charles Clarke, gave only a cautious welcome to the report: \"The diploma concept appears to be unwieldy.\" Numeracy, literacy and ICT will be compulsory at every level, it reports, but what about science and languages?</p> <p>The FT is even more severe. The report is a \"recipe for chaos ... the government must give it a failing grade ... It is often hard to discern what the report is recommending but, in effect, every 14-19-year-old would follow an individual learning plan. For many, this would be the current round of GCSEs and A-levels, plus an extra element of gobbledegook skills such as 'empathising' and 'resolving conflict'. For the rest, there would be core skills, plus a multiplicity of vocational courses.\"</p> <p>The Guardian, which leads with Tony Blair's insistence that A-levels will not disappear in spite of the report's recommendations, is more supportive. The paper is particularly keen on the introduction of A+ and A++ grades to identify the brightest students, and likes the idea of condensing the hundreds of vocational courses currently available into \"20 broad paths\" - \"it would end a century and a half of deeply ingrained prejudice against technical education\".</p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Education/1419education/story/0,15147,1330607,00.html\">Blair insists A-levels will stay</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Education/1419education/story/0,15147,1330448,00.html\">Much-needed reforms</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,542-1316899,00.html\">Times: Fascinating but flawed</a></p> <p><b>INCOME 'DELUSIONS' AFFECTING US POLLS</b></p> <p>He won the debates, so why is John Kerry failing to pull ahead in the polls?</p> <p>The FT blames \"widespread delusions\" among Americans about their place in the \"income pecking order\". Almost one fifth believe they are among the top 1% of earners, with another fifth believing that they one day will be. </p> <p>Despite Mr Kerry's relatively simple message - that taxes would only rise on those earning more than USD200,000 - Americans tend to mistrust the principle of taxing the very rich to benefit the poor. The rebate cheques sent out under the Bush administration have also helped them to feel that they have already benefited: \"Americans overall seem to feel that as long as they got something, it doesn't matter if other people got more,\" an economist tells the FT.</p> <p>Mr Kerry's reference to Mary Cheney's lesbianism during the third debate also seems to have harmed him. \"In Kerry's mind, he was stating a well-known fact,\" the Herald Tribune reports. \"Mary Cheney is openly gay, which her father mentioned at a rally before the Republican convention ... but to listen to conservative radio or to talk to voters since the debate, it is clear that not everyone shares Kerry's view. Even some Democrats thought either that Kerry was outing Mary Cheney or that calling someone a lesbian was a schoolyard insult and unseemly for a presidential candidate.\"</p> <p>Still, the IHT notes wryly, \"it is not as if Kerry had argued both sides of the same issue\". George Bush would not be drawn in the debate over whether he believed that being gay was a matter of choice.</p> <p>The Guardian reports on evidence of dirty tricks and efforts to expunge likely Democrat voters from the electoral roll in Florida, where Glenda Hood, who was appointed by the president's brother, is in charge of vote-counting.

  "Vladimir Putin waded into the American election campaign in support of George Bush yesterday, declaring that if the president lost, it would lead to the \"spread of terrorism\" around the world. <p>The endorsement was a significant boost for Mr Bush who has been under fire from John Kerry for failing to maintain international support for the US \"war on terror\". </p> <p>\"International terrorists have set as their goal inflicting the maximum damage to Bush, to prevent his election to a second term,\" the Russian president said at a central Asian summit in Tajikistan. </p> <p>\"If they succeed in doing that, they will celebrate a victory over America and over the entire anti-terror coalition. In that case, this would give an additional impulse to international terrorists and to their activities, and could lead to the spread of terrorism to other parts of the world.\" He added he would respect \"any choice by the American people\". </p> <p>It was by far his strongest endorsement of Mr Bush to date, and the most direct intervention in the race so far by a foreign leader. </p> <p>The endorsement came as Mr Bush regained a small but significant lead in the polls after his mediocre performance in the three debates with Mr Kerry, and on a day when he accused his rival of retreat in the war on terror, playing on memories of the September 11 2001 terror attacks in the hopes of plucking off the reliably Democratic state of New Jersey. </p> <p>New Jersey lost nearly 700 citizens when hijacked planes struck the World Trade Centre, and the president's visit to the southern parts of the state was aimed at exploiting strong fears of another attack. </p> <p>Voters in New Jersey overwhelmingly rate terror as their top election issue, providing an opening for Mr Bush to try to loosen Mr Kerry's grip on what had once been viewed as solidly Democratic terrain. </p> <p>Mr Bush hammered home his point, saying Mr Kerry's criticism of the war on Iraq showed that he could not be relied on to defend America from attack. </p> <p>\"Senator Kerry's approach would commit a response only after America is hit. That kind of September 10 attitude is no way to protect our country,\" he said. </p> <p>The president argued that Mr Kerry failed to understand the changed world after September 11, clinging to the \"mirage of security\" that prevailed in the 1990s. </p> <p>Yesterday's remarks by Mr Putin were timely for Mr Bush. Since he declared after a first meeting with Mr Putin that he had been able to look into his soul, relations between them have been close, and they have portrayed each other as allies in the war on terror. </p> <p>At a rally in West Palm Beach, Mr Kerry accused Mr Bush of \"arrogant boasting\" about doing everything right in Iraq, of diverting efforts from the war on terror and \"cavalierly, ideologically and arrogantly\" dismissing top generals. </p> <p>His running mate, John Edwards, accused Mr Bush of trying to \"con the American people into believing that he is the only one who can fight and win the war on terrorism\".</p>",
  "<p>This English jazz and contemporary classical pianist composes and teaches quietly in the west country and raises his profile rarely. Yet Alfred Brendel has called him \"an interesting and highly gifted maverick musician, and Law has deserved to have much wider public appreciation for years. </p> <p>Law has been touring with a new ensemble, Cornucopia - a mix of a jazz quartet featuring Andy Sheppard on saxophones, and a group of contemporary classical players from the London Sinfonietta under violinist Rita Manning. At the Purcell Room, Law devoted the first half to a thickly wrought single composition (Out of the Darkness) and the second to a variety of shorter, jazzier pieces that often packed an unexpectedly funky punch. Whether he had his tongue in his cheek in naming the second section Light Music (the BBC's former put-down for anything that wasn't classical) is hard to tell - but in announcing that the second half wouldn't have \"the same unremittingly lugubrious intensity\", it's likely. </p> <p>But Out of the Darkness was an ambitious piece combining rich and slowly transforming (sometimes rather Mike Gibbs-like) harmonic movements, sudden clustered ensemble sprints, and systems-music overlays of phrasing deploying bassoon, brass and strings lines against the jazz instruments. </p> <p>Fiendish drum parts never fazed Paul Clarvis, and bursts of hurtling swing travelled on Chris Laurence's bass lines, with Sheppard's flexible sax figures skidding over the top.

  "<p>After months of speculation, the government last Friday finally named Professor Sir Martin Harris as the director of the Office for Fair Access (Offa). It is an appointment calculated to keep the universities on side. Harris is not some heavyweight civil servant or tough-talking businessman; he's one of them. A former vice-chancellor of both Manchester and Essex universities, he has been chairman and vice-chairman of the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals.</p> <p>In making the appointment, Charles Clarke, the education secretary, said: \"The director of fair access may be an essential position, but I know universities are as passionate about widening participation as I am. That is why I expect there to be a healthy relationship between institutions and the director. I would consider it to be a success if the director never had to rely on his sanctioning powers during his term in office.\"</p> <p>Harris had no disagreement. \"I fully share the secretary of state's view that there should be a continuing drive to widen participation,\" he said. \"Whilst one of my key aims in this new post will be to implement a process for setting up access agreements to safeguard fair access, I hope as director to do this by working as collaboratively as possible with institutions and in doing so I will respect the secretary of state's wish not to add to their bureaucratic burden. My past experience working in the sector has led me to understand and respect institutional autonomy and it is on this basis that I look forward to working with the sector.\"</p> <p>However much both men might want to talk up Offa's importance, no one can pretend it has anything like the clout that was first envisaged. Offa started life as reassurance to the Labour rebels planning to vote against the government's higher education bill to introduce top-up fees. This was to be the guarantee that the top-rate \u00a33,000 fees would not deter students from the poorest backgrounds, by creating a watchdog to ensure universities were on-message with the widening participation agenda by signing up to a fair access plan.</p> <p>The universities - especially the Russell group - were not best pleased at any suggestions of interference with their admissions procedure, but largely chose to hold their fire to ensure that their main concern, top-up fees, survived the Commons unscathed. It turned out to be a tactically astute move. By the time the bill had been through the Lords, Offa's remit had been seriously curtailed.</p> <p>It was always likely to be thus. As one vice-chancellor said privately, \"Just look how many university chancellors are members of the Lords. They were never going to allow Offa to be too powerful.\" So it proved.</p> <p>\"It was clear by the time the bill came back to the Commons that Offa didn't amount to very much,\" says Anne Campbell, MP for Cambridge and one of the Labour rebels on fees. Campbell, and others, tried to beef up Offa by adding some claws and clauses at a late stage, but the final changes were not likely to cause the universities to lose much sleep.</p> <p>No one can say precisely how much difference the promise of a strong watchdog made to the eventual outcome of the higher education bill. As Campbell points out: \"MPs had lots of different reasons for either supporting or voting against the bill.\" But with a majority of just five at the second reading - and with significant numbers of MPs changing their mind in the last week and choosing to support the government - it's not unreasonable to suppose that Offa could have been decisive.</p> <p>\"In a sense, the Labour backbench rebels have been let down,\" says Ian Gibson, MP for Norwich North and another of the most outspoken Labour opponents of top-up fees. \"They won't make a fuss about it, though. Some were always unwilling rebels and, in any case, the nature of politics is always to move on. They're now focused on other issues, not least the next election.</p> <p>\"But the fact remains that throughout the passage of the bill, the universities have played a cagey game. And now they're back where they were at the beginning of the process: running the show.\"</p> <p>Offa was left with no control over admissions. Its powers were restricted to the control of bursaries, by preventing universities from charging the full rate of \u00a33,000 and imposing penalties of up to \u00a3500,000, if universities are not thought to be doing enough to attract poorer students through grants. However, these limited powers seemed to be undermined further last week when the new higher education minister, Kim Howells, spoke at a Universities UK conference on fair admissions.</p> <p>\"Access agreements will set out what universities plan to do to attract more applications from students from under-represented groups,\" Howells said. \"They will also set out what the university's access ambitions are, but universities will choose their own milestones. It will be up to universities themselves to decide where they want to get and by which measure. They could use the benchmarks as a measure if they want to, or they can create their own.</p> <p>\"Whatever they choose, they will not automatically be penalised by Offa for failing to reach their milestones. As long as Offa is satisfied that the milestones are stretching and ambitious, and that the university has done all it can to meet them, they will be allowed to increase fees.\"</p> <p>His conciliatory tone might owe something to the heated debate over \"benchmarks\", after the recent publication of figures from the Higher Education Statistics Agency (Hesa), which named and shamed many of the top universities for their poor performance in recruiting students from the state sector.</p> <p>This sparked a warning shot from Michael Beloff, president of Trinity College, Oxford, that focusing on improving access through targets pointed towards a devaluation of university degrees and that if the government didn't \"take its tanks off Oxford's lawns\", the university might be forced to go private. This was followed last week with further threats of privatisation from Chris Patten, Oxford's chancellor.</p> <p>No one in academia is taking Oxford's threat remotely seriously - the university gets \u00a3150m a year of public money - and the Department for Education and Skills would regard any such action as a disaster. So Howells was again at his reassuring best.</p> <p>\"There is the myth that there are some quotas that dictate how many students from lower incomes every university must accept,\" he said. \"This myth has once again reared its ugly head because of the recent publication of the Hesa performance indicators.</p> <p>\"The performance indicators do not represent quotas. They are benchmarks, a snapshot, a barometer measuring where universities are in terms of access and where they could be were all things completely equal. They get published once a year and it is up to universities to decide how to use the indicators. But the government does not force any university to meet them and does not have any other form of access quota or target.\"</p> <p>There was even better news for universities in the question session that followed. Much of the steam rising from this year's performance indicators stemmed from the change in the statistical framework that had widened the gap between the benchmarks and actual state student intake for the top universities. Howells argued he was not wedded to the new system.</p> <p>\"I am looking at the way in which these results are gathered and published at the moment,\" he said. \"I have a completely open mind about this and I'm going to look at it.\"</p> <p>This is no more than you might expect from an honest and open politician starting a new job. But it is hardly what the new head of Offa wanted to hear the day before getting his feet under the desk for the first time - benchmarks aren't quotas, and even if they were, the figures might not be the same next year; and in any case it's up to the universities to do what they think best, and if they do fall short, a penalty is far from guaranteed.</p> <p>The government has also done the new head few favours by delaying the announcement of his position until well into the autumn. \"This raises some very obvious practical problems,\" says Professor David Melville, vice-chancellor of Kent University. \"Every higher education institution needs to have agreed a five-year fair access plan by next January. It won't be easy.\" Offa will have less than a day to go through each institution's plan. Unless it is prepared to take a lot on trust and to skimp on rigour, it is hard to see how it can manage its workload.</p> <p>It is not that there is a conspiracy among the Russell group to keep state school students out of their universities. Far from it. Fair access is high up everyone's agenda these days. But there is genuine concern and confusion about the meaning of fairness and the best way to achieve it.</p> <p>\"There are 10,000 students with straight As at A-level who are rejected by Oxbridge each year,\" Melville points out. \"Few doubt that these rejected students would do just as well as those who were accepted. So what would be a fairer way of admitting them?</p> <p>\"You could argue that Oxbridge should have some kind of lottery system. But the applicants don't seem to want that. They want their chance to be discriminated against at interview.\"</p> <p>The report into a fair admissions policy by Steven Schwartz, vice-chancellor of Brunel University, which was published last month, has laid down a useful framework. Indeed, the government has accepted almost all its proposals, and has expressed particular enthusiasm for post-qualification admissions. But nobody pretends this will be an overall panacea.</p> <p>While Schwartz has been delighted with his report's reception, even he has concerns. \"The diminution in Offa's powers is particularly worrying,\" he says. \"I would have liked to have seen a much stronger watchdog.</p> <p>\"The fact remains that universities have talked about fairer admissions for the best part of 10 years, but the percentage of students from state school and manual and non-professional backgrounds has remained largely unaltered. The government and the universities are adamantly opposed to any form of social engineering, but I'm not so sure it wouldn't be a good idea.</p> <p>\"The current situation is not God-given. It has been socially engineered itself. So I don't see what harm could necessarily be done by re-engineering the process a little to even up the system and to give more people an equal chance.\"</p> <p>As Schwartz knows only too well, such measures would be electoral suicide for a government, so it is going to be down to the universities to effect change. So what price fairness? And what price Offa?</p> <p>Anne Campbell remains optimistic. \"I believe the universities are committed to fair access,\" she says. \"I have been very impressed by the efforts in this direction by the vice-chancellor of Cambridge. I also believe that Offa's mere existence will help to concentrate the minds of some universities.</p> <p>\"Running Offa will not be an easy job, and how much weight and credibility it is given will be largely determined by the person in charge. I just hope he remembers what was in parliament's mind when the post was created.\"</p>",
  "<p>On November 2, Americans can choose their 44th president, the Democratic challenger John Kerry. Of course, they may stick with the 43rd president, the Republican incumbent George Bush. The election is considered one of the most important in US history. And, thanks to the inevitable media saturation, UK schools have a golden opportunity to reflect on the election's conduct and significance.</p> <p>\"The most momentous election of our lifetimes\" - the words are Kerry's, and they invite students to share what they have picked up to date about the US elections and their significance. The last election result was mired in controversy (do students know what \"hanging chads\" were?). In addition, this is the first presidential election since the 2001 September 11 al-Qaida attacks, and only the second in recent times to be conducted while the US is heavily involved in a foreign conflict.</p> <p>The last time was 1972, when Americans were fighting in Vietnam. This time, US troops are deployed in Iraq, and the number of US personnel killed is already more than a thousand (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1299528,00.html\">www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1299528,00.html</a>).</p> <p>Ask students why having an election at such a time makes the way people vote particularly sensitive. Get them to think how a Kerry victory could affect US troops in Iraq, as well as the Iraqis and the British, given the possibility that he might seek to bring US soldiers home over the next four years. Compare this policy to that being promised by Bush: committing US forces to Iraq until things stabilise there under an elected government.</p> <p>Get students to visit Chapter 4 of Bush's Agenda for America on his official website (<a href=\"http://www.georgewbush.com/Agenda/Chapter.aspx?ID=4\">www.georgewbush.com/Agenda/Chapter.aspx?ID=4</a>) and the national security page on the Kerry site (<a href=\"http://www.johnkerry.com/issues/national_security/\">www.johnkerry.com/issues/national_security/</a>). Ask pupils to compare the initial paragraphs and pinpoint the differences - Bush's emphasis on \"threats\", \"war\" and \"American lives\", and Kerry's concern with the US acting in concert with other nations. Then ask them to decide which of the candidates' \"openings\" seems the most persuasive and most likely to make Americans feel safer.</p> <p><strong>The most powerful nation</strong></p> <p>Pupils may think they know a lot about the US, but an election lesson could start with a test of their knowledge. There are numerous facts-and-figures sites, including a helpful statistics and links section provided by the US embassy in the UK (see <a href=\"http://www.usembassy.org.uk/rcstats.html\">www.usembassy.org.uk/rcstats.html</a>). Ask students to use this and other research material to create their own quiz questions or fact packs about the US.</p> <p>What does it mean for a country to be powerful? Students could try to answer this using the data online at the CIA site (<a href=\"http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/us.html#Intro\">www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/us.html#Intro</a>).</p> <p>There is not a country in the world that is not in some way affected by US policies. A good place to send students investigating this idea might be the BBC resource at <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/3733014.stm\">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/3733014.stm</a>. Why might Iran and North Korea be interested in the US election, and why is Taiwan another potential hotspot?</p> <p>The CIA site is also a good starting point for students to investigate some of the other big problems affecting the US at the moment. Pupils can research America's environmental policies under Bush, the fact that more than one in 10 Americans lives below the poverty line, and the challenges posed by the \"baby boomer retirement\" issue.</p> <p><strong>Powers and perks</strong></p> <p>Get students to discuss the powers and perks of a US president. One tactic might be to provide them with a list based on the information online at <a href=\"http://www.fact-index.com/p/pr/president_of_the_united_states.html#Presidential%20salary%20and% 20perks\">www.fact-index.com/p/pr/</a>, or at the comprehensive presidency site <a href=\"http://ap.grolier.com/\">http://ap.grolier.com/</a>.</p> <p>Muddle the list up and invite pupils to categorise those powers that are executive, legislative or judicial, and that relate to foreign affairs. A far bigger question is whether or not a single man should have all this power. Point out that presidents can be impeached and what that means.</p> <p>Of course, presidents cannot do everything, or be expected to keep an eye on all aspects of government. Ask students to list the key areas of policy a government has to deal with, and then invite them to research who is responsible for such things as foreign policy, energy or defence in Bush's cabinet: <a href=\"http://www.usembassy.org.uk/rccabint.html#cabinet\">www.usembassy.org.uk/rccabint.html#cabinet</a>. It is another of a president's powers to appoint this cabinet, and the members of it are not drawn from elected officials, unlike the UK cabinet. Do students feel this is a good or bad thing?</p> <p>Since 2001, the president of the US has been paid a salary of $400,000 (\u00a3223,740). Most recent presidents have been rich men and have been able to draw on immense \"war chests\" to fight their election campaigns. Ask students what problems might arise from the expense of running for president in the US, particularly, the need to make pledges and deals in exchange for contributions to campaign funds.</p> <p><strong>What should the leader be like?</strong></p> <p>Ask students to come up with a personality profile for a president. Do they feel, for example, that a candidate who has been brave in battle (Kerry) deserves to win over Bush, who did not go to fight in Vietnam? Older students could investigate the Vietnam war during the 1960s and early 70s and look at how it has been a major issue during this year's presidential race.</p> <p><strong>Curriculum links and guidance</strong></p> <p><strong>This lesson is written for KS3 (age 11-14) but can be adapted for other ages.</strong></p> <p><strong>Key stage 2 (age 7-11)</strong></p> <p>George Bush - and potentially John Kerry - is just one in a long line of US presidents. Invite students to \"adopt\" a previous president and make a presentation about him, an opportunity for a piece of oral work (see <a href=\"http://www.fact-index.com/p/pr/president_of_the_united_states.html# Former%20Presidents \">www.fact-index.com/p/pr/president_of_the_united_states.html# Former%20Presidents </a>).</p> <p>Ask them to follow this up with a research exercise investigating those presidents who have held office during wars, those who have been assassinated or died in office, those who have had to resign or were impeached. Give students a list of 10 of the most famous and ask them to decide who made the biggest contribution to America while in power.</p> <p>The Republican and Democratic parties in the US are represented by an elephant and a donkey (jackass). This is a great opportunity for students to research why this might be. The exercise will require them to investigate a 19th-century artist called Thomas Nast and one of his cartoons, called The Third Term Panic, which was published in a magazine called Harper's Weekly in 1874. The odd thing about these symbols is that they were imposed on, rather than specifically chosen by, the parties concerned, unlike most political emblems: <a href=\"http://nieonline.com/cftc/pdfs/partysymbols.pdf\">http://nieonline.com/cftc/pdfs/partysymbols.pdf</a></p> <p>Younger children might like to investigate the life and times of Barnie, President Bush's dog: <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/barney/#\">www.whitehouse.gov/barney/#</a></p> <p><strong>Key stage 4 (age 14-16)</strong></p> <p>The presidential election is not the only thing Americans are to be asked to decide on November 2. All 435 places in the house of representatives and 34 places in the senate are up for grabs, too. Students could develop their understanding of the broader spectrum of the US political system by researching the powers and responsibilities of these institutions at <a href=\"http://www.house.gov/house/Educate.shtml\">www.house.gov/house/Educate.shtml</a>; <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_ States_House_of_Representatives</a>; <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate</a>.</p> <p>Elections are a boom time for photo opportunities and the ways in which presidential candidates are shown is very revealing of what is considered influential in the US. Both Kerry and Bush have extensive image galleries on their websites; as a media exercise, students could analyse these for similar themes and motifs. Bush clearly has an advantage, being able to pose with world leaders and in the White House.</p> <p>Students could also investigate the impact of the three candidate debates that occurred in September and October. Read reports of these and gather ideas about the kind of rhetorical impact that each candidate's performance had (both in terms of what they said and how they appeared physically).</p> <p>The 2004 election has been affected by its fair share of dirty tricks, and students might enjoy researching these and analysing the impact and dangers of an election so filled with propaganda.

  "The European Union is expected to tighten sanctions against Belarus after western observers said a weekend parliamentary election and referendum fell \"significantly short\" of international standards. <p>Police in Minsk last night broke up a demonstration of 1,000 people that had gathered close to the presidential palace, protesting against the referendum, which allowed the authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko to seek a third term as president. </p> <p>Protesters chanted \"the truth, the truth\" and \"Lukashenko lost\". Police beat some demonstrators and dragged them into buses, a witness said. </p> <p>Official results showed 77.3% of registered voters supported the referendum, though an independent exit poll by Gallup suggested just under half had voted for the extension. </p> <p>Western observers found evidence of police raids on campaign offices and the detention of candidates and campaign workers. </p> <p>\"We have to consider how we are going to respond to the referendum and to the elections here. We would certainly consider sanctions,\" said a senior western diplomat. He added: \"It's something we will discuss within the European Union.\" </p> <p>The EU has already placed travel bans on senior Belarussian officials following the disappearance of three opposition leaders and a journalist. The US Congress earlier this month passed the Belarus Democracy Act 2004, which calls for funding of the Belarussian opposition and economic sanctions against the state. </p> <p>At a press conference in Minsk yesterday, the Organi sation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) outlined a series of violations in the parliamentary elections, largely overshadowed by the referendum, which filled 107 of 110 seats with pro-Lukashenko candidates. Three seats are still to be filled in run-off votes. </p> <p>\"Democratic principles were largely disregarded by the authorities. Many candidates were actively excluded from registering or were deregistered, which limited the choice of voters,\" said Tone Tingsgaard, vice-president of the OSCE parliamentary assembly, which coordinated election observers. </p> <p>Former Czech president and Soviet-era dissident Vaclav Havel yesterday called Belarus \"the last European truly dictatorial regime\", citing violations of human rights and suppression of the opposition. \"We should think about some form of solidarity and support of civil society in Belarus,\" he said in Prague. </p> <p>In what is seen as one example of press intimidation in the country, the outspoken Russian journalist Pavel Sheremet was detained on Sunday night and later taken to hospital with head injuries. </p> <p>Authorities blamed the attack on skinheads, but five years ago, Sheremet was jailed and his cameraman disappeared after they filmed an unguarded section of the Belarussian-Lithuanian border. </p> <p>Sheremet, now employed by Russia's state-controlled Channel One, wrote a book highly critical of Mr Lukashenko. </p> <p>Russia's foreign ministry called on Belarussian authorities to investigate the beating, but later called the vote \"calm and transparent\". </p> <p>Belarussian opposition members told of observers prevented from entering voting stations and showed photographs of ballots marked \"za\"or \"for\" even before being handed to voters. Food was also sold at some stations at a 25% discount. The Minsk trade commission said it was tradition on the polling-day holiday but many saw it as enticing the poor to vote. </p> <p>\"Lukashenko had the task of not only winning the election but also completely crushing his opponents,\" said the opposition United Civil party chairman, Anatoly Lebedko. \"People are in a state of shock, they do not understand what has happened, but feel they have been cheated.\" </p> <p>\"This referendum has put an end to elections in Belarus. I can say that the vote was a sham,\" Bogdan Klich, head of a delegation of observers from the European parliament, told RTR television. </p> <p>Three Russian election observers were taken to hospital after two traffic accidents, one in which a bus carrying observers and Russian parliamentarians collided with a car. The car's three Belarussian passengers were killed. </p> <p>Mr Lukashenko last used a referendum in 1996 to prolong his first term to seven years, only to be re-elected to a second term in 2001.</p>",
  "The defence secretary, Geoff Hoon, yesterday faced some of the most serious backbench opposition since the invasion of Iraq when he declared Britain would be \"failing in its duty\" to an ally if it did not accede to a US request to send troops into US-controlled sectors south of Baghdad. <p>In a statement to MPs Mr Hoon effectively confirmed that British troops, in the form of the Black Watch battalion, will be deployed, revealing that a reconnaissance group in Iraq will make a final report for a decision by the chiefs of staff by the middle of this week. </p> <p>Mr Hoon nevertheless said Britain would be failing in a duty to an ally if it did not respond to the US request. He said there was a \"very clear operational justification\". </p> <p>Defence sources made clear last night that ministers had in effect already acceded to the American request in an essentially political decision, despite Mr Hoon's emphasis on the military nature of the American request. </p> <p>Mr Hoon promised MPs that the British troops will operate under British rules of engagement, but \"they will have to be less restrained if there is a direct physical threat to them. They have the flexibility and sophistication to adjust according to the threat posed to them\". </p> <p>Insisting that the troops would be engaged in a specific and confined area, he said: \"The US request is for a limited number of UK ground forces to be made available to relieve US forces to allow them in turn to participate in further operations elsewhere in Iraq, to maintain the continuing pressure on terrorists. The request does not ask for British troops to be deployed in Baghdad or Falluja.\" </p> <p>In the face of strong back bench scepticism, he insisted that the deployment was nothing to do with giving support to President George Bush ahead of the US elections, but instead to do with creating security ahead of the Iraqi elections in January. </p> <p>However, normally loyal Labour backbenchers expressed serious concern in public and private about the timing, urging the government to announce any deployment will not take place for at least a fortnight. </p> <p>Sir Gerald Kaufman, the former shadow foreign secretary, warned \"very many of us would hope that timing will take into account the possibility of UK forces risking their lives and being exploited politically in a closely fought US election\". Some Labour MPs would at the least prefer any attack on Falluja to be delayed until after the holy month of Ramadan, which started last week. However, no vote will be taken in the Commons on the redeployment. </p> <p>To Labour cheers, the former Tory chancellor Kenneth Clarke, said the government had to stress to the US \"the need to make sure that force used is proportionate to the threat that is definitely known and that action is conducted on the basis that minimises threats to civilians\". </p> <p>Defence chiefs want a firm assurance that the troops will be there for a specific and limited period, said a military source. </p> <p>The battlegroup, based on the Black Watch, will leave a large gap in the capability of British troops in Basra and its surrounding areas. \"The deployment will potentially leave us short of a reserve at a difficult time,\" said a defence official. \"We mustn't go down the road that the war is over in Basra. Of course it isn't.\"</p>",
  "Is it for the US elections or the Iraqi elections? That was the question buzzing around the Labour backbenches yesterday in the wake of defence secretary Geoff Hoon's Commons statement effectively confirming that British troops will be sent to \"backfill\" for US forces while they mount a full frontal assault on Fallujah. <p>Few in Labour's ranks doubt that the big strategic goal of coalition forces over the next two months is to create sufficient security in Iraq for credible nationwide elections to go ahead in January. </p> <p>But is there a need for a strategic assault in the main rebel town of Falluja ahead of the US elections on November 2, and does Britain need to play a supportive role in a highly dangerous area? </p> <p>Throughout yesterday's Commons statement, and the chat in the lobbies, it was hard to disentangle the usual \"white noise\" of long-term opponents of the war from a new unease in previously placid quarters of the parliamentary party. </p> <p>About 70 Labour MPs attended yesterday's statement. There will be no vote on the deployment, but the lack of support for the defence secretary must have struck No 10. The concern among whips is whether Mr Blair - in the wake of the Iraq Survey Group's non-findings a fortnight ago - is now pushing his backbenchers to some kind of tipping point. </p> <p>In the words of one former minister, the always conditional and partial support on the backbenches for the war \"is at breaking point and probably at the most important moment for the Iraqi occupation since the invasion 18 months ago.\" </p> <p>There is also deep concern in marginal seats that Mr Blair's much promised return to the domestic agenda - the big demand of the Labour polls - is repeatedly deferred by events in Iraq. </p> <p>There were clear if unscientific signs yesterday that the centre of the parliamentary Labour party is at best sceptical about the timing of the US request, even if the MPs acknowledge the supreme importance of credible elections in January inside Iraq. </p> <p>There is also anxiety, on all benches, that British troops will end up being tarred with US aggressive tactics and that one of the best regiments in the British army is about to be lured into a quagmire from which there is no definite exit. </p> <p>Sir Gerald Kaufman would probably describe himself as loyal to a fault, so he will have shaken the front bench yesterday when he suggested British forces might be \"risking their lives and being exploited politically in a closely fought US election.\" </p> <p>It is hard to underestimate the degree to which the most Blairite Labour MPs want to see George Bush defeated on November 2. </p> <p>They put that well ahead of a need to see the white flag of insurgents flying over Fallujah. Andrew Mackinlay, the voluble backbencher and member of the foreign affairs select committee, pointed out that not one Labour MP had supported the deployment. He warned: \"I beg you not to try and stretch the envelope too much, otherwise it might burst. Some of us will not stomach it.\" </p> <p>Dennis Skinner put it more directly: \"I and many others do not take kindly to the idea that we are being engaged with President Bush and the Pentagon in order to bail them out.\" </p> <p>Robin Cook, the former cabinet minister, typically voiced the heart of the doubt on the Labour backbenches by lacing his doubts with patriotism. \"It is the restraint by the British forces that has won them respect among the Iraqis. Is it really possible for them to maintain that restraint if they are redeployed to a US sector that has not been showing the same level of restraint?\" </p> <p>Another long term anti-war MP, Joan Ruddock, also claimed opposition to the new deployment had spread right across the backbenches, as British troops would be dragged into a more aggressive military style. </p> <p>She argued: \"There is a clear perception amongst Labour MPs that opposed the war and those that did not that British troops have been more intelligently and sensitively led than the US forces. Is this not the time to review the conduct of the war rather than to place British forces who have done a fantastic job in their own way under the command of US forces?\" </p> <p>One former minister, speaking on condition of anonymity, thought it inconceivable the request for troops would have emerged unless the British government was going to say yes. </p> <p>He questioned strongly the military rationale behind sending an extra 600 British troops into an area that already housed 120,000 US troops. </p> <p>After yesterday, if Britain starts taking serious casualties, and is seen to be taking its orders from a gung ho US, Mr Hoon will know he has been warned.</p>",
  "The defence secretary may have talents, but yesterday in the House of Commons he showed that acting is not one of them. Like an abject timeshare salesman making a pitch that he knows is dud, Geoff Hoon went through the motions. He claimed it remains an open question whether Britain will meet America's request for troops to assist its forces in central and northern Iraq. But the case was made in so numbingly unconvincing a way as almost to detach him from a nonsense he expected no one to believe, his dissembling being plain for all to see. Everyone who heard him will have assumed from the tone of his voice and the balance of his argument that troops will shortly be on the move and that, as a result, British involvement in Iraq will have entered a new and unsettling phase. <p>Nothing in yesterday's statement - the precursor to another later this week - explained why British troops in particular are wanted or what they will be doing. Instead Mr Hoon ducked behind his military commanders, giving the impression that the whole matter was up to them. It is not, of course. Commanders implement the orders that they are given. Mr Hoon's attempts to deny the political significance of the decision raises suspicions: not least that the deployment provides direct cover for President Bush ahead of November 2. Even if this charge is unfounded and Mr Hoon's claim that the only election he has in mind is the Iraqi one next year is accepted, the deployment has massive significance on this side of the Atlantic. Mr Hoon failed to recognise this. Describing the request as \"routine\" he claimed it was part of a \"dialogue\" that sees troop deployments \"adjusted regularly\". That is clearly nonsense. British forces will face new dangers in a new part of the country and work with forces operating under different rules of engagement and outside the remit of the international criminal court. All this deserves more than yesterday's holding remarks and retrospective notification of parliament. We are going in deeper and our government seems ashamed to say so. MPs must demand a vote.</p>",
  "<b>\u00b7</b> With Channel 4 such an entertainment enigma these days, it was illuminating to get a steer yesterday on who on earth the station is attempting to appeal to. First, Tessa Jowell revealed in an Independent interview that she was \"riveted\" by How Clean is Your House? (High praise indeed: the culture secretary's favourite movie of all time is Pretty Woman.) But it's a comment made by Adam MacDonald, daytime commissioning editor, that really clears things up. Addressing a meeting of independent programme makers at Channel 4's London offices, Adam drew on those inner reserves of charm and sensitivity that make telly people some of humanity's keepers. \"Basically,\" he explained, \"we don't want ideas aimed at old people who stink of piss.\" When we call Adam to congratulate him on such a refreshingly frank mission statement, he is unavailable for comment. But a spokeswoman wonders if the remark has been taken out of context. Could he, perhaps, actually have meant that he is sick of people pitching ideas that conform to an image of old people as stinking of piss? Mm. Because that must happen all the time! <p><b>\u00b7</b> Boris Johnson is assuming full responsibility for his Liverpool-baiting leader (although we imagine Merseyside sales of the Spectator won't exactly be altered by it), but we're keen to discover who actually wrote it at his request - if only to know who couldn't be bothered to Google any more precise a tally of the Hillsborough dead than \"over 50\". Two splendid sources point us in one direction, and yet Simon Heffer's no coward, is he? He's a copper's boy, after all. The Diary's Simon Goodley has left a message at the Heffer mansion (it's a marginally less fun version of the Hefner mansion - instead of consequence-free sex everyone rubs themselves with Daily Mail comment pieces), and we hope to quash this damaging rumour soon. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Momentarily, we mature enough to use the phrase \"Website of the Week\" non-sarcastically, and award the honour to the captivating queryletters.blogspot.com. Normal service will resume next week, but for now bravo to the anonymous Hollywood development worker who posts the best of the movie pitches - query letters, in industry parlance - that he is sent daily for consideration. And so to our first extract. \"A training accident catapults members of a female-led Special Forces Recon Team into the middle of the Civil War,\" it runs, \"where they must first destroy a secret Confederate weapon to ensure the North's victory at Gettysburg, and then figure out how to return to the present time.\" We'll be saying this a lot in the coming days, but there are no words. Other than: make this movie now. And option Una Stubbs for it. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Apologies. One more. \"When Death's helper moves in next door,\" it tempts, \"a stressed-out soccer mom finds the best friend she never had.\" </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Hilarious scenes in the Express, meanwhile, where proprietor Richard Desmond is once again pictured drumming for his supergroup the RD Superstars, this time at a charity concert at Ronnie Scott's on Sunday. Weirdly, it was only on Friday that we recalled an earlier set of similar photographs, in which Richard, 51, was pictured in a black sleeveless vest - so imagine our surprise to find him covering up in a T-shirt on Sunday. We really hope it wasn't anything we said. \"Among the guests,\" the piece reveals, \"were Harrods boss Mohamed Al Fayed, ex-political adviser Lord Bell, comic Jim Davidson ... \" It goes on, but we've no space. Let's just say that the chap who edits al-Qaida's recruiting videos must be itching for the CCTV footage. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> We are all God's children, as John Kerry rather presumptuously put it last week, so our serialisation of Sisters, Lynne Cheney's 1981 lesbian bodice-ripper, will resume tomorrow. Don't worry: dirty bits only.</p>"
