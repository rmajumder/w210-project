  "<p>Republicans love Hollywood. They say they hate it, but they don't. They love hating it. If every studio was nuked tomorrow they'd cry themselves to sleep for months. It's complicated. But nothing puts the roses in their cheeks, and nothing riles the born-again bigots quite like a splenetic rant, in Congress or on the stump, against Hollywood and all its perceived moral and spiritual degeneracy. It's all bullshit, of course: Hollywood has always been more dependable a whipping-boy than even Bill Clinton. It was here before Bubba, and it'll be around long after Bin Laden has gone. For Republicans, it's the gift that keeps on giving. The picture they paint - of a sewer-city disgorging pornography and violence, godlessness, semen and suntan lotion all over middle America's godfearing citizenry - is always a shock to the folks who actually live in what is after all the City of Angels. The metropolis the Republicans conjure up makes Sodom and Gomorrah sound like Minneapolis-St Paul.</p> <p>So, given the Republican party's marked distaste for all things Hollywood, it was something of a novelty to see a bona fide Tinseltown movie star speaking from the podium at primetime during the party's convention in September. No, not Arnold - he's not an actor any more, he's a perfect storm of empty-suit politics, vacuous celebrity and dazzling special effects - but Ron Silver, star of Reversal Of Fortune and Blue Steel. OK, so he's a character actor more than he's a movie star, but the \"Grand Old Party\" will settle for whatever Hollywood apostates it can get. And he's a registered Democrat.</p> <p>The last time Silver took an active political role was at the Democratic convention in 1992, after spending the primary season campaigning for liberal senator Bill Bradley. 9/11 changed all that, and Silver has been hot for Dubya for a couple of years now. In his speech, Silver quoted General Douglas MacArthur in approving tones (he's the one who fancied nuking North Korea, so he's hot-hot-hot right now). He also roused the Republican rabble in fine style, barking, \"We will never forgive! Never forget! Never excuse!\" provoking in the crowd the same rabid, vengeful fury one witnesses upon tossing a dog into a piranha tank. Nothing on Broadway lets you work the audience's G-spot like that.</p> <p>If you're of the opposing temperament, it might have tickled your fancy to watch Ben Affleck a month earlier at the Democratic convention in Boston - where celebs were largely kept under wraps, much as the barking, ululating Texas Talibangelical tendency would be in New York. Affleck made the rounds of the political chatshows, doing his bit, as the bumper stickers have it, to \"Lick Bush in '04\". On the loudmouth political blab-fests - CNN's Crossfire, MSNBC's Hardball with Chris Matthews - it was as if Affleck was attending some political punditry fantasy camp, and having the time of his life. He even took on toxic right-wing commentator Robert Novak (who leaked the name of CIA agent Valerie Plame) and was not bested. For that alone, we should lay off Affleck a while. At least until he does something stupid like get married again or pulls a Ron Silver.</p> <p>Just as normal American citizens are starting bar fights and keying each other's cars over Bush-Kerry, 9/11 and Iraq, so too are celebrities engaging in undignified spats and political versions of playing the dozens (\"Yo mama so far-right she...\"). It's even dividing Hollywood families. Liberal Alec Baldwin - who wimped out on his promise to leave the US if Bush won in 2000 - attended the Dems bash, as you'd expect, while his talentless brother Steven was spotted at the Republican convention by one blogger, buttonholing hapless rubes from Nowhere, Nebraska, and informing them he was \"born-again\". I hate to think what Thanksgiving dinner's going to be like in that household.</p> <p>Now that extreme patriotism and vehement political dissent are both back in fashion we're getting a clearer glimpse of who's left and who's right in Hollywood. On the left the usual suspects are brightly arrayed: Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins are a two-pronged lightning-rod for Hollywood-haters. Sean Penn, who blithely sought to broker a, well, I dunno ... method -based solution to the escalating crisis when he visited Baghdad just before the war, made a fool of himself even among his own political sympathisers, while Whoopi Goldberg earned middle America's righteous wrath by making the one joke - \"Bush = Pussy\" - that can't be uttered on network television.</p> <p>The right-wing press and websites lather themselves up into a fury over the merest utterance from Jessica Lange (\"I hate Bush; I despise him and his entire administration\"); Woody Harrelson (\"The war against terrorism is terrorism. The whole thing is just bullshit\"); Robert Altman (\"When I see the American flag flying, it's a joke\") or Sandra Bernhard (The real terrorist threats are George W Bush and his band of brown-shirted thugs\"). Larry Hagman says of Bush: \"He's leading the country towards fascism.\" If JR Ewing, venal ur-Texan oil-pimp and plutocrat, and likely role model for Darth Cheney, hates Dubya, then the Republicans may really be in trouble.</p> <p>So you'd think they'd be happy to find themselves with a few Hollywood celebs on their side. Kelsey Grammer sneered at the anti-war protesters of the spring of 2003 - which is pretty brave coming from a man who was once beaten up by his stripper girlfriend. Grammer, currently a spokesman for sufferers of irritable bowel syndrome, told one reporter that, if he ran as a \"centrist Republican\" - now there's a dying breed! - for a California Senate seat, \"I would like to rid the country of the idea that it's the rich against the poor.\" Given the Republicans' fondness for oil-slick, prole-hating billionaires, and given that Grammer made $1.6m per episode of Frasier, plus hefty syndication points, we may need more convincing on that score. Federal campaign records show that Grammer gave $2,000 to Bush-Cheney four years ago and another grand to Bush-Quayle '92. But in 1992 he also gave $1,000 to the liberal California Democrat Barbara Boxer, the very person he'd have to run against for that Senate seat. At worst, that makes him a political Janus: at best, his chequebook got duffed up by another chick.</p> <p>Grammer's ideological confreres in Hollywood are a mixed bunch. Up top are Arnie, Bruce, Kurt Russell (but not his lefty missus, Goldie Hawn), and of course Mel Gibson, whose The Passion is the right-wing counterpart to Fahrenheit 9/11 in the 2004 culture wars. James Woods has taken to slurring left-wing journos like Robert Sheer as \"communists\" and recently played Rudy Giuliani for a TV movie hagiography. Below them come the has-beens, like Bo Derek, Little Miss Entitlement Shannen Doherty, Tom Selleck, and the lightweights, like Lara Flynn Boyle and Rick Schroeder.</p> <p>By and large the Hollywood right isn't as vocal as the left. That's because there's no percentage in speaking up. For all I know, Russell, Willis and Selleck may well share all the retrograde fundamentalist sentiments of the average midwest Bush voter, but speaking out won't make them friends in flyover America. Out in the boonies, hatred for Hollywood trumps everything. Y'all may believe in the same crap as us-all here in Talahatchie, but you drink wheatgrass and mainline botox, so you must be a Tinseltown pussy.</p>",
  "In 1975 Dame Rosemary Murray, who has died aged 91, became the first woman vice-chancellor of Cambridge University, a post she held until 1977. And exactly 50 years ago this month she founded New Hall, the first new college in Cambridge for more than 80 years, as a college for women. <p>She was its tutor-in-charge from 1954 to 1964 and its founder-president from 1964 to 1981. During her Cambridge career she combined determination in the battle for equal status and opportunity for female students, with a strong sense of public service.</p> <p>Murray was surprised to be chosen to head New Hall, but in April 1954 the college was incorporated as a limited company, and she set to, with Robin Hammond, to get buildings and furniture together for its first 16 undergraduates by October that year. No wealthy founder had come forward with an endowment but she went ahead regardless. The reward for an eventual benefactor would be to choose the college name; meanwhile, she insisted, New Hall was just a temporary expedient.</p> <p>The college began its life in Silver Street - where Darwin College stands today - while she campaigned for 10 years to fund permanent buildings in Huntingdon Road. Their dramatic architecture, listed Grade 2* in 1992, still astonishes, but in her time, and still, thanks to her legacy, her college remains an unstuffy place. It was thanks to her political acumen that New Hall reached full collegiate status by 1972, despite never receiving that endowment.</p> <p>Murray was highly regarded as a university politician, which was why, two years after becoming eligible, she was elected to be the first and, until the election of Alison Richard in 2002, the only woman vice-chancellor of Cambridge (or Oxford). With typical ingenuity she devised a female version of the cassock, the traditional garb of a vice-chancellor - and last year passed on the pattern to Professor Richard. The first vice-chancellor from a 20th century college, and the first to move into the central university offices, she was said to have created her office from a corridor, bringing in her own tools and installing the locks.</p> <p>As vice-chancellor, she faced a time of inflation, declining purchasing power, pay restraint and industrial and social unrest; major building projects were almost impossible. She supported four colleges, Wolfson, Darwin, Robinson and Homerton, each at a critical stage of development; she inaugurated the clinical med- audiovisual aids unit; founded the Cambridge Society; introduced student members on university committees (New Hall being the first college in which students served on council) and built the new music school and West Road concert hall with the support of the American Friends of Cambridge University.</p> <p>Murray was the eldest of six children. Her father was an admiral; her maternal grandfather was the Oxford academic Dr Spooner. She was educated at Downe House school, Newbury, and read chemistry - and took her DPhil - at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford. She taught chemistry at London University's Royal Holloway College, from 1938 to 1941 and then at Sheffield University until 1942.</p> <p>Enlisting as a rating in the Women's Royal Navy Service she rose to become a chief officer. She was then a demonstrator in chemistry at Cambridge from 1947 until 1952 and a fellow of Girton College from 1946 to 1954.</p> <p>Until 1948, Cambridge women did not receive full degree status. The barrier was symbolically lifted when Queen Elizabeth received an honorary doctorate of law, but women's numbers were still limited to one fifth that of male students. Murray took an active part in the work of the Third Foundation for Women, an association created to improve women's opportunities. From this, her new college was born.</p> <p>With her strong sense of community, Murray spent 30 years as a JP and became the first woman deputy-lieutenant of Cambridgeshire, parading in her WRNS uniform.</p> <p>She was also a member of the Wages Council and the Armed Services Pay Review Body. Among other directorships, she was on the board of the Observer from 1981 until 1993. She received honorary degrees from British and American universities.</p> <p>In late retirement she helped children at her local middle school with reading practice. Asked by a friend what the children called her, she replied in surprise, \"Rosemary, of course!\"</p> <p>A notable plantswoman, she could turn her hand to anything, fostered by her father's early lessons in carpentry, and had a passion for small boats. She pressed fellows to join her as she weeded the gardens, and her carpentry and plumbing DIY skills were legendary.</p> <p>Almost Murray's last outing was to Chelsea Flower Show in June for the launch of the pale yellow rose that bears her name. Someone who worked with her wrote: \"She had the enviable quality of actually liking people.\" She took it for granted that women could and should work on equal terms with men, and never sought special treatment for herself or her college.</p> <p>To her, hard work was a pleasure, and no task too humble if it contributed to the general good. This message was the more persuasive because of her infectious delight in the world around her.</p> <p> <b>\u00b7 </b>Dame (Alice) Rosemary Murray, university teacher and administrator, born July 28 1913; died October 8 2004</p>",
  "It could not be clearer: 72% of the French population want John Kerry to win the US presidential election, according to a Sofres poll of 1,000 people carried out on September 28-29. The current US president is backed by only 16% of those surveyed. Of all the 10 countries taking part in today's international survey, opposition to George Bush is strongest in France. <p>This hostility runs through all sections of the population, every age group and all political sensibilities. It is stronger among younger people (82% of the 25-and-under age bracket) than among older folk (60% of the 65-and-over group). It is even more evident among those who describe themselves as close to the Socialist party or the environmentalists: 82% of this group want a Kerry victory. </p> <p>As for rightwingers, 70% of supporters of President Jacques Chirac's governing UMP party are for Kerry, as well as 74% of those who back the centre-right UDF party.</p> <p>George Bush gets terrible scores in every category surveyed except one: the supporters of Jean-Marie Le Pen's extreme right National Front party, which came second in the 2002 French presidential election. Forty per cent of those supporters declared themselves in favour of President Bush's re-election, while 50% favour John Kerry. Mr Bush is popular only among the few sectors of the French population that favour strict authority and lean towards xenophobia.</p> <p>This is also the only group that is more supportive of the US intervention in Iraq: 38% of FN supporters consider that it was the right thing to do, compared with only 18% of the total population surveyed.</p> <p>With the passing of time, the French seem to be becoming more and more critical of the war in Iraq, according to the Sofres poll. Some 77% of them now think it was unjustified, compared with 65% in a survey conducted in April 2003. </p> <p>Seventy per cent of the people questioned said that their opinion of the United States had deteriorated in the last three years. After the wave of sympathy that followed the September 11 terrorist attacks, the perception of the United States has deteriorated steadily, according to several surveys conducted in the last few years by the Pew Research Centre in Washington. The only slight boost was in May 2003, after Saddam Hussein was overthrown.</p> <p>However, Mr Bush's marked unpopularity in France does not mean that the French dislike Americans: 72% of those surveyed said they still had a high opinion of the American people. The Sofres poll clearly indicates an ability to consider issues separately and avoid succumbing to anti-Americanism. </p> <p>The French authorities have consistently stressed over the last three years that the current political disagreement with the Bush administration does not in any way affect the French people's friendship with America or their loyalty to the alliance. It is in this spirit that ceremonies to mark the 60th anniversary of the D-Day landings in Normandy were organised last June. </p> <p>This message has been heard, a little less clearly by the leftwingers (in particular the communists) than by supporters of the right. These figures could therefore change in the coming months if American voters re-elect Mr Bush on November 2. </p> <p>The French people's gratitude to the Americans is already showing signs of strain: the majority of those surveyed said that they had a \"quite favourable\" opinion of Americans but very few said they had a \"very favourable\" opinion.</p> <p>As for John Kerry, he finds favour with the French mostly because of the strong desire to get rid of Mr Bush. Some 61% said they had a good opinion of the senator; the figure is higher among supporters of the Socialists (72%) and the centrist UDF.</p> <p>Finally, an overwhelming majority of those surveyed (90%) believe it is important for France to maintain good relations with the United States. Far fewer (49%) approve of the United States' world leadership role. Again, this study shows French public opinion endorsing the political stance of its leaders. <b>\u00b7</b> Claire Tr\u00e9an is a Le Monde columnist</p>",
  "Most Australians don't like George W Bush, and their opinion of the US has deteriorated during his term as president - and we are not alone. A ten-country survey of attitudes to the US shows that Australia is right on average in its reaction to Mr Bush and his America. <p>Australians would prefer to see the Democrat alternative, John Kerry, prevail in the November 2 election by 54 per cent to 28 per cent. This is in near-perfect alignment with the average of opinion in the ten-country sample - the average is 52 per cent for Senator Kerry compared to 28 per cent for Mr Bush.</p> <p>If the citizens of these ten countries were electing the next US President, Mr Kerry would be elected by seven and only two, Israel and Russia, would re-elect Mr Bush.</p> <p>We are not anti-American. Like all of the other countries in the survey but one - Spain - most Australians say they have a positive view of Americans in general.</p> <p>About three-quarters of Australians have a favourable view of \"the Americans\", and nine in ten believe that good relations with the US are important for Australia, the poll shows.</p> <p>So most Australians, like the bulk of people surveyed in the other countries, draw a clear distinction - we have a warm attitude to Americans, and think the US relationship is important, yet take a dim view of President Bush.</p> <p>In common with other surveys, this suggests that public opinion worldwide has recoiled from Mr Bush. The US President is still the leader of the free world, yet the free world is less inclined to approve of him.</p> <p>The survey, sponsored in Australia by The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age and conducted by ACNielsen, was sponsored by a major metropolitan daily newspaper in each of the ten nations.</p> <p>In a separate exercise - three series of surveys conducted across 44 countries by the Washington-based Pew Research Centre - the turning point in world attitudes to the Bush administration was found to be the invasion of Iraq.</p> <p>Australians have an unfavourable opinion of Mr Bush in the ratio of two to one - 64 per cent compared to 32 per cent who say they have a favourable opinion of him. And this is closely in line with the average across the ten countries of 62 per cent with a negative view of Mr Bush as against 31 per cent favourably disposed towards the 43rd president.</p> <p>But, although Australians would elect Senator Kerry over Mr Bush, they are not particularly impressed with the Democrat alternative. Thirty-eight per cent of Australians have a positive view of the Democratic candidate for the presidency, John Kerry, and 25 per cent are negative on him.</p> <p>The poll included a sample of long-standing American friends as well as a traditional rival, America's neighbours as well as distant powers, across four continents.</p> <p>It included America's two continental neighbours, Canada and Mexico. It also sampled three of America's Nato allies - Britain, France and Spain - plus three other strategic allies of the US: Japan, South Korea and Israel. </p> <p>The traditional rival, Russia, is, however, a recent friend of America's, but is embracing it with the zeal of a convert. The Russians surveyed were more likely to have a positive view of Americans than those in any other country.</p> <p>The opinion toward the US of 54 per cent of Australians has worsened over \"the past two or three years\" according to poll of 1,417 Australians surveyed, while it has improved for only 28 per cent.</p> <p>This is closely aligned with the ten-country average of 56 per cent with a dimmer view of the US compared to 20 per cent with a brighter opinion.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Peter Hartcher is International Editor, The Sydney Morning Herald</p>",
  "A court in Zimbabwe today found the country's opposition leader, Morgan Tsvangirai, not guilty of treason charges that his party maintained were a government attempt to frame him. <p>Members of the opposition cheered and clapped after Judge Paddington Garwe acquitted Mr Tsvangirai in a long-awaited judgement at Harare's high court. </p> <p>The state had accused Mr Tsvangirai, who is the leader of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), of plotting to kill the president, Robert Mugabe. The charges were based on a grainy four and a half hour video, recorded by hidden cameras, of a meeting between Mr Tsvangirai and the Canadian-based political consultant Ari Ben Menashe in Montreal on December 4 2001. </p> <p>During a year-long trial that ended on February 26, Mr Tsvangirai's defence lawyers said the tape had been doctored to implicate him in a plot to murder Mr Mugabe and stage a military coup to seize power. </p> <p>Mr Tsvangirai denied involvement in any such plot, and said he had mentioned the \"elimination\" of Mr Mugabe during the discussions in reference only to the president's possible defeat in the 2002 presidential election. </p> <p>\"This was a political trial so it had all the dimensions of political influence, so it was a bit unpredictable,\" Mr Tsvangirai told the BBC after hearing the verdict. \"I was always hoping for the best but always prepared for the worst, so it is a surprise.\"</p> <p>The lengthy trial hampered Mr Tsvangirai's ability to lead an effective political opposition, and he still faces another treason charge for allegedly advocating the violent ousting of Mr Mugabe. Amnesty International said today it believed Mr Mugabe's government had trumped up the charges as a form of harassment of the political opposition in Zimbabwe.</p> <p>\"The acquittal is a huge blow to the forces of tyranny,\" said Gibson Sibanda, the vice-president of the MDC. \"The ruling sends out a message of hope to all those struggling for freedom and democracy both inside and outside Zimbabwe.\" </p> <p>He said the treason charge and unrelenting campaign of violence and intimidation demonstrated the level of panic within the ruling party, which tolerates no threat to its power. </p> <p>The home affairs minister, Kembo Mohadi, said police reinforcements were deployed outside the courthouse to prevent any unrest. Mr Mohadi added that security and court officials had also restricted access to the court, with large crowds anticipated. </p> <p>Testimony in the nation's longest trial covered a broad sweep, ranging from the secretly recorded meeting to an alleged plan by the former US president Bill Clinton - to be bankrolled by the Jewish community in the US - to persuade Mr Mugabe to leave office. </p> <p>Mr Menashe claimed he had been asked by the Clinton administration to negotiate a deal for Mr Mugabe's retirement. </p> <p>State prosecutors withdrew allegations made earlier in the trial that Mr Tsvangirai had spoken with Mr Menashe about the \"murder\" and \"assassination\" of Mr Mugabe after the words could not be found on the secretly recorded tape. </p> <p>Defence attorney George Bizos, a South African human rights lawyer, had submitted evidence that Mr Menashe was already working for the Zimbabwean government's security agency on an operation to discredit the burgeoning opposition when Mr Tsvangirai visited him in Montreal. </p> <p>He said Mr Tsvangirai had only sought the consultant's help to raise funds and canvass for support for the opposition in the US and Canada. The video of their meeting was out of focus and barely audible. </p> <p>Mr Tsvangirai, who was freed on bail, had to surrender his passport after being charged two weeks before he ran against Mr Mugabe in the March 2002 election. He narrowly lost the vote, which independent observers said had been rigged, and his political activities were sharply curtailed by his lengthy appearances in the dock. </p> <p>Mr Menashe, 52, who claims to have been a former Israeli intelligence agent and a security adviser to the Israeli prime minister, was in 1990 acquitted by a US federal jury of charges that he illegally arranged a deal to sell US-made military cargo planes to Iran in exchange for the release of four US hostages in the Middle East. </p> <p>Israel denied he was connected to intelligence work, but said he had served for a brief period as a junior clerk in its civil service. </p> <p>Mr Tsvangirai's defence team said Mr Menashe had frequently lied under oath while giving his evidence in order to cover up his efforts, for the Zimbabwe Central Intelligence Organisation, to entrap the opposition leader. Evidence given in the trial showed he had received $650,000 (\u00a3361,000) from the Zimbabwe intelligence service. </p> <p>The chief state prosecutor, Bharat Patel, asking for a conviction at the conclusion of the trial in February, said there was still enough evidence to prove that Mr Tsvangirai had planned Mr Mugabe's assassination.</p>",
  "The Democratic challenger, John Kerry, emerged yesterday from the third and final televised debate with enhanced credentials, as he and George Bush moved into the last phase of the campaign. <p>Polls taken shortly after Wednesday night's debate in Arizona between Mr Kerry and President Bush gave the challenger the spoils for the third successive time. But an ABC poll last night put overall ratings level at 48% each. </p> <p>The Bush camp sought to wrest back the initiative. In a campaign stop in Nevada yesterday, the president attacked the Democrats' interventionist promises, as Dick Cheney, the vice-president, rebuked Mr Kerry for mentioning his daughter Mary Cheney, a lesbian, during a debate discussion on gay rights. </p> <p>\"You saw a man who will do and say anything to get elected, and I am not just speaking as a father here, although I am a pretty angry father,\" said Mr Cheney yesterday. </p> <p>Mr Kerry mentioned Mr Cheney's daughter during the debate when asked whether being gay was a choice. </p> <p>\"We're all God's children,\" he said. \"And I think if you were to talk to Dick Cheney's daughter, who is a lesbian, she would tell you that she's being who she was, who she was born as.\" </p> <p>Lynne Cheney, the vice-president's wife, accused Mr Kerry of playing politics with her family and denounced his response as a \"cheap and tawdry political trick\". </p> <p>\"This is not a good man,\" she told a post-debate rally. </p> <p>Nonetheless, Mr Kerry came out of the televised showdown with the upper hand. A CNN poll of 500 voters immediately afterwards showed a 52% to 39% split in favour of Mr Kerry. A CBS poll gave the challenger a 39% to 25% advantage. </p> <p>\"This was the knockout punch,\" said Terry McAuliffe, a Kerry adviser. \"The swing voters are not going to move until after the four debates. I think now you are going to see a huge movement.\" </p> <p>But the Bush camp said it had always expected a tight race. \"The president was confident, Senator Kerry was dour and defensive,\" said Ken Mehlman, the Bush campaign manager. \"It's going to be hard for anyone to have a big lead in the polls.\" </p> <p>As expected, Mr Bush painted his opponent as a tax-and-spend liberal who was out of touch with the American people. </p> <p>On the eve of the first debate Mr Bush held an 11% lead but yesterday, with just 19 days until polling day on November 2, that lead had evaporated. </p> <p>The 90-minute final debate, in which the candidates answered questions from a moderator, followed a pattern: Mr Bush talked in terms of big ideals, Mr Kerry tried to nail the incumbent on his record. </p> <p>Mr Bush attempted to engage the audience with jokes which fell flat in the formal setting and steered clear of discussing specifics and his record. </p> <p>Mr Kerry tried to erase his reputation as a wordy policy wonk by looking at the camera to deliver firm, short answers, but old habits tripped him up at times, particularly during an extended answer on the outsourcing of US jobs overseas. </p> <p>As with every debate, a moment arrived when the two men were given an opportunity to show their human sides. </p> <p>Asked by the moderator, the CBS news presenter Bob Schieffer, what they had learned from the strong women in their families, Mr Bush, referring to criticisms of his performance in the first debate, said: \"To listen to them. To stand up straight and not scowl.\" </p> <p>The comments drew the first laughter of the evening. </p> <p>Mr Kerry responded to the same question by talking about his mother. But he also showed a self-deprecating side. \"I guess the president and you and I are three examples of lucky people who married up,\" he said to Mr Schieffer. </p> <p>\"And,\" he added, in reference to his marriage to the heiress to the Heinz fortune, \"some would say maybe me more so than others.\" </p> <p>A question about federal spending and deficits yielded one of the sharpest exchanges. </p> <p>\"You know, there's a mainstream in American politics, and you sit right on the far left bank,\" Mr Bush said, accusing his opponent of voting to exceed budget ceilings 277 times. </p> <p>\"Being lectured by the president on fiscal responsibility is a little bit like Tony Soprano talking to me about law and order in this country,\" Mr Kerry responded, referring to the TV mafia boss. \"This president has taken a $5.6 trillion surplus and turned it into deficits as far as the eye can see.\" </p> <p>Domestic issues, ranging from healthcare to the debt burden to social security reform, dominated the evening. </p> <p>The answers to a question about abortion rights gave perhaps the clearest indication that the two candidates do offer different visions for the US. </p> <p>Asked whether he would like to overturn Roe v Wade, the supreme court decision that established the legal right to abortion, Mr Bush answered: \"I will not have a litmus test. I will pick judges who will interpret the constitution, but I'll have no litmus test.\" </p> <p>Mr Kerry said\"the right of choice is a constitutional right. So I don't intend to see it undone _ Clearly the president wants to leave it in ambivalence or intends to undo it.\" </p> <p>In his most eloquent passage of the evening, Mr Bush said: \"Prayer and religion sustain me. </p> <p>\"I receive calmness in the storms of the presidency. But when I make decisions, I stand on principle, and the principles are derived from who I am.\" </p> <p>Mr Kerry replied: \"Frankly, I think we have a lot more loving of our neighbour to do in this country and on this planet.\"</p>",
  "Welcome to the Wrap, Guardian Unlimited's round-up of the best of the day's papers. <p>Also in today's Wrap: Frogs in danger of extinction, bombers strike inside Baghdad's Green Zone, and Manchester United takeover bid falls through</p> <p><b>WORLD WANTS A KERRY VICTORY</b></p> <p>A poll of the populations of 10 countries in today's Guardian finds, by and large, that they do not like George Bush very much and would like to see him replaced as the US president by John Kerry.</p> <p>Of the 10 countries, majorities in Canada, Mexico, France, Britain, Spain, Japan, South Korea and Australia support the Democratic party challenger. The reverse is true only in Russia and Israel.</p> <p>US voters may not be as far out of step with those in many of the countries closest to America as the poll suggests. As reports of the final presidential debate in today's papers reveal, the election is on a knife-edge - Mr Kerry stands as much chance of spending the next four years in the White House as Mr Bush if the race's dynamics remain unchanged. </p> <p>\"[But] no one is underestimating the Bush campaign's capacity to change the subject - by playing up fears of another terrorist attack, say - or launching a last-minute volley of personal attacks similar to those that sank Governor Ann Richards of Texas in 1994 or Senator John McCain in the Republican primaries of 2000,\" the Independent warns.</p> <p>Still, capitals across the globe are having to take the prospect of a Kerry victory seriously. A Financial Times comment piece paints a picture of an international community in which \"diplomatic lines from Washington to national capitals from Beijing to Brussels will hum with speculation about whether we should expect a tremor or an earthquake [...] America's friends and enemies are frantically poring over every line of John Kerry's policy pronouncements\".</p> <p>The piece's author, Philip Stephens, argues there is more \"unease than certainty\" about what to expect from either Mr Bush or Mr Kerry, and the mood is no more acute than it is in Europe. The postwar alliance between Europe and the US is no longer working, he says, and it will take an effort from both sides to repair it. \"The views of Europe's leaders mirror that of their voters: they want Mr Kerry to win. But what then?\" he asks.</p> <p>Luckily, Tony Blair has an answer - sort of. The Telegraph report on his speech to the European centre-left meeting in Budapest leads on his vision of an EU-US \"common agenda\" to solve the world's problems.

  "US demands on the Nato alliance are growing more onerous as the American military struggles to meet global commitments. And Nato, which lost an evil empire and failed to find a role, is feeling the strain. <p>This week's US proposal to integrate Nato's peacekeepers in Afghanistan with US combat troops fighting the \"war on terror\" there is a case in point. </p> <p>Germany and France, which jointly lead the 9,000-strong International Security and Assistance Force in Kabul, rejected the idea. They do not want their soldiers under US command. And they suspect the US would use a merger as cover for troop withdrawals. </p> <p>But as usual with its Nato initiatives, the US expects to get its way. Undaunted, US ambassador Nicholas Burns said he wants a blueprint on the table by next February. </p> <p>The US is also pressing Nato to do more in Iraq. Most members of the 26-nation alliance are already involved in one way or another. But a formal Nato role is a different matter. </p> <p>After bitter wrangling, a modest Nato training mission to Baghdad has been agreed, beginning this winter. But the Americans want more - and fast. At last June's Nato summit in Istanbul, President George Bush urged the alliance to take on a much bigger role </p> <p>Tony Blair said at the time that Nato, confined historically to the European sphere, must be ready to rise to \"new challenges and threats beyond its borders\". Mr Burns goes further: \"Nato must be present on the front lines of the war on terrorism\". </p> <p>The Democratic presidential candidate, John Kerry, also wants an expanded international military presence in Iraq. </p> <p>But whether he or Mr Bush occupies the White House, a basic problem remains: how to reconcile America's ever more importunate demands for Nato military backing with a highly political US global agenda which many European members view with deep misgivings. </p> <p>Despite the end of the cold war, September 11 and the \"war on terror\", the US vision for Nato has not fundamentally changed since Soviet times. Europeans see themselves as partners. The Bush administration sees them as followers - or else, renegades. </p> <p>Immediately after 9/11, Mr Bush snubbed Nato's offer to help. Now the US has realised that it badly needs Nato's assistance (and likewise that of the UN). </p> <p>But its effort to involve both organisations more deeply in Afghanistan and Iraq is \"as much an act of desperation as anything else to rescue a failing venture\", Brent Scowcroft, George Bush Snr's national security adviser, told the Financial Times. </p> <p>The stresses on Nato do not stop there. US pressure to increase deployable troop numbers, spending and capabilities is unremitting. Nato's 18,000-strong mission in Kosovo is meanwhile held hostage to a stalemated political process. Elections next week in the breakaway Serbian province could be a catalyst for renewed violence. </p> <p>The scheduled December handover to EU peacekeepers in Bosnia, while promising some respite for Nato, is also a reminder of the competing claims on manpower and resources represented by Europe's advancing military ambitions. </p> <p>Nato announced in Romania this week that its 17,500- strong response force, another US-initiated project, is now operational. The EU is simultaneously building its own 14,000-strong rapid reaction force, part of an EU \"army\" mustering 60,000 troops by 2007. But some of these soldiers are being counted twice or even three times. </p> <p>Nato's headaches arise not just from US pressure but also from US weakness. The US military, with 140,000 troops in Iraq alone, is seriously over-committed worldwide. </p> <p>A Pentagon panel recently warned that a big increase in total forces was essential unless the number and aims of US war-fighting and stabilisation missions were reduced. Mr Kerry says 40,000 more soldiers are needed. </p> <p>In Iraq, half the US forces are National Guard or reservists, not regular troops; tours of duty have been extended, leading to difficulties in recruiting and re-enlistment. Morale has suffered. </p> <p>Recently announced US base closures in Germany are not nearly enough. And planned troop withdrawals from South Korea have in any case been postponed because of worries about the North. </p> <p>This military overstretch is generating intense political, financial and electoral pressures within the US. Hence the relentless push for the Nato allies to do more - whether they want to or not.</p>",
  "Millions of Americans are scratching their heads over how to vote on November 2 after the last of the three televised presidential debates left George Bush and John Kerry neck and neck over jobs, education, health care and taxes, with little mention of Iraq or 9/11. But the rest of the world, according to a poll we and several other newspapers publish today, has already made up its mind, backing the Democratic challenger by a margin of two to one. <p>Any sample, of course, is just a sample, but this survey of public opinion in 10 countries does include the US's two immediate neighbours, Canada and Mexico, as well as Israel and Russia, Washington's close allies in the \"war on terror\", and Britain, still its most loyal transatlantic friend, despite widespread criticism of Tony Blair. Unfortunately, Muslim countries are absent, though their inclusion would have made even gloomier reading for the White House. A recent Pew Research Centre poll, for example, showed just 7% of Pakistanis approve of Mr Bush, while 65% have a favourable opinion of Osama bin Laden. </p> <p>These findings - likely to achieve a high degree of exposure because they are media-driven - confirm previous polls in underlining the degree of global hostility to President Bush and the Iraq war. Some 74% of Germans, according to GlobeScan, want to see Mr Kerry win the election. A June poll conducted by the German Marshall Fund found that 76% of respondents in nine European countries disapproved of Mr Bush's handling of international affairs, up significantly from a survey in 2002. It also found that 80% of Europeans polled - compared with half of Americans - said Iraq was not worth the human and financial cost. In Europe, only Poles would rather see Mr Bush back in the Oval office. Elsewhere in \"new Europe\" there is a distinctly \"old European\" wish to see the Massachusetts senator win. Further afield, Israelis are the only people to back the incumbent and to see American democracy as a model for other countries. Similarly positive views in Russia appear to reflect the hardline US view on Chechen terrorism: the survey was carried out in the aftermath of the Beslan school massacre. </p> <p>Against this bleak background, the good news is that there is a clear distinction between anti-Americanism and criticism of US policies. No less than 68% of all those polled - with the French, Mr Kerry's most fervent backers, scoring a surprising above-average 72% - have a favourable view of Americans but are implacably opposed to the US government. Opinions of the US have worsened for 57% over the past three years. </p> <p>Strikingly, though, political differences may now be casting shadows in other areas. Young Britons, avid consumers of Big Macs, Starbucks and Friends, are now hostile to American culture on a scale traditionally associated with the French. Canada, Mexico and South Korea feel even more threatened. It is common ground that Iraq and the Guant\u00e1namo Bay and Abu Ghraib scandals have eroded the sympathy generated by the 2001 terrorist attacks. Encouragingly for whoever does win, 90% believe it is important to maintain good relations with the US. The danger is, perhaps, of expecting too much from a Kerry victory. </p> <p>Mr Bush may well wish to exploit this hostility, against a rival he has portrayed as caring too much for allies and not enough for America. Clearly, if the world had a vote, the result on November 2 would not be in doubt. The president is unlikely to be surprised that the Guardian, Asahi Shimbun, Le Monde or El Pais believe that Iraq is a \"deadly and highly questionable war\". That though, is the view of the Lone Star Iconoclast, published in his home town of Crawford, Texas. It matters a lot what others think about the US. But it is only Americans who can choose their own leader.</p>",
  "George Bush has squandered a wealth of sympathy around the world towards America since September 11 with public opinion in 10 leading countries - including some of its closest allies - growing more hostile to the United States while he has been in office. <p>According to a survey, voters in eight out of the 10 countries, including Britain, want to see the Democrat challenger, John Kerry, defeat President Bush in next month's US presidential election.</p> <p>The poll, conducted by 10 of the world's leading newspapers, including France's Le Monde, Japan's Asahi Shimbun, Canada's La Presse, the Sydney Morning Herald and the Guardian, also shows that on balance world opinion does not believe that the war in Iraq has made a positive contribution to the fight against terror.</p> <p>The results show that in Australia, Britain, Canada, France, Japan, Spain and South Korea a majority of voters share a rejection of the Iraq invasion, contempt for the Bush administration, a growing hostility to the US and a not-too-strong endorsement of Mr Kerry. But they all make a clear distinction between this kind of anti-Americanism and expressing a dislike of American people. On average 68% of those polled say they have a favourable opinion of Americans.</p> <p>The 10-country poll suggests that rarely has an American administration faced such isolation and lack of public support amongst its closest allies.</p> <p>The only exceptions to this trend are the Israelis - who back Bush 2-1 over Kerry and see the US as their security umbrella - and the Russians who, despite their traditional anti-Americanism, recorded unexpectedly favourable attitudes towards the US in the survey conducted in the immediate aftermath of the Beslan tragedy.</p> <p>The UK results of the poll conducted by ICM research for the Guardian reveal a growing disillusionment with the US amongst the British public, fuelled by a strong personal antipathy towards Mr Bush.</p> <p>The ICM survey shows that if the British had a vote in the US presidential elections on November 2 they would vote 50% for Kerry and only 22% for Bush.</p> <p>Sixty per cent of British voters say they don't like Bush, rising to a startling 77% among those under 25.</p> <p>The rejection of Mr Bush is strongest in France where 72% say they would back Mr Kerry but it is also very strong in traditionally very pro-American South Korea, where fears of a pre-emptive US strike against North Korea have translated into 68% support for Mr Kerry.</p> <p>In Britain the growth in anti-Americanism is not so marked as in France, Japan, Canada, South Korea or Spain where more than 60% say their view of the United States has deteriorated since September 11. But a sizeable and emerging minority - 45% - of British voters say their image of the US has got worse in the past three years and only 15% say it has improved.</p> <p>There is a widespread agreement that America will remain the world's largest economic power.</p> <p>This is underlined by the 73% of British voters who say that the US now wields an excessive influence on international affairs, a situation that 67% see as continuing for the foreseeable future.</p> <p>A majority in Britain also believe that US democracy is no longer a model for others.</p> <p>But perhaps a more startling finding from the Guardian/ICM poll is that a majority of British voters - 51% - say that they believe that American culture is threatening our own culture.</p> <p>This is a fear shared by the Canadians, Mexicans and South Koreans, but it is more usually associated with the French than the British. Perhaps the endless television reruns of Friends and the Simpsons are beginning to take their toll.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> ICM interviewed a random sample of 1,008 adults aged 18 and over by telephone between September 22-23 2004.

  "There is a growing strain of hostility towards the United States among British voters, fuelled by a strong personal antipathy towards President George Bush, according to a special Guardian/ICM poll. <p>It is so strong that Britons would back the Democrat challenger John Kerry against Mr Bush by a margin of more than two to one if they had a vote in next month's presidential election. More than 60% of voters say they do not like Mr Bush, a hostility which peaks at 77% among those under 25.</p> <p>It appears to be personal because the public draws a sharp distinction between its view of the United States' political leadership and Americans in general. The British are quite clear that they still like Americans as a people; only 21% say they do not like them.</p> <p>But the apparent strength of the claimed \"special relationship\" between Tony Blair and George Bush seems to contain little domestic dividend for the prime minister. Only one in four British voters say they have a favourable opinion of the American president.</p> <p>The latest polling evidence on British attitudes to the Iraq war shows a nation still split over the decision to invade but with the balance tilting by 46% to 40% towards an anti-war position. This survey also shows mixed views on whether the continuing war in Iraq being waged by the United States and its allies is contributing to the fight against terrorism around the world. A simple majority - 51% - say they believe it does but the country is divided, with 40% arguing either that the contribution is small or nothing at all.</p> <p>The ICM survey on attitudes towards the US reveals that underneath this polarised debate lies a strong anti-American streak in the British consciousness. British public opinion has never been as strongly Atlanticist as its politicians, particularly among the post-1968 generation, but this poll reveals that the hostility has grown sharply since September 11 and particularly among the young.</p> <p>The poll shows that 45% believe that their view of the United States has deteriorated in the last two or three years and only 15% say it has improved. This is reinforced by the overwhelming majority - 75% - who say they agree with the statement that \"the US wields excessive influence on international affairs\". For many, that influence looks set to continue or even grow as 67% of British voters said they disagree with the statement that \"the United States is a declining empire\".</p> <p>A majority of British voters now say they disagree with the idea that American democracy remains a model to other nations - and that from a country which still retains a monarchy and does not have a written constitution.</p> <p>An even more recent development is the growth in those who say they agree with the statement that \"American culture threatens our own culture\". This is a sentiment which the British more associate with the French but despite the success of American TV shows, rock music and cinema, 51% of British voters say they are now concerned about its impact on our culture.</p> <p>The survey shows that when it comes to the preferences in the presidential election, John Kerry would win by 50% to George Bush's 22% if the poll was of British voters, a margin of more than two to one.</p> <p>But the detailed results also show that when asked if they had favourable or unfavourable view of Kerry, 45% replied \"don't know\" suggesting not that much is known about the Democrat challenger in Britain.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> ICM Research interviewed a random sample of 1,008 adults aged 18 and over by telephone between September 22-23, 2004.

  "It is a clich\u00e9 of newspaper leader columns that they conclude by calling for a national debate. For a change, this leader will begin by calling for one. Voters in Britain, having watched the three enthralling Bush-Kerry presidential debates, may wonder why there are no similar televised showdowns between their party leaders. There are good reasons why not. America has a long history of such debates, going back to the epic Douglas-Lincoln contests of 1858, dubbed \"the most famous war of words in history\". In contrast, the British style has been solitary speeches to mass audiences, notably Gladstone's barnstorming Midlothian campaign in 1879. <p>More importantly, British voters don't get to choose between Tony Blair or Michael Howard directly. Instead they vote for local MPs, making a debate between party leaders constitutionally (if not practically) irrelevant. Then there is the wider political spectrum here - instead of a Republican or Democrat duopoly, British voters can for example choose between Labour, Lib Dem, Tory, Sinn Fein, Plaid Cymru, SDLP, SNP or Democratic Unionists, depending on where they live, not to mention Ukip and others. That makes it harder to say exactly who deserves to debate who. </p> <p>The most telling argument against a Blair-Howard election debate is that it encourages presidential-style politics at a time when parliamentary democracy is struggling. But beware of making the best the enemy of the good. A leaders' debate, in whatever form, would engage voters and increase public awareness - a vital consideration as turnout fades. Carefully moderated contests, of 90 minutes or more, would force the leaders to discuss policy, rather than indulge in yah-booism. To avoid creeping presidentialism, we suggest holding a series of three debates: one between the three major party leaders, a second between the chancellor and two shadow chancellors, and a third between the home secretary and rivals, all to be broadcast live by the BBC. Similar debates could also be held simultaneously in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Bring it on.</p>",
  "<p>Well away from television cameras, the media, and troublesome hunting supporters, John Prescott has spent the last three days on the campaign trail pushing his pet project. </p> <p>Microphone in one hand and leaflets in the other, he has hopped unannounced from cities to market towns with the message that England's most northerly region should chart its own destiny. </p> <p>Unscripted and sometimes off-message, he has mixed it with voters from Sunderland, to Consett and Hexham, occasionally throwing caution to the wind and railing against a Whitehall machine he clearly mistrusts. \"You've got an historic opportunity to take back control held by civil servants in London,\" he tells shoppers. \"The people in the north-east know more about their communities than anyone else, understand the problems and strengths of their area.\" </p> <p>But the slogan on Labour's white battle bus betrays a little nervousness in the run-up to the country's first regional devolution referendum, on which the deputy prime minister has staked considerable credibility: \"This is your chance - let's not waste it.\" </p> <p>In four days' time, 1.9 million electors will begin receiving voting papers for an all-postal referendum to determine whether the north-east should have an elected assembly, broadly similar to the Greater London authority. But Mr Prescott is still haggling with sceptical Cabinet colleagues over the powers it should have. </p> <p>More than anything, this is his grand project and a yes vote - counting takes place on November 4 - would crown a long political career in which he has often been a lone champion of English devolution. But three months ago he was forced to \"postpone\" plans for other referendums in the north-west and in Yorkshire after a rebellion by backbench Labour MPs. They feared a bruising devolution battle in marginal seats would undermine the party six months before a likely general election. </p> <p>Although Labour's old north-east heartland was seen as a safer bet, polls have shown that about a quarter of voters are undecided, with one survey in a local paper this week giving the nocampaign the edge. </p> <p>Mr Prescott will return to the stump next week in the knowledge that his project is resting on a knife-edge amid indications that the campaign is finally exciting the electorate. </p> <p>Referendum broadcasts began last night on regional television. The first, a four-minute offering from the North East Says No campaign (Nesno) - directed by an official from a rightwing London thinktank - unashamedly took its cue from negative US-style campaigning. Nesno has backing from the Tories and the UK Independence party. </p> <p>A series of images portrayed senior Labour MPs beside the headline \"Politicians have let us down\". It was followed with the exhortation \"Vote no to just more politicians\" and then \"Politicians talk, we pay\" - a reference to the costs of the proposed assembly. It will be able to place a levy on council taxpayers, initially around 5%. </p> <p>Although a north-east industrialist, John Elliott, chairs the nocampaign, it is led by James Frayne, campaign director of the New Frontiers Foundation, which describes itself as a \"free market think-tank which grew out of Business for Sterling\", the anti-euro campaign. </p> <p>Mr Elliott and Mr Frayne acknowledge that their opponents, the cross-party Yes for the North East campaign, have the slick publicity, and a string of local personalities. </p> <p>Featuring in the second broadcast tonight, they range from the ex-Olympic athlete Brendan Foster, to Sir John Hall, president of Newcastle United, Ray Mallon, the mayor of Middlesbrough and Steve Gibson, chairman of Middlesbrough FC. </p> <p>\"We have a very strong message and they've won the celebrity battle,\" Mr Frayne said. \"We are at war with a very well-funded establishment organisation, and they're playing with emotion - not facts.\" </p> <p>Ross Forbes, director of Yes for the North East, who lives near Newcastle and has worked in business and in the media, accuses his opponents of \"trading on fears\". He is not downhearted by the polls. \"It's perfectly winnable, but don't forget that this referendum is absolutely unprecedented. The cost of a no vote is very high. </p> <p>Across the region, debates have underlined a deep polarisation among electors. </p> <p>Sir John Hall, a key speaker, found it hard to contain his passion. \"There isn't anyone speaking up for this area, like Ken Livingstone in London,\" he thundered. \"The rest of the country is moving faster ahead than we are and we have to do something.\" </p> <p>Next week, on cue, Ken Livingstone is likely to join the call for a yes vote.</p>",
  "He may have two legs rather than four, no bushy tail and prefer his chicken cooked, but no one in Britain has a better idea of what it is like to be a fox than Alun Michael. The rural affairs minister, who has shepherded the anti-hunting legislation through the Commons, has become the quarry of the angriest of foxhunters. <p>He has had to cancel meetings, change his social engagements and watch over his shoulder after one of the most vitriolic campaigns against a minister since the person in charge of ending free school milk became Thatcher - milk snatcher. Mr Michael is even featured on one pro-hunting website as Hitler. </p> <p>It may be raining heavily, but about 200 hunt supporters have turned out to picket a conference Mr Michael is attending in Maidstone in Kent. The sight of his car is greeted with the sound of hunting horns. There is a large police presence but the protest, this time, is mild and four pro-hunters are allowed into the hotel where Mr Michael is to address the conference of Ruralnet, a countryside regeneration charity. </p> <p>Sue Palmer, a farmer's wife covered with pro-hunting badges, tells him \"the fox will be wiped out if you ban hunting, it will be far crueller\". She says her farm relies on the hunt to control foxes and if the ban goes ahead, they will have to shoot the hounds, \"and we'll do it publicly\". </p> <p>Kerry, whose husband works for the local hunt and has a tied cottage, asks: \"How would your wife feel if she was about to be made homeless?\" She says her husband will be out of work at 50. Mr Michael responds that he has had, in the past, to talk to steel workers in his Cardiff constituency who have also been forced to retrain late in life. </p> <p>There is some cut-and-thrust between the two sides with Mrs Palmer saying it is a town versus country issue. The hunters leave saying \"you're not going to see us go away\". </p> <p><b>Warning</b><br> </p> <p>The first indication Mr Michael was going to be the pro-hunting lobby's main target came with the launch of the right to roam in mid-September. He was due to attend a celebratory rally in the Peak District but pulled out once it became clear there would be a demonstration against him. He said police had warned him there might be violence. The Countryside Alliance said he exaggerated the advice and quoted the local police as saying there had been no mention of violence, merely of protest. He disputes that. </p> <p>\"The police advice was very clear that my presence was going to lead to thousands of protesters turning up which would have hijacked and distorted the whole event and the police would have been hard put to guarantee the safety of the public,\" he says. </p> <p>\"Given that we had invited walkers, families, disabled youngsters to promote the inclusive nature of access it would have been to undo several years of very hard work and distort an event which was meant to celebrate nearly 100 years of campaigning. By absenting myself from that, I enabled the story to be the opening of the right to roam. There are difficulties to taking that decision because you get the distortion of 'oh, you are afraid to come' or you are somehow not welcome in the countryside, which is another of their pieces of sloganising.\" </p> <p>Later in September he cancelled plans to take part in the launch of a trust fund to promote Dorset's Jurassic coast, which included sailing around the coast, once it became clear that hunters would be present in large numbers. \"I thought it important to be there but not as important for me to enjoy a voyage along the coast in the Waverley, the paddle steamer which was intended to be the high point of the day,\" he says. </p> <p>\"The police were seriously concerned about policing an event on the seaside and on a vessel. The Countryside Alliance says in a cloyingly patronising way that 'it's a pity the minister for rural affairs isn't welcome in the countryside'. Well, I'm sorry, I found myself most welcome in the countryside. It is the minority of people who hunt who don't welcome me.\" </p> <p>Then, in Exeter, for the meeting of the National Parks Association, the hunters tracked Mr Michael down to a hotel and pelted him with eggs and paint as he left, holding up signs saying Judas. </p> <p>\"When you look at the faces and expressions of hatred on the people and listen to the expletives people are shouting, you have to be worried about what that mentality can lead to,\" he says. \"Those are people who have an absolute judgment about me and anyone who votes against hunting yet they've never met me, never had a dialogue.\" </p> <p>Mr Michael, a former journalist with the South Wales Echo and a youth worker in Cardiff's docklands, became an MP in 1987 but has never been a confrontational politician. From his days as a shadow home office minister through his time at the Wales Office, he has adopted a low-key approach to political life which makes his predicament more remarkable. </p> <p>Is he surprised at the level of vitriol? \"Deeply disappointed because I put an enormous amount of effort in trying to get people to listen to each other ... Some of the people who take their children along to these events don't understand the particularly awful example they are setting. There is such a focused belief that they are right ... that I believe they find it almost impossible to look outside their own mindset,\" he says. </p> <p>\"I have to say it's been equally difficult to persuade people who oppose hunting that a little room needs to be given to hunting people to accept change. We are starting to see seriously intimidating protests, an attempt to bully. I've even heard people say this is what we fought the second world war for. Well, actually it was rather more to defend a parliamentary democracy in which individual MPs ... cast their votes in the way which they think is right. </p> <p>\"There's no sort of attempt at persuasion or argument. It seems basically to be threats and intimidation or almost a feeling that spoiling our lives is reasonable retribution for the legislation which anyway is in the hands of parliament. The abuse convinces me that this issue has to be resolved.\" </p> <p>What effect has it had on his family? \"They're not happy with it, they're clearly upset by it, but they're very supportive,\" he says. </p> <p>He says Peter Hain, as leader of the House of Commons, and Lord Whitty, who handles the legislation in the Lords, had been subject to personal protests. </p> <p>He believes the row will blow over. \"Presumably the same decisions were taken at the time to ban bear baiting or cock fighting or dog fighting but I think, in retrospect, few people would seek to justify any of those activities.\" </p> <p>Does he sympathise with the view expressed in the Observer that foxhunting is a side issue, that far greater cruelty to animals is inflicted by factory farming? \"It's a different issue,\" he says. Foxhunting has become such a big battle it has to be settled. It is a choice by individual MPs, not something imposed by the government. </p> <p>He says that after long negotiations with the Countryside Alliance there had been a falling out, not least because of the tone taken by the alliance's website - which they justified by saying they feared that if they were too restrained the more belligerent groups would take over. </p> <p><b>Extreme</b><br> </p> <p>\"The language of the most moderate seems to be dictated by an attempt to appease the most extreme,\" he says. </p> <p>John Jackson, the alliance's chairman, has told Mr Michael that protests against him were \"entirely of your own creation. I have lost count of the times I have told you that, if you did not keep your promise to address the question of hunting on principle and evidence, the country would erupt in fury.\" </p> <p>Mr Jackson went on to say that Mr Michael's remarks about the legislation had been \"tyrannical and cruel\". Mr Michael says his postbag splits down the middle with 7,500 to 8,000 letters saying \"ban everything\" and the same number saying \"leave everything alone\". </p> <p>Will this be Tony Blair's poll tax? \"That's a very unfair comparison,\" he says. </p> <p>He says many people in the countryside oppose hunting but are reluctant to say so. \"There is a much quieter but significant number of country people, including farmers, who will be delighted to see an end to hunting, but because that view is not voiced very strongly in the circles that hunting people frequent - perhaps quite wisely on the part of those who hold those opinions - they are reinforced in the view that such opinions don't exist. So they have this mythology that somehow they speak for the countryside. </p> <p>\"I've frequently had people in the margins of meetings in the last couple years coming up to me and saying 'I'm a farmer, I think what you're doing is absolutely right. These [fox-hunters] are very single-minded people and I would not particularly say this in public, but they do damage to my land they don't really do anything to control the vermin, they're a very narrow and selfish group of people.' And I've certainly had messages from a lot of people concerned about the countryside thanking me.\" </p> <p><b>Election</b><br> </p> <p>The tempo of the campaign against him seems unlikely to slacken in the run-up to the general election, although the issue may be less important to the electorate than the pro-hunt lobby suggest. </p> <p>On October 4, the Daily Telegraph reported the results of a poll in which they asked people what would make them vote Conservative. A promise to continue to allow foxhunting came 13th on the list, below reducing the number of speed cameras and a promise to build more prisons. Only 6% said a reintroduction of hunting would make them more likely to vote Tory, compared with 49% who would be motivated by a clampdown on immigration. </p> <p>Another target of the campaign is Sir Gerald Kaufman, who wrote in this newspaper about his experience at the Labour party conference in Brighton where he said he had been attacked by people calling him a \"Jewish bigot\", including some who broke open his briefcase, tore his conference pass off him and jostled him until he was rescued by police. He described them as \"racist, larcenous scum\". </p> <p>The alliance's response, in the form of a letter from the chief executive, Simon Hart, was that Sir Gerald had brought the trouble on himself and had deliberately provoked the response. </p> <p>\"The Alliance,\" wrote Mr Hart, \"is determined that our protests will remain lawful and peaceful but, however much I would regret it, I cannot guarantee that angry people will not react to the sort of provocation Sir Gerald put them under.\" </p> <p>The alliance has condemned specific protests, such as breaking in to the House of Commons and the dumping of animal carcasses in Brighton during the Labour conference, but has promised the cam-paign will continue at full tilt. </p> <p>Mr Michael is learning, like the fox, that the best bet is to listen for the sound of the hunting horn, keep ahead of the pack and, when necessary, go to ground. Among the hobbies he lists in Who's Who is long-distance running. </p>",
  "How excellent it would be if we Guardian readers helped save America from itself and the world from Bush (How you can have a say in the US election, G2, August 13). <p>However, I fear you have placed a loaded gun in the hands of Disgusteds of Islington. Nobody likes to be told what to do by someone who thinks they know better, least of all Americans about America. Already backed into an isolationist corner, the lack of dissent and a supine national media have made Americans particularly sensitive to any perceived criticism. The Guardian rightly urges caution and care when writing to the voters of Ohio's Clark County, but doesn't state the case strongly enough.</p> <p>While British penpals' powers of persuasion over Americans may be better than, say, those of the French, it is alarming to consider the result if letters are not read in the spirit intended, or worse, for those unable to resist an anti-Bush tirade, are read in the spirit intended. Such letters might galvanise \"patriots\" against Limey meddling. Imagining the capital Rush Limbaugh could make is frankly terrifying.</p> <p>Letter writers must tread very carefully.

Regardless of the heartfelt sentiments in the sample letters, Ohioans will view this as latte-drinking Londoners telling them what to do. John Kerry is still trying to backpedal from his \"global test\" comment; the mere hint of foreign intervention causes knee-jerk reactions in most Americans.</p> <p>Would it not be more appropriate to direct resources on telling UK voters how to get rid of Tony Blair? Is it easier to focus on the fantasy of influencing the US election than the harsh realities of New Labour?<br> <b> Wendy Thomas</b><br> London </p> <p>I have just seen a Fox News report about the Manchester Guardian telling its readers to send emails to influence American voters. Might I remind the editor that we had some unpleasantness about our sovereignty during the 1700s? Several of my ancestors fought in this war. Can I quote this, from our declaration of independence: \"Governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.\"</p> <p>We have the right to elect our own government.
