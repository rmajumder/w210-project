  "Against a backdrop of grim news from Iraq and North Ossetia, Italy has been grappling with two disturbing and divisive moral and emotional dilemmas of its own in recent days and weeks. <p>While Britain has been fearing for the safety of Kenneth Bigley, Italy's media has been haunted on a daily basis by speculation about the fate of Simona Pari and Simona Torretta, the two Italian aid-workers taken hostage two weeks ago. Although information has been scarce, national anxiety over the two 29-year-old women led the centre-right magazine <b>Panorama</b> to run a story entitled \"Anatomy of a kidnapping\" on its cover this week. </p> <p>As the country shuddered on Thursday at unconfirmed internet reports that \"the two Simonas\" had been executed, leftwing newspapers reiterated their calls for the US-led coalition to leave Iraq as soon as possible. </p> <p>\"John Kerry didn't have to say it the other day because we all knew already: the situation in Iraq seems now to be unsolvable, and soon it will be unsustainable,\" said the centre-left daily <b>La Repubblica</b> in an editorial calling for withdrawal. \"The 'reconstruction' and the attempts to pacify the country have failed. There is no longer any basis for the idea that in five or six months the worst might be over.\" </p> <p><b>Unita</b> held Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi to account for taking his country into an \"illegal\" war in Iraq. It reminded its readers that the UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, had said the invasion had been against international law and pointed out: \"Now it has been denounced solemnly and publicly, it is no longer possible to deny that the sham is over.\" </p> <p>The conservative <b>La Stampa</b> was stoic in the face of the threat to Italy's hostages, seeing the \"animal violence that stops at nothing\" in Iraq as a \"reminder of the necessity\" of the \"never-ending war\" and the war on terrorism, which \"unfortunately must go on\". </p> <p>The Vatican newspaper <b>L'Avvenire</b> warned that with each atrocity against hostages, western media outlets were being \"used\" by the militants in Iraq. \"Horror arrives punctually at prime-time, it pours into houses through televisions, it points the symbolic knife of the killer-kidnappers at the brains of the television viewers at the same time as the real knife moves towards the throat of the latest hostage,\" the papers said. \"But is all this inevitable? Is it useful? Who for? It is clear that many rebel and terrorist groups are carrying out the kidnappings and killings just for media impact. Is it really impossible for public and private television channels in the 25 European Union countries to agree not to transmit the images the terrorists have constructed and choreographed to sink a knife into our collective conscience?\" </p> <p>Meanwhile, a particularly Italian debate about morality has occupied those minds not devoting their thoughts to what to do about the Italian hostages and the war in Iraq. </p> <p>Earlier this year, the Italian government tightened the law surrounding fertility treatment, banning research on embryos and limiting fertility treatment to stable, heterosexual couples using their own eggs and sperm. The intention was to help the country shed its reputation as being the \"wild west\" of embryology. But there is now a growing campaign for a referendum to overturn the law, and the media have accused the government of bowing to pressure from the Vatican to restrict treatment. </p> <p><b>Espresso</b> magazine this week said \"the law needs to be abolished\", and published the results of a poll in which 54% of Italians said they would vote to overturn the law in a referendum. </p> <p>Newspapers have demanded the health minister, Girolamo Sirchia, review the controversial law, filling their pages with detailed accounts describing the suffering caused by the law. Politicians of both left and right have formed ad hoc alliances, united by their support for objection to the law as the prospect of a referendum looms. </p> <p>On Wednesday, Giuliano Ferrara, editor of the centre-right, pro-government daily <b>Il Foglio</b>, wrote that \"the referendum has got to be done,\" although his paper called on Italians to uphold the law. \"One of the two fundamental problems of our time (the other is the war) has been entrusted to public debate: that's a good thing,\" the paper said. </p> <p>\"The forces that are worried about bioethical modernisation and eugenics that are unregulated should mobilise. Otherwise they deserve to lose,\" it concluded.</p>",
  "<p>George Bernard Shaw wrote just one play about Ireland, only to have WB Yeats turn it down. It was obviously too prophetic for the Abbey Theatre. Written exactly 100 years ago at the height of the home rule debates, before two sets of 20th-century Troubles further bloodied the waters between Ireland and England, it is an unforgiving and fantastically funny dissection of the rights and wrongs of the relationship. </p> <p>Shaw turns stereotype on its head by having a romantic English businessman, Broadbent, set off to \"save\" Ireland with his fearfully reluctant Irish friend Doyle - at once a self-flagellating representation of Shaw himself and an uncanny vision of the rapacious Ryanair capitalists who have now emerged to ride the Celtic Tiger. </p> <p>About this and so much else, Shaw was right. If only we'd listened. Shaw the dramatist was always a little didactic, but his defrocked priest Keegan, played with near-mystical magnetism by the remarkable Lalor Roddy, is surely one of the great poetic creations. This wandering seeker - who, having spent his youth in the universities of Europe, finds himself driven mad by Ireland - is the only one to see through the false dawn of neo-liberal efficiency offered by Broadbent, who is played with more than a hint of Tony Blair by Alan Cox. </p> <p>Worthy as it is to reproduce the original text to the last syllable, it's doubtful whether Shaw's bony bottom could have taken the full three hours of John Bull; even his characters complain of how much \"they go on\". But with talks about home rule for the north bogged down again this week, the lesson was never more needed. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Until October 16. Box office: 028-9038 1081.</p>",
  "<p>A humiliating Champions League debut seen from the bench, a dressing-room revolt, and a manager who walked after just four matches, to be replaced by the goalkeeping coach. Michael Owen must be wondering what he has let himself in for. And that despite almost certainly being unaware of his own central role in events that, with admirable restraint, he describes as \"strange\". </p> <p>If only David Beckham, or even Steve McManaman, had warned him. For, while Jos\u00e9 Antonio Camacho lost the players, much of Madrid's ills, including fractious relations, have far deeper roots - the product of a presidential policy obsessed with marketing, trained only on the gal\u00e1cticos . One that, unbeknownst to him, made Owen, the latest star-signing, the eye of the storm. </p> <p>Two defeats hardly constitute a full-on crisis, but such reverses as that dished out by Bayer Leverkusen are not new; and neither are the circumstances that sparked Camacho's resignation. \"My team-mates assured me that it's not always like this,\" Owen said. He should treat such information with caution. </p> <p>After all, there have been uprisings before and last season Madrid - the white angels, the loudly self-proclaimed greatest club in the world - won nothing at all (and registered a club-record-five successive defeats). And while president Florentino P\u00e9rez leapt eagerly upon Carlos Queiroz for a scapegoat, his autocratic model was pernicious and Madrid's problems profound. </p> <p>A bruising club legend, Camacho was central to P\u00e9rez's summer election campaign, his brilliantly engineered political saviour, the man who would impose discipline and bring down the capricious, bloated superstar image that infuriated fans. A culture that spawned white hankies, jeers and even last season an indiscriminate 30-foot banner reading: \"For you, whores and money, for us indignation.\" But, handily for P\u00e9rez, it was one that shifted attention to players and coach. </p> <p>He said it couldn't happen with Camacho. But despite apparent changes, the internal circumstances have repeated themselves. Camacho represented Madrid's PR-driven managerial ideal type. But the model has changed four times in three years: from the understated, old-school psychology of Vicente Del Bosque, to the modernity, low profile and worldly charm of Queiroz, to the raw tub-thumping of Camacho, and now, with Mariano Garc\u00eda Rem \u00f3n, back to Del Bosque, moustache and all. </p> <p>Camacho was never likely to succeed, too blunt, too domineering to win over a dressing room used to power. Nonetheless, the player power influence needs some deflating, even if it was the detonator this time; it is but a product of the unique way Madrid is run and Camacho's relationship with P\u00e9rez was little better. </p> <p>Already a difficult environment to enter, harder still to withstand, Madrid was more complicated by Owen's arrival. Another superstar, yet different this time; even P\u00e9rez didn't seem as enamoured as usual. He had turned him down earlier, but would never - never, never, never - let a summer pass without the obligatory gal\u00e1ctico, returning to the Liverpool striker as other doors closed. </p> <p>Compensation came with the price, just \u00a38m, a Ballon d'Or , and his nationality; Beckham had shown Madrid how lucrative the English market could be. A deal with BP followed. </p> <p>But if P\u00e9rez wasn't totally convinced, Camacho, who wanted Patrick Vieira, was even less so. It wasn't that he didn't rate Owen, but he couldn't find him a place. How could he drop Ronaldo or Ra\u00fal? And he'd promised Fernando Morientes time on the pitch. It dawned on Camacho, a man who demands control, that apparent change was illusory; like Queiroz and Del Bosque, his hands were tied. From all sides. </p> <p>Previous gal\u00e1cticos had roles to play; Owen's arrival posed a threat to Madrid's core - to their captain Ra\u00fal and existing stars - bringing to the boil simmering discontent. It is emphatically not about Owen personally or professionally, however, but what he represents. And with his linguistic limitations, the new boy was both blameless and surely ignorant of his centrality. \"Obviously I don't know all their conversations because of the language problem,\" he admits. </p> <p>Some senior foreign players were irritated that Owen remained a sub while Ra\u00fal continued to perform poorly, but when the Englishman immediately leapfrogged the eternally shunted Morientes in the substitutes' queue and then, against Espanyol, replaced the captain, the touchpaper was truly lit. </p> <p>Camacho was accused by a faction comprising Guti, Ra\u00fal and Morientes of bowing to media and marketing pressure. And when the coach discovered they had run to P\u00e9rez, who did not defend him, he walked, lamenting that until culture and priorities change Madrid will ever be thus. The news that Adidas had complained about Beckham being dropped merely confirmed Camacho's belief - and illustrated just what Michael Owen has walked into. Welcome to Real Madrid.</p>",

  "<p>Richard, thanks for that warm welcome. It's great to be back here in the International Conference Centre in the heart of Birmingham. </p> <p>What a great European city this is! Go and take a look! It's been transformed from a city of the motor car to a city for people. It's now got a heart. </p> <p>And it's got the wow factor - with great new architecture, from Brindleyplace to the new Bullring. They're reusing the canals, the warehouses, the workshops - the old wasting assets brought back to life to serve the community.</p> <p>It was here that we held the successful Urban Summit 2 years ago - where I set out the Government's new agenda for housing and sustainable communities. At Manchester, next year, we are holding an international Sustainable Communities Summit, which will spell out our ideas for the future. </p> <p>Many of you had a big part to play in shaping these new agendas and driving them forward. You've been delivering the decent homes, building more affordable homes, helping the homeless and the vulnerable, tackling low demand, providing more homes for key workers.</p> <p>Can I congratulate the housing associations and the Housing Corporation for what you've done. When I started this job back in 1997, I remember meeting Sir Brian Pearce and his team from the Housing Corporation. They spoke to me in some weird housing language. </p> <p>They told me that the TCI's too small. The HIP needs to be bigger. The RTB and the RTA are reducing our stock. And the ADP is not enough. Of course I said. Yes. Exactly. Precisely. And I said what about the SC? There's no SC! </p> <p>No sustainable communities!</p> <p>Well, now I see the Federation are on board for SC!</p> <p>But housing's not about jargon - it's about creating sustainable communities:<br> <strong>\u00b7</strong> mixed communities, <br><strong>\u00b7</strong> prosperous communities, <br><strong>\u00b7</strong> cleaner, safer, greener communities <br><strong>\u00b7</strong> sustainable communities in places where people want to live. </p> <p>That's what we're about. That's why we're here. That's why we're in business together. In business for neighbourhoods.</p> <p>It's not always been like that. </p> <p>Don't forget the mess we inherited in 1997: <br><strong>\u00b7</strong> Boom bust economics. <br><strong>\u00b7</strong> A \u00a319 billion backlog of housing repairs. <br><strong>\u00b7</strong> Over 2 million homes in the social sector failing to meet a decent standard. <br><strong>\u00b7</strong> Capital spending on housing cut in half. <br><strong>\u00b7</strong> House building at its lowest level for 70 years. <br><strong>\u00b7</strong> More families in bed and breakfast. <br><strong>\u00b7</strong> Over a million council houses sold off at knockdown prices, costing us billions in subsidy</p> <p>And top it off with the Housing Minister, Sir George Young, with his infamous complaint about tripping over rough sleepers on his way from the opera. </p> <p>That's the legacy we inherited. </p> <p>A Government policy which was against social housing. It meant - <br><strong>\u00b7</strong> Fewer houses in the public sector <br><strong>\u00b7</strong> Higher rents <br><strong>\u00b7</strong> More on housing benefit <br><strong>\u00b7</strong> More homelessness <br><strong>\u00b7</strong> More repossessions and negative equity. <br><strong>\u00b7</strong> And ever more revenue subsidy</p> <p>In the first 2 years, we adopted the Tory Government's spending plans. </p> <p>We had to make tough decisions because we had to get economic stability, we had to get the national debt down, and we had to get the public finances right.</p> <p>Spending was tight, but we did have the capital receipts which weren't being used for housing. You only had to see the state of the housing stock to see that repairs were urgently needed. 5 million people were living in substandard homes in the public sector. </p> <p>That's why we launched our decent homes programme and it's been a huge success. We've invested over \u00a313 billion of public money on decent homes. </p> <p>Through the transfer programme, you've levered in another \u00a35 billion of private money. That's a total of \u00a318 billion invested in our decent homes programme. You've done a great job and thanks for that. </p> <p>As you know we also introduced ALMOs and the housing PFI scheme. </p> <p>They've all got a part to play. </p> <p>We've shown that public private partnerships work. </p> <p>In fact, we've cut the number of non-decent homes by over a million. </p> <p>They may not be new houses, but they're new homes to the people who live in them. 650,000 homes fitted with new central heating, 240,000 new kitchens and 180,000 new bathrooms.</p> <p>Those are the figures, but you only realise the true impact if you visit people like Molly, who I went to see in her council house in West London. </p> <p>I was expecting to see a traditional bathroom- but she now had a specially converted wetroom which allowed her disabled husband, Joe, to have a bath in his disabled chair, in his own home. Before that, he had to go to the centre down the road. </p> <p>That's the difference a decent home has made to him and Molly.</p> <p>But we've still got a lot of work to do to make every social home decent by 2010. It's an ambitious target. We've made the money available - including a new \u00a3180 million gap funding scheme to support transfers where the homes have negative value.</p> <p>It's a double challenge. You've got to repair the stock you have and help improve homes transferred from local authorities. </p> <p>Thanks for the progress you're already making and I've every confidence that together we will meet the target. </p> <p>That was the first phase of our programme, and it was from there that we started to develop the Sustainable Communities Plan.</p> <p>We needed a strategy that addressed the different housing problems in different regions: </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> high demand in the South, </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> low demand in the North, </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> and the need for sustainable communities rather than housing estates.</p> <p>We needed to tackle the desperate shortage of homes in the South, as well as the problem of empty and abandoned homes in parts of the Midlands and the North.</p> <p>And it's much more than bricks and mortar. That's the lesson we've learnt from the past, when we built soulless housing estates and tower blocks with their walkways in the sky.</p> <p>Yes, housing is important - but it's more than that - it's about sustainable communities which provide jobs, regeneration, transport, better public services, cleaner, safer, greener places to live. And we need the raise the quality bar, and make sure that we get better planning, better architecture, better design, and better eco-efficiency.</p> <p>It can be done. And, I don't see any reason why we should settle for second best - when we know we can match the best in the world.</p> <p>That approach is at the heart of what we're trying to achieve in the \u00a338 billion Sustainable Communities Plan which I launched in February last year. </p> <p>It's under that Plan that we are:</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Doubling investment in social housing</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Doubling investment in key worker housing</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Doubling the money for affordable housing in rural areas</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Trebling investment in tackling low demand</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Increasing spending on decent homes</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Increasing spending on our most deprived areas</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> And creating a new 'Safer and Stronger Communities Fund' to pay for more wardens, more parks and more green spaces.</p> <p>So a lot's being done, and housing's right at the top of the political agenda. </p> <p>But as Kate Barker said in her Housing Review, the imbalances in our housing markets can't be solved overnight. </p> <p>But for the first time a Government is facing up to the failure of housing markets and the challenge of low demand and abandonment in parts of the North and Midlands.</p> <p>Our investment in housing market renewal is concentrated on the 9 Pathfinders and will triple to \u00a3450 million by 2008. This will help create sustainable communities in these areas of decline. It's a tall order but it can be done with your help.</p> <p>In the London and the South East, there's a different set of challenges. We're faced with a huge shortage of homes that has built up over decades. House prices have been rising much faster than wages, and the market has failed to deliver.</p> <p>That's why we are building 200,000 extra homes in the Thames Gateway - the largest brownfield site in Western Europe - and the other 3 Growth Areas.</p> <p>And it's why we are providing resources for an extra 10,000 social rented homes a year by 2008 - a 50% increase compared with today.</p> <p>Indeed, over the next 3 years, we will provide over 115,000 new affordable homes for rent and low cost homeownership.</p> <p>We're beginning to make an impact. The number of affordable homes is at last increasing again. With the 4 new Growth Areas - and our additional investment in housing - we will increase the supply of new homes from 146,000 a year to 175,000.</p> <p>But that is at the lower end of Kate Barker's recommendations. She said that, in order to create equilibrium and stability in the market, we might need as many as 100,000 more houses each year on top of that!</p> <p>What we're doing is a huge improvement but this really shows the scale of the challenge that faces us. And the scale of this task means that we have to get the maximum number of quality homes built for the money we have available.</p> <p>The lack of affordable homes has a knock on effect on homelessness. It's bound to. The numbers have risen - but they've risen because we've widened the safety net and moved people off the streets and out of B&amp;Bs and into better temporary accommodation. At the last count we'd reduced the number of children in bed and breakfast from over 6,000 to virtually zero.</p> <p>And the number of rough sleepers is down by nearly 75%. </p> <p>But, it's not just about giving people a roof over their head. We want to give them a permanent home of their own.</p> <p>You've a big role to play in this, but it does mean much closer co-operation with the local authorities.</p> <p>We have to ask to ourselves what is the best way to use our money to create sustainable communities. </p> <p>It is too evident that you can have housing estates and no community, but you cannot have a sustainable community without housing - houses to rent, houses for sale, public and private. And much more of them.</p> <p>However it is now overwhelmingly clear that the market system alone cannot provide sufficient affordable housing. And that social housing provision involving public finance subsidy is needed in one form or another. </p> <p>The extent of subsidy can be seen in the discount provided for Right to Buy - which cost over \u00a340 billion. Whilst this increased home ownership by 1.7 million houses, the cost was a reduction of social housing by 1.7 million homes, and a massive \u00a319 billion disinvestment in the remaining public housing.</p> <p>The difficulties have become even more acute in our rural areas. I agree with your manifesto for neighbourhoods about more affordable homes in rural areas, where your efforts are well appreciated. </p> <p>I do recognise the forceful demand for more land and more flexible use of housing funds which I am happy to discuss further with you - and of course the Treasury.</p> <p>As you are aware, we will continue the Right to Buy, although we have acted to restrict its abuse and have reduced discounts in housing crisis areas. But it has helped raise homeownership to 70% and make estates more mixed in their tenure. More mixed tenure. Different types of tenants. Private housing and social housing side by side. Some 100% homeownership. Some part owned. Some rented. That will help make social housing more of a positive. Make it more attractive and more acceptable.</p> <p>Our challenge is to create communities where people want to live. Not places they want feel trapped. That means we need more houses and more choice.</p> <p>It's why I asked the Housing Corporation's previous Chairman Brenda Dean to produce a report on how to develop a greater range of choice in the way people purchase a home, particularly people on lower incomes and first time buyers.</p> <p>Brenda said we could do a lot more to bring together the different types of programmes we have to promote homeownership. And she also said we can be a lot more creative in the ways we encourage homeownership and still protect the existing social housing stock.</p> <p>That's the kind of thinking I want you to develop and work on. We need new thinking and new ideas. </p> <p>But this is not just for the policy mekons - it's also about the hard economics.</p> <p>We've got to drive down costs and we need to be more efficient.</p> <p>It's costing more and more to build housing - and particularly, social housing.</p> <p>I have looked at the figures. They're not pleasant. In fact, they're completely unacceptable. Despite sustained low inflation and low interest rates, the cost of building new social housing has risen by 63% since 1997. That's more than three times the rate of inflation!</p> <p>The average subsidy going into each Housing Association home for rent has more than doubled - from \u00a327,000 in 1997 to \u00a366,000 in 2004.</p> <p>And even then, I know you still have to top up with your own money, to make the sums add up. In London, it's even worse. The average grant there has increased to nearly \u00a3100,000. That's every 10 houses needing a subsidy of \u00a31 million to meet this ever increasing housing inflation. It's unacceptable.</p> <p>Indeed the total amount of housing subsidies and grants amounts to over \u00a314 billion, just to keep up with the market price.</p> <p>Just compare our costs with our international competitors. In the last 7 years, building tender prices have gone up by less than inflation in France and Italy.</p> <p>In our own islands, Scottish homes cost a quarter less to build than English homes, because they use modern methods of construction.</p> <p>We've got to get better value for money. There must be a different way of doing things. </p> <p>A similar story is evident in land prices which have been increasing at a rate of more than 15% a year. That's bad for house prices, good for the phenomenal profits being made by the building industry - but supported by ever increasing public subsidies.</p> <p>So the Government has a part to play. We've got the Housing Corporation and English Partnerships working hand in hand for greater efficiency and effectiveness. I thought about merging the two organisations, but instead I put the chairmen on each other's boards. That's certainly made the sparks fly! And together they're doing very well.</p> <p>And now we've set the Housing Corporation some pretty tough efficiency targets for the next three years. By 2008, we expect the whole social housing sector to deliver efficiency gains worth at least \u00a3830 million a year. That includes an 8% real saving on the cost of new supply - which means switching more money from administration to the provision of new and better housing.</p> <p>I know Jon Rouse is on your tail about this, with his Operating Costs Index. And he's right to do so. We need more efficiency for the sake of tenants and all those people who are in your homes and on the your waiting lists.</p> <p>I don't want to play the numbers game, and maintaining quality is vital, but in some areas there are as many as 50 or 70 housing associations. Sometimes half a dozen in one street. Each with their own offices, their own maintenance, their own building contracts, their own management. We have to ask ourselves - is this really the best way to do things? Does that deliver the maximum number of homes?</p> <p>And it's right to question whether we are managing our land supply in the most efficient way. Land is a considerable part of the costs of providing homes, and I'm convinced that we can use land more effectively. </p> <p>With land prices so high, there must be a better way of doing it. It's crazy that we have been subsidising housing for key workers in our hospitals, our schools and our police - because you can't have sustainable communities without these essential public service workers - and yet we've been selling off NHS and other public land to the highest bidder! </p> <p>I then have to go to the Treasury to ask for more subsidy to provide more housing. We do need a more efficient and more effective way of using public land - a more comprehensive form of land management.</p> <p>That's why we're now making use of surplus NHS and Ministry of Defence land for new housing. And there's certainly more we can do with local authority land.</p> <p>Land's an important factor, but we've got to get construction costs down as well. Modern methods of construction is one way of doing this.</p> <p>I'm encouraged by your response to the \u00a3250 million Challenge Fund to encourage more innovation. </p> <p>We're building schemes in half the time - that's good - but why are the costs still the same as a traditionally built house. That doesn't make sense. Surely time is money? Where are the economies of scale? Where are the efficiency gains? There seem to be too many one-off schemes.</p> <p>Together, we've got to be sharper and smarter.</p> <p>You already working with the rest of the public sector, and delivering extra homes through imaginative new partnerships with local authorities. </p> <p>That's great, but we need to go further. I will be setting out new ideas about joint working in my 5 Year Departmental Plan which I'll be publishing shortly.</p> <p>Some of the ideas are in the Housing Bill, which, as you know, allows the private sector to bid for funds from the Housing Corporation. That shouldn't be seen as a threat, but as an opportunity to do new business with new and established partners.</p> <p>Some of you are already creating new partnerships, not just with new housing, but with regeneration and neighbourhood renewal schemes. I want to support that and I particularly want to congratulate you on the first anniversary of \"In Business for Neighbourhoods\". </p> <p>In Business for Neighbourhoods is a great idea because it about linking housing with jobs, welfare services, health, care in the community, and education. It's about creating safer, cleaner, greener places to live.</p> <p>It puts tenants first. </p> <p>So let's not forget what you've achieved.</p> <p>I was reminded of what we've and how things have changed when I went to the Housing Corporation' 40th Birthday. They showed Cathy Come Home - I've got the DVD.</p> <p>You know it brought back memories of what it was like in the 60's.</p> <p>Nearly 40 years ago 'Cathy Come Home' shocked a nation. It powerfully showed the devastating consequences of living in a society where there was little support and no choice. Cathy got married and was really enthusiastic about the future. You remember, she wanted a family, a nice house of her own, and even a Jag! </p> <p>It all started to go badly wrong when a child arrived. The kid wasn't welcome.</p> <p>She put herself on the waiting list, but it didn't make any difference.</p> <p>She was then forced into short term emergency accommodation, where she had to separate from her husband. He went off looking for work and she was left on her own. In desperation, she ended up with her child in a caravan, but that wasn't safe. The residents didn't like it and set the caravan on fire. The last scene was heart breaking when she was left to sleep on the street and in the railway station - and when they took the child away from her. And left her homeless and all alone.</p> <p>That doesn't happen today. We don't kick people out on the street, we don't take kids away from families, we don't leave people without support.</p> <p>Today Cathy would want a decent home, and to have choice between a home to rent, if she wants, and the opportunity to buy a home, or even part-buy, a home of her own. </p> <p>She wants choice and a community to live and work in. We're making that happen. We're working together to give the Cathys of today the home and the choices they deserve.</p> <p>I'm proud of what we've done. But the Cathy of today wants more choice, and place where she can feel proud, safe and secure.</p> <p>Our task is not to just give Cathy a home, but to give her a community. </p> <p>A sustainable community. <br>That's the challenge for all of us. <br>Thank you.</p>",
  "It's three party British politics. <p>That's been the real lesson of this year.</p> <p>Take those local elections.</p> <p>Big Liberal Democrat gains.</p> <p>Taking on and trouncing Labour in places like Cardiff and Cambridge, Liverpool and Newcastle;</p> <p>Making big gains from them in Leeds and Manchester as well.</p> <p>While in most of these places the Conservatives just simply disappeared.</p> <p>You know it is telling indeed that the voters did not think it worthwhile electing a single Conservative councillor in a place like Oxford.</p> <p>And if you take Scotland and Wales into account and they're scarcely a national UK political party any longer.</p> <p>And Liberal Democrats continued making gains from the Conservatives in places like Portsmouth, St Albans and Watford.</p> <p>In his first speech as the new Liberal Democrat Leader in Newcastle - after thirty years of one party Labour rule - this is what Peter Arnold had to say: -</p> <p>\"For Newcastle Liberal Democrats, one of the most important success criteria will be the extent to which we are able to give the city back to the people...We will be doing things differently, by making sure the Council is less politically partisan and more inclusive. We will be offering Opposition Groups the opportunity to adopt a more positive role in the council's affairs.\"</p> <p>Now there's the difference for you - in a nutshell.</p> <p>As that onetime Liberal, Winston Churchill, put it: \"In victory - magnanimity.\"</p> <p>That's the breath of fresh air that we bring to British politics - and to local communities with it.</p> <p>That's why we're on the move.</p> <p>And that's why we pushed Labour into third place for the first time ever in a national election.</p> <p>Add to those the European elections results.</p> <p>We stuck firmly to our reforming pro-European principles.</p> <p>And the outcome?</p> <p>Two more Liberal Democrat Members of the European Parliament. </p> <p>Fiona Hall in the North East.</p> <p>And Saj Karim in the North West.</p> <p>Saj - our first ever elected Liberal Democrat parliamentarian from an ethnic minority community.</p> <p>And about time too.</p> <p>But not unique for long.</p> <p>In Leicester South - just as in Brent East last year - we leapfrogged the Conservatives - we came from third place to take on Labour and win.</p> <p>Congratulations, Parmjit Gill.</p> <p>And never forget we came within an ace of doing the same in Birmingham Hodge Hill as well.</p> <p>Well done, Nicola Davies.</p> <p>So fantastic results. Each and every one.</p> <p>And when you leave Bournemouth make sure that your next stop is Hartlepool.</p> <p>That's where I'm heading next.</p> <p>Immediately after this speech.</p> <p>Lembit Opik is flying me there.</p> <p>I kid you not.</p> <p>Greater love hath no man for our party than his is prepared to place his life in Lembit's safe keeping in the skies above us.</p> <p>So I expect to see you all there in Hartlepool. Well, I really do hope to see you all there in Hartlepool!</p> <p>We are the challengers.</p> <p>The Conservatives have already conceded they aren't in the Hartlepool race. </p> <p>And it's a simple statement of fact that the Conservatives are now out of the race in most of urban Britain. </p> <p>And that the only effective challenge to Labour is coming from the Liberal Democrats. </p> <p>People know we've done it before - and we can do it again in Hartlepool.</p> <p>If we go out there and make our case - make no mistake.</p> <p>We CAN do it. </p> <p>I want to talk to you today about the future.</p> <p>The future of two things.</p> <p>The future of our party.</p> <p>And also the future of our country.</p> <p>We want the two increasingly to go hand in hand.</p> <p>We know we can make the political weather - tuition fees, the council tax.</p> <p>And we know we're capable of much more yet.</p> <p>But our success also poses certain questions - and rightly so. </p> <p>Are these people up to it?</p> <p>Are those Liberal Democrats ready for the task in hand?</p> <p>Can we be sure we know what they stand for?</p> <p>Well we stand for three things above all else.</p> <p>Freedom. Fairness. Trust. </p> <p>Those are our watchwords.</p> <p>Those are the core principles against which our policies must be measured. </p> <p>And they are the principles which match the increasingly liberal instincts of 21st century Britain.</p> <p>A Britain now of many faiths, many colours, many languages;<br> A variety of family structures; <br> Far greater life expectancy. <br> And working patterns our grandparents would scarcely recognise. <br>Social mobility and fast communications; High aspirations and far less deference; <br>Openness and tolerance about sexual orientation.</p> <p>A Britain where the individual counts for so much </p> <p>But still a Britain where a sense of community matters. </p> <p>In so many ways that's a liberal Britain.</p> <p>It's our task now to turn these instinctively liberal attitudes into positive votes for the party of British liberal democracy.</p> <p>And it is also a Britain in which the way we are governed is being transformed. </p> <p>We have a Scottish Parliament and National Assembly for Wales, both elected by fairer votes - involving proportional representation.</p> <p>And -on November 4th people in the North East will have a referendum for a regional assembly. We're out campaigning hard for that - and I'll be back on that campaign trail again shortly.</p> <p>Devolution is at its best when it gets things done. And it's getting things done that show people what we value and what we stand for.</p> <p>It's been a big responsibility for us, in Wales, where we helped bring much needed stability to the Assembly at a crucial moment - and better policies as a result.</p> <p>Reduced class sizes; more environmental initiatives; free school milk; Free admission to art galleries and museums, recognising that the legacy and the vitality of Celtic culture demands the decision-makers to understand not just the price of things but also the value of things.</p> <p>As a result - people know more about what we stand for. And they're voting accordingly.</p> <p>Impressive gains this year in Cardiff, Bridgend and Swansea - and so many other places across the country.</p> <p>And in Wales we carry on pushing for an extension to the law making powers of the Assembly - that has to be the next logical and necessary step forward.</p> <p>And in Scotland where the partnership there has been delivering on many of our top priorities;</p> <p>Free personal care for the elderly - delivered.</p> <p>Abolishing tuition fees - delivered.</p> <p>Fair votes for local government elections - being delivered. </p> <p>But it doesn't stop there.</p> <p>Liberal Democrats in government in Scotland have set the new agenda for devolution. </p> <p>A Scottish agenda that deals with long-term challenges - like poor health; the environment; the need to improve education, the foundation for an enterprising country.</p> <p>New legislation announced by Jim Wallace just this month to provide free eye and dental checks for all.</p> <p>And a new Environment Bill announced by Ross Finnie so that a green thread runs through the heart of Scottish government, one where every policy will be audited for its environmental impact.</p> <p>Liberal Democrats getting things done. </p> <p>And demonstrating how our approach - every time - is rooted in freedom, fairness and trust. </p> <p>I've done a lot of travelling across Britain this year.</p> <p>And with it a lot of listening.</p> <p>I listened to the students on campus in Plymouth, worried about their steadily deepening debts and how on earth they would ever escape them.</p> <p>I listened to the young mother in a Leicester shop, troubled that teachers are not getting the time to teach her children properly.</p> <p>I listened to the Asian grandmother in Huddersfield, who told me about being genuinely afraid, for the first time in over thirty years in her local community, because of the growth of mindless racism among an unrepresentative few.</p> <p>And then the high street traders in Birmingham, utterly sick and tired of senseless vandalism against their properties.</p> <p>And their local customers, equally scared about street violence and the threat of crime as it affects them personally.</p> <p>The pensioners in Exeter - bitter about their dwindling resources, confused about losing their pension books, unhappy about the level of pensions themselves and angry about seemingly never-ending council tax rises.</p> <p>And to the doctor in Norwich, expressing his sheer frustration at the remote, command and control from London which characterises so much of this government's mismanagement of our National Health Service.</p> <p>And then the school pupils in Cardiff, thinking aloud about pollution and climate change - uncertain about the environment they would inherit.</p> <p>This is our Britain today; these are typical of people's concerns.</p> <p>Well, if you seek to lead, first you must listen.</p> <p>People have a huge desire to be listened to; for politicians to take the time to understand their problems.</p> <p>And address those problems with solutions.</p> <p>It is we Liberal Democrats that are now providing the answers.</p> <p>For students - when the pupil aspires to become the student, we would encourage and enable them - by stopping tuition fees and axing top-up fees - one of the most socially retrograde acts of this government, when what Britain needs is a university system affordable to all.</p> <p>For parents - we will equip children for life - because children well cared for and well taught in their early years have a far better chance of success.</p> <p>So we will reduce class sizes for the youngest children and give teachers time to teach and children time to learn by abolishing unnecessary tests and red tape.</p> <p>And we would ensure that every child, in every classroom, in every school is taught by a qualified teacher in the relevant subject.</p> <p>That's what the Liberal Democrats stand for.</p> <p>For those in fear of racism - first, a real lead from politicians - celebrating the fact that our country is better, it's richer and more diverse, precisely because it is a multicultural society.</p> <p>And that we have been prepared to stand out and if necessary alone in having no truck with short-term, knee-jerk responses to complex social issues.</p> <p>That we won't pander to the lowest common denominator over asylum and immigration. But we'll reform the systems - to make them fairer and faster.</p> <p>And that we respect people's genuine religious and cultural identities at community level. </p> <p>That's what the Liberal Democrats stand for.</p> <p>On Crime - 10,000 more police on the streets and cutting the time spent on paperwork, so they can spend more time tackling drug dealers, muggers and yobs.</p> <p>Use prison as an opportunity to educate in the basics - numeracy, literacy - so that when they get out people will be far better able to find work and far less likely to reoffend.</p> <p>And for the victims of crime open up the courts so that they can confront the offenders - and speed up the system of compensation as well.</p> <p>That's what the Liberal Democrats stand for.</p> <p>For pensioners - we will continue - to make and win the case for axing the unjust, unfair, increasingly unworkable council tax.</p> <p>And its replacement by a fair, local income tax - based on people's ability to pay.</p> <p>We'll stop the scandal of elderly people having to pay for their personal care - and probably losing the family home in the process. We would deliver free long-term care for the elderly.</p> <p>And all pensioners over 75 - the war generation - should be entitled to a pension which lifts them above mean-testing - \u00a3100 extra a month. No-one should be demeaned in their old age anymore.</p> <p>And this specific pledge to women, who have long been discriminated against because of the way the pension system works. </p> <p>For the first time you will be treated equally.</p> <p>For the first time you will have a pension in your own right.</p> <p>That's what the Liberal Democrats stand for.</p> <p>On health - We would put patients first and free doctors and nurses from Whitehall meddling. Liberal Democrats would hack away the red tape, abolish the absurd targets and free our frustrated doctors and nurses. </p> <p>Let the local community and the local doctors and local nurses make the decisions. They are far better placed to get them right. </p> <p>And more emphasis than ever before should be placed on prevention of ill health and promotion of healthy lifestyles. We truly need a health and not just a sickness service.</p> <p>That's what the Liberal Democrats stand for.</p> <p>On the environment - our determination to make the environment count at every level of Government means thinking green in every area.</p> <p>Yes, it's big picture stuff - from the food chain to climate change, energy to trade, aviation to sustainable international development.</p> <p>Britain can't do this alone. The Prime Minister is right to use our presidency of the EU and the G8 next year to press for consensus.</p> <p>But if we can lead by example, if we can achieve our Kyoto targets ahead of time, we can encourage other countries to sign up.</p> <p>If we can deliver 20% of our electricity needs through renewable energy by 2020, that would be leading by example.</p> <p>Take air travel - which is fast become the world's biggest polluter.</p> <p>We should be shifting taxes on aviation away from the passenger and onto the plane itself which does the polluting.</p> <p>Now that would be leading by example too, encouraging better fuel efficiency and therefore less pollution.</p> <p>But quality of life actually begins at home - it's in your street, around your community.</p> <p>And our approach to the environment must begin there too.</p> <p>The green thread that should run through all aspects of government, should run through all aspects of our lives also.</p> <p>So more park and ride schemes for our towns and cities - cutting pollution in our streets.</p> <p>More local recycling initiatives - showing how all of us can make that difference within our own homes.</p> <p>Cutting waste - reusing - improving.</p> <p>That's what the Liberal Democrats stand for.</p> <p>Freedom. Fairness. Trust.</p> <p>Because that's what these - and many more - policies are rooted in.</p> <p>Policies designed to create more freedom.</p> <p>Based on social fairness.</p> <p>Not bogus, false choices - designed to distract.</p> <p>But real, quality local choice - designed to deliver.</p> <p>And it's all underpinned by economic fairness as well.</p> <p>This is crucial to our credibility and critical to our success.</p> <p>From the outset, I have insisted that we have the most watertight set of tax and expenditure proposals possible. </p> <p>We want to tax more fairly and spend more wisely.</p> <p>Isn't it a disgrace that after 7 years of a supposedly Labour government the poorest 20% contribute more of their income in tax than do the richest 20%?</p> <p>We don't want the politics of economic envy. But we do want the politics of social equity.</p> <p>What does that mean?</p> <p>It means asking the top 1% of income earners to pay a top marginal rate of tax of 50p for every pound earned above \u00a3100,000. </p> <p>That pays for our immediate commitments to: </p> <p>* Scrap tuition and top-up fees for students;</p> <p>* Introduce free personal care for elderly and disabled people;</p> <p>* And keep down the level of local taxes.</p> <p>But spending on our priorities does not mean higher taxes across the board. It means looking hard as well at how much Government spends and getting value for money for taxpayers.</p> <p>And we've already found further large savings - at least \u00a35bn a year - by cutting back on big, centralised government and redirecting money to priority spending:</p> <p>\u00b7 Dropping plans for identity cards;</p> <p>\u00b7 Scrapping some government departments and relocating others away from high-cost central London;</p> <p>\u00b7 Doing less, better and more efficiently - and concentrating more on what really matters.</p> <p>It is this approach which gives us the credibility to pledge.</p> <p>\u00b7 Axing the \u00a31bn Child Trust Fund, the so called baby bonds scheme, and spending the money now when children need it most, not the state stashing it away until 2022;</p> <p>\u00b7 10,000 more police on the streets - cutting crime and the fear of crime;</p> <p>\u00b7 Making sure that by 2011 Britain finally fulfils its UN obligations by boosting the overseas aid budget to 0.7% of GNP;</p> <p>\u00b7 \u00a325 more on pensions every week for those aged 75 and over with a million pensioners taken off means testing.</p> <p>The figures add up; the balance sheet is balanced. </p> <p>Freedom. Fairness. Trust.</p> <p>It is trust that has to underpin everything else.</p> <p>And it's winning public trust that is going to be the biggest challenge of all.</p> <p>Over the course of this parliament one issue more than any other has helped define just what the Liberal Democrats stand for in the minds of millions of our fellow citizens.</p> <p>You know what I'm talking about.</p> <p>And the people know exactly what we've been talking about.</p> <p>From the outset we have provided rational, principled and consistent opposition to the war in Iraq.</p> <p>We've done it without exaggeration. We've done it without name-calling. We've done it - quite simply - because we believed it was the right thing to do.</p> <p>Now I believe the vast majority of people have made their minds up - one way or the other.</p> <p>Donald Rumsfeld promised shock and awe.</p> <p>What we got was shock and then steadily increasing horror. </p> <p>The Prime Minister promised action on the Middle East Road Map.</p> <p>What we got was little progress and more violence.</p> <p>There's a sullen, and increasingly angry mood on the issue. And understandably so.</p> <p>Not least when Kofi Annan declares the war illegal.</p> <p>When the Iraq Survey Group is expected to conclude that the WMD were not there.</p> <p>When the Foreign Office warned of the likely disastrous consequences.</p> <p>And when it appears the Government told the Bush administration, a full year before the war started, that it would not budge in its support for their policy of regime change - and yet the Prime Minister told our Parliament and our people that it was all about weapons of mass destruction.</p> <p>There is a fundamental question that the Prime Minister has consistently failed to answer.</p> <p>I asked him this in the House of Commons in the run up to war, and again as recently as the 20th of July this year during the debate on the Butler Report.</p> <p>\"Did he advise President Bush privately - long before the United Nations route was formally abandoned - that if the President decided to prosecute an invasion of Iraq, the British would be in active military support, come what may?</p> <p>\"If he did advise the President to that effect, when did such an exchange take place?\"</p> <p>When Parliament next convenes, the Prime Minister must take the first opportunity to come to the Despatch Box and make a full statement. </p> <p>It's time we got an answer. </p> <p>And if the Prime Minister still refuses, the people can make a judgement.</p> <p>There is the ultimate verdict of the general election itself.</p> <p>Lord Hutton did not provide the answer.</p> <p>Nor did Lord Butler.</p> <p>The decision to decline to participate in Lord Butler's enquiry was a tough one at the time.</p> <p>But it was the correct decision as events have proved.</p> <p>And at the end of the day that is what trust in political leadership has to be all about.</p> <p>What trust today in what our leaders told us at the time about Iraq?</p> <p>And what kind of corrosive effect does that have on politics generally?</p> <p>Yet the tragic experience of Iraq should have the opposite effect.</p> <p>And I believe it can.</p> <p>It should galvanise people to participate, to make their views known through the ballot box.</p> <p>It should strengthen all of our resolves to rededicate ourselves to the rebuilding of effective international institutions, to the repairing of shattered alliances among long-standing friends.</p> <p>But within our own country - one lesson must be learned.</p> <p>This country is still crying out for an effective political system that responds to them and listens to the people.</p> <p>More openness. More accountability. Politicians taking responsibility for their decisions.</p> <p>Never again must this country be led into war on the basis of questionable intelligence.</p> <p>Never again must this country be sold an incomplete and false prospectus as a basis for unilateral military action without the sanction of the United Nations.</p> <p>Never again must Britain find itself on such a basis so distanced from principal partners within Europe.</p> <p>Never again should our troops find themselves without proper and adequate equipment in a war zone.</p> <p>Never again should such supreme Prime Ministerial power be allowed to progress without sufficient checks and balances.</p> <p>And without the proper operation of collective Cabinet government itself.</p> <p>And never again should a so-called \"official opposition\" be entitled to that name when it so pathetically fails to fulfil its most basic parliamentary function and duty - the provision of constructive and effective questioning of the executive of the day.</p> <p>Never again.</p> <p>But we should not just look back in anger.</p> <p>There is every sign that we need to look forward with increasing anxiety.</p> <p>And that is why the Prime Minister should also take that opportunity to give a cast iron guarantee that the United Kingdom will not support unilateral military action against Iran.</p> <p>You know some commentators will tell you that our recent victories are just the fall out from Iraq.</p> <p>That the Lib Dems are just the protest vote.</p> <p>Well, let's face it. There has been a lot for people to protest about.</p> <p>But we are being seen more and more as a party which does win elections, which does exercise responsible representation, which has become increasingly comfortable with the duties and the disciplines of power.</p> <p>Some also say that you can't go chasing left-wing voters and right-wing voters at one and the same time - while remaining consistent and true to your principles.</p> <p>It is a deeply flawed analysis - based on a fundamental misreading of today's Britain.</p> <p>Why? Because for the vast majority of people who live their lives in an increasingly inter-dependent world, facing increasingly complex issues, for them the old-fashioned nostrums of right and left no longer apply.</p> <p>They're looking for solution-based politics. Politics which address their everyday needs.</p> <p>There is a shift in the way people view politics, one that transcends any single issue.</p> <p>Iraq has been part of this, but by no means is it the whole story.</p> <p>I come across it, day in and day out.</p> <p>People see that the Labour and Conservative agendas are converging.</p> <p>Where as ours is about having the freedom to make the most of our lives.</p> <p>It's about what is fair - taxation based on ability to pay and delivery for all not the few.</p> <p>And that you have to be able to trust your political leaders and your political parties to deliver.</p> <p>There's a deep-rooted sense in our country that somehow all is not quite right.</p> <p>That somehow all is not as we're being told it is. An underlying sense of doubt.</p> <p>Made worse by the fact that people just don't trust this Government.</p> <p>This Government flags up the big, long-term difficult issues - pension provision, funding local services, global warming - but then puts off serious discussion and decisions until safely beyond another general election.</p> <p>But people don't identify with the Conservatives - because that party just doesn't connect with them.</p> <p>They hark back to a Britain that is no more. They're out of touch with the Britain of today.</p> <p>No wonder they fall back on hard-core instincts - and increasingly belongs to all our yesterdays. </p> <p>In huge swathes of the country it's the Conservatives who are now firmly established - as the third party.</p> <p>In so much of the country a vote for the Conservatives is now a wasted vote.</p> <p>The third party - on their third leader in as many years - and a third leader who's just had his third reshuffle in less than a year.</p> <p>Well, they say variety is the spice of life.</p> <p>For the Conservatives it looks to me much more like the kiss of death.</p> <p>They belong to the past. </p> <p>We're working for the future.</p> <p>We are moving from a party of protest to a party of power.</p> <p>3 party politics is here - and here to stay.</p> <p>You know, at times this past year I've felt rather nostalgic.</p> <p>21 years as a Member of Parliament.</p> <p>You learn quite a lot after more than two decades doing any job.</p> <p>Direct personal experience does teach along the way.</p> <p>That's why, whenever I'm asked to speculate - an occupational hazard - I always suggest to people not to waste time on the crystal ball, but instead learn from the history book. </p> <p>It's really quite simple.</p> <p>For the country to believe in a political party - first that party has to believe in itself. </p> <p>We're at our best, we perform best, we persuade best - when we spend our time talking positively about what it is that we have to offer.</p> <p>And we're far more likely to achieve that from a position of principled party independence - not one distracted by noises off.</p> <p>So when people ask me \"Where does your party stand?\" my starting point is not the crystal ball.</p> <p>Instead, it's crystal clear.</p> <p>No nods, no winks, no deals, no stitch ups.</p> <p>If, on polling day at next general election, more people vote Liberal Democrat - then the next day and in the next parliament what you will get are more Liberal Democrats working for more liberal democracy.</p> <p>Not something else.</p> <p>But working all out for better public policies from parliament.</p> <p>Prepared to work with others on issues of principle - like Europe.</p> <p>But not prepared to surrender our essential political independence along the way.</p> <p>That's our Liberal Democrat pledge to the people. </p> <p> So there is a fundamental choice before us all at the next General Election.</p> <p>The British people have probably not more than 225 days left to choose between two essentially conservative parties - and the real alternative which is the Liberal Democrats.</p> <p>225 days.</p> <p>Then a stark choice.

  "President Bush held an hour-long meeting with Pakistan's president, Pervez Musharraf, in New York yesterday, in talks dominated by the campaign to overwhelm al-Qaida and Taliban fighters along the porous Pakistan-Afghanistan border. <p>General Musharraf is an important US ally in its \"war on terror\" and Washington has softened rhetoric urging the military ruler to restore democracy after his 1999 seizure of power. </p> <p>In yesterday's talks, Mr Bush briefly touched on the general's decision to retain military as well as political control in Pakistan beyond the end of the year, a move that flouts a previous commitment. </p> <p>A US official said the president had tried to nudge Pakistan into \"moving forward with democratic institutions,\" but did not press Mr Musharraf to keep his promise. </p> <p>Instead, the exchange focused on Islamabad's efforts to root out al-Qaida and Taliban elements in the remote tribal areas along the border with Afghanistan. Some 200 Pakistani forces have been killed in an offensive that started about a year ago. </p> <p>At least one Pakistani paramilitary member was killed by suspected militants in an attack on a convoy there yesterday. </p> <p>The two leaders also talked about how to stamp out the last remnants of the network of Abdul Qadeer Khan, the disgraced founder of Pakistan's nuclear weapons programme, who admitted in February to passing nuclear technology to other countries. </p> <p>But Mr Bush did not press Mr Musharraf to allow US agents to interview Dr Khan, a point of contention for the Americans.</p>",
  "Charles Kennedy today declared that the Liberal Democrats were the \"winning choice\" as he warned conference delegates they were probably only 225 days away from the next general election. <p>The Lib Dem leader avoided mentioning either Tony Blair or Michael Howard by name, but declared, as predicted, that a vote for the Conservatives was now a \"wasted vote\" and that there would be \"no deals, no stitch ups\" to share power with Labour in the event of a hung parliament.</p> <p>Reflecting the confident mood of the party after five days of a Bournemouth conference noticeably devoid of rows or controversy, Mr Kennedy declared: \"Three-party politics is here to stay. We are moving from a party of protest to a party of power.\"</p> <p>In a mark of respect to British hostage in Iraq, Kenneth Bigley, a planned US-style balloon drop at the end of Mr Kennedy's speech was cancelled, as party officials admitted the crisis in Iraq was a \"shadow over the conference\".</p> <p>In an ad-libbed opening to his conference address, Mr Kennedy said Mr Bigley was in \"the forefront of all our minds, and all right, sane and civilised people around the world\".</p> <p>He also scrapped some scripted opening remarks poking fun at himself for his new exercise regime.</p> <p>Mr Kennedy immediately left Bournemouth to campaign in Hartlepool, where candidate Jody Dunn will be fighting next Thursday's byelection, flown by his party's Welsh spokesman Lembit Opik - despite the party's opposition to short-haul aviation.</p> <p>Buoyed up by polls showing the party is now at 26% - twice its rating in the run-up to the 2001 general election - Mr Kennedy said the Tories now belonged to the past, and that the third Conservative leader in three years was \"the kiss of death\".</p> <p>Turning to Labour, Mr Kennedy repeated his claim that after Iraq, \"people just don't trust this government\".</p> <p>He demanded that as soon as parliament returns, Mr Blair should come to the House of Commons and make a full statement on whether, as some have alleged, he made a private pact with the US president, George Bush, to invade Iraq, no matter the result of diplomacy at the UN.</p> <p>Although Mr Kennedy, and most of his party, have stopped short of demanding Mr Blair's resignation or impeachment, he said: \"If the prime minister still refuses, the people can make a judgement.</p> <p>\"There is the ultimate verdict of the general election itself.\"</p> <p>He pointed to the party's local election wins in Liverpool, Newcastle, Swansea and Cardiff; the power-sharing coalition in Edinburgh; and the achievements of the previous Labour-Lib Dem coalition in Wales. </p> <p>But he insisted there would be no deals at Westminster. He told delegates: \"No nods, no winks, no deals, no stitch ups.\"</p> <p>Earlier, party officials made it clear that this was a categorical rejection of a coalition with Labour after the next election.</p> <p>Mr Kennedy instead told activists not to \"waste time on the crystal ball, but instead learn from the history book\". </p> <p>\"For a country to believe in a political party - first that party has to believe in itself,\" he said.</p> <p>With the party having voted virtually unanimously to approve the \"mini-manifesto\" ahead of the campaigning season, Mr Kennedy ran through the main selling points of Lib Dem policies: scrapping the council tax, abolishing tuition fees, 10,000 extra police officers, a 50p tax rate on people earning over \u00a3100,000 a year and scrapping most NHS targets.</p> <p>He said his party's \"watchwords\" were now \"freedom, fairness, trust\".</p> <p> One issue that failed to make it into the speech was the European constitution and the single currency - both of which Labour have pledged referendums on.</p> <p>Earlier this morning, new party president Simon Hughes - elected in the summer after his unsuccessful London mayoral campaign - said he would be abandoning dinners with party constituencies in favour of \"spending less time talking to ourselves and more time talking to others\".</p> <p>He told delegates: \"My job is to put our case to the unconverted, not the converted.</p> <p>With Lib Dem strategists saying privately that they expect a May 5 election, the party is working to an eight-month countdown - although officials are always careful to avoid putting a figure on the number of seats they expect to add to their current tally of 55 MPs.</p> <p>Mr Hughes told activists there were no \"no-go areas\" for the Lib Dems - unlike either Labour or the Tories.</p>",
  "<p>As he gears up for Labour's Brighton conference and the coming election campaign after another bruising year, David Blunkett is in fighting form, even by his own pugnacious standards. He likens himself to a frigate protecting Tony Blair's precious convoy of MPs seeking re-election.</p> <p>On the need to stand firm against terrorism in Iraq, he admits that \"it has divided the country, families and the Labour party. When I sit down to eat with friends, they disagree with me.\" </p> <p>But Mr Blair is an Iraq faintheart in comparison with his home secretary. The enemy \"are against everything we stand for and, were they to win, they would come for us - not with weapons of mass destruction, but with suicide bombers, with ricin and with the kind of weaponry al-Qaida use,\" Mr Blunkett will tell next week's party conference. </p> <p>Mr Blunkett says that things are getting better in Britain, but that many people cannot see it. He cites the revival of community spirit and activity in his working-class constituency of Sheffield Brightside; partly due to Labour's regeneration programmes, partly to growing self-confidence among people that they can make a difference. </p> <p>\"Iraq is the cloud that has resulted in people raising their umbrellas,\" he says. \"And when you have an umbrella over your head, it is sometimes difficult to feel the sun coming through. So we do need to address that domestic agenda, and I think you will find the prime minister will do just that next Tuesday in Brighton\". </p> <p>At the end of his interview on the red sofas in his office high above St James's Park, Mr Blunkett declares himself \"full of vitality, energy and drive.\" </p> <p>\"In the general election, I am going to be the frigate that takes the Tory fire - now they have gone back into their ideological bunker and concentrated on my area of work - so that the convoy forges on to victory. I am very happy to do that,\" he says. </p> <p>For a self-styled law-and-order populist who loves nothing better than to tease what he calls \"the liberal left\" intelligentsia (the people who never give a Labour government the benefit of the doubt, he says), Mr Blunkett describes himself as being tough in order to deliver \"good progressive things.\" </p> <p>\"I am the first home secretary in 100 years who has been able to sort out out sexual offences laws,\" Mr Blunkett says. </p> <p>Though he does not spell it out, he is referring to the divisive national trauma that followed Oscar Wilde's conviction and imprisonment in 1895, and which frightened politicians off reform for decades. It is a bold claim for an MP who initially voted against equalisation of the age of consent, but one made with characteristic conviction. </p> <p>And while he is on the subject, did he not this week release \"D\", the Algerian terrorist suspect held for two years? </p> <p>\"You don't want people incarcerated for ever, and you should review the evidence ... As for whether he should be removed [from Britain], I have taken the view that it would be wrong to return people to certain death. I wouldn't mind a bit of acknowledgement from the liberal left on that, either.\"</p> <p>The declared purpose of Mr Blunkett's interview is to emphasise that \"there has to be a third-term vision that does not simply say, 'This is what we have done. Give us a third term.' There has to be a vision of another kind of politics\" - one which Mr Blair, Mr Brown and he can all work towards. </p> <p>The key word in Mr Blunkett's analysis is security: what people need if they are to \"overcome alienation and disengagement. That's quite a challenge. People are disengaged because the world has changed so rapidly ... that change causes greater insecurity and fearfulness, which reinforces alienation from both the process of politics and from coping with change.\" </p> <p>He sees the need for a three-stranded narrative, to link the economic security that Mr Brown has been sustaining, neighbourhood security (a mixture of revived community empowerment and tough anti-crime measures), and the global security that Mr Blair is battling to develop. </p> <p>He argues forcefully that the terrorist threat has raised \"subliminal fears\" among voters that they are less secure; and that a combination of the global information network and the universality of English have made people fear a flood of migrants. </p> <p>By allowing citizens of new eastern European EU member states to openly \"register, work and pay taxes\" - instead of working clandestinely, as in most EU countries - Mr Blunkett claims to have disproved such predictions of a \"flood\". </p> <p>\"I had to hold my nerve in April because the media pressures were enormous. I am never going to satisfy the rightwing zealots,\" he says. But he also regrets that there are some people \"never reflecting whether they were right or wrong, who never go back and say, 'Was what we said at the time a load of garbage?'\" </p> <p>At moments like this, Mr Blunkett's angrier side emerges. It is clear that personal attacks hurt, and he protects his private life and private feelings very closely. They are not up for discussion in any form, though when an aide removes a curious wooden statue which will otherwise stick out of the home secretary's head in Dan Chung's photograph, he thanks him. \"I can do without any phallic symbols.\" </p> <p>But his optimism soon reasserts itself. When MPs actually discuss the details of anti-terrorist legislation, they always have a \"sensible thoughtful debate\" which goes unreported, he says. </p> <p>In one extraordinary comparison, he likens his inability to answer criticism over the terms of terror suspects' detention to the silence enforced on the Labour prime minister Clement Attlee after he and his inner cabinet secretly sanctioned the building of a British hydrogen bomb in the late 40s. </p> <p>\"I have to live with that, just as, when Churchill accused Attlee of not engaging with the H-bomb, Attlee was not able to say before the 1951 election, 'We are doing it.'\" </p> <p>It is not a comparison that will cheer all Labour veterans.</p>",
  "Welcome to the Wrap, Guardian Unlimited's round-up of the best of the day's papers. <p>Also in today's Wrap: The Lib Dems' party conference, John Kerry in fighting mood and Cat Stevens as terror threat</p> <p><b>'MR BLAIR, I DON'T WANT TO DIE'</b></p> <p>For once, all the main morning newspapers lead with the same story and, in many cases, the same headline. A video appeal from British hostage Kenneth Bigley to Tony Blair was last night posted on an Islamist website. \"I need you to help me now, Mr Blair, because you are the only person on God's earth who can,\" reads the Times headline, quoting Mr Bigley verbatim.</p> <p>The Guardian places Mr Bigley's words against a fuzzy image of him from the video in which he is wearing an orange jumpsuit. The paper said he \"appeared composed, but there was desperation in his voice\".</p> <p>An announcement from the Iraqi government yesterday that at least one prominent female prisoner, Rihab Taha, a biological weapons scientist, would be released was countermanded by the US, which is holding her, and appears to have shut off Mr Bigley's one glimmer of hope.</p> <p>The Telegraph's report suggests the video was an attempt to drive a wedge between Britain and the US, and between the coalition and the Iraqi interim government. Its leader column argues there should be no surrender to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of the group holding Mr Bigley and, it is believed, the man who personally beheaded his two fellow US captives.</p> <p>\"It is not easy for the prime minister to tell the country that he is powerless to save the life of a British hostage,\" the paper says. \"That, alas, is the case [...] it would be cruel as well as false for him to imply that anything he might do or say could have the least influence on the closed minds of the terrorists.\"</p> <p>The Financial Times says that the \"grim horror\" of the daily news from Iraq will frustrate Mr Blair's attempts to focus on a domestic agenda at next week's Labour party conference, and the Independent adds that Labour's private polling suggests Mr Blair's Iraq policy could cost it 3m votes at the next general election. Seamus Milne, writing in the Guardian's comment pages, suggests that Labour should use its conference to vote for a troop withdrawal \"to begin to undo the damage to itself and lay the ground for change in Iraq [...] It is now clear that there will be no security in Iraq while US and British forces remain.\"</p> <p>The Times adds that another Islamist group last night claimed the murder of two Italian aid workers, Simona Toretta and Simona Pari.

  "When President George Bush addressed the general assembly in September 2002, he told the United Nations it was in danger of becoming \"irrelevant\" unless it confronted Iraq. It didn't, and it isn't. Two years later, and the UN's continuing relevancy was confirmed by a more restrained Mr Bush on Tuesday. As the Los Angeles Times put it, Mr Bush \"didn't quite break out in Esperanto\" at UN headquarters, but he did take a much more diplomatic approach than his earlier appearance. He was careful to heap praise on the work of UN personnel on the ground in Iraq, as well as on Nato for helping to train Iraqi troops. <p>Naturally, with more than an eye on the looming presidential election, Mr Bush's speech was studded with references to his administration's perceived successes. But there was still no hint from Mr Bush that the US's attempts to bully the UN into supporting an invasion of Iraq - by exaggerating and embellishing the existence of weapons of mass destruction - deserved an explanation or apology. His claim that fighting in Iraq means \"peaceful nations will never have to face [terrorists] within our own borders\" will sound savagely hollow to the people of Spain and Indonesia. Tellingly, Mr Bush's attempt to maintain that the US acted to support UN resolutions was coolly dismissed by Kofi Annan, the UN secretary general, who told the assembly: \"Those who invoke international law must themselves submit to it.\" </p> <p>Nonetheless, Mr Bush's speech contained little of the crude unilateralism that his campaigning exhibits, nor the cheap smears at John Kerry's policy of greater engagement with the international community as a sign of weakness and capitulation. In an interesting twist, while Mr Bush was vainly trying to win friends at the UN, Mr Kerry was continuing his assault on Mr Bush's record in Iraq, which the Democrat challenger branded as \"colossal failures in judgment\". At last, as the drip-drip of bad news from Iraq turns into a torrent, Mr Kerry's decision to tackle Mr Bush head-on over Iraq promises to ignite the presidential campaign in its final weeks. </p> <p>So far, the Bush campaign has been largely successful in entwining the threat of terrorism with Saddam Hussein's regime in the minds of many US voters. Mr Kerry's job is first to separate the two issues, and then hold Mr Bush to account for the series of errors and falsehoods that led towards invasion, and the disastrous lack of planning for administering and rebuilding post-Saddam Iraq. There is a risk that Mr Kerry won't be able to pull it off, and the Bush campaign will again paint him as a \"flip-flopper\". But the tide of bad news is such that Mr Bush's vision of Iraq being rapidly transformed into Texas-on-the-Euphrates is the stuff of fantasy. The more Mr Kerry can press Mr Bush on his record and his inchoate plans for Iraq, the better for his chances, and possibly for the people of Iraq - who may not have a vote but certainly have an interest in the outcome. </p> <p>Another person with an interest in the outcome is Tony Blair, who is now in what management consultants call a \"lose-lose\" position. A Kerry victory based on attacking Mr Bush's mismanagement of Iraq leaves Mr Blair friendless in Washington and open to the same attacks on this side of the Atlantic. But a Bush victory will surely be no better for Mr Blair, since he will remain shackled to his uncomfortable ally, and continue to endure the stream of hostage-taking, civilian deaths and descent into violence that the past few months have seen in Iraq. Mr Bush has given no sense of a meaningful exit strategy, other than the increasingly untenable plans for an election in January. Should Mr Bush be re-elected, the chances are for greater violence in Iraq, not less. This is the worst of all possible worlds for Mr Blair: whoever wins in November, he loses.</p>",
  "The news is grim, but the president is \"optimistic\". The intelligence is sobering, but he tosses aside \"pessimistic predictions\". His opponent says he has \"no credibility\", but the president replies that it is his rival who is \"twisting in the wind\". The UN secretary general speaks of the \"rule of law\", but he talks before a mute general assembly of \"a new definition of security\". Between the rhetoric and the reality lies the campaign. <p>In Iraq, US commanders have plans for this week and the next, but there is \"no overarching strategy\", I was told by a reliable source who has just returned after assessing the facts on the ground for US intelligence services. The New York Times reports that an offensive is in the works to capture the insurgent stronghold of Falluja - after the election. In the meantime, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi and other terrorists linked to al-Qaida operate from there at will, as they have for more than a year. The president speaks of new Iraqi security forces, but not even half the US personnel have been assigned to the headquarters of the Multinational Security Transition Command. </p> <p>George Bush's vision of the liberation of Iraq has melted before harsh facts. But reality cannot be allowed to obscure the image. The liberation is \"succeeding\", he insists, and only pessimists cannot see it. </p> <p>In July, the CIA delivered to the president a new national intelligence estimate that detailed three gloomy scenarios for Iraq's future, ranging up to civil war. Perhaps it was his reading of the estimate that prompted Bush to remark in August that the war on terrorism could not be won, a judgment he swiftly reversed. And at the UN, Bush held a press conference where he rebuffed the latest intelligence. </p> <p> Bush explained that, for him, intelligence is not to inform decision-making, but to be used or rejected to advance an ideological and political agenda. His dismissal is an affirmation of the politicisation and corruption of intelligence that rationalised the war. </p> <p>In his stump speech, which he repeats word for word across the country, Bush explains that he invaded Iraq because of \"the lesson of September the 11th\". WMD goes unmentioned; the only reason Bush offers is Saddam Hussein as an agent of terrorism. \"He was a sworn enemy of the United States of America; he had ties to terrorist networks. Do you remember Abu Nidal? He's the guy that killed Leon Klinghoffer. Leon Klinghoffer was murdered because of his religion. Abu Nidal was in Baghdad, as was his organisation.\" </p> <p>The period of Leon Klinghoffer's murder in 1985 on the liner Achille Lauro (by Abu Abbas, in fact) coincided with the US courtship of Saddam, marked by the celebrated visits of then Middle East envoy Donald Rumsfeld. The US collaborated in intelligence exchanges and materially supported Saddam in his war with Iran, authorising the sale of biological agents for Saddam's laboratories, a diversification of his WMD capability. </p> <p>The reason was not born of idealism, but necessity: the threat of an expansive Iran-controlled Shia fundamentalism to the entire Gulf. </p> <p>The policy of courting Saddam continued until he invaded Kuwait. But realpolitik prevailed when US forces held back from capturing Baghdad for larger, geostrategic reasons. The first Bush grasped that in wars to come, the US would need ad hoc coalitions to share the military burden and financial cost. Taking Baghdad would have violated the UN resolution that gave legitimacy to the first Gulf war, as well as creating a nightmare of \"Lebanonisation\", as secretary of state James Baker called it. Realism prevailed; Saddam's power was subdued and drastically reduced. It was the greatest accomplishment of the first President Bush. </p> <p>When he honoured the UN resolution, the credibility of the US in the region was enormously enhanced, enabling serious movement on the Middle East peace process. Now this President Bush has undone the foundation of his father's work, which was built upon by President Clinton. </p> <p>Bush's campaign depends on the containment of any contrary perception of reality. He must evade, deny and suppress it. His true opponent is not his Democratic foe - called unpatriotic and the candidate of al-Qaida by the vice-president - but events. Bush's latest vision is his shield against them. He invokes the power of positive thinking, as taught by Emile Coue, guru of autosuggestion in the giddy 1920s, who urged mental improvement through constant repetition: \"Every day in every way I am getting better and better.\" </p> <p>It was during this era of illusion that TS Eliot wrote The Hollow Men: Between the idea/ And the reality/ Between the motion/ And the act/ Falls the Shadow.\" </p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>Sidney Blumenthal, a former senior adviser to President Clinton, is Washington bureau chief of salon.com </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:sidney_blumenthal@ yahoo.com\">sidney_blumenthal@ yahoo.com</a></p>",
  "<b> New York Times</b> Editorial, September 22 <br>\"We did not expect President George Bush to come before the United Nations [on Tuesday] in the middle of his re-election campaign and acknowledge the serious mistakes his administration has made on Iraq. But that still left plenty of room for him to take advantage of this one last chance to appeal to an increasingly antagonistic world to help the Iraqis secure and rebuild their shattered nation and prepare for elections in just four months. Instead, Mr Bush delivered an inexplicably defiant campaign speech in which he glossed over the current dire situation in Iraq for an audience acutely aware of the true state of affairs, and scolded them for refusing to endorse the American invasion ... <p>\"Mr Bush might have done better at wooing broader international support if he had spent less time on self-justification and scolding and more on praising the importance of international cooperation and a strengthened UN.

America needs more international support than it is getting, in Iraq and elsewhere.\" </p> <p><b> Los Angeles Times</b> Editorial, September 22 <br>\"Mr Bush's continued refusal to accept that international cooperation means more than doing what Washington orders has made others reluctant to step in. </p> <p>\"Without a change in strategy and tactics by the administration, Iraq will be an unavoidable Topic A at the president's annual UN speech again next year, with little likelihood of a more stable and secure nation, or world. Mr Bush offered a finely crafted speech and admirably hopeful phrases. Unfortunately, kind words can't erase past slurs - or current ones out on the campaign trail - against the UN and 'Old Europe', and hope is not enough to change the disaster on the ground.\" </p> <p><b> Daily News</b> Editorial, New York, September 22 <br> \"Mr Bush ... did not come to the UN to talk to his fellow excellencies and potentates. When he has an important message for one of them, he picks up the phone. [On Tuesday], they were TV extras ... The speech was a slap at John Kerry, who at NYU [a day earlier] called the war in Iraq a 'profound diversion' and a 'colossal failure of judgment' ... The president was merciless. 'The proper response to difficulty is not to retreat,' he told the general assembly. 'It is to prevail.' </p> <p>\"The UN audience greeted this stirring sentiment with total silence. Most of the diplomats in the house represent governments that are rooting for a US defeat in Iraq. But Mr Bush couldn't have cared less. He was talking to America, where most voters are on the American side.\" </p> <p><b> Boston Globe</b> Editorial, September 22 <br> \"Mr Bush offered a paean to human dignity and the advance of freedom that was directed less to the heads of government and diplomats in the audience than to US voters. It was a speech truffled with his campaign themes. He came out firmly for freedom and democracy and against tyranny, corruption, and the murder of children by ruthless terrorists ... On Iraq, Mr Bush merely reiterated the same justifications he had given in the past for toppling Saddam Hussein without authorisation from the UN ... </p> <p>\"If Mr Bush had wanted to tell the truth at the UN, he would have acknowledged that his blinkered statecraft, as Mr Kerry put it, has 'divided our friends and united our enemies'. Mr Kerry has correctly criticised the 'stubborn incompetence' that has weakened the US and led it to the verge of calamity in Iraq. But Mr Kerry needs to do a better job of explaining what he would do - beyond what Mr Bush is already trying to do - to rescue Iraq and America from the calamity Mr Bush has been creating.\" </p> <p><b> New York Post</b> Editorial, September 22 <br>\"If even just half of the 'esteemed' VIPs at the UN shared the values espoused by Mr Bush in his speech ... the world would be immensely safer - and better. Alas, they don't. Indeed, as Americans know, Turtle Bay is riddled with despots and double-crossers, conmen and cowards. An odd lot - but one with which ... Mr Kerry seeks to cast an alliance ... </p> <p>\"Spreading freedom carries a cost, Mr Bush said. But, he argued, it also 'is the path to both a safer and better world'. Yet Mr Kerry instantly jumped into Kofi Annan's boat, arguing that Mr Bush 'has no credibility with foreign leaders'. He couldn't have gotten it more backward: many foreign leaders - in, say, France or Germany - have no standing when it comes to global security. They - and John Kerry - can learn much from George Bush.\"</p>",
  "Even though Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono will almost certainly have an insurmountable lead in the Indonesian presidential election by the time you read this, many of the plaudits in the papers were initially directed at the 155 million registered voters, for their mostly orderly and honest behaviour in what was the country's first direct presidential ballot on Monday. <p>\"The people's victory\" was the way the Jakarta evening paper <b>Suara Pembaruan</b> yesterday hailed the country's maturing democratic process. \"It is only now that we feel a sovereign people,\" it said. \"Until now our voices were always represented by the People's Consultative Assembly in choosing the president. We didn't know if they really represented us. This election was truly a victory for the little people.\" </p> <p>It went on, as did many papers, to praise President Megawati Sukarnoputri for allowing the voting process to become genuinely democratic. The <b>Media Indonesia</b> daily praised her \"golden work\". It said: \"Mega has taken the initiative, fully realising that it is very likely that she would be defeated.\" </p> <p>Much of the analysis focused on the scale of Ms Megawati's defeat (expected to be about 61% to 39%). The <b>Jakarta Post</b> blamed \"a culture of permissiveness that ... has been spreading, not only [in her] Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle, but throughout the important agencies of the government.\" </p> <p>Then there were Ms Megawati's intellectual failings. \"The organised dialogue of the presidential candidates last week, televised nationwide, showed in an embarrassing manner that Ms Megawati simply could not fathom the questions posed to her,\" said the Post. </p> <p>The Jakarta daily <b>Sinar Harapan</b> warned Mr Yudhoyono to avoid Ms Megawati's \"main\" mistake. \"She didn't effectively communicate to the people the government's successes and targets that had yet to be met,\" it said. </p> <p>Indonesia's largest newspaper, <b>Kompas</b>, picked up on the buoyant mood with an editorial headlined \"Don't let this momentum fail again\", a reference to the unfulfilled reform programmes of the last two presidencies. But it advised people not to elevate their hopes too high, \"because much hard work will be needed to translate our hopes into real accomplishments\".</p>",
  "The price paid by Britain for Tony Blair's decision to join the invasion of Iraq has until now been relatively low. British casualties have been proportionately fewer than those of the Americans. By occupying the Shia-dominated south, British troops were at least initially spared the scale of guerrilla attacks that greeted US forces from the first days. Few Britons had until this week been caught up in the kidnappings sweeping Iraq and, despite dire government warnings, Britain has so far been spared the kind of revenge attack suffered, for example, by Spain - which Blair was told to expect in intelligence briefings in the run-up to war. <p>Now all that is changing. Since the start of Moqtada al-Sadr's insurrection last April, resistance has mushroomed across the south. In recent weeks British forces have been under regular assault, caught up in bloody firefights and forced back to barracks by the increase in attacks in Basra, Amara and elsewhere. Evidence has been piling up of the killing and maltreatment of Iraqis in and out of custody by British troops, whose local reputation for brutality is a far cry from the benign paternalism often hailed in the British media. And now a British engineer working at a US military base faces the horrific fate meted out to his two fellow American kidnap victims, who were apparently decapitated in person by the Jordanian jihadist, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, said to be linked to al-Qaida. </p> <p>Zarqawi and his tactics are opposed by much of the mainstream Iraqi national resistance, which now shows every sign of enjoying commanding popular support among Iraq's Arab population. But the attention he has attracted only serves to highlight the forces that have been unleashed by the Anglo-American war. </p> <p>Until last year, the only group in Iraq linked to al-Qaida operated in the US- and British-patrolled Kurdish area, beyond Saddam Hussein's writ. Now every Afghan jihadist veteran who wants to can stage kidnappings and suicide attacks throughout Iraq: this is Tony Blair's \"cockpit of international terrorism\", conjured into being by his own government. And as the quisling prime minister Ayad Allawi - whose real authority can be measured by the US veto of any release of the Iraqi women prisoners demanded by Kenneth Bigley's kidnappers - declared at the weekend: \"If Iraq is broken, London will be a target.\" </p> <p>The kidnapping of Kenneth Bigley may yet bring home the Iraq war to Britain in a way that months of TV footage of mayhem and misery have failed to do. The focus on his plight has, of course, been in stark contrast to the utter disinterest in the circumstances in which 300 Iraqis have been killed - most by US forces, many of them civilians - in the past week. But there still remains a sense of unreality in public life about the enormity of what Britain has helped to create in Iraq: a \"crisis of historic proportions\", in the words of the US Democratic challenger, John Kerry. </p> <p>By any normal reckoning, the events of the past few days should have triggered a political crisis in Britain. The conclusion of the Iraq Survey Group that there were no weapons of mass destruction at the time of the invasion, the leaked Whitehall documents confirming that Blair was warned in advance of the likelihood of post-war chaos and, crucially, the declaration by the UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, that the war launched by a British prime minister was illegal should be a lethal combination. </p> <p>The implications, after all, could not be more damning. If Saddam had no weapons of mass destruction by the late 1990s, as is now almost universally accepted, Iraq was evidently not in material breach of UN resolutions. If the war was illegal, as is now believed by most global opinion, then the only people fighting legitimately in Iraq are the resistance groups defending their homeland - not the forces of states that committed an international crime by attacking a country without provocation. That is the war still being fought out on the streets of Baghdad, Basra, Falluja and Ramadi - a war now so discredited that Blair is desperate to redefine it as a \"new conflict\" against terror. </p> <p>That these events have not yet led to a decisive crisis of Blair's leadership is above all a function of the fact that Britain was the only one of the original invading coalition to have a centre-left government - and which has therefore been supported over the fundamentals of the war ever since by the main opposition party. But the underlying damage to both the Labour party and the government by their continuing association with such a catastrophic adventure is likely to have fatal political consequences in its impact on public trust and support. The issue of the Iraq war must obviously transcend the bread-and-butter domestic concerns of British politics. That is not only because of the tens of thousands of innocents who have been killed, but because of the hugely dangerous precedent it has set in international relations and the threat it has created to the security of British citizens. </p> <p> F ortunately for the Labour party, a change of policy on Iraq - and the holding of the leadership that launched the war to account - is not only right in principle, but also in Labour's own interests. Next week, the party's annual conference in Brighton could start that process by voting for an early withdrawal of British troops. It is likely to be the party's last chance before the election - short of a change of leader - to begin to undo the damage to itself and lay the ground for change in Iraq. The omens for a withdrawal vote were yesterday not looking that good. The party machine can deploy all manner of tricks to avoid an embarrassing defeat - and so moribund is much of Labour's grassroots organisation that constituency delegates may not be representative of Labour opinion - let alone the 71% of the public who want a date for the withdrawal of British troops. </p> <p>Some will genuinely believe that, even if the invasion was wrong, withdrawal now would only lead to worse chaos or civil war. That is of course the traditional colonial alibi used to justify occupations, but in the case of Iraq - where most of its people say they want foreign troops to leave now - the argument is more than usually unconvincing. Violence and insecurity are already rampant and significant areas of the country have slipped out of the occupiers' control. Only Iraqis can create a stable future for themselves and it is now clear that there will be no security in Iraq while US and British forces remain. Any elections held under the auspices of the occupier - as are planned for January - will lack the legitimacy to calm the resistance. But what they could do is provide a face-saving context for a negotiated British withdrawal - which could in turn help shift US opinion about the value of its own occupation. What is needed next week is for Labour's conference to speak for Britain - and Iraq. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:s.milne@theguardian.com\">s.milne@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Before Fahrenheit 9/11, before Bowling for Columbine, the star of one of Michael Moore's most notorious stunts was a pancreas. <p>A patient who needed an organ transplant found that his health insurance company refused to cover the cost of the operation - until Moore staged and televised a mock funeral for him outside the company's offices. </p> <p>Now, the film-maker has reportedly won a financing and distribution deal for a movie developing that theme into a full-scale attack on America's healthcare system, provisionally entitled Sicko. </p> <p>The content of Fahrenheit 9/11 made distributors nervous about taking it on, until Harvey Weinstein, the head of Miramax, stepped in and assembled a partnership of studios specifically to market the film. </p> <p>After the success of that film, Miramax did not hesitate this time, according to the Hollywood trade journal Variety. </p> <p>\"I think the American people are clamouring to see the [health insurance companies] punished,\" Moore has said. </p> <p>Money should not be a problem: Fahrenheit 9/11 cost $6m (\u00a33.3m) to make and took more than $120m in the US alone. </p> <p>A Miramax source said yesterday that the deal was \"still in the works\", and Mr Moore was not commenting. The studio's parent company, Disney, was said to be unenthusiastic about getting directly involved. Moore has remained a high-profile presence in the US election campaign, writing a column for USA Today and attending the Republican convention in New York. </p> <p>When Senator John McCain gave a speech there, in which he singled Moore out for criticism, the film-maker - sitting on the press benches - could be seen responding to the audience's shouts of \"four more years\" with the words \"two more months\". </p> <p>The controversy surrounding the director was evident again yesterday when a California university banned him from speaking there. The president of California State University's San Marcos campus said hosting an obviously anti-Bush speaker in the run-up to an election would be illegal. </p> <p>\"As a public university, we are prohibited from spending state funds on partisan political activity or direct political advocacy,\" Karen Haynes said.</p>"
