  "Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso had thought he would be presenting a dream team to the European parliament today. Instead he is embroiled in a nightmare row over politics and morality in a power struggle that has injected rare passion and drama into an EU debate - and might, just, end up bringing ordinary people a little closer to the distant institutions that represent them. <p>It was not clear last night whether, or how, the fight over Rocco Buttiglione, Italy's controversial candidate for the Brussels executive - the commissioner-designate for justice and home affairs - can be resolved after a marathon bout of horsetrading in the Strasbourg assembly. If it is not, then many MEPs will be cock-a-hoop. But it will be at the cost of plunging the EU into a grave and unprecedented crisis. </p> <p>In any event, this is the worst start for Barroso, Maoist revolutionary turned centre-right Portuguese prime minister, taking over the presidency from the lacklustre Romano Prodi just as the EU adjusts to the reality of having 25 members and 450 million people - and is about to start years of difficult accession talks with Turkey. </p> <p>On Friday, heads of government gather in Rome for a ceremony to sign the new constitutional treaty. This is designed to make the union function more efficiently and democratically. But with referendums looming in several countries, including Britain, and apathy and Euroscepticism as bad as ever, it may never take effect. And then next week the EU will have to come to terms with the result of the US presidential election, with many leaders rooting privately for John Kerry, and thus risking exaggerated expectations of a man who may speak French and like working with allies, but will probably be unable to deliver a significantly better relationship between the old and new continents. Europe, so often trapped in the gap between aspiration and reality, does not seem poised to play a bigger, more coherent role in the world stage. </p> <p>That global role, though, must begin at home, and Buttiglione is not the only joker in the commission pack: MEPs also raised objections to the Dutch businesswoman appointed to take over the competition portfolio, the Hungarian unsuited to managing energy and the Danish agriculture commissioner married to a farmer enriched by CAP subsidies. </p> <p>None of these candidates generated much interest beyond the Brussels beltway. But the Italian conservative and friend of the Pope has raised hackles because of his views on homosexuality, single mothers and the family - classic beliefs of the conservative Catholic that he is. Feelings ran just as high during negotiations on the EU constitution, with the Italian, Polish and Irish governments - backed by the Vatican - demanding a clear reference to Christian values, but being defeated by the secular-minded majority which decided, correctly, that this would be the wrong message to send to Europe's multicultural societies - with 12 million Muslims, as well as those Turkish wannabes. </p> <p>Buttiglione was justified in arguing that there is a difference between law and morality, and he is entitled to his private views. But he showed a breathtaking lack of judgment in answering MEPs' questions the way he did. The row escalated when his supporters protested about an anti-Catholic \"inquisition\". Yet there is no such inquisition. Joe Borg, the Maltese commission candidate, is a staunch opponent of abortion, but that is irrelevant to his duties running fisheries policy. It is understandable that Barroso did not wish to cede too much ground to parliament. But he was foolish to reject a reshuffle that could have ended this fight quickly and simply. </p> <p>Some of this is the inevitable outcome of the sheer com plexity of the EU's hybrid, Heath Robinson structures. Buttiglione was nominated by Silvio Berlusconi just as Peter Mandelson was by Tony Blair, for similar reasons of domestic politics and the desire to set the policy agenda. The appointed commission president then has to find jobs for these national nominees - who must all pass muster in today's all-or-nothing vote by MEPs. </p> <p>It is a good idea for the European parliament to have a bigger say in the make-up of the union's supranational executive (those \"Brussels bureaucrats\" beloved of British newspapers) and disingenuous to say it should not have one because of poor turnout - a dismal 44% last June - in the European elections. Most people know little about an institution routinely scorned as a talking shop on a gravy train - though some may remember the jaw-dropping gaffe last year when Berlusconi compared a German MEP to a Nazi camp guard. Extraordinary misjudgments and a vicious skirmish over institutional power have come together to create a moment where the stakes for Europe's disenchanted union of states and peoples are suddenly very high. </p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>Ian Black left Brussels this summer after four years as the Guardian's European editor </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:ian.black@theguardian.com\">ian.black@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Sebastian (Bas) Pease, who has died aged 81, was a distinguished physicist and a remarkable man. The director of Britain's fusion research programme at the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) for many years, he was a leading member of the Pugwash Group, the international movement of scientists concerned about the social impact and misuse of science. <p>His scientific expertise and social conscience echoed his family background, with its Quaker roots. His paternal grandfather, Edward Reynolds Pease, was a co-founder of the Fabian Society and of the Labour Party. His father was a geneticist, while his mother was the daughter of Josiah C Wedgwood, who became a member of the first Labour Cabinet. Pease was educated in the stimulating and liberal atmosphere of Bedales school and took a degree in physics at Trinity College, Cambridge. </p> <p>In 1942, he joined the operational research unit at the headquarters of RAF bomber command, High Wycombe, where he worked on the development of \"blind\" bombing equipment and the use of aluminium \"window\" foil to deceive the German radars over the location of the D-day landings. He moved to the general physics division at Harwell in 1947 to work on solid-state research, producing some of the classic work on radiation damage and neutron diffraction. </p> <p>His main work on controlled nuclear fusion started in 1955, when, still at Harwell, he became leader of the physics research section, and later came to play a leading role in the Zeta (Zero Energy Thermonuclear Assembly) research team, which worked on the containment of hot plasma in a toroidal (doughnut-shaped) magnetic field. (When the results of his work there were published, the Daily Mail placed him on its shortlist of the most attractive men in the world.) </p> <p>The British fusion programme's work was transferred to Culham, Oxfordshire, in 1964, where he became division head and later, in 1967, director of the Culham Laboratory. Budget cuts and difficult times followed, but he managed to ensure that Culham maintained a broadly based fusion programme, including the initiation of a programme of commercial research in which Culham's skills were put to the needs of industry. </p> <p>Notwithstanding the cold war, Pease collaborated with Russian fusion experts, which was crucial in establishing the credibility of their tokamak - a pioneering plasma containment concept - claims. Pease formed a close and life-long rapport with their leader, Lev Artsimovich. </p> <p>In 1970, he opened a dialogue with Euratom (the European Atomic Energy Community) on British participation in its programme, though Britain was not yet a member of the European Community. When Britain did join, in 1973, Culham became involved in the Joint European Torus working group (Jet), and Pease pushed for the tokamak experiment to have a more ambitious design objective, to achieve a full-scale demonstration of thermonuclear fusion. He was subsequently involved in a long political wrangle over the location of Jet, and deserves much of the credit for the eventual decision of the EU council of ministers in 1977 that it should be at Culham. </p> <p>While Jet remains the world's leading fusion research apparatus, Pease was already pushing for its successor, Iter (international thermonuclear experimental reactor), itself now quagmired in geopolitical debate. He retired in 1988. </p> <p>His many honours included election to the Royal Society in 1977 (he became a council member and vice-president), and the award of the Glazebrook medal, the premier award in Britain for physics, in 1989. However, with his exceptional combination of long-range vision and tactical skill, his outstanding contribution to the British fusion programme was as a manager of what had become \"big science\". In the nuclear debate, Bas was a crossbencher - a strong advocate for the use of nuclear power, but equally opposed to nuclear weapons. He was a prominent member of the British Pugwash Group and a member of its international council when the Nobel peace prize was awarded jointly to it and its then president, Joseph Rotblat, in 1995. He contributed to a number of Pugwash publications, including one giving the case against the replacement of Trident. </p> <p>Bas was very much a family man. His first wife, Susan, had five children, and he used to take the whole family, including grandchildren, on holiday - though was sometimes heard to mutter that \"a round of ice cream would set you back\". Accomplished on both the clarinet and piano, he played in the Newbury amateur symphony orchestra. He also loved walking and entertaining his friends in his Berkshire home. </p> <p>After Susan's death in 1996, he married Jean, whom he had known at Culham. She died in 2000, and he married Eleanor, who survives him along with his three sons and two daughters. </p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>Rendel Sebastian Pease, physicist, born November 2 1922; died October 17 2004</p>",
  "Whether George Bush or John Kerry wins the White House next Tuesday, the next president faces an overflowing in-tray of international problems. <p>America's global power has never been greater. But never, since the September 11 catastrophe, has America's global leadership been under such sustained challenge. Rarely have issues of foreign policy had such a direct, existential bearing on America's sense of itself and its security. Rarely has what the American president decides mattered so much to so many. </p> <p>The most immediate worry is the security situation in Iraq. As the US tries to steer the country to elections in January, the predicted surge in violence may be compounded by a Sunni Muslim poll boycott. The insurgent redoubt of Falluja is again the likely, lethal flashpoint. </p> <p>Iran's nuclear ambitions are moving up the agenda. On November 25, the International Atomic Energy Agency must decide whether to report Iran to the UN security council. If it does so, punitive sanctions could follow. If the UN fails to agree, the White House will come under pressure, not least from Israel, to consider unilateral measures including possible military action. </p> <p>The next president will also quickly face demands, from Britain's Tony Blair among others, to launch a new drive to resolve the Israel-Palestine conflict - which many European and Arab governments view as a precondition for winning the \"war on terror\". </p> <p>Other problems in need of action include the humanitarian crisis in Sudan that Congress has termed genocide but which is proving resistant to international remedies. </p> <p>Some European diplomats fear a second Bush term could open the way for a sweeping expansion of Republican neo-conservative policies. This would only exacerbate existing divisions over issues such as the Kyoto climate change treaty, global trade and development, and international law. </p> <p>Victory for Mr Kerry would entail different kinds of uncertainty. A sort of interregnum would ensue until his inauguration next January. Once in office, a new Democratic administration would take months to settle in - confronted in all probability by a hostile Republican-controlled Congress. </p> <p>Whoever wins, these are some of the principal issues facing the next president: </p> <p><b> Anti-Americanism </b><br> </p> <p>The Bush presidency has brought a surge in anti-American sentiment, notably in the Arab, Muslim and European spheres. This phenomenon is undermining US influence and effectiveness across the board, making it difficult to persuade others to follow America's lead. </p> <p>For the first time, the US is seen by majorities in many countries, especially by younger Muslims, as a potential enemy rather than a friend. </p> <p>Such conclusions are borne out by a clutch of international opinion surveys and by an official worldwide study undertaken last year by a former US ambassador, Edward Djerejian. He found the US was losing the battle for hearts and minds. Since then, the Guant\u00e1namo Bay and Abu Ghraib abuse scandals have further damaged America's standing abroad. </p> <p><b>Terrorism </b><br> </p> <p>While the next president will be under intense pressure to win the \"war on terror\", it remains unclear exactly who or where the enemy is - or how it can best be defeated. </p> <p>Despite the elimination of some leading al-Qaida figures, Osama bin Laden remains at large. Meanwhile, al-Qaida's cause has devolved to loose-knit, copycat groups in countries such as Saudi Arabia, Chechnya and Pakistan. The Iraq insurgency has proved both magnet and recruiting sergeant for Islamist extremists. </p> <p>Mr Bush has repeatedly claimed to have al-Qaida and its affiliates on the run. But a report this month by the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London estimated that al-Qaida can potentially draw on 18,000 operatives in 60 countries. Al-Qaida, it said, had been \"galvanised\" by the Iraq war. </p> <p>Unless remedial action is taken, the \"war on terror\" will continue to be destabilising in geo-political terms. It has been used by states such as Israel, Russia and China to justify harsher treatment of nationalists and separatists. It has drawn the US into problematic alliances with undemocratic regimes in central Asia. And it has led to divisive erosion of civil liberties abroad and in the US. </p> <p><b>Proliferation </b><br> </p> <p>Mr Bush and Mr Kerry agree that the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is the single most serious threat to international security. While the next president's focus will be on Iran and North Korea, a bigger fear is that non-state actors such as al-Qaida will obtain WMD. North Korea claims already to have nuclear weapons. Multilateral negotiations to induce it to disarm have stalled. Mr Kerry says he will talk directly to Pyongyang, something Mr Bush refuses to do. </p> <p>Syria is another concern, as is a region-wide Middle East WMD arms race should Iran obtain the bomb. Unsecured WMD-related stockpiles in the former Soviet Union and smuggling rings like that uncovered in Pakistan are also a big worry vis \u00e0 vis future terrorist capabilities. </p> <p>All these problems are compounded by the weakness of international regulation, inspection and verification regimes and by the \"double standards\" of existing nuclear powers which refuse to renounce their weapons. </p> <p><b>Conflict zones </b><br> </p> <p>The US urgently needs more international military and UN civilian support in Iraq. Washington will ask Nato and Muslim countries to contribute additional troops at a conference in Egypt next month. Severe US military over-stretch lies behind the recent, controversial request for British redeployments in Iraq. Overall, meeting America's myriad global military commitments is becoming increasingly expensive and problematic in terms of personnel, hence the speculation about a post-election draft. </p> <p>The US remains heavily committed in Afghanistan, with 20,000 troops still fighting the Taliban and al-Qaida. There are also growing concerns about a reviving instability in the Balkans, particularly in Kosovo where final-status talks are due to begin next year. </p> <p>Israel-Palestine and Iraq apart, the Middle East as a whole remains a critical national security concern for any US president, given America's chronic dependence on oil. Bilateral post-9/11 relations with Saudi Arabia are especially fraught. </p> <p><b> Old rivals</b> </p> <p>China's rapid economic growth is creating political and geo-strategic challenges for America which the next president will be forced to address. </p> <p>Bilateral trade is booming. The Olympics are coming to Beijing. But China remains an undemocratic Communist state with a poor human rights record. President Hu Jintao is an unknown quantity. Yet the US needs China's good offices if, for example, the North Korean stand-off is to be ended. </p> <p>Russia is another potential problem, despite relatively greater stability under Mr Putin. Moscow's reaction to the Beslan school tragedy has revived questions about the Russian president's authoritarianism - which also affects countries in the \"near abroad\" like Ukraine and Georgia </p> <p>Like China, Russia is developing new long-range missiles in response to Mr Bush's \"son of Star Wars\" ballistic missile defence project, prompting fears of a new arms race. </p> <p><b> Multilateralism </b><br> </p> <p>US relations with leading European Union countries, especially France, are in need of repair. But trade and other disputes with the EU will certainly figure on the next president's agenda. </p> <p>More fundamentally challenging is the EU's gradual emergence as a global political player. Its development of a collective military capability, potentially undermining Nato, is a gauntlet that the White House may be obliged to pick up. This in turn relates to knotty questions about the legitimacy of intervention and \"just war\" concepts. </p> <p>Radically different European attitudes to the UN and upholding international law through institutions such as the world court and the international criminal court are key areas of contention. UN reform is another pressing issue. </p> <p>Underlying all these concerns is the European insistence on multilateral approaches to common problems, in contrast to Bush-era unilateralism. For the next president, perhaps the most difficult challenge will be to decide if and when the US goes it alone. If Mr Bush has proved anything, it is that even America cannot do it all.</p>",
  "<p>Theressia Gresham's unemployment cheques stopped arriving two months ago. Ms Gresham, who lives in Cleveland, Ohio, lost her job as a forklift driver at the beginning of the year and has been unable to find work since. The United States government will pay just 26 weeks of benefits before cutting workers loose to fend for themselves. The Bush administration, convinced that the economy is on the rebound, recently ended a programme extending the payments a further 13 weeks. She can't afford to be ill because she has no healthcare insurance, although she has developed high blood pressure and diabetes since being unemployed. </p> <p>Ms Gresham, 42, who has worked all her life, now spends her days at the United Labor Agency, a federally funded organisation that helps people get back to work, sending out job applications, researching on the internet and hoping. America's flexible labour market is much admired by the International Monetary Fund and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, but the downside to the dynamism is that for those who fall on hard times life is cruel. There are 93,000 people in Ohio who are now living without unemployment benefits and Theressia is one of them. </p> <p>\"I've exhausted everything,\" she says, looking close to tears. \"I have no income. Sometimes my mother loans me money but she is an elderly woman. I can't get the medications I need. I didn't even know the unemployment was going to stop. My rent was due Saturday and I told my landlord I would have it by the end of the week, but I probably won't. This is just awful.\" </p> <p>The United States treasury secretary John Snow last week told an audience in Ohio that the oft-cited jobs lost under the presidency of George Bush were a myth. He later had to retract the claim: Ms Gresham and millions like her are the reality - a working-class that the government and much of America would rather ignore. </p> <p>According to the census bureau, another 1.3 million Americans fell below the poverty line last year, taking the total to 35.9 million, around 12.5% of the population. The number of people without health insurance grew by 1.4 million to 45 million. Since Bush arrived in the White House, the number below the poverty line has risen by 4.3 million, the number lacking healthcare by 5.2 million. </p> <p>Cleveland, in the battleground state of Ohio, was recently judged to be the poorest big city in America by the US census bureau, toppling Detroit. Steve Newman, who runs the United Labor Agency, says the number of people coming through the organisation looking for work has tripled over the past three years. </p> <p>Bush, he notes, has at least increased the agency's funding. </p> <p>Built on manufacturing, Cleveland has suffered the fate of many industrial cities in America's north-east. With its grand buildings from a more prosperous era, it has the feel of one of Britain's northern industrial cities, hollowed out by de-industrialisation. The population has steadily fallen as people headed for the new jobs in the suburbs, leaving behind a city with dwindling tax dollars and needy people. Lay-offs have not been confined to manufacturing. The city has shed 700 teachers and in East Cleveland, a lack of money has forced cuts in the numbers of police officers patrolling some of Ohio's meanest streets. </p> <p>According to Ohio Policy Matters, a bipartisan thinktank based in the city, any recovery from the recession that began in 2001 has passed the state by. </p> <p>The state lost jobs for three consecutive years since the peak in 2000. There have been meagre job gains so far this year, but the state still has 217,000 fewer employed than in March 2001 when the nationwide recession officially began, a 3.9% drop. At the same point after the 1991 recession, the state had posted a 1.3% increase. At the current rate it will take Ohio six years to reach pre-recession levels of employment. </p> <p>\"There has been no previous recovery with this little job gain,\" says executive director of the thinktank, Amy Hanauer. \"Many of the jobs that have left Ohio are not coming back.\" </p> <p>At the same time, wages are getting lower, partly the result of the loss of good paying unionised factory jobs and growth in service sectors, the so-called \"Wal-Mart effect\". The median wage last year was $13.14 (\u00a37.15) an hour. Accounting for inflation, the median Ohio wage in 1979 was $13.44. </p> <p>Ohio is not alone in suffering. Michigan, with its high concentration of car plants, has had an even tougher time, while neighbouring Pennsylvania has also seen its manufacturing base affected by the double whammy of weak demand and competition from China. Anger over what is seen as Beijing's illegal manipulation of its currency is palpable. John Kerry's proposal to review all trade agreements within his first 120 days in office is popular in Ohio, not least because government figures show that between 1995 and 2004 52,265 jobs were lost in the state as the result of international trade. In truth, however, the loss of jobs in manufacturing is not new. Estimates suggest that 40% of the job losses have been the result of higher productivity, but even so the past four years have been especially tough. Manufacturing employment in the US has been cut from 17 million to 14 million and those that have survived have had to become leaner and - in many cases - meaner. </p> <p>Todd Weddell is president of a steel workers' local union in Niles, 60 miles south east of Cleveland. He and his 360 members have been locked out for a year after refusing to accept a 15% cut in their compensation package. Their employer, RMI Titanium, said it needed to save $3.5m from of its wage bill. \"The whole situation is totally grim,\" Weddell says. </p> <p><strong> How do we compete?</strong><br> </p> <p> Both Kerry and John Edwards have been on the picket line at Niles in one of their many visits during this knife-edge contest, but some of the steel workers are now looking for jobs that are likely to pay around half as much as the $16 an hour they were previously getting. If Kerry won, Weddell said, there would at least \"be someone in the White House who cared about working people in America\". </p> <p>Disappointment with Bush is not confined to organised labour. Steve Schler, president of Pro-Mold, which makes plastic moulds in Akron and has sales of $1.6m, said the downturn since the boom of the late 90s \"has been the worst that I have experienced. Prior to that I thought the early 1980s was the worst. </p> <p>\"We have felt competition from the far east - China, Taiwan, Korea. How do we compete? I haven't got a clue.\" </p> <p>The other significant issue facing ProMold, as it is facing workers themselves, is healthcare. Premiums are getting ever more expensive. In 2002, ProMold's premiums rose by 13%. Last year, the cost was 17% higher and this year 18% higher. The result has been to scale back coverage and make workers pay a higher portion of the costs. </p> <p>Ed Herman, the Republican candidate for Ohio's 10th district, including much of Cleveland, says Bush's ideas for tackling big structural problems such as social security and healthcare recognise that the world has moved on from the days of the industrial plants of the 30s and that a more individual approach is required. </p> <p>\"The Democrats' old tactic is class warfare and they do it effectively. It is a myth perpetuated that Republicans want to destroy the welfare system. That is not the case. The services are being expanded not shrunk and as that awareness spreads more people will consider themselves Republican.\" </p> <p>Zack Schiller, at Ohio Policy Matters, disagrees. While the president has directed tax cuts towards the wealthy and large corporations, the American working-class is feeling threatened, he says. \"Many welfare programmes are under attack. Medicaid [which helps poor people buy prescription drugs] will probably be cut back; they have lowered the threshold on subsidised childcare; they are trying to reduce housing subsidies. To an extent this election is a referendum on the welfare state.\" </p> <p>An outsider might have difficulty understanding why Ohio is even a swing state. But the Bush administration has been effective in directing attention away from the economy and making it instead about homeland security and social issues such as abortion and gay marriage. The president is more popular in the rural south of the state, but even in Cleveland, union organisers say 30% of their members vote Republican. </p> <p>John Ryan, who runs the local chapter of the AFL-CIO, the umbrella union organisation in the US, explains that many of his blue-collar members are Republican. \"We have devout Catholics or Christian right who have strong views on abortion or gun owners who want to own a bazooka.\" In the end, though, he believes that the mass registration campaign organised by the Democrats will win the state for Kerry. \"God and guns can't compete.\"</p> <p><strong>State of the nation's health: Plans and pledges</strong></p> <p><strong> Bush's first-term record </strong> In 2002, 75% of Americans were covered fully by health insurance, 44 million were not covered at all and 70 million either had no cover or were not covered for part of a year; those not covered were more likely to be children, young adults and Latinos; average healthcare costs are estimated to be $14,500 (\u00a37,800) per family by 2006 </p> <p><strong> Plans</strong> </p> <p><strong>Bush</strong> Tax credit of $700 per low income individual or $2,000 per family to help the uninsured; no change to drug pricing, which prevents imports of cheaper drugs because they could be tainted </p> <p><strong> Kerry</strong> Tax credits to make healthcare cheaper for small businesses, those near retirement and workers between jobs; use IT to cut red tape, saving $350bn annually; allow drug imports from Canada</p>",

  "Jose Manuel Barroso, the incoming European Commission president, is preparing to head off the prospect that MEPs will vote out his entire commission tomorrow with key concessions over his choice of a new justice chief. <p>It is understood that Mr Barroso is making clear to Socialist, Liberal and Green opponents that he has definitively stripped Rocco Buttiglione, the Italian Catholic and outspoken critic of gay and women's rights, of all civil liberties duties. </p> <p>But he will insist on retaining Mr Buttiglione as justice and home affairs commissioner. </p> <p>Senior colleagues yesterday indicated that the new president is also prepared to go further and agree to promote a new EU law banning all forms of discrimination on sexual, gender or religious grounds on a pan-European basis - a key demand of liberals and other critics. </p> <p>Mr Barroso will also pledge that the new commission, due to take office this weekend, will beef up the Vienna-based EU monitoring centre on racism and xenophobia. This will nominally become Mr Buttiglione's responsibility but will effectively come under the control of the commission president and senior colleagues. </p> <p>Last week Mr Barroso offered relatively minor, and confusing, concessions to his opponents over Mr Buttiglione, but raised the prospect of an institutional crisis within the EU by provoking the 200-strong Socialist group of MEPs to threaten to vote as a bloc against his whole team. </p> <p>The Liberal leader, Graham Watson, has urged him to go further or risk a majority vote among the 732 MEPs against him and his 24 colleagues. Last night Peter Mandelson, the new trade commissioner, said: \"I think we are on the way to finding a solution that should leave both sides happy. </p> <p>\"Parliament must be listened to and we have to show we understand its concerns but, equally, parliament cannot take a sledge hammer to this issue by insisting on the reconstruction of the commission.\" </p> <p>Mr Mandelson has lobbied leading Socialist MEPs in favour of a compromise in advance of tomorrow's vote. Intensive efforts to avert a full-blown crisis took place in Strasbourg last night and are to continue today. </p> <p>In Brussels, Romano Prodi, the outgoing commission president, said he and his team were prepared to carry on in a caretaker capacity if an emergency arose. \"I hate the idea, but we must be ready to step in.\"</p>",
  "Victory is a formality for Hamid Karzai now. With only a handful of votes still uncounted in Afghanistan's historic election, the US-backed leader is streaking ahead of his nearest rival with 55% of ballots. <p>The result surprises nobody. Urbane, charismatic and competent, Mr Karzai wooed billions of dollars in international aid after the US bombed the Taliban from power in 2001. Now he has proved the charm sparkles at home too.</p> <p>Although Mr Karzai's core support came from fellow Pashtuns, many Afghans, particularly in the cities, voted across ethnic lines. And despite howls of complaint about vote rigging from his opponents, they now look likely to accept the result.</p> <p>The poll was also an indirect endorsement of US involvement in Afghanistan where, in contrast with Iraq, Americans are not viewed as an occupying force. Thousands of miles away President George Bush, desperate for a counterpoint to the Baghdad quagmire, has been crowing on the campaign stump about the glories of Afghanistan.</p> <p>Meanwhile his military commanders are boasting that the Taliban, who failed to deliver on fiery threats of scuppering the poll, are effectively finished.</p> <p>Such talk is premature. Despite the heart-warming tableau of millions of illiterate people queuing to vote, Afghanistan's democratic transition is far from certain. A host of rapacious forces - warlords, weapons, and drugs money - are looming large in advance of the real electoral test.</p> <p>In reality this election, although inspiring, was little more than a Karzai popularity plebiscite against the backdrop of an opposition beauty pageant. Most voters saw little choice between the modernising incumbent with the powerful US ambassador at his elbow; and a motley array of warlords, Islamic fundamentalists and varied no-hopers with little hope of bridging divides.</p> <p>Nevertheless the contest was not entirely theatre. Though nobody expected to beat Mr Karzai, his nearest contender Yunus Qanooni hoped to push him to a runoff vote. Warlords more accustomed to directing tank battles sought to stake out their political turf and, in the scramble, quietly efface their bloodstained histories of wartime atrocities.</p> <p>The parliamentary elections, on the other hand, will present much higher stakes. Hundreds of candidates, some backed up by warlords, will be running for office. In a craggy country awash with weapons, that could make for a dangerous contest - unless Mr Karzai acts fast.</p> <p>His first step will be the appointment of a cabinet. Until now, Mr Karzai has appeased the warlords, hoping to lure them out of fatigues and into business suits with promises of government jobs. For example it is widely expected that Ismail Khan, the 'Lion of Heart', will be offered a ministerial position.</p> <p>But civil society, human rights and some government officials say this policy must stop. They favour shunning the hardmen, arguing it is time for a clean break with the conflict-ridden past. But the polling figures make the choice less easy for Mr Karzai.</p> <p>Gen Abdul Rashid Dostum, an ethnic Uzbek, polled a respectable 10% of votes while Mohammed Mohaqeq, a Hazara hardman, took 12%. Having, as they see it, legitimised their positions, the warlords are now expected to lobby hard for government jobs.</p> <p>They have other bargaining chips too. Although legally required to sever links with their private armies before the election, warlords like Dostum retain the informal loyalty of thousands of roaming militiamen.</p> <p>An estimated 40,000 gunmen have skirted demobilisation, a process Mr Karzai is keen to accelerate before the April poll. So in choosing a cabinet, he may have to balance sidelining the warlord leaders against demobilising their troops.</p> <p>Karzai also faces a thorny technocratic issue. In a country where no census has been carried out for decades, the demarcation of about 350 electoral districts remains in dispute. The boundaries are controversial and are sure to provoke regional disputes. But to dally in settling them, says UN election adviser Reginald Austin, could have a disastrous effect on preparing for the April poll.</p> <p>The Taliban factor is more uncertain than ever. Euphoria at the lack of election violence was dampened by a suicide bombing in Kabul last Saturday that killed one American and two Afghans, one an 11-year-old girl.</p> <p>Much may depend on the attitude of neighbouring Pakistan, which has publicly allied itself with Karzai yet still tolerates the presence of thousands of Taliban in edgy northern cities such as Quetta and Peshawar.</p> <p>The coming election may also call the international community's bluff. This month\u00b9s poll could have been a disaster. Only a year ago the UN-led preparations were marred by poor security, lack of funds and a frozen voter registration process. In the end though, a combination of expert planning and Afghan determination saw it through.</p> <p>But only a few hundred international observers were deployed to Afghanistan, in contrast with thousands deployed to landmark elections in Cambodia, South Africa and East Timor over the past 11 years. Next time, it won't be so easy.</p> <p>Observers are crucial. They help ensure a fair contest, help prevent cheating and make sure gunmen don't badger voters on their way into the booths. And although lip service is paid to 'Afghanisation' of the preparations \u00ad which is often a figleaf excuse for security concerns - lingering distrust between local politicians means international assistance is key to underwriting the process.</p> <p>But to assign even one monitor for every two polling centres in Afghanistan would require about 2,500 people, and many more international peacekeepers. And most of the 18,000 US-led troops are hunting the Taliban or al-Qaida, while about another 9,000 Nato-led soldiers are limited to Kabul and a handful of other cities.</p> <p>Greater international deployment would be both expensive and dangerous. But now that Afghanistan has taken its first tentative step to democracy there are few other choices.</p> <p>Stopping is impossible. But to perform the job half-heartedly could fatally damage Afghans' newfound faith in voting. Either way, it could risk the implosion of an impressive, but still worryingly fragile, achievement.</p>",
  "<p>John Peel, the veteran DJ who discovered dozens of major bands during a broadcasting career spanning 40 years, has died after suffering a heart attack.</p> <p>Peel, who was 65, was taken ill during a working holiday with his wife, Sheila, in the city of Cuzco, Peru, and never recovered.</p> <p>The Radio 1 controller, Andy Parfitt, described Peel as a \"broadcasting legend\".</p> <p>\"I am deeply saddened by his death, as are all who work at Radio 1,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Walking around the station there is an outpouring of grief and feeling that we want to do something [in tribute]. I am sure in the days and weeks to come we will find a way of doing that on the airwaves.\"</p> <p>\"We are absolutely knocked out here at Radio 1,\" he said. \"He was a joy to work with. We regularly have DJ suppers where we fill the room with our specialist DJs. John would come along and as the evening wore on, people would gather around him almost like a throne listening to his fantastic stories.</p> <p>\"What we find about great broadcasters is that they are completely dedicated to the music. John would seek out the most obscure and most interesting things to him and would play it and talk about it. That's what makes really exciting radio, people saying exactly what they feel, and that's why people loved John. He was real.\"</p> <p>Parfitt said it was always difficult to persuade Peel, who died on a working holiday in Peru, to take time off from the station. \"We persuaded him to take a holiday somewhere he particularly wanted to visit,\" he said.</p> <p>As a tribute to Peel, the first record Radio 1 played after his death was announced on Newsbeat at lunchtime today, was The Undertones' Teenage Kicks, one of the DJ's favourite songs. </p> <p>This was followed by tracks from the White Stripes and the Strokes - two other artists from the recent revival in guitar-based indie music that Peel was very much associated with.</p> <p>The Undertones bass player, Michael Bradley, today said Peel's death had robbed radio and the music industry of one of its greatest voices. </p> <p>\"He was a very funny, very warm man and we will always be grateful for what he did for The Undertones,\" said Bradley.</p> <p>\"Personally, I find it incredible what he did for the band and we always got huge pride out of the fact he said Teenage Kicks was his favourite single,\" he added.</p> <p>Over the last four decades he was renowned for helping to break bands from the Undertones to Siouxsie and the Banshees who were unsigned before he played them.</p> <p>Siouxsie Sioux was a guest DJ on the show last Wednesday when he was on holiday as was Robert Smith, the lead singer of the Cure, a band Peel also championed in the late 70s.</p> <p>\"He always had his finger on the pulse of the music industry and the fact that Radio 1 played the Undertones, the White Stripes and the Strokes today showed just how relevant he remained throughout his career,\" said Bradley.</p> <p>Peel presented the award-winning Radio 4 programme Home Truths as well as a late-night weekday show on Radio 1 and was famous as a champion of new music. </p> <p>Tributes also poured in from BBC bosses - Mark Thompson, the director general, said he was \"shocked and saddened\" by Peel's death. </p> <p>\"He was one of the giants of radio and will be missed not just by everyone at the BBC but by millions of listeners of all ages,\" Mr Thompson said.</p> <p>The BBC director of radio and music, Jenny Abramsky, added: \"John Peel was a unique broadcaster whose influence on Radio 1 could be felt from its very first days. </p> <p>\"He nurtured musicians and listeners alike, introducing them to new sounds.</p> <p>\"His open-minded approach to music was mirrored by his equally generous approach to his audience when he went to Radio 4 to present Home Truths. </p> <p>\"He had a remarkable rapport with all his listeners. Everyone at BBC Radio is devastated by the news. </p> <p>\"John is simply irreplaceable. Our hearts go out to Sheila and his children.\" </p> <p>Peel was a hero not just to generations of listeners but to the younger crop of DJs.</p> <p>Radio 1 DJ Jo Wylie described the presenter as \"one of my favourite men in the whole world. He was an absolute inspiration and simply the don. Everyone at Radio 1 and everyone who has ever met him will testify to that. He is the biggest and saddest loss to everybody.\"</p> <p>Parfitt added: \"John's influence has towered over the development of popular music for nearly four decades and his contribution to modern music and music culture is immeasurable.</p> <p>\"Hopeful bands all over the world sent their demo tapes to John, knowing that he really cared. His commitment and passion for new music only grew stronger over the years. </p> <p>\"In fact, when I last saw him he was engaged in a lively debate with his fellow DJs over the state of new music today. He will be hugely missed.\"</p> <p>\"It feels like John Peel invented Radio 1,\" said one text messager to Radio 1 today. Another said: \"I don't think I have ever been affected so much by the death of someone I have never met.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, John Peel's legions of music fans have been flooding the Radio 1 message boards today, expressing their shock and sadness </p> <p>One fan said Glastonbury festival organisers should name a stage after him in his memory.</p> <p>Another pointed out that his humour was so self-effacing that he once appeared with a T-shirt saying 'John Peel is a cunt'.</p> <p>Across all ages and musical genres condolences poured in for the \"saviour of Radio 1\" and the \"most important musical influence on me and millions of others\".</p> <p>\"It's a great loss to music lovers across the world. No single person has done more for new bands and new music,\" wrote another fan.</p> <p>\"He never ceased to amaze and inspire me with his energy, knowledge, enthusiasm and eclecticism. A true giant among men - he will never be replaced,\" said another fan of the DJ whose typical play list might include a Gram Parsons B-side, a band from Zimbabwe, a live session by Bongwater, Finnish folk music and an industrial track by members of Steel Pole Bath Tub. </p> <p> <strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",

  "<p>I'm here in Denver reporting and blogging for Guardian Unlimited in the final days of the US election. Colorado, normally a reliably Republican state when it comes to presidential elections, has found itself in something of a unique situation lately: it looks just possible that Bush could lose here. </p> <p>Aundrea Davis never expected to be a victim of political arson, but she's found it all rather amusing. Last week someone in her Denver neighbourhood found her \"support our troops, bring them home\" lawn sign so offensive that they burned it to the ground. Her neighbour grabbed the garden hose and put out the fire before anything more than the sign caught fire. </p> <p>Thing is, Davis says, it's been there, untouched, since April 2003. Why all the stupidity all of a sudden?</p> <p>Though it seems unlikely that many people base their choice for president, or senate, or even local sheriff on how many of their neighbours are moved to hammer their political convictions into their front garden, prominent support for either party seems to be driving a certain class of vandal mad. </p> <p>At <strong>Powerline</strong> blog, John Hinderaker, aka Hindrocket, recounts a sorry <a href=\"http://powerlineblog.com/archives/008291.php\">tale of voter intimidation</a> in the Colorado mountains, where Republican residents have seen their Bush-Cheney signs torched or trashed. More worryingly, one resident reported that a car with a Bush bumper sticker had its window smashed in, while another had a glass door in their home smashed. </p> <p>Hindrocket's solution? \"It occurs to me that as this low-level violence becomes more and more prevalent, the Second Amendment will take on increasing importance.\" In case you need a reminder, that's <a href=\"http://www.house.gov/Constitution/Amend.html\">\"the right of the people to keep and bear arms\"</a>. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.archpundit.com/archives/011282.html\">Archpundit</a> has had enough of it: \"Whining over the defacement or theft of lawn signs drive me absolutely batty. Yes, it's illegal, but don't you want the 'other side' doing that instead of actually, you know, getting votes?\" </p> <p>Back in Denver, one thing still bothers lawn sign victim Davis: her sign supporting <a href=\"http://www.kucinich.us/\">Dennis Kucinich</a> has not been touched. Some causes are just too lost even for the most partisan of vandals.</p>",
  "With one week to go, Americans are being inundated by polls. At least 112 have been published for the presidential contest in the last week alone. <p>While it's tempting to look at the jumble of results and declare polling hopelessly useless, fact is, polls have a great deal to tell us about the state of the race. And not in the way people generally assume:</p> <p><b>It's not the head to head</b></p> <p>Polls are always reported as though there's a winner, and there's a loser. So a poll showing Bush leading 45-42 is headlined \"Bush leads by three\", when the reality is that Bush is actually losing.</p> <p>In US elections, any elected official garnering less than 50% of the vote in polls is considered vulnerable. As Democratic pollster Mark Blumenthal <a href=\"http://www.mysterypollster.com/main/2004/10/the_incumbent_r.html\">notes</a>: </p> <p>\"Voters typically know incumbents well and have strong opinions about their performance. Challengers are less familiar and invariably fall short on straightforward comparisons of experience and (in the presidential arena) command of foreign policy. Some voters find themselves conflicted - dissatisfied with the incumbent yet also wary of the challenger - and may carry that uncertainty through the final days of the campaign and sometimes right into the voting booth. Among the perpetually conflicted, the attitudes about the incumbent are usually more predictive of these conflicted voters' final decision than their lingering doubts about the challenger. Thus, in the campaign's last hours, we tend to see 'undecided' voters 'break' for the challenger.\"</p> <p>Testing this theory, blogger Chris Bowers examined presidential poll results since 1976, and <a href=\"http://www.mydd.com/story/2004/9/3/22294/96534\">calculated</a> that undecided voters broke for the challenger 86% of the time.</p> <p>It's a dynamic that clearly weighs on the Bush campaign. Speaking to conservative bloggers at the Republican national convention, Bush's pollster Matthew Dowd said the 50% rule <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/Commentary/blog_8_30_04_1525.html\">didn't apply to the president</a>:</p> <p>\"Based on the polling data they've aggregated on undecideds in battleground states, the Bush team has compiled the following profile on undecideds: they are overwhelmingly white, tend to be older, go to church often and describe themselves as moderate to conservative. Dowd says they can't find any self-described liberals who remain undecided.\"</p> <p>As a result, he predicted that Bush would either split or outright win the vote of the undecided bloc. While not outside of the realm of possibilities, there is nothing indicating that Bush could buck the historical trends embodied in the 50% rule. That they're forced to spin it away hints at their concerns.</p> <p><b>There is no national election</b></p> <p>While the press is obsessed with horse race national numbers, the fact is that we Americans don't elect our president directly. Rather, we have 51 state elections, including Washington DC. That means that for voters in 35 to 40 states, their votes really don't matter and neither do their responses to pollsters' questions. It is only voters in the small group of \"swing states\" that essentially elect the US president: Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Wisconsin (give or take a state).</p> <p><b>Different pollsters use different methodologies</b></p> <p>No two polls are built alike. Some weigh their results by demographics (race and geography), others weigh by expected turnout and party identification, and yet others don't weigh at all. Some polls attempt to filter out unlikely voters asking questions they think will flag those least motivated to vote. Some polls are partisan and will game their assumptions in order to give their side a boost in the results.</p> <p>This is critical when trying to sift through seemingly contradictory polling. Polling is nothing more than educated guessing. Some get it right, some get it wrong, and half the time luck is probably involved. That's why it's best to look at polls in the aggregate - easy to do given the sheer number of them - rather than obsess over any one particular poll.</p> <p><b>The state of the race</b></p> <p>With that brief polling primer, anyone can take a <a href=\"http://2.004k.com/latest/\">look at the numbers</a> and get a sense for the state of the race. And a strict by-the-numbers calculation shows that Bush is in serious trouble.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://2.004k.com/state/?s=Ohio\">Ohio</a>, Bush numbers range from 43-49%, failing to break 50% in any of the 12 Ohio polls in October. Indeed, there are signs that Bush has essentially abandoned the state, working to build his electoral majority by winning three out of four in Florida, Iowa, Wisconsin, and New Mexico. But October polling in those states also show an incumbent in serious trouble.</p> <p>In 14 <a href=\"http://2.004k.com/state/?s=Florida\">Florida</a> polls, Bush hasn't broken 50% since a SurveyUSA poll conducted between October 1 and October 3. A subsequent SurveyUSA poll now gives Kerry a 50-49 lead in the state. In <a href=\"http://2.004k.com/state/?s=Iowa\">Iowa</a>, a single poll has him at 51% while six others range between 46% and 49%. <a href=\"http://2.004k.com/state/?s=Wisconsin\">Wisconsin</a> is giving Democrats heartburn, but Bush breaks 50% in only one of the nine polls this month. Two independent polls put him as far back as 43%. <a href=\"http://2.004k.com/state/?s=New+Mexico\">New Mexico</a> has Bush in the 43-49% range, anaemic numbers in a state Gore won by less than 1,000 votes.</p> <p>Much can happen in one week, and Republicans are doing their part to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uselections2004/markosmoulitsas/story/0,15139,1331610,00.html\">prevent a fair election</a>. Perhaps the Bush campaign is right and the 50% rule won't apply to them this year. But the Bushies haven't been right about much of anything the past four years, while Democrats are vigorously challenging voter suppression efforts around the country. As of this writing, this is Kerry's election to lose.</p> <p><b><b><b>\u00b7</b></b></b> Markos Moulitsas runs the <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/\">dailykos.com</a> US political blog, and <a href=\"http://www.ourcongress.org/\">Our Congress</a>, a blog tracking the hottest congressional races</p> <p><b><b><b>\u00b7</b></b></b> Comment on this article <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/news/archives/us_elections/2004/10/polling_truth.html\">here</a></p>",

  "When Eric Rohmer released The Lady and the Duke three years ago, French critics hated it so much they suggested he ought to be guillotined. He had committed the unpardonable sin of portraying French revolutionaries as brutal, drunken oafs, and the bouffanted aristos as noble agitators for justice. <p>Two years on, Rohmer has released another period drama, set this time among White Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 spies in the pre-war political turmoil of Paris in 1936. Triple Agent is not, on the face of it, a film likely to win over sceptical critics. \"It is by far the most verbose of my films,\" he says proudly as he reclines in his Paris office. </p> <p>This is a worrying claim given that Rohmer is historically the talkiest director in a film culture not noted for keeping quiet. In fact, the French critics have adored Triple Agent. One wrote: \"It is a spy film without action, a tragic love story founded on words, in which Rohmer reinvents himself while remaining the same. Admirable.\" </p> <p>Surely, then, given that Rohmer is now 84 and still the least honoured of all those great French film directors who made up the Nouvelle Vague (Truffaut, Godard, Chabrol, Rivette), it is time for the critics to put their guillotines away and agitate for a combined l\u00e9gion d'honneur and lifetime Oscar. </p> <p>It won't happen. Rohmer has often been a director who irritates people, especially critics (perhaps partly because he was one himself). Pauline Kael wrote: \"His sensibility would be easier to take if he'd stop directing to a metronome.\" Those misgivings were best expressed by Gene Hackman who, as a detective in the 1975 film Night Moves, said: \"I saw a Rohmer film once. It was kind of like watching paint dry.\" (Though it was Rivette who really did make a film in which paint dried - La Belle Noiseuse, 1991.) </p> <p>Rohmer's best known work, My Night with Maud (1969), is about a man who spends a night with the eponymous hotsy-totsy divorcee. Instead of seducing Maud, he discusses Pascal's wager and the Jansenist philosophy of predestination until sunrise. Rohmer is a devout Catholic and the film's moral, should one be inclined to find anything so reductive in an Eric Rohmer film, is that self-restraint is the path to salvation. </p> <p>Rohmer says many of his films consist of a \"story that deals less with what people do than with what is going on in their heads while they are doing it\". No wonder, perhaps, that he has been attacked for being a novelist working in the wrong medium. </p> <p>Triple Agent, Rohmer claims, is typical of his oeuvre: \"All my films are spy films in a sense. They all deal with characters spying on others or being suspicious of others.\" But it is hardly James Bond? \"True. Genre films don't interest me at all.\" </p> <p>Rohmer's scenario for Triple Agent was inspired by an enigmatic story he found in a historical journal about the abduction by the Soviets of a White Russian general called General Miller, the president of the Russian War Veterans. His deputy, General Skobline, a double agent working for the Bolsheviks, was suspected of having had a hand in the kidnapping. This could never be proved - he disappeared shortly afterwards, leaving his wife to take the rap. She was convicted as an accessory and died in prison in 1940. Did Skobline betray his wife? Did she know about the abduction? Whose side was Skobline really on? </p> <p>\"There was nothing clear about the story, no certainty as to what happened or why, so it left me free to invent my own version of it,\" says Rohmer. </p> <p>And he did. Setting his drama amid contemporary newsreels showing the election of Leon Blum's Popular Front government in 1936, the start of the Spanish civil war, the start of the second world war and the Nazi-Soviet Pact, Rohmer plunges us into a murky political milieu. \"All epochs are unclear,\" says Rohmer. \"This is why I'm interested in history. It enables us to discover the truth of the past. We can even discover the truth with the help of fiction.\" </p> <p>In Rohmer's hands, General Skobline mutates from a double to a possible triple agent called Fyodor, a White Russian in Paris who may be spying for the Bolsheviks, the Nazis, the Tsarists - or none of them. This vain, enigmatic, politically astute man is wonderfully played by Serge Renko, a dead-ringer for Henry Fonda and just as compelling a screen presence. But we only see this spy talk about what he does. As a result, we share his wife's mounting suspicions. \"I don't show a spy at work,\" says Rohmer. \"Rather, a woman who asks herself whether her husband is a spy. This is why Triple Agent relies on words rather than action.\" </p> <p>The film resembles a late Henry James novel, where even our interpretations of what the characters are saying or doing are untrustworthy. It doesn't allow us to make easy moral judgments and is thus akin to almost all of Rohmer's earlier films. </p> <p>Triple Agent takes place in a Parisian milieu that would have been familiar to the teenage Rohmer. \"What I remember, more than anything else, was the World Exhibition in Paris in 1937 that seemed to reflect the political climate of the time. Each nation had a pavilion on the opposite side of the Seine to the Eiffel Tower.\" Very slowly, Rohmer pulls himself to his feet, comes round his desk and hobbles, hunchbacked, towards the film poster on the opposite wall so he can point out a detail. He is wearing worn Reeboks and jeans, with only the sartorial touch of a cravat to suggest a dignified Frenchman. \"On the poster you can see on the left the German pavilion. On the right there is the Soviet one - two bombastic totalitarian powers facing each other.\" </p> <p>Paris made Rohmer. He first became a reporter there and subsequently a novelist, before being captivated by film at Henri Langlois's Cin\u00e9math\u00e8que Fran\u00e7aise after the war. Such was its impact that he changed his name from Jean-Marie Maurice Scherer. \"Eric\" was a homage to the great German director Erich von Stroheim, while Rohmer was an allusion to Sax Rohmer, who wrote the Fu Manchu novels. He was editor-in-chief at Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma in its Nouvelle Vague heyday from 1956-63. </p> <p>Then, in the 1960s, he turned to making films full-time. Long before Kryzysztof Kieslowski, Rohmer made films in cycles, creating a series of six so-called Moral Tales, though he found success only towards the end of the decade with The Collector, My Night with Maude and Claire's Knee. They dealt with the virtues of self-restraint and characteristically featured glamorous women who were more intelligent, complex and engaging than his men. In the 1980s he produced a second cycle dealing with deception, called Comedies and Proverbs, the most human and charming of which was The Green Ray (1986). </p> <p>Now, 54 years after his cinematic debut, Rohmer is still making cherishable films. What will the evidently frail director do next? \"I still plan to make films. But I never discuss future projects.\" Does he feel any connection to modern French cinema? \"Listen, I am too old to go to the cinema. I'd rather watch things on TV and I prefer to watch old films now.\" </p> <p>Cahiers du Cin\u00e9ma recently claimed French cinema was in crisis, with little of merit coming from new directors. \"People are always talking about crises in cinema. I may have done when I was a journalist. Lots of films are made in France. Are there too many? I can't judge.\" </p> <p>Is there nobody you admire in current French cinema? \"I'm not really aware of people in the current cinema.\" Then he adds wearily: \"There are many film-makers I admire in France, but all of them are dead.\" </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Triple Agent goes on general release on Friday.</p>",
  "John Peel, the veteran DJ who discovered dozens of major bands during a broadcasting career spanning 40 years, has died after suffering a heart attack. <p> Peel, who was 65, was taken ill during a working holiday with his wife, Sheila, in the city of Cuzco, Peru, and never recovered.</p> <p> The Radio 1 controller, Andy Parfitt, described Peel as a \"broadcasting legend\".</p> <p> \"I am deeply saddened by his death, as are all who work at Radio 1,\" he said. </p> <p> \"Walking around the station there is an outpouring of grief and feeling that we want to do something [in tribute]. I am sure in the days and weeks to come we will find a way of doing that on the airwaves.\"</p> <p> \"We are absolutely knocked out here at Radio 1,\" he said. \"He was a joy to work with. We regularly have DJ suppers where we fill the room with our specialist DJs. John would come along and as the evening wore on, people would gather around him almost like a throne listening to his fantastic stories.</p> <p> \"What we find about great broadcasters is that they are completely dedicated to the music. John would seek out the most obscure and most interesting things to him and would play it and talk about it. That's what makes really exciting radio, people saying exactly what they feel, and that's why people loved John. He was real.\"</p> <p> Parfitt said it was always difficult to persuade Peel, who died on a working holiday in Peru, to take time off from the station. \"We persuaded him to take a holiday somewhere he particularly wanted to visit,\" he said.</p> <p> As a tribute to Peel, the first record Radio 1 played after his death was announced on Newsbeat at lunchtime today, was The Undertones' Teenage Kicks, one of the DJ's favourite songs. </p> <p> This was followed by tracks from the White Stripes and the Strokes - two other artists from the recent revival in guitar-based indie music that Peel was very much associated with.</p> <p> The Undertones bass player, Michael Bradley, today said Peel's death had robbed radio and the music industry of one of its greatest voices. </p> <p> \"He was a very funny, very warm man and we will always be grateful for what he did for The Undertones,\" said Bradley.</p> <p> \"Personally, I find it incredible what he did for the band and we always got huge pride out of the fact he said Teenage Kicks was his favourite single,\" he added.</p> <p> Over the last four decades he was renowned for helping to break bands from the Undertones to Siouxsie and the Banshees who were unsigned before he played them.</p> <p> Siouxsie Sioux was a guest DJ on the show last Wednesday when he was on holiday as was Robert Smith, the lead singer of the Cure, a band Peel also championed in the late 70s.</p> <p> \"He always had his finger on the pulse of the music industry and the fact that Radio 1 played the Undertones, the White Stripes and the Strokes today showed just how relevant he remained throughout his career,\" said Bradley.</p> <p> Peel presented the award-winning Radio 4 programme Home Truths as well as a late-night weekday show on Radio 1 and was famous as a champion of new music. </p> <p> Tributes also poured in from BBC bosses - Mark Thompson, the director general, said he was \"shocked and saddened\" by Peel's death. </p> <p> \"He was one of the giants of radio and will be missed not just by everyone at the BBC but by millions of listeners of all ages,\" Mr Thompson said.</p> <p> The BBC director of radio and music, Jenny Abramsky, added: \"John Peel was a unique broadcaster whose influence on Radio 1 could be felt from its very first days. </p> <p> \"He nurtured musicians and listeners alike, introducing them to new sounds.</p> <p> \"His open-minded approach to music was mirrored by his equally generous approach to his audience when he went to Radio 4 to present Home Truths. </p> <p> \"He had a remarkable rapport with all his listeners. Everyone at BBC Radio is devastated by the news. </p> <p> \"John is simply irreplaceable. Our hearts go out to Sheila and his children.\" </p> <p> Peel was a hero not just to generations of listeners who have been flooding the Radio 1 website with heartfelt tributes, but to the younger crop of DJs.</p> <p> \"It feels like John Peel invented Radio 1,\" said one text messager to Radio 1 today. Another said: \"I don't think I have ever been affected so much by the death of someone I have never met.\"</p> <p> Radio 1 DJ Jo Wylie described the presenter as \"one of my favourite men in the whole world. He was an absolute inspiration and simply the don. Everyone at Radio 1 and everyone who has ever met him will testify to that. He is the biggest and saddest loss to everybody.\"</p> <p> Parfitt added: \"John's influence has towered over the development of popular music for nearly four decades and his contribution to modern music and music culture is immeasurable.</p> <p> \"Hopeful bands all over the world sent their demo tapes to John, knowing that he really cared. His commitment and passion for new music only grew stronger over the years. </p> <p> \"In fact, when I last saw him he was engaged in a lively debate with his fellow DJs over the state of new music today. He will be hugely missed.\"</p>",
  "<p>Rupert Murdoch has claimed his Fox News channel is not biased in favour of George Bush and that News Corporation, his global media empire, is a \"fair and balanced\" company. </p> <p>Speaking at the company's annual general meeting in Adelaide, Mr Murdoch insisted Fox News' reporting was more balanced than that of other US networks. </p> <p>\"It's full of Democrats and Republicans, the others only have Democrats. We don't take any position at all,\" Mr Murdoch said in response to a question about Fox's impartiality.</p> <p>\"We're not in the least bit biased, we're a fair and balanced company.\"</p> <p>Mr Murdoch's comments will astonish critics of the notoriously right-wing television network, which was the subject of the controversial US documentary, Outfoxed: Rupert Murdoch's War on Journalism.</p> <p>The film, which accused Fox News of abandoning traditional reporting values and ushering in an era of partisan news coverage, has become a cult classic, topping Amazon.com's list of bestselling DVDs.</p> <p>It alleges presenters are encouraged to accentuate points that might be helpful to the Bush administration, and includes a claim from one former Fox contributor covering news from Iraq that he was ordered to \"keep it positive\" and \"emphasise all the good we're doing\".</p> <p>But Mr Murdoch admitted News Corp newspapers, which include the New York Post as well as the Times, the Sun and the News of the World, had supported Mr Bush's foreign policy and said they would continue to do so.</p> <p>\"With our newspapers, we have indeed supported Bush's foreign policy and we remain that way,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Murdoch gave a clue to his view of John Kerry, when asked what would happen to the US economy if Mr Bush's Democratic challenger won the election. </p> <p>\"I have no idea. He says he has plans but he won't tell us what they are,\" Mr Murdoch replied. </p> <p>He said financial markets would probably respond more favourably if Bush retained his presidency. </p> <p>\"I think you'll get a lift to the market and you'll get continuation of his tax reduction program, which will help, and interest rates will stay low, probably,\" Mr Murdoch said.</p> <p>Fox News was widely criticised for its cheerleading during last year's war in Iraq. Its star interviewer, Bill O'Reilly, told viewers the US should go in and \"splatter\" the Iraqis, while US soldiers were referred to as \"heroes\" and \"liberators\".</p> <p>Ofcom's predecessor, the Independent Television Commission, launched an inquiry into the channel amid allegations of bias.</p> <p>But it concluded the channel did not contravene its regulations on impartiality.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "Welcome to the Wrap, Guardian Unlimited's round-up of the best of the day's papers. <p><b>WINNER AND LOSERS STOKE GAMBLING FEARS</b></p> <p>The Wrap doubts that William Hill is taking bets on the likelihood of the gambling bill clearing parliament. But the chances of this piece of legislation becoming law are looking worse every day.</p> <p>The Daily Mail, which is energetically pursuing its Kill The Casinos Bill campaign, enlists Michael Winner to the cause. \"Mumsy died broke. She was literally hooked on casinos,\" the director explains. Winner's mother, he writes, lost GBP35m in the casino at Cannes. \"It was supposed to have been my inheritance,\" he adds regretfully.</p> <p>According to the Times, Tessa Jowell, the culture secretary, is already being urged by her cabinet colleagues to establish a cap on the number of new casinos or restrict them to five or six zones. But Tony Blair defended the bill at his monthly press conference yesterday. \"Denying he gambled himself, except politically, Mr Blair said 24-hour gambling was a fact of life in Britain, whether it was horses, dogs, football pools or on the internet,\" the Telegraph reports. He spoke of \"20 to 40\" new casinos and said they would be confined to areas in need of regeneration.</p> <p>The Guardian weighs in with a poll suggesting that just over half of voters (53%) oppose new casinos, with a third in favour. \"There is, however, some evidence that the jibe by the culture secretary that her critics had a 'whiff of snobbery' about them has some foundation, with the poll showing that her gambling bill is a popular measure among skilled working class voters.\" Seventy-three percent of Britons \"have had a flutter\" in the past year, it emerges.</p> <p>\"'Snobbery' is the panic-button word of Labour ministers,\" writes Max Hastings in the paper. \"The casinos bill troubles many of us for the same reason as the national lottery ... I love opera and ballet and the great collections. But I feel a twinge of bourgeois discomfort that the money for upgrading our arts institutions has come from people least able to afford it ... The more 'accessible' gambling becomes, the more likely it is that ordinary families will suffer temptations and miseries that can prove crippling to their happiness, and are best kept as inaccessible as possible. The casinos bill stinks.\"</p> <p>Nonsense, says David Aaronovitch: the debate over the merits of a few more casinos is beginning to take on the characteristics of a \"moral panic\". \"It's unlikely that the Mail and the Guardian - when they agree with each other - will be right.\"</p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/gambling/story/0,15248,1336129,00.html\">Public rejects Blair's casino plans</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,3604,1335841,00.html\">David Aaronovitch</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/comment/story/0,3604,1335925,00.html\">Max Hastings</a> * <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1329261,00.html\">Times: Chaos over casinos</a> * <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/10/26/nbets26.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2004/10/26/ixhome.html\">Telegraph: Blair stands firm</a></p> <p><b>KERRY GAINING PACE</b></p> <p>\"The unmistakable sense yesterday was that Mr Kerry had the wind in his sails, pulling slightly ahead or closing in some of the most important states,\" reports the Telegraph. The Democratic candidate was helped by the presence of Bill Clinton at a Pennsylvania rally and by the revelation that 380 tonnes of high explosives went missing in Iraq after the invasion last year.</p> <p>\"The huge facility, called Al Qaqaa, was supposed to be under US military control but is now a no man's land, still picked over by looters as recently as Sunday,\" reports the Herald Tribune. Condoleezza Rice apparently learnt of the disappearance within the past few weeks.</p> <p>The missing explosives are powerful enough to produce bombs capable of destroying aeroplanes and buildings: less than half a kilo of similar material was enough to bring down Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie in 1988.</p> <p>\"Yesterday, the [International Atomic Energy Agency] made clear that the US, as leader of the coalition in Iraq, had been repeatedly warned of the importance of making sure the stockpiles were safe,\" reports the Independent. Bill Clinton \"moved more slowly and spoke less forcefully than he used to\", says Julian Borger in the Guardian. \"For tens of thousands of roaring fans who jammed several city blocks beyond [Love] Park, however, all Mr Clinton had to do was speak.\" The Kerry campaign hopes his endorsement can win back some of the black American voters who have gravitated to George Bush.</p> <p>William Safire, writing in the Herald Tribune, urges Jews to back Mr Bush: \"It is Bush who has the four-year record of standing up for Israel's right of self-defence.\"</p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uselections2004/story/0,13918,1336035,00.html\">Clinton's boost for Kerry</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2004/10/25/news/tnt.html\">IHT: Tons of explosives are missing in Iraq</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml;sessionid=DNIKGRDNWNOXLQFIQMGSM54AVCBQWJVC?xml=/news/2004/10/26/wus26.xml&amp;sSheet=/portal/2004/10/26/ixportaltop.html\">Telegraph: Clinton adds heart</a><br> * <a href=\"http://news.independent.co.uk/world/middle_east/story.jsp?story=576048\">Independent: Bombshell for Bush</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2004/10/25/opinion/edsafire.html\">IHT: William Safire</a></p> <p><b>SHOT BURGLAR JAILED</b></p> <p>Reading the Daily Express can be a depressing experience, but the paper has heartening news for its readers today: \"AT LAST, A JUDGE BACKS MAN WHO SHOT A BURGLAR.\"</p> <p>The Telegraph also leads with the story. The burglar in question, who had stolen a mechanical digger, five shotguns, a longbow, arrows and a crossbow during earlier raids on the same property, suffered pellet wounds in his leg after 73-year-old Kenneth Faulkner shot him. He was jailed for seven years yesterday.</p> <p>\"Are they saying we can all shoot burglars?\" one of the burglar's family asked yesterday.

  "Bill Clinton, the perennial Comeback Kid of American politics, returned from his sick bed to centre stage yesterday, proving that his ailing, quadruply-bypassed heart is still in the fight. <p>But it was a much thinner, frailer man who took the stage alongside John Kerry in Philadelphia's Love Park than the vigorous leader who dominated the last American decade. He had come back from the brink of political death many times, but this has been an narrow escape of the real thing. </p> <p>Backstage, he joked he was \"the healthiest man here\", but barely seven weeks after surgery, he moved more slowly and spoke less forcefully than he used to. For tens of thousands of roaring fans who jammed several city blocks beyond the park, however, all Mr Clinton had to do was speak. It was more rock concert than political rally. </p> <p>\"I can't stop looking at him. I've been looking at him for 10 years on my refrigerator,\" Malyn Rothstein, a diehard fan from nearby Doylestown, said. She had woken up at 3.30am to get in line for the lunchtime show. \"He looks kind of thin, but he's still got a spring in his step and he's still got a mis chievous look in his eye,\" In-Jee Lee, another breathless female supporter, insisted. </p> <p>The former president-superstar, the man the smitten political press used to call Elvis, drew strength from the crowd's adoration. Love Park, in the shadow of the white-stone city hall, was an apt venue, and the love was clearly mutual. \"If this isn't good for my heart, I don't know what is,\" he said. </p> <p>The speech was short, and dwelt largely on the facts and figures of Pennsylvania's prosperity under his administration and its subsequent decline in the Bush era. But it was also a warm endorsement of Senator Kerry as the man to bring the good times back. </p> <p>\"From time to time, I've been called the Comeback Kid. In eight days, John Kerry is going to make America the comeback country,\" Mr Clinton said. In a clear sign that the top reaches of the Democratic party are ready for a legal fight on and after polling day, Mr Clinton warned that the Republicans would try to suppress the Democratic vote on November 2. </p> <p>\"It worked so well in Florida, they thought they'd try it elsewhere,\" he said, but he urged the Democratic faithful to overcome any obstacles between them and the ballot box. </p> <p>Citing \"one of Clinton's rules of politics\", he declared: \"If one candidate is trying to scare you, and the other's trying to get you to think; if one is appealing to your fears, and the other is appealing to your hopes - it seems to me you ought to vote for the person who wants you to think and hope.\" </p> <p>The speech lasted barely quarter of an hour, and his voice strained to reach the furthest reaches of Love Park. But it was a forgiving crowd. If anything, the newly muted Clinton helped Mr Kerry, who was next at the microphone. The candidate, 60, came across as vigorous and dynamic by comparison to the 58-year-old former president, symbolising the passing of a baton. Mr Kerry hammered away at the \"incompetence\" of the administration, highlighting the high explosives left unguarded and stolen in Iraq. \"George W Bush has failed the test as commander-in-chief,\" he thundered. </p> <p>The differences in style between the two men were never so evident. Kerry is a brass band, full of pomp and circumstance, sometimes inspiring but marching along to a predictable beat. Clinton is a mixture of jazz and the blues. Smaller and weaker he may be, but he still has the capacity to make a crowd feel he is taking them into his confidence. </p> <p>He conjured up out of the cold Philadelphia air some of the Democratic party's old-time religion that the true believers had been sorely missing. That matters particularly to black Americans, who retain a special affection for him, but cannot summon up the same enthusiasm for his successor </p> <p>As president, Mr Clinton used to draw over 90% of the black vote. A recent poll suggested as many as 18% of African Americans were backing Mr Bush, a dangerous trend for Mr Kerry. Mr Clinton's principal task will be to bring them back into the Democratic fold and make them feel it is worth voting. </p> <p>\"President Clinton at least tries his best for us. We're hoping that Kerry will fill that niche,\" Jonathan Foxx said. </p> <p>Mr Clinton flew to Florida last night to do just that. Mike McCurry, his former spokesman working for Mr Kerry, said Mr Clinton's skills would be used sparingly. </p> <p>\"He's going to Florida and we've got him down to do three or four other things. After that it will be on the sufferance of the doctors,\" he said. </p> <p>The Democrats have such faith in the former president that if Mr Kerry loses next Tuesday, Mr Clinton's ill-timed heart problems will be seen as one of the great what-ifs of the campaign. If he wins, his Lazarus-like return will no doubt be interpreted as the saving grace.</p>",

  "<p>There have been no shortage of insane, over ambitious ideas on the internet. Most of them never make it further than the pub they are conceived in. Some generate hype but quickly fall flat on their face. Others survive, but prove to be minnows rather than the giants they set out to be. However, every so often, one sneaks through. </p> <p>Wikipedia is one of the rare ones that made it. Even by the admission of its founder, the 38-year-old technology entrepreneur Jimmy Wales, it was a \"completely insane idea\": a free online encyclopedia that anyone can contribute to and anyone can edit. There is no editor, no army of proof readers and fact checkers; in fact, no full-time staff at all. It is, in other words, about as far from the traditional idea of an encyclopedia as you can get. </p> <p>There are dozens of reasons why it shouldn't work, and it is still far from perfect, but in less than four years, it has grown to have more than 1 million entries written in 100 languages from Albanian to Zulu. </p> <p>To its fans, it is a fantastic research resource - albeit one that you should use with caution; and an incredible example of what can be achieved by collaboration and cooperation over the internet. To its detractors - mostly those from the traditional world of encyclopedias and librarianship, it is barely worthy of the label \"encyclopedia\". </p> <p>To put Wikipedia's achievements in numerical context, at the same time it was celebrating the publishing of its one millionth entry (a Hebrew article on the Kazakhstan flag) in less than four years, the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography launched its latest edition. It had taken 12 years to complete, yet contained a comparatively tiddly 55,000 biographies. It also cost some \u00a325m to create. Wikipedia has so far been bankrolled by Wales, but the total cost so far is still around \u00a3300,000. </p> <p>The current Encyclopedia Britannica has 44m words of text. Wikipedia already has more than 250m words in it. Britannica's most recent edition has 65,000 entries in print and 75,000 entries online. Wikipedia's English site has some 360,000 entries and is growing every day. </p> <p>But numbers mean nothing if the quality is no good. And this is where the arguments start. </p> <p>\"Theoretically, it's a lovely idea,\" says librarian and internet consultant Philip Bradley, \"but practically, I wouldn't use it; and I'm not aware of a single librarian who would. The main problem is the lack of authority. With printed publications, the publishers have to ensure that their data is reliable, as their livelihood depends on it. But with something like this, all that goes out the window.\" </p> <p>Wales responds by acknowledging that Wikipedia's model leaves it anything but error free (something they make clear on the site) but he also points to an article in a German technology magazine this month, which compares Wikipedia with two established, traditional digital encyclopedias: Brockhaus and Microsoft's Encarta. All three were tested on breadth, depth, and comprehensibility of content, ease of searching, and quality of multimedia content. Wikipedia won hands down. </p> <p>Dan Gillmor, the Silicon Valley commentator and author of We the Media, is one of many independent fans: \"I don't think anyone is saying Wikipedia is an absolute replacement for a traditional encyclopedia. But in the topics I know something about, I've found Wikipedia to be as accurate as any other source I've found. </p> <p>The roots of Wikipedia lie in the open source software movement, which took off in the early 90s with the development of Linux, a free version of the Unix computer operating system. This was developed in the mid-90s and posted on to the net, giving anyone the right to adapt and improve it. It has become the only real challenger to Microsoft's dominance of the market. </p> <p>The programmer and author Eric Raymond analysed the Linux phenomenon in his 1997 paper, The Cathedral and the Bazaar, which has since become the manifesto for the open source movement. Raymond compared the traditional school of software development to cathedrals, which meant they were \"carefully crafted, by individual wizards or small bands of mages (magicians) working in splendid isolation\". </p> <p>The open source community he wrote, \"seemed to resemble a great babbling bazaar of differing agendas and approaches ... out of which a coherent and stable system could seemingly emerge only by a succession of miracles.\" </p> <p>The critical law of the bazaar school of publishing, Raymond claimed, was that \"given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow\". And this is at the heart of how Wikipedia works. Because it has so many people swarming over it all the time errors and abuses of the system are all quickly picked up. </p> <p>Indeed, research by IBM showed that acts of \"vandalism\" (ie people deliberately writing either rubbish or abusive comments) were normally cleared from the site within five minutes. </p> <p>For example, at 23.23 on September 27 this year, a user under the name Hitler edited the entry on Judaism by proposing that it be put forward for a \"Vote For Deletion\" (ie it should be removed entirely from Wikipedia). He summarised his edit as \"HOLOCAUST LOL\" (Laughing Out Loud). At 23.29 another user removed this from the page. And at 23.44, \"Hitler\" was been banned indefinitely from using the site. </p> <p>But, this isn't always the case. One blogger, who goes under the name of Frozen North, made a point of deliberately making a number of minor errors on a number of entries at the start of September. He made five changes and it took at least 20 hours for them to be changed. Some of his implanted errors were there for five days before he removed them himself. </p> <p>As Wales admits: \"The average quality of the entries is pretty good, but on any given day, any given entry might be up or down.\" </p> <p>The truth is that Wikipedia is continuously evolving. There are now around 3,000 new entries being added each day (about 700-800 of which are in English); and as the site has got bigger, so has the amount of editing that takes place on it. In September this year, there were an average of 11 edits per article. The entry on the Israel-Palestinian conflict has been edited more than 250 times this year alone. </p> <p>The most contested entry, though, is that of George Bush, which has caused so much controversy that it has been frozen from editing. It had had more than 500 edits between August and the start of October, and there are more than 13 pages of discussion about the entry. </p> <p>The truth is that Wikipedia reveals what is normally hidden in an encyclopedia: the countless decisions that lie behind each entry. The only difference is that in Wikipedia, the decision-making never stops and the debates are often robust to say the least. </p> <p>Wales says an entry in his encyclopedia is \"like a sausage: you might like the taste of it, but you don't necessarily want to see how it's made\". </p> <p>It might seem like anarchy. And, given the lack of central control, it technically is. However, there are three elements that make it work. </p> <p>The first is its ownership, and lack of commercial imperative. The site is manned by volunteers, and now owned by a foundation, which means people willingly give their time and intellectual property to the venture. It manages to run on less than $100,000 a year. </p> <p>The second is that the overriding editorial principle that all articles should show a \"Neutral point of view\" (NpoV). According to Wales, this is as much \"a social technique for getting people to work together\" as it is an editorial policy. </p> <p>The third - and perhaps most critical - has been the evolution of an incredibly intricate and democratic social order to keep this vast sprawling project in order. </p> <p>There are hundreds of thousands of \"Wikipedians\" who have contributed or edited articles. But the core community, according to Wales, is about 200 people who, by now, know each other quite well. Outside this inner-inner circle is a core of about 2,000 people who make more than 100 edits each in the last month. Beyond this, you have around 10,000 people who will have made more than five edits. There are administrators, bureaucrats, stewards and developers all with different levels of technical and administrative authority. </p> <p>Where individuals get into a dispute, such as an \"edit war\" where they are constantly undoing each others changes, or just an endless debate over a particular point, they can hold a vote on the issue. If this doesn't work, there is a formal mediation process, and if this fails, the case can go to an arbitration committee. In very extreme cases, Wales himself intervenes in his role as \"benign dictator\". </p> <p>Random acts of violence - such as Hitler's activities above - are not a major problem, ac cording to Wales, because they are clear to spot and obvious to redeem. </p> <p>\"When someone just writes 'fuck, fuck, fuck', we just fix it, laugh and move on,\" he says, \"but the difficult social issues, are the borderline cases - people who do some good work, but who are also a pain in the neck.\" </p> <p>One such case was a contributor called Wik. \"He violated some rules, but he also had a lot of supporters, so there was a huge debate over what we should do. Eventually, the arbitration committee decided he should be banned for a week.\" </p> <p>There are rewards as well as punishments. Those who have done good work - either for editing, or for dealing with vandalism - are awarded \"BarnStars\" to put on their profile page. </p> <p>This entire order is all there for everyone to see online. Policies and strategies are posted online, discussed and voted on. While the content develops automatically and anarchically, nothing happens to the social structure of Wikipedia without the consent of the core community. </p> <p>All of this, however, fails to impress their rivals over at Encyclopedia Britannica. During a 20-minute conference call, two of their most senior editors and their head of publicity, acknowledge that Wikipedia is a remarkable phenomenon, before getting their knives out. </p> <p>Executive editor, Ted Pappas, is the most extreme in his criticism: \"The premise of Wikipedia is that continuous improvement will lead to perfection, that premise is completely unproven ... with many of the pieces you don't know who it's written by, and who the administrators are ... one of the administrators over seeing the political coverage openly encourages people to vote for John Kerry ... 30,000 articles were created by a bot [an automated program that goes round causing havoc] ... hyperlinks, bulletpoints and cut-and-paste press releases do not an encyclopedia entry make.\" </p> <p>Editor-in-chief Dale Hoiberg is no less damning: \"People write on things they're interested in, and so many subjects don't get covered; and news events get covered in great detail. The entry on Hurricane Frances is five times the length of that on Chinese art, and the entry on Coronation Street is twice as long as the article on Tony Blair.\" </p> <p>Wales is quite sanguine when confronted with this assault. Pointing out that Wikipedia is still less than four years old and still improving. And, that he is looking at new techniques to improve the quality. </p> <p>His current plan is to create a \"stable version\" of some entries: in other words, one that has been fact-checked by one of a number of approved editors (although they are still working on the details of this). It is a radical change, but Wales is willing to do whatever it takes to give his project the authority it needs. </p> <p>The truth is that Wikipedia is far from finished, but even now, flaws and all, it is already one of the wonders of the digital age; and a pin-up for a growing movement that sees the internet evolving as a true \"citizens' medium\". However, Wales and his community of volunteers are not resting on their laurels. He is in negotiations to print part of the content, and distribute it in Africa as part of their ambition to \"put a free encyclopedia in the hands of every person on the planet\". Insane and over-ambitious? Definitely. But after everything they have achieved in the last three-and-a-half years, you would be equally insane to bet against them.</p>",
  "The war in Iraq returned to centre stage in the US presidential election yesterday when John Kerry assailed the \"unbelievable incompetence\" of the Bush administration after it emerged that more than 340 tonnes of explosives had been looted from a storage plant in Iraq. <p>The conventional explosives, powerful enough to demolish buildings and bring down airliners or to detonate a nuclear device, have been removed from al-Qaqaa storage site, a former Iraqi military site near Baghdad that was once part of Saddam Hussein's nuclear programme. It was supposed to be under US guard. </p> <p>Mr Kerry, who began the day in the swing state of New Hampshire before joining former president Bill Clinton in Pennsylvania, took advantage of the news to stress that Mr Bush's administration was ill-prepared for the aftermath of the invasion of Iraq. </p> <p>\"Terrorists could use this material to kill our troops, our people, blow up airplanes and level buildings,\" he told a rally in New Hampshire. </p> <p>Calling the news \"one of the great blunders of the Bush policy in Iraq\", he said: \"George W Bush, who talks tough and brags about making America safer, has once again failed to deliver ... The unbelievable incompetence of this president and his administration has put our troops at risk.\" </p> <p>He had \"failed the essential test of any commander in chief, to keep America safe\". </p> <p>The administration was told a month ago that the explosives had disappeared, the New York Times and CBS television, which broke the story, reported. </p> <p>The national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, was informed, but it was not clear whether President Bush was told, the paper said. </p> <p>Mohamed ElBaradei, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, reported the disappearance to the UN security council last night. </p> <p>\"The most immediate concern here is that these explosives could have fallen into the wrong hands,\" an IAEA spokeswoman told Associated Press. </p> <p>\"We do not know what happened to the explosives or when they were looted.\" </p> <p>In the run-up to the war the IAEA warned the US about the presence of the explosives and urged its forces to secure the base, the New York Times said. </p> <p>An internal IAEA memorandum warned last May that terrorists might be helping themselves \"to the greatest explosives bonanza in history\". </p> <p>An official of the Iraqi defence ministry, who asked not to be named, said last night: \"The US forces failed to secure our borders and failed to impose order after the invasion. </p> <p>\"Is it any surprise that they overlooked the stocks at al-Qaqaa?\" </p> <p>The news distracted from the Bush campaign's plan to devote the day to highlighting national security. </p> <p>Campaigning in the swing state of Colorado, Mr Bush again said he was the candidate best suited to make America safe. </p> <p>\"John Kerry has no vision for fighting and winning the war on terror, so he is basing his attacks on the headlines he wakes up to each day,\" said campaign spokesman Steve Schmidt. </p> <p>A Kerry campaign aide, Joe Lockhart, said that President Bush \"must answer for what may be the most grave ... mistake in a tragic series of blunders. How did they fail to secure ... tonnes of known deadly explosives despite clear warnings from the [IAEA]? </p> <p>\"The Bush administration knew where this stockpile was, but took no action to secure the site.\" </p> <p>The latest polls showed the two still neck and neck yesterday, giving Mr Bush just a single percentage point lead. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> The US chief justice, William Rehnquist, has thyroid cancer, the supreme court announced yesterday. He underwent a tracheotomy at the weekend but expected to be back at work next week.</p>"
