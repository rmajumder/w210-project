  "Like all Brits, I'm a bit of a satire snob. After all, when it comes to razor-sharp political and social comment, we're the best in the world, right? Other nations just don't \"get\" irony. Your average American, say, wouldn't spot a parody if you painted it blue and surrounded it in neon lights. Yeah, right. Now look around you. Jonathan Swift is dead. The Spitting Image puppets have all been melted down. Ali G has jumped not just the shark but the entire Atlantic and Private Eye is still re-using jokes that weren't even funny in the 80s. The sad fact is, British satire has passed on. It is no more. It has ceased to be. And what's even worse is that it's the Americans - the Americans! - who have picked up the baton. <p>Once the land of the irony-free, the United States is now the only place to go if you're looking for first-rate topical humour. And right up there at the top of the tree, alongside old favourites like The Onion and The Simpsons, is The Daily Show. Presented by the slick-haired Jon Stewart (pictured), The Daily Show is disturbingly similar in format to Channel 4's ill-fated 11 O'Clock Show, combining topical studio-based rants with irreverent on-the-spot presenters. The only difference is that the Daily Show is funny. Really funny. Whether grilling Senator John Kerry on how much commission his wife makes from ketchup sales or using video trickery to make George W Bush interview himself, the show is always bang on the money. And fortunately for us satire-starved Brits, dozens of the best Daily Show moments are available online at <a href=\"http://www.comedycentral.com\">www.comedycentral.com</a>. </p> <p>Just try not to get too jealous when you watch them. After all, the Americans may be funnier than us now, but at least we still know how to pronounce the word \"herb\".</p>",
  "<b> Los Angeles Times</b> <br> Editorial, October 6 <p>\"Remember that Jim Carrey movie in which he plays a lawyer who can't help but tell the truth, and it keeps getting him in trouble? On Monday, a similar affliction seemed to have struck two central architects of the Bush administration's Iraq policy. </p> <p>\"Addressing the council on foreign relations, the defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, veered starkly off message when asked about the alleged ties between al-Qaida and Saddam Hussein. 'To my knowledge, I have not seen any strong, hard evidence that links the two,' he said, countering the White House's much discredited story. Elsewhere on this day of refreshing candor, Paul Bremer, George Bush's proconsul in Iraq until late July, conceded that 'we never had enough troops on the ground' ... </p> <p>\"Both men hastened to spin their truths, to show they are loyal team-players. But what this administration suffers from is too much blind loyalty and not enough probing skepticism from high officials ... Monday's unexpected burst of candor is handy at this point mostly for 'I told you so' score-settling. It can't undo Iraq's continued violence and chaos. Unfortunately, some things are not much better late than never.\" </p> <p><b> Gulf News</b><br> Editorial, United Arab Emirates, October 6 </p> <p>\"Like slime oozing out of the quagmire that Iraq has become, some senior members of the Bush administration are acceding to the charges made all along by the opponents to the pre-emptive invasion of Iraq ... Mr Bush now has to defend the turnabout of his senior staff ... Could it be that some of the Bush administration see the writing on the wall, and want to put the record straight, before others?\" </p> <p><b> Independent</b><br> Editorial, October 6 </p> <p>\"In electoral terms, Mr Rumsfeld's was a gaffe of the highest order. But it was also the truth. And ... US voters are almost for the first time taking serious notice. The war is now the central issue in the campaign ... </p> <p>\"Mr Rumsfeld's frantic efforts to limit the damage ... suggest, too, that his mistimed candour was more than a gaffe. It was the first real sign that Mr Bush's highly polished and and well-oiled machine conceals a certain fragility. Under pressure, it could crack. Now that they have identified where Mr Bush is vulnerable, John Kerry and John Edwards must keep up the attack.\" </p> <p><b> Daily Mirror</b><br> Editorial, October 6 </p> <p>\"Since September 11, the American people understandably want everything possible done to smash al-Qaida. But invading and destabilising Iraq has strengthened, not weakened, its murderous fanatics. Mr Rumsfeld has as good as admitted the White House is fighting the war on terrorism in the wrong way, in the wrong country against the wrong enemy.\" </p> <p><b> South China Morning Post</b><br> Editorial, October 6 </p> <p>\"Without more credibility, the US faces an uphill battle in winning commitments of troops, humanitarian aid or other support ... Mr Rumsfeld's slip of the tongue and quick reversal will not help ... </p> <p>\"No one would expect the hawkish Mr Rumsfeld to stray from the administration's continuing insistence of a connection between al-Qaida and Saddam ... [But] no matter who wins next month, the subject will have to be revisited. If the US wants the world to follow its lead in democratising the Middle East and in stopping rogues who wish to acquire dangerous weapons, its leaders will have to come clean on this vital topic.\" </p> <p><b> Wall Street Journal</b><br> Editorial, October 6 </p> <p>\"Mr Bremer was given a tough job in Iraq, and he's taken a lot of unfair criticism for some of the things he did right ... But he is hardly helping the cause of victory now by criticising his former colleagues, especially in a way that obscures the hard lessons we've learned in Iraq in the past 18 months.\"</p>",

  "For years, people have complained there are too many (other) people in the world. Now we panic about the effects on the young population of falling birth rates, fast food, cheap booze, fags and recreational drugs. At the same time we fret about the pensions crisis. Perhaps the solution is simple. Junk food, fags, booze, fast cars, dangerous sports and unsafe sex should be banned (or rationed) until retirement. After that they should be compulsory. <b><br>Iain Climie<br></b> Observer, October 3 <p>In a rare interview in Afghanistan in May 1998 with John Miller of ABC News, Osama bin Laden spoke of the poor opinion held in the Islamic world of the American will to fight.

Pundits on television say endlessly that we should sit down, talk with these people; find out what they want. But we already know what they want. Bin Laden and al-Qaida take the long view.

  "The race for the White House turned aggressive and often personal at a vice-presidential debate in which Dick Cheney sought to drive home his highly controversial position on Saddam Hussein's alleged links to terrorism. <p>Fighting to regain ground lost to the Democrats in the aftermath of last Thursday's meeting between George Bush and John Kerry, the vice-president maintained that the Iraq war had been \"exactly the right thing to do\" because of an \"established Iraqi track record with terror\". </p> <p>But his attempts to portray John Edwards as weak on the threats facing the US provoked a fierce counterattack from his challenger, creating an openly hostile atmosphere that rarely let up during the 90-minute debate. </p> <p>In some of the campaign's sharpest rhetoric so far, Mr Edwards all but accused his opponent of lying, charging the Bush administration with \"complete distortion\" and \"not being straight with the American people\". </p> <p>The high-octane confrontation - a debate that ranged from Iraq to tax cuts, unemployment and Aids - provided much to bolster the convictions of all voters. Commentators scored it a draw, but that merely piles more pressure on the presidential candidates when they meet for a second debate tomorrow night. </p> <p>Vice-presidential debates are normally seen as sideshows to the main event, but the confrontation assumed an unusual degree of importance after President Bush's poor showing last Thursday. He scowled through Mr Kerry's responses, and within days his lead in the opinion polls had vanished. </p> <p>Contradictory overnight polls reflected the fine balance of Tuesday night's debate. A CBS survey of undecided voters gave the night to Mr Edwards by 41% to 28%. But an ABC poll of registered voters reached an opposite verdict, by 43% to 35%, though that result was affected by the fact that more Republicans than Democrats tuned in. </p> <p>The reasons for invading Iraq and the handling of the war's aftermath prompted the night's most strongly worded exchanges, even as the publication of the Iraq Survey Group's final report on weapons of mass destruction threatened to further undermine the White House case for war. </p> <p>Addressing Mr Cheney directly, the North Carolina senator said: \"There is no connection between the attacks of September 11 and Saddam Hussein. The 9/11 commission has said it. Your own secretary of state has said it. And you've gone around the country suggesting that there is some connection. There is not.\" </p> <p>Mr Cheney said he had never sought to link Saddam to the attacks. But Iraq, he maintained, had been \"the most likely nexus between the terrorists and weapons of mass destruction\". </p> <p>He added: \"The biggest threat we face today is the possibility of terrorists smuggling a nuclear weapon or a biological agent into one of our own cities and threatening the lives of hundreds of thousands of Americans. What we did in Iraq was exactly the right thing to do. If I had to recommend it all over again, I would ... exactly the same course of action.\" </p> <p>Accusing his opponents of altering their positions on the war to improve Mr Kerry's chances of being selected as the Democratic nominee, Mr Cheney said: \"If they couldn't stand up to pressures that Howard Dean represented, how can we expect them to stand up to al-Qaida?\" There was no indication at all, he said, that Mr Kerry had \"the conviction to successfully carry through on the war on terror\". </p> <p>Mr Edwards used a post-debate rally to seize on one highly personal attack that could yet come to haunt Mr Cheney. The vice-president chairs the Senate, yet he claimed he had never met his opponent before; in fact, the pair had met at least twice previously. Mr Edwards, before a cheering crowd at Cleveland's Case Western Reserve University, said his rival was \"still not being straight with the American people\". </p> <p>The only vice-presidential debate of the race had been previewed as a meeting between Darth Vader and Batman's sidekick, Robin, and the two candidates performed true to their characters. Mr Cheney was downbeat and occasionally contemptuous of his opponent, declining to address much of his criticism over Halliburton - such as Mr Edwards's observation that \"while he was CEO ... they paid millions of dollars in fines for providing false information on their company\". Mr Cheney dismissed the attack as \"a smokescreen\", and pointed viewers to a website - although the address he gave was incorrect, and led instead to an anti-Bush site run by the philanthropist George Soros. </p> <p>Mr Edwards, meanwhile, kept his boyish smile, and finished his performance with a homespun vision of \"the bright light of America\", which he said was currently \"flickering\". Seeking to neutralise charges of inexperience, he suggested: \"A longresume does not equal good judgment.\" </p> <p>The debate's format had been seen as a victory for the Cheney team: the two candidates sat at a semicircular desk, with the moderator, the public television host Gwen Ifill, sitting opposite them in the middle. It was an arrangement in which Mr Cheney, the former chief executive, seemed exquisitely comfortable, and which prevented Mr Edwards, the former trial lawyer, from pacing the stage. </p> <p>Frenetic post-debate spinning by campaign strategists provided one indicator that the evening really had been a tie: each team claimed that its man had won. By contrast, in Florida last week, Bush strategists went into damage limitation mode, proclaiming that confrontation a draw. </p> <p>Mr Bush's campaign manager, Ken Mehlman, told the Guardian that Mr Cheney was saying that \"in a world where 19 people with boxcutters can kill 3,000 Americans in the course of 20 minutes, allowing to remain in power a brutal dictator who defied the world, who had a weapons of mass destruction capability ... [this] wasn't acceptable and wasn't safe\". </p> <p>He added: \"The Kerry-Edwards worldview says, only deal with the immediate risk. Our strategy says in a post-9/11 world, you've got to deal not only with the immediate risk, but risks before they materialise.\" </p> <p>But Tad Devine, chief strategist for the Kerry-Edwards campaign, argued that \"Cheney needed to stop the momentum, and he didn't ... Cheney demonstrated that he has the wrong experience ... What did Dick Cheney's experience get us? A war in Iraq with no plan to win the peace.\" </p> <p><b>Tit for tat</b></p> <p><b> Cheney</b> What we did in Iraq was exactly the right thing to do. If I had to recommend it all over again, I would recommend exactly the same course of action. The world is far safer today because Saddam Hussein is in jail. </p> <p><b> Edwards</b> Mr Vice-President, you are still not being straight with the American people ... there is no connection between the attacks of September 11 and Saddam Hussein. The 9/11 commission said it. Your own secretary of state said it. And you've gone around the country suggesting that there is some connection. There is not. </p> <p><b> Cheney</b> They've got a very limited view ... it's a consistent pattern over time of always being on the wrong side of defence issues. A little tough talk in the midst of a campaign, or as part of a presidential debate, cannot obscure a record of 30 years of being on the wrong side of defence issues. </p> <p><b> Edwards</b> Someone did get it wrong. But it wasn't John Kerry and John Edwards. They got it wrong. When we had Osama bin Laden cornered, they left the job to the Afghan warlords. </p> <p><b> Cheney</b> Your rhetoric, senator, would be a lot more credible if there was a record to back it up. There isn't. </p> <p><b> Edwards</b> One thing that's very clear is that a long resume does not equal good judgment. </p> <p><b> Edwards</b> While he was CEO of Halliburton, they paid millions of dollars in fines for providing false information on their company, just like Enron and Ken Lay. They did business with Libya and Iran, two sworn enemies of the United States. </p> <p><b> Cheney </b> Well, the reason they keep mentioning Halliburton is because they're trying to throw up a smokescreen. They know the charges are false. </p> <p><b> Cheney</b> Senator, frankly, you have a record in the Senate that's not very distinguished ... you've missed a lot of key votes: on tax policy, on energy, on Medicare reform. </p> <p><b> Edwards</b> I'm surprised to hear him talk about records ... He voted against meals on wheels for seniors. He voted against a holiday for Martin Luther King. He voted against a resolution calling for the release of Nelson Mandela in South Africa.</p>",
  "<b>Daily Mail</b> <br>Editorial, October 5 <p>\"For those friends of Israel - and this paper counts itself one of them - the last few days have been extremely distressing. With the world's eyes turned on Iraq and the American elections, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has been engaged in a brutal attack on Gaza ... </p> <p>\"The scale of [Israel's] latest intervention is out of all proportion to the threat. Excessive use of military force will test the loyalty of Israel's many allies. More pertinently, it will convert a new generation of Palestinians to terrorism. Only the US, which has invested so much in the Iraq war, can deliver a solution. If it had devoted a tenth of this energy to building a Middle East peace, this crisis might not have come to such a tragic pass.\" </p> <p><b>Irish Times</b><br>Editorial, October 5 </p> <p>\"Israel's assault on northern Gaza ... is just as large-scale and destructive as previous operations there and on West Bank towns over the last year, but international reaction has been much more muted than before ... </p> <p>\"[That] is partly explained by the fact that the operation was provoked by the despicable killing of two young children in the Israeli town of Sderot in a rocket attack launched from Gaza and claimed by the Hamas resistance movement. But it is also because the more severe violence in Iraq has overshadowed this Israeli operation and because the US presidential election has diverted the attention of the principal internationa players with an interest in the conflict. As a result, Mr Sharon feels little constraint on his plan to deal a lethal military blow against Hamas prior to the proposed Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.\" </p> <p><b>Linda S Heard</b><br>Gulf News, United Arab Emirates, October 5 </p> <p>\"President George Bush's war on terror has been a veritable godsend for Israel's rightwing parties, providing an ostensible pretext for state-sponsored atrocities ...

As long as Israel labels the conflict as an internal matter it isn't going to happen. </p> <p>\"Iran's foreign ministry has accused Israel of committing genocide in Gaza. France's foreign minister has appealed to both Israel and the Palestinian Authority for an end to the violence. Egypt's foreign affairs minister has called for restraint and Tunisia has expressed its concern ... [But] as long as the UN, the EU, Russia and the Arab League spout punch-less platitudes and allow Israel and the US to remain a law unto themselves - to the shame of all of us - the cries, the blood and the tears of the people of Gaza will remain virtually ignored.\" </p> <p><b>Wall Street Journal Europe</b><br>Editorial, October 5 </p> <p>\"One of the things that sets this incursion apart from similar Israeli military campaigns in the past is Europe's rather muted reaction. While normally jumping on every opportunity to criticise the Jewish state for trying to protect its citizens, most European capitals have so far remained unusually silent ... </p> <p>\"Could it be that Europe is finally waking up to the reality in the Middle East? ... Without openly acknowledging it, most European leaders have followed Israel's and America's calls to isolate Mr Arafat ... </p> <p>\"Only a military solution can end the Palestinian terror. And thanks to improved intelligence, targeted assassinations and the security barrier, the Israelis are saying that it can be done. Palestinian suicide bombers now find it almost impossible to reach their targets. That's why Hamas has resorted to firing rockets ...

No matter how hot and humid it is, one would expect a parent to keep his children in the house under those circumstances. But not, apparently, a Palestinian parent ... </p> <p>\"So many Palestinian civilians deliberately chose to put themselves and their children into the line of fire. In our modern civilised world, it is apparently perfectly reasonable to sacrifice your children for the sake of generating anti-Israel propaganda.\" </p> <p><b>Danny Rubinstein</b><br>Haaretz, Israel, October 4 </p> <p>\"Palestinian commentators say the excessive force used by Israel in Gaza is first and foremost an indication of the weakness of Mr Sharon's government ... Such a thought encourages the attackers to continue until the Israeli withdrawal, and after it as well. </p> <p>\"All these things are true not only for Gaza, but also for the West Bank. Without an agreement and settlement in Gaza, it is almost certain that the rockets and mortar fire will reach the West Bank. They will be the Palestinian answer to the separation barrier, and they will overcome it even after the Israeli Defence Force makes the wall in Jerusalem three metres higher ... The talks with the Palestinians may be frustrating and annoying - but the truth is that there is no alternative.\"</p>",
  "The Iraq Survey Group announced today that 15 months of searching have uncovered no evidence that Saddam Hussein possessed significant weapons of mass destruction before the Iraq war. <p>The report contradicts claims made by Tony Blair and the US president George Bush before the war that Iraq possessed chemical and biological weapons.</p> <p>Presenting the evidence to the US senate, the group's leader Charles Duelfer said: \"It is my judgement that retained stocks do not exist. I still do not expect that militarily significant WMD stocks are hidden in Iraq.\"</p> <p>He added, however, that the ISG concluded Saddam had the desire and increasingly the capacity to develop WMD as sanctions weakened, and in 2003 was only months away from producing mustard gas.</p> <p>\"Evidence suggests that, as resources became available and the constraints of sanctions decayed there was a direct expansion of activity of supporting future WMD reconstitution\".</p> <p>Mr Duelfer said that he could not \"definitively\" say that WMDs were not transferred to other countries nor that stockpiles would not yet be found.</p> <p>But he said the ISG had made concerted efforts to ensure that Iraqi insurgents would not be able to obtain WMDs - though they had been trying to obtain them - and that it would continue its search for further evidence.</p> <p>Mr Blair, on a three-day visit to Africa, appealed for people to analyse the \"fullness\" of the report and to recognise that it showed sanctions were not working.</p> <p>\"Just as I have had to accept that the evidence now is there were no stockpiles of actual weapons ready to be deployed, I hope others have the honesty to accept that the report also shows that sanctions weren't working,\" he said.</p> <p>\"On the contrary, Saddam Hussein was doing his best to get round those sanctions, had every intention of redeveloping these programs and weapons of mass destruction.\" </p> <p>The Conservatives, however, said the report was further proof that Mr Blair had not told the truth about the war. </p> <p>The shadow defence secretary, Nicholas Soames, said: \"I don't think it alters the case for war one way or another personally, but I think it is difficult for the Americans and for the prime minister to explain.\"</p> <p>Speaking on the BBC, Mr Soames said: \"It does matter that the prime minister quite clearly was less than frank, is the politest way of possibly putting it.\" </p> <p>The Liberal Democrats, who have opposed the war from the outset, said that it was further proof that the government was wrong to take Britain to war.</p> <p>The party's foreign affairs spokesman, Sir Menzies Campbell, said: \"This report justifies the policy of containment and deterrence. </p> <p>\"It most certainly does not provide any support for the government's view that the threat from Saddam Hussein was so acute that only immediate military action would do. </p> <p>\"Brick by brick, the government's case for going to war is being demolished.\"</p> <p>The former foreign secretary, Robin Cook, who resigned from the government over the war, said the report destroyed the case for the invasion.</p> <p>\"It comprehensively establishes that Iraq had no stockpile, no biological agents, no chemical feedstocks, no plants to manufacture them and no delivery systems to fire them,\" he said. </p> <p>\"Saddam was no threat to us and had no weapons of mass destruction to pass to terrorists. Brushing the UN inspectors aside in order to go to war on false intelligence was a colossal blunder.\"</p> <p>The publication of the ISG report comes less than four weeks ahead of the US presidential election and less than a year before the next British general election.</p> <p>Neither the White House or Downing Street will relish its release, with critics likely to pounce on its conclusions in order to revive criticism of Mr Blair and Mr Bush's handling of the war.</p> <p>Mr Bush has argued that it stopped a long-term risk posed by Saddam and insisted during his campaign for re-election that Iraq had been a \"gathering\" threat.</p> <p>Mr Blair, speaking at the Labour conference last week, urged his party to put aside its differences over Iraq and focus on winning a third term in power.</p> <p>Mr Blair told the conference he accepted that the evidence about Saddam having \"actual biological and chemical weapons, as opposed to the capability to develop them, has turned out to be wrong\".</p> <p>\"I simply point out such evidence was agreed by the whole international community, not least because Saddam had used such weapons against his own people and neighbouring countries,\" he said.</p> <p>\"And the problem is I can apologise for the information that turned out to be wrong, but I can't, sincerely at least, apologise for removing Saddam. The world is a better place with Saddam in prison not in power.\"</p>",
  "Generally speaking, only Australians are interested in Australian elections - and not of all them, at that. More so when, as is the case now, the incumbent prime minister, John Howard, looks likely to edge a fourth consecutive term. <p>For the Northern Rivers Echo in Lismore, New South Wales, the big news this week was the location of a new sewage plant. This pungent controversy has left the efforts of the Labor leader, Mark Latham, to defeat the Liberal-National coalition government, led by Mr Howard, in the shade. </p> <p>Another top story concerned a forthcoming celebration of International Lesbian Day at the Italo Club. \"Local identity Nora Vidler-Blanksby will MC,\" the Echo reported. \"The night includes a smorgasbord meal and DJ.\" </p> <p>The Alice Springs News was more exercised about the problem of petrol sniffing than who would be top dog in Canberra after Saturday's election. A Yuendumu community project at the Mt Theo outstation \"has provided a healing environment for sniffers\", a correspondent wrote. </p> <p>This is not to say that election news is entirely absent from the local press. In an apparently blatant bid for votes, the government has reportedly promised Alice Springs its own international airport. According to the Geelong Advertiser, Labor has pledged more funding for regional day-care centres. </p> <p>The Hobart Mercury was fixated meanwhile on Mr Latham's vow to end logging in Tasmania's conservation forests, seen as a transparent pitch for the Green vote. </p> <p>With Australia's economy booming, and unemployment and interest rates low, the two main political parties are not that far apart on domestic issues - although that has not prevented the customary argy-bargy. </p> <p>The hard-hitting Mr Howard's message is fairly basic: \"Who do you trust to keep the economy strong and to protect family living standards?\" His leadership alone would keep Australia secure, he says. Mr Latham, who, aged 43, is 22 years younger than the prime minister, believes it is time for a change. His vow to \"ease the squeeze on middle Australia\" and promote social values has led Mr Howard to dub him a \"behavioural policeman\". </p> <p>It is on international issues that the voters' options become more clear-cut, but even then, there is considerable policy overlap. </p> <p>Tapping into the deep unpopularity of the Iraq war, Mr Latham promised earlier this year to withdraw Australia's troops from the country by Christmas. But this Spanish-style pledge has now been watered down, with some forces likely to remain indefinitely. </p> <p>Echoing the British debate, Mr Latham accuses the prime minister, who in 1999 appointed himself America's regional \"deputy sheriff\", of being too eager to please the US president, George Bush, of undermining national security and misleading the country over Iraq. </p> <p>In a winning performance in a televised debate with Mr Howard, Mr Latham alluded to the terrorism in Bali, in 2002, which ended with 88 Australians killed, and to last month's bombing of Australia's embassy in Jakarta. Mr Howard's unquestioning support for the \"war on terror\" had rendered the country \"less safe\", he claimed. </p> <p>Labor says it wants a more regional approach to foreign and anti-terrorism policies and more emphasis on the UN and upholding international law. Funding would be provided, for example, to train Indonesia's police in counter-terrorism. </p> <p>But for all that, Mr Latham proposes no fundamental change in Australia's key US alliance or the Anzus mutual defence pact. And it was Mr Howard, after all, who long ago recognised the strategic and economic importance of building good relations with China, Asia's biggest player and biggest potential threat. Last year he gave the Chinese leader, Hu Jintao, the honour of addressing parliament. </p> <p>This lack of clear alternatives may help Mr Howard keep his job. It also helps explain the local papers' preferred focus on stories like that of Brent Hall from Meerschaum Vale - who invented a macadamia nut harvester. In all innocence, he calls it the \"Bush Rat\".</p>",

  "Welcome to the Backbencher, Guardian Unlimited's weekly insider's guide to Westminster. <p> <b> &gt;&gt;&gt; FROM BOURNEMOUTH</b></p> <p>The Backbencher caught up with the Guardian's political correspondent Nicholas Watt and asked him about the mood among the Tory faithful.</p> <p>\"The sun has come out and it's pretty warm in Bournemouth today, and that matches the mood of a lot of the Conservatives here. They know that they're in a pretty desperate position in the polls, but they were all encouraged by Michael Howard's speech. It was brought forward - normally the Tory leader speaks on Thursday, but he spoke on Tuesday, to try and define the week. There was a definite feeling that he had a difficult job. He couldn't do a tub-thumping speech, appealing to the party in an emotional way, because the feeling is that that's what Tony Blair has done for the last few years and people are turned off by it. So it had to be low-key, but being low-key means that people might say 'so what? What are you saying?' The feeling is that Mr Howard got the balance right, and MPs on all sides of the party - including many who have spent the last 10 years criticising and backbiting about Tory leaders - were quite encouraged.</p> <p>\"So there's a good mood here, but it's a realistic mood. They are not saying, privately anyway, that they are about to storm down Downing Street. It's 31 weeks today until the expected general election on May 5, and on that day they should all be taking their cabinet posts with their 'timetable for action'. But I was speaking to one senior shadow minister today and he laughed at the prospect that he would be joining the cabinet. 'There will be no Conservative cabinet in seven months' time,' he said.</p> <p>\"Today is much more of a policy-intensive day. If yesterday was about broad themes, today was policy-heavy. We had David Willetts talking about pensions this morning, and the key speech of the day was by David Davis. And it was really a very tough speech, especially compared with those of recent years when the emollient Oliver Letwin had the job of shadow home secretary - a much more liberal one than David Blunkett, too. </p> <p>\"None of that today from Mr Davis. He was very tough on immigration, and came out with a sentence that might well be picked up: he talked about how a Conservative government would substantially cut immigration into Britain, and then he said 'uncontrolled immigration endangers the values which we in Britain rightly treasure'. Critics may well say that he is straying into the highly sensitive territory that Margaret Thatcher famously trod in the 1979 general election when she talked of Britain being 'swamped' by immigrants. But the Tories believe immigration is an absolutely key area, and they think that if they could define themselves on that in a general election, they could scoop up the Tory voters who have been abandoning the party in recent years.</p> <p>\"They also believe that law and order is going to be another defining issue in the general election, and Mr Davis gave a tough message on crime. He said 'criminals should be afraid', and accused Labour of being soft on it. He used a very emotive video to show that - a pensioner giving a tragic account of how his wife was murdered in front of him by a criminal in their house. But that could happen under any government, and it could be seen as a slightly cheap way of using somebody's tragic circumstances.\"</p> <p><b>&gt;&gt;&gt; LAST WEEK'S COMPETITION</b></p> <p>Congratulations to James Donally, who - unlike many entrants - was able to recall the slogan of last week's Labour party conference, A Better Life for All. \"I think you have to let me win as I must be the only Backbencher subscriber living in Turkmenistan, whose President for Life is not short of a catchy slogan himself.

Backbencher readers will recall that after the grilling a sympathetic Mr Brunson asked the ex-PM about the more troublesome elements in his party - the \"b*****ds\", of whom Silky was one.</p> <p><b>&gt;&gt;&gt; NO TRUCK WITH THE EU</b></p> <p>It was bad enough submitting to the interrogation of the European parliament in Brussels this week. Much worse, however, was the headline in Tuesday's Le Monde: \"Peter Mandelson sera l'un des 'poids lourds' de l'equipe Barroso\" - which, roughly translated, means that Mandy will be the HGV of the new European commission. Heavyweight is one thing, but being compared to a lorry is another. Or could the paper have been alluding to one of Tim Yeo's pledges this week? \"I'll scrap Labour's planned Lorry Road User Charge and instead help British hauliers compete on level terms with continental trucks.\"</p> <p><b>&gt;&gt;&gt; CHARM OFFENSIVE (PART 1)</b></p> <p>The Backbencher is far too discreet to reveal the surname of the Tory MP who told a friend in the coffee queue that \"the age of the totty here is much better than five years ago\". It would rasher still to hint at his surname. She merely hopes Mr X will be cured by the time he returns next year.

But despite a growing reputation for unpunctuality, the MP has found time to post a few yelps from the fringe on his new weblog. \"Michael Howard is soaring like an eagle,\" the multi-tasker confides to his fans. (Not, absolutely not, like a bat.) \"Vicki Woods spoke in favour of recapturing the old vote - as well as recapturing the young.

  "National polls conducted since the televised Bush-Kerry debate on September 30 showed a surge in support for the Democratic challenger, and this seems to have been reflected in surveys of the all-important swing states. <p>A <a href=\"http://www.surveyusa.com/2004_Elections/OH041005xpreswsenv.pdf\">SurveyUSA poll</a> in Ohio yesterday - just hours ahead of the locally-filmed vice-presidential debate - found that John Kerry had bounced back from a four-point deficit. The poll said 49% of voters supported him, against 48% for George Bush. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the overall picture provided by pollster <a href=\"http://www.cookpolitical.com/races/report_pdfs/2004_electoral_college_oct4.pdf\">Charlie Cook</a> also showed a slight shift in Kerry's favour in the swing states.</p> <p>Cook sees Bush's total number of electoral votes - 270 are needed to win the electoral college - dropping slightly from 211 in September to 208 on October 3. Kerry's share has stayed the same - 207 - and with 123 electoral votes in 11 swing states up for grabs, the race appears to be wide open.</p> <p>The latest survey by <a href=\"http://www.zogby.com/news/ReadNews.dbm?ID=868\">John Zogby</a>, conducted on September 21, found that neither of the main candidates \"holds a clear-cut lead in enough states to win the electoral college votes required to capture the White House\".</p> <p>According to Zogby's monthly surveys, Bush has been trailing Kerry since July but has begun to close the gap. He now holds 241 electoral votes compared to Kerry's 264.</p> <p>This was all in stark contrast to a poll published in the <a href=\"http://www.philly.com/mld/philly/news/special_packages/election2004/polls/\"> Philadelphia Inquirer</a> 12 days before the presidential debate, which showed that Bush had opened up significant leads in 11 of the13 states that were most closely fought at the last election, including Ohio.</p> <p>According to the survey, compiled by Mason-Dixon, the president was leading in six of the swing states won by the Republicans at the last election and five of the seven Democrat-held swing states.</p> <p><b>Update on the situation in the swing-states</b></p> <p>Depending on which pollster you listen to, there are as many as 20 or as few as three battleground states. The candidates are particularly active in Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania, because these states have the most electoral votes to offer among the undecided bloc.</p> <p>The number of electoral votes a state receives is based on its population, making California the largest with 55 electoral votes. Seven states, and the District of Columbia, qualify for the minimum of three.</p> <p>The following twenty states have the closest races (electoral votes in parentheses):</p> <p>Bush won Arizona (10) fairly decisively in 2000, and an early-September poll by Market Solutions Group showed him to have what may be an unassailable lead: 54% to Kerry's 38%.</p> <p>Cook lists Arkansas (6) as a \"likely\" Bush win, but Zogby says it the state is \"too close to call\". The Kerry campaign has targeted Arkansas for its pre-election advertising spend.</p> <p>Colorado (9) voted for Bush in 2000 and leans towards him now, but Kerry has targeted the state for an advertising blitz during the final weeks of the campaign. Cook lists the state as a \"toss up\", but Zogby says the state has swung from Kerry to Bush over the last month.</p> <p>The biggest prize among the undecided states is Florida (27), which chose Bush in 2000 - with a little help from the supreme court - by the razor-thin margin of 527 votes.</p> <p>Iowa (7) went to Gore in 2000. By August 26, Gallup still had Kerry leading Bush by 51% to 45%. But last month, Mason-Dixon said Bush was in front with 48% against Kerry's 42%.</p> <p>Cook says Michigan (17) leans toward Kerry, and Gore won here last time. Mason-Dixon shows Kerry on a six point lead.</p> <p>Even with independent Ralph Nader taking 5% of the vote in 2000, Gore still won Minnesota (10). However, Bush could win here - polls show that neither he nor Kerry has a real lead.</p> <p>A Zogby poll from August 25 showed Missouri (11) and Nevada (5) being too close to call, but he now says they have both moved into the Bush camp. Cook also lists them as a probable Bush win.</p> <p>Bush just squeaked ahead in New Hampshire (4) at the last election, although the state may feel well disposed to a fellow New Englander in Kerry. For now, it remains too close to call.</p> <p>Gore won New Mexico (5) by a small margin in 2000, and the race for the state is still very close. Mason-Dixon's September poll has Bush and Kerry tied on 48%.</p> <p>North Carolina (15) leans toward Bush - but this is John Edwards' home state, and the Kerry campaign intends to spend heavily to turn things around.</p> <p>A Gallup poll taken in mid-August confirmed that Ohio (20) will be a key battleground state. The recent SurveyUSA poll (see above) gives Kerry a narrow lead.</p> <p>In 2000, Gore won Oregon (7) by a whisker, with 46.9% of the vote to Bush's 46.5%. Nader took a hefty 5%. Cook and Mason-Dixon say the state is leaning towards Kerry.</p> <p>Pennsylvania (21) went to Gore in 2000, but only just. The August 26 Gallup poll had Bush and Kerry neck and neck on 47%, with Nader at 2%, and 4% undecided.</p> <p>Cook says Tennessee (11) has gone from \"likely Bush\" to \"solid Bush in the last month, but Zogby feels it could still go either way. The Kerry campaign doesn't seem to be holding out much hope - it's not one of the 20 states where they have bought ad time.</p> <p>Bush will win Virginia (13), Cook believes, and Kerry has not pre-bought ad time in the state.</p> <p>Washington (11) will probably go to Kerry, says Cook, and the Republicans haven't won a presidential vote here since Ronald Reagan did so in 1984. Bush has been targeting the state, but Kerry has not been complacent, allocating money for late-campaign advertising.</p> <p>Democrats outnumber Republicans by two to one in West Virginia (5), but Bush took the state in 2000. Both Bush and Kerry campaigned here over the Labour Day holiday weekend, with polls showing the candidates running neck and neck.</p> <p>Wisconsin (10) went to Gore in 2000, but the September Mason-Dixon poll put Bush slightly ahead at 48%, with 46% preferring Kerry.</p>",
  "The Conservatives today called for greater military commitment to Africa, with British forces implementing a no fly zone in the Darfur region of Sudan and, if necessary, backing UN monitors in Zimbabwe. <p>With publication of the Iraq Survey Group (ISG) report due tonight, the shadow foreign secretary, Michael Ancram, attacked the Tony Blair over a failure to plan for the peace in post-Saddam Iraq and for leading Britain into a \"dangerous half-war\", but he stepped back from accusing him of lying.</p> <p>Mr Ancram instead laid the blame for \"a successful war becoming a shaky and danger-filled peace\" at Mr Blair's door.</p> <p>Speaking during the foreign affairs debate at the party conference in Bournemouth, Mr Ancram said one of the first actions of a Tory government would be to get a UN security council resolution to send monitors and observers into Zimbabwe.</p> <p>If this was unacceptable to Robert Mugabe, the Zimbabwean president, enforcement by British troops could not be ruled out, his press aides confirmed.</p> <p>Earlier Alan Duncan, the new shadow international development secretary, criticised Mr Blair's current trip to Africa, accusing him of posing in \"stunts and photo-ops [that] don't feed the world's poor\".</p> <p>He called for an increase in the African Union force in the Sudan, with a pledge to provide logistical support and even policing a no-fly zone.</p> <p>Mr Duncan said: \"His trip to Africa lets him pose, but if he won't call the horror in Darfur in Sudan by its right name - genocide - how can we expect effective action that will save lives?\"</p> <p>Mr Ancram's attack over Iraq was relatively restrained, not mentioning the ISG or calling on Mr Blair to resign or dubbing him a liar. Tory pollsters have claimed during the Bournemouth conference that Iraq is only 12th on a list of voters' concerns.</p> <p>But Mr Ancram did say the prime minister had \"misled\" the British people and lost their trust, before attacking him for \"ingratiating\" himself with French and German leaders.</p> <p>He joked: \"One day poodle Blair. Next day dachshund Blair. But bulldog Blair - never.\" He accused Mr Blair of \"surrender\" over the EU constitution, the charter of fundamental rights and a European army.</p> <p>And he called the EU constitution a \"gateway too far\" vowing that the Tories would be able to renegotiate it from a position of strength.</p> <p>He told delegates: \"The no vote for which we will campaign will stop the constitution in its tracks. It will force European leaders back to the drawing board at a time when we will lead the European agenda.\"</p> <p>Mr Ancram declared that, according to the \"timetable for action\" template which has governed the Tories' conference, within a week of winning the election: \"I will formally repudiate the dishonourable agreement reached with Spain by this government to share sovereignty over Gibraltar.\"</p> <p>And, in a moment of pure rabble-rousing, he told Romano Prodi to \"get lost\" over his alleged suggestion that future Olympics could see Britons compete under the European flag.</p> <p>He was more vague on the other members of US president George Bush's \"axis of evil\", saying merely: \"North Korea and Iran, in their different ways, must give grave cause for concern. While our response must always be firm, it should be tempered with dialogue where we can.\" </p> <p><b>Relations with the US</b></p> <p>On the key relationship between Britain and the US, Mr Ancram said: \"I want a strengthened and honest relationship with America based on shared values and beliefs and mutual respect. A relationship as before where we speak frankly to each other as friends and work together as partners.\" </p> <p>Mr Duncan, the new international development secretary, who took over in Mr Howard's September reshuffle, promised that a renegotiation with the EU would mean that more British aid money was directed by London rather than Brussels, and that within a week of taking power he would \"put a paper to cabinet on setting up a permanently structured relief capability\".</p> <p>Earlier, the shadow defence secretary, Nicholas Soames, promised to increase defence spending by \u00a32.7bn over three years, funded by Whitehall savings, in order to retain regional infantry regiments and keep three frigates destined for the axe by Labour.</p> <p>Mr Soames told delegates: \"For months its been Labour's big lie that we will cut defence. After his [shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin's] announcement, that lie can never be pedalled again.\"</p>",
  "<p>An important (some say the most important) presidential election is imminent in the US, and what promises to be an interesting general election is just over the horizon in the UK. </p> <p>What part, if any, will undergraduates play in these great affairs of state? The auguries, in America at least, are not good. The proportion of students eligible to vote for their president who actually do vote for their president is wretched. It stands at around 36%. They really don't care if it's President Chalk or President Cheese who becomes their commander in chief. </p> <p>With a view to prodding the student electorate out of its traditional apathy, an amendment was added to the 1998 Higher Education Act obliging institutions to supply voter registration forms and to urge students to exercise their constitutional rights. One of those rights is the choice of voting either home or away - where you were brought up or where you are currently enrolled. </p> <p>According to a survey in last month's Chronicle of Higher Education, institutional compliance with the 1998 act has been lamentable. A third of American universities have not done what the law requires. They really don't care. </p> <p>Even where the university does care, students can face an assault course on the way to the polling booth. Local election officials tend not to like these fly-by-night voters. Those with long memories can recall what happened in the city of Ann Arbor, in the early 1970s. Having been permitted to vote in local elections, students joyously decriminalised marijuana. For a few glorious years, until the moral majority reasserted itself, the maximum penalty for possession around the University of Michigan was a $5 fine. </p> <p>Today's students, even though they tend to be more responsible than the UM potheads, will quite likely be confronted with deterringly complex qualification forms (a technique used in the South for generations to disenfranchise black voters). Officials sometimes object to a dormitory address being a home. In some districts students are required to validate residence by matching the address on their driving licence with that of their university (invariably different). Even if they pass that test, hopeful voters may have to demonstrate an \"intention to remain\" in the university or its environs after their course of study. </p> <p>A counter-attack has been mounted by partisan organisations with a special interest in mobilising young voters (young Democratic voters, principally). Rock the Vote has dispatched its euphonious buses to the big campuses. On its <a href=\"http://www.rockthevote.org\" target_new\">website</a> it offers an online voter registration tool for students (free of charge). Rock the Vote explodes such \"myths\" as \"you might lose your financial aid if you change where you are registered to vote\". Thanks to Rock the Vote, John Kerry, like Bill Clinton before him, has locked in the MTV watchers. </p> <p>Given the huge congregations of undergraduates in many American universities, and given Coleridge's law that man is born liberal and dies conservative, a mass turn-out by students could be critical in 2004. Even more so since there are defining policy differences between the candidates. George Bush has primarily directed his attention to school reform, leaving higher education to look after itself. His theological antagonism to stem cell research and his conviction that \"the jury is still out on evolution\" alienates the university scientific community. His affected disdain for books and big words alienates the humanists. Among male undergraduates, President Bush's increasingly bloody and unpopular war has raised fears of a draft after November's dust subsides. </p> <p>Mr Kerry, by contrast, holds out the biggest package of university reforms since President Clinton. He promises to enlarge the Pell grant scheme (financial aid for disadvantaged students). He promises tax credits to relieve the \"middle-class squeeze\" on parents, faced with ballooning tuition fees. By promising a boost to the \"Americorps\" programme (the revamped Peace Corps) Mr Kerry has identified himself as a peacenik, not a warmonger. Students like that. They may even switch off their MTV and vote for it. </p> <p>The British politician who has most shrewdly assessed the value of the student vote is Ken Livingstone. In the June 2004 elections, unlike the other mayoral candidates, he went out of his way to court the capital's undergraduates.</p> <p>In an \"exclusive interview\" with the London Student newspaper, when asked what he had done for its readers to earn their support, Mr Livingstone replied (with dubious arithmetic, but an irresistible appeal to the pocket): \"Two hundred thousand extra students are getting cheaper fares - that matters. Just my [sic] cutting fares for students can put three or four quid in someone's pocket for the week and that can make the difference between being hungry or not.\"</p> <p>Although he himself had never been to university Mr Livingstone was, he protested, a (rebel) student at heart: \"In 1969 - after all the great demonstrations and upheavals of '68 - I came to the conclusion that you would not change the world from the streets. You actually needed to do what Daniel Cohn-Bendit - Danny the Red - called 'The long march through the institutions' - and here I am 35 years later.\"</p> <p>Although he no longer marches through them, the streets around the University of London are easier to walk around nowadays. Since Mr Livingstone was elected, the whole Bloomsbury precinct has been handsomely pedestrianised. The initiative to civilise the student quarter originated, one suspects, in the mayoral parlour. Students like Ken because (as they perceive) he likes them. Even when not electioneering, he writes a regular column for the London Student. The analysis has not been done, but I suspect it was London students who swung the last, closely-contested, mayoral election his way. </p> <p>If, as the Labour party grandly promises, the student body swells to the talismanic 50% of school leavers, their votes, concentrated in city-sized campuses, will be a significant force in future British elections - assuming, of course, that like their American counterparts, British students will be able to cast their vote where they study. With this demographic in mind, there is a backward-looking reform that the government should consider. From the early 17th century, Oxford and Cambridge had their own members of parliament - voted in by members of the university. In 1867, the University of London got its MP, and in 1918 the big redbrick universities theirs. </p> <p>En masse, the university members formed an articulate, if somewhat narrow-minded, lobby. They were abolished in 1950, with all the other special interest members. Given the increasing university population over the next decades it would surely make sense to revive this ancient institution. Who knows, it might get out the student vote. And even, perhaps, shut the noisy buggers up a bit.</p>",

  "The race for the White House turned aggressively personal last night in a vice-presidential debate that saw some of the campaign's sharpest exchanges so far as the candidates addressed Saddam Hussein's alleged links to terrorism. <p>Fighting to win back ground lost to the Democrats following last Thursday's head-to-head between George Bush and John Kerry, vice-president Dick Cheney refused to back down from his highly controversial position that Saddam and al-Qaida had extensive connections. The Iraq war had been \"exactly the right thing to do\", he insisted, because of an \"established Iraqi track record with terror\".</p> <p>Mr Cheney's rival, John Edwards, immediately established a confrontational atmosphere that rarely let up, accusing his opponent of \"not being straight with the American people\".</p> <p>Addressing Mr Cheney directly, rather than through the moderator, the North Carolina senator said: \"Mr vice-president, there is no connection between the attacks of September 11 and Saddam Hussein. The 9/11 Commission has said it. Your own secretary of state has said it. And you've gone around the country suggesting that there is some connection. There is not.\"</p> <p>The 90-minute debate, in the crucial swing state of Ohio, saw personal barbs traded on everything from Mr Edwards' former career as a trial lawyer to the Bush administration's relationship with Halliburton, Mr Cheney's former employer. </p> <p>One instant-response poll among viewers judged Mr Edwards's performance somewhat superior - but there was relief among Republican campaign operatives that their team would probably not be going two-nil down into this Friday's second meeting between Mr Bush and Mr Kerry. Last night's debate had assumed an importance unusual for vice-presidential confrontations after Mr Bush scowled and frowned through Mr Kerry's answers last week.</p> <p>Discussing Iraq yesterday, the vice-president insisted that he had never sought to link Saddam Hussein specifically to the September 11 attacks. But Iraq had been \"the most likely nexus between the terrorists and weapons of mass destruction\", he said. He deflected a question about this week's statement by Paul Bremer, the former head of the coalition provisional authority, that there had been too few ground troops deployed in the invasion. The aggressive pursuit of Osama bin Laden continued, he maintained.</p> <p>Mr Edwards used the issue of the war to pre-emptively address the criticism that, as a one-term senator, he lacked the political experience to become vice-president. \"A long resume does not equal good judgment,\" he said. As the debate turned to economic issues, he added: \"Vice-president, I don't think the country can take four more years of this kind of experience.\" </p> <p>The two candidates performed true to their highly contrasting characters. Mr Cheney was downbeat and occasionally contemptuous of his opponent, declining to address at all many criticisms involving Halliburton's no-bid contracts in Iraq. Instead he simply pointed the audience to a website - although, embarrassingly, the address he gave - <a href=\"http://factcheck.com\">factcheck.com</a> - was incorrect, and linked to an anti-Bush site run by the philanthropist George Soros, rather than to the site he meant to promote, <a href=\"http://factcheck.org\">factcheck.org</a>.</p> <p>Mr Edwards' boyish smile, meanwhile, was regularly in evidence, and he finished his performance with a homespun vision of \"the bright light of America\", which he said was currently \"flickering\". But in his detailed criticisms on Iraq he made significant efforts to combat the view that he is a foreign-policy lightweight.</p> <p>In one particularly ill-tempered exchange, Mr Cheney, who presides over the senate, said Mr Edwards's attendance record there was so poor that the debate was the first time they had met. (In fact, the two had met at least twice previously.) Mr Edwards countered by recalling the vice-president's votes against the release of Nelson Mandela and against a holiday in honour of Martin Luther King. </p> <p>The very format of the debate was a victory for the Bush camp: the two men sat at a semicircular table, with the public television anchor Gwen Ifill facing them in the middle. Mr Cheney, the former chief executive, seemed profoundly at home, while the arrangement prevented Mr Edwards, the former trial lawyer, from striding the stage.</p> <p>But the frenetic post-debate spinning by senior campaign advisors in a gym adjoining the debate hall offered one key indicator that the debate really had been a draw: each side claimed that their man had won. In Florida last Thursday, by contrast, many Bush spokespeople tried the damage-limitation tactic of portraying the match as a draw. </p> <p>\"Did Cheney exceed the president's low bar? Yeah, of course he did,\" said Terry McAuliffe, chairman of the Democratic National Committee. \"But the vice-president was contradicting himself and afraid to admit something he's said publicly, over and over again: that Saddam Hussein had a role and was behind 9/11. The vice-president could have come out tonight and said sometimes we make mistakes, sometimes intelligence is faulty.\"</p> <p>But Ken Mehlman, Mr Bush's campaign manager, told the Guardian the vice-president had made clear the fundamental philosophical differences between the two tickets. \"He was saying in a world where 19 people with boxcutters can kill 3,000 Americans in the course of 20 minutes, allowing to remain in power a brutal dictator who defied the world, who had a weapons of mass destruction capability... wasn't acceptable and wasn't safe.</p> <p>\"The Kerry-Edwards worldview says only deal with the immediate risk. Our strategy says in a post-9/11 world, you've got to deal not only with the immediate risk, but risks before they materialise.\"</p>",
  "Welcome to the Wrap, Guardian Unlimited's round-up of the best of the day's papers. <p>Also in today's Wrap: US election race hots up; politics, Afghan-style; Wales disappears. </p> <p><b>HOWARD MAKES A SPLASH</b></p> <p>Whatever else may be said about Michael Howard's keynote speech to the Tory conference yesterday, its achievement in wringing a straightforward front page news story out of the Independent should not be sneered at. The report says Mr Howard \"made clear he would fight the general election on a rightwing agenda\" and \"hardened his rhetoric on Europe as he sought to stem a haemorrhage of support to the UK Independence Party\". He promised that on their first day in power (insert your own jibe here), the Tories would set an early date for a referendum on the proposed EU constitution, and that they would wrest back control of employment policy and fisheries.</p> <p>Over at the Guardian, too, Mr Howard may find comfort. Simon Hoggart writes warmly of \"the most effective part of the speech ... when he spoke movingly and personally about how his mother-in-law died of a hospital superbug, and his grandmother was killed in one of Hitler's concentration camps\". Hoggart also gets in a dig at Mr Howard's vowels, but then that's a sketch writer's job.</p> <p>The Times, too is impressed. Its leader praises the speech, noting that though it emphasised action over words, it was deftly worded. It says that, whatever the state of the rest of the Tory party, Mr Howard is the clear and rightful leader of it.</p> <p>Mr Howard will get the biggest boost, though, from the Telegraph, which awards him a front page photo, a full rundown of key points on an inside page and a glowing leader: \"Michael Howard plays a blinder by the seaside.\" The leader column is full of tides turning for the Tories, cultural shifts and \"conservatism coming back into vogue\". We'll see.</p> <p>And the bad news? The Telegraph's sketch writer disloyally finds him \"courageously, magnificently dull\". The Independent, having been so commendably fair and balanced on the news pages, gets stuck in for pretty much the whole comment section. It was \"the speech of a leader whose party is on the back foot\", says the leader column. The problem, says Johann Hari, is \"not the singer but the song\"; Michael Howard is all very well, but the Tories need new ideas. Michael Brown says \"one good speech, one autumn morning\" does not alter his conviction that the Tory party is dying.</p> <p>The most damning responses come from the Guardian, though one suspects Mr Howard will not be losing too much sleep about losing voters from the Tory party's Guardian-reading constituency. Polly Toynbee says the man who towered over the Tory conference was not Michael Howard, but Tony Blair, who is now a political colossus of the stature of Margaret Thatcher. The Guardian leader darkly mutters that Mr Howard \"seems to have struck a dirty deal with John Redwood [a noted Eurosceptic] to persuade the businessman Paul Sykes to stop bankrolling Ukip. From a man who says he wants to give it to us straight, this seems very much like the old politics as usual.\"</p> <p>*<a href=\"http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/politics/story.jsp?story=569234\">Independent: Howard: Back to basics</a><br> *<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2004/10/06/dl0601.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2004/10/06/ixnewstop.html\">Telegraph: Michael Howard plays a blinder by the seaside</a><br> *<a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/conservatives2004/comment/0,15018,1320440,00.html\">Mining Europhobia</a><br></p> <p> <b>SOMEONE HAD BLUNDERED</b></p> <p>Meanwhile, the election campaign in America was heating up with last night's televised vice-presidential debate between the incumbent Dick Cheney, and the would-be John Edwards.

  "Many around the world are surprised at how little attention the economy is receiving in President Bush's re-election campaign. But I am not surprised: if I were Bush, the last thing I would want to talk about is the economy. Yet many people look at America's economy, even over these past three-and-a-half years, with some envy. Annual economic growth - at an average rate of 2.5% - may have been markedly slower than during the Clinton years, but it still looks strong compared with Europe's anaemic 1%. <p>But these statistics mask a glaring fact: the average American family is worse off than it was three-and-a-half years ago. Median income has fallen by over $1,500 in real terms, with families being squeezed as wages lag behind inflation. In short, all that growth benefited only those at the top of the income distribution, the same group that had done so well over the previous 30 years and benefited most from Bush's tax cut. </p> <p>For example, some 45 million Americans have no health insurance, up by 5.2 million from 2000. Families lucky enough to have health insurance face annual premiums that have nearly doubled, to $7,500. Families also face increasing job insecurity. This is the first time since the early 1930s that there has been a net loss of jobs over the span of a presidential administration. </p> <p>Bush supporters ask: is Bush really to blame for this? Wasn't the recession already beginning when he took office? </p> <p>The resounding answer is that Bush is to blame. Every president inherits a legacy. The economy was entering a downturn when Bush took office, but Clinton also left a huge budget surplus - 2% of GDP - a pot of money with which to finance a robust recovery. But Bush squandered that surplus, converting it into a deficit of 5% of GDP through tax cuts for the rich. </p> <p>The productivity growth that was sustained through the downturn presented an opportunity and a challenge. The opportunity: if the economy was well managed, the incomes of Americans could continue to rise as they had done in the 1990s. The challenge: to manage the economy so that growth would be robust enough to create the new jobs required by new entrants to the labour force. Bush failed the challenge, and America lost the opportunity. </p> <p>True, the economy was stimulated a little by the tax cuts. But there were other policies that would have provided far more stimulus at far less cost. Bush's objective was to push forward a tax agenda that shifted the burden away from those who could best afford to bear it. </p> <p>Bush's failed policies have cost the economy dearly, and have left it in a far weaker position going forward. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office agrees that the deficit will not be eliminated in the foreseeable future - or even cut in half, as Bush has promised. Expenditures on which America's future economic health depends - infrastructure, education, health and technology - will be crowded out. </p> <p>Because fiscal policy did not stimulate the economy, a greater burden was placed on monetary policy. Lower interest rates worked (a little), but for the most part by encouraging households to refinance their mortgages, not by stimulating investment. The increased indebtedness of households is already leading to higher bankruptcy rates, and will likely dampen the recovery. </p> <p>National debt too has risen sharply. The huge trade deficit provides the spectacle of the world's richest country borrowing almost $2bn a day from abroad, contributing to the weak dollar and representing a major source of global uncertainty. </p> <p>There might be some hope for the future if Bush owned up to his mistakes and changed course. But no: he refuses to take responsibility for the economy, just as his administration fails to take responsibility for its failures in Iraq. In 2003, having seen that its tax cuts for the rich had failed to stimulate the economy, the administration refused to revise its strategies. </p> <p>In August, I joined nine other American Nobel prize winners in economics in signing an open letter to the public. We wrote: \"President Bush and his administration have embarked on a reckless and extreme course that endangers the long-term economic health of our nation ... The differences between President Bush and John Kerry with respect to leadership on the economy are wider than in any other presidential election in our experience. President Bush believes that tax cuts benefiting the most wealthy Americans are the answer to almost every economic problem.\" </p> <p>Here, as elsewhere, Bush is dead wrong, and too dogmatic to admit it. </p> <p>Joseph Stiglitz is professor of economics at Columbia University and a Nobel prize winner </p> <p>\u00a9 Project Syndicate </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.project-syndicate.org\">www.project-syndicate.org</a></p>",

  "In this political season, where men on both sides of the Atlantic are frantically offering themselves up for public approval - a beauty contest for unlovely people - it seems right to ask: what makes a good politician? It's not a simple business. John Kerry was declared the winner of last week's TV debate not only because of his concisely expressed criticisms of the invasion of Iraq, but also because of his demeanour. He displayed that elusive, indefinable quality: he looked presidential. The timbre of his voice, his posture and bearing, gave him an aura of steady authority. George Bush, by contrast, looked tetchy - and that was when he wasn't smirking. Still, Bush has other strengths to draw on. He is so determined, so ruthless a fighter that there is almost no trick he won't pull between now and November 2 to get elected. He's proved that before - in the 2000 primaries against John McCain, the Florida stand-off that year, and the mid-term elections of 2002. The methods might have been foul - full of dishonesty, cynicism and hypocrisy - but they worked. Bush won. <p>The trouble with both these qualities - an aura of gravitas or a talent for political blood sport - is that, while either might bring you electoral success, neither ensures skill in the area that politics should be about: governing. For proof, look no further than our own country. In the brute business of politics - winning and keeping power - Tony Blair is a truly world-class performer. As a speechmaker, he gets better and better. You only had to watch Michael Howard in Bournemouth yesterday to realise how good Blair was in Brighton a week ago. He combines light and shade, switching effortlessly from soft-spoken and sincere to loud and declamatory. He seduces an audience, as if in private conversation. </p> <p>But he is not accomplished in the performance art of politics alone. His move last Thursday night - the dramatic triple announcement of cardiac surgery, a house move and a determination to stay in the job for one more term - won plaudits as a stunning piece of political footwork. He had turned a moment of vulnerability into an act of aggression, asserting his own primacy. Any circling sharks were told to withdraw their fangs for a few years at least. It's not just the little moves that Blair gets right. He's done pretty well on the big ones too. The depth of the Tories' plight, so vividly on show in Bournemouth, is very much Blair's achievement. By colonising the centre ground and beyond, he has left them homeless. </p> <p>All this is evidence of Blair's mastery of politics. The trouble is, that's not the same as an ability to govern. There, a different picture emerges. After seven and a half years in power, even Blair's admirers talk of his almost desperate search for a legacy. They concede that the large domestic achievements of this administration are associated with the Treasury rather than with him, and that little bearing the Blair stamp will endure long after he has gone. Even the big constitutional changes - devolution to Scotland and Wales - are attributed more to his predecessor than to him. </p> <p>The problems he defined in opposition have persisted, or at least that is the impression he gives. His constant talk of reform of the public services implies that the public services are broken and need fixing. Judged by his own rhetoric, he has failed the big domestic tests he set for himself. Those decisions with which Blair is intimately associated tend to be unhappy ones. In the innocent days of the 2001 election, it was the Dome that he could not quite shake off. Next time it will be the much graver matter of Iraq. </p> <p>Put simply, Blair may one day be viewed as a first-class politician whose record in government was not in the same league. The contrasting figure is Gordon Brown. His record in government is gargantuan: a stable, record-breaking economy; a minimum wage; action on child poverty; a move to full employment; unprecedented investment in public services, blessed by the public; and a war on global debt. Yet his record in politics does not look quite so accomplished. Of course, it's a major achievement to have stayed in the exchequer as long as he has - most have failed to hold on - and to have retained the electorate's support throughout. Labour's private polling has Brown's trust-rating around plus-65, while Blair's languishes around minus-20. But in the cruel game of politics, there is only one measure that counts - and that is winning the big prize. </p> <p>On this test, Brown has shown none of the ruthless skill of his neighbour. In November 2003, Blair promised he would stand down a year later in Brown's favour - so long as Brown helped him through the period ahead, allowing Blair to make a graceful exit. He had to get through Hutton and Iraqi reconstruction, and wanted a couple of domestic achievements. Brown duly cooperated - pulling the plug on a backbench tuition fees revolt which might have proved terminal to Blair, offering a public defence of the Iraq policy and even shelving his own misgivings on foundation hospitals and the like. </p> <p>Blair pocketed all that help, got through the year - and then promptly announced the deal was off. As an act of political betrayal, it has few rivals. (And now the Blairites have the chutzpah to say it was Brown who reneged on the deal - a deal which, they hastily add, did not exist!) Express dismay at this treachery and Blair's defenders will only redouble their admiration. As one put it to me: \"That's showbiz.\" In other words, politics is a tough game and Brown has simply not proved tough enough for it. Good at governing he might be, but as a practitioner of the blood sport he's not quite top-notch. He lacks the killer instinct. </p> <p>Yet this story may end in a twist. For what if Blair's skill was not so much in politics, as in short-term politics? Last week's move certainly brought a good instant hit on the TV news, swapping negative for positive coverage. But the after-effects of pre-announcing his own eventual resignation have not been good, even for Blair himself. Cartoonists are already depicting the prime minister as a lame duck. Drawing up the manifesto will be \"impossible\", says one insider, as former colleagues see each other as rivals in a now-declared leadership contest and position themselves accordingly. Rather than a smooth transition, which would have safeguarded his legacy, Blair has ensured a dogfight which could imperil it.</p> <p>Brown's long game, by contrast, might pay off. Trusted by the public, eschewing the short-term, quick hits of his neighbour, he remains the natural inheritor when the arrangement announced last week finally breaks down - as surely it will.</p> <p>There is a touch of the tortoise and the hare about this story. Until now, Blair's darting and weaving has kept him ahead, while Brown's steady plodding has held him in perennial second place. If Brown prevails, he would prove that government and politics are not different disciplines after all, that to succeed in one brings rewards in the other - eventually.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> <a href=\"mailto:freedland@theguardian.com\">freedland@theguardian.com</a></p>"
