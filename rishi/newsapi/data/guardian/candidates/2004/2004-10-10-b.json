  "<p>International casino operators are preparing to place a \u00a33.5 billion bet on the British public flocking to Vegas-style gambling developments.</p> <p>As a new Gambling Bill is expected to come before MPs this week, it is now clear just how much money casino bosses, mainly from Las Vegas, are prepared to invest if the UK relaxes its strict gaming laws. </p> <p>Seven operators, five from the US and two from South Africa, are behind the \u00a33.5bn investment frenzy. </p> <p>The biggest, MGM Mirage, has confirmed that if all its plans come to fruition it will spend 'in excess of \u00a31bn' building casinos that will contain entertainment complexes as well as 1,250 slot machines with \u00a31m jackpots, and numerous gaming tables. </p> <p>Isle of Capri, another Vegas operator, this weekend said it has struck 'six or so confidential agreements' with sports clubs and landowners and will splash out \u00a3350m. Its executive vice-president Allan Solomon said: 'Britain is the most attractive destination at the moment. We like the work ethic and the British people have a much greater propensity to gamble than in the United States.' </p> <p>The scale of imminent casino investment will present a dilemma for local authorities and regional development agencies who will decide where new regional casinos can go. On the one hand, they will welcome inward investment. But on the other hand, the social consequences could be dire. </p> <p>Government officials and casino bosses believe there will be more than 60 so-called 'regional' casinos, which will have 1,250 slot machines. Leisure industry experts at Ernst and Young this weekend said that in 10 years the full scale of casino development could have brought in as much as \u00a35bn. </p> <p>But there is deep unease among backbench Labour MPs who fear a rapid increase of gambling addiction if, as expected, legislation gets rubber-stamped before the next General Election. </p> <p>Some senior gambling figures have conceded it is 'inevitable' that rates of addiction will rise as more facilities open with gambling products never previously seen in Britain. </p> <p>America's Harrah's, in a joint venture with Gala of the UK, has said it will spend \u00a3600m building eight casinos. Las Vegas Sands, which has confirmed plans to build casinos in Glasgow, Sheffield and West Ham, is understood to want several more sites. Its investment at this stage will be \u00a3210m. Other investors include Caesar's Entertainment, which wants to open a \u00a375m mega-casino in Wembley. </p> <p>Sol Kerzner, the promoter of the Sun City complex in South Africa, plans venues in Manchester, Glasgow and at the Millennium Dome.

  "<p>On 27 October the people of Turkmenistan - a gas-rich, desert-dominated central Asian country - will be celebrating 13 years of independence from the former Soviet Union. There will be feasts and military parades in the gleaming capital, Ashgabat. But, like the Soviet-era buildings behind the marble facades, the fabric of society is crumbling under the rule of the man they will be praising: Saparmurat Niyazov, Turkmenbashi the Great, Turkmenistan's 'President for Life'.</p> <p>Turkmenistan, which is twice the size of the UK yet has a population of just 5m, has since seceding from the Soviet Union in 1991, 'acquired one of the worst totalitarian systems in the world', according to the European parliament. And central to this system is a cult of personality to match Mao Tse-Tung, Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong Il. Turkmenistan's President Niyazov is a man, after all, who has renamed the month of January - after himself.</p> <p>In the last decade, thousands of statues of Niyazov have been erected across the country. The grandest is 12 metres high and coated in gold leaf; it stands on top of a 75-metre tall monument in the centre of Ashgabat and rotates to face the sun. Airports, regions, meteorites, cities and schools have been renamed after the president and his parents. Meetings in his office are televised and broadcast weekly on the three state TV channels.</p> <p>As well as renaming January, Niyazov has renamed April after his mother, May after his father and September after his 'divinely inspired' masterwork, the Rukhnama. This 'book of the soul' dominates the life of his subjects. Written between 1997 and 2001, it fills bookstores across the country and has been made the cornerstone of an otherwise ravaged educational establishment. 'On a par with the Bible and the Koran, it is to be used as a Spiritual Guide,' writes Niyazov in the introduction, 'to remove the complexities and anguishes from day to day living.' There are regular pageants staged in sports stadiums depicting scenes from this opus, centring on the moral purity of his mother and father. And every morning at factories and schools the citizens sing the national anthem, which refers to Turkmenistan as 'The great creation of Turkmenbashi'. </p> <p>'If I was a worker and my president gave me all the things they have here in Turkmenistan, I would not only paint his picture, I would have his picture on my shoulder, or on my clothing,' Niyazov said earlier this year. 'I'm personally against seeing my pictures and statues in the street - but it's what people want.'</p> <p>Saparmurat Atajevich Niyazov was born in the small village of Kipcak on the outskirts of Ashgabat in 1940. His father died in the Second World War, while his mother and brother were among the 100,000 killed in an earthquake that destroyed the capital in 1948. Niyazov grew up in an orphanage and went to study in St Petersburg, before returning to Ashgabat to work as an engineer. He joined the Communist Party in 1962 and rose through the ranks before being chosen by the new Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to be General Secretary of the Communist Party of Turkmenistan in 1985. It was perceived that his marriage to a Russian wife and his upbringing in an orphanage made him free of any clan-allegiance - an important factor for a clan-based society like Turkmenistan's - and therefore perfect for the job. He was chosen to carry out Moscow's will because of his deference and obedience, and he proceeded to do so without dissent. </p> <p>Perhaps understandably, given his party background, Niyazov was not in favour of Turkmenistan's independence when the Soviet Union began to disintegrate. When it became inevitable, however, he embraced the new ideology as enthusiastically as he had the old, assuming power as president, prime minister and the chairman of the council of ministers, and promoting Turkmen nationalism as his central aim - always with himself at the centre. As the Soviet yoke fell away he assumed the name 'Turkmenbashi' ('father of the Turkmen'). He then set about forging the nation's new identity in his own image. Turkmen opposition figures were either driven into exile or imprisoned. (Most have since been released, but after their experiences in prison, and under constant surveillance since, those still in the country have never dared to speak out.)</p> <p>In 1992, Niyazov 'won' the first presidential elections unopposed, and settled into a Soviet-style dictatorship. His handpicked council of ministers voted him president for life in 1999. In 2001 the Humanitarian Association of the World's Ethnic Turkmens voted to suffix Niyazov's name with Beyt ('great'), much to the president's dismay. 'I am afraid of ever more titles - some even say I am a prophet,' he complained. </p> <p>State-owned newspapers are full of letters from citizens proclaiming their love for Niyazov. But loyalty to the president is not optional. Foreign newspapers are banned, and satellite TV is restricted and censored. The radio station Radio Free Europe/ Radio Liberty is jammed in most towns. For obvious reasons, news of nearby Georgia's 'Rose Revolution' - the American-engineered overthrow of Eduard Shevardnadze, last November - was not reported at all. </p> <p>Meanwhile, bugging of telephones is assumed to be rife. Members of the intelligence services, police and military are visible on the streets of Ashgabat and other towns. Access to the internet is limited and monitored. Public demonstrations have been suppressed ruthlessly and no longer take place at all. Only two religions are freely practised: Islam and orthodox Christianity. And freedom of movement is nonexistent: Turkmen citizens need permits to enter 'special closed zones' which cover 40 per cent of the country, and travel is restricted between rural areas and the cities. According to the former US Ambassador to Turkmenistan, Laura Kennedy: 'Turkmenbashi controls everything in this country. He personally decides who comes in, who goes out.' Announcing in March that government agencies would intensify their video surveillance of Turkmen citizens - installing cameras on every major street and site in the country - Niyazov said, 'We should know if a fly quietly buzzes past.'</p> <p>The cameras, he claims, are there 'not due to a lack of trust, but to avoid disorder'. And the consequences of 'disorder' are grave. Insulting Niyazov carries a minimum five-year prison sentence. Last year, terrifyingly vague treason laws were passed, carrying life imprisonment for anyone 'attempting to sow doubt among people about the internal and foreign policies conducted by the first and permanent president of Turkmenistan, the Great Saparmurat', or even 'encouraging opposition to the state'. Professor Jerrold Post - who founded the CIA's Center for the Analysis of Personality and Political Behavior, and is director of the Political Psychology Program at George Washington University - is building a psychological profile of Niyazov. 'There have only been a few cults of personality to match this; Kim Jong Il and Kim Il-sung in North Korea, and Mao Tse-Tung. The narcissism of the man is really beyond description - he has essentially turned himself into a living god.'</p> <p>Niyazov's grip on Turkmenistan tightened dramatically following the events of 25 November 2002, when shots were fired at the presidential motorcade. Deemed a set-up by some observers, it led to the arrests of hundreds of political opponents, journalists, intellectuals and their family members. A month later at least 59 suspects were jailed after televised show trials reminiscent of the Stalin era, during which defence lawyers actually apologised for representing their clients. These included a drugged and bruised Boris Shikhmuradov, formerly foreign minister, whose confession to masterminding the assassination attempt was clearly read from a script. 'I and my allies... are not opposition members but ordinary criminals and drug addicts... we are all worms... I am a criminal able only to destroy the state.' </p> <p>According to Amnesty International: 'The relatives of those imprisoned after the November 2002 events have still not been allowed to visit the prisoners. Many were tortured and there are indications that some died in prison, but there is no way of finding out the truth.' </p> <p>A ratcheting up of state repression followed across the board, including the sacking, in January 2003, of the chief mufti, Nasrullah ibn Ibadullah, who had led Turkmenistan's Muslims (the country's official religion) for the previous 10 years. Reports variously suggest he was suspected of involvement in the 'assassination' attempt, objected to having phrases from the Rukhnama written on the walls of mosques, or refused to declare publicly that Niyazov is 'God's prophet'. In March, Ibadullah was sentenced to 22 years in prison for reasons that remain unclear. In the same month two of the few independent journalists left in the country, from Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, were arrested, beaten, drugged and threatened against broadcasting within the country. An estimated 20,000 dissidents are now in prison. </p> <p>Niyazov writes in the Rukhnama: 'I am attempting to have a logical kind of freedom accepted and approved by this nation. Otherwise freedom will turn into irregularity and destroy the essentials of the state and harm the society.'</p> <p>Murad Turayev and Bayram Medrov (not their real names) are civil activists from the west and east of the country and have gathered and passed on information about the human rights situation in Turkmenistan at great personal risk. Turayev says the alienation felt by the majority of Turkmens is almost total: 'The country has been converted into a hopeless and sinister reservation closed from the outside world. The main part of the population simply doesn't have any interest in what happens. Extreme poverty, unemployment and drug-taking have produced fear and hopelessness.'</p> <p>Meanwhile, Niyazov continues unchecked. Ever more eccentric edicts are carried out by increasingly sycophantic flunkeys and Western companies who are happy to land vast construction contracts. In August, Niyazov broadcast on state TV perhaps his oddest plan yet. 'Let us build a palace of ice so our children can learn to ice skate,' he said, 'big and grand enough for 1,000 people.' With temperatures reaching 50C across much of the nation in summer, many people expected nothing to come of the idea, but Niyazov's favourite construction company, the French firm Bouygues, is scheduled to start on the \u00a313m project next month.</p> <p>Perhaps the biggest threat posed by Niyazov's regime is an artificial lake under construction in the Karakum desert, to be known as the Golden Age Lake. At an estimated cost of $6.5bn, it is expected by many scientists to reduce the scarce and vital water supplies of the desert nation through drainage and evaporation. Experts say the best expenditure of funds would be to dredge and re-line the Karakum canal which makes life possible for a large proportion of the Turkmen population. A senior Western official in Ashgabat, who refused to be named, believes Turkmenistan is at a crossroads. 'What it does in the next 50 years will determine what it will be like in the next 10,000 years. It will either be a country that can sustain a population of up to 8or 10 million forever, or it will go back to being a desert with a few watering holes. If it doesn't invest its hydrocarbon profits in the water infrastructure we will be bringing food aid in 50 years' time.</p> <p>'With the right leader,' says the official, 'it has a chance, but Niyazov's only looking at the next 25 years - he just wants people to be quiet while he fulfils his dreams of grandeur.'</p> <p>If one section of the population is the most sympathetic to its president it is the youth of Turkmenistan. According to Medrov: 'A new generation is emerging that knows nothing apart from official propaganda. Before, everyone spoke Russian, could watch TV and know something about what happens in the world, but this new generation only speaks Turkmen, so they are absolutely cut off from all this. Today's state rule is becoming popular among them and this is a new danger.'</p> <p>The brainwashing is intense. Children at nursery learn phrases from the Rukhnama in praise of the great Turkmenbashi before they can read; schoolchildren have to spend two hours a day reading and pondering the lessons it contains. Entrance to university, interviews for jobs in the administration, even driving tests, depend on knowledge of the text. Earlier this year four Russian-speaking officials in the city of Turkmenbashi (formerly Krasnovodsk) were sacked after failing the Rukhnama exam. One high-school maths teacher in Ashgabat misread the question 'What are the names of the mother and father of the president's horse?' and instead named the president's mother and father. As a result, she was denied accreditation. </p> <p>Erika Dailey, director of the Open Society Institute's Turkmenistan Project, says: 'The government encourages children to go home and quiz their parents on the Rukhnama - and to tell their teacher if they are lacking in knowledge.' Meanwhile, parents know their children have no alternative route to success other than winning cash prizes and appearances on TV by singing songs and reciting poems in praise of Niyazov. The education system is already hamstrung by the removal of children aged 10 and over to harvest cotton from September to November, and the shortening of the state education period from 11 to 9 years. Ballet, opera, the circus and the cinema are banned in Turkmenistan - condemned by Niyazov as contrary to national traditions. And a law passed last November required non-governmental organisations to re-register, heralding the closure of groups from ecology clubs to a sports club for disabled teenagers. The scope for development is shrinking all the time.</p> <p>The only head of state the 40 per cent of the population under the age of 14 have ever known is President Niyazov. According to Murad Turayev: 'The new generation of young boys and girls... consider it absolutely normal to read the Rukhnama and give all these oaths to the president. For a quarter of the country's population, the Rukhnama is virtually the only book they will have read.'</p> <p>The anonymous Western official adds: 'Within one or two generations you will find a population of younger people who are totally useless, incapable of living in modern society.'</p> <p>Yet this generation plays an increasingly important role in Niyazov's heavily policed state. Military service is two years and usually starts at 17 years old. Groups of teenagers with Kalashnikovs check the documents of people driving across the country. In order to bolster the failing economy conscripts work as lorry drivers, bakers, train attendants, traffic police and factory workers. On 11 February Niyazov sacked a third of the medical workforce - around 15,000 nurses and healthcare workers - by presidential decree, replacing them with conscripts to save the state money. The Western official says that a priority for the country is 'trained people to run its services and its oil and gas industry. At the moment they have to buy in all their technicians from all over the world. If they don't keep pumping, which pays for the massive subsidy system to the nation, this country will slip into chaos.' </p> <p>Niyazov claimed on independence that Turkmenistan would be the new Kuwait. Bordering the Caspian Sea, the country has vast proven gas reserves - the fifth largest in the world - and plenty of oil. By 2001 this was modified to a promise that within a year every family would have 'a house, a car, and a cow with calf'. This promise was then dropped for the more ambiguous propaganda slogan that 'the 21st century is the golden age of the Turkmens'. </p> <p>Yet gas production is still not back up to the levels of the early Nineties. Plans to build pipelines to Western markets in the Arabian gulf or Mediterranean have foundered, due to regional instability and Niyazov's unpredictability. The state provides free gas and water, cheap housing and bread, and for the men in Ashgabat at least, horse races. But anecdotally - for there are no hard statistics on Turkmenistan - unemployment, underemployment and non-payment of salaries are rife and worsening; state services are disintegrating; life expectancy falling. The free supply of gas and water is at the heart of all of Niyazov's claims to be a generous, successful leader. When he introduced the system 12 years ago it was supposed to remain in place for a decade before people began to pay. The anonymous Western official says, 'If these services were withdrawn there would be chaos, you'd be looking at a revolution.'</p> <p>Meanwhile, despite EU and UN resolutions requesting that the Turkmen authorities co-operate with international human rights organisations, no such co-operation has ensued. Certain laws - the introduction of exit visas, the restriction of religious practice - have been amended, but in practice little has changed; people cannot leave the country freely and they are free only to practise the central religions. </p> <p>Human Rights Watch believes international organisations have some leverage: 'The Turkmen government takes great pride in its UN membership. The UN must make clear that [Turkmenistan's] failure to co-operate is unacceptable.'</p> <p>Aaron Rhodes, executive director of the International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights, says that support from major foreign governments is needed: 'Much more could be done to force peaceful change; if major world leaders with authority would acknowledge that this is a dictatorship, depriving people of rights, this would really have an effect.' </p> <p>But there are other factors to consider. The US Airforce benefits from being able to fly its jets through Turkmen airspace. The vast reserves of gas and oil in Turkmenistan have been the subject of frantic lobbying by Western governments in the past, and the possibility of securing access in the future must act as a brake to any criticisms of Niyazov. In fact, a high-level Russian delegation visiting Niyazov earlier in the year praised his achievements as 'fantastic' and the Rukhnama as 'a serious philosophical work'. They also signed a co-operation agreement designed to encourage joint investment in the fishing industry, mining and, most importantly, gas production. </p> <p>According to Rhodes, 'There's a tremendous tendency to support the status quo. People don't want to rock the boat, they don't need another failed state on their hands. They probably would like to see Turkmenbashi keep power.' </p> <p>Erika Dailey believes the status quo will lead to disaster. 'If the trend continues, and neither economic nor political reform is introduced soon, Turkmenistan will become non-functional, a failed state.'</p> <p>Robert Corzine is one of the few Western journalists to have met Niyazov. In his experience, the president is unlikely to be unduly swayed by outside influence. He recalls an interview in 1999 in which the subject of the oil- and gas-rich Caspian Sea arose: 'Niyazov got a map and said, \"I'll tell you who owns the Caspian,\" and he took out his $1,000 pen, crossed out the word Azeri Oilfield [property of Azerbaijan] and wrote Serdar ['leader' - his name] Oilfield in its place. Stabbing the map he said, \"That's mine, that's mine.\" When I left the meeting, his then foreign minister Boris Shikhmuradov, who was more of a suave character, said, \"You can tone down some of the things the president said.\" But Niyazov, who had overheard, said: \"No, he can write whatever he wants.\" The next day when the story appeared the Azerbaijanis sent gunboats out.'</p> <p>Despite a recent heart bypass operation there are no serious indications that Niyazov has a succession plan: an election mooted for 2008 is expected to disappear like previous dates, and he will almost certainly rule until he dies. According to one Western observer Niyazov won't be worried about succession, either: 'He wants to leave the greatest mosque and all his buildings and monuments, and go down in history as the great salvation of Turkmenistan and the greatest Khan - greater even than Tamburlaine or Ghengis Khan.'</p>",
  "In his fading years, the American architect Frank Lloyd Wright embarked on a final grand project. Invited in 1957 by King Faisal of Iraq to design a new opera house, Wright expanded the brief into a plan for Baghdad complete with museums, parks, university and authentic bazaar. Dispensing with his 'prairie style', he peppered the scheme with domes, spires and ziggurats. <p>The 1958 revolution meant that none of it was built. But the ever-resourceful Wright simply offered the design to a new client. And today, the Baghdad opera house is the Grady Gammage Memorial Auditorium at Arizona State University: an example of Wright's versatility and the forum for next week's presidential debate. Under the arches of a lost Iraqi skyline, George W Bush and John Kerry will meet in debate for the final time. </p> <p>It could scarcely be more appropriate in an election dominated by foreign affairs to an extent not seen since the Vietnam war. Friday night's second debate started and finished with WMD, the role of weapons inspectors and the use/misuse of intelligence. In the event, both sides walked away from St Louis, Missouri, with something to celebrate. </p> <p>In contrast to their first encounter, Bush, as one commentator put it, 'turned up': he was energetic, engaged, supple and often intelligible. Following on from Dick Cheney's highly effective blocking of John Edwards in the vice-presidential debate, the Republican tail-spin of the past few days has come to a halt. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Kerry continued to look and sound presidential. As ever, he was authoritative and suitably aggressive - but, at last, he also gave something of himself. In a response to a question on abortion, he finally started to talk about his Catholic faith and break down some of that Brahmin reserve. Yet even if an instant poll gave Kerry a slim victory, he failed to deliver the knock-out. With only 23 days left to the election and Bush still fractionally leading, a decisive blow is what is needed for the final head-to-head. </p> <p>Here in Arizona, Kerry's strategy to focus so determinedly on foreign policy could play either way. This is a state on the domestic front-line in the 'war on terror', producing one of the most celebrated victims of the neo-conservative movement. </p> <p>Pat Tillman was an all-American hero, a graduate of Arizona State University who went on to play professional football for the Arizona Cardinals, only to forego a lucrative future with the NFL to enlist, alongside his brother, Kevin, as an Army Ranger. </p> <p>Laid-back and highly popular, he was the quiet warrior of America's global imperium. But after initial deployment in the Middle East, he was transferred to Afghanistan where, in April, he was killed by 'friendly fire'. </p> <p>Unlike the hundreds of other deaths, Tillman's sacrifice jolted the myopic complacency of US public opinion. Arizona went into mourning as the Cardinals retired his number 40 and 'Pat Tillman Freedom Plazas' were planned. </p> <p>But on his former campus, underground posters have started appear with the haunting refrain, 'Remember me?', asking whether 'I' needed to die for 'Bush's wars'. </p> <p>Despite the losses, it would take a substantial shift for this electorate to dismiss their commander-in-chief mid-war. Arizona is, after all, a state which grew rich in the post-war years on the back of the military-industrial complex. </p> <p>Its clear skies proved ideal for pilot training, drawing in high-tech firms in their wake. Today, it retains that martial spirit, with an array of military bases and culture of service - not least in the form of its popular senator, Vietnam veteran John McCain (whom many now regard as the leading Republican candidate for 2008). </p> <p>Moreover, since the 1950s Arizona has been seen as the birthplace of modern Conservatism. It was from this rugged landscape that Barry Goldwater emerged. His anti-government credo - 'Extremism in the defence of liberty is no vice' - set the modern Republican party on its course. Under Goldwater's guidance, power drifted from the Rockefeller moderates to the free market individualists of southern and western America. </p> <p>Although Goldwater lost catastrophically to Lyndon Johnson in 1964, his anti-Communist, laissez-faire ideals would triumph in Ronald Reagan. And now, in Bush, many Arizonans see a south-western compatriot ready to defend gun-ownership, gas-guzzling SUVs, and 'traditional values'. </p> <p>But while Bush continues to lead Kerry in Arizona by 10 points, hope is in the air for Democrats. Recent polls have shown a marked increase in undecided voters, as well as another 500,000 people registering to vote. And, in a state that only went Bush by 6 per cent in 2000, that could be enough to make the difference. </p> <p>The final debate is in theory focused on domestic policy, but will inevitably slide back towards Iraq. So far, one of the more effective tactics of the Kerry campaign has been to emphasise how America is bearing 90 per cent of the war's costs. This week, Kerry's challenge is to link that $200 billion expenditure to faltering economic confidence at home. </p> <p>The middle-class boom of the Clinton years is a thing of the past. House prices, college fees, health costs, even petrol prices are creating what Kerry exaggerates as 'a crisis of the middle class'. Those concerns, together with worries over the fiscal deficit and mounting unemployment, need to be connected in the popular imagination with the Iraqi war mismanagement. </p> <p>To do so, Kerry might follow the lead set by Goldwater's apprentice, Reagan. In his 1980 debate with President Carter, held amid another US foreign policy debacle in the Middle East and rising costs of living, Reagan suggested to his audience: 'It might be well if you would ask yourself, are you better off than four years ago? Is it easier for you to go and buy things in the stores? Is America as respected as it was?' </p> <p>Then, as now, the answer was 'no' and a one-term incumbent was ousted from office. This Wednesday, another act of regime change might be enacted under the arches and palm trees of a Baghdad skyline. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Tristram Hunt is a visiting professor at Arizona State University.</p>",
  "They came from opposite corners, striding to the centre to meet for a brief but firm handshake. Then President George Bush and John Kerry retreated to their chairs. They would not look each other in the eye again for 90 minutes. <p>When the second presidential debate was over, it was Bush who was probably happier. 'Thank you all very much. It's been enjoyable,' he said. He needed a result, and as America digests the St Louis debate it seems he got it. Just. The two men had faced each other in a converted university gym - two political prizefighters. Bush was entering Round Two of the presidential match with a bloody nose. Round One in Florida eight days earlier had left his campaign in disarray. In just one evening of verbal jousting - and Bush's sourness and scowling - Kerry had hauled himself back into the race. A slew of national polls showed him narrowly behind the President or drawing level. One even showed him ahead. That was compounded by repeated bloody attacks in Iraq and the final word on Saddam's weapons of mass destruction: they did not exist. </p> <p>The fight for the White House was suddenly back on. Kerry had retired to a Colorado hotel, where staff built a mock-up of the St Louis auditorium in the resort's ballroom. His longtime friend, lawyer Greg Craig, played the part of Bush. But the real Bush had been busy too. Top aides sat with him as they poured over videos of the Florida debacle and showed him how his facial contortions had played so badly across the televisions of America. By the time he entered the highly-controlled environment of the St Louis debate he was fully prepared. He knew a repeat of Florida could cripple his attempt to win a second term. </p> <p>The fight began at a furious pace. The first questioner, from an audience of handpicked potential wavering voters, asked Kerry to defend himself against being 'wishy-washy'. Kerry's response was to jab straight at Bush. 'The President didn't find weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, so he's really turned his campaign into a weapon of mass deception,' he jibed. </p> <p>Bush hit right back, accusing Kerry of changing his opinion on a host of topics, but especially the war in Iraq. 'I can see why people think he changes position quite often. Because he does.' Game on. </p> <p>Spin alley in St Louis was a converted practice gym where the painted lines on the wooden basketball courts were covered by the cables of computers and TV cameras. It was here that top aides from both campaigns collared journalists to try and spin their side's point of view. But Spin Alley is also a state of mind. Few debates turn on any single moment. The fight to declare a winner goes on for at least 48 hours after the 90 minutes are up. Public opinions form in days, not minutes, and it is in Spin Alley that the first shots are fired in that media battle. </p> <p>Even before the debate was finished, campaign staffers were pouring into the room. By the time it was over, a sea of placards filled the floor. Dotted here and there were the orange signs indicating one of the big sharks in the room, emblazoned with the surname of Bush's political gurus Karl Rove and Karen Hughes. They moved through the masses crying victory. 'The President dominated this debate tonight. He clearly won,' Hughes declared. But the Democrats were out in force too, hitting the airwaves and working the room. They took shots at Bush's performance. 'He lost his control,' said Democrat National Committee chairman Terry McAuliffe. 'He doesn't know there is a problem, so he can't fix it,' mocked top staffer Joe Lockhart. </p> <p>But the beginnings of a consensus were soon starting to emerge. There had been no knockout blow for either side. Honours were even. But that meant Bush had won through to keep on fighting. In Republican terms, that was enough for a celebration. Bush has probably now stopped the collapse that at times last week seemed about to swamp his campaign. </p> <p>It had not begun that way. The war in Iraq had dominated the first 40 minutes of the debate, and Bush had seemed perilously close to losing his temper. Kerry began aggressively. '[Saddam] didn't have weapons of mass destruction,' he bluntly told the audience. 'The world is more dangerous today because the President didn't make the right judgments.' </p> <p>As Bush struggled not to frown or smirk or grimace, it seemed as if Florida Mark II was about to play itself out. Kerry followed up by mentioning Bush's father in a clever ploy designed to press the son's psychological buttons. A few seconds later, when Kerry had finished slamming Bush's lack of allies in Iraq, Bush stormed forward, cutting off the moderator's attempts to move the debate forward. 'You tell Tony Blair we're going alone!' Bush almost shouted, his voice rising with emotion. </p> <p>But if Bush was fighting to keep his self control, it was a fight he won. Kerry seemed slightly taken aback by Bush's outburst, and Bush followed up by going on the attack himself, lambasting Kerry as someone who would seek international permission for America's actions. It was a tactic that gradually put Kerry on the defensive. Bush switched into campaign mode, trotting out a familiar portrait of Kerry as a wimp who could not be a commander-in-chief and keep America safe. Bush was now speaking in a soft and folksy tone, turning up the Texas twang. The anger was under control. 'I don't think my opponent has the right view about the world to make us safe, I really don't,' he said. </p> <p>Then, as the debate switched to domestic matters, Bush gradually displayed an increasing mastery of the 'town hall' format of the St Louis debate. He prowled around the hall for every question, often even standing as Kerry spoke. He looked directly at the questioners, thanking them by name. He seemed at ease. It was a style familiar to any who have followed Bush on the campaign trail. Though, of course, it did not prevent him from making the usual handful of verbal blunders, such as referring to a rumour about reinstating the draft on the 'internets'. </p> <p>Yet Kerry is no slouch at town hall debates either. Almost two years of campaigning in primaries and for the White House have left him at home in public meetings. The debate settled down into a detailed discussion of taxes and healthcare. </p> <p>For Bush it must have been a relief, and he began to deliver a scathing attack on Kerry's 20 years as a senator, painting him as a tax-and-spend liberal out of touch with mainstream America. Bush began to seize the initiative and deliver the campaign 'zingers' dreamt up the previous week. 'He's got a record. He's been there 20 years. You can run, but you can't hide,' Bush said. </p> <p>Several times Kerry implored the audience at home to see through the image Bush was painting. 'The President is just trying to scare everyone here, throwing labels around,' he said. 'Labels don't mean anything.' </p> <p>Then came the moment which may be remembered no matter who wins the White House. A questioner asked Kerry if he would vow to camera never to raise taxes on middle-class America, raising the spectre of the elder Bush's 'Read my lips, no new taxes' pledge. Kerry took the bait. 'Yes. Right into the camera. Yes, I am not going to raise taxes,' Kerry said. </p> <p>By now Bush was relaxed and joking with the audience. 'Of course he's going to raise your taxes,' he laughed. Kerry became increasingly long-winded. On a question about government funding for abortion, Kerry gave a monologue on the ethical complexities of the issue and his own personal morality. Bush got up. 'I'm trying to decipher that [answer],' he said, shaking his head with a shrug 'My answer is we are not going to spend taxpayers' money on abortion.' A few Democrats sitting in Spin Alley noticeably winced. By the time the debate was finished, both sides in Spin Alley had enough to plausibly claim victory. Kerry had not suffered any killer blows, but he did not deliver any either. </p> <p>Bush recovered from his poor start to take control, and ended the stronger. For Bush a draw after Florida was enough to be called a win. </p> <p>What emerged most strongly was how starkly different the candidates are. Audience member Bren Pathenos, who said she came out of the chamber favouring Bush, had met both candidates after the contest. She had told them of her son serving in Iraq. While Bush had asked her to send her son his regards, saying 'Good job', Kerry had promised to work for the day when her son could be brought home. Here were two very different visions of the war. </p> <p>With less than a month to go, only one thing is clear: America remains divided. And undecided. The debates have had an impact in levelling the playing field again. Spin Alley still has work to do on shaping the result of the St Louis fight, but it is unlikely that the fundamental pattern will shift. Nor is it likely to change after the final debate this week in Arizona. 'The first poll after the last debate will be very instructive as to the future of the rest of the race,' said Ken Warren, a political scientist at St Louis University. 'I expect it to be virtually a dead heat.' </p> <p>As the candidates prepare for the final stretch, each is still seeking desperately to land one knockout blow. </p> <p><b>War of words</b></p> <p><b> The Bush view</b> </p> <p><b>On abortion </b><br> 'We're not going to spend taxpayers' money on abortion ... Culture of life is really important for a country to have if it's going to be a hospitable society.' </p> <p><b>On Iraq</b><br> 'I don't see how you can win in Iraq if you don't believe we should be there in the first place.' </p> <p><b>On healthcare</b><br> 'I've been in Washington DC three-and-a-half years and led the Congress to reform Medicare so that our seniors have got a modern health system. </p> <p><b>On the economy</b><br> 'He's going to tax everybody here to fund his programmes. That's just reality.' </p> <p><b> The Kerry view</b> </p> <p><b>On abortion</b><br> 'I think it's important for the US not to have this rigid ideological restriction on helping families to be able to make a smart decision about family planning.' </p> <p><b>On Iraq</b><br> 'The world is more dangerous today because the President did not make the right judgments.' </p> <p><b>On healthcare</b><br> 'Five million people have lost their health insurance under this President. He's done nothing about it.'</p> <p><b>On the economy</b><br> 'Now, the President has presided over an economy where we've lost 1.6 million jobs. The first President in 72 years to lose jobs.'</p>",
  "Democratic challenger John Kerry has cemented his recent surge in the opinion polls, with the latest showing him moving into a slight lead over George W Bush. <p>Kerry led the president by 46 to 45 per cent in a tracking poll released yesterday by respected firm Zogby International. Several other recent surveys showed him closing in on Bush, although most still had the incumbent with a slight advantage. </p> <p>Kerry has fought his way back into the race after strong performances in the first two national live televised debates. </p> <p>The second, on Friday in St Louis, Missouri, was a closer affair than the first, with both candidates attacking each other over Iraq and a host of domestic issues. </p> <p>Polls afterwards showed a narrow Kerry win, with ABC having him 44 per cent to 41 per cent ahead and CNN 47 per cent to 45 per cent. </p> <p>However, the gap was so small many pundits declared the debate a draw - a result likely to please the Republicans more than the Democrats. </p> <p>Bush performed poorly in the first debate and senior aides admitted privately that they could not afford to lose again. In particular Bush could not repeat the facial grimaces he had displayed first time around. Early on in the St Louis debate Bush tried to make light of his previous performance. 'That answer almost made me scowl,' he quipped after one Kerry statement. </p> <p>After a shaky start, where he appeared visibly angry, Bush improved as the debate wore on. He took advantage of the 'town hall' format to walk around the converted university gymnasium and employ his 'folksy' campaign demeanour. </p> <p>But Kerry also did well. He was deeply critical of Bush's policy on Iraq and accused him of having dragged America into a disastrous war. </p> <p>After Bush denied that he would reinstitute the military draft for Iraq, Kerry accused him of using the army reserves and National Guard mainstream units. 'You've got a back-door draft right now,' Kerry snapped. </p> <p>The pair will meet for the third and final time later this week in Arizona for a debate about domestic issues. Kerry is likely to view the confrontation as a last opportunity to deliver a knockout blow to Bush. </p> <p>The debates have revived his campaign, which had appeared to be meandering towards an increasingly likely defeat. Kerry's 'likeability' numbers in several polls have also rocketed, showing that his campaign is finally chipping away at the image of a wooden orator with an aloof air. </p> <p>Most importantly of all, surveys in the so-called battleground states have shown that Kerry has narrowed the gap on Bush. That even goes for Missouri, which played host to Friday night's debate. The state is seen as a bellwether which nearly always votes with the winning candidate. </p> <p>Bush had been ahead so strongly in Missouri that Kerry's campaign team had taken its adverts off the air waves, effectively conceding the state. Now, with the latest internal Democrat polls showing Kerry just one point behind Bush, the adverts are due to return to TV screens for the first time since July. </p> <p>But with just over three weeks to go until election day, most experts and campaign staffers admit it is too close to call and likely to remain that so. 'We think this race has settled into about a two-point advantage for us right now,' said Bush's chief strategist Matthew Dowd. </p> <p>Some experts believe it is even closer than that. That means any of a host of factors, ranging from the third candidacy of Ralph Nader to attacks in Iraq, could prove decisive in the final few days. </p> <p>David Lanoue, a political scientist at the University of Alabama, said: 'Any small changes can and do matter this year. It is simply too close to call.'</p>",
  "Busted have called it for Michael Howard. Not since Norman Lamont declared ' je ne regrette rien' over ERM have the Tories planted such a musical milestone. Supporters more culturally at home with the former Chancellor's Edith Piaf moment need not worry, though. <p>Even those who have never heard of Britain's favourite boy band will recognise Matt Jay's allegiance to the small state and modest personal taxation. Or, as Mr Jay put it in Tatler magazine: 'Yeah, actually, you know what, I am not going to be ripped off any more. From the financial position I am in now, I am a fucking Tory boy too.' </p> <p>Once such language would have gone down badly in the shires, but a party that has embraced Liam Fox's passion for Scissor Sisters must be getting inured to shock. And anyway, tastes change. While Kenny Everett's cry of 'Let's bomb Russia' elicited cheers at the Tory conference of 1983, something more hip is needed now. Though Rick Wakeman bravely filled the gap, he is, alas for right-wing cool, not much prettier than the thought of Nicholas Soames's first kiss. </p> <p>Personalities are essential to personal politics, and the Busted coup gives the Tories a fillip in a domain where, barring the Spice Girls' dalliance with Thatcherism, the liberal left has traditionally had the best cheerleaders. Springsteen sings for Kerry while Bush has to settle for Britney in a realm in which stars and politicians have fed off one another's variable lustre ever since JFK annexed Sinatra. The roll call of collusion is long and unsurprising: Nixon and Elvis; Major and Cilla; Blair and Blur. </p> <p>Now, like prions conniving at a mad cow epidemic, the categories are jumping species. At Labour's conference, Bono announced Gordon Brown and Tony Blair as the 'Lennon and McCartney of politics'. The U2 singer, never a mere party groupie, has been elevated to an international ambassador more beguiling, and in many ways more powerful, than premiers and presidents. </p> <p>While celebrities, from Reagan to Schwarzenegger, have moved into politics, convention decrees that they first bother to get elected. Now a different blend of celebrity and politician is emerging. The new hybrid strain of celebrician needs nothing more than an assumption of popular support, plus a knit-your-own mandate. Its first prophet is Bob Geldof. </p> <p>Even counting Alan Titchmarsh, Sir Bob is the most influential man in Britain. Having spent last week saving Africa, he will this week redraft family policy, introducing new legislation where required. Tomorrow, in the first of his prime-time, hour-long programmes on Channel 4, Geldof deals with marriage. The second, to be shown on Tuesday, is about fathers. </p> <p>Geldof is well-informed on Africa. Far from showboating at Blair's side, he had to overcome some government resistance to founding the Commission for Africa which has placed the continent back on the international agenda before the start of Britain's G8 presidency. The architect of Live Aid has also helped shift the politics of pity to those of justice. </p> <p>Geldof has not always been tactful, though, or right. His description of George W Bush as one of Africa's best friends in its fight against Aids and famine appalled aid agencies, and his charge last week that an EU aid official was 'talking out of his arse' will have made him enemies as well as friends. As David Mepham, of the Institute for Public Policy Research, says, the test of the Geldof vision, and the presidency, will be whether G8 countries can be made to revise rigged trade rules. </p> <p>If Geldof is broadly sound on Africa, the same cannot be said for his family values. Though Geldof on Marriage sounds more convincing than, say, Christina Aguilera on unified theory, one failed spell of matrimony does not justify the authority he assumes, or explain the drivel he produces. It is hard to find anything kind to say about a programme whose chief concession to feminism is the bit where Geoff Mulgan, the Number 10 strategist, has his attention drawn to 'a fucking great billboard of a girl's beautiful arse in a thong'. </p> <p>Elsewhere, Geldof appears to pin the breakdown of marriage on women 'sucked into the workplace' and thus unavailable to give a man what he wants, which is his tea on the table ('so sexy, so feminine') after a hard day's work. While dismissing the notion of marriage as 'happy couples shagging on the kitchen table', Geldof sketches an equally odd model of breadwinner husbands and tractable wives who should put up and shut up, since divorce will very possibly leave their children condemned to prison, suicide or failure. </p> <p>Materialism and an inflated sense of self (to which Geldof is obviously a total stranger) have led us, he concludes, to become 'voracious consumers of the soul' who ignore the biological determinism dictating that men are surly and that women should try harder to understand them. The sexes, he points out, are very different. </p> <p>Except in part two of the Geldof exposition, in which men are just like women and must therefore have a 50 per cent share of their children, post-divorce. While experts, such as Carol Smart of Leeds University, have done exhaustive studies showing that children dislike such rigid arrangements, Geldof is right to say that some caring fathers are unfairly excluded, as he once was. </p> <p>The problem is that neglectful or even dangerous men who leave their families in penury seem not to exist. Domestic violence is little more than an anti-dad ploy dreamed up by women, as is sexual abuse of children. A retired judge is called upon to conclude, airily, that 'not a lot' of abuse claims sound correct. Behind this sinister agenda, there are some genuine grievances. Family courts are, it is true, too slow, and fathers' roles are often-undervalued. </p> <p>But the Geldof remedies are either draconian or risible, or both. Anyone for much tougher divorce, or life-means-life marriages, imposed by a state whose interference Geldof, in general, detests? </p> <p>The Fred Flintstone school of family policy will find favour with no politicians other than hardline Tories. If anyone told Busted about it, they might be off to join Respect. But because Geldof is whitewashed with veneration, he has no trouble attracting politicians as talking heads. There are parts for Alan Milburn, discussing the role of the stay-at-home dad (retired) and for Margaret Hodge, who - almost alone of Geldof's expert witnesses - has the boldness to imply that he is talking garbage. </p> <p>Obviously, there is nothing to stop Geldof rewriting family law on television, as long as someone is daft enough to offer him the airtime to do it. His polemics may even have the useful side-effect of reminding voters that timid, equivocal politicians are more useful than they sometimes seem. </p> <p>None the less, it is depressing that the same shoddy, quick-fix values Geldof deplores give him his licence to disinter a way of living that expired half a century ago, and to sell his credo with the confidence of an honorary statesman. As George Michael sang, during his own mercifully brief flirtation with political doggerel, 'it's like we're getting fresh out of democratic'. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:mary.riddell@observer.co.uk\">mary.riddell@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "Chaos was enveloping Afghanistan's fragile presidential election last night after all 15 candidates challenging Hamid Karzai declared they were boycotting the poll over alleged voter fraud. <p>UN and Afghan officials rejected the call, insisting that difficulties involving indelible ink did not warrant abandoning the historic vote. </p> <p>The controversy surfaced within hours of polls opening yesterday morning, when voters in several areas complained that ink used by election officials to stain people's fingers - to prevent multiple voting - easily rubbed off. </p> <p>The possibility of fraud has dogged the Afghan election since thousands registered to vote several times, thinking their vote cards would bring them money or free food. </p> <p>'This vote is a fraud,' said Abdul Satar Sirat, the Uzbek candidate who rallied the complainants. 'It should be stopped. We don't recognise the results.' </p> <p>But officials with the joint UN-Afghan body organising the poll rejected the call. 'Halting the vote at this stage is unjustified and would deny these people their right to vote,' said vice-chairman Ray Kennedy. The election cost $20m to organise and at least 12 Afghan officials have been murdered by the Taliban. </p> <p>The UN focused the blame on poorly-trained officials who, they said, had used an ink intended to mark ballot papers - instead of the indelible one - as the anti-fraud device. But millions of Afghans still flooded to the polls, bringing with them hopes that the ballot box would mark the closing chapter of a 25-year saga of bloodshed, war and suffering. </p> <p>At 7.55am, 70-year-old Mohammed Zaffar cast his vote in the battered village of Chuquri, which has seen a century's worth of battles. British colonists, Soviet soldiers and black-turbaned Taliban have marched, bombed or shot their way through this mud-walled, hilltop hamlet. </p> <p>'I prayed, had breakfast and came here. I thought about who to vote for on the way,' explained Zaffar. </p> <p>Behind him, a trickle of men braved the sharp morning chill to enter the barbed wire voting enclosure. Some arrived by donkey, others drove herds of sheep. </p> <p>Over 100,000 US, Nato-led and Afghan security forces had been placed on high alert across the country as voters streamed into bombed-out schools, health clinics and mosques to choose among 16 candidates, of whom the favourite was the charismatic interim president Karzai. </p> <p>But celebration bells were muted by the eruption of the fraud row that could yet scupper the vote. Despite repeated threats of violence Taliban insurgents failed to terrorise the vote, although there were several foiled attacks - on Friday a bomb-sniffing dog discovered a petrol tanker laden with 40,000 litres of fuel, rigged with anti-tank mines, and intended for detonation in Kandahar, a Defence Ministry spokesman said. </p> <p>But while some stations were crowded, others were virtually empty. Polling got off to a sluggish start at rural stations like Chuquri where, 90 minutes after voting started, only about 60 men and no women had voted. </p> <p>'They will come later. Some people have to walk for hours to arrive, and the weather is very cold,' predicted returning officer Dr Muhammad Zahir. But fear may have also been a factor. Taliban had posted 'night letters' in Chuquri the night before, threatening to fire rockets into the booths. </p> <p>Inexperience and bias also affected the poll. The Chuquri station opened late while officials struggled to position polling booths and set up registration tables. Zahir, who openly announced his preference for Karzai, accompanied several older voters inside the curtained booth. 'They cannot read or write so I am just showing them the photos,' he explained. </p> <p>In Kabul a dust storm on Friday blanketed the capital in a thick haze seen by some as an ill omen. But the interim president Karzai maintained an upbeat tone. 'It is not important who wins,' he said as he cast his vote under tight security in the prime minister's office. 'The people are choosing their destiny and eventually if I win or any other one, the victory will be of the Afghan people.' </p> <p>As polls started to close at around 4pm yesterday, most of the political focus was on the controversy over ink and possible fraud. </p> <p>Abdul Wahab, 45, sat with other disabled voters outside the Maraston Hostel in Kabul for war-wounded or widowed families. Wahab, who lost a leg stepping on a landmine five years ago, hobbled across a busy road on a pair of crutches to cast his vote. </p> <p>Like many, he refused to disclose his preference, but stressed he was banking on the election to pull his country out of the chaos wrought by Soviet occupation, the Taliban and then the US invasion after 11 September. </p> <p>'Now people realise we have to use a pen instead of a gun. That's the new fight,' he said, pointing to his 12-year-old son Qais. 'Look at him. He was born in war. Now I want a bright future for him.'</p>",
  "<p>Geore Bush has got my fingerprints. It did not take him, or rather his genial representatives at Dulles airport, long. What took the time was a two-hour wait in the passport queue to reach him. A number of us aliens will have something to say next time a US official or economist lectures us on the need for structural reform and greater flexibility in Europe. </p> <p>I imagine the Chancellor of the Exchequer had an easier passage through passport control, and I have no idea whether his fingerprints were taken too, just in case he might despair of ever winning approval for his ambitious schemes for relieving poor countries of their debt, and be tempted to take up terrorism instead. </p> <p>For James D Wolfensohn, the president of the World Bank and one of the stars of last weekend's annual meetings of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) in Washington, terrorism and poverty are closely connected. 'Recent research suggests that a lack of economic opportunity, and the resulting competition for resources, lies at the root of most conflicts over the last 30 years, more than ethnic, political and ideological issues,' says Wolfensohn. </p> <p>The retiring president adds: 'T'his research supports the intuitive idea that if people have jobs, and if they have hope, they are less likely to turn to violence.'</p> <p>Gordon Brown did not get nearly as far as he would have liked last week with his 'debt initiatives'. It was not just recalcitrant Germans who were the problem. An official involved commented: 'The US won't budge. Apart from anything else, the IMF itself has a financing problem, and is not going to sell gold to finance the Chancellor's debt-relief plans.' </p> <p>We shall see. Group of Seven finance ministers referred the various proposals for further study. The Bush administration is more interested in debt relief for Iraq, where unemployment is said to be well over 50 per cent, and evidence that the US/UK invasion has created a breeding ground for terror becomes stronger by the day. </p> <p>Although he did not get far on debt, the Chancellor was widely praised for his handling of the IMF's key policy committee, of which he is a chairman. At the subsequent press conference he expressed surprise that there had been no questions about oil, because, without doubt, oil was one of the key topics at official meetings and fringe seminars. </p> <p>Those with long memories will recall that the Third World debt crisis began after the 'oil shocks' of the 1970s. What used to happen at IMF meetings in those days was that governments would encourage the 'recycling' of the spare millions (even billions) that the newly rich oil-exporting countries had to invest, and bankers - eager to make a turn - would not ask too many questions about the viability of African economies to which they offered money. </p> <p>It was the financial markets' rather belated discovery that Britain possessed North Sea oil that led to an embarrassing surge in the pound in 1977, within months of Denis Healey's having to turn back at the airport to face a major sterling crisis. (He never got to the 1976 IMF meeting. They sent a team to him.) </p> <p>My sense of last weekend's meetings is that there is an atmosphere of suppressed panic about the oil price, and about the danger of a serious crisis. This is over and above the well-publicised concerns about potential storms in the foreign-exchange markets when the financial world finally becomes nervous about the mani festly unsustainable US budget and balance-of-payments deficits - a nervousness which may well surface shortly after the presidential election. </p> <p>Oil prices loomed large in the statement by G7 finance ministers and central-bank governors, which conceded: 'Oil prices remain high and are a risk. So first, we call on oil producers to provide adequate supplies to ensure that prices remain moderate. Second, it is important consumer nations increase energy efficiency. Third, it is important for consumers and producers that oil markets function efficiently and we encourage the IEA (International Energy Agency) to enhance its work on oil data transparency.' </p> <p>The call for 'adequate supplies' is an obvious sign of concern. The call for increased efficiency contrasts with all those complacent analyses we have seen recently suggesting that the world is much less vulnerable to an oil shock that it was in the 1970s and 1980s. Efficiency? According to the US Energy Information Administration, US oil consumption rose by 16 per cent between 1973 (the year of the first oil shock) and 2003, whereas in France it dropped 21 per cent. (France, of course, invested heavily in nuclear energy.) </p> <p>I am not forecasting that oil prices are going to remain at $50 a bulk barrel or even rise a lot higher. But the fear is there. And I can report that the price of oil has been obsessing Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan. One regular visitor to his office said that, although the chairman's desk was covered as usual by sta tistical papers, this time they were not about interest rates but oil. </p> <p>The other big worry in Washington was the poor performance of business investment in recent years, at a time when, in the words of one official, 'consumers have been spending virtually everything they have, and the savings rate is down to 1 per cent'. </p> <p>'The reasons are not economic,' said one senior official on the investment scene. 'When people are depressed, they go out and spend,' is one popular explanation, and there was much talk of the impact of those notorious Enron-style scandals on the animal spirits of businessmen. </p> <p>But to return to oil - because everybody I met seemed to return to oil. While officials tried endlessly to place their faith in the improved techniques of the oil industry and better extraction results from individual fields, the fear of terrorism was marked. </p> <p>Back in England, the first items of economic news to grab one's attention were the poor recent figures for industrial production here, and the warning by the president of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, that the oil price posed threats to the already very modest recovery of the eurozone.</p> <p>Oh, and by the way, I only had my fingerprints taken once, but at Washington National Airport, on my way to interview Professor Galbraith, I was told at the security desk: 'Your airline has selected you for additional screening.' There was the option of enjoying this extra privilege in private. What, in George Bush's America? They must be joking.</p>",
  "<p>'Our oil under their sand!' 'Drive at 90mph and freeze a Yank!' </p> <p>Those are two rather tasteless and frivolous comments on currently the greatest economic problem the world is facing - the leviathan price of crude oil. Few are cognisant of the fact that oil represents 4 per cent of the world's GDP. Nymex crude currently stands at about $53 a barrel and is showing very little sign of easing from such an exalted pinnacle. On a comparative basis of inflation, this is some way short of the equivalent $75 a barrel which prevailed in 1980/81. Nonetheless this is a real problem, which the world seems happy enough to shrug off and bury under the carpet in the hope that it will eventually disappear. It also seems extraordinary to many that neither the President of the United States nor Senator John Kerry has an energy policy and the UK has not had an Energy Secretary since 1994. </p> <p>With the exception of Exxon Mobil, most oil companies believe that there is no shortage of crude, but clearly the industry has been neglected for years. Opec has failed to invest in production since 1998. It is 27 years since an oil refinery was built in the US. Tankers and refineries are now outdated and it takes two and five years respectively to build them for specification and use. </p> <p>It seems extraordinary to me that the world forgot about China and India in its recent calculations. It may come as a bolt from the blue that China is Saudi Arabia's largest customer. The demand for crude oil has increased from 1.2 billion barrels a day in 1985 to 2.75 billion barrels today.</p> <p>Can the price of oil fall in the immediate future? There are plenty of data suggesting the world will be lucky to see oil at $38 a barrel by the third quarter of 2005. The retail investor is long of oil at $42 and there is more than a little evidence that these positions have not been fully hedged with wholesale parties. Contracts in oil futures have doubled in record trading conditions in August and September, which could underpin the price.</p>",
  "<p>John Kerry and George Bush may have been slugging it out with great gusto on Friday night but according to Steven Andrew, chief economist with Isis Asset Management, this is a 'good election to lose'. Whoever emerges as the victor on 2 November - and, Friday night's performances notwithstanding, it is still too close to call - they will have the same issues to deal with; a budget deficit expected to top $445 billion this year, companies that are fearful that this is as good as profits are going to get; and consumers who, courtesy of mass remortgaging and Bush's tax bribes, have been encouraged to spend tomorrow's income today. </p> <p>Kerry has made a reduction in the budget deficit a central plank in his campaign, pledging to reverse Bush's tax cuts for those earning more than $200,000 a year. That should be possible but, with most observers expecting Congress to stay in Republican hands, he is likely to struggle to get any other big tax changes through. And, if investors sense that he is struggling to control the deficit, the bond market could start to get the jitters, and the overseas investors who have kept the dollar from falling even more than it has could also get a bit more nervous. </p> <p>Bush faces the same problem - and he is not only committed to making the tax cuts permanent, he would find it hard to make cuts in obvious areas such as defence and military spending given that his entire re-election campaign hinges on his conviction that he was right to go to war against Iraq. </p> <p>Of course, it is still possible that the US economy will spring back to life. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, at least, believes this is just a 'soft patch' and that demand will recover - although he also promises to keep interest rates as low as needed, for as long as needed, to ensure the recovery is not derailed. We will get some clues about the outlook from the third quarter reporting season, which kicks off in earnest this week, but if the recent trading statements from companies such as Intel and Cisco, Colgate and Coca-Cola are anything to go by, the news is unlikely to be uplifting. Factor in a stubbornly high oil price and that consumers no longer have tax cuts or re-mortgaging windfalls to spend, and it is hard to see where the impetus will come from. </p> <p>The stock market came to that conclusion some months ago; while the FTSE 100 is at its highest for 27 months, the Dow is 200 points below where it was six months ago. That, combined with the profit increases being posted at the start of the year, means that the valuation of the US market now looks a bit less extravagant than it did. </p> <p>But, as John Hatherly, head of global analysis at M&amp;G points out, at between 16 and 17 times expected earnings for the current year, it still looks expensive compared with the 12 or 13 times earnings for the British and European stock markets - particularly when there is uncertainty over whether the analysts' forecasts on which those earnings estimates are based will have to be downgraded further as the third-quarter results and outlook statements are issued. </p> <p>Mike Lenhoff, global strategist at Brewin Dolphin, thinks the pessimism is underdone. While the 4 to 5 per cent economic growth enjoyed earlier in the year is clearly unsustainable, the 3 to 4 per cent which he is expecting is still healthy enough. But above all, stock markets hate uncertainty and investors in the US have got more jittery since Kerry's campaign was kick-started by his good showing in the first election debate. That is likely to continue until the result of the election is clear. </p> <p>On the face of it, there is then scope from some rebalancing of portfolios depending on who wins: Kerry's promise to cut healthcare costs could be bad for an already beleaguered pharmaceutical sector; the defence sector could be favoured under a Bush win. But that is tinkering at the margins. The bigger question is what happens to the economy - and November's result will make little difference to that.</p>"
