  "<p>The office of Australia's longest-serving prime minister Sir Robert Menzies was famously decorated by two framed images. One was a painting by Tom Roberts, capturing the austere, sun-blasted beauty of a bush landscape; the other was a photograph of Keith Miller leaning back to put the finishing touch on a square cut at the Sydney Cricket Ground in 1950. </p> <p>Any symbolism was unconscious. Yet here, perhaps, seemed the first and last word on Menzies's country: the elemental and primal antiquity of the land, and the breezy and expansive youthfulness of its people. For no one since the second world war has fitted the bill of Australian in excelsis so exactly as Miller. </p> <p>An Australian might hope to have been born a Bradman, but there was only really room for one Don in the firmament. Miller not only did everything a cricketer would want to do, but the way they would want to do it, wrapped in an infectious personality that radiated carefree ease one moment and virile hostility the next. </p> <p>He batted with classical technique and utter abandon, playing each ball, as Raymond Robertson-Glasgow put it so exquisitely, \"just that much below its supposed merits that scratches a bowler's pride\". He could touch speeds of bowling reserved for few, so that rivals were loth to rouse him. \"The worst mistake a batsman could make,\" recalled Sir Leonard Hutton, \"was to hit him for four.\" </p> <p>Lounging deceptively at slip, Miller stood out even when unoccupied. He was a game of cricket in himself; he could even, when the circumstances dictated it, ooze an unstudied boredom. Though Australians distrust exhibitionism, they esteem the natural, the open, the spontaneous. And Miller was more than simply an entertainer: he had that uncanny knack of commanding attention without apparently ever seeking it. </p> <p>In Australia, Miller is also an historical embodiment. Just as Bradman is often seen as sporting solace of the Great Depression, Miller is associated immediately with the second world war, the warrior who beat his sword into a bat rather than a ploughshare. </p> <p><strong> Defining experience</strong><br> </p> <p> A sense of destiny infests his name: Keith Ross Miller was christened as a tribute to the aviators Keith and Ross Smith, who in the week of his birth landed in Melbourne after a pioneering trip from England. And certainly, in reversing their journey at the outbreak of war as a pilot officer in the Royal Australian Air Force, Miller underwent what there is little doubt was his defining life experience. </p> <p>In his book Cricket Crossfire, Miller gives his war years 10 pages that read at first light-heartedly. Then you notice, dropped in laconically, phrases such as \"who later in the war was killed\", \"he crashed and was killed\", and \"six or seven of my pals had been killed\". He tells of walking away from a crash-landing with the advice: \"Nearly stumps drawn that time, gents.\" If his cricket had an air of insouciance in the face of danger, there is little wondering why. </p> <p>His first big cricket ensued, in fact, in the so-called Victory Tests of the English summer of 1945, where he capped off leading the batting averages with an innings of 185 for Dominions, led by Learie Constantine, against England, led by Walter Hammond. </p> <p>In this extraordinary three-day match of 1,241 runs, Miller's first 61, scored in the last 75 minutes of the second day, included one six on to the top tier of the pavilion. He followed it, on the third morning, with what Pelham Warner reckoned the greatest exhibition of hitting he saw in 60 years as a player and potentate. In 90 minutes of mostly orthodox but startlingly powerful batting, Miller added 124, with six further sixes: one carried to Block Q on the right of the pavilion; another landed on the roof of the broadcasting box, falling into a shrapnel hole in the roof, from which it had to be dislodged with a stick. </p> <p>The story goes that Miller's hitting was so violent that elderly MCC members abandoned their favourite positions and adjourned to the bar, where it was safer, though this may be fond Australian imagining. In any event, Lord's became a venue that he cherished as much as it cherished him: he made a fine Test hundred there in 1953, and harvested 10 wickets three years later. </p> <p>No appreciation of Miller, though, should be burdened with too much enumeration of facts. It just wasn't him. Just about every Australian can tell you Bradman's batting average; only a real aficionado can be exact about Miller's statistics. He simply stood out. In an era when cricketers did not routinely resemble athletes, he assuredly did. In an age when cricketers were not famed for being photogenic, the camera loved him, almost to distraction. </p> <p>Cricket, too, was the game he played during the day. He did not care to think about it too deeply in hindsight. A journalist once accosted him wanting to know how he had just taken seven for 12 in a Sheffield Shield match against South Australia. \"There's three reasons,\" Miller replied. \"First, I bowled bloody well. Second, I, errr ... second ...\" There was a pause. \"You can forget about the other two reasons.\" </p> <p>And make no mistake: Miller had \"it\". Presence, charisma, an aura - call it what you will. It was said that men wanted to be like him, women simply to be with him. He was thankful in later life that the media had in his own time been a relatively tactful institution. </p> <p>Over lunch in Sydney one day, a mutual friend opined that Miller would have been worth millions to the modern game and been paid accordingly. When I asked Keith if he would have wanted it that way, simply to play cricket, he looked askance. \"You know,\" he said, \"Bill O'Reilly said to me just before he died: 'Keith, we were lucky to play cricket when we did.' He didn't have to say anything else. I knew exactly what he meant.\" </p> <p>I have one particularly vivid recollection of that meeting, for I did something I seldom do, and asked Miller for his autograph - to sign a copy, as it happens, of that same photograph that had hung in Menzies's office. The mutual friend laughed, not without reason, that a park-cricket plodder such as I should feel an affinity with such an image. </p> <p>Only after returning home did I peep at Keith's dedication. It reads: \"Good shot this. Try it some time.\" Perhaps it explains something about Miller's personality that just contemplating him makes me think I ought to. </p> <p><strong>Nugget and diamonds</strong> The greatest all-rounders</p> <p>Tests | runs | bat ave | wkts | bwl ave </p> <p> Garry Sobers 93 | 8032 | 57.78 | 235 | 34.03 </p> <p>Imran Khan 88 | 3807 | 37.69 | 362 | 22.81 </p> <p><strong> Keith Miller 55 | 2958 | 36.97 | 170 | 22.97</strong> </p> <p>Ian Botham 102 | 5200 | 33.54 | 383 | 28.40 </p> <p>Wilfred Rhodes 58 | 2325 | 30.19 | 127 | 26.96</p>",
  "Australia and Afghanistan don't have much in common, other than a vast, arid interior. But as voters in both countries cast their ballots over the weekend, their respective elections will have had an impact on political landscapes around the world. In the case of Afghanistan, the very fact of its holding democratic presidential elections is the most optimistic sign to come from that country for some time. Despite last-minute turmoil when 15 presidential rivals to the interim president, Hamid Karzai, called for a boycott over possible voting fraud, election observers declared the election to be fairly conducted. The sight of long queues patiently waiting outside polling stations on Saturday is some vindication of the international efforts to reconstruct Afghanistan, as is the absence of serious reprisals and violent attempts at disruption that had been threatened by supporters of the Taliban. <p>The long queues in Australia, meanwhile, were more a reflection of the country's legal requirement on its citizens to vote than a celebration of the flowering of democracy. John Howard's victory as leader of Australia's conservative coalition was a surprisingly strong one, after opinion polls had predicted a tight race. Instead, Mr Howard's coalition increased its majority in the lower house of parliament and looks likely to take control of the senate, making it the first time in 20 years that a government has dominated both houses. This will allow Mr Howard to push through unpopular measures on employment deregulation and loosening the country's media ownership laws in favour of global goliaths such as Rupert Murdoch's News International. </p> <p>Mr Howard's victory will be closely studied by the incumbents in Downing Street and Pennsylvania Avenue. Mr Howard and his government had been a staunch member of the \"coalition of the willing\" that invaded Iraq last year, with Australia having 850 troops on the ground. The Labor opposition had boldly pledged to withdraw them by the end of the year, capitalising on winning support from those opposed to the war. But it is Australia's strong economy, with low unemployment and rising house prices, that appears to have had a greater influence on the election outcome. </p> <p>From the perspective of Tony Blair, the result is encouraging, a reminder that voters will choose domestic priorities over international affairs. The latest set of opinion polls bears this out, with Labour widening its lead over the Conservatives. Mr Blair's opponents would be unwise to rely on using Iraq as the sole fulcrum to lever him out of office.</p>",
  "Let me say this off the top - nothing has irritated me more than the infatuation in the media with things that happened more than 30 years ago. It seems the Baby Boomers still can't let go of Vietnam. <p> I was born in 1966, I was age seven when the main group of troops left, nine when Saigon fell. I don't much care what either candidate did at that time, it tells me very little about what they will do now. </p> <p> To this point, I stand pretty much where I stood a few months ago. I am a bit right of centre, and while I have some problems with GW Bush, there is nothing about John Kerry that appeals to me. It isn't really the supposed flip-flop thing, either. </p> <p> Kerry's message, aside from Iraq, is fairly clear. But I don't think rolling back the tax cut is a good idea (and I don't trust him to limit the rollback to the 'rich'), and while I don't think Bush has done a good job in controlling government spending, I see no evidence Kerry would do any better. </p> <p> I have paid fairly close attention in fits and starts, drifting away at times during the summer, but there's been little in this campaign to sway me. </p> <p>Perhaps I am more set in my ways than I wish to admit. </p> <p>Butch Kamena<br> Bellingham, Washington State</p>",
  "<p>It is a tragic irony that, in his life and death, Christopher Reeve, who has died of heart failure aged 52, has been renowned for two roles: Superman, the supreme physical specimen, and a man paralysed from the neck down. Unfortunately, the second role was all too real.</p> <p>In 1995 Reeve, a keen rider, broke his neck when he was thrown from his horse during an equestrian competition in Virginia. But, after some years of therapy, despite pessimistic prognoses, he was determined to walk again, and became a symbol of hope for quadriplegics. \"I refuse to allow a disability to determine how I live my life. I don't mean to be reckless, but setting a goal that seems a bit daunting actually is very helpful toward recovery,\" Reeve said.</p> <p>In 2000, Reeve was able to move his index finger and breathe for longer and longer periods without a respirator. He also regained sensation in other parts of his body. Reeve dedicated much of his time and almost all of his energy lobbying US Congress for better insurance protection against catastrophic injury and giving support to stem cell research. Coincidentally, Senator John Kerry, in Friday's debate with George Bush, said that he believed embryonic stem cell research should be expanded, saying it would be the best way to give Reeve (an active Democrat) and others like him the chance to walk again. </p> <p>However, it would be a pity if this heroic and heartrending situation should obscure some of his many achievements in his acting career, cut short in such a cruel manner. After all, Reeve appeared in a total of 17 feature films, a dozen TV movies, and about 150 plays. </p> <p>Christopher Reeve was born in New York into an intellectual family; his father FD Reeve is a noted novelist, poet, and scholar of Russian literature; his mother, the journalist Barbara Johnson. During his childhood, Christopher was exposed to a stimulating intellectual environment that included Sunday dinners with the poets Robert Frost and Robert Penn Warren, and politician and academic Daniel Patrick Moynihan. The atmosphere was such that his father was disappointed to learn that the role of Superman that his son had been offered was not one in George Bernard Shaw's Man and Superman as he had thought. </p> <p>Christopher attended the exclusive Princeton Day School, where he started acting in plays. \"While I was growing up,\" Reeve recalled, \"I never once asked myself: 'Who am I?' or 'What am I doing?' Right from the beginning, the theatre was like home to me. It seemed to be what I did best. I never doubted that I belonged in it.\" After graduating from high school, Reeve toured the country as Celeste Holm's leading man in The Irregular Verb To Love. </p> <p>While at Cornell University, he majored in music theory and English, and spent time studying theatre in Britain and France. In London, he worked at the Old Vic. \"I was a glorified errand boy, but it was a very exciting time there. I helped by teaching the British actors to speak with an American accent. Then I went to Paris to work with the Comedie Francaise.\"</p> <p>In lieu of his final year at Cornell, Reeve was one of two students (Robin Williams was the other) who were accepted at New York's Juilliard School of Performing Arts. There he studied under the celebrated John Houseman. At the same time, he supported himself with a role in the long-running television soap, Love Of Life. Reeve's almost unreal handsome looks and athletic, six-foot-four frame made him perfect material for a soap-opera hero, as later for a comic-book one. In the meantime, he won a coveted role of Katharine Hepburn's grandson in Enid Bagnold's A Matter Of Gravity on Broadway in 1976, of which Reeve commented: \"I had the privilege of spending nine months working with one of the masters of the craft.\" In the same year, Reeve got a small part in Gray Lady Down, a submarine adventure film. </p> <p>While appearing in an off-Broadway production, Reeve successfully screen-tested for the 1978 movie Superman. It was the most inspired casting of an unknown in a series since Sean Connery's James Bond. Reeve portrayed Superman as \"somebody that, you know, you can invite home for dinner ... What makes Superman a hero is not that he has power, but that he has the wisdom and the maturity to use the power wisely. From an acting point of view, that's how I approached the part.\" Of playing Clark Kent, Reeve reckoned that \"there must be some difference stylistically between Clark and Superman. Otherwise you just have a pair of glasses standing in for a character.\" Reeve, though he played the two roles straight without any sign of camp, revealed a deft Cary Grant-inspired comic timing.</p> <p>Unfortunately, the three sequels were a matter of diminishing returns and, after Superman IV: The Quest For Peace (1987), Reeve, determined to 'escape the cape', explained: \"Look, I've flown, I've become evil, loved, stopped and turned the world backward, I've faced my peers, I've befriended children and small animals and I've rescued cats from trees. What else is there left for Superman to do that hasn't been done?\" </p> <p>Away from the man of steel, Reeve portrayed a wide range of roles. His films included the love fantasy, Somewhere In Time (1980); the thriller Deathtrap (1982); Monsignor (1982), in which he again wore a cape in the title role; and two archetypal Merchant-Ivory period pieces, The Bostonians (1984) and The Remains Of The Day (1993). He also showed his ability at farce in Switching Channels (1988) and Noises Off (1992). Further proof of his versatility came on stage in The Aspern Papers in London with Vanessa Redgrave and Dame Wendy Hiller; Beaumarchais' The Marriage Of Figaro in New York, and Tennessee Williams's Summer And Smoke in Los Angeles, as well as touring in Love Letters. </p> <p>Before the near-fatal accident, Reeve seemed to have everything. He was an accomplished pianist and a superb athlete. He earned his pilot's licence in his early 20s and twice flew solo across the Atlantic in a small plane. He also flew gliders and was an expert sailor, scuba diver and skier. But horses were his great passion. </p> <p>In 1998, Reeve returned to acting in a remarkable TV movie update of the Hitchcock thriller Rear Window, in which a man confined to a wheelchair spies on people in a neighbouring apartment.</p> <p>Reeve is survived by three children, a son and daughter from his long relationship with modelling executive Gae Exton, and a son with Dana Morosini, whom he married in 1992. Reeve's parents are still alive. </p> <p>\u00cb Christopher Reeve, actor, born September 25 1952; died October 10 2004</p>",
  "From a distance, the people standing around a town square table in red jackets look like a marketing team giving away free orange juice, but get a little closer and it is clear that they are pushing a quite different product. The mixed-race, mixed-age team are political activists who represent the great unknown quantity in next month's presidential election: the 527s. <p>The catchy umbrella title refers to the tax code for a group of organisations that has mainly come into being since campaign finance law made it illegal two years ago for parties to accept large contributions from corporations, unions or individuals. </p> <p>What it means on the ground in the swing states that will decide the presidency is impossible to judge now; what is clear is that they have already changed the character of the race and will continue to do so until November 2. </p> <p>The red jackets standing around in the main square of Wilkes-Barre, in eastern Pennsylvania, are from <a href=\" http://www.act4victory.org \" target=\"_new\"> America Coming Together</a>, a multimillion-dollar donor network with offices in 17 states. Technically, the organisation is non-partisan, but it is openly dedicated to overthrowing the Bush administration. </p> <p>The orange juice is just a way of illustrating one criticism: that the last two rounds of tax cuts have squeezed the middle class, which is now left with a huge deficit to pay off while the rich enjoy a windfall. </p> <p>This is campaigning in all but name. The obvious beneficiary of the group's imaginative public awareness exercise is the Kerry-Edwards campaign - but 527 status means that any coordination with political parties is strictly prohibited. </p> <p>\"We're not selling a candidate; we're selling issues - educating people and mobilising them,\" says Sean Carr, ACT's press spokesman, based in nearby Allentown. He adds: \"When I've asked a lot of people why they never got involved in politics before they just say, 'Well, no one ever asked me.'\"</p> <p>Mr Carr, a New Jersey resident, left \"a government job, my fiancee and my dog\" to get involved full time at the beginning of the summer. Like the other activists I met, most of whom were trade unionists sporting ACT jackets and talking of regime change, he is being paid.</p> <p>After the election Tyrek Lee, 27, will be going back to his job in Boston, where he has three kids waiting for him. \"This is for their future,\" he told me. \"These 30 days here are worth it for them and for the rest of America.\" </p> <p>I asked several of the ACT staffers which way they would be voting, which induced a serious bout of squirming. \"I don't talk about my individual vote,\" said Mr Carr, adding: \"When we give people the facts on the issues, I think they will vote in a good way.\" </p> <p>Sympathetic visitors to the Middle-Class Squeeze orange juice stand were also asked to give a name and phone number to help get the vote out on election day. ACT replaces the usual party rhetoric of \"Vote for me\" with pocket-sized leaflets stating: \"Take the pledge! Your vote makes the difference.\" </p> <p>Wilkes-Barre voters who were prepared to engage in conversation with the ACT team were generally sympathetic to the Kerry cause. Ironically, the rather dilapidated square where we stood had been encircled with plastic barriers in preparation for a presidential campaign stop the following day. </p> <p>George Barron, a Democrat-supporting attorney who passed by, said he had profoundly mixed feelings about the 527 phenomenon: \"The unfortunate thing on both sides is that they have been more negative and less responsible than the candidates themselves.\" </p> <p>He said the advertising end of the 527 operation, led in oppositional terms by <a href=\" http://www.moveon.org/front/\" target=\"_new\"> MoveOn.org</a> had encouraged a new \"nastiness\".</p> <p>\"As long as the <a href=\"http://www.swiftvets.com \" target=\"_new\"> Swift Boat Veterans for Truth</a> are out there making noise we need folks on the other side doing the same .\"</p> <p>But he added: \"I would like to think after this election these 527s will be eliminated, because it defeats the entire purpose of campaign reform.\"</p> <p>Progressive 527s may truly have had no contact whatsoever with Democratic strategy chiefs - or enraged swift boat vets with the Bush campaign - yet their positioning has been complementary. They have spent money and attacked with advertising in places where the party could not go. In Pennsylvania, the voting registration deadline was last Monday, and early indications are that tens of thousands more people have signed up than did in 2000. </p> <p>ACT's office in the classic swing voter territory of the Lehigh Valley provides some insight into why the political party establishment is viewing the 527 ground operation as a force to be reckoned with. </p> <p>The network of rooms at the back of a shabby local hotel has all the feel of a local campaign headquarters in full swing, without the obligatory stack of candidates' biographies and smiling posters. </p> <p>The field director in charge, Siobhan \"Sam\" Bennett, 47, is almost messianic about her task and the youthful team around her. She is a registered Democrat who ran for city mayor four years ago, losing by a few dozen votes to a seasoned Republican incumbent. </p> <p>She sees no contradiction in shelving her party connections for an operation that serves both her causes well. \"This is an important region on the ground floor in terms of making sure that everyone who should be registered is registered and making sure that everyone votes,\" she said. </p> <p>\"How can we remain healthy as a nation, irrespective of party, if people are not engaged in the political process? Declining voter participation is terribly damaging to our long-term health.\" </p> <p>Her idealistic and genuine hope is that ACT will make more people take part, and she goes a great deal further in transcending the party political prism than does the organisation's own website. She used to vote Republican until the Clinton era: \"At the door, we don't ever mention George's name here when we work. What's important to me are the issues,\" she says.</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, local Republican officials do not recognise the civic-mindedness of the ACT and MoveOn agenda: \"They are shadowy groups funded by unregulated, soft money,\" said Mark Pfeifle, a media spokesman for the Bush campaign in Pennsylvania, who clearly sees the 527s as an electoral threat. </p> <p>\"Our grassroots operation has been empowered and excited by them. We have an army of volunteers who have made more than one million phone contacts; they, on the other hand, are paying people to come in from out of state.\" </p> <p>ACT has attracted thousands of volunteers of its own to help the huge doorstep operation in cities like Allentown. Many of them have indeed come by bus for the day or for the weekend from places such as nearby New York. Plenty of their volunteers are also locally based, say officials. </p> <p>One thing that both ACT and the state's Bush-Cheney campaign would agree on is that there is no way of properly judging the 527 effect until election day itself, although the local polling evidence is looking good for the anti-Bush lobby. </p> <p>Chris Borick, director of the public opinion institute at Muhlenberg college in Allentown, said that after being tied in the spring Kerry this week had a 6% edge over Bush among registered voters in the Lehigh Valley area. </p> <p>\"The 527s' presence is being clearly felt in local grassroots politics,\" he said. \"They are, by design, supposed to be unaffiliated with the campaigns, but by their very nature then go hand in hand ... While legally bound to be separate, in reality they are intertwined.\" </p> <p>With relatively small numbers of swing voters remaining, the decisive factor may be simply getting out the vote, he said: \"Something I'm not sure we are truly picking up in the way we model our polling numbers is greater-than-expected turnout. These groups could tip the balance in terms of mobilisation.</p> <p>\"When we look back at the book of the 2004 election, I am anticipating that 527s will be a fairly substantial chapter.\"</p>",
  "Read the media and you'll be aware of a momentous political event taking place some way east of California. Over on the other coast something called the 2004 presidential election is happening. Swing voters are being courted, canvassers are knocking on doors, and suspicious-sounding 527 committees are piling money into local TV commercials. But out here on the west coast, where people are as passionate about their politics as anywhere else, the whole thing seems like a phoney war. Sure, there are petitioners on street corners and leafleters at farmers' markets, but where oh where are the real politicians? California needs to see more of middle-aged men kissing babies, it needs to see more secret servicemen wearing mirror shades, it needs more senseless ticketed photo ops dressed up as political rallies. <p>True, Bush and Kerry both visited Los Angeles in the summer, indeed in the same week, and they both put in an appearance in the spring, going to their rich friends' houses to ask for money. But compared to four years ago the attention paid to the nation's most populous state, the state with the largest economy in the union, the state that has given most money to the presidential candidates, has been pitiful. </p> <p>Four years ago, California was the centre of things presidential as the Democrats held their convention in Los Angeles. The candidates swung through the state, they even had their photo taken with the governor. But this time, no one is coming to the party. </p> <p>The main reason is that, without a convention to go to, national candidates figure that there is little to be gained from the long trek to the west coast. Californian voters, polling wisdom tells us, have made up their minds, and their minds are firmly Democrat. So the Kerry-Edwards team stays away, not wanting to waste money on the converted, while the Bush-Cheney camp prefers to focus on the swing states. After all, it's a long way from Florida to California. </p> <p>But California, according to the latest polls, is slightly more complicated than they imagine. For a start, the state mirrors the nation. The coast is liberal, the interior more conservative. The further you travel from the Pacific, the more Republican the voters become. Californians also tend to be classic third way voters, sticking to neither liberal nor conservative orthodoxies: they are liberal on social issues, such as gun control, abortion, the environment, but are fiscal conservatives, preferring deregulation, low taxes and small government.</p> <p>If you were to try to embody this confused political philosophy in one person, that figure might look something like Californian governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. His recent flurry of decisions on bills passed by the state's legilsature have revealed him to be, well, unexpectedly liberal on some social issues - he is a Republican, after all - and convincingly conservative on others. So he has approved the distribution of clean hypodermic needles to people without prescription, toughened gun control and strengthened the rights of same-sex couples. But his conservative side has vetoed legislation promising an increase in the minimum wage, granting driving licences to undocumented immigrants and extending health insurance to cover maternity. Schwarzenegger has passed all of the tests set for him by the state's chamber of commerce, opposing all the legislation the chamber opposed and proving himself to be a reliable friend of car dealers, the pharmaceutical industry and big business in general.</p> <p>Of course, Governor Schwarzenegger is one explanation for the absence of the big players from California. His star wattage remains undimmed, despite the various political setbacks he has endured during the first 11 months of his mandate. No national politician in his right mind would be tempted by the prospect of sharing Arnold's spotlight in California. </p> <p>But Schwarzenegger is also one reason why it might make sense for the national players to come to California. His liberal credentials have earned him widespread support among Democrats and, if the state were ever to sway toward the Republicans, this might be the time. Recent polling suggests that the state may not be the shoo-in Democrats have for so long assumed. Three polls published in the last week send the sort of mixed message that can make George Bush so snippy. The Field Poll has Kerry leading Bush by 49-40, down from 53-41 in August, which in turn was down from a Kerry lead of 55-40 in May. But a survey by San Jose State University has Kerry ahead by just six points, at 48-42, down from his lead of 50-28 in July. And, just to confuse matters, the latest Rasmussen survey, covering the week to October 4, has Kerry ahead 53-40. </p> <p>Of course what will actually happen on November 2 is that John Kerry will win California, taking all its 55 electoral college votes with him and bearing out the decisions of the two campaigns not to bother with the state. Hopefully that result will lend weight to calls for reform of the winner-takes-all formula governing the presidential election. But don't hold your breath.</p>",
  "<p>The Nobel laureate James Watson, who co-discovered the structure of DNA, today defended stem cell research saying scientists must be able to search for ways to improve the quality of life. </p> <p>Speaking at the opening of a new exhibit on his life and work in Berlin, Dr Watson said: \"There's a perception that scientists are more interested in science than society, that scientists are less moral than religious people. I think that's completely wrong. To what extent research on stem cells will improve the quality of human life, I don't know, but we should be allowed to try.\" </p> <p>Embryonic stem cells are master cells that form during the early days after conception, and can turn into any tissue in the body. Many scientists hope to harness them to grow replacement tissue to treat spinal cord injuries, as well as diabetes and other diseases. </p> <p>But the research is controversial because a human embryo must be destroyed to gather new stem cells.</p> <p>Following pressure from anti-abortion groups, the US president, George Bush, has limited federal funding of embryonic stem cell research to only the 78 stem cell lines in existence before August 2001. </p> <p>Many high-profile campaigners are pushing for the ban to be lifted. The actor Christopher Reeve, who died today, was an active supporter of stem cell research. The star of four Superman films was paralysed from the shoulders down in a horse-riding accident in 1995. After his accident, Reeve campaigned for the stem cell ban to be lifted; a move that would allow a portion of the US National Institute of Health's vast budget to be spent on developing the technique. </p> <p>Nancy Reagan is also well known for her support of stem cell technologies, which may have implications for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease - the condition from which her husband, the former US president Ronald Reagan, died earlier this year. </p> <p>Speaking at a dinner for diabetes research in May, Mrs Reagan said she believed stem cell research \"may provide our scientists with many answers that for so long have been beyond our grasp\". </p> <p>The presidential candidate John Kerry has pledged to remove the ban on stem cell research if elected to office next month.</p> <p>Dr Watson, an American, was 24 when he and the British-born Francis Crick struck upon the idea that the DNA molecule resembled a twisted ladder, or \"double helix\", while working at the University of Cambridge's Cavendish Laboratory in 1953. The pair were awarded the Nobel prize for medicine in 1962.</p> <p>Since then, Dr Watson has written several books and is now working on an autobiography, Manners for Science. The Berlin exhibit features articles about Dr Watson and selections from his work and personal history.</p>",
  "It's been a week of conferences and comment, of political promises (from Labour) and promises not to make promises (from the Conservatives). <p>It's easy to make jokes about the Conservative party - collectively and individually, seriously or just plain spitefully. Watching Oliver Letwin's on-stage flailing was acutely painful - his wild eyes and heart-wrenching optimism had the air of an unpopular adolescent, desperate for someone to sit next to him on the school bus. </p> <p>But what of the content behind the disastrous body language? To give credit where it's due, the Conservatives' \"Timetable for Action\" contains some irrefutably sensible policies. Who doesn't want cleaner hospitals? But it doesn't take a PhD in political strategy to identify some major, and avoidable, errors in Howard's first conference as leader. </p> <p>1. Don't tell would-be voters that politicians routinely break promises - we know that. <br> 2. If you are going to, don't remind them of all the promises your own party has already broken. <br> 3. If you absolutely have to do that, don't make the same promises again in the same breath.</p> <p>The big problem for the Tories - and one they're still barely acknowledging, let alone tackling - is that a natural Conservative already lives at No 10. He just doesn't lead them. </p> <p>When Tony Blair became Labour leader, he stole the Conservatives' greatest asset: pragmatism. He has taken over all their sensible policies and introduced some (like the disastrous PFI initiatives) which even Margaret Thatcher wouldn't have attempted. With his maniacal self-belief, his unshakeable allegiance to the most rightwing president America has ever had and his advocacy of pre-emptive conflict, he is a truer heir to Thatcher than Michael Howard will ever be.</p> <p>Don't be persuaded, though, by his vow to complete a full third term. You don't spend \u00a33.6m on a house at the peak of the nation's longest housing boom if you don't intend to live in it for 5 or 6 years. </p> <p>If the Conservatives hadn't foolishly backed the war in Iraq, they would be able to capitalise on the fact that Blair is now Labour's biggest electoral liability. The party's undoubted achievements - investment in education and health, a sustained period of economic growth - owe more to the chancellor's policies and passions than to the self-aggrandisement of the Dear Leader. For all the standing ovations, I suspect that Labour's conference delegates know this too, though their long years in the opposition wilderness have left them too disciplined to say so publicly. </p> <p>There's no doubt that Tony Blair is a brilliant politician. But being a brilliant politician does not make you a brilliant prime minister - and it was the dishonesty behind the gloss of his polished conference speech that will give natural Labour supporters serious pause for thought. </p> <p>In the run-up to the election, many of them will be asking how you can fight a war in the name of freedom when you advocate trial without jury (albeit only in \"certain cases\")? The linguistic finesse of his nod to anti-war delegates - \"I can apologise for the information that turned out to be wrong\" - won't fool anyone who was actually awake in the run-up to the war and who has followed the subsequent (strictly limited) inquiries into it. </p> <p>It's not that the intelligence was \"wrong\". The intelligence Blair saw was full of carefully worded caveats. What the prime minister should apologise for (and so far he's only admitted that he could apologise) is his shameless hyping of a vague threat and his refusal to clarify things when newspapers began warning us that we could be nuked in 45 minutes. </p> <p>In short, he should apologise for precisely the qualities that make him a brilliant politician: a genius for manipulation, obfuscation, and getting his own way.</p> <p>If Michael Howard is to make any serious headway against Labour, he cannot simply attempt to reclaim the traditional Tory policies (more police, more choice) that are already in Labour's manifesto. He is going to have to admit that, like many in this country, he was duped by Blair's rhetoric and was wrong about the war. Only by so doing can he position himself for the full frontal attack he must mount.</p> <p>It's a good job he's in confessional mood.</p>",
  "George Bush has long been lampooned by opponents as a puppet for the real brains in the White House. After his first presidential debate with John Kerry, internet bulletin boards have been hosting a growing clamour of rumours that they finally have the proof. <p>A photograph from the Associated Press, taken of the president from behind, appears to show a small bulge under his jacket between the shoulder blades, sparking speculation that he was being coached through a wire. </p> <p>Those contributing to bulletin boards have noted that at one point in the debate, Mr Bush said: \"Let me finish,\" even though nobody had been heard to interrupt him - a riposte, perhaps, to the voice in his ear. </p> <p>Others note numerous pauses during Mr Bush's answers. David Lindorff wrote on Salon.com: \"On several occasions, the president simply stopped speaking for an uncomfortably long time and stared ahead with an odd expression on his face. </p> <p>\"Was he listening to someone helping him with his response to a question?\" </p> <p>But one contributor to the Blue Lemur messageboard wrote: \"The 'let me finish' line - Bush saying some thing in the middle of a sentence that makes no sense is nothing new; he does it all the time ... As for his 'dramatic pauses', I assume this [was] put in as a joke. Bush can never finish a sentence without stopping and trying to remember what he was talking about.\" </p> <p>The White House refused to comment on the rumours, and the Bush campaign laughed them off. A spokesman, Scott Stanzel, said: \"Some people have been spending too many hours looking at leftwing conspiracy websites. Did you hear the one about Elvis moderating the third debate?\" </p> <p>Mr Bush's tailor, Georges de Paris, has also dismissed the claim. </p> <p>He told reporters at the weekend that the bulge was nothing more than a pucker along the jacket's seam when the president crossed his arms and leaned forward.</p>",

  "I switched on News24 last week to find a gangly 51-year-old giving evidence to a Senate committee in Washington. I realised I was watching Charles Duelfer, who had just published the Iraq Survey Group's report into Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. His evidence brought home to me the moribund state of democracy in Britain. <p>Like all WMD anoraks (especially those of us who had initially been persuaded to support the war), I could recite the prime minister's words in the September 2002 intelligence dossier by heart. \"Intelligence has established beyond doubt that Saddam has continued to produce chemical and biological weapons, that he continues to develop nuclear weapons ... some of these weapons can be ready for use in 45 minutes ... the threat is serious and current.\" We were 45 minutes from doom. Remember? </p> <p>Duelfer's conclusions definitively buried that dossier. Saddam Hussein had ended his nuclear programme and destroyed his chemical and biological weapons stocks more than a decade ago. We may have been 45 minutes from doom. But that was in 1991. </p> <p>Duelfer had the courage to state this with clarity. Remarkably, his report was commissioned by an agency of the US government itself - the CIA under George Tenet, who, with his subsequent resignation, effectively took personal responsibility for the pre-war intelligence mistakes. Contrast here the behaviour of John Scarlett in Britain. </p> <p>The Senate's examination of the Duelfer report was a model of serious democratic debate. John Kerry has now staked out a clear alternative point of view on Iraq, and there have been three hours of head-on Bush-Kerry television debate in the past week. So the US election is, among other things, a plebiscite on the Iraq issue. If the American people choose to re-elect their president, we are at liberty to disagree with their verdict, but at least democracy will have spoken. </p> <p>Those who wrote the US constitution were obsessed with checks and balances. Their handiwork remains intact today. And how sharp the contrast is between America, and Britain. Where are the checks and balances constraining Blair, the ability to hold him to account? </p> <p>I have been searching in vain. Compare Duelfer's rigour and honesty with that of his British equivalents, Lords Hutton and Butler. Of the inept former, enough has been said. For the latter, I have much more time. I suspect, though, that Robin Butler was constrained by others on his committee, and in the end they bottled out of assigning responsibility, having published more than enough evidence to show that there had been political interference in the intelligence dossier. No 10 ended up controlling both of these supposedly independent inquiries. </p> <p>What about parliament? The select committees, compared with those in Washington, were an abject failure. Entirely controlled by the power of No 10's patronage, the chairman of the culture committee, Gerald Kaufman, sent the BBC a letter of complaint about its war coverage that was drafted verbatim for him by none other than Alastair Campbell. And the foreign affairs committee was so eager to humiliate Andrew Gilligan that it forgot to get the truth out of David Kelly when it had the chance. As a source of genuine scrutiny of the executive, this is just ridiculous. </p> <p>Even more troublingly, our electoral system seems incapable of holding No 10 to account. Regrettably, the Conservatives have been so hamstrung by their original support for the war that they have been unable to land a single telling blow in 2004, despite being let loose in a veritable candy store of political opportunity. The Liberal Democrats have done better, but given the expected low turnout next year, Blair's tendency could get the support of less than 25% of the electorate and still win a large Commons majority. </p> <p>So I reluctantly conclude that there is but one part of our democratic process that is in robust working order. And that is the press. The Daily Mail, the Independent, the Guardian and the television news services have all pursued the Iraq issue like a pack of rottweilers gnawing at one gigantic bone. </p> <p>Increasingly hated by the government, the press has been accused of trivialising politics and breeding mistrust of our leaders. To some extent that is true, but the attacks by Campbell on the BBC last year mostly reflected the pent-up frustration that the fourth estate was the one remaining estate of the realm that would not dance to his tune. </p> <p>Far from being the weak link in our democratic chain, hard-bitten and stubborn journalists have almost single-handedly forced the government to account for its actions over the past two years. We should all be grateful that they are still around. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Gavyn Davies was chairman of the BBC from 2001-2004. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:gavyn.davies@fulcrumasset.com\">gavyn.davies@fulcrumasset.com</a></p>",
  "An opposition boycott of Afghanistan's presidential election appeared to be cracking yesterday as local and international observers declared the vote prone to blunders but generally fair. <p>Mohammed Mohaqeq, a high profile challenger to the interim president, Hamid Karzai, said he no longer supported the boycott announced on Saturday by all 15 opposition candidates, who claimed there had been widespread voter fraud. </p> <p>\"There is no question of a boycott,\" he told about 1,000 supporters at a mosque in western Kabul. </p> <p>The US ambassador, Zalmay Khalilzad, shuttled between other candidates to persuade them to follow Mr Mohaqeq's example as the counting of the votes started in eight tightly guarded centres. </p> <p>Another candidate, Abdul Hadi Dabir, said some had already changed their minds. </p> <p>Meanwhile, a joint UN-Afghan election body announced an independent inquiry into claims of fraud. </p> <p>The controversy marred an otherwise peaceful election that saw millions of Afghans participate in what they hoped would end a quarter of a century of violent chaos. </p> <p>In an initial assessment, the Free and Fair Election Foundation of Afghanistan (Fefa) said that despite many errors and some deliberate rigging the poll was largely successful. The Organisation for Security and Cooperation of Europe, which deployed 40 experts, gave a similar verdict. </p> <p>The fraud allegations emerged after just a few hours of polling, when voters complained that what was supposed to be indelible ink, used to prevent multiple voting, could be easily rubbed off. </p> <p>Naseem, a hotel waiter in Kabul, held out a spotlessly clean hand that he said had been inked at a polling station an hour earlier. \"I just washed it away,\" he said. </p> <p>The scale of the problem remained unclear yesterday. UN officials blamed inexperienced election workers, who had used the wrong ink. But observers said the organisers were also at fault because some of the correct ink had dried up or was not indelible. </p> <p>Fefa called for an investigation into the irregularities, which also included allegations that some poll workers directed voters how to vote. </p> <p>The election marked a setback for the Taliban, which managed just a few skirmishes and landmine attacks on polling days. \"The Taliban made very limited attacks,\" the US commander, Lt Gen David Barno, told Associated Press. \"Yesterday was a huge defeat for the Taliban.\" </p> <p>The insurgent force had issued warnings of bombings, beatings and rocket attacks. But millions of Afghans were undeterred, flooding into bullet-pocked schools, mosques and clinics to cast their ballot. </p> <p>One official with the peacekeeping force said a line of voters had had to scatter after a rocket exploded in Jalalabad. But after a few moments, they had returned to the queue and voted. </p> <p>Some voters saw the opposition boycott as a ploy by poor losers. \"This was like an exam for them, and they have failed,\" said Saleh Muhammad, 64, a shopkeeper in western Kabul. He said he kept a Mohaqeq poster in his window to avoid harassment, but had voted for Mr Karzai. </p> <p>First figures were due late last night, but a spokesman said a result might take another week. </p>",
  "The contest for the White House was locked in a dead heat yesterday, with Republican and Democratic strategists looking to the third and last debate to score the convincing victory that could alter the dynamics of the race. <p>With just three weeks until voting day, the gap between George Bush and John Kerry has narrowed significantly. </p> <p>An ABC television poll conducted after Friday night's debate in Missouri and released yesterday put Mr Bush marginally ahead with 50% support compared with 46% for Mr Kerry, but still within the margins of error. </p> <p>That tightening of the race elevates the importance of Wednesday's debate in Arizona as the last, best chance for either candidate to take a decisive lead. </p> <p>With that debate, the focus of the campaigns shifts from Iraq to domestic issues, where the Democrats believe they have an advantage. </p> <p>\"We have to, number one, focus on making sure the American people know what's happened over the last four years,\" the vice-presidential candidate, John Edwards, said yesterday morning in one of several appearances on the weekend chatshows. </p> <p>Mr Edwards said Mr Bush had presided over historic job losses and a worsening economy, charges the Democrats plan to amplify in the run-up to the debate. </p> <p>Although two instant polls crowned Mr Kerry the winner of Friday night's clash in Missouri, the victory was not so decisive as to reverse the Republicans' overall edge. </p> <p>For his part Mr Bush was far more in command of his material than during his dismal performance in the first debate, and he held his temper largely in check, replacing the angry scowls with a studiously blank expression. </p> <p>The Democratic pollster Stanley Greenberg said Mr Kerry had improved his \"likeability quotient\", especially among uncommitted voters. \"He clearly established a sense of confidence and likeability and made possible these gains in personal favourability which, I believe, will translate into vote changes during the next week,\" the pollster said. </p> <p>Now that the Democratic candidate has established a presidential demeanour with his two solid debate performances, he must work to convince the American people that he shares their concerns about jobs and healthcare. \"We are going to find that John Kerry is a fighter for the middle classes,\" said Joe Lockhart, a senior campaign adviser. </p> <p>Mr Kerry, meanwhile, picked up on one of the most pointed exchanges of Friday night, when Mr Bush refused to answer a woman who had asked for three examples of mistakes made by his administration. \"Do we want leadership - as it's called - that can't face reality and admit mistakes?\" Mr Kerry asked a Democratic rally in Ohio. </p> <p>But the president has been just as active in setting out the parameters of Wednesday's debate. With Iraq on the sidelines for now, Mr Bush has abandoned momentarily the \"flip-flop\" label that has dogged Mr Kerry throughout the campaign to focus on making the case that the Democratic candidate is a tax-and-spend liberal. </p> <p>Mr Bush used the \"liberal\" epithet four times in Missouri, and stayed with the theme in campaign appearances at the weekend. In the mid west battleground states of Iowa and Minnesota, Mr Bush moved to cast the Democratic challenger as a high-spending liberal who would raise taxes to pay for government welfare programmes. Mr Kerry \"can run but can't hide\" from his past support for tax increases, Mr Bush repeatedly said. </p> <p>The Republicans have homed in on Mr Kerry's healthcare plan, saying it would create an unwieldy government bureaucracy. \"If you like the DMV [department of motor vehicles] and you want to get that for your healthcare, you're going to love the Kerry plan,\" Mr Bush's campaign manager, Ken Mehlman, said yesterday. </p> <p>Mr Edwards has also become a target. A millionaire trial attorney before entering politics, he has become a convenient focus for Republican charges that health costs have escalated because of lawsuits. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Mr Kerry was out courting the crucial black vote yesterday. He attended two church services in Miami, one with Haitian Catholics and the other with black Baptists, where the Rev Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton tied his election to the civil rights struggle. \"We have an unfinished march in this nation,\" Associated Press reported Mr Kerry as saying at the Friendship Missionary Baptist church. </p> <p>\"Never again will a million African Americans be denied the right to exercise their vote in the United States,\" he added, referring to the disputed Florida recount in the 2000 presidential race. </p> <p>Black turnout is key to Mr Kerry winning in Florida and elsewhere - less than 10% of black voters nationally supported Mr Bush in 2000.</p>",
  "They didn't mention Ken Bigley, of course. He - like his two American companions - was gone, dead, brutally murdered and therefore unavailable to participate in Mr Bush's long but resolute struggle or Mr Kerry's more hopeful tomorrow. Nor, for that matter, did they mention Ariel Sharon or the debris of Gaza or Saudi Arabia's fragile autocracy or Egypt's shattered tourist industry. To be honest, they didn't mention much at all. <p>Is that it, then? Has St Louis put a lid on foreign debate so far as this US election goes? Is the choice for America, and therefore us, just more of the same - or \"smart\" plans from a supposedly smart man who seems to believe that one summit will leave the world saluting him? I'm all right, Jacques? </p> <p>Once you put aside the buzz from the first joust in Florida - why did that funny little commander-in-chief keep scowling and twitching like Queeg doing his full Caine Mutiny routine? - then round two was a bit of a drag. Bush reprised the theme songs from his best-loved album of lying ads. (Flop flip, I was taking a dip!) John Kerry reiterated his handy conviction that angst over mangled voting and phrase-making was better than blundering into war. Neither of them knew quite what to say to a puzzled lady whose travelling friends had found America bottom of their holiday hit parade. </p> <p>Kerry thought that was Bush's fault. Bush said he did what he thought was right and didn't much care if \"these people\", otherwise referred to as \"these Europeans\", got the hump. And anyway, Tony Blair was with him. Take one Blair, one Berlusconi, plus a pinch of Poland and Oz, and you had the wonder of coalition, ridding the globe of a \"unique threat\". </p> <p>But, as he strutted and harangued and tried to look feistier than he managed in that first scowlathon, there was one obvious difficulty. George Bush has no Einstein pretensions. Launch him into a dissertation on, say, stem cell research and it's even money whether he will make it out alive. John Kerry ought to be much better than that. Yet, curiously, he isn't. </p> <p>Kerry pronounces names and places rather more accurately than the world's most powerful flubber. He's been to Kyoto and sat in the salons of Europe. He eats gravitas with muesli for breakfast. He should know his stuff. But if he does, he's not telling. </p> <p>Maybe, in the pantheon of things, that won't matter too much because it will never become relevant. Maybe the president is going to win this contest willy-nilly (as the local polls from Florida, Ohio and Wisconsin still suggest). But it's closer by far than it was. Events, dear boy, continue to undermine White House certainties. There is too much bleating about the Bush and a clear possibility that President Kerry (like Spain's Zapatero) could actually be stuck with running a country. What then? </p> <p>His fabled summit to persuade France, Germany and the rest to put in troops so America's boys can head back to Fort Bragg won't work just because Kerry isn't Bush. The bill, the danger and the manifest unpopularity of joining a queue winding into the distance without any exit signs are constants whoever sits in the Oval Office. Worse, to be really credible, his new, expanded coalition will need many Muslim troops on the ground. This (as the carnage in Egypt shows) is their war too. Al-Qaida is the peril within, as Saddam himself realised. </p> <p>But how do you even begin to add that dimension to your alliance when, time and again, Israel kicks away its foundations? Forget the road map; forget any hope of a Palestinian state. Obfuscation is the name of Sharon's game, according to his gabbiest senior adviser, and Washington is trailing compliantly along behind. I won't deal with Arafat, Bush says proudly; but he won't deal with anybody else either. </p> <p>Republican policy is an empty vessel drifting off Tel Aviv, and the Democratic alternative has just as little stored in its hold. (Indeed, on any historical test, the Democrats are less rather than more likely to stand up to an Israel going its own sweet way.) </p> <p>Yet Kerry must know that the Arab world (and much of Europe) won't respond to his Iraq distress calls unless there's a decisive return to road-map action. He must know that even Blair and Bush are at loggerheads over Israel. He must realise that a fresh start here is the key to a fresh start in Baghdad. But he didn't mention it. </p> <p>Nor, alas, did any of those long, fruitful weeks at foreign policy seminars yield the most minimal shift in perception. It is Bush who (quite rightly) seeks to set North Korea in its context, and Kerry who cranks up the threat. It is Bush who, bruised by Iraq, turns more warily and multilaterally towards Tehran, and Kerry who unleashes the rockets of empty rhetoric. </p> <p>When Bush promises to keep America safe, Kerry pledges to make it even safer. When Bush promises more spending on homeland security, Kerry trumps it. When Bush rattles on about the war on terrorism and the forces of evil who mastermind it, Kerry betrays not a murmur of nuance. </p> <p>Why did Saddam want nuclear weapons? Because the real threats in his area - Israel, Pakistan, India, China and Russia - have them. Because Iran, just next door, is getting them. Why didn't Saddam tell the UN inspectors he was flat out of WMDs and open his doors wide? Because he didn't want Tehran to know. </p> <p>The complications here stretch far beyond America versus Osama and friends. The challenges and the answers we will have to find are inevitably complex and thoughtful, not tough; subtle, not no-brain certain. But did the voters of middle America get a hint of that when they needed it? Meet me in St Louis, Phooey! </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:p.preston@theguardian.com\">p.preston@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "The president of Taiwan, Chen Shui-bian, attempted to restart peace talks with Beijing yesterday, calling for an arms control agreement and a new code of conduct to dispel the \"dark forces\" threatening cross-strait relations. <p>In his most conciliatory speech since taking office in 2000, the independence-minded leader said he was ready to resume negotiations after a five-year gap, on the basis of a previous agreement he had earlier rejected. </p> <p>The National Day address, which also included praise for China's reforms, appeared aimed at striking up a new relationship with the mainland, which views Taiwan as a renegade province that must be reunited by force if necessary. </p> <p>It comes less than a month after a major shift in Beijing's leadership, under which the former president Jiang Zemin - considered a hardliner on the issue of Taiwan - gave up control of the military to the current leader, Hu Jintao, who has stressed the need for a \"peaceful rise\" for China. </p> <p>Commentators warned earlier this year that the threat of war was greater than at any time in a decade. </p> <p>Mr Chen accused China of targeting Taiwan with 600 ballistic missiles, but called on both sides to step back from the brink. \"The threat of military force represents the greatest shadow of terror and forces of darkness across the Taiwan Strait,\" he said. \"Therefore, I propose that both sides should seriously consider the issue of arms control and take concrete actions to reduce tension and military threats.\" </p> <p>He called for confidence-building measures, including a new code of conduct and the reassertion of the negotiating principles laid down in 1992 when Taiwan and China accepted the principle that they were \"one country\", but agreed to differ about their interpretation of what that implied. </p> <p>Mr Chen had rejected this fudge, but said yesterday it was a \"not necessarily perfect, but acceptable\" basis for the resumption of dialogue. </p> <p>But he also said that his government would push ahead with plans to buy \u00a310bn of arms from the United States and reform the constitution, a move that China has warned could lead to war. </p> <p>Beijing has yet to respond, but it is likely to remain suspicious about the intentions of Mr Chen, whose core supporters favour independence.</p>",
  "<p>Ever since a so-called \"wardrobe malfunction\" revealed Janet Jackson's breast in the Super Bowl half time show in January, American television has been swept up in a panic about sex on television, the moral of equivalent of Hurricane Ivan. The Federal Communications Commission has finally proposed a record $550,000 fine against CBS for what has been dubbed Nipplegate. </p> <p>The FCC stated: \"Anything goes is not an acceptable mantra for those that elect to earn their profits on the public airwaves\". Since Jackson revealed all, the FCC has been throwing fines around like confetti at a wedding and so far this year's penalties have easily overtaken the total sum for the last ten years added together. </p> <p>There is more to come. In June the US Senate overwhelmingly voted to raise the standard fine ten fold, from a paltry $27,500 to $275,000 per incident with a $3m daily tariff available for persistent violations. </p> <p>So for months broadcasters have been blindly rewriting and cutting programmes, trying to judge the political mood music which has grown more insistent as the election grows closer. Producers no longer know where nervous networks are drawing the hazy line on taste. As Steven Bochco, creator of Hill Street Blues and NYPD Blue, said recently, \"I'm not doing something I know is to be really provocative. If I do the networks will blur it. They will cut it. They will perform artless surgery.\" </p> <p>Artless surgery has already been performed on ER, where the breast of an elderly cancer patient was deemed offensive and even on the US version of the Antiques Roadshow, where a 50-year old lithograph of a nude was hurriedly excised. When public television edited out language in Prime Suspect that was previously acceptable there was a chorus of complaints about censorship. </p> <p>While the regulated public airwaves - the networks and public radio and television - grow ever more uncertain and anxious as the chilling effect of cultural McCarthyism sets in, cable channels, unaccountable to the FCC, grow ever more explicit. </p> <p>A recent opinion poll indicated that viewers were more relaxed about sexual content than the politicians proclaimed, with just 17% of those surveyed \"very concerned\" about the Jackson incident. This is little comfort to the regulated over-the-air networks who are losing ground to anything-goes cable channels. As one pollster put it: \"The audiences think that cable is more entertaining, more provocative and unique.\" He might have added that cable is more opinionated, and more politically biased. </p> <p>In the ever more fractious, ever more tetchy debate between left and right in the run-up to an election the quickest way to write a bestseller is to pen a polemic about media bias. So Ann Coulter and Bill O'Reilly from the right, and Michael Moore and Al Franken on the left, slug it out with John Grisham and Tom Clancy in the bestseller list. </p> <p>Taste and decency has increasingly become part of this political eye gouging. The rightwing Parents Television Council led the email campaign against Jackson. </p> <p>The even more rightwing American Family Association continue to attack Disney \"for their promotion of the homosexual agenda\", claiming that \"While a day at Disney World might not seem like Sodom and Gomorrah it might just take us there\". All this white noise has inhibited not just producers in drama but the gatherers of news. </p> <p>The recent funeral in Phoenix of an ex-football star soldier who was killed in Afghanistan was unceremoniously pulled in the middle of a live broadcast when a speaker used bad language. </p> <p>All this is a neat diversion from some of the real obscenities lurking in the American television undergrowth: the potent effect of negative political election advertising; the lack of robust political interviewing; the absence of tough investigations like The Secret Policeman; the blurring of content and commerce as product placement runs wild. </p> <p>For British television, more tightly regulated and with a stronger public service ethos baked into the system, this might all seem very distant and quaintly American. But, as ever, America is the canary in the television coalmine. Here some politicians would like to switch from party political broadcasts to advertising; robust interviewers are subjected to widespread criticism; attempts are made to suppress investigations like The Secret Policeman; in the Sky Plus and Tivo world, commercial broadcasters here will also increasingly push for product placement. </p> <p>As we start the long wind-up to our own election it's worth noting how political the imperatives of US global media companies are. Sumner Redstone of Viacom, the owner of CBS. put it neatly: \"I don't want to denigrate Kerry ... but from a Viacom standpoint the election of a Republican administration is a better deal.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>John Willis is the BBC's director of factual and learning.</p>"
