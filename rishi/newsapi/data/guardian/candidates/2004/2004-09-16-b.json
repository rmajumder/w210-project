  "President George Bush was warned in July that Iraq could descend into all-out civil war, according to a classified estimate which summarised the views of a number of US intelligence agencies. <p>Even the best-case scenario for Iraq is a political, economic and security situation described as tenuous. </p> <p>The National Intelligence Estimate predicts three possible scenarios: tenuous stability, political fragmentation, or civil war. </p> <p>The 50-page document, prepared in July before the latest upsurge in violence brought a sharp increase in Iraqi civilians killed and attacks on American troops, has yet to be officially released. </p> <p>A spokesman for the national security council, Scott McCormack, confirmed its existence and remained upbeat, but refused to discuss the details. </p> <p>\"In the past, including before the war to liberate Iraq, there were many different scenarios that were possible, including the outbreak of civil war. It hasn't happened,\" he said. </p> <p>\"The Iraqi people continue to defy the predictions of pundits and others.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile, even Republican senators described the administration's reconstruction efforts as \"beyond pitiful\" and \"exasperating from any vantage point,\" when the White House sought to divert $3bn from reconstruction to security. </p> <p>The administration dismissed the criticism, the White House spokesman Scott McClellan calling critics \"pessimists and hand-wringers\". </p> <p>The estimate was commissioned by the outgoing CIA director, George Tenet, who told Mr Bush that the intelligence case for Iraq's ownership of weapons of mass destruction was a \"slam dunk\". </p> <p>That prediction, alongside the one that the Iraqi people would greet the US and British soldiers like liberators, failed to materialise, leaving many in Mr Bush's national security team gloomy. </p> <p>\"There doesn't seem to be much optimism,\" an official told Reuters. </p> <p>\"There is a significant amount of pessimism,\" an officer told the New York Times. </p> <p>Despite stiff criticism from those Republican and Democratic senators who believed the situation might be spiralling out of control, the administration brushed off the bleak conclusions about Iraq's immediate future. </p> <p>\"You know every step of the way in Iraq there have been pessimists and hand-wringers who said it can't be done,\" Mr McClellan said. </p> <p>\"And every step of the way the Iraqi leadership and the Iraqi people have proven them wrong because they are determined to have a free and peaceful future.\" </p> <p>More than 1,000 US soldiers have been killed in the conflict so far, and between 12,700 and 14,800 Iraqi civilians, according to the website Iraqbodycount.org, which keeps a tally based on at least two approved news sources. </p> <p>The Democratic presidential challenger, John Kerry, seized on the leaks, saying that it was unlikely that Iraq would be ready to hold elections by January. </p> <p>\"I think it is very difficult to see today how you're going to distribute ballots in places like Falluja and Ramadi and Najaf and other parts of the country, without having established the security,\" he said. </p> <p>\"I'm not sure the president is being honest with the American people about that situation either, at this point.\" </p> <p>At a hearing to discuss the White House's requests to divert more than $3bn (about \u00a31.6bn) from aid to security, senators of both main parties lambasted the lack of progress on the ground. </p> <p>So far less than $1bn of the $18.4bn allocated has been spent. </p> <p>The Republican chairman of the foreign relations committee, Senator Richard Lugar, said the situation in Iraq was \"exasperating for anybody to look at from any vantage point\". </p> <p>Referring to the lack of overall spending on aid, Senator Chuck Hagel, a Republican from Nebraska, said: \"It's beyond pitiful, it's beyond embarrassing. It is now in the zone of dangerous.\" </p> <p>But the most excoriating attack came from the Democrat Senator Joseph Biden. </p> <p>\"The president has frequently described Iraq as 'the central front of the war on terror',\" he said. \"Well by that definition, success in Iraq is a key standard by which to measure the war on terror. And by that measure, I think the war on terror is in trouble.\" </p> <p><b> Jonathan Steele, page 28 Leader comment, page 29</b><br></p>",
  "A bitter row over France's commitment to Europe has split the country's Socialist opposition, with senior figures in the party warning yesterday that it is tearing itself apart. <p>The turmoil started after the party's number two, the former prime minister Laurent Fabius, said he would vote against the European constitution, because it enshrined a liberal, free-market vision of economic and social policy that would undermine French efforts to boost employment and stop firms moving to low-wage, low-tax countries. </p> <p>Mr Fabius's announcement sparked fury among his opponents in the party, headed by the Socialist leader, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande. </p> <p>They believe Mr Fabius's declaration was an opening gambit in the two rival leaders' widely expected fight for the left's presidential nomination in 2007. </p> <p>\"I don't think anyone has any doubts about [Mr Fabius's] motives,\" the former Socialist interior minister Daniel Vaillant said yesterday. He said the party's line on the constitution, agreed last year, was that the treaty was not perfect but was also not worth \"tearing ourselves to pieces for\". </p> <p>The former agriculture minister Jean Glavany said Mr Fabius, 58, had now \"knocked over the table\" in pursuit of his presidential ambitions. </p> <p>Bernard Kouchne, a former health minister, accused him of \"treachery\". </p> <p>The row is a severe setback for the party, which lost heavily in presidential and parliamentary elections in 2002 but recovered this year with convincing victories in European and regional polls. </p> <p>One leading Socialist, Fran\u00e7ois Rebsalem, went as far as to say that if the Socialists did vote no to the constitution, \"it will be the end of the party. It will be very difficult for us to win another election for some time.\" </p> <p>Mr Fabius's announcement has also made the party an easy target for the French president, Jacques Chirac, and his ruling conservatives. </p> <p>The finance minister, Nicolas Sarkozy, said the Socialists were making a \"historic mistake\", while Mr Chirac has promised not to let the referendum be derailed by \"partisan\" domestic politics. (The president, having decided to hold a public plebiscite rather than ratify the treaty in parliament, would, of course, be one of the first to lose face in the event of a no vote.) </p> <p>France's Socialists are to finalise their position on the question within the next two months. Their decision could determine the way the country votes in its referendum, scheduled for the second half of 2005. A poll this week showed the electorate finely balanced, with 51% in favour of the treaty, 34% against and 15% undecided. </p> <p>Richard Corbett, a leading Labour MEP, said a no vote in France would \"provoke a terrible crisis in the European Union\". In Britain as in other countries, Mr Corbett said, \"it is the right fighting against the treaty. Mr Fabius is fighting the wrong fight.\"</p>",
  "<p>Threats by the Democratic US presidential candidate, John Kerry, to pull out of trade agreements if he wins the November election are campaign rhetoric rather than promises, the head of the World Trade Organisation said yesterday. </p> <p>Mr Kerry has accused George Bush of not defending US economic interests abroad aggressively enough and has said he will review major trade deals that previous administrations signed up to. </p> <p>But Dr Supachai Panitchpakdi, in London to launch the WTO's World Trade Report 2005, said trade was a \"non-partisan issue\". </p> <p>\"People have used this sort of rhetoric during campaigns but then, when they govern, they have to observe the rules their country has signed up to.\" </p> <p>The WTO's 147 member countries thrashed out an 11th-hour deal in Geneva in July, which put the \"Doha round\" of world trade talks back on track. Negotiators pledged to work towards a concrete accord by the end of next year. </p> <p>However, the process is currently on hold because of the US election, which could lead to a new American trade representative replacing Robert Zoellick, while Peter Mandelson replaces Pascal Lamy as European trade commissioner in November. </p> <p>Dr Supachai said he would meet Mr Mandelson soon and impress upon him the need to maintain the impetus that led to the July deal. \"I will make clear to him the need for us to build on the July framework. We need to keep that sense of urgency,\" he said. </p> <p>Dr Supachai did not want to be tied down to the December 2005 deadline that Mr Lamy and others talked of in July. He said: \"It depends on what we do this year, but the key will be the first half of next year.\" </p> <p>Economists have estimated that a final deal could add more than $500bn (\u00a3277bn) a year to the world economy. However, experts say much work remains to be done if the west is to make good on its promise to reduce its lavish farm subsidies and allow poor countries greater access to its markets. </p> <p>Dr Supachai said the WTO's recent rulings against US subsidies to its cotton farmers and European Union sugar subsidies should have no impact on the progress of the trade talks. </p> <p>The World Trade Report said global trade volumes had expanded 4.5% last year. It predicted stronger growth this year on the back of a recovering world economy. </p> <p>It stressed the importance of \"coherence\" in the economic policies of the countries in the Doha round, so that the benefits of freer trade were not diminished by, for example, poor domestic economic policies or bad infrastructure. </p> <p>\"Governments cannot hope to reap the real benefits of open trade if they fail to secure macroeconomic stability, supportive infrastructure, properly functioning domestic markets and sound institutions,\" said Dr Supachai. </p> <p>The report said the WTO would only seek to free up trade where it was clearly in the interests of all countries concerned: \"Cooperation should not be forced upon governments where there is no perception of a common interest.\"</p>",
  "<p>John Lewis, the department store and Waitrose supermarket chain, yesterday reported strong sales and profits growth, and told staff the results were cause \"to celebrate\". </p> <p>Chairman Sir Stuart Hampson said the group had set \"a cracking pace\" in its first half and he was looking forward to the second half - which includes the crucial Christmas season - with confidence. </p> <p>The group, which is a partnership, recorded \u00a32.5bn in sales in the six months to the end of July and trading profit climbed 22% to \u00a3116m. Pre-tax profits, boosted by one-offs such as property gains, were ahead 80% at \u00a376m. Sir Stuart said: \"Things have been coming together rather well.\" </p> <p>He warned against further interest rate rises, however. \"We don't see any reason for it. It is not an overheated market in retail terms.\" </p> <p>Comparative sales at John Lewis rose 4.6%, despite price falls. \"Deflation is a fact of life that we have to live with now. Electricals prices just do not go up. Increasingly it is the same for fashion. It is tough for retailers but good for shoppers.\" </p> <p>Branded women's fashion, linen, beds, audio and TV goods were \"storming along\". </p> <p>The Oxford Street store achieved a 6% sales increase in the first half, but Sir Stuart insisted that the impact of the congestion charge - which John Lewis campaigns against - was not wearing off. </p> <p>\"That figure now includes Sunday opening and, compared with two years ago, we are still 2% behind.\" </p> <p>The partnership is fighting an extension of the charging zone, which would take in its revamped Peter Jones outlet in Sloane Square, London. Some \u00a3100m has been spent on refurbishment and sales are up 16% since its June reopening. </p> <p>New department stores are planned for Trafford, Manchester, followed by Lisburn, Northern Ireland, and Cardiff. </p> <p>First-half results at Waitrose suggest it is still winning customers from ailing upmarket rivals J Sainsbury and Marks &amp; Spencer. Comparative sales were ahead 3.7%. Of the 19 Safeway stores acquired in the north, the seven so far converted had shown there was big demand for Waitrose outside its south-east heartland.</p>",
  "Afghanistan's president, Hamid Karzai, yesterday evaded an apparent assassination attempt, when a rocket attack missed his helicopter. <p>President Karzai was on an official trip to a school opening in Gardez, south of the capital, Kabul. A US military spokesman, Major Mark McCann, said one rocket was fired as the helicopter was landing, hitting the ground 300m away. \"The president did not appear to be in any danger,\" he said. </p> <p>The presidential security team, which includes an army of American private security consultants flanking the president everywhere he goes, quickly aborted the landing and rushed Mr Karzai back to Kabul. </p> <p>Mr Karzai's spokesman, Khaleeq Ahmed, said the president had felt that the move was an over-reaction and was \"very disappointed\" not to be able to visit the school as planned. </p> <p>President Karzai has rarely been seen outside the presidential palace since an assassination attempt two years ago in Kandahar. But during the current presidential campaign, he has been attending more official events, in an attempt to heighten his public profile before the October 9 election.</p>",
  "Researchers in Maryland recently completed a world-wide poll to see how citizens of countries beyond America would vote in the forthcoming presidential election. They rang millions of random numbers all across the globe, with one particular call certainly taking Osama bin Laden by surprise. <p>\"Hello, we are phoning from the United States to see if you are a supporter of George Bush.\" </p> <p>\"Um...no, not really...\" </p> <p>\"Do you think he has done enough to catch Osama bin Laden?\" </p> <p>\"Yes, plenty, there's nothing else he should do...\" </p> <p>\"OK, could we just take your name, please?\" </p> <p>\"It's Mr Bin-, I mean, Robinson, Monty Robinson, from Reykjavik, oh yes, I love fish.\" </p> <p>As it turned out, Osama suddenly began to worry that John Kerry might be lying about his war record and so ended up plumping for Dubya. </p> <p>But just about everyone else seems to be hoping for a Democrat victory. In Norway, the margin was 74% for Kerry and only 7% for Bush, with the president getting the same level of support in Spain and only 5% in France. Even if Bush got this share of the vote at home, he'll somehow manage to fiddle it so he wins. </p> <p>It is hardly surprising that Kerry has inspired so many people around the world, because his outstanding attributes are plain to see. Firstly, who can have failed to notice that wonderful \"not-George-Bush\" quality about him? Plus there is that certain \"un-Dubya-ness\" he seems to possess, not to mention what the French call the \"il n'est pas George Bush\" aspect of his personality. </p> <p>Many of us have been moved to tears by his speeches. \"Is that the best the Democrats can do?\" we wept. And there is the fact that he served in Vietnam, where he was seriously injured by enemy fire, leaving army surgeons with no choice but to amputate his charisma. </p> <p>But the tragedy is that while millions of us in Europe and beyond desperately care about who becomes the next president, none of us has any influence over the outcome. The time has come for European liberals to get together and do something about this. </p> <p>One possibility might be to make commercials of our own to put out on American TV. Obviously, we couldn't let on that we were a bunch of lefty foreigners - we'd have to give our organisation an authentic-sounding alias - something neutral like the American Creationist Freedom Rifle Patriots for Truth. </p> <p>But imagine the impact of some grainy footage of a young Dubya, with a gravelly voice-over whispering: \"Everyone knows that George Bush did not fight for his country during the Vietnam war. This is because he was actually fighting for the Vietcong, leading the infamous Gay Jihad Atheists Squad, who captured American soldiers and forced them to become vegetarians and play soccer.\" </p> <p>Never mind that every time we express outrage that George Bush wriggled out of going to Vietnam, we privately think: \"Excellent move, George, that's exactly what I would have done.\" By the time the facts were checked the damage would be done, and Bush would be 20 points behind in the polls. </p> <p>The only trouble with this idea is that the various European directors would never be able to agree on a style for the commercial. The French would want to film it as an allegorical three-hour internal monologue from a chain-smoking poet battling writer's block. </p> <p>The British would have Hugh Grant as a love-struck ex-Beatle who gets mistaken for John Kerry by Emma Thompson. In the end the whole project would be handed over to the experimental Prague Cartoon Workshop, which has just won lots of awards for its unusual animation style when in fact it's just not very good at drawing. </p> <p>If the advert idea is a non-starter, there is a more direct way that non-American liberals can get involved in the US election. Why don't we just offer to buy the votes of all those US citizens who aren't really that bothered? A majority of Americans won't even take part in the most important election in the world, and I'm sure they'd appreciate the $20 or $30 that lots of us would quite willingly pay to cast their votes for them. </p> <p>So I call on all apolitical skint Americans to get themselves a postal vote and auction it on eBay. What could be more in the spirit of American capitalist democracy than disenfranchising yourself for the sake of some cash? </p> <p>The laws of the free market would settle the price of a ballot paper; votes from swing states would go for that much more, of course, although personally I'm hoping for a vote in Texas, because it will be so humiliating when Bush even loses his home state. Sadly, in my first attempt to bid for a vote, I lost the auction to someone calling themselves GWB@whitehouse.us. </p> <p>Still, the winner was kind enough to send me an email. It said: \"Nice try, limey, but we've got a lot more money than you and you're not the first person to have this idea. P.S. How do you think I got in last time?\" </p>",
  "<p>The West Wing<br> 7.35pm, Channel4 </p> <p>Series four of the political drama at last makes its terrestrial debut with an episode that finds President Bartlet (Martin Sheen) on the re-election trail. \"This is a time for American heroes,\" he tells his audience, and you can tell this is farfetched fiction because he's talking about the need for the USA to reduce its dependence on oil. Much of the rest of the episode is taken up with the misadventures of White House staffers Josh, Toby and Donna when they're stranded after missing their motorcade lift. Safe to say the trio's Washington cynicism plays badly in the heart of rural Indiana. The last season to be overseen by creator Aaron Sorkin is as sharply written as its predecessors, although the liberal attitudes of its Democratic protagonists may provoke some nostalgia in the Republican era of George Bush. </p> <p><strong>Ten Ways to Get On the Property Ladder</strong><br> 8pm, Five </p> <p>Friday, it seems, is now Five's property night.

  "'Bring them on!\" President Bush challenged the early Iraqi insurgency in July of last year. Since then, 812 American soldiers have been killed and 6,290 wounded, according to the Pentagon. Almost every day, in campaign speeches, Bush speaks with bravado about how he is \"winning\" in Iraq. \"Our strategy is succeeding,\" he boasted to the National Guard convention on Tuesday. <p>But, according to the US military's leading strategists and prominent retired generals, Bush's war is already lost. Retired general William Odom, former head of the National Security Agency, told me: \"Bush hasn't found the WMD. Al-Qaida, it's worse, he's lost on that front. That he's going to achieve a democracy there? That goal is lost, too. It's lost.\" He adds: \"Right now, the course we're on, we're achieving Bin Laden's ends.\" </p> <p>Retired general Joseph Hoare, the former marine commandant and head of US Central Command, told me: \"The idea that this is going to go the way these guys planned is ludicrous. There are no good options. We're conducting a campaign as though it were being conducted in Iowa, no sense of the realities on the ground. It's so unrealistic for anyone who knows that part of the world. The priorities are just all wrong.\" </p> <p>Jeffrey Record, professor of strategy at the Air War College, said: \"I see no ray of light on the horizon at all. The worst case has become true. There's no analogy whatsoever between the situation in Iraq and the advantages we had after the second world war in Germany and Japan.\" </p> <p>W Andrew Terrill, professor at the Army War College's strategic studies institute - and the top expert on Iraq there - said: \"I don't think that you can kill the insurgency\". According to Terrill, the anti-US insurgency, centred in the Sunni triangle, and holding several cities and towns - including Fallujah - is expanding and becoming more capable as a consequence of US policy. </p> <p>\"We have a growing, maturing insurgency group,\" he told me. \"We see larger and more coordinated military attacks. They are getting better and they can self-regenerate. The idea there are x number of insurgents, and that when they're all dead we can get out is wrong. The insurgency has shown an ability to regenerate itself because there are people willing to fill the ranks of those who are killed. The political culture is more hostile to the US presence. The longer we stay, the more they are confirmed in that view.\" </p> <p>After the killing of four US contractors in Fallujah, the marines besieged the city for three weeks in April - the watershed event for the insurgency. \"I think the president ordered the attack on Fallujah,\" said General Hoare. \"I asked a three-star marine general who gave the order to go to Fallujah and he wouldn't tell me. I came to the conclusion that the order came directly from the White House.\" Then, just as suddenly, the order was rescinded, and Islamist radicals gained control, using the city as a base. </p> <p>\"If you are a Muslim and the community is under occupation by a non-Islamic power it becomes a religious requirement to resist that occupation,\" Terrill explained. \"Most Iraqis consider us occupiers, not liberators.\" He describes the religious imagery common now in Fallujah and the Sunni triangle: \"There's talk of angels and the Prophet Mohammed coming down from heaven to lead the fighting, talk of martyrs whose bodies are glowing and emanating wonderful scents.\" </p> <p>\"I see no exit,\" said Record. \"We've been down that road before. It's called Vietnamisation. The idea that we're going to have an Iraqi force trained to defeat an enemy we can't defeat stretches the imagination. They will be tainted by their very association with the foreign occupier. In fact, we had more time and money in state building in Vietnam than in Iraq.\" </p> <p>General Odom said: \"This is far graver than Vietnam. There wasn't as much at stake strategically, though in both cases we mindlessly went ahead with the war that was not constructive for US aims. But now we're in a region far more volatile, and we're in much worse shape with our allies.\" </p> <p>Terrill believes that any sustained US military offensive against the no-go areas \"could become so controversial that members of the Iraqi government would feel compelled to resign\". Thus, an attempted military solution would destroy the slightest remaining political legitimacy. \"If we leave and there's no civil war, that's a victory.\" </p> <p>General Hoare believes from the information he has received that \"a decision has been made\" to attack Fallujah \"after the first Tuesday in November. That's the cynical part of it - after the election. The signs are all there.\" </p> <p>He compares any such planned attack to the late Syrian dictator Hafez al-Asad's razing of the rebel city of Hama. \"You could flatten it,\" said Hoare. \"US military forces would prevail, casualties would be high, there would be inconclusive results with respect to the bad guys, their leadership would escape, and civilians would be caught in the middle. I hate that phrase collateral damage. And they talked about dancing in the street, a beacon for democracy.\" </p> <p>General Odom remarked that the tension between the Bush administration and the senior military officers over Iraqi was worse than any he has ever seen with any previous government, including Vietnam. \"I've never seen it so bad between the office of the secretary of defence and the military. There's a significant majority believing this is a disaster. The two parties whose interests have been advanced have been the Iranians and al-Qaida. Bin Laden could argue with some cogency that our going into Iraq was the equivalent of the Germans in Stalingrad. They defeated themselves by pouring more in there.

  "The battle for the US presidency enters new territory today with both candidates turning to scientific journals to set out their election promises. <p>In interviews in today's issue of Nature and tomorrow's Science, George Bush and John Kerry outline their positions - from whether the US should build nuclear weapons to global climate change. </p> <p>The arguments are mostly well-established but their engagement with the scientific establishment is revealing. </p> <p>The most divisive issue is stem cell research. Mr Bush froze federal funding for research on embryonic stem cell lines created after 2001 in a move that incensed many biologists who felt such research represented the future. </p> <p>Mr Bush tells Nature he is \"committed to pursuing stem cell research without crossing a fundamental moral line\". </p> <p>Mr Kerry says he would lift the \"ideologically driven\" limits by over-turning the ban on federal funding of research on new stem cell lines. </p> <p>He is also direct on nuclear weapons: \"I would end the pursuit of a new generation of nuclear weapons.\" </p> <p>In contrast, Mr Bush points to his budget plans for 2005, which contain allowances for an increase in weapons activities. He says: \"The nuclear posture review release by my administration in January 2002 noted that the nation's nuclear infrastructure had atrophied since the end of the cold war and that the evolving security environment requires a flexible and responsive weapons-complex infrastructure.\" </p> <p>He calls climate change \"a serious long-term issue\" and says he wants to sequester carbon and alleviate the rise in greenhouse gas emissions in partnership with other countries. </p> <p>Mr Kerry says: \"I will take the United States back to the international negotiating table while working at home to take concrete steps to reduce pollution, setting concrete limits to halt and reverse growth in global warming pollution and tapping the ingenuity of American industry.\"</p>",
  "The problems dogging John Kerry's presidential campaign deepened yesterday as a row over the authenticity of documents about George Bush's National Guard service took centre stage. <p>The Kerry campaign insists it had nothing to do with the documents, which contain derogatory remarks about Mr Bush's National Guard service, apparently written by a superior officer in the early 1970s. But evidence that they may be forgeries could damage Mr Kerry's challenge when he is trailing in the polls and striving to regain his footing. </p> <p>Forensic scrutiny of the typefaces, spacing and verbal style of the National Guard memos could help shield Mr Bush against a concerted Democratic attack on his Vietnam era record. </p> <p>\"The 'forgeries' have become the story, not the story itself,\" David Corn, the Washington editor of the Nation magazine, said. </p> <p>The timing of the appearance of the documents has led some Democrats to wonder if they had been put into circulation to discredit the anti-Bush effort. Fingers have begun to point - as they often do among Democrats - at Karl Rove, the president's electoral mastermind. </p> <p>\"If this is Rove, it is his greatest masterpiece,\" a Kerry campaign adviser said yesterday. </p> <p>The rumours may say more about the extraordinary powers attributed to Mr Rove by his adversaries than about the facts. CBS News, which first reported the documents last week, is not saying where they came from, but according to some press reports, they were provided by a retired officer with a grievance over hospital bills. </p> <p>The memos appear to be signed by Lieutenant Colonel Jerry Killian, Mr Bush's commander in the Texas Air National Guard, who died 20 years ago. They rail against the young pilot and ambassador's son for failing to attend a compulsory physical examination and complain about pressure from senior officers to \"sugar coat\" his performance evaluation. </p> <p>Since their publication, several experts have questioned whether they could have been produced on typewriters available at that time, although the technical evidence is not conclusive. </p> <p>Yesterday, to cloud an already murky picture, Lt Col Killian's former secretary declared that the documents were forged, but were factually correct. </p> <p>\"These are not real. They're not what I typed, and I would have typed them for him,\" the former secretary, Marian Carr Knox, told the Dallas Morning News. </p> <p>However, Ms Knox added: \"The information in here was correct, but it was picked up from the real [documents].\" </p> <p>Both she and another former colleague of Lt Col Killian, Richard Via, recalled that he had kept careful notes on Mr Bush's shortcomings and transgressions as a pilot and stored them in a locked filing cabinet, the contents of which have since gone missing. </p> <p>Mr Corn said it was unlikely the documents were the work of Mr Rove and the Bush camp. \"The cost of being caught is too high,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Corn said it was more likely the documents had been recreated by someone who was familiar with the originals and who was angry they had disappeared. </p> <p>Mr Kerry's drop in the polls after a month of attacks by conservative veterans questioning his claim to Vietnam combat medals, has led to hurried efforts to bolster his team. It was reported yesterday that Mike McCurry, the White House spokesman who saw Bill Clinton through the Monica Lewinsky saga, would join the candidate on the campaign trail to help deal with the media. </p> <p>Senator Kerry's aides argue their campaign has suffered because the US media has focused more on sideshows such as the row over the documents than on substantive issues such as Iraq, unemployment and healthcare. </p> <p>They also point out that the Democratic candidate's gaffes seem to get more of an airing than those of the president. Last month, Senator Kerry got the name of a stadium wrong in football-mad Wisconsin. His mistake has been broadcast relentlessly since, even becoming the subject of a Washington Post article yesterday, weeks after the slip. </p> <p>By contrast, Democrats believe Mr Bush's slips have been treated as footnotes, even when he claimed earlier this month to have called for more funding for the Iraq occupation \"which is money for armour and body parts and ammunition and fuel\". </p> <p>Mr McCurry's job is to try to divert the attention of the media away from Mr Kerry's shortcomings towards the administration's failures. </p> <p>As Charlie Cook, a Washington political pundit, put it: \"If the campaign spotlight ends up shining on Bush, Bush loses. If it focuses on Kerry, Kerry loses.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Americans, least of all in an election year dominated by the aftermath of 9/11, hate being whupped. That is the simple but cogent explanation for the extraordinarily hardball and unusually public lobbying mounted by Boeing against its younger upstart European rival, Airbus. Having lost its supremacy in the large civilian aircraft market in the past decade, overtaken in sales for the first time last year, Boeing has launched a war against a 1992 EU-US trade agreement on subsidies for new aeroplanes. </p> <p>Today senior officials working for Bob Zoellick, the US trade representative, will have \"technical\" talks with their counterparts from Pascal Lamy's office in Brussels. But there will be little technical about these discussions given the ferocious nature of the campaign mounted by Harry Stonecipher, Boeing's tough-minded chief executive. He wants the whole goddam deal scrapped. </p> <p>There is a sense here that a dangerous debate is being unleashed, which could quite easily backfire. </p> <p>Yesterday, officials in Brussels were making it very clear that if Harry wants to renegotiate the deal, he should not be surprised if Airbus and its EU supporters (Britain, France, Germany and Spain) go for the jugular over Boeing's use of public (and hidden) subsidies. </p> <p>Stonecipher, backed by President Bush, argues that Airbus, as a successful plane-maker, no longer needs the launch aid (repaid on commercial terms) it gets for \"turkeys\" such as the A380 superjumbo or the new plane it might launch to compete against Boeing's new Dreamliner 7E7. </p> <p>Yet he airily dismisses counter-claims that Boeing not only benefits from cross-subsidies from its military and space businesses, but also from more than $3bn in tax breaks from the state of Washington. </p> <p>In spearheading a process that could ultimately lead to a World Trade Organisation case, Stonecipher is risking a trade war that neither the US nor the EU wants. Someone should tell him to calm down and concentrate on making better aeroplanes. </p> <p><strong>Only option left</strong><br> </p> <p>We had inked a multi-cornered fight for Abbey National into the autumn schedules for these pages. Now, thanks to a rather prickly James Crosby yesterday, that's not to be. </p> <p>The HBOS chief executive was busy insisting that he feels no embarrassment over the fact that he and his team spent 36 days rattling the corporate sabre - only to realise, belatedly, that the finances of an Abbey takeover just do not stack up, regardless of whether the Competition Commission would have allowed the deal through. </p> <p>He should feel embarrassed, if only for the damage to the ozone layer his public relations team have caused with all their huffing and puffing. </p> <p>Neither does this look very clever for Mr Crosby's opposite number at Abbey, Luqman Arnold. It is widely assumed that when the Abbey board recommended Banco Santander Central Hispano's paper-heavy terms in July, it was on the implicit understanding that this was the first stage in a serious auction. </p> <p>Before backing the Santander offer, Arnold had failed to clinch deals with Citigroup of the US, a tentative approach from HBOS and goodness knows who else. He had reason to believe there would be substantial interest once the For Sale sign was hoisted in public, but it simply hasn't materialised. </p> <p>The Santander offer has not swept investors off their feet. There is little appetite for the Spanish bank's paper, though the sop of a secondary London listing for the stock may help a little. </p> <p>Yet, as Santander executives kept reminding us yesterday, theirs is the only deal on the table. And, after clearance from Europe's competition authorities, the only one with so-called certainty. </p> <p><strong>Short stay</strong><br> </p> <p>We can only wince at Richard North's ejection from the chief executive's seat at InterContinental Hotels. Fresh from selling Safeway to Morrisons, new non-executive chairman David Webster has taken a quick tour of the business and come to the screamingly obvious conclusion that if InterContinental is going to go forward, rather than sideways, it needs someone who knows about promoting and developing brands, rather than simply adding the numbers up. </p> <p>Mr North can point to some success during his short tenure. He saw off the bid from Hugh Osmond just before the demerger from Six Continents (where he was financial director). It is also true that InterContinental's share price has more or less doubled since the flotation. </p> <p>But then, the institutions were never going to accept Osmond's cheeky terms, whoever was running the business. And the share price recovery says rather more about the receding worries over terror - and, in particular, the effect on business travellers - than anything else. What's more, Mr North's association with the Six Continents team, who for so long turned a deaf ear to the institutions, probably makes him a marked man for life. Just ask Sir Ian Prosser. </p> <p>Most crushing, Mr North has been told that he is really a finance director, and not a business leader. </p> <p>In the new fashion of pro-active non-executives, Mr Webster has been tough - but he's also done the right thing.</p>",

  "<p>The government is poised to announce an additional 48,000 student places at British universities.</p> <p>In the run-up to next year's expected general election the move signals ministers' determination to press ahead in the face of opposition from both Conservatives and Liberal Democrats towards its target of 50% of young people entering higher education by 2010.</p> <p>The increase, expected next September, takes account of the rising number of 18-year-olds in the population of England - a demographic \"bulge\" that is forecast to last for the next three years - but also keeps universities and colleges on track to achieve Tony Blair's 50% target, which would bring the UK up to the average participation rate among developed countries. In Scotland the number of 18-year-olds will continue to fall. </p> <p>The move will not automatically ease the pressure on university places predicted for 2005, as students rush to get in under the wire of \u00a33,000 tuition fees, but it may help to reassure parents on the election doorstep at a time when the Tories are making a \"no fees\" pitch.</p> <p>Vice-chancellors, who were yesterday thanked by the education secretary, Charles Clarke, for their support for the controversial higher education bill, which introduced top-up fees, were pleased with the news revealed during their confidential conference in Oxford this week. </p> <p>They welcomed the hint that the extra places will include three-year courses as well as two-year foundation degrees, which the government favours as a way of attracting more people into higher education.</p> <p>But members of Universities UK, which represents vice-chancellors, will look closely at the details of the expansion plan as they emerge from the government's comprehensive spending review. They will want to know how the funding council Hefce will distribute the extra places and will seek reassurances that additional students will be fully funded. </p> <p>Extra students starting next year will give universities and higher education colleges a higher base to work from when it comes to recruiting fee-payers from 2006, when they are expected to charge \u00a33,000 a year in fees. </p> <p>For many universities, however, the search is on for overseas rather than home students because they can charge them much higher fees. Research-led institutions like Oxford, Cambridge and University College London are expected to freeze or even cut the number of home and European Union undergraduates while expanding overseas and postgraduate numbers.</p> <p>Yesterday, the president of UUK, Ivor Crewe, warned that foreign students were now essential for British universities to balance their books and teach home students.</p> <p>He urged the government to adopt a coordinated national policy to market universities abroad.</p>",
  "It was the hotel where Joan Crawford was discovered after winning 100 dance contests and Bing Crosby began his singing career. <p>But despite its glamorous history, the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles is remembered for a darker moment in America's history: the 1968 assassination of Robert Kennedy took place in the hotel's kitchen on the night he had claimed victory in California's Democratic presidential primary election. </p> <p>That event presaged the decline of the Ambassador, a Hollywood landmark completed in 1921 that helped drive the westward expansion of Los Angeles. In 1989 the hotel finally closed its doors to visitors. Since then it has had an afterlife as a favourite location for film producers looking to reconstruct the glamour and opulence of Hollywood at its peak. </p> <p>Now, after 15 years of uncertainty, bankruptcy and vitriol, not to mention a period under the ownership of property magnate Donald Trump, a new fate is planned for the Ambassador: it is to be converted into a school serving one of the most needy areas of Los Angeles. </p> <p>The aim is for the $318m (\u00a3179m), 4,200-pupil school to relieve pressure in an area where 3,800 pupils have to take public transport to other areas because of a shortage of classroom places. </p> <p>But not everyone is happy about the plan. \"The school board is stealing from this city and it is murdering a piece of this city's history,\" said Mitzi March Mogul, president of the city's Art Deco Society. \"They will push this thing through like a juggernaut, but once the Ambassador has gone it won't come back.\" </p> <p>To appease conservationists, the education authority which owns the hotel has promised to create a replica of the hotel's facade along one of the city's busiest thoroughfares. It also plans to make use of one of the hotel's most famous features: the Cocoanut Grove nightclub - decorated with artificial palm trees from the set of The Son of the Sheik, starring Rudolph Valentino - will be restored to its original Moorish design and used as the school's main auditorium. </p> <p>\"This is a good compromise,\" LA schools superintendent Roy Romer said. \"It tries to preserve historic aspects, but enables us to make a workable school community.\" </p> <p>But parts of the hotel's history will be lost. Six bungalows, one of which hosted Albert Einstein (who complained about the room service) are to be demolished, along with the hotel's lobby. </p> <p>Part of the Embassy ballroom, where Kennedy gave his final speech, will be retained. But the fate of the kitchen pantry where he was shot by Sirhan Sirhan is the subject of debate. A panel will consider the feasibility of a $2m preservation project. </p> <p>\"It's not a compromise,\" said Linda Dishman, executive director of the preservation group LA Conservancy. \"Only one feature of the hotel is being preserved: the Cocoanut Grove.\" </p> <p>The group says its views are not represented by the plan, which is due to be voted on at the end of the month. </p> <p>The school district has been pig-headed,\" said Dishman. \"It says it wants to build a replica of the facade to maintain the iconic view. Why maintain something you've just pulled down? The sleight of hand is apparent.\" </p> <p>The stars, of course, did their best to destroy the hotel in its heyday. F Scott Fitzgerald and his wife Zelda set fire to their room then crept away unnoticed, leaving the bill unpaid.</p>",
  "Once every four years, America offers its expats the chance to be loved, even to be heroes. Usually no one cares about those of us who live abroad. The US state department isn't even sure how many of us are scattered around the world: somewhere around 6 or 7 million, including dependents, is the best guess - 6 or 7 million pariahs who have shunned 24-hour grocery stores, acres of sky, real football and unlimited refills of weak coffee. If we aren't in the military, our patriotism is in question. <p>But then an election rolls round and politicians suddenly want to hear from us. Specifically, they want us to send cheques. They also want to sign us up to vote, potentially catapulting them into office over the objections of local folk who know better. </p> <p>We expats are a shadowy group. No studies indicate how many of us exercise our right to vote and no exit polls say whether we lean to the left or right. Curtis Gans, who runs the independent Committee for the Study of the American Electorate, reckons there are about 3.5 million Americans of voting age residing overseas, and that these fall roughly into four main groups: military personnel, government employees, people attached to businesses and students. </p> <p>The student vote varies between years, but Gans predicts students will lean somewhat more than usually towards the Democrats in this election. Those in the military and business tended to vote Republican, he said, though he suspected the military would be slightly less inclined to do so this year. </p> <p>The Democrats have not forgotten the Republican tendency of military voters. In 2000, overseas voters tipped the balance in favour of Bush in Florida, though only in the sense that their votes came in last. Every vote counted - except for those unwittingly drafted into the \"Jews for Buchanan\" lobby, those of black voters disenfranchised by their state officials, and other chads deemed too pregnant or hanging - but both Democrats and Republicans walked away with a mission to sign up the expats for 2004.</p> <p>And the important message is voter registration. The process of applying for an absentee ballot can be somewhat complex, but no matter what corner of the world you may be hiding in, this year a member of the party faithful is probably there, ready and willing to get you that ballot no matter what your party affiliation. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.democratsabroad.org\" target=\"_new\">Democrats Abroad</a> sounds messianic in its drive to sign up as many John Kerry supporters - or least Bush defectors - as it can flush out at screenings of Fahrenheit 9/11 or international outposts of Krispy Kreme. </p> <p>Margo Miller, the Get out the Vote coordinator for Democrats Abroad in the UK, said the memory of Florida was having a powerful effect on recruiting. </p> <p>\"People are really motivated this year, in part because of Florida,\" she said. She said her volunteers had registered 12,000 voters so far this year and she expected to hit 14,000 before the election, double the total for 2000. </p> <p>That figure does not include the 2,000 voters a day she said were signing up via the Democrats Abroad website, <a href=\"http://www.overseasvote2004.com/\">Overseas Vote 2004</a>, which went live after the Democratic convention in July.</p> <p>Over at <a href=\"http://www.republicansabroad.org\" target=\"_new\">Republicans Abroad</a> they have relied in part on the extensive web of Bush family members, shipping them off to expat havens in aid of cousin/uncle/nephew Georgie. </p> <p>The co-chair of Republicans Abroad, Joan Hills, said George P Bush, the president's nephew, had spent three days in Mexico with the Republicans Abroad co-ordinator last month looking to sign up Mexico's large communities of American pensioners and businessmen. Retired people throughout Central America were being targeted by Republican teams as well.</p> <p>Next week the president's aunt, Nancy Bush Ellis, will make a whistle-stop tour through the UK, France and Germany on behalf of Republicans Abroad. Hills said in Europe the voter registration figures were up around 400% on 2000. </p> <p>Why should we vote for them? The Republicans stress their work to secure advantageous tax breaks for Americans living overseas while the Democrats highlight security, suggesting Bush's foreign policy has made the world a more dangerous place for US citizens. </p> <p>American civilians living overseas feel more exposed now than they did at the time of the last election, but that feeling could cut two ways: either they will feel the president's moves represent the best chance for combating the terrorist threat or they will feel he has squandered the goodwill generated by September 11 with unswerving unilateralism on a number of causes. </p> <p>But for military personnel, the change since 2000 is stark: with a war in Afghanistan and US casualties in Iraq passing the 1,000 mark, soldiers are understandably less interested in hearing partisan speeches than a workable plan to win the peace and get them home. John Kael Weston founded Donkeys in the Desert - aka the Iraq chapter of Democrats Abroad - and from his current position, in the Sunni triangle, he said most service personnel were frustrated by the focus on Vietnam coming from both campaigns. </p> <p>\"All this talk of Vietnam service (or non-service) is a bit surreal when you hear it from the vantage point of an all too violent Iraq,\" he said. He was unimpressed with both parties on their record of coming to Iraq and seeing for themselves what is going on, and has invited both John Kerry and John Edwards for tours. Neither has responded. </p> <p>However, he took issue with the prevailing wisdom that everyone in the military is a Republican.</p> <p>\"The kind of military today in Iraq is heavy on reservists and national guard,\" Mr Weston said. \"It's a new dynamic. My sense is that there will be a lot of proxy votes cast this year from the war zones, with military families weighing in with their over-extended family members serving in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere.\"</p> <p>In one sense, though, the overseas military voters would prove far more decisive than their civilian counterparts, Weston said: queues for voter registration were long, and the few statistics that existed suggested members of the military voted in far greater numbers than civilians. </p> <p>\"Soldiers generally take seriously their civic duty, I find. It's too bad more Americans do not, reflected by 50% turnout rates in recent presidential elections.\"</p> <p>Both parties agree that with the election looking like such a close race, overseas voters will play a critical role. </p> <p>\"If it comes down to a fine wire, I would say Republican overseas votes will tip the balance,\" Hills said. </p> <p>Democrats Abroad are afraid of that. \"People have been coming up to us this year and saying, 'I'm so sorry I didn't vote in 2000,'\" Miller said. She will just have to hope her party has found enough voters to register - and that they send back their ballots with the right name on them. </p> <p> <a href=\" http://www.overseasvote2004.com  \" target=\"_new\">overseasvote.com</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.republicansabroad.org\" target=\"_new\">republicansabroad.org</a><br> <a href=\"http://www.democratsabroad.org\" target=\"_new\">democratsabroad.org</a> <br> <a href=\" http://www.fvap.gov/   Federal Voting Assistance Programme \" target=\"_new\">Federal Voting Assistance Programme</a></p>",

  "Ministers were last night considering a ban on demonstrations in Parliament Square and the introduction of armed police to guard the doors of the House of Commons in the wake of the most flagrant breach of parliamentary security in living memory. <p>Five protesters - members of the Countryside Alliance - with clear inside knowledge of the layout of the Commons, stormed the floor of the chamber at 4.20pm yesterday. The intruders had evaded armed police outside parliament and footmen in tights by donning construction suits and using back stairs. </p> <p>Their entry route took them within yards of the offices of cabinet ministers, including the prime minister, Tony Blair, the foreign secretary, Jack Straw, and the home secretary, David Blunkett. </p> <p>There were suggestions that a Tory MP's researcher may have been involved. Questions were also being asked why a door leading to the floor of the Commons that should have been locked had been left open. </p> <p>The group of eight protesters took off their suits in a corridor above the Commons chamber, and then invaded the chamber, shouting at the rural affairs minister, Alun Michael: \"This is is not democracy. This is a denial of democracy.\" </p> <p>Three of the eight protesters, all under arrest last night, were stopped before they reached the chamber. They were arrested for uttering a forged instrument, burglary with intent to commit criminal damage, and violent disorder. </p> <p>Amongst the protesters' discarded clothes was a forged letter claiming that they had been invited to a meeting along the committee room corridor by two MPs, Labour's Kerry Pollard and the Conservative Sir Peter Tapsell. </p> <p>It was revealed last night that members of the protest group had undertaken a dry run on Tuesday. The BBC was made aware of this by the protesters, but failed to report the matter to the parliamentary authorities - an issue that is likely to lead to a row within the BBC, and between the BBC and MPs. One of those arrested was Otis Ferry, a Shropshire huntsman and the son of pop star Bryan Ferry. </p> <p>In a statement last night to MPs, the Speaker, Michael Martin, said he had asked the Metropolitan police to significantly increase its presence in parliament. Mr Martin said it was not clear yet whether a Commons pass holder \"who apparently gave assistance to the intruders\" was a member of staff, a member of the press, or an employee of a MP. </p> <p>\"All these possibilities are being investigated. For tomorrow's sitting I have asked the Metropolitan police to provide a significant additional squad of police officers to be deployed in the immediate vicinity of the chamber until this house rises.\" </p> <p>A spokeswoman for the Commons Authority declined to comment on whether CCTV cameras were in place in corridors around the chamber, where armed police were still on guard last night. </p> <p>The invasion forced a 20-minute suspension of proceedings as stunned MPs assessed the violation of democratic debate. But the protest failed to stop mainly Labour MPs forcing through in one day a bill banning hunting. The vote was 356 to 166 at the bill's second reading. Mr Blair, a previous opponent of fox hunting, did not vote. </p> <p>In the wake of the security lapse, the leader of the Commons, Peter Hain, along with Mr Blunkett, were at meetings last night reviving demands that armed policemen be posted at the six doors leading to the Commons chamber, instead of unarmed badge messengers in tights. </p> <p>Mr Hain is determined to preserve the right of democratic protest within Parliament Square. But both men agree that there should be a powerful single head of security reporting directly to the Serjeant at Arms, Sir Michael Cummins, and his opposite number in the Lords, Black Rod. </p> <p>The two ministers had sought but failed to secure the changes after flour was thrown on the prime minister from the public gallery. One source blamed \"the establishment that runs this building, especially the Serjeant at Arms\". </p> <p>It was also a dramatic day outside the Commons as a minority among thousands of noisy rural protesters in Parliament Square battled with truncheon-wielding police. </p> <p>At one point the anxious Speaker peered through the gates of parliament to see if the police could hold the line, and prevent a mass invasion of its precincts. Police made 15 other arrests during the demonstration, and 17 protesters and two officers were injured. </p> <p>The Countryside Alliance's chairman, John Jackson, condemned \"these lawless activities which are selfish and self-indulgent. However appalling the behaviour of Alun Michael, people should not allow themselves to be provoked into activities of this kind which can only harm the cause for which thousands of their fellows are demonstrating peacefully\". </p> <p>Conservative MPs also condemned the violence unequivocally. </p> <p>Earlier Mr Michael, who has travelled the country putting the case for a compromise solution involving the regulation of hunts under a strict code, faced protests from Tory and some Labour MPs over the use of the Parliament Act to bypass the House of Lords. He told them that it had be come clear \"that the two sides are so polarised ... this is the same bill that came before the house last year and was debated extensively at that time. This issue has been taking up parliament's time year after year and it's an issue that must be brought to a conclusion\". </p> <p>Peers now have just 30 days to decide whether to accept the will of the Commons or see the measure forced onto the statute book without their consent by use of the Parliament Act. </p> <p>With the Countryside Alliance intent on taking legal action against the government on the grounds that use of the Parliament Act to fast-track legislation breaches the European convention on human rights, Mr Michael said ministers were confident any attempt to invoke the convention would fail. </p> <p>He said the government had tried to get a dialogue between supporters and opponents of hunting. But, time and again, the Lords had vetoed legislation, and Labour's last manifesto had made clear that if the upper house continued to block the Commons \"we will look at how it can be resolved\". </p> <p>The Tory rural affairs spokesman, Oliver Heald, accused ministers of using \"draconian powers\", and of indecision over the past seven years. \"They've started and checked, they've jinked and dived, they've been up hill and down dale ... now they say it's a matter of such serious importance it must be dealt with now.\" </p> <p>At question time in the Commons, Michael Howard taunted the prime minister, accusing him of making hunting a priority above issues of more pressing importance. \"When are you going to get to grips with the problems people really care about?\" he asked. </p> <p>Some Labour backbenchers were also sceptical. Barry Sheerman criticised bypassing the Lords in order to drive through the legislation. \"Surely this is hardly the issue to use the Parliament Act ... in order to overrule not only the House of Lords but also to steam roller this through against a very large minority that don't want it.\" </p> <p>For the Liberal Democrats, Andrew George maintained the debate was about \"who runs the country. Is it based on primogeniture and birthright - what one might describe as the old boy network, or it is run on the basis of democracy?\" </p> <p>The veteran leftwinger Dennis Skinner accused opponents of the bill of \"whingeing and whining ... tell the House of Lords to go to hell and that we'll carry the bill\".</p>",
  "A row between Russia and America over Moscow's response to the Beslan tragedy escalated yesterday when George Bush voiced concern that a sweeping Kremlin security overhaul \"could undermine democracy\". <p>Hours after Russia warned Washington not to meddle in its internal affairs, Mr Bush expressed disquiet at moves by his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, to fight Chechen terrorism by amassing more power for himself. </p> <p>\"As governments fight the enemies of democracy, they must uphold the principles of democracy,\" the president said. \"I'm ... concerned about the decisions that are being made in Russia that could undermine democracy.\" </p> <p>His remarks hinted at US unease that Mr Putin could use the \"war on terror\" to roll back post-Soviet reform. </p> <p>Mr Putin's chief initiative in response to the carnage at Beslan, blamed on Chechen militants, has involved abolishing elections for both constituency MPs and regional governors, and appointing the latter himself. </p> <p>Mr Bush warned: \"Great democracies have a balance of power between central gov ernments and local governments, a balance of power within central governments between the executive branch and the legislative branch and the judicial branch.\" </p> <p>The issue is the biggest diplomatic spat between Russia and the US for four years, in which relations between Mr Putin and Mr Bush have been relatively good. </p> <p>But when Colin Powell, the US secretary of state accused the Kremlin earlier yesterday of \"pulling back on some democratic reforms\", it drew a sharp riposte from Sergei Lavrov, Russia's foreign minister. \"The processes that are under way in Russia are our internal affair,\" he said. </p> <p>Although Mr Powell's rebuke was relatively mild, the Russian government is not in the mood to accept such criticism so soon after the Beslan atrocity, in which 320 people died, half of them children. </p> <p>Mr Lavrov said the US had no right to impose its model of democracy. \"And it is at least strange that, while talking about a certain 'pulling back', as he [Powell] put it, on some of the democratic reforms in the Russian Federation, he tried to assert yet one more time the thought that democracy can only be copied from someone's model,\" Mr Lavrov said, adding pointedly, in view of the outcome of the US 2000 election: \"We, for our part, do not comment on the US system of presidential elections, for instance.\" He also pointed to repressive measures after September 11. The US introduced a homeland security law that reversed previous legal rights, and had held hundreds at Guant\u00e1namo Bay in Cuba and the Bagram airbase in Afghanistan for more than two years without trial. </p> <p>The outgoing EU commissioner, Chris Patten, was more outspoken than the US, telling the European parliament yesterday that a resolution of the Chechen conflict lay in far-sighted and humane policies, rather than in reversing democracy. He hoped \"the government of the Russian Federation will not conclude that the only answer to terrorism is to increase the power of the Kremlin\". </p> <p>The British government has studiously stayed out of the row. The Foreign Office decided last week to postpone its annual report due to be published today, which would have been highly critical of human rights in Chechnya. </p> <p>The foreign secretary, Jack Straw, has so far refused to comment on the changes in Russia. Asked on the BBC last week, he said it was inappropriate so soon after Beslan.</p>",
  "<b>Financial Times</b> <br> Editorial, September 15 <p>\"Predictions of the potentially dire effects of climate change pile up, not least from Tony Blair. [Tuesday's] warning from the prime minister ... came not only as competition for the green vote in next year's election heats up but also as the season for Caribbean hurricanes, a long-standing phenomenon that could none the less be aggravated by global warming, is under way. </p> <p>\"Yet it is hard to see many other leaders joining Mr Blair in giving high priority to the reduction of greenhouse gases ... Compliancy is widespread ... None the less ... he intended to use his chairmanship next year of [the G8 group of industrialised countries] to try to get progress on climate change. A first step would be acceptance of the scientific evidence in which President George Bush, notably, refuses to believe.\" </p> <p><b>Michael Hanlon</b><br> Daily Mail, September 15 </p> <p>\"When it comes to climate change, evidence counts for little and emotion counts for all ... There is no doubt that the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in our atmosphere has risen in the past century, and there is little doubt, too, that human activities are to blame ... In any case, our dependency on fossil fuels, particularly for the production of electricity, is getting mankind into all sorts of trouble ... </p> <p>\"If Mr Blair really is planning a revival in nuclear power - which, despite the misguided hysteria, is by far the safest and greenest form of generating power - such a policy would be to his credit.\" </p> <p><b>Simon Jenkins</b><br> Times, September 15 </p> <p>\"Mr Blair clearly regards the Earth's temperature as yet another public service in the portfolio of Her Majesty's government ... If they really believe in the apocalypse, only one technology is currently available to hold it at bay and that is nuclear power ... So did Mr Blair couple his predictions of doom with plans for a new generation of nuclear stations to replace those being decommissioned after 2008? No, he did not ... He is standing by his pledge to cut Britain's CO&lt;-&gt;2 <!----> emissions by 20% by 2012 and increase to 20% over 15 years the renewables component in Britain's generating mix ... [But] Mr Blair has no way of meeting these targets ...

Global warming is no joke. But the problem is that ... for today's giant turbines, anything below 8mph and much above 50mph is no good. As a result, their output is intermittent and volatile. That means we still need back-up from traditional sources for power ... Ironically, the effect of expanding wind power capacity is therefore to decrease the efficiency with which we run our fossil-fuel stations, which have to go on standby when the wind is just right.\" </p> <p><b>Lord May</b><br> Daily Telegraph, September 15  </p> <p>\"Nuclear power is an unpopular child of the energy family ... But we should not be afraid to point out that, as an energy source, it is relatively 'climate-friendly' [and] as such, should be given serious consideration. Keeping the nuclear option open should not be seen as a trade-off with support for renewable energy. Britain must do a better job of reaching its targets for renewables and reducing the wasteful use of energy. And there is security in a diversity of supply. In the short to medium term, it is difficult to see how we can reduce our dependence on fossil fuels without the help of nuclear power ... </p> <p>\"Given that it takes about 10 years from the commissioning of a nuclear power station to it providing electricity, Britain would need to start building significant nuclear capacity, taking full advantage of the technical advances that have taken place elsewhere in the world while we have turned our backs on this technology.\"</p>",
  "<b>\u00b7</b> You will recall that the Diary's very own brand new conspiracy theory (which held that Kerry's tanking presidential campaign was a deliberate Democratic feint aimed at giving Hillary Clinton a clear run in 2008) was rather anticipated by those crazy rightwing nerds at <a href=\"http://www.freerepublic.com\">freerepublic.com</a>, who had already posted several threads to that effect before we could bestir ourselves to come up with a username and password. In fact, much of the internet-friendly hard right seems to believe that Hillary is working diligently for a Bush victory by supplying the Kerry campaign with forged documents. You have to get up pretty early to outflank these guys, even factoring in the time difference. <p><b>\u00b7</b> Undaunted, the Diary joined freerepublic.com under the pseudonym weknowthistobetrue (a hasty truncation of the more Jeffersonian weholdthesetruthstobeselfevident, which exceeds the 30-character limit by two), posting a thread that took the conspiracy to its logical conclusion - that a vote for Bush in 2004 was a vote for Hillary in 2008 - and asking if true conservatives shouldn't seriously consider voting for Kerry to prevent such an unhappy executive outcome. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> \"Should you blow your head off because eventually you will die anyway?\" is just one of nine comments to appear within two minutes of our thread going live. Proper debate at last! But before we could type back \"Shouldn't you be in school, sonny?\", we received another, terser, message: \"This thread has been pulled.\" Efforts to reword the appeal were met with a further stumbling block: \"This account,\" read the notice, \"has been banned or suspended.\" Come, come. Which is it? </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Who says the power of the printed press is waning? Only last Thursday, on these very pages, John Harris complained that Mercury-prize-winning art-popsters Franz Ferdinand were depressingly conservative, overly polite and \"terrifyingly well-adjusted\". Not everybody would take umbrage at that, but Franz Ferdinand frontman (try saying that after a good lunch) Alex Kapranos self-evidently did. In an interview in Time Out next week - yes, you are hearing it here first, unless Time Out emailed you the pdf file yesterday as well - Kapranos expressed his typically measured concerns. \"That's quite offensive,\" he said. Nevertheless, he seems to have taken the criticism on board: \"But, hey, if that writer wants obnoxiousness, I'll call him a fanny and punch him in the face.\" Swearing properly takes practice, young man, but otherwise, well done. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> The Diary is intrigued to hear that the new Conservative chair of the London Assembly, Brian Coleman, has taken to turning up at the assembly wearing the heavy gold chain and official regalia of the chairman of the old Greater London Council, which can't have had much of an airing since the Tories abolished the GLC in 1986. Perhaps those old wounds have healed at last. What a great way to symbolise the new spirit of consensus that informs the governance of the capital. Unless he's just taking the fanny. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Meanwhile, in the short time since the well-meaning, if intensely paranoid, folks at freerepublic.com summarily violated the Diary's first amendment rights, reader Geoff Taylor is in touch to say that yesterday he too signed up at freerepublic.com and had his \"posting privileges\" revoked after only a quarter of an hour. Hmm.

  "The storming of the floor of parliament was not a spur-of-the-moment act of protest, but part of an elaborate and well-planned move, involving the son of a rock star, a dummy run the day before, bogus letters and the clothes of construction contractors. <p>The BBC and, possibly, other news organisations were tipped off about the plans the day before, and yet, extraordinarily, no one told parliament's limited security forces. </p> <p>It now appears that the group of eight hunters, many members of the Countryside Alliance and including Otis Ferry, the son of former Roxy Music star Brian Ferry, had planned this invasion of democracy for days. </p> <p>The big question is how they were given so much knowledge about the layout of the building, the best corridor by corridor access route to the chamber and how to lie their way into relevant areas of the Commons. Someone told the group that the select committee corridor floor was in a state of reconstruction and that they should pretend they were going to a committee meeting as construction workers. Allegations that the culprit was a researcher of a prominent Tory MP were denied by the Tories last night. </p> <p>The group arrived as white-collar construction workers, armed with a forged letter suggesting they had been asked to a meeting on construction by two MPs, Kerry Pollard and Sir Peter Tapsell. Neither MP had any knowledge of the letter, but Mr Pollard does have a construction background, so someone with a good inside take suggested using Mr Pollard's name. </p> <p>With the Commons closed to lobbyists, the group lied their way past unsuspecting police, and scanners. They reached the normally readily accessible select committee corridor and went into one of the rooms to take off their construction clothes, revealing anti-hunt ban white T-shirts, before rushing down a little-known staircase that took them to the back of Speaker's chair and a means of access to the chamber. </p> <p>The area should be one of the most protected in Westminster since most senior Cabinet ministers have offices in the immediate vicinity. It appears that a door that should have been accessible only with a swipe card available to Commons staff had been left open by the police, partly to make it easier for MPs to rush to a vote. </p> <p>The first signs that the Westminster protest as MPs voted to ban hunting was going to be something other than routine came mid-afternoon, when hundreds of demonstrators surged against lines of baton-wielding police. Within minutes, bloodied protesters were pitted against officers in riot gear, in scenes that could have come from the 1980s miners' strike. </p> <p>Police helicopters hovered low over the Treasury building beside Parliament Square, and a folk singer on the platform had just finished his refrain: \"Fight, fight for your rights, the war has begun\", when the first thunderflash was thrown. </p> <p>There was a rush towards the police and a barrage of objects was hurled, including old sandwiches and plastic bottles, causing officers to draw their batons. </p> <p>More explosions followed, caused by crow scarers and fireworks. Placards were hurled. Officers struck out at a small section of the crowd trying to push through to the House of Commons. </p> <p>Some protesters were arrested and dragged away. Others staggered back, blood pouring from their heads. </p> <p>Seventeen-year-old Sam Owen, from Pontypool in south Wales, with blood streaming down the side of his face, said: \"I was six or seven rows back but the police came out and hit us.\" Stink bombs and coloured smoke canisters were thrown as officers brought out riot shields and wielded batons. Shotgun cartridges, loaded only with powder, were detonated, adding to the cacophony of blaring horns and whistles. </p> <p>\"A lot of people are going to lose their jobs and their hounds,\" said Alison Auvray, from Lambourn, Berkshire. \"There are a lot of people who felt very strongly.\" </p> <p>Then suddenly, just after 4pm, the focus switched to the floor of the Commons, where the debate on the hunting bill was nearing its conclusion. </p> <p>Eight protesters were already inside the Palace of Westminster by then, making their way, apparently unnoticed and unchecked until the last moment, through the maze of corridors leading over and around the chamber. </p> <p>Westminster security sources said they approached their target from the committee corridor - a long passage running the entire length of the palace from Lords to Commons above the chambers of the two houses. </p> <p>The first protester stood alongside the Opposition frontbench, gesturing and shouting across the despatch box at the rural affairs minister, Alun Michael, as another three protesters ran in after him, shouting pro-hunting slogans. </p> <p>A fifth ran down the No lobby, turned back and burst in at the other end of the chamber, pursued by security staff in tailcoats, one carrying a ceremonial stick. </p> <p>A tussle compared by one observer with the \"Keystone cops\" followed, amid shouts of \"get out\" from Labour MPs, and deputy speaker Sylvia Heal suspended the sitting. </p> <p>\"This looks like an inside job,\" one former minister said last night. \"Even if they found a route that didn't require a pass to open doors, they would have needed someone to lead them.\"</p>"
