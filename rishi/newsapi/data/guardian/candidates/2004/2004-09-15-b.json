  "Pakistan's president, General Pervez Musharraf, yesterday reneged on a promise to stand down as army chief at the end of the year. <p>In a setback for Pakistan's transition from military government to democracy, Gen Musharraf decided to remain both president and chief of staff, though there was no suggestion that he would retain the military position indefinitely. </p> <p>\"The president has decided to keep both offices, of the president and the army chief, beyond December 31,\" the information minister, Sheikh Rashid Ahmed, said. </p> <p>Asked why the decision to step down, announced last December, had been reversed, Sheikh Ahmed said: \"The situation has changed.\" </p> <p>Gen Musharraf had been preparing the ground for his decision by dropping hints in the media. </p> <p>He took power in a coup in 1999 and initially was treated as a pariah by many countries, including the UK. But his support for the US in the war against terrorism, especially the removal of the Taliban in Afghanistan, saw him restored to favour in Washington, London and other capitals. </p> <p>Although he restored parliamentary elections in 2002, he has the power to depose the prime minister and dissolve the parliament. </p> <p>The Foreign Office said last night that the change of heart had to be seen as part of a wider picture: \"Our view is that the separation of the role of president and the chief of army staff will be an important element of the transition [to democracy],\" a spokesman said. But he added: \"We recognise it will take time for democratic politics to take root.\" </p> <p>Pakistan's opposition leaders denounced Gen Musharraf as a dictator. He promised to give up his army post last December after he came under pressure from opposition groups calling for the country to adopt stricter Islamist policies. </p> <p>The Commonwealth automatically slapped a ban on Pakistan after the coup. The country only won a return to full membership before the summer.</p>",
  "<p>Plans were announced yesterday for a \u00a350m leisure complex in the West Midlands which could create more than 3,000 jobs. </p> <p>The development at Brierley Hill is backed by Australian billionaire Kerry Packer and British entrepreneur Damian Aspinall. </p> <p>Subject to planning permission, it will include eight restaurants, a 1,000-seat theatre, a skills training facility and a gaming complex. </p> <p>The attraction, next to the Merry Hill shopping centre and near leisure facilities at the Waterfront area, could be operational by 2007. </p> <p>The Aspinall Packer Group, based in Knightsbridge, London, is a partnership between the Aspinall group and Consolidated Press Holdings - Mr Packer's private company. Both are involved internationally in leisure, entertainment and gaming. </p> <p>Mr Aspinall said: \"The complex will create jobs for over 1,000 local people in a range of employment categories from waiting staff to accounting and marketing. We estimate that the complex will create a further 2,000 indirect and induced jobs.\" </p> <p>The complex, which includes proposals for an 80-bed hotel and new homes, would be built on land owned by property group Chelsfield which manages the Merry Hill centre and would act as overall developer. </p> <p>The Brierley Hill complex is one of an intended portfolio of 12 to 16 APG sites across the country.</p>",
  "<b>\u00b7</b> It may have been hatched at four in the morning during a bout of feverish insomnia, but when you think about it, it all fits: John Kerry's transparent failure to be even a little bit likeable and his seeming inability to launch a smear counter-offensive without it backfiring are obviously deliberate, part of a complex plot hatched by the vast leftwing conspiracy. They figure, probably rightly, that GWB has saved his biggest evil schemes for a second term, and have deliberately sacrificed Kerry in order to give the Bush White House time to mire itself in scandal, ideally with everybody being led away in handcuffs just as Hillary Clinton throws her hat into the ring. If you've never tried before, these conspiracy theories might look difficult to produce but, honestly, they're not. Contrary to the Littlejohn Postulate, you really can just make it up. <p><b>\u00b7</b> The hard work over, the only question is where to hold the official launch. It's off to freerepublic.com, the website of record for troubled loners and assault-weapons enthusiasts alike, and a place where a hastily cobbled together conspiracy theory can always find an appreciative audience. But what's this? Someone, or rather several people, appear to have got there ahead of the Diary: \"Could Memo forgery be a setup for Hillary camp for '08? (conspiracy theory)\" is the title of one thread which has been up and running since Friday, attracting 36 replies (\"I don't think it's crazy at all. My husband and I talked about it last night\"). How galling. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> According to this variation, recently unearthed documents casting doubt on the young George Bush's sincere commitment to his National Guard duty are actually crude forgeries designed to discredit Kerry, created by Hillary supporters keen to secure a Bush victory. A bit over-complicated, perhaps, but all the basic elements are there, bar our proposed slogan, \"A vote for Bush in 2004 is a vote for Hillary in 2008\". This calls for a new corollary to the Littlejohn Postulate, something along the lines of: \"You could have made it up, if only you'd been a bit quicker off the mark.\" We haven't given up. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> From the Goole Times: \"An Iraqi psychiatrist from Airmyn would pray to Allah whenever he cheated on his wife with a lesbian patient, a medical tribunal heard this week.\" Clearly two, if not three, separate news stories have been accidentally conflated in some kind of computer glitch. Or is it a bawdy limerick which has been poorly translated from another language? Is Hillary one of the principals? You decide. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Surveillance: diminutive Tory MP Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, trying to board an easyJet flight from Luton to Inverness, armed with salmon rods and a Daily Mail in a Conservative party plastic bag, but without proper photo identification. Instead he tried proffering his work ID, which everybody knows just isn't good enough. \"It's a parliamentary pass,\" he kept saying. \"I'm a member of parliament.\" In what amounts to a stunning lapse of security, they let him on anyway. Do they think the terrorists are all going to wear al-Qaida T-shirts? </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Another thread appears at freerepublic.com: \"Did Hillary Clinton give Dan Rather forged docs to sink Kerry?\" The ball is well and truly rolling now. One more, and it's true. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> The local paper in Peter Mandelson's former constituency of Hartlepool has announced that the ex-MP will leave behind a legacy in the form of an award for \"children who have worked particularly hard in their education\". Nothing else is yet known about the award, except that it will be in Mandelson's name, will include a small cash prize and \"will be made of glass\". I mean, can you wait? </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:diary@theguardian.com\">diary@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Florida and Jeb Bush, the president's brother, were once more at the centre of a legal row over the presidential election yesterday, after Governor Bush's administration intervened to ensure Ralph Nader was on the state ballot. <p>Florida Democrats, fearing Mr Nader will take votes away from them, accused the state government of flouting a court order last Wednesday that removed the third party candidate and veteran consumer activist from the ballot, on the grounds that the group sponsoring him, the Reform party, was not a nationally recognised party. </p> <p>Mr Nader's lawyers challenged the verdict but his name remained off the state ballot pending the appeal. However, Governor Bush's secretary of state, Glenda Hood, has stepped in and submitted her own appeal which automatically suspended the court order, putting Mr Nader back in the running just in time for absentee ballots to be posted to 50,000 US soldiers and other overseas voters by a Saturday deadline. </p> <p>\"This is blatant political manoeuvring by Jeb Bush to give his brother a leg-up on election day,\" the Florida Democratic party's chairman, Scott Maddox, said. \"And it's just plain wrong.\" </p> <p>Once Mr Nader's name was on absentee ballots, the state government would use the fact to strengthen the case to include it on all ballots across Florida on election day, Mr Maddox claimed. </p> <p>Democrats also pointed out that Mr Nader's campaign had hired a Republican lawyer, Kenneth Sukhia, who worked for Mr Bush in the dramatic 2000 election recount, as proof that the Bush White House was conniving in Nader's efforts to get on to the ballot. </p> <p>Democratic outrage was fuelled when Ms Hood's office blamed Hurricane Ivan, which is bearing down on the Gulf of Mexico coast, for its unusual intervention on behalf of a third party candidate. </p> <p>A hearing on the case had been scheduled for tomorrow, but the state elections director Dawn Roberts claimed that Ivan might make that hearing impossible, and potentially deny Mr Nader's right to be on the ballot. </p> <p>\"There remains a substantial question as to when such a hearing on the permanent injunction will be held, considering the track of Hurricane Ivan,\" Ms Roberts argued in a memorandum to county election supervisors who had just ordered new ballots printed without Mr Nader's name. </p> <p>Hundreds of thousands of Americans were being evacuated yesterday from a swath of the Gulf Coast from Louisiana to the Florida panhandle in the west of the state, in anticipation of the hurricane as it moved north-west out of the Caribbean. </p> <p>Ms Hood denied that the state government was taking sides, but simply intervening to ensure that nobody's democratic rights were infringed. </p> <p>\"We are acting as an honest broker,\" the Florida secretary of state said </p> <p>Governor Bush's administration was the focus of complaints in 2000, when thousands of black Floridians were removed from electoral lists because they were wrongly classified as former felons without voting rights. </p> <p>Ms Hood's predecessor, Katherine Harris, was also attacked by Democrats at the time for summarily rejecting their appeals against the first vote count, and certifying the initial results which gave the state, and the presidency, to George Bush. </p> <p>After five weeks of legal wrangling, the US supreme court weighed in and awarded the election, by a one-vote majority to Mr Bush. </p> <p>This year, the state is being carefully scrutinised for its conduct of the election, and was recently forced to abandon the use of another felons list that was found to be faulty. Democrats and civil rights activists have pointed towards the use this year of computer voting as a possible new source of errors and fraud. </p> <p>Mr Nader won 97,000 votes in Florida four years ago as the Green party candidate, when Mr Bush was declared to have clinched the election by a margin of only 537 over Al Gore. However, some polls this year have suggested he would draw no more votes away from John Kerry than from President Bush.</p>",
  "<p>We must assume that Tom Maheras, the name at the top of the extraordinary memorandum from Citigroup on its summer antics in the bond markets, expected his words of contrition to leak. </p> <p>He cannot have expected absolute, uniform loyalty among the many thousands employed by \"Global Corporate and Investment Banking\", even if it is the all-powerful Citigroup. </p> <p>In which case we should treat this memo as a public apology - a full admission that the bank's casual manipulation of the markets was wrong. </p> <p>It is also an admission of astonishing incompetence. Consider the bald facts: one morning in early August a Citigroup trader, Spiros Skordos, was able to play around with about \u00a37bn of the bank's money while seemingly ignoring the \"impact on our clients, other market participants and our regulators\". </p> <p>To put that in some sort of context, it was the equivalent of a bank selling BSkyB and then buying the business back a couple of minutes later and booking a profit of about 0.1%, or \u00a37m, in the process. </p> <p>Citigroup is the product of too many banking mergers to mention. While falling well short of monopoly status, its sheer size means it wields astonishing financial power. It dwarfs almost all its clients. The unregulated trading it conducts with clients and counterparties of all shapes and sizes, known as over-the-counter business, is far bigger than any formal stock, bond or commodity exchange on the planet. </p> <p>But it is still reliant on its reputation. After its battles with Eliot Spitzer on Wall Street, Enron, WorldCom, yesterday's run-in with Japanese regulators and now Mr Skordos' antics, that reputation is looking rather tarnished. </p> <p><strong> On the fence </strong><br> </p> <p> At first hearing, Steve Nickell's speech on the housing market yesterday sounded typical of a two-handed economist: on the one hand, house prices could fall; on the other, they might not. </p> <p>Small wonder that former American president Harry S Truman famously begged for a one-handed economist who might actually tell him what would happen instead of forever sitting on the fence. But in the long tradition of trying to tease meaning from the oblique language of central bankers, we reckon Professor Nickell, one of the key members of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, was actually being rather clear. </p> <p>Mark his words: there is a \"significant probability\" that house prices will fall while it remains only \"quite possible\" that they would not. For a two-handed economist, that's a pretty straightforward statement. </p> <p>This is a strong echo of Bank of England governor Mervyn King's warning on house prices back in June - and the language in which it is couched simply highlights the Bank's dilemma. </p> <p>If Nickell et al are too aggressive in warning that house prices might crash, crash, they almost certainly will. And yet the monetary policy committee simply cannot stand by while a market bubble grows to increasingly dangerous proportions. </p> <p>They may or may not succeed in engineering the much hoped for \"soft landing\". But in the meantime these direct forays into the market can only be causing angst across town at HM Treasury. </p> <p>With an election looming, house price jitters are the last thing the chancellor needs. </p> <p><strong> F-brand values </strong><br> </p> <p> So is FCUK fcuked? Yesterday, French Connection, which until recently represented the nearest the high street had to an edgy yet mass market brand, revealed a 60% decline in operating profit at its UK shops and like-for-like sales down 9.5% - when they were roaring ahead by 11% same time last year. </p> <p>Founder, chairman and 42% shareholder Stephen Marks insists there is nothing wrong with the brand and that the dismal summer was to blame. That would be the same summer that left Next almost completely unscathed, we take it ... </p> <p>Until recently FCUK was just a riot. Judges expelling jurors sporting the brand on their t-shirts, banned TV ads, tabloid columnists railing against the obscenity of the F-brand. Mr Marks was in heaven. </p> <p>Now, however, the entire concept is looking a little F-rayed. The four letters are being dropped from new ads. Drapers Record, the bible of fashion retail, has described it as a \"tired and tacky\" label. </p> <p>Brand consultants are lining up to say it is now about as cool as Aled Jones. </p> <p>History is littered with once hot labels which swiftly turned old and cold. </p> <p>Think fashion (Joe Bloggs, Benetton), food (Blue Nun, Ferrero Rocher), music (Capital Radio, New Kids on the Block) or publishing (The Face) - life is just littered with must-have names that are suddenly just plain pants. </p> <p>Frankly, we are not surprised that the demise has started this summer. Mr Marks sold a sackful of shares - to finance his divorce - back in June, and it has been downhill ever since for the share price. </p> <p>The shares he sold for \u00a336m are now worth \u00a328m. </p> <p>He obviously remains confident his brand is just suffering a blip, but it is just uncanny how these things coincide.</p>",

  "For supporters of John Kerry, who have seen allegations about the Democratic candidate's military record sap his campaign, it must have seemed like a case of just deserts. <p>The president, George Bush, was last week looking vulnerable on the same grounds after CBS's flagship current affairs show, 60 Minutes, broadcast a report claiming he had been suspended from pilot duties for failing to meet the required standards. It was also claimed that a commanding officer had been put under pressure to \"sugar coat\" Mr Bush's performance reviews.</p> <p>But while CBS stands by its story, allegations have now surfaced that 60 Minutes based a large part of the report on forged <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/htdocs/politics/campaign2004/military.html\">documents</a>.</p> <p>Although what one man - even a presidential candidate - did more than 30 years ago can seem rather trivial, the US election is being fought between a self-declared \"war president\" and a man who, in stump speeches, claims he would defend his country as president in the way he had defended it as a young man. The battleground is Vietnam.</p> <p>The broad facts are relatively simple: Mr Bush was awarded a place in the Texas national air guard, allowing him to avoid the draft, while Mr Kerry volunteered for service in south-east Asia and won medals, including one for gallantry.</p> <p>However, the arguments lie in the details. Mr Kerry's poll ratings suffered as the Republican-linked Swift Boat Veterans for Truth publicised their contested claims that he had not deserved his medals. The CBS report followed a month later.</p> <p>Its detractors argue that what the station presented as the personal files of Lieutenant Colonel Jerry Killian, Mr Bush's squad commander, had been produced using word processor technology unavailable in the early 70s but relatively common today.</p> <p>The telltale sign, it is alleged, is that the CBS documents make use of a small 'th' that Microsoft Word turns those letters into if they are inserted after a number. </p> <p>Font types and spacing patterns also appear to resemble the style of a word processor more than the kind of typewriter the US military would have been using in 1972 or 1973, the detractors say, arguing that, although the technology existed, it was not commonly used for memos.</p> <p>A post on the <a href=\"http://www.freerepublic.com/home.htm\">Free Republic</a> weblog, which did much to interest mainstream news organisations about the possibility of the documents being fakes, read: \"I am saying these documents are forgeries, run through a copier for 15 generations to make them look old.\"</p> <p>Like the revelations about racist remarks that forced Trent Lott, the leader of the Republican majority in the US senate, to resign earlier this year, the criticism of the CBS report has been a blog-driven affair. <a href=\"http://www.littlegreenfootballs.com/weblog/weblog.php\">Little Green Footballs</a>, <a href=\"http://www.powerlineblog.com/\">Power Line</a> and Free Republic - all of which could be described as rightwing - have been the main players.</p> <p>Since then, specialists consulted by CBS have weighed in with conflicting assessments of the documents' authenticity. Killian's secretary, Marian Carr Knox, gave an interview saying she certainly did not type them, but they echoed the officer's thoughts on Mr Bush. </p> <p>Frank Abangale, the master forger played by Leonardo Di Caprio in Catch Me If You Can, told the New York Post the film would been called Catch Me In Two Days if his work had been as bad.</p> <p>CBS now prefaces its <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/09/08/60II/main641984.shtml\">online version of the report</a> with a statement that the report \"was not based solely on recovered documents, but rather on a preponderance of evidence\" including interviews with Texas national air guard officials who worked closely with Killian and were well acquainted with his procedures, character and thinking.</p> <p>The documents also claim Mr Bush refused orders to take a physical examination and was appealing to more senior officers than Killian to get his requests heard.</p> <p>60 Minutes does not have a reputation for irresponsible journalism - it was the show that first broadcast the now notorious photographs of prisoner abuse at the Abu Ghraib jail in Iraq - and it takes the reliability of its stories seriously. </p> <p>The CBS news president, Andrew Heyward, told the Baltimore Sun he had confidence in the story and it was appropriately vetted, but conceded it was a \"political hot potato\". </p> <p>Mr Bush's service record has long been a source of political attacks and, earlier this year, the White House was forced to release records revealing a possible gap in his service for five months in mid-1972 to tame some of the wilder allegations. However, claims that the influence of his father, then a Texas congressman, had saved him from the draft have never gone away. </p> <p>Ben Barnes, then the Democratic speaker of the Texas House of Representatives - now a Kerry supporter - told 60 Minutes in the same report that he had used his connections to help Mr Bush into the air guard after an approach from a Bush family friend. \"I was a young, ambitious politician doing what I thought was acceptable,\" he told the show. \"It was important to make friends.\"</p> <p>Killian cannot make such a comment on the record. He died in 1984 and will never be able to either prove that he wrote the documents, or confirm they are fakes.</p>",
  "Five sailors have been rescued off the coast of Cornwall after spending eight days in a life raft, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency said today. <p>After a five-day rescue operation had failed to find the stranded crew, they were finally picked up by the Falmouth coastguard after one was able to make a 999 call on a mobile phone this morning. </p> <p>The sailors had been forced to abandon their sinking boat in stormy conditions, before setting fire to it in the vain hope of attracting the attention of potential rescuers. Today, they were able to get close enough to the shore to obtain mobile phone reception.</p> <p>An agency spokeswoman said the five were from an Irish-registered boat that had left County Kerry bound for Cherbourg, France nine days ago. </p> <p>The journey should have taken five days but, a day after setting off, the boat - a 60ft trawler converted into a leisure craft called the Inis Mil - began to take in water after the pump broke down.</p> <p>In increasingly choppy seas, the boat's two small emergency pumps were unable to keep out the water, and radio distress signals were not picked up. On the second day of being stranded, after a trawler had passed by but failed to respond to an emergency flare, the crew were forced to man the life raft.</p> <p>They took emergency provisions before setting fire to the sinking boat, hoping that the smoke would be seen by passing boats or rescue teams.</p> <p>However, the alarm was only raised three days later when they failed to arrive at their destination on the scheduled day or make contact with maritime authorities.</p> <p>A major search operation was launched, involving English, Irish, French and Channel islands authorities, but no sign was found of the vessel or its crew until the English skipper made the emergency call at 9.18am today.</p> <p>The life raft was located by a helicopter off Trevose Head, and the five sailors - including the boat's French female owner and the skipper and his son - were taken to the Royal Cornwall hospital, in Treliske.</p> <p>A spokeswoman for the Maritime and Coastguard Agency said the survivors had yet to be questioned about the events leading up to today's rescue operation.</p> <p>\"It is an amazing survival story,\" she added. \"They were on the life raft in extremely choppy conditions and were blown to the west, then to the north, and finally back south until they at last saw land and paddled towards it and managed to get a mobile signal. They didn't have signal before, so they couldn't use mobile.\"</p> <p>An RNLI spokeswoman added that the survivors appeared to be suffering from hypothermia and were \"very hungry but not too badly off\" considering the circumstances. </p> <p>Falmouth's coastguard watch manager, Martin Bidmead, said they were fortunate to be alive. \"Considering the weather conditions over the past week, we consider these survivors to be very lucky,\" he added. \"No distress alert was received from the vessel prior to the mobile telephone call.\"</p>",
  "I have just about had it with the voting vaginas. <p>That was the sentiment running through my head -- for nearly three hours -- on Monday night, during the Vaginas Vote, Chicks Rock concert held at Harlem's Apollo Theatre. The event was planned and sponsored by Rock the Vote, Planned Parenthood, the White House Project and of course V-Day, that vulva-licious organization headed up by Eve Ensler and her blessed freaking vagina. </p> <p>My fidgety exasperation was emblematic of my growing ambivalence about this political season's mass pander to the women's rights movement. In case you've been holed up in PBS's Colonial House, here's the story: A very tight presidential election is upon the United States, and some rocket scientist-pollsters have stumbled upon the fact that American women feel alienated from the country's male-dominated, combat-heavy, healthcare-light political agenda. If we voted in huge numbers - which we've been allowed to do for 84 years but have sort of given up on in recent decades - women could decide the election. </p> <p>The results of this discovery have prompted both parties to bombard us with enough statistics, action-plans, celebrity spokespeople and revolting \"You Go Girl!\" sloganeering to choke an aging riot grrrl. We've been addressed by the earnest Kerry girls and the giggly Bush colts, bland Laura and spicy Teresa. Sarah Jessica Parker wears an in-joke \"Kerry\" nameplate necklace, while Angie Harmon totally intends to vote. The Republican \"W Stands for Women\" campaign rests on the theory that because George Bush is pussy-whipped by a wife and two daughters, he understands women's issues better than his opponent. </p> <p>And here at the Apollo, the argument seemed to hinge on a bunch of women slithering around the stage with swaths of red fabric doing interpretive dances about their hooches and saying things like \"It's not a voting box, it's a cauldron ... stir it well, sister\". That's what Ensler's Vagina Warriors were doing Monday night: undulating and moaning darkly about places to bury their daughters' afterbirths and imagining a world in which they are \"forever unafraid of being raped by the clean-cutting bulldozers of capitalism.\" \"I have no more tears to weep,\" said one of the dancers. </p> <p>I could not agree more. Except that my frustrated, disappointed, fearful tears are not just about the way the world is being run into the ground by the current administration, but about the way my sisters have decided to respond. Maybe it's just overexposure: I've heard so much about the 22 million single women who didn't vote in the last election and the 50 million eligible gals who are still not registered that all the numbers are blurring. And so are the celebrity faces. I can't tell Rosario Dawson from Kathleen Turner, Toni Childs from Julia Stiles. </p> <p>But that's not good news. Because I am a young woman, a single young urban woman, I am the person who must be reached, who must be inspired to go out and cast my ballot. They shouldn't even have to work that hard to get me, since as Julia Roberts once reassured Richard Gere, \"I'm a sure thing\". Long steeped in feminism, engaged in politics, I spent my youth wishing for the kind of cohesive feminist movement that had preceded me. Women need to vote - this year and every year. Enfranchisement is a process that needs to be worked on, worked out, hammered into us. Women's rights are so powerfully under-attended to, so frequently ignored, that it really does sometimes make me want to weep. Since the sixth grade I have bristled every time one of my classmates or colleagues has begun a sentence with the words \"I'm not a feminist, but ...\" Look, you dopes, we should all be feminists. But even me - cocked and ready to respond to anyone who wants to address the questions of gender equity, me - from my privileged, well-educated, media-savvy, urban perch - I am about ready to hurl. </p> <p>\"Are there are any registered vaginas in the house?\" Ensler asked the mostly white crowd at the Apollo. No, actually. But there are registered women. \"I have never been so afraid in my being,\" Ensler said, urging the audience to \"pull out that other paradigm living inside of us waiting to be born.\" What? \"Step into your vaginas and get the vagina vote out.\" Aaaaah! What does stepping into your vagina mean? It sounds like it would hurt! And since Ensler wants us to be frank about our bodies, let me tell the truth: My vagina's role in voting will be pretty minimal compared to the effort my hands and eyes and brain are going to put in. </p> <p>But it's confusing, watching all this. Because there are the real ideological bright spots, the rush of relief at hearing anyone pay attention to women. It would be like throwing out the baby with the bath water to ignore Monday night's very fine performance by Vanessa Carlton, who followed Ensler onstage and announced, \"This is the most vaginal evening I've ever been to. But I'm proud. To have one, I mean,\" before singing her song White Houses, with a verse about losing her virginity that MTV has been censoring. </p> <p>And then there was the B-list stew of stars who showed up onstage and at the press conference before the event. Roseanne Cash and Gina Gershon and Hazelle Goodman - I'm glad they were there. I love seeing someone whose work I admire - like Edie Falco or Patricia Clarkson, neither of whom were at Vaginas Vote, Chicks Rock, but who have been faithful feminist foot soldiers - stand up for issues that register so profoundly for me. But I wonder how much impact they will have. I wonder how many swing-state women will wake up early to vote on November 2 because of Marisa Tomei and Isabella Rossellini's rip-roaring reading of Eve Ensler's V-World monologue at a theatre in Harlem? \"V-world is the centre of us, and it is round,\" they intoned, as V-words like voluptuous, vivid, viva, Venus and vaudeville appeared on the screen. Vaudeville? How about vomit? </p> <p>I'm pretty damn sure the voters won't be pouring out of their Midwestern homes because of Ensler, the media hog who cannot keep her mouth shut. On the press line before the programme, arm in arm with Gloria Steinem and Jane Fonda, Ensler kept interrupting. And no, I don't want her to pipe down 'cause she's a woman. I want her to pipe down because I want to hear other people who have things to say about aspects of feminism not directly related to the clitoris. </p> <p>Watching Fonda and Steinem work the cameras was inspiring. They moved with lithe confidence, Fonda in a V-day T-shirt and boulder-size turquoise jewellery, Steinem in black silks and gold sandals. \"Anyone got questions?\" Fonda bellowed gamely at the rope line, her arms slung around the shoulders of the rest of her kick-line. When a Fox News reporter asked her about the photo of her and John Kerry at an antiwar rally that keeps getting passed around Republican circles, a Vagina Warrior press person quickly stepped in and cut him off. But Fonda happily held forth on the Iraq war with as much candour as she once did the Vietnam conflict.</p> <p> \"It's a lie,\" Fonda said about Iraq. \"I agree with the military experts who say it's a quagmire.\" And about the upcoming election she said, \"I don't think there's ever been such a clear choice between radicalism and moderation. I mean, we are dealing with a radical ideologue here.\" </p> <p>Steinem elaborated on what she thought would inspire younger women to get out and vote: \"Maybe they want to go to college. College tuitions have risen 30% under the Bush administration. Maybe they drink water; the Safe Drinking Water Act, which has been protected by six previous administrations, has been badly damaged under George Bush. Maybe they eat salmon, which is now dangerous because of environmental damage. Nothing is safe now.\" Next to them, Ensler could be heard telling another interrogator, \"Vaginas are catchy!\" </p> <p>It had the same hollow ring as her later introduction of two Afghan women - Malalai Joya and Zoya - and an Iraqi woman named Yanar Mohammed whom Ensler referred to as her \"shero'. I listened to these women plead with the Apollo crowd to vote in November and thought back to the parade of Middle Eastern women who had been trotted in front of delegates and reporters at the Republican convention last month as a testament to George Bush's dedication to women's rights. I'm not sure that they're not all being used for the same thing - emotional baseball bats with which to kick the other side in the nuts. And I'm not sure that the rest of us - from Ensler to me to the audience to a nation's worth of female voters - aren't being used, perhaps even mocked, in similar ways. </p> <p>It's like all this attention to us girls is a way of making fun of us that we don't quite get - like American idol William Hung. We think they are taking us seriously. And yes, they should be. But if we think this is going to last, we're crazy, because after November 2, women as a demographic and voting bloc will stop being important to politicians. We have problems that go well beyond getting into voting booths for this election. If we care about ourselves, we have to find a way to put issues like equal pay and universal day care and labour rights and reproductive safety and freedom on the table in a meaningful way, every day, when there is no election coming up. </p> <p>Maybe that's why women like Fonda and Steinem look so great in comparison to Ensler and the Vagina Warriors - because they have been there. They have fought and been forgotten and abused and mocked and had to think rigorously and argue vociferously and been forced to base their arguments on more than writhing vulvic ecstacy. And as a result, they have given us more. Although Fonda did not appear onstage, Steinem did. At 70 years old, she walked with grace and spoke with a gravity that electrified the crowd. She joked about how as a child in Toledo she dreamed of \"tap-dancing my way out of the Midwest and into the hearts of the American people\" on the amateur stage of the Apollo. She soon realized, she acknowledged, that she was maybe not the Apollo type and that she was not a good tap dancer. But, she said, \"if a crazy white girl from Toledo can make it to the stage of the Apollo, then we can win this fucking election\". </p> <p>Steinem's clipped deployment of the F-bomb was more galvanizing and shocking than the preceding three hours of clitorises and orgasms. She then read a witty top-10 list of reasons she'll be voting in November, including George Bush's failure ever to go to the Apollo, her suspicion that he has never been above 96th Street in Manhattan, and his inability to find time to meet with the black caucus in his four years as president despite three meetings with the pope. \"I don't want to vote for someone I wouldn't hire,\" Steinem continued dryly, noting that the president \"was a cheerleader with a low C average\" who \"couldn't find any oil in Texas\". She noted Bush's federal judge appointments, his privatisation of the prison system, his poor environmental record, and the fact that \"he's never met an NRA demand he doesn't like\". Mostly, she said, she'll be voting because \"the suffrage and abolitionist movements gave their lives for the vote\". </p> <p>In short, Steinem spoke to the crowd as if we were educated adults. And it felt great. So crisp in comparison to the rest of the night, the rest of the media-fuelled frenzy over wooing women. Steinem seemed to know how to strike the only tone that might carry this energy past the election. Because if we reduce everything to the flaccid vagina T-shirts and reductionist, sex-positive one-liners, we are doing our best to ensure a fate I already fear: that as soon as this election is over, we will be forgotten again. </p> <p>In fact, I was so moved by Steinem and her eloquent, hard-edged comments that it made it all the more difficult to return to Ensler's final explosion, in which she read the dictionary on the spelling of VOTE: \"Voracious! Vociferous! Vitamin! Vehement!\" \"Oppose! Out of office! Overcome, overflow, orgasm!\" \"Talented! Tantalizing! Turn out! Texas!\" Mysteriously, she didn't shout any e-words, instead returning to her favourite letter, and yelping in alphabetic ecstacy, \"Vulva! Vulva! Vulva! Vote!\" </p> <p>Oh. My. God. Make it stop. Talk to me about healthcare and the war and labour laws and Mideast politics and the threat of nuclear force in North Korea and job outsourcing and the price of education and how we're going to take all this money being spent on big shows at the Apollo and use it to revive a serious multiracial, multigenerational coalition of people dedicated to exploring gender equality. By all means talk to me about sex - about men and women and love and violence and gender representation and body image and safety and issues of intimacy. But please, please stop telling my vagina to vote. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> This article has been provided by Salon through a special arrangement with Guardian Newspapers Limited.<br> \u00a9 Salon.com 2004 Visit the Salon site at <a href=\"http://www.salon.com\">salon.com</a></p>",
  "Campaigning for England's first regional devolution referendum kicked off yesterday with a robust exchange between opposing factions minutes after the Electoral Commission officially designated \"yes\" and \"no\" groups eligible for public funds. <p>Opponents of a proposed north-east assembly, which will be broadly similar to the Greater London authority, claimed a new body would be both costly and \"powerless\", with only limited functions.</p> <p>Supporters accused the \"no\" camp of whipping up fears and maintained that an assembly offered the prospect of key decisions being taken regionally rather than in London - \"a million miles away metaphorically\", according to their spokesman, Professor John Tomaney. </p> <p>Firing the starting pistol for what promises to be a bruising campaign in north-east England, the Commission chairman, Sam Younger, acknowledged that the November 4 all-postal contest would also be a dry-run for a future referendum on the Euro. </p> <p>In its first major test, the commission has allocated \u00a3100,000 to the broadly-based Yes 4 the North East campaign, which has support from several local personalities as well as Labour and the Liberal Democrats, and North East Says No, backed by several businessmen as well as Tories and the UK Independence party. </p> <p>Spending for each group will be capped at \u00a3665,000, including the \u00a3100,000, while the groups will also qualify for a free mailshot to more than a million households in the north-east as well as television and radio campaign broadcasts and free use of public rooms for meetings. </p> <p>But the commission acknowledges that the referendum campaign could be abused by wealthy individuals, outside the main campaign groups. This is because \"permitted participants\" will also be able to spend up to \u00a3100,000, leading to fears that some will exploit the process by spreading money around sympathisers while remaining anonymous. </p> <p>In addition, spending limits will be placed on political parties, although it is unlikely that they will be willing to dip deeply into campaigning funds seven months before a possible general election. Based on regional voting patterns, Labour will be allowed to spend up to \u00a3665,000 while the Tories, Liberal Democrats, and UKIP will be capped at \u00a3400,000. </p> <p>Although North East Says No is backed by several leading businessmen, such as former north-east transport magnate Sir Tom Cowie, its spokesman, Graham Robb, insisted the group would be hard-pressed to raise much more than the \u00a3100,000 from public funds. \"There are no big cheques around,\" he claimed. </p> <p>The Yes 4 the North East campaign is making much of its high profile supporters, particularly former Olympic athlete Brendan Foster, the mayor of Middlesbrough, Ray Mallon, and the president of Newcastle United Football Club, Sir John Hall. </p> <p>So far, the \"no\" campaign has no well-known personalities. \"I am quite happy for important people to be on their side if the arguments on our side,\" maintained Mr Robb, a former disc jockey and Conservative candidate, who runs a public relations company which has undertaken work for the Tories. </p> <p>Yesterday, at a news conference to announce the designation of official campaigning groups, leaders of both camps sat alongside Mr Younger as they made their first statements. John Tomaney, chairman of Yes 4 the North East and professor of regional governance at Newcastle University, accused opponents of \"scaremongering\". </p> <p>\"We have a winning argument,\" he added. \"They offer only negativity ... no solutions to the issues confronting the north-east. Our message is simple - be proud, be positive, say Yes.\" </p> <p>But Mr Robb said the absence of meaningful powers for a proposed assembly meant the \"yes\" camp was \"advertising a product which doesn't exist\".</p> <p>Asked if he would back an assembly with stronger powers, he replied: \"We're not opposed to the concept...\"</p> <p>If electors vote Yes on November 4, the government says a full-blown election for a 25-member north-east assembly could be held in 2006. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Labour will retain Peter Mandelson's former seat of Hartlepool, according to an NOP poll for Channel 4 News yesterday. It puts Labour on 53% - 33 points ahead of the Liberal Democrats. With byelection successes in Leicester South and Brent East, the Lib Dems have high hopes. However, the poll is also bad news for the Conservatives; they were in third place, just four points ahead of Ukip.</p>",
  "Prominent widows of the September 11 2001 terror attacks endorsed John Kerry's run for the presidency yesterday, accusing George Bush of betrayal and of leading the country into a state of permanent war. <p>\"The truth is, after watching the Republican convention in New York, I am scared. I am scared of the mentality,\" said Kirsten Breitweiser, the most celebrated of the self-styled Jersey Girls, four widows who led a dogged campaign to force the Bush administration to establish an independent investigation into the attacks. </p> <p>Yesterday's endorsement by five women who lost their husbands in the World Trade Centre, and a survivor of the attack on the Pentagon, was designed to reassure a doubting US public that Mr Kerry could be relied on to keep the country safe. </p> <p>Ms Breitweiser's defection - she voted for Mr Bush in the 2000 elections - presents a symbolically important counter-argument to the Republican campaign's appropriation of the war on terror as an election prop. </p> <p>Mr Bush has made national security and bold leadership the centrepiece of his election campaign, and it was centre stage at the Republican convention, where speakers and hi-tech imagery conflated the attacks on the World Trade Centre with the war on Iraq. </p> <p>As the widows described it yesterday, that display of pageantry was the final straw, convincing them to go to Mr Kerry and offer their support. Their reasons were manifold: anger at the war on Iraq, which they view as a diversion from the hunt for al-Qaida, an abiding sense of frustration with an administration they accuse of obstructing the investigation into the intelligence failings that led to the 2001 attacks, and fear of another attack. </p> <p>\"It has been a painful process to accept that President Bush failed us,\" said Patty Casazza, another of the Jersey Girls, and like Ms Breitweiser, a former Republican voter. </p> <p>Democratic strategists say the endorsements could help Mr Kerry's attempts to reduce the 20-point advantage Mr Bush enjoys on terrorism. They also hope that it will stem the erosion of another crucial constituency for Mr Kerry: women voters. </p> <p>A Time magazine poll this week revealed a reversal in the traditional gender gap, with women now favouring Mr Bush over Mr Kerry by 45% to 44%. Pollsters attribute the shift to \"security mums\", women who set aside their reservations about the president's conservative agenda because of their concern for their family's safety. </p> <p>It is hoped that some will be won back by Ms Breitweiser, a homemaker who has amply demonstrated her political savvy and talent for publicity during the last three years. </p> <p>On Capitol Hill, where the widows were dogged in their pursuit of an independent investigation into the tragedy, Ms Breitweiser is famous for bringing her dead husband's wedding ring along when she talked to politicians. Members of Congress have found it difficult to resist the widow's pleas - first for an investigation into the attacks, and now for a sweeping overhaul of the intelligence services. </p> <p>But the potential risks of using the 9-11 attacks in the election campaign are inescapable. </p> <p>Although President Bush has made the war on terror the centrepiece of his campaign, and the vice-president, Dick Cheney, went so far last week as to warn that Americans faced another terrorist attack if they elected Mr Kerry, the widows' endorsement could rebound on the Democratic presidential candidate. </p> <p>As Democrats and Republicans have used the imagery of September 11 - and both parties brought relatives of the dead on stage at their conventions - the attacks have become an increasingly divisive issue in America. </p> <p>Until yesterday, Ms Breitweiser and the other widows claimed to use their moral authority on behalf of all Americans. However, they have become strongly identified as critics of the Bush administration. They have been targeted by conservative commentators who call them \"rock stars of grief\". </p> <p>Earlier this year, they were savaged by conservative commentators for criticising Mr Bush's use of imagery from the rubble of the World Trade Centre during his re-election campaign.</p>",
  "Yesterday's FE Diary (page 17, Education) incorrectly said that the education secretary Charles Clarke had refused to attend the Association of Colleges' annual conference. He is in fact scheduled to deliver its main speech on November 16, in Birmingham. <p>In our table setting out Tony Blair's new government, page 11, September 10, we concluded that it included 113 MPs. In fact the number of Commons ministers (the only ones who are MPs) comes to 90: 75 departmental ministers plus 15 Commons whips. </p> <p>In a column, Mired in the campaign mud again, page 17, September 13, we said that from the polls we could learn, among other things, that \"Kerry is winning in the war on Iraq (50%-36%) but Bush wins on the war against terror (66%-25%)\". The Zogby pollsters themselves say: \"Kerry leads among those who say that their top issues are jobs and the economy (50%-39%), education (48%-37%), the war in Iraq (50%-36%), and healthcare (50%-34%). But, among those who say that the 'war on terrorism' is their top concern, Bush leads by 41 points (66%-25%). Right now all the talk is on the 'war on terrorism.' Kerry has to change the talk.\" </p> <p>In Ringing the changes (page 24, Online, September 2), we claimed that the telecoms regulator, Ofcom, had ruled that consumers should be able to buy \"naked\" broadband connections - broadband connection without paying for a telephone line. Such recommendations are under review, but in fact it was the US regulator, the Federal Trade Commission, that made the order, applicable only to US operators. </p> <p>Toulouse-Lautrec and the Art of the French Poster, an exhibition at the Bowes Museum, Barnard Castle, ends on March 16, not January 9 as mistakenly stated, page 19, Review, September 11. </p> <p>It is the policy of the Guardian to correct significant errors as soon as possible.

  "Jonathan Freedland argues that the prime minister is \"a man who has run out of ideas\" (Tony Blair's survival is an affront to our constitution, September 11). <p>The struggle in the Labour party is not about Tony Blair's lack of ideas. It is down to a refusal by many in the party to accept them. The one big idea for Labour was espousing \"the enterprise of the market and the rigour of competition\", written down as a new core principle in clause four. Yet when policy makers argue in favour of relying on such forces, many of the party faithful cry foul. </p> <p>There are lots more examples of the new vision: fairness but no favours for the unions; accepting the global economy as a reality; politics of the centre and so on. </p> <p>Now Freedland argues that \"every day [Blair] remains [as leader] is an affront to the constitution\". Yet his argument only concerns the opinions of people in the party. Blair was chosen by the electorate, on a set of principles and policies presented in clear terms. To seek to remove the prime minister now would be a far greater affront to our constitution.<br> <b> Mike Allott</b><br> Eastleigh, Hants </p> <p>Such is the glory of the unwritten British constitution that Blair can quite legitimately believe the only way he can be turfed out of Downing Street is by allowing Michael Howard in. Any other exit strategy would be an affront to the man's pride and vanity. </p> <p>Jonathan Freedland, a great admirer of so many things American, must look longingly across the Atlantic at the 22nd amendment of the US constitution, which states: \"No person shall be elected to the office of the president more than twice.\" If that sensible guard against dictatorship was the case here, who would not be celebrating as the clock ticked down on Blair's premiership?<br> <b> Rick Bryant</b><br> Exeter, Devon </p> <p>Jonathan Freedland rightly exposes the constitutional cracks that have enabled our prime minister to evade accountability for the war in Iraq. An impotent opposition in parliament, a subservient judiciary, a useless church, a cowardly media and a cynical Labour party have allowed this country to go to war not just on one lie, but a lot of lies. I am amazed that people are not taking to the streets in outrage at this shabby and shameful misgovernment. </p> <p>But there's one more plank of the constitution that Freedland didn't mention: we, the people. An election is not the answer: we might want to vote Labour, but we don't want to vote for this prime minister. The only way left is to take to the streets and demonstrate and to do it soon. Remember the WI?<br> <b> Gillian Gunner</b><br> Sherborne, Dorset </p> <p>At last a senior journalist is showing his mettle. Freedland's article, like most of his comments, reminds me of the old fearless Guardian of liberal values. Britain is approaching a totalitarian state by consent. In such a state there is no oppression, no political prisoners and no visible dissent. Every citizen and every institution is in a zombified acquiescence, morally ambivalent, intellectually philistine and thoroughly mean.<br> <b> Yousef Abdulla</b><br> Orpington, Kent </p> <p>It is Jonathan Freedland's elitism, not Tony Blair's premiership, that is \"an affront to our constitution\". He dislikes Blair, and so do the \"mandarins\", \"the establishment including the judiciary\", and \"the press\". Freedland's argument is clear. Leave politics to the elite, because you can't trust the people.<br> <b> Hugh Bayley MP</b><br> Lab, City of York</p>"
