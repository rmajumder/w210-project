  "The Kremlin is facing growing public anger at its refusal to recognise Tuesday night's double airline crash as an act of terrorism. <p>Officials continued to suggest yesterday that it would take another two days for the investigation to draw any definitive conclusions. But the country's press was united in insisting that the incident - in which two planes apparently blew up in mid-air simultaneously, killing 90 people - was another terror attack, presumably by Chechen extremists. </p> <p>That theory gained weight yesterday, when it was confirmed that the crew of one of the airliners had triggered the SOS button before their plane crashed. Although Vladimir Yakovlev, President Putin's envoy to the southern region encompassing Chechnya, told the ITAR-Tass news agency that the planes' data recorders hadn't provided any firm clues, he said terrorism remained the most likely cause. </p> <p>The commission set up to investigate, headed by the transport minister Igor Levitin, headed for the crash scenes yesterday, joined by a team of explosives experts from the Russian security services, the FSB, which had earlier pushed the idea that a technical error was to blame. </p> <p>The two planes, flying out of Moscow, crashed on Tuesday at 11pm. A Tupelov-134 bound for Volgograd fell from the sky near Tula, 124 miles from the capital, just as a Tupelov 154 heading to the southern beach resort of Sochi crashed near Rostov on Don. There were no survivors. Witnesses reported seeing explosions before the planes crashed. </p> <p>The Kremlin has not yet officially backed Mr Yakovlev's assertion; analysts believe they do not want to admit that such a gross lapse in domestic security could occur in the run-up to vital elections in Chechnya. </p> <p>On Sunday the republic will vote for a successor to Akhmad Kadyrov, the Chechen president assassinated in May. </p> <p>The Russian media yesterday said the Kremlin, already embarrassed by Mr Kadyrov's death and a recent series of daring attacks by militants, did not want to declare the cause of the crashes until the elections are over. </p> <p>Yesterday, officials appeared to stall, saying the two recovered black boxes would take two days to examine. However Mr Yakovlev said the boxes had already been examined and did not yield any useful information. </p> <p>He told Rossiya state television: \"The tapes ... did not show anything. Practically speaking [the data recorders] switched themselves off immediately.\" </p> <p>Yet there have been signs that Moscow will have to accept that the double crash was not an ugly coincidence. </p> <p>On Wednesday President Putin ordered the drafting of emergency laws that would turn airport security over to the interior ministry. </p> <p>Yesterday - a day of mourning in Russia - a policeman from the ministry was at each security point at Vnukovo, one of Moscow's airports. </p> <p>The Russian media, which often toes the Kremlin's line on Chechnya, yesterday declared the crashes the work of terrorists. Even the state newspaper, Rossiskaya Gazeta, carried an opinion piece on its second page titled \"The terror norm\". </p> <p>The Nezavisimaya Gazeta carried the front-page headline \"Russia now has a September 11\". </p> <p>The newspaper Kommersant said: \"It looks like before the Chechen presidential election the authorities simply do not want to admit an obvious fact: Only Chechen fighters are capable of carrying out terrorist attacks of such scale.\" </p> <p>It also quoted an unnamed FSB officer in Rostov on Don as saying: \"[After the poll] things will clear up. Until then, let the disasters be blamed, say, on technical fault or poor quality fuel. This is dictated by the situation.\"</p>",
  "I've been here a week now, watching the city prepare for the Republican national convention and the accompanying protests. Much is predictable: tabloid hysteria about an anarchist siege; cops showing off their new crowd-control toys; fierce debates about whether the demonstrations will hurt the Republicans or inadvertently help them. <p>What surprises me is what isn't here: Najaf. It's nowhere to be found. Every day, US bombs and tanks move closer to the sacred Imam Ali shrine, reportedly damaging outer walls and sending shrapnel flying into the courtyard; every day children are killed in their homes as US soldiers inflict collective punishment on the holy city; every day, more bodies are disturbed as US marines stomp through the Valley of Peace cemetery, their boots slipping into graves as they use tombstones for cover. </p> <p>Sure, the fighting in Najaf makes the news, but not in any way connected to the election. Instead it's relegated to the status of a faraway intractable ethnic conflict, like Afghanistan, Sudan or Palestine. Even within the antiwar movement, the events in Najaf are barely visible. The \"handover\" has worked: Iraq is becoming somebody else's problem. It's true that war is at the centre of the election campaign - just not the one in Iraq. The talk is all of what happened on Swift boats 35 years ago, not what is being dropped out of US AC-130 gunships this week. </p> <p>But while Vietnam has taken up far too much space in this campaign already, I find myself thinking about the words of Vietnam veteran and novelist Tim O'Brien. In an interview for the 1980 documentary Vietnam: The 10,000 Day War, he said: \"My time in Vietnam is a memory of ignorance and I mean utter ignorance. I didn't know the language. I couldn't communicate with the Vietnamese except in pidgin English. I knew nothing about the culture of Vietnam. I knew nothing about the religions. I knew nothing about the village community. I knew nothing about the aims of the people, whether they were for the war or against the war ... No knowledge of what the enemy was after ... and I compensated for that ignorance in a whole bunch of ways, some evil ways. Blowing things up, burning huts as a frustration of being ignorant and not knowing where the enemy was.\" </p> <p>He could have been talking about Iraq today. When a foreign army invades a country about which it knows virtually nothing, there is plenty of deliberate brutality, but there is also the unintended barbarism of blind ignorance. It starts with cultural and religious slights: soldiers storming into a home without giving women a chance to cover their heads; army boots traipsing through mosques that have never been touched by the soles of shoes; a misunderstood hand signal at a checkpoint with deadly consequences. </p> <p>And now Najaf. It's not just that sacred burial sites are being desecrated with fresh blood; it's that Americans appear unaware of the depths of this offence, and the repercussions it will have for decades to come. The Imam Ali shrine is not a run-of-the-mill holy site; it's the Shia equivalent of the Sistine Chapel. Najaf is not just another Iraqi city, it is the city of the dead, where the cemeteries go on for ever, a place so sacred that every devout Shia dreams of being buried there. And Moqtada al-Sadr and his followers are not just another group of generic terrorists out to kill Americans: their opposition to the occupation represents the overwhelmingly mainstream sentiment in Iraq. Yes, if elected, Sadr would try to turn Iraq into a theocracy like Iran, but for now his demands are for direct elections and an end to foreign occupation. </p> <p>Compare O'Brien's humility with the cockiness of Glen Butler, a major in the marines whose August 23 New York Times article reads as if it were ghostwritten by Karl Rove. Butler brags that though he has been in Iraq for a month, he \"know[s] a bit about the caliph, about the five pillars and about Allah\". He explains that by swooping low over Najaf's cemeteries, he is not inflaming anti-US hatred but \"attacking the source of the threat\". He dismisses his enemies as foreign fighters and ex-Ba'athists and \"a few frustrated Iraqis who worry about Wal-Mart culture infringing on their neighbourhood\". </p> <p>It's hard to know where to begin. The Mahdi army that Butler is attacking is made up of Iraqi citizens, not foreigners. They are not Ba'athists: they were the most oppressed under Saddam's regime and cheered his overthrow. And they aren't worried that Wal-Mart is taking over their neighbourhood: they are enraged that they still lack electricity and sewage treatment, despite the billions pledged for reconstruction. </p> <p>Before Sadr's supporters began their uprising, they made their demands for elections and an end to occupation through sermons, peaceful protests and newspaper articles. US forces responded by shutting down their newspapers, firing on their demonstrations and bombing their neighbourhoods. It was only then that Mr Sadr went to war against the occupation. And every round fired out of Butler's helicopter doesn't make Des Moines and Santa Monica safer, as he claims. It makes the Mahdi army stronger. </p> <p>As I write, the plan for the convention demonstration seems to be to express general outrage about Iraq, to say \"no to war\" and \"no to the Bush agenda\". This is an important message, but it's not enough. We also need to hear specific demands to end the disastrous siege on Najaf, and unequivocal support for Iraqis who are desperate for democracy and an end to occupation. </p> <p>The US antiwar coalition, United for Peace and Justice states that \"there are two key moments this year when people throughout the United States will have the opportunity to send a resounding message of opposition to the Bush agenda: November 2, election day; and August 29, in New York City\". Sadly, this isn't the case: there is no chance for Bush's war agenda to be clearly rejected on election day because John Kerry is promising to continue, and even strengthen, the military occupation of Iraq. That means there is only one chance for Americans to express their wholehearted rejection of the ongoing war on Iraq: in the streets outside the Republican national convention. It's time to bring Najaf to New York. </p> <p> This column was first published in The Nation <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com\">www.thenation.com</a></p>",
  "<b> Adrian Hamilton</b> <br> Independent, August 26 <p>\"Not a drum was heard, not a funeral note, as Washington this week quietly buried the road map to peace ... The US acceptance of additional settlement building [in the West Bank] is so absolute a slap in the face of its road-map partners, so exclusively attuned to [George Bush's] domestic political needs, that its partners have responded with open-mouthed silence.

  "The number of Americans living in poverty grew for the third successive year during 2003, swelling to almost 36 million people. <p>The figures will be unwelcome news for President George Bush, struggling to convince voters ahead of November elections that he has the economy back on track. </p> <p>According to the annual Census Bureau report, another 1.3 million Americans slid into poverty during the year, taking the total to 35.9 million, around 12.5% of the population. That was up from 34.5 million (12.1%) in 2002. </p> <p>Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry seized on the numbers as evidence that the Bush administration's economic policies had failed. </p> <p>During Mr Bush's years in the White House 4.3 million people have fallen into poverty and 5.2 million have lost their health insurance. \"Under George Bush's watch, America's families are falling further behind,\" Mr Kerry said. </p> <p>The growth in poverty was most marked among children. There were 12.9 million living in poverty last year, some 17.6% of the under-18 population. That was an increase of 800,000 from 2002. </p> <p>Around 24.4% of African-Americans are living below the poverty line, the highest incidence among racial groups. </p> <p>The number of people without health insurance grew by about 1.4m people last year. Nearly 45m people are without health coverage, around 15.6% of the population. </p> <p>The Republican senator Judd Gregg, chairman of the Senate health, education, labour and pensions committee, defended the president's record. He said the 2003 study failed to take full account of the president's tax cuts. </p> <p>The percentage of Americans living in poverty is now at its highest level since 1998.</p>",
  "There is a striking moment in Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 when members of the Congressional Black Caucus petition Congress to re-examine the 2000 election results. One by one, African Americans from the lower chamber, the House of Representatives, approached the dais and explained that, in light of the large number of black voters who were turned away from the polls in Florida, the results were invalid. <p>In order to have their grievance tabled and discussed, they needed one senator to support them. The motion fell because not one of the 100 senators, two for each state in the union, was prepared to back them. Not one senator was black. </p> <p>Come November 3, that will change. For the first time in American history, both the main candidates in a senate race are black. In the election to replace the Republican senator Peter Fitzgerald, of Illinois, the Democrats are fielding Barack Obama, 43. His only gaffe during the Democratic party convention in Boston was to deliver a speech that was so well received that it threatened to overshadow John Kerry's. For the Republicans there is Alan Keyes, 54, an ultra-religious former ambassador to Unesco who stood in 2000 for the Republican presidential nomination. </p> <p>Given that only two black senators have ever been elected by popular vote, an all-black Senate race in a state that is 73% white is a significant moment. The fact that it should happen in Illinois, which markets itself as the Land of Lincoln, home of the American president credited with freeing the slaves, is greeted with a mixture of pride and feigned indifference. </p> <p>\"Well, it's about time,\" said DuWayne Thompson, an African American in the downstate town of Joliet. \"I don't know if white people have a problem with it. But they shouldn't. We have to choose between two white men for president every time and they don't complain.\" </p> <p>Many white people insist that they have barely noticed. \"I don't think it's important,\" says Cathy Harvey, filling up on petrol in the nearby town of Morris. \"We've moved on from that now. So long as they can represent the state well, I don't care what colour their skin is.\" </p> <p>Winning Illinois demands a tricky political balancing act at the best of times. Demographically, Cook County, home to Chicago and its sprawling suburbs, dominates the state. More than 40% of Illinois' population, and 75% of its African Americans, live in Cook County. </p> <p>The state is larger than England, but beyond the shadow of Chicago's skyline lies mostly farmland and prairie. Illinois' second biggest city, Rockford, would fit into Chicago 20 times. </p> <p>So a candidate cannot win Illinois without appealing to the cosmopolitan, more liberal and more diverse city; but they must also engage the more rural, white, socially conservative part of the state. </p> <p>When Mr Obama, formerly a state senator from Chicago, kicked off his campaign for the Democratic nomination, only about 50 people attended a launch party. \"At that stage it wasn't clear that he would even get the African-American vote,\" said one supporter who attended but did not wish to be named. </p> <p>On top of that he had a name that rhymed with Osama. Mr Obama used it to connect with crowds, calling himself \"the skinny kid with the funny name\" and telling the young: \"My name is Obama, not Yo Mama.\" </p> <p>Mr Obama was in a tight race to represent the Democrats against a wealthier, white candidate, Blair Hull, who spent $29m (\u00a316m) on his campaign and was backed by one of Chicago's most prominent black politicians, the former black panther Bobby Rush. </p> <p>\"At the beginning, a lot of people in the black community didn't think Obama was black enough,\" says Salim Muwakkil, a contributing editor for the radical magazine In These Times. \"He was bi-racial; he was Ivy League and he wasn't from Chicago. White people liked him so much, they didn't really trust him.\" </p> <p>Mr Hull's campaign imploded after unsealed divorce papers alleged he had struck his ex-wife and threatened to kill her. Mr Obama romped home, avoiding a runoff with 53% of the vote in the first round. </p> <p>By June, Mr Obama held a double-digit lead over the Republican challenger Jack Ryan, when Mr Ryan's campaign also collapsed. Previously sealed divorce papers revealed that he had tried to force his ex-wife to go to sex clubs and allow others to watch them have sex. After pressure from state Republicans, Mr Ryan dropped out, leaving them four months from polling day without a candidate. </p> <p>The Republicans had difficulty finding a contender so late. Then, this month, Mr Keyes said he had \"a moral obligation\" to run against Mr Obama's record on abortion, gun control and tax. </p> <p>\"Obama has never seen a spending bill he couldn't find some excuse for, and has never seen a tax increase he didn't like,\" he said. </p> <p>\"We needed to find another Harvard-educated African American who had some experience on the national political scene,\" the Republican legislator Steven Rauschenberger told the Los Angeles Times. \"We need that because the Democrats have made an icon out of Barack Obama. The only way to fight back is to find your own icon, and that is not going to be an easy thing to do.\" </p> <p>Critics say the Republicans' choice of Mr Keyes was cynical and tokenistic. \"They know they can't win so they are trying to bloody Obama,\" says Mr Muwakkil. </p> <p>Others disagree. \"Some people think the Republicans were trying to be cute by picking another black guy,\" says Tom Roeser, a columnist for the Chicago Sun-Times. \"But the white establishment only ever picks one black guy to lead black America at any one time. The Democratic convention was Obama's coronation and now he's being groomed for the presidency. I think Alan wants to make it clear that Obama doesn't represent African Americans and there are more choices out there.\" </p> <p>Mr Keyes' brand of religious zealotry, maverick tendencies (last week he embraced reparations for slavery), and theatrical flourishes (he has branded Mr Obama's pro-choice stance as \"the slaveowner's position\"), does not play well in midwest heartlands. Nor do his Republican affiliation and anti-affirmative action stances please African Americans. </p> <p>At this stage the race is Mr Obama's to lose. A Chicago Tribune poll on Sunday gave him a 41-point lead, and 96% of the black vote. </p> <p>Even Mr Keyes' supporters concede that he has very little chance, but hope his candidacy may help shake up a moribund state party. </p> <p>\"I don't think Jack Ryan was going to win either,\" says Mr Roeser. </p> <p>\"But I think Alan is going to make Obama the issue. And given all the expectations there are now that he might be the first black president, I think Obama is the issue.\"</p>",

  "History is beginning to repeat itself, this time over Iran. Just two years after the notorious Downing Street dossier on Saddam Hussein's alleged weapons of mass destruction and the first efforts to get United Nations approval for war, Washington is trying to create similar pressures for action against Iran. <p>The ingredients are well-known: sexed-up intelligence material which puts the target country in the worst possible light; moves to get the UN to declare it in \"non- compliance\", thereby claiming justification for going in unilaterally even if the UN gives no support for invasion; and at the back of the whole brouhaha, a clique of American neoconservatives whose real agenda is regime change. </p> <p>The immediate focus for action against Iran is the International Atomic Energy Agency, which has produced five reports on Iran in the last 14 months. Part of the UN, with an international board which acts like a mini security council, the IAEA's reports have raised questions about Iran's professedly civilian nuclear programme and its desire to create its own fuel cycle which could eventually be used to produce bombs.</p> <p>To satisfy its critics, Iran agreed last year to allow so-called intrusive inspections. As a confidence-building measure, it also stopped enriching uranium. In a few days' time the IAEA will issue a new report, and it is its wording which is causing the latest flurry. John Bolton, the Bush administration's point-man, has been rushing round Europe claiming the evidence of sinister Iranian behaviour is clear, even though the IAEA has consistently made no such judgment. It has called for more transparency, but prefers to keep probing and, like Hans Blix and the UN weapons inspectors in Iraq in 2003, insists it needs more time.</p> <p>Iran, meanwhile, says the IAEA should accept that nothing wrong has been found, close the dossier and let Iran receive the civilian nuclear technology - with the safeguards that go with it - which countries like Germany and France have promised. </p> <p>Bolton is not, at this stage, claiming to have intelligence which the IAEA's inspectors don't. After the fiasco of the US's pre-war material on Iraq, he has not started to trumpet US sources. But he is choosing to interpret the available knowledge as harshly as possible. He is also close to the Washington hardliners in the Project for the New American Century, who created the doctrine of pre-emptive strikes against unfriendly states and who favour regime change to deal with Islamist fundamentalism.</p> <p>Norman Podhoretz, the arch-conservative editor of Commentary magazine, one of their house journals, said last week: \"I am not advocating the invasion of Iran at this moment, although I wouldn't be heartbroken if it happened.\" </p> <p>There are differences from the anti-Iraq campaign two years ago. This time the US is taking the lead in going to the UN. Bolton wants the IAEA board to say Iran has violated its commitments under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and take the matter to the security council for a decision on sanctions or other stern action. France and Germany are resisting a move to the UN.</p> <p>Second, even the US (Podhoretz excepted) is not talking about a full-scale US invasion with ground troops. It has too many soldiers tied up in Iraq and Afghanistan to spare many for a third campaign. The talk is of using US special forces or airstrikes to destroy Iran's nuclear facilities, or giving a green light to Israel to do it. Slightly less impatiently, there are hints that the CIA will step up its campaign to overthrow the regime in Tehran by encouraging anti-government TV and radio broadcasts from abroad and infiltrating opposition movements. </p> <p>The biggest difference, though, is in Britain's stance. Unlike with the Bush campaign against Saddam Hussein, Britain is siding this time with France and Germany. It is part of a \"troika\" which promotes constructive engagement rather than confrontation with Iran. Their dialogue ran into a sticky phase this summer with allegations of bad faith on both sides, but the three European states are willing to keep it going. </p> <p>They have powerful arguments. The disaster of the Iraq war and the failure to bring peace, stability or order make them want no repetition in Iraq's more populous and larger neighbour. Even \"limited\" air-strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities would unify the country and harden hostility to the west throughout the Middle East, especially if Washington subcontracted the attacks to the Israeli air force. </p> <p>Most Iraqi resistance to the Americans is based on nationalist resentment, and Iranians are no different. People of all political persuasions in Tehran support their country's right to have nuclear power, and probably even bombs. Threatening them with force is not the most intelligent way to persuade them otherwise. </p> <p>The defeat of Iran's reformist MPs in this spring's unfair elections, as well as the certainty that President Mohammad Khatami will be replaced by a less liberal figure next year, have not ended the chance of dialogue with Tehran. European diplomats detect the emergence of a group of \"pragmatic conservatives\" in the Iranian leadership who could be easier to deal with than the beleaguered liberals of the past seven years. Many are non-clerical veterans of the Iran-Iraq war who are influenced by nationalism and economic imperatives more than the revolutionary Islamic ideology of the Khomeini generation. They want better relations with the west. </p> <p>Britain's difference with Washington on Iran is remarkable. It matters more than the better-publicised splits on the Kyoto environmental protocol or the international criminal court. But does Britain's alignment with France and Germany on Iran mean that Tony Blair has really parted with George Bush on a key geo-political and military issue? Or has he not yet spotted that what he regards as the lily-livered flunkies in the Foreign Office are up to their \"realist\" tricks again? They also opposed the invasion of Iraq until Ol' Laser-Eyes in Downing Street focused on the file. </p> <p>We will know the answer after the US election. Even if Kerry wins, European diplomats expect no major change in Washington's policy to wards Iran. Like Cuba, Iran produces special symptoms of irrationality (because of the unrevenged wound to US pride the mullahs caused when they held diplomats hostage in the embassy a quarter of a century ago). </p> <p>So how will Blair cuddle up to the new president? What easier way than to break with France and Germany and show Kerry that, whether there's a Democrat or a Republican in the White House, Britain's prime minister is still best friends when it comes to being tough with Islamist bullies and taking the brave and moral route to war? Inshallah, no. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:j.steele@theguardian.com\">j.steele@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Last year some election watchers made a bold prediction that this presidential election would set a record: the first half billion dollar campaign in hard money alone. It turns out the projections were way too modest. <p>Here are the numbers so far. As of last month, according to the latest campaign finance data, George Bush has raised $243m, and spent $209m. John Kerry has raised $304m and spent $182m. </p> <p>According to federal election rules, the Kerry campaign can only spend another $75m between the day of his nomination and election day, capping his total at around 250 million. The $75m limit only applies to Bush once he accepts the nomination on September 2, allowing him to max out at around $325m. So the combined total of hard campaign dollars alone will crash through the half billion dollar mark. </p> <p>But that's before we even get to soft money contributions, where no caps apply. This year independent soft money organisations from both parties have so far spent $212m. The so-called 527s can keep raising and spending without limit through November 2, putting the country on track for its first billion dollar election - roughly double the money spent in 2000- itself a record year.</p> <p>The exponential rise of campaign dollars is ironically due to a piece of legislation that was supposed to shrink the obscene amount of money thrown at elections. The McCain-Feingold bill of 2002 had lofty intentions, some of which were realised.</p> <p>No longer can huge corporations write six or seven figure cheques directly to candidates in the expectation of a quid pro quo. The strict limits on individual contributions flowing to them has democratised that part of the campaign system. Witness the Howard Dean phenomenon where hundreds of thousands of people each gave two thousand dollars or less to create a popular bandwagon.</p> <p>However the very wealthy have exploited the yawning loophole in the law which allows unlimited money to flow to organisations independent of the campaigns, but working parallel to them. </p> <p>As these groups are forbidden by law to advocate for a particular candidate, they tend toward negative advertising. So not only has the McCain-Feingold bill failed to stop the flow of money to elections, it has resulted in much nastier campaigning. And when a campaign gets nasty that just encourages more spending. </p> <p>We entered the vortex of this spending spree about two weeks ago when an \"independent\" group began airing the infamous Swift Boat ad calling John Kerry's heroism in Vietnam a sham. Despite Kerry's initial reluctance to break into his campaign coffers in response, hard reality has prevailed, turning the traditionally quiet month of August from the lull before the storm to the storm before the storm. </p> <p>The fallout from the Swift Boat ad has been intructive for voters, because it exploded the fallacy that soft money organisations operate independently of hard money campaigns. This week Democrats pointed out that George Bush's senior campaign lawyer, Benjamin Ginsburg, had been advising \"Swift Boat Veterans for truth\", the group that financed the ad, forcing him to resign. </p> <p>But before Democrats get too righteous on this issue they should remember that a similar nexus of coordination exists on their side too. Jim Jordan - who until November last year was John Kerry's election campaign manager - is now strategising for the biggest independent slush fund of all on the Democratic side- the Media Fund.</p> <p>In fact Democrats caught onto the idea of the shadow election campaign much earlier than Republicans. The first nine of the top ten contributors to 527s this year are Democrats. Republicans are catching up fast, however. Carl Rove has sent the word out to big name visitors to New York next week that they will be expected to open their chequebooks in an effort to match if not dwarf the Democrats' war chest.</p> <p>All of which means that the electorate will be treated to an avalanche of campaign ads- most of them negative- between now and November. Will the important issues of the day be obscured by personal character attacks? Yes. But let's not pretend that any change in the finance laws would radically influence the level of political discourse for the better. </p> <p>The first amendment thankfully protects the rights of everyone to say pretty much what they like about anyone else. Voters are also free to draw their own conclusions, and if they think that a negative attack is unjustified they will punish the practitioner. </p> <p>In a free market, money is the most fungible commodity. The role of big money in the pursuit of the world's biggest political prize cannot be curtailed. But it hasn't diminished the role of the voter. They will get to decide which candidate's half a billion dollars was a worthwhile investment and whose was a colossal waste.</p> <p>\u0095 Philip James is a former senior Democratic party strategist</p>",

  "<p>In a dramatic reversal of its previous position, the White House this week conceded that emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases were the only likely explanation for global warming. </p> <p>Citing the \"best possible scientific information,\" an administration official, James Mahoney, delivered a report to Congress that essentially reversed the previous White House position set out by George Bush, who had refused to link carbon dioxide emissions to climate change. </p> <p>Two years ago, when his administration last published a document claiming that global warming over the last few decades had been prompted by human behaviour, Mr Bush dismissed it as something \"put out by the bureaucracy\". </p> <p>One of Mr Bush's first acts on the international scene as president was to refuse to ratify the Kyoto treaty, which aimed to cut emissions by 5.2% from 1990 levels by 2012 - prompting outrage throughout the world. </p> <p>\"We must argue with the Americans and get them to agree we have to have a global solution, and America is a very important part of that solution,\" the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, said at the time. </p> <p>But Mr Bush also alienated himself from members of his own cabinet as he overrode the recommendations of his newly-appointed head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Christine Todd Whitman. This was widely seen as a payback to the energy lobby which had donated a huge amount to his campaign. </p> <p>At the time Mr Bush cast doubts on the science, claimed restrictions would hamper economic growth, and said the treaty was \"unfair to the United States and to other industrialised nations\" because it exempted developing countries. </p> <p>However, it will be far more difficult for him to distance himself from the current report, because it has been signed by the secretaries of energy and commerce in his administration. </p> <p>Coming just days before the Republican convention opens in New York, it is thought to be another attempt by the administration to show moderate leanings. </p> <p>The report, which also quotes studies that indicate that carbon dioxide stimulates the growth of invasive weeds more than it does crops, is part of a regular series submitted to Congress to monitor global trends. </p> <p>Mr Bush's former allies in the energy industry criticised the findings. Myron Ebell, of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, told the New York Times it was \"another indication that the administration continues to be incoherent in its global warming policies\". </p> <p>Environmentalists say the report's conclusions simply highlight the distance between what the Bush administration has done and what good science suggests should be done. </p> <p>\"For four years the Bush administration has brought the international global warming negotiations to a virtual standstill by claiming that uncertainties in climate science do not justify the cost of tackling it,\" said Rob Gueterbock of Greenpeace. \"Now they have finally accepted that CO2 is causing global warming, they have absolutely no excuse for not rejoining the Kyoto process. Every day they continue to stall will now be held to be criminally negligent by future generations.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>A New York judge has rejected a request from New York's largest anti-war group to hold a rally in Central Park the day before the Republican convention. </p> <p>State supreme court justice Jacqueline Silbermann ruled that United for Peace and Justice was \"guilty of inexcusable and inequitable delay\" in bringing the case to court. </p> <p>The group said it still planned to march past Madison Square Garden, the convention site. </p> <p>The city's parks department had argued that a protest in the park would ruin the lawn.</p>",
  "Pocono Summit, PA. It was here, in the parking lot of Cramer's building supply, only 15 miles from a Nascar racetrack, in a pivotal battleground state, on the back of a battered work van, that we saw the first one. \"Somewhere in Texas,\" the bumper sticker said, \"a village is missing its idiot.\" The next Bush-is-thick sticker showed up at Home Depot on the back of an equally battered pick-up driven by a tough-looking kid dressed for construction work. It said: <p>BUSH </p> <p>LIKE A ROCK </p> <p>ONLY DUMBER </p> <p>These are signs of the fierce conviction of some voters - and the secret fear of a quieter and perhaps larger group - that George Bush is not smart enough to continue as president. Indeed, if an unscientific survey of bumper stickers, graffiti and letters to the editor in this conservative mountain region of eastern Pennsylvania is an indicator, doubts are spreading, and probably not in a way helpful to the Republicans. </p> <p>Yet the subject is seldom taken head on by the mainstream newspapers and network news. The discourse about presidential intelligence appears mainly on the internet, in the partisan press, among television comics and at the level of backyard jokes and arguments. The White House has shown a devious brilliance in keeping a contrived debate on John Kerry's \"fitness\" to be commander-in-chief in the headlines, at the expense of any prolonged journalistic examination of the far more important question of Bush's mental capacity. That uncomfortable question will surely be glossed over when the Republican national convention starts next week in New York. </p> <p>After four decades of newspapering, including coverage of the \"dumb\" Ronald Reagan and the \"smart\" Jimmy Carter in 1976 and 1980, I am not unsympathetic to the problems of reporters and editors trying to inform the public on this touchiest of competency issues. As Richard Reeves commented memorably in a 1976 article comparing Gerald Ford to Bozo the Clown, the rules of conventional journalism make it almost impossible to report that a presidential candidate \"had nothing to say and said it badly to a stunned crowd\". Big news organisations are captives of our own rules of fairness. Voters are doubly disadvantaged - by a paucity of information in the campaign coverage and by the elusive nature of the evidence about the kinds of intelligence that matter in our leaders. </p> <p>For example, my generation of White House correspondents was accused of covering up Ronald Reagan's supposed stupidity and his reliance on fictional \"facts\" derived from Errol Flynn movies and the John Birch Society, the rightwing organisation founded in 1958 to combat the perceived infiltration of communism. In 1981, Clark Clifford, the Democratic \"wise man\", entertained Georgetown dinner parties with the killer line that Reagan was \"an amiable dunce\". Twenty years later, we know that Clifford got indicted for bank fraud and the dunce ended the cold war and the entire Soviet era. </p> <p>This lesson of history raises questions of seeming importance. What is presidential intelligence, and how much does it really matter? Most astute Americans can recite the lists of ostentatiously brilliant presidents who faltered (Wilson, Hoover, etc) and apparent plodders who triumphed (Truman). When I was covering the Reagan White House in 1981, all his top aides were wholesaling Oliver Wendell Holmes' famous comment about FDR possessing \"a second-rate intellect and a first-rate temperament\". In the end, Reagan confounded scholars, journalists and voters alike. Even so devoted a cheerleader as Peggy Noonan, a Reagan speechwriter, sees him as flawed by \"detachment\". His diligent and tormented biographer, Edmund Morris, does not even list \"intelligence\" as an index entry under Reagan, Ronald Wilson. Such entries are also missing from such solid journalistic biographies as those by Lou Cannon and Lawrence Barrett. Morris, in his obituary essay about Reagan in the New Yorker, referred in one paragraph to his instinctive \"intelligence\" and in the next to his \"ignorance\". </p> <p>To be fair, innate intelligence has to do with capability and ignorance to do with variables such as educational opportunity and personal diligence. But the conundrum remains. Is intellect important in presidents? If Americans can't solve the question definitively in the matter of John Kerry and George Bush, we damn sure ought to make an educated guess. </p> <p>One highly imperfect but salient way to do so is at the level of campaign tactics. Does anyone in America doubt that Kerry has a higher IQ than Bush? I'm sure their SATs and college transcripts would put Kerry far ahead. Yet at this point in the campaign, Bush deserves an A or a high B instead of a gentleman's C when it comes to neutralising Kerry's knowledge advantage. That much was apparent even before the campaign got mired in the current argument over the nasty television commercials questioning Kerry's record of heroism as a Swift Boat commander in Vietnam. </p> <p>Over the course of the summer Bush, or more likely his political adviser, Karl Rove, dictated the subject-matter of the campaign by successfully triggering Kerry's taste for complicated ideas and explanations. Kerry is telling voters that we live in a complex world. Americans know that, but as an electorate, they are not drawn to complexity. Kerry's explanations about his conflicting votes on the Iraq war and how he would have conducted it are wondrous as rhetorical architecture. They are also signs that Bush has trapped him into having the wrong conversation with the voters. Last week, Bush trumped Kerry's intricate explanation of his conflicting votes on funding the Iraq war by going on Larry King Live and saying over and over that a president must be resolute, and that he will be. Meanwhile, his wife Laura seemed to make a sale with the outrageous claim that her husband's restrictions on stem cells are not really hurting medical research. </p> <p>Whatever his IQ, George Bush as a candidate is a one-trick pony. The story of the campaign so far is that Kerry is letting him get by with his single trick - endless repetitions of \"I make a decision; I stick to it; that's what presidents do.\" As astute an observer as David Broder has written that Bush's twin millstones - the war and a job-losing economy - may bring about his defeat. I'm not so sure, mainly because Kerry and his running mate, John Edwards, keep talking about what the White House wants them to talk about instead of messages that the bumper-sticker guys at Cramer's and Home Depot need to repeat to their buddies. They have yet to force Bush outside his one-trick comfort zone. </p> <p>That pattern continued this week as Rove demonstrated his mastery of the \"Willie Horton strategy\" perfected by his mentor, the late Lee Atwater. In 1988, Atwater famously destroyed the campaign of Massachusetts governor Michael Dukakis, the Democratic nominee, with a series of \"independent\" ads claiming that Dukakis had improperly paroled a convicted rapist and murderer named Willie Horton. This year, wealthy Bush supporters close to Rove have funded a front organisation called Swift Boat Veterans for Truth to carry out an \"independent\" attack on Kerry's well-documented record as a decorated battle commander in Vietnam. </p> <p>Kerry's demand that Bush condemn the commercial and Bush's hair-splitting refusal to do so dominated the news all week. Bush refers to Kerry's Vietnam service as \"noble\" while carefully avoiding a specific, direct denunciation of the veterans' grossly misleading ad. There's a good reason for this. The president does not want to identify with these worms who sponsored the ads, but he wants their commercials to keep eating away at the apple of Kerry's much stronger reputation as a warrior. </p> <p>Happily for the White House, this contrived debate over Kerry's war record diverts voters from a truly important national-security question related to the intellectual capability of the incumbent. Was George W dumb enough to be talked into adopting a flawed strategy for a phoney war by Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney? The facts and authorship of these blunders are beyond dispute. Cheney and neo-conservative theorists wanted to make war on Iraq, not al-Qaida. Rumsfeld wanted to do it with a much smaller force than the military needed. What we don't know is why Bush went along. </p> <p>Bush's former press secretary, Karen Hughes, in her awkwardly named book Ten Minutes from Normal, assures us that what \"Bush does best of all\" is \"ask questions that bore to the heart of the matter\". She says that during the 2000 campaign, she and a \"brilliant\" issues staff \"never once succeeded\" in anticipating all of Bush's penetrating questions. \"He has a laserlike ability,\" Hughes writes, \"to reduce an issue to its core.\" </p> <p>In regard to Iraq and the war on terror, there's little evidence of such Bush interventions in the public record or the report of the 9/11 Commission. We have been told instead that the then director of central intelligence, George Tenet, misled Bush by assuring him that Saddam Hussein's possession of weapons of mass destruction was \"a slam dunk\". </p> <p>The millions of us who did not witness this and other potentially laserlike interactions must rely on speculation as to how Bush's mind works. The most informative writing I've seen on that score was an essay published over a year ago in the Atlantic Monthly by Richard Brookhiser, the historian and conservative columnist sympathetic to Bush. \"Bush has intelligence, energy and humility,\" he writes, \"but does he have imagination?\" </p> <p>Brookhiser goes on to worry that Bush's limited information \"habitat\" could cut him off from the ideas necessary to feed presidential creativity in activities like running a major war. (\"Habitat\" is a wonderfully chosen word in that it invokes the territoriality of White House advisers in general. Can we imagine Rumsfeld, the alpha-male advocate of hi-tech warfare, inviting the commander of an armoured division into the cabinet room to tell the president why it's stupid not to take more tanks to Iraq?) </p> <p>Brookhiser goes on to speak of Bush's reliance on \"instinct\" and the fact that Bush's religious \"faith means that he does not tolerate, or even recognise, ambiguity\". The comments sent my memory reeling back to the Reagan campaigns and what the cartoonist Garry Trudeau called \"the search for Reagan's brain\". Trudeau's meaning, of course, was that Reagan didn't have one, but these days the phrase is to me more evocative of the journalistic gropings of the White House press corps to explain what, if anything, was going on inside that big, smiling, glossy-haired head. In a filing cabinet I had not opened in over 20 years, I found my own attempt - a 6,000-word draft of \"reflections\" on \"Reagan's mind\". I had never turned the piece in to my editors at the New York Times because I felt I had not solved the mystery as to the quality of Reagan's intellect. </p> <p>I was not the first, nor will I be the last writer to break his pick on that stone. But in reviewing what I wrote in 1982 after two years of close observation of Reagan on the campaign trail and in the White House, I saw a couple of points that seemed worth revisiting as Reagan's self-appointed heir seeks a second term. I characterised Reagan as a \"political primitive\" who valued \"beliefs over knowledge\" based on verifiable facts. The White House spin was that this was a positive in that it represented \"rawbone American thinking\". I also noted that Reagan had a \"high tolerance for ambiguity\" as to the outcome of policies that proceeded from such rough-hewn thought. </p> <p>That strikes me as a different - less troubling - trait than what Brookhiser sees as Bush's refusal to recognise the mere existence of ambiguity. In general, I've come to feel that what we have in George Bush is a shadowy version of Reagan's strengths and an exaggerated version of his intellectual weaknesses. </p> <p>In 1982, at the height of my journalistic desire to explain Reagan's brain, I went to see David Gergen, then a presidential assistant in charge of communications. His was not an easy job, since it included such tasks as explaining Reagan's decision to throw thousands of the most disabled Americans off social security assistance. We're not talking \"welfare queens\" here. We're talking blind people in wheelchairs. </p> <p>I told Gergen I wanted to write a piece for the sophisticated reader about exactly how Reagan's mind worked. With a twinkle in his eye, Gergen said, \"It will be a long, long time before we can have that conversation.\" </p> <p>It hardly seems worth the trouble now. Reagan is in the pantheon, and the American nation and its allies and adversaries escaped mutual assured destruction. Now the US is at war in Iraq in a conflict that could yet metastasise into regional strife or global terrorism. We'll never know how much Reagan thought and how much he gambled in regard to security and economics. My guess is the answer would be pretty scary. So for the 150,000 US troops in Iraq, for the 99% of taxpayers who will not get a five-figure windfall, for the millions of urbanites unsettled by talk of suitcase nukes, it's still worth asking how Bush's mind really works.</p>",

  "<p>Watching last month's Democratic Convention, I was persuaded that whichever genius organised the Boston shindig was a shoo-in for the job of overseeing the next Oscars, so slick, empty and crowd-pleasing were the proceedings. They wouldn't have to change a thing - just shorten the speeches. The party's collective g-spot was relentlessly abraded, all its greatest hits were played: nimble-fingered rock star Bill Clinton doing his Silver Fox thang; Al Sharpton gettin' righteous'n'churchy; Hillary upliftin' the sistaz; plus John Edwards, the housewives' favourite, doing his naff Burt Reynolds impression. </p> <p>So the party faithful headed home for the hustings wearing smiles almost as wide as those on the painted faces of Boston's newly enriched hookers, last seen sashaying en masse, totter-heeled, fat pocketbooks overflowing, towards the city's Cadillac and Lexus dealerships.

Convening, as it were, behind enemy lines in New York City, for the second coronation of President George Amberson Minafer - beg pardon, George Bush - though the filmic echoes are no less apparent. I am expecting Triumph of the Dubya, sort of Leni Riefenstahl, but inside-out and upside-down. </p> <p>Fraulein L's art director Albert Speer played down the ugliness of the Nazi party membership - those fat Austro-Bavarian types who had sucked too much sausage and stared too deeply into their steins - by turning the lights off. </p> <p>One expects the Republican special effects team to use endless smoke and mirrors to conceal the snarling fangs of their beast. Expect to see on stage, amid all the rah-rah bullshit, those ethnic minorities who, as recently as 1992 or 1996, would more likely have been glimpsed working as parking valets, toting the hors d'oeuvres and speaking only when spoken to than behind the podium. Alongside them will be elements of the dejected \"main street\" liberal Republican remnant who are scorned within their own party as RINOs (Republicans in Name Only), and who may one day simply up and split and become the future right wing of the Democratic party. </p> <p>This year's presidential election recalls LBJ's rout of Arizona rightist Senator Barry Goldwater in 1964, but played out against a backdrop more reminiscent of 1968. Each campaign had its filmic analogue: in 1964 it was Gore Vidal and Franklin Schaffner's The Best Man; in 1968 Haskell Wexler's Medium Cool. </p> <p>This year The Best Man feels more prescient and disturbing than ever before. It is set at the convention of an unnamed party yet to select its candidate. The liberal, played by Henry Fonda, is the cerebral Senator Bill Russell, with his \"nuanced\" views and Clintonian womanising, based on 1952 and 1956 Democratic contender Adlai Stevenson. </p> <p>His junkyard dog of an opponent is Senator Joe Cantwell, played by Cliff Robertson, an evocative piece of casting since he had recently played the young JFK in the hagiographical PT-109, a piece of quasi-Swift boat nonsense much more susceptible to demolition than Kerry's exploits in the Mekong Delta. Cantwell does cant very well indeed: he's a handsome, shabby hustler with Attwater-Rovian gutter instincts. He made his political bones blasting a chimerical communist mafia and thinks he can increase military spending while eliminating the income tax. \"He'll do anything to win,\" says Russell, \"and that makes him dangerous.\" Does any of this sound terrifyingly familiar? </p> <p>Cantwell's Shrub-like first instinct on learning that Russell may win the backing of the party's last president, the folksy, gimlet-eyed Art Hochsteader (1930s romantic lead Lee Tracy in a barnstorming swansong performance), is to prepare copies of Russell's psychiatric report for every convention delegate. Initially reluctant to dive into the mire, Russell finally permits his campaign manager to hunt down rumours of Cantwell's involvement in a homosexual scandal. </p> <p>What's missing in today's political landscape is a figure like Hochsteader, with his roots deep in the rural populist tradition, his feel for ordinary America, and his realism about the essential unreality of politicking. \"It's not that I mind your being a bastard, it's your being such a stupid bastard I object to,\" he admonishes Cantwell, before warning him of the fate of those politicians who start believing their own self-generated horseshit. </p> <p>So much for inside the convention hall: Medium Cool climaxes in the streets outside the strife-torn 1968 Democratic convention, and may offer a foretaste of the protests in Manhattan next week. Director Haskell Wexler had been The Best Man's cinematographer in 1964, and for Medium Cool's finale he took his cameras to Chicago's Grant Park, where the Yippies and elements of SDS were preparing to protest the Machine-brokered Humphrey ticket. </p> <p>The \"you-are-there\" feeling is stirring and immediate even today. When the Chicago cops staged what was later called their \"police riot\" against the hippies, Wexler was in the thick of it, indeed one of his assistants can be heard yelling, as a teargas grenade lands nearby, \"Look out, Haskell, it's real!\" </p> <p>And today, nothing in politics is \"real\" - except the consequences we all must suffer. Everything is staged, nothing has any more than surface meaning or value. Imagine a convention today selecting its candidate at 3am instead of in prime-time (McGovern, 1972, the year that also brought us the cynical Candidate, starring Robert Redford, left); or a host-city's mayor being called a fascist, then allowing the nation's lip-readers to catch him calling his tormentor \"you fucking kike\" (Abe Ribicoff v Richard Daley, 1968); or a wheelchair-bound Vietnam veteran being roughly hauled from the floor of a Republican convention amid cacophonous jeering (Ron Kovic, 1972). Not a chance. All we will get next week, as we got last month, is script, make-up, special effects. Lights, cameras, and no action. </p> <p>But outside? Endless possibilities ... Bring on the love riot.</p>"
