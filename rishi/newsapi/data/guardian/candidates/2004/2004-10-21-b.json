  "Wildcat strikes, defiantly angry unions, and a mood of national gloom. A casual reader of the German press last week might have been forgiven for thinking that Germany in 2004 bears an uncanny resemblance to, well, Britain in the 1970s. <p>The decision by General Motors to axe 12,000 jobs across Europe, with the brunt of the cuts falling on Germany, plunged the papers into depression. What, they wondered, had happened to Germany's famous economic miracle? \"Fear blows through the land,\" the liberal weekly <b>Die Zeit</b> noted, as car workers at the firm's Opel plant in the Ruhr town of Bochum staged an impromptu walkout. \"We are afraid of losing our jobs. We are afraid of our competitors. And we are afraid of growing old. What are we supposed to live from when there's scarcely enough money to go round now?\" </p> <p>Other papers had scant sympathy with the striking car workers, who went back to work on Thursday. \"In Bochum a militant minority forced the majority of the workforce to do what they wanted,\" <b>Der Tagesspiegel</b> said. You didn't have to be a \"paranoid anti-capitalist\" to realise the embattled factory's future was now a lot \"vaguer\", it added, as a result of the \"uprising\". </p> <p>Elsewhere, there was bad news for Angela Merkel, the leader of Germany's opposition conservative party, the CDU, who has been fancifully compared to Margaret Thatcher. Mrs Merkel had until recently appeared the likely successor to Germany's chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, - but now faces a plot from her own knife-wielding party colleagues. \"The lonely struggle of Angela Merkel,\" is how <b>Der Spiegel</b> put it. </p> <p>The news magazine said the party's middle-aged male West German leaders or F\u00fcrsten - literally princes - were trying to remove Mrs Merkel, who grew up in East Germany. The CDU's ratings have recently slumped from 50% to 38%, raising the tantalising possibility that Mr Schr\u00f6der might win an unprecedented third time in office when Germany next goes to the polls in 2006. </p> <p>Germany's bestselling tabloid, <b>Bild</b>, carried an interview with Gesine Schwan, the defeated candidate from Germany's presidential election earlier this year. She urged Mrs Merkel to take a leaf out of Lady Thatcher's book. \"Women in politics have to be harder [than men],\" she pointed out. </p> <p>The week's German papers were also eagerly anticipating the visit of another powerful woman - our very own Queen. Under the headline \"The whole of Berlin is waiting for your smile, Majesty!\" the normally sober <b>Die Welt</b> speculated on what kind of hat the British monarch might wear during her three-day state visit to Germany early next month. Would it perhaps be blue? The Queen has already been to Germany three times - a sign, according to British diplomats, of the close relationship between the countries. </p> <p>During her trip to Berlin the Queen will stay in the luxurious Adlon Hotel, Die Welt revealed, next to Germany's most famous monument, the Brandenburg Gate. Her itinerary includes a trip to Berlin's Museum Island, and a \"cup of tea\" in her hotel with Wolfgang Thierse, the bearded president of the German parliament. \"The Queen really eats everything and enjoys typical national dishes,\" one British diplomat assured the paper, after it expressed concern that the monarch might not like German food. </p> <p>One can only hope that the plumbing in the Adlon Hotel has got better since the time of Martin Luther, the celebrated German theologian and the man who launched the Reformation. According to Bild, archaeologists have made a \"sensational discovery\" at the theologian's home in the east German town of Wittenberg. They have found - wait for it - Luther's lavatory. \"The experts are certain,\" Bild reported breathlessly, \"that on this toilet Luther composed his 95 theses, which he nailed to the door of Wittenberg's castle church on October 31 1517.\" </p> <p>The medieval stone loo is about 30cm wide, and has its own cesspit and drain, the tabloid revealed, pointing out that Luther was known to suffer from bad constipation. Dr Stefan Rhein, the director of the nearby Luther museum, hailed the discovery of the toilet, apparently without irony. He told the paper: \"Luther himself admitted that he made many of the discoveries which led to the Reformation in cloaca (in the sewer). But we never knew where the sewer was.\" He went on: \"Now we know what the great reformer meant.\"</p>",
  "Four years on, the US presidential election is again a dead heat betweense a radical conservative and a mainstream liberal. And once more, Ralph Nader's oddball candidacy threatens to tip the delicate balance to the right. <p>This time the consumer activist is a much reduced force. The overwhelming majority of his closest aides and supporters have defected, including Michael Moore. The film-maker went down on his knees on cable television to beg Mr Nader to withdraw. Even his former running mate, Winona LaDuke, has come out for John Kerry. </p> <p>Four years ago, Mr Nader was the Green party candidate, backed by its modest but enthusiastic machine. </p> <p>This time, he is on his own. All he has is patchy backing, in some states, of the Reform party, a conservative, libertarian group a long, long way from his progressive roots. </p> <p>Mr Nader took 2.7% in 2000. In recent weeks, his rating has been closer to 1%. But that support is up to 4%, in some of the swing states. In any case, 1% can easily be the difference between victory and defeat for President George Bush and Senator Kerry. </p> <p>In 2000 Mr Nader took almost 100,000 votes in Florida. Al Gore lost (after supreme court intervention) by 537 votes. That is why the Democratic party, abetted by many former \"Nader's Raiders\", shock troops of the civic activism Mr Nader pioneered, have spent six months desperately trying to keep him off the ballot papers. </p> <p>Like all civil wars, it has been nasty. \"It's beyond bitter,\" said Toby Moffett, formerly one of Mr Nader's oldest friends and now leader of the legal campaign to stop him. \"He likes to say whoever used to be in his movement and is now against him is corrupt and a sellout. We think he has totally lost his bearings.\" </p> <p>The Nader campaign has been helped by rightwingers well aware of its potential to split the progressive vote. Naderites have also resorted to dubious means to obtain signatures on state petitions to get his name on the ballot. Homeless people were paid for every signature they collected; thousands were found to have been forged in the battleground states of Ohio and Pennsylvania, scrawled alongside names and addresses copied out of a phone directory. </p> <p>Anti-Nader forces, meanwhile, have fought a legal war of attrition, bringing one case after another with the intention of driving him out of the race. </p> <p>They have not succeeded. The 70-year-old is an independent in every sense. Political isolation only deepens his martyr's sense of righteousness. \"I always thought that running for elective office is the consummate expression of the right to free speech, assembly, and petition under our first amendment. It shouldn't be that difficult in a democracy to get on the ballot,\" he told University of Minnesota students. </p> <p>He has fought his way on to the ballot in nearly 40 states. But legal objections to the dodgy signatures in Ohio and Pennsylvania have kept him out of two of the tightest and biggest battlegrounds, and the legal struggle has drained his resources. The anti-Nader campaign, combined with Senator Kerry's powerful performance in the debates and outspoken opposition to the Iraq war, have helped erode Mr Nader's backing in the polls from 5% in the spring to the current 1% rump. </p> <p>Anna Greenberg, a pollster with Democratic party ties, said the Nader vote was now very different from four years ago. Its profile now more closely resembles the voters who backed Ross Perot, a maverick conservative Texan who ran in 1992 and 1996. </p> <p>\"In 2000 you had younger collegeeducated males who were progressive and interested in environmentalist issues,\" she said. \"This time it's more like the Perot vote in the 90s: economically populist, anti-corporate, blue collar. They are much more conservative than Nader 2000.\" </p> <p>According to recent Gallup figures, when Nader supporters were asked who they would vote for if he were not on the ballot, 52 % opted for Mr Bush. Ms Greenberg disagrees. Her polling tells her Mr Nader still hurts Mr Kerry more than Mr Bush, although by a much smaller degree than a few months ago. </p> <p>In swing states where Mr Nader has slightly more backing, Iowa, Wisconsin, New Hampshire, New Mexico and Florida, most pollsters believe he still poses a greater threat to the Democrat. The Democrats certainly think so. More than 75 former Nader's Raiders published an open letter: \"As the recipient of financial and political support from rightwing campaign donors, Ralph is party to a disingenuous effort to split the progressive vote in key states. With the major party candidates in a dead heat, Nader is poised to tip the election to Bush - again.\" </p> <p>The ex-raiders will be using phones and chatrooms to convince likeminded Americans to switch their votes. </p> <p>Yet Mr Nader soldiers on, yesterday kicking off a tour of a dozen states with a trip to Florida. His sheer determination is a testament to his single-mindedness. He has never married, and has few interests other than political reform. </p> <p>It was bred in the bone. His father, Nathra, a Lebanese immigrant, ran a restaurant in Winsted, Connecticut, where his forthright political views were served up along with the food. </p> <p>Around the dinner table, the young Ralph was called on to explain and defend his beliefs. \"I spent countless nights around that table eating wonderful Arabic food, and talking to his father and mother,\" Mr Moffett, a fellow Lebanese-American recalls. \"They were very principled people, very idealistic people, but they were also out there. They were not interested in marginal victories, only the absolute will do.\" </p> <p>The young Ralph hated working in a small Connecticut law firm. Restless, he spent his summers hitchhiking across the country talking to truckers and travelling salesmen. What struck him was how dangerous their work was. Their vehicles were death-traps. Getting a job as a congressional aide in the early 1960s, he researched the car industry and in 1965, produced Unsafe at Any Speed, an indictment of modern cars, particularly the Chevrolet Corsair. </p> <p>For years it was Ralph Nader against General Motors, who went so far as to hire private detectives to discredit him. They sent a prostitute to try to seduce him at a food counter at Safeway's but he turned her away. So the gumshoes tried to prove he was homosexual but were caught as they tried to follow him into Congress. The scandal made Mr Nader into a hero overnight. The car makers were forced to introduce seat belts, and ultimately air bags. </p> <p>In the 1970s, Mr Nader toured the country again, this time urging students to set up public interest research groups for consumer and environmental reform. Ken Ward was a Massachusetts student in 1976. \"He was talking to people afterwards, and there was a professor talking about this method of turning cow manure into methane, and using it for energy,\" Mr Ward said. \"And we got into a car and drove out in the middle of nowhere to go look at cow manure, at 1.30 in the morning. Most college speakers and politicians don't do that.\" Mr Ward became a follower and has spent his career as a consumer activist. Like so many other Raiders, he has joined the stop-Ralph effort. </p> <p>\"In his own mind, he thinks the risk of four more years of George W Bush is worth it to him. But how does that work, if by every single indicator it's done nothing?\" </p> <p>Some critics put his perseverance down to sheer ego. But an egoist would be unnerved by the rising chorus of denigration. Mr Nader's certainty is so strong that defeat only reinforces it. </p> <p>\"We lose to win, eventually,\" he told the New York Times. \"That's the story of social justice. You have to be willing to lose and fight, and lose and fight, and lose and fight. Until the agenda is won.\" </p> <p>However, former supporters see only a stubborn old man running on pride. </p> <p>\"It's the whole St Ralph syndrome. He's pure, and we're all corrupt. </p> <p>\"He's just out there somewhere where it can't be reached,\" Mr Moffett said. \"He's afraid something might be won in a marginal way. He's only for overwhelming victory.\" </p> <p><br><b> Born </b><br> February 27 1934, in Winsted, Connecticut, to Lebanese immigrants, Nathra and Rose Nader </p> <p><b> Education</b> <br>Graduated from Princeton in 1955 and Harvard law school in 1958.

  "<b>The present</b> <p> For me, though, the big question is why even those governments which have recognised that Britain cannot escape its European destiny - including, as I have said, the present one - always seem over time to retreat from their initial resolve. Think of John Major's \"Heart of Europe\" speech back in 1991, or Tony Blair's frequent promises to end once and for all the ambivalence and ambiguities that haunt our dealings with other European nations. Why is it that the French can be comfortable with being French and European while we still see a choice between the two? For as long as we define Britishness in opposition to Europeanism, we are doomed.</p> <p>I don't doubt the good intentions of the prime minister. He is more comfortable in his European skin than any of his predecessors since Edward Heath. He also has a huge majority in the House of Commons. So why have good intentions once again given way to political expediency? </p> <p>Iraq provides part of the explanation. But even before Mr Blair chose to stand alongside George W Bush there was ample evidence of the familiar backsliding.</p> <p>One reason - and here I am more sympathetic to pro-European politicians - is that there has rarely been a bipartisan consensus in Britain. In most other member states, the Union is woven into the political fabric. But if we look back on 30 years of Britain's membership there has been only one brief period - for two or three years after the referendum in 1975 - when both of the two largest parties have broadly agreed on Europe. </p> <p>By 1983 the Labour party, which had advocated a Yes vote in 1975, was calling for complete withdrawal from the Community. And by the time Neil Kinnock - with a little help from Jacques Delors - had persuaded his party that Europe was not a capitalist ramp, Margaret Thatcher had set the Conservatives on to their present trajectory. Mr Major's good intentions did not survive the Maastricht Treaty. </p> <p>Earlier this month I listened in despair as Michael Howard gave a speech at the Conservative party conference as hostile to the European Union as any I have heard. </p> <p>The great irony is that the Conservatives' journey along the road of Euroscepticism has coincided with a profound shift in the nature of the European Union. The Monnet vision has dimmed. </p> <p>Looking back we can see that the Maastricht Treaty represented the high water mark of federalist ambition. There has been nothing since comparable to the Single European Act negotiated by Margaret Thatcher. </p> <p>Enlargement to a Union of 25 has changed irreversibly the political geography of the Union. The Franco-German alliance is no longer sufficient to drive greater integration. And for all the faux alarmism of its opponents, the constitutional treaty codifies and entrenches the balance between the acquis communitaire and the intergovernmentalism promoted by Britain.</p> <p>Yet for as long as the European Union remains a political battleground at Westminster, the Europhobic press and that part of our political establishment and public opinion still trapped in the past has a powerful lever against pro-European governments such as that of Mr Blair. Mr Murdoch's influence on the present government - and it is painfully large - depends on the absence of bipartisan consensus.</p> <p>This though provides only part of the explanation of our reluctant Europeanism. Pro-Europeans need to admit a bigger failure, one that they will have to confront head on if the referendum on the constitutional treaty is to be won. The failure is to describe and explain Europe as it is - to admit that membership of this particular club does involve a diminution of what has been classically understood as national sovereignty and to persuade people that Britain is more prosperous and secure as a consequence. To borrow a phrase, the price is worth paying. </p> <p>From the very beginning those who march under a European flag have been less than honest about the nature of the bargain struck with our European neighbours and of the implications for national sovereignty. Thus the 1971 White Paper on entry declared:</p> <p>\"There is no question of any erosion of essential national sovereignty; what is proposed is a sharing and enlargement of individual national sovereignties in the general interest.\"</p> <p>A Sophist, or for that matter a Jesuit, could defend that particular linguistic construction. But to my mind it dodges a central reality. It represents the failure of nerve which lies at the very core of Britain's reluctant Europeanism. </p> <p> Sovereignty is the truly neuralgic word in this debate. </p> <p>It carries the implication - never properly challenged by pro-Europeans - that Britain does have a clear choice: it can opt for complete freedom of action outside the European Union or surrender its independence to Brussels. Sovereignty, in this mindset, is indivisible. Once passed to Brussels, it is lost to Britain. The debate about our relationship is thus held on ground chosen by Eurosceptics - the Union, they say, is a zero sum game; the only question is whether Britain emerges a winner or loser from the all-night bargaining sessions in Brussels. And more often than not, the sceptics will always claim, it is a loser.</p> <p>Never mind that this argument has long defied the realities of the modern world; that for a medium-sized nation on the edge of Europe, the option of independent action is a mirage. As Michael Heseltine once put it:</p> <p>\"A man alone in the desert is sovereign. He is also powerless.\" </p> <p>The same is true of governments. To consider almost any of the prime responsibilities of government - to provide security and freedom for the citizen, an economic framework in which people can prosper and a safety net for the disadvantaged - is to understand the interdependence that comes with globalisation. </p> <p>Think of the direct impact on Britain of the war in the Balkans, of war and famine in Somalia, of the backing for terrorism of the Taliban in Afghanistan. I keep hearing politicians of all parties insist that Britain will never cede immigration controls to Europe. But we all know, in a nation that has 90 million visitors every year, that control is illusory. It is no accident that the present government finally began to get a grip on the flow of asylum seekers into Britain only when France agreed to close the Sangatte camp outside Calais.</p> <p>To be fair, I have heard Mr Blair make this point about sovereignty - sometimes eloquently so. Thus in 2001 he told the European Research Institute in Birmingham:</p> <p>\"I see sovereignty not merely as the ability of a single country to say No, but as the power to maximise our national strength and capacity in business, trade, foreign policy, defence and the fight against crime. Sovereignty has to be deployed for national advantage. When we isolated ourselves in the past, we squandered our sovereignty - leaving us sole masters of a shrinking sphere of influence.\"</p> <p>My quarrel with the government lies in the distance between such analysis and day-to-day practice. Ministers all too often behave otherwise. Consider the monthly meetings of the Ecofin council of finance ministers. Before each such gathering the Treasury plants in the national press some story or other about how the chancellor is travelling to Brussels to tell his colleagues what's what, to veto this or that new directive, or to explain why Britain's economic policy is infinitely superior to that of other European governments. </p> <p>The temptation is to dismiss such behaviour as just silly - the Treasury at its puerile worst. But, month by month, it returns the argument about the EU to the Eurosceptics' chosen ground, feeding the delusion that Brussels is a plot against our national interest.</p> <p>So too does the language of \"red lines\" used by the government in the negotiations on the constitutional treaty. It is self-evident that every EU government set in advance its own demands and limits in the negotiations. France, for example, has long rejected the European superstate of the sceptics' nightmares. Yet Britain alone feels obliged to frame such bargaining in terms of lines beyond which it will never retreat instead of ground on which it would like to advance. Most of the European press described the outcome of the negotiations on the treaty as a triumph for the British vision of a Europe of nation states. But the government's own choice of language had already determined that the outcome would be seen at home as at best a limited defeat.</p> <p>This perception of Europe as a battleground seeps into the media. The other day the BBC announced a review of its European coverage. It intends to focus particularly on whether it gives due airtime to the Eurosceptics. I have no objection to such an analysis. But measuring how many minutes John Redwood gets to refute Kenneth Clarke seems to me to miss the point. </p> <p>The problem with the BBC's coverage - and, to be fair, that of much of the rest of the media - is that it too reports Europe in terms of them and us, of winning and losing. Rarely does the reporting acknowledge the deeper truth - that we cannot alone control our destiny and that, as Europeans, we can all benefit from shared decision-making.</p> <p>It seems to me that unless and until Britain's pro-Europeans take the sovereignty issue head on - until they explain that Britain cannot shape its own destiny alone and that the sovereignty so beloved of the Sun is a dangerous delusion - it will never be able to properly make the case for European engagement. That means too admitting that the EU is far from perfect - that sometimes the compromises are painful. The point is that, overall, the balance sheet is unequivocally positive. </p> <p><b>The future we cannot avoid </b></p> <p>The future, as Hugo said, is unavoidable.</p> <p>In a week or so the 25 members of the European Union are to put their signature to a new treaty of Rome. This time Britain will be there. But hardly with enthusiasm. When we look around the world everything tells us that we need more Europe rather than less if Britain's national interests are to be advanced. It has always struck me as ironic that the global economic liberalism that Conservatives have espoused since the 1980s has greatly strengthened the case for the political cooperation they abhor. </p> <p>No one can imagine after the events of 11 September 2001 that we are masters of our own security in the face of the threat from al-Qaida terrorism and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; few can believe that we can control immigration and asylum flows without the cooperation of our European partners; nor tackle cross-border crime without more coordination between police and judicial authorities across the continent. </p> <p>Climate change reminds us that the environment has no respect for national borders. We need the European Union to promote further liberalisation of world trade to the mutual advantage of poor and rich nations. Alone, Britain would never be heard in the Doha round of trade negotiations; the Union is listened to attentively. </p> <p> As Peter Mandelson has recently said, the emergence of China and India as great economic powers demands more rather than less coherence in Europe if the continent's interests are to be protected.</p> <p>Consider too the competition for energy as demand increases for the world's fossil fuel supplies. Those resources are concentrated in the Gulf, Russia and West Africa and our relationship with those regions will be critical for our future energy security. Britain - or for that matter any other single European country - cannot manage those relationships alone.</p> <p>Interdependence has long been a fact of life. It will become more rather than less so in the coming decades.</p> <p>The painful paradox facing Mr Blair is that he started out in 10 Downing Street determined to rebuild Britain's relations with Europe and has ended up as a prime minister more committed to a special relationship with Washington than any but Margaret Thatcher. </p> <p>A vital lesson of the Iraq war should be that we need Europe in order to have a balanced relationship with Washington - an alliance, as Mr Blair has said, based on partnership rather than subservience. I do not doubt that Mr Bush has genuinely appreciated Mr Blair's support. And I have heard senior American officials say that we British have tended to underestimate the influence the prime minister has exercised in the White House. But we should not delude ourselves that the American approach to the relationship with the UK is anything but ruthlessly utilitarianism. US foreign policy has never left room for sentimentalism. </p> <p>And looking at Mr Bush's handling of the most pressing security issues of our times - the rising insurgency in Iraq, the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, Iran's nuclear ambitions among them - I would be surprised if Mr Blair would claim much of the credit for present US policy. </p> <p>I do not count myself among those who believe that we in Britain have to make an existential choice between the US and Europe - that to be full participating members of the European Union demands that we make enemies of our friends in Washington. </p> <p>Rather, I agree with the prime minister that Britain's economic and security interests lie in an Atlanticist European Union. And looking around the European Union of 25 we can see plenty of others who share that basic ambition - Germany and Italy as well as the former communist states of central and eastern Europe. I also share some of Mr Blair's doubts about Jacques Chirac's multi-polar world. Is French obsequiousness in Beijing so obviously preferable to British deference in Washington? The transatlantic community of values is sometimes exaggerated, but I fail to see how a Europe detached from America could feel more secure. </p> <p>For all that, our reflexes need to be as European as they are American - Britain cannot continue to define its ambitions in Europe in terms of what is acceptable in Washington. </p> <p>Gerhard Schr&amp;oumlder is right when he says the traffic on Mr Blair's bridge is too often one way. The government takes America's views to the capitals of Europe. It should more often take Europe's views to Washington.</p> <p>Another paradox. The future of Britain's place in Europe is now enmeshed in the outcome of the US presidential election on November 2. The conventional wisdom is that a victory for George Bush would be politically the most comfortable for Mr Blair. In fact, the prime minister needs John Kerry to win. A Democratic White House would give Mr Blair an opportunity to rebalance Britain's twin relationships with Europe and the US. The transatlantic alliance cannot now be resurrected in its postwar form. The collapse of communism dissolved the glue long provided by the Soviet threat. Europe is no longer at the centre of America's geopolitical interests; and the American guarantee is no longer the sine qua non of European security. But a Kerry presidency would provide the opportunity for, if not the certainty of, a new relationship between the US and Europe. Britain's strategic interests still lie firmly in the re-establishment of a cohesive alliance, in the rebuilding at both ends of Mr Blair's bridge across the Atlantic.</p> <p>That in turn also requires that the government wins the referendum on the proposed constitutional treaty.</p> <p>So can the British people be convinced? Here, I am at once pessimistic and optimistic.</p> <p>Pessimistic because, like everyone else, I read the opinion polls. </p> <p>And because, for all the fanfare of the prime minister's statement to the House of Commons last April, I see no evidence that the government is mobilising the Yes vote. The word from Downing Street is that nothing serious is to be said about the referendum until after the general election - Mr Murdoch's malevolent influence again. Mr Blair promises then to work his persuasive magic. He might have learned by now that the magic has faded. Even, as I suspect it will be, if the referendum is delayed until mid-2006, the campaign to win it must start now. Instead, the government leaves its pro-European case to speeches delivered by Dennis MacShane on the occasional wet night in Dudley. </p> <p>Yet I am optimistic because in spite of the message of the opinion polls, I suspect that the British electorate has more common sense on this issue than we give it credit for. Look beyond the saloon bar xenophobia of UKIP and most people do not find it that difficult to reconcile their Britishness with the idea that we are part of a larger construct. England's national football team is managed by a Swede, its most successful premiership club by a Frenchman. Where are the demonstrations on the streets against German ownership of Rolls Royce or a Spanish takeover of one of our biggest banks? </p> <p>If the referendum is framed, as it must be, in terms of a choice between continued active involvement in the EU and isolation on the margins of an organisation that nonetheless shapes our future, most voters may well conclude, as they did in 1975, that their heads should rule their hearts. The message that the Yes camp must convey - and it has the virtue of being the honest one - is that the status quo option in the referendum is to ratify the treaty. </p> <p> The British do not want to be isolated. </p> <p>Only the other day William Hague recalled that during the 2001 election campaign he had invited the voters to follow him in saving Britain from the European dragon. In Mr Hague's own candid admission: \"No one came\". </p> <p>That says to me that British pragmatism is alive and well; that, for all that some would like to think that our island status gives us a unique freedom of action, we know that the reality is otherwise.</p> <p>Lord Palmerston famously remarked that Britain did not have allies, only interests. The facts of the modern world are such that interests can only be pursued through alliances.</p> <p>As Hugo so eloquently reminded us, we may be unable to forget the past, but nor can we avoid the future.</p> <p>Thank you.</p>",
  "The claim that the US president and his contender for office are at the whim of Mr Sharon takes conspiracy theories to a new level of absurdity (Bush and Kerry dance to the tune of Ariel Sharon, October 20).

  "Jonathan Freedland (Faith against reason, October 20) touches on the true danger US politics is beginning to pose. Bush's war in Iraq and atrocious environmental policies are only symptoms of a larger, more terrifying trend - the shift towards conservatism in the US. As a US citizen, I have had the displeasure of living through the beginning of this trend ever since 9/11. The combination of a Christian revival, along with an intense fear, has caused our misguided citizens to flock to the right. <p>But the left cannot be absolved of responsibility. While the ideologues of the right have screamed from their mansions, the left has sat in silence. As an undergraduate at Harvard, this could not be more apparent. The undergraduate body is overwhelmingly liberal, yet the flyers that stand out on our billboards all over campus are those advocating conservative ideals such as pro-life. We have countless liberal student groups, yet it is Harvard College Republicans that we hear from. </p> <p>The true danger is not particular policies such as Iraq, but what fuels support for such policies, for it is this that will continue to elect leaders like Bush, beyond his maximum two terms.<br> <b> Eric Biewener</b><br> Galway, Ireland </p> <p>A victory for Bush would be a disaster, but you overstate the case (Leaders, October 19). To say \"the Democratic party cannot survive\" a Bush victory is hyperbolic, as the Labour party showed by emerging from a much more desolate wilderness. </p> <p>George Bush is an unqualified, ignorant, aggressive, dishonest president, and I dread the prospect of four more years of his poor leadership. But to caricature him as wishing to turn \"America into a closed theocracy at war with all who differ with the administration\" is over the top. The real danger, of an America run by a self-interested, self-satisfied clique, paying for further ideologically - and financially - motivated military adventurism by soaring deficit spending, is reason enough for Ralph Nader to step aside and wholeheartedly support Kerry.<br> <b>Martin Coleman</b><br> Brooklyn, New York </p> <p>I'm sick of people who say a vote for Nader is a vote for Bush. It seems to me a vote for Kerry is a vote for Bush - they agree on so many of the major issues. They are both for the war in Iraq (lest we forget, Kerry voted for it). They are both for the Patriot Act (Kerry voted for that, too). Kerry and Bush are both for Nafta and fully support the WTO. They are both for the death penalty. They are both against legalising gay marriage and both against universal healthcare for all under a single-payer system. They are both against raising the minimum wage to a living wage of $10 an hour; they both support the failed war on drugs. The list goes on. </p> <p>The only way to stop the madness is to vote for Nader. When Kerry loses the election, the Democratic party will become a long-overdue footnote in American politics. It's time for change.<br> <b>Dominick Piizzi</b><br> Cranford, New Jersey </p> <p>I am a black Londoner who has lived in the Paris region for over two years. I too have noticed how the mounting racism here is eating away at the entrails of French democracy (Spread of racism 'could kill French democracy', October 20). This problem might become one for the world. I believe French racism arises from a feeling of inferiority vis-\u00e0-vis America and the growing dominance of the English language.

  "In 1957, at Windscale (now part of the Sellafield site) in Cumbria, Britain's only major nuclear incident occurred. This led the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority to establish at Risley, near Warrington, what became the Safety and Reliability Directorate, and in 1958 John Ablitt, who has died aged 85, set up the team that initially carried out the independent safety assessments of the Dounreay, Calder Hall and Chapelcross reactors. <p>The fruit of his work was an incredibly detailed safety and reliability methodology. It rapidly became an international, industry-wide standard applied in such diverse fields as transport and chem ical manufacture. </p> <p>Ablitt had joined the Harwell nuclear laboratory in 1951 as an engineering control officer on the British Experimental Pile, \"0\" (Bepo) research reactor, becoming head of the design office two years later. His work included the production of isotopes for medical use, and his team designed supplementary equipment for the Dido heavy-water research reactor. One of the biggest challenges was the design of an experimental station in Bepo (codenamed Pippa) to simulate the conditions in what was to be in 1956 the world's first fully commercial nuclear power plant at Calder Hall. </p> <p>Ablitt was born in Romford, Essex, the descendant of an 18th-century Suffolk clockmaker of the same name and the son of an engineer on the Greater India Peninsular Railway. His parents returned with him to India when he was only a few months old. He enjoyed the freedom of his early years near Bombay, but, aged 13, began boarding at the Lancaster Royal grammar school, excelling at sports, and particularly rugby. </p> <p>He then began an engineering apprenticeship but, in September 1939, with the second world war beginning, he volunteered for the Royal Artillery (RA) since he thought that there would be \"a lot more science in it\" than in the infantry. In early 1941, he was shipped out to India as a commissioned officer and posted, with 157th Field Regiment, as part of General William Slim's \"Paiforce\" into Iraq, to Basra, Baghdad, Fallujah - where a skirmish with Iraqi troops ensued - Kirkuk and Mosul. The latter two were particularly important - as they still are- in terms of oil supplies. </p> <p>Neighbouring Syria was then still controlled by troops loyal to Marshal P\u00e9tain's Vichy French collaborationist regime. Ablitt and his battery were part of a brigade group, which, at Deir-ez-Zor, fought a brisk battle against the Vichyites. Despite Ablitt and his comrades being outgunned, their demoralised opponents gave up. </p> <p>In 1942, in north Africa, Ablitt, as part of 164th Field Regiment, led his men through Italian lines to escape from encirclement at Mersa Matruh. He then went on to see action at El Alamein, the invasion of Sicily, the Normandy beaches, and Arnhem, often putting himself in great danger as a forward spotter for the guns. Following the 1945 Rhine crossings, Ablitt was mentioned in despatches after he and two of his men, finding themselves behind the German lines, continued to direct fire while fighting off the enemy. </p> <p> S oon after, word reached him that another RA unit had discovered something terrible near the German town of Bergen. It was the first concentration camp to be liberated by the western allies, Bergen-Belsen. Enraged, Ablitt was among those who made the local burgomaster and the town's residents help bury the emaciated corpses in mass graves. </p> <p>After the war, Ablitt - by now an acting Major - refreshed his engineering knowledge at Biarritz's International University, established by the US forces. He then used an ex-servicemen's grant to read mechanical engineering at Manchester University. Harwell followed. </p> <p>He was a lifelong socialist and a very popular man. He also had a wicked sense of humour. Sometimes, however, the tables were turned. At Harwell, he had designed a system - nicknamed \"Rabbit\" - for rapid tube transit of radioactive isotopes for more than a mile across the site. At his Harwell leaving dinner, a pipe was run into the dining room up to his table and a rabbit, duly inserted at one end, subsequently emerged at his feet. It ended its days as a family pet. </p> <p>In retirement, Ablitt pursued a passion for caravanning. This entailed leading large parties of caravans to his beloved Spain and also as far afield as the most northerly part of Europe, Norway's North Cape, and north Africa. </p> <p>He is survived by his wife Betty, whom he married in 1943, and by a son and daughter. </p> <p>\u00b7 John Frederick Ablitt, engineer, born August 30 1919; died October 11 2004</p>",

  "<b> Suzanne Goldenberg</b> <p> </p> <p> George Bush suffered an embarrassing rebellion in the ranks yesterday when the founder of the conservative Christian Coalition said the White House had dismissed the very idea of US casualties in Iraq during the run-up to the war. </p> <p>In an interview with CNN, the movement's founder, Pat Robertson, described a conversation with Mr Bush shortly before the war in which Mr Robertson voiced his fears for American troops, and suggested it was time to prepare the country for loss.</p> <p>\"I warned him about this war. I had deep misgivings about this war, deep misgivings. And I was trying to say, 'Mr President, you had better prepare the American people for casualties,'\" Mr Robertson said. He said Mr Bush had replied: \"Oh, no, we're not going to have any casualties.\"</p> <p>The rare criticism from Mr Robertson, who otherwise remains an ardent supporter of the White House, was not the only act of betrayal by those claiming proximity to Mr Bush.</p> <p>Six of the president's kin have created a website called bushrelativesforkerry.com dedicated to the defeat of their famous relative. \"Because blood is thinner than oil,\" the front page says. \"Please don't vote for our cousin.\"</p> <p>The six are all descendants of Mary Bush House, the sister of Prescott Bush, the founder of the political dynasty and George W's grandfather. None has had any contact with the president, although a few knew his father, the first president Bush.</p> <p>They accuse their cousin of gross arrogance, a misplaced sense of entitlement, and failing to live up to Christian values.</p> <p>\"As much as I'd like to vote for a relative running for president, I just can't,\" writes Hilary House.</p> <p>But the family feud, though annoying for Mr Bush, is unlikely to have anything near the impact of the criticism from a figure with Mr Robert son's influence on the Christian right.</p> <p>He has voiced doubts about the war in the past, but his decision to speak out uncompromisingly now - less than a fortnight before polling day - may deliver a serious setback to a Republican election strategy that hinges on turning out the 4 million evangelical Christians who stayed at home in 2000.</p> <p>The televangelist also told CNN yesterday that he wished the president would admit to making mistakes, and suggested that his frustrations had been growing.</p> <p>\"The Lord told me it was going to be A, a disaster, and B, messy,\" Mr Robertson said. \"I warned him about casualties.\"</p>",
  "<p>It depends on who you are. As far as the British government goes, scientists in this country will still be allowed to do therapeutic cloning regardless of what the UN says. But in the US, cloning has become an election issue. If the UN comes out against all forms of cloning, it could bolster the Bush administration's stance and make Democratic candi date John Kerry's progressive policies tougher to introduce. </p> <p>Countries are due to finish voting at a UN debate on cloning today. They have two choices: President Bush is calling for delegates to support a proposal from Costa Rica to ban both therapeutic and reproductive cloning. The UK, meanwhile, is backing a Belgian proposal to ban human reproductive cloning but allow individual countries to decide about therapeutic cloning for themselves. Human reproductive cloning - the creation of cloned babies - is already illegal in the UK, while therapeutic cloning to produce stem cells, the master cells of the human body, is allowed though tightly regulated. </p> <p>This week, Britain's most prestigious scientific body, the Royal Society, called on the UN to ignore Bush's call to ban cloning entirely, and warned that a botched ban could have serious consequences. \"The danger of an unworkable resolution on human cloning is that maverick scientists, including those already claiming to be carrying out such work, will attempt reproductive cloning in countries that have not passed laws against it,\" said Bob May, president of the society. </p> <p>\"From a world perspective, the vote matters because if the UN comes out against something, that doesn't help it anywhere,\" says Chris Higgins, director of clinical sciences at the Medical Research Council. But in Britain, at least, the outcome of the UN vote is all but immaterial. The Department of Health says: \"We wouldn't support any move to ban therapeutic cloning and if the UN tries to ban it, we wouldn't agree to it\". </p> <p>The picture is very different in the US, though, where Kerry's views are directly opposed to Bush's. \"This is a big political issue in the States now,\" says Higgins. \"Kerry's made a big play on how he wants this research to prosper. What would he do if the UN opposed it? Presumably it would be very difficult to reverse what Bush has already put in place.\"</p>",

One interesting aspect of the campaign is that nobody's really sure. <p>One theory - which you might call the \"George W Kerry\" theory after an <a href=\"http://foreignpolicy.com/story/files/story2557.php?PHPSESSID=1a90f817f61c2fff32a9ffc0008b198d\">article</a> by that title in the journal Foreign Policy - is that Kerry will be more like Bush than most of his supporters suppose. </p> <p>In that article, author Moises Naim argues that the president whom Kerry will most resemble - at least in terms of foreign policy - is the one we've got now, and that, paradoxically, if re-elected President Bush will be more like Kerry than he is today: \"If re-elected, Bush will have difficulty sustaining the foreign policies of his first term, whereas a first-term Kerry presidency is bound to emulate some of Bush's more aggressive positions.\"</p> <p>There's some truth to this. Presidents are powerful, but they are also influenced by the world, and neither the world, nor America's interests in it, change as much as people think from one election cycle to another. Nixon, remember, ran as a \"peace candidate\" in 1968, but was still fighting LBJ's war in 1972. And although George W Bush invaded Iraq, Bill Clinton threatened to, and even, in 1998, signed the <a href=\"http://www.library.cornell.edu/colldev/mideast/libera.htm\">Iraq Liberation Act,</a> which made regime change official US policy. </p> <p>Another thing that may drive Kerry toward Bush's positions is that his approach of winning help from allies in Iraq seems to have come a cropper, with both Germany and France making clear that they won't be sending troops to Iraq even if Kerry is elected. </p> <p>That will leave Kerry with a choice of relying on George W Bush's anglosphere-heavy coalition, now strengthened by the Australian prime minister, John Howard's, recent election victory, which has left Howard (along with Tony Blair) <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,5744,11102193%255E7583,00.html\">far more important</a> to US relations, and world events, than France and Germany anyway.</p> <p>Kerry's other choice might be to withdraw. Let's call this the \"James Earl Kerry\" theory, after a column that I wrote a while back suggesting that Kerry might wind up like <a href=\"http://msnbc.msn.com/id/4924762/#040514\">Jimmy Carter:</a></p> <blockquote> <p>I think it's fair to say that if Kerry wins, he'll win based on anti-Bush sentiment among Democrats and swing voters. But although the anybody-but-Bush vote might be good enough to get him into office, once he's elected it will evaporate: the dump-Bush voters will have gotten what they wanted, and they won't have any special reason to support any particular policy of Kerry's - or even Kerry himself ...</p> <p>So Kerry might find himself elected, but with support that rapidly fades away, leaving him subject to Washington crosswinds and a slave to his party's interest groups. That's pretty much what happened to President Jimmy Carter. He owed his election to backlash over Gerald Ford's pardon of Richard Nixon and the lingering residue of Watergate. But that turned out to be an insufficient base on which to govern. Carter's own party (especially, though not only, rivals like Ted Kennedy) cut him to ribbons. We lost ground both at home and abroad as a result.</p> </blockquote> <p>This was recently echoed by The Economist's \"Lexington\" column, which <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/World/na/displayStory.cfm?story_id=3286037\">observed:</a></p> <blockquote> <p>Because the election is largely a referendum on Mr Bush, he can claim, if he wins, a clear mandate for his policies - particularly cutting taxes at home and smiting terrorists abroad. If Mr Kerry wins, the only mandate he will have will be for not being George Bush. In 1993, Mr Clinton had a difficult enough time holding his party together despite laying out a compelling vision of a new Democratic Party. The singularly unvisionary Mr Kerry will have to deal not just with the same struggles (for instance, between healthcare reformers and deficit hawks) but also with a new civil war between the party's rabid Michael Moore faction and its more sensible Tony Blair wing.</p> </blockquote> <p>That's probably right. (If Bush wins, there will be a struggle within the Republican party, between its libertarian small-government and traditionalist social-conservative wings, too, but it will be more muted and it's unlikely to involve the war, as national security is the glue that holds Bush's coalition together, in the same way that Bush-hatred is holding Kerry's together. The difference is, one is likely to survive the election, and the other isn't.)</p> <p>Of course, if Kerry can't count on support within his own party, he might reach out to Republicans who support the war. </p> <p>That produces a scenario that might be named \"Lyndon Baines Kerry,\" after Lyndon Baines Johnson, the last President to brag about his Silver Star. (Though LBJ's medal was <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2001/johnson.silver.star/story/storypage.html\">less credible</a> than Kerry's). </p> <p>Like Kerry, LBJ was a domestically oriented politician with foreign affairs problems. Also like Kerry, LBJ seemed anxious to demonstrate his manliness in a variety of settings - with LBJ it was cowboy hats, sexual braggadocio, loud cursing, and constant flaunting of his Silver Star, while with Kerry it's motorcycles, electric guitars, and, er, constant flaunting of his Silver Star.</p> <p>Would fear of seeming like a wimp lead Kerry to escalate the war on terror rather than pursuing the cut-and-run strategy that many of us expect will mark a Kerry Presidency? Good question. That might actually dispose me to feel better about the prospect of Kerry winning, though I'd prefer a president who pursued war with cold-blooded focus rather than one who pursued it for egotistical reasons. </p> <p>But in a way, the questions about Kerry say more than their answers might.</p> <p>Kerry's big problem is that all of these scenarios are plausible, because his approach has been so unfocused that nobody knows where he'll come down in the end. (His talk of a \"secret plan to end the war\" has even spurred <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4994348/#040520\">comparisons with Richard Nixon,</a> who made similar promises when he ran in 1968). </p> <p>And that uncertainty bodes poorly for his prospects of winning in general. While there may be some people who want \"anybody but Bush\", most voters want to vote for somebody - not everybody.</p> <p><b><b>\u00b7</b></b> Glenn Reynolds, a law professor at the University of Tennessee, runs the <a href=\"http://www.instapundit.com/\">instapundit.com</a> US political blog.</p> <p><b><b>\u00b7</b></b> Comment on this article <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/news/archives/us_elections/2004/10/george_w_kerry.html\">here</a>.</p>",
  "<p>Nuclear terrorism is a horrifying possibility, but it needn't be a paralysing one. That's the message of a new book, Nuclear Terrorism: The ultimate preventable catastrophe, by Graham Allison. He begins by sketching a realistic scenario in which as many as a million lives could be lost following explosion of a nuclear device in a large American city. </p> <p>Understandably, most of us would rather talk about anything else. Unpleasant though it is, we should pay attention to the feasible steps that Allison argues can greatly reduce the probability of such an attack - which has become a key US election issue. </p> <p>Compared to the cost in human life, financial resources and international goodwill of the Iraq war, Allison argues that these steps are almost cheap. Formerly dean of Harvard's Kennedy School of Government and assistant secretary of defence for policy and plans in the first Clinton administration, the professor backs up his dire warnings with considerable expertise. </p> <p>The heart of the book is Allison's list of the three Nos necessary to avoid calamity: no loose nukes, no new nukes, no new nuclear states. </p> <p>The first, most important \"no\" requires that the US help secure Russia's poorly guarded stockpiles of fissile material (enriched uranium and plutonium) and nuclear weapons. Of particular concern is its supply of so-called suitcase nuclear bombs, many of which are unaccounted for. </p> <p>Securing the stockpiles is being done in a limited way under the auspices of the Nunn-Lugar Act, which was passed by Congress for this purpose. Allison argues, however, that it will take 13 years to secure all Russia's fissile material at the rate we're going, and that we should spend the money to help them do the job in four years. (This position is endorsed by the Kerry campaign, to which Allison is a consultant). </p> <p>Obtaining fissile material is the primary difficulty facing those trying to make a weapon. But with enough enriched uranium or plutonium, some knowledge of physics, and a little internet surfing, a crude weapon can be made in less than a year. The unfortunate fact is that in Russia there is enough fissile material vulnerable to theft to make 30,000 additional nuclear weapons. </p> <p>Furthermore, though it contains 90% of all existing fissile material outside the US, Russia is not the only worry. About 25 of the 130 nuclear research reactors in 40 countries contain sufficient fissile material to produce at least one nuclear bomb. </p> <p> The second \"no\" requires that we ensure more fissile material is not produced by countries such as Iran, whose generators' avowed rationale is the peaceful production of electricity. Allison recommends strengthening the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty terms. Incentives might include a programme in which countries with nuclear capabilities sell enriched uranium to those countries that want electricity from nuclear reactors. </p> <p>Allison's third No requires that we limit the nuclear club to the present eight members (the US, Russia, Britain, France, China, Pakistan, India and Israel). Both Iran and North Korea must be persuaded to give up their nuclear aspirations. Pressure must continue to be carefully applied to Pakistan, whose black marketers have been selling \"nuclear starter kits\" and consulting services. </p> <p>All three of these \"nos\" require \"muscular diplomacy\". Given the way the US is viewed around the world, this will be more difficult than otherwise. This fact is at the root of Allison's contention that the Bush administration has misplaced priorities, and has squandered opportunities to improve national security. </p> <p>Implementation will be expensive. Allison's estimate of the cost of securing all fissile material in the world is $30bn (\u00a316bn), although eliminating more extreme vulnerabilities would cost considerably less. Work must be done in the US, too.As Allison notes, 30,000 lorries, 6,500 railway wagons and 140 ships bring in 50,000 cargo containers to the US every day, of which only one in 20 is screened. </p> <p>Although crediting the Bush administration for quickly recognising the nexus between terrorism and nuclear weapons, Allison decries its \"absence of urgency\" in dealing with nuclear proliferation. </p> <p>A few of the book's premises, facts and conclusions may be questioned, but Nuclear Terrorism has a subtitle that everyone should take seriously. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> John Allen Paulos is a professor of mathematics at Temple University, Philadelphia, and bestselling author of Innumeracy and A Mathematician Plays the Stock Market. <a href=\"http://www.math.temple.edu/paulos\">www.math.temple.edu/paulos</a></p>",

  "<b>Dear Clark County voter<br> From Phil Mountain, Casnewydd, Wales</b> <br> I'm a cartographer who specialises in digital mapping. Parts of the US are almost as familiar to me as Wales. It's a small country but it was the ancestral home of 18 out of the 56 delegates who signed your Declaration of Independence. There are, however, more substantial historical connections which link me and my family to the United States. <p>My great-great-grandfather and his brother left Wales in the 1890s and settled in Cambrian County, Pennsylvania; your neighbouring state. Later, an elder brother of my grandfather enlisted in the US Navy. In December 1941, as a Lieutenant Commander, he was stationed at Pearl Harbor where he was wounded during the Japanese attack. He's buried in the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, Oahu. Another of his brothers was lost at sea when the ship in which he was sailing was torpedoed by a U-boat in the Atlantic en route between North America and Europe. </p> <p>So somewhere in the US I have relatives, perhaps more than I have here at home, a story which will be echoed many times throughout Europe. One thing is certain: we are all grateful for the individual sacrifices made by American families in the two world wars; our families have shared in those sacrifices in defence of liberty. We therefore have a close, sometimes personal, interest in how the world's foremost democracy conducts its affairs and presents itself to the world. </p> <p>However, we are now engaged in the wrong war for the wrong reasons and we were both lied to. Our family have a direct involvement. My youngest cousin, who unlike his brother, father and grandfather joined the army instead of going to sea, is a sergeant in the Queen's Dragoon Guards, an armoured regiment, and has served in both wars in Iraq. Brave people like him and his American counterparts should not be sacrificed because of the mendacity of our leaders. I'm sure many American families feel the same. It is also clear that organisations and individuals intimately connected to the Republican party and the president are making a lot of money off the back of this conflict. It looks to an outsider as if the temple of democracy is being abandoned to the moneylenders. </p> <p>On both sides of the Atlantic, my family have been miners and mariners, they were hard-working people who suffered much privation but their sacrifices and determination made our lives easier. I'm afraid that President Bush is taking us back to those often grim times. If you and I disagree and my letter has caused offence, I apologise again and close with the words of one of your greatest presidents, Thomas Jefferson: \"Error of opinion may be tolerated where reason is left free to combat it.\" I hope reason prevails.</p> <p><b>From Tom O'Donnell, Dorset</b><br> Please, change the world by changing the man in the White House. </p> <p><b>From Maria Celina McCall, Uruguay</b><br> I remember sitting in my junior high school classroom in November 1963, when a nun came in to call us to the chapel to pray for the president of the US who had just been shot and was fighting for his life. I remember sitting for two days watching on TV and crying like I had never cried before, just like I cried on September 11 when the twin towers collapsed. </p> <p>I have loved America ever since, and it is because of this love, that I write to you today. Because I'm saddened to what is happening to America's image abroad and the hatred I see all around me. </p> <p>I don't know if you are a father, but if you are old enough to vote, you may know by experience, that punishments don't lead you anywhere, and that dialogue is a better way to solve problems. Dialogue is what Mr Kerry is offering and that is what the world needs now. </p> <p>I would please beg you to vote for all of us that cannot, but whose lives are affected by the decisions taken by the leader of the free world. Please vote for life and freedom. </p> <p><b>From Mohsin Talukdar, Edinburgh</b><br> I am Mohsin Talukdar from Bangladesh, currently residing in great Britain. A non-practising Muslim by faith; although faith is very important to me, I feel comfortable believing in God and being a human being practising humanity. </p> <p>I remember the US Navy coming to Bangladesh to help flood victims in the mid-80s they did a splendid job. Since then, I wondered a lot about the US. I want to visit the Statue of Liberty some day (I read the translation of the script engraved at the bottom of the statue when I was in high school, it fascinated me). It even fascinates me more now but the very thing makes the Statue of Liberty a beacon to humanity is very much threatened from outside and as well as within. That worries me a lot as a believer in humanity. </p> <p>I can remember 9/11 very vividly. It seemed surreal, felt stupid, because I can't reason through, as a Muslim, how it was supposed to voice any concern that the Muslim might have. </p> <p>When US forces were fighting in Afghanistan, I felt like fighting alongside them, wished them all the best from the bottom of my heart. It might not be possible for me to understand the complete impact that 9/11 had on America. I can understand one thing for sure - that the terrorist shouldn't win in any way because of what they did and are still doing. But it seems they are succeeding, they changed your law curbing fundamental rights and it seems still more to come.They succeeded in making the US deeply divided perhaps also made US somewhat distant from the rest of the world; whereas your constitution recognises being a part of the world community. That's why I fail to understand when George Bush says that the US shouldn't worry about anything it does for security; well, if you have your friends neutralised that can't be much of a security! </p> <p>I don't know whom you'll vote for, even if it doesn't seem right to vote for a change, but please know this, from outside it seems very much that we need your vote, America needs your vote. It's not about Kerry, Bush or Democrats, Republicans; it's about how as human beings we'll choose to deal with things. </p> <p><b>From Marc Puttock, Leicester</b><br> I am writing to you because I care about America a great deal. Let me tell you why. I lived and worked in the USA for 22 years. My dearest friends are American and some of my best memories are of July 4th parties, Memorial Day picnics, and the Thanksgiving feasts partaken with the welcoming families of friends. I close my eyes and I still see the woods and lakes of Connecticut where I spent so much of my time. </p> <p>Living in America from 1978 through to 2000 and I went through the changes along with everyone else: from the Iran-hostage crisis to the Iran-Contra scandal, the attempt on Reagan's life, the OJ Simpson verdict, the Gulf war. </p> <p>All these events would be discussed around the watercooler with colleagues whether I was working in factories or in offices. Opinions were divided, discussion sometimes heated, but at no time was that essential hope dimmed and at no time did I feel a fear for the future from those with whom I spoke. </p> <p>Sadly, that has altered. I started working back in the UK in 2000. With the distance that comes from separation, I would return to the US and feel the difference in attitudes following the calamitous events of the destruction of the World Trade Centre in New York. It was not 9/11 that changed the American outlook however. I believe that it was the response to 9/11 by its leadership that has caused this bleakness to manifest itself in the American consciousness. The war on terrorism and the climate of fear generated from the Office of Homeland Security were used to subvert American awareness and enabled the Bush-led Republican government to pursue the war in Iraq without opposition from within. </p> <p>This is why I am writing to you to ask for your help in turning the tide. </p> <p>I truly believe that we all cannot afford another four years of Mr Bush being in power. </p> <p>I have never done anything like this before and I, myself, might resent the intrusion in receiving a letter like this. Forgive me, then, please. My motivation is not driven by anyone else or by a pressure group, I am simply someone who misses the America that I knew and loved. </p> <p><b>From Ilona Bossanyi, France</b><br> I'm taking the liberty of asking you, a citizen of a country built upon the principles of democracy but whose very might is in danger of disenfranchising the rest of the world, to use your right to vote, and to vote with all your heart and your mind, in your own name but also in the name of all those millions of people who will be looking to your decision in two weeks' time. </p> <p><b>From Mark Brown, London</b><br> I don't feel entirely comfortable with writing this letter: normally I would feel to offer my opinion on another country's politics to a citizen of that country would be wrong. Yet, as a British citizen I can't help but get involved in a decision that will not only affect the people of your country but many, many others around the world, none more so than my own. </p> <p>Earlier this year my father and I visited New York for a five-day break, neither of us had been before. We had a fantastic time and thought the place was truly breathtaking, yet the one thing that struck us most was the warmth and friendship shown to us everywhere we went. One night that sticks in the memory is a visit to The Boston Comedy Club in Greenwich Village. The comedian did that usual routine of asking which members of the audience weren't from New York, we ever-so-Britishly raised our hands politely and said in hushed tones we were from England. Later, drinks were sent to our table from a group in the corner, something neither of us had ever experienced nor will we forget. The kindness shown to us by everyone we encountered is probably the thing we remember most about our trip. </p> <p>The unity so prominent in the days after 9/11 is now shattered, a wealth of sympathy squandered as our governments continue to lie and justify the wholly unjust crimes we have committed. World anger is rising. </p> <p>On November 2 you will be asked to cast what may possibly be the most important vote of recent times. I am not asking you to vote for John Kerry nor am I asking you to vote for President Bush, all I ask is that you read this letter and consider that your vote affects us all, our future and our children's future. </p> <p><b>From Ed Kite, Stoke-on-Trent</b><br> The American people like to see things through. What was started should be finished. Don't change the general in mid campaign! </p> <p>But that's what we British did in 1940. The man who had miscalculated, Neville Chamberlain, got the boot. He whose leadership had led to a series of disasters was shown the door. A man who hitherto had been very unpopular, Winston Churchill, was given a chance. and the world knows that the future was changed forever. </p> <p>To me, America is in a similar situation now. </p> <p><b>From Stuart Riches, Bedfordshire</b><br> We are different, you and I. You are an American citizen and I am not. And yet we share the pretext that we are both citizens of the free world, living in a democracy with the opportunity to vote for our respective leaders. </p> <p>I am writing to you in the hope that it may encourage you to use your vote in the forthcoming presidential election. But, why would I do this? The answer is simple, because yes, although it is a very strange thing to do, it will help me clear my own conscience with respect to the war in Iraq. You see I am one of those who, when the protests were made in London, thought about it and did not take part. I was fairly sure at the time that the war was a bad idea, but I also believed that Iraq probably did have weapons of mass destruction, and although it was not an immediate threat it probably could become one at short notice. What I believe now is very different. </p> <p>I am now prepared to stand up and be counted. I hope that you will feel the same.</p>",
  "Blimey. I think I have an idea as to how Dr Frankenstein felt. By the beginning of this week, a quixotic idea dreamed up last month in a north London pub had morphed into a global media phenomenon complete with transatlantic outrage, harrumphing over journalistic ethics, grave political predictions - and thousands of people from every corner of the planet writing personal, passionate letters to voters in a tiny American district few outside Ohio had heard of 10 days ago. <p>I realised just how much momentum our project to match concerned non-Americans with voters in a marginal US county had acquired when I arrived in Shanghai on Sunday to be handed a message from a local reporter. I rang back expecting a few desultory questions about why a group of Guardian journalists were visiting China but the reporter had a bigger story in her sights: \"Is it possible to make interview about Operation Clark County?\" (There was no sign in her voice of the mild irony with which we had chosen the project's quasi-military name.) When I rang a colleague in London the next morning to tell him about the strangely surreal encounter, he reported that he had just said goodbye to a crew from Japanese TV. CNN were on their way. </p> <p>It's been like that for the best part of a week: Canadian newspapers, Irish radio, US TV networks. Fox has been frothing. Rush Limbaugh has been raving. A quick Google search as I write this produces the Washington Post wondering, \"Can the Brits swing Ohio?\", and the New York Times reporting, in unusually demotic voice, \"British Two Cents Draws, in Sum, a Two-Word Reply: Butt Out\". Elsewhere, detailing the robust response to our campaign, the Arab News in Saudi Arabia asks gravely: \"Can the 'special' US-UK relationship survive?\". </p> <p>Even before the Springfield News Sun of Clark County splashed our campaign across its front page (the paper's charming crime correspondent was assigned to the story because, \"There was no crime in the county today\"), it was pretty clear that we had touched off something bigger than we had anticipated. In the first 24 hours after we published details of the campaign, more than 4,000 people visited our website to be matched with a Clark County voter. A day later the figure had reached 7,000, and by this Sunday, when the site was attacked by a (presumably politically inspired) hacker, we had sent out the names of more than 14,000 undecided voters. Not all of them will be acquiring foreign penpals; rightwing bloggers have been urging Republicans to sign up themselves, and prevent names falling into the hands of Euroweenie leftists. But extrapolating from the hundreds of people who have gone to the trouble of copying us their letters, it's a good bet that several thousand will. </p> <p>The letters have made rather stirring reading - sensitive, thoughtful and warm, if occasionally prone to propaganda, too. \"I'm a cartographer who specialises in digital mapping,\" began one Welsh correspondent. \"Parts of the US are almost as familiar to me as Wales. It's a small country but it was the ancestral home of 18 out of the 56 delegates who signed your Declaration of Independence.\" Another, from Leicester, wrote: \"Please forgive this intrusion. I am writing to you because I care about America a great deal. Let me tell you why. I lived and worked in the USA for 22 years. My dearest friends are American and some of my best memories are of July 4 parties, Memorial Day picnics, and the Thanksgiving feasts partaken with the welcoming families of friends. I close my eyes and I still see the woods and lakes of Connecticut.\" </p> <p>At first the letters came almost exclusively from Britain but as word spread, our inbox began to look more and more like a UN telephone directory. In one of those bits of casual alliteration to which journalists are prone, I had introduced the project with the suggestion that it would offer a way for \"people from Basildon to Botswana to campaign in the presidential race\". Suddenly, they were. \"My country is a new democracy,\" wrote a South African. \"When we set about building our nation from the ruins of apartheid, we looked long and hard at the lessons the people of the USA have learned from more than 200 years of self-government and democracy.\" From Chile came this: \"As someone who has lived in the United States and loves it dearly, events over the recent years have caused great concern to many of us in the world.\" They kept coming, from Norway, and Germany, and Morocco, and Australia, and Uruguay, and Sweden, and Singapore, and China, and Brazil, and Italy, and, yes, France, too. </p> <p>Then came the backlash. We had expected it, of course. Fox-viewing America was never going to embrace our modest sortie into US politics and we knew full well that any individual voter might take exception to the idea of a foreigner writing to offer some advice on how they should vote - our website explicitly urged participants to \"imagine how you would feel if you received a letter from an American urging you to vote for Tony Blair ... or Michael Howard.\" But you couldn't fail to be a little shocked by the volume and pitch of the invective directed our way. Most of it was coordinated by a handful of resourceful bloggers - the ringleader of whom is fittingly published on a site called \"spleenville\" - and much of it was eye-wateringly unpleasant. \"I hope your earholes turn to arseholes and shit on your shoulders,\" was one, more repeatable example of the scatalogical genre. Another memorable mail asked: </p> <p>\"How secure is your building that contains all you morons??? </p> <p>Do you have enough security?? </p> <p>ARE YOU SURE ??? Are you VERY sure ??\" </p> <p>Interestingly, one of the recurrent themes running through the onslaught was an ardent admiration for Tony Blair from the kind of people who might feel slightly out of place in even the biggest of New Labour big tents. Another was a curious obsession with the state of British dentistry: \"MAY YOU HAVE TO HAVE A TOOTH CAPPED. I UNDERSTAND IT TAKES AT LEAST 18 MONTHS FOR YOUR GREAT MEDICAL SERVICES TO GET AROUND TO YOU.\" At times, it felt as though whole swathes of America had suffered an epidemic of Tourette syndrome. </p> <p>So far, so bad. The email onslaught was pretty unpleasant and inconvenient for the 53 Guardian colleagues whose addresses were targeted by the rightwing spammers - several of us received more than 700 mails - but by and large they were the sort of missives that left you feeling relieved you were not on the same side of the argument (indeed, any argument) as the sender. The same could be said of the news this week that Rush Limbaugh had devoted virtually all of one of his three-hour shows to our Clark County project. But a much smaller number of responses demanded to be taken more seriously. Some of them, a trifle portentously, questioned whether something such as the Clark County project is an appropriate thing for a newspaper to be doing at all. Others, a small but increasing number of Democrats among them, suggested that our campaign could be dangerously counterproductive. Americans don't like being told what to do, the argument went. If a load of foreigners write telling the voters of Clark County to vote Kerry, they are liable to do precisely the opposite. Or, as Sharon Manitta, spokeswoman in Britain for Democrats Abroad, put it with preternatural confidence: \"This will certainly garner more votes for George Bush.\" Yikes. </p> <p>It's not as if we didn't consider the possibility that our project might have precisely the opposite effect to that intended. The feature introducing the project included notes of caution from Manitta's colleague, Rachelle Valladares, and a University of Columbia professor. It's just that we didn't believe it. For one thing, it seemed unlikely that our campaign would ever reach a scale that would have any real impact on the election, one way or another. For another, it seemed spectacularly patronising to suggest that the people of Clark County would be so volatile that they would vote one way simply because an individual several thousand miles away had suggested they do the opposite. </p> <p>Finally, there was the special nature of the Anglo-American relationship. I suppose it might be possible, after that nasty business in the run up to the Gulf war, to imagine a less internationally minded American voter taking umbrage at the very idea of receiving a letter from a Frenchman, but aren't we the staunchest and most longstanding of allies? Surely a letter from a concerned Brit would be received more like a plea from an old friend. (And surely it was important that Americans, who have been reminded repeatedly during this campaign of Tony Blair's legitimising support for George Bush's Iraqi adventure, should know that a majority of the British public did not share their prime minister's analysis of world affairs.) </p> <p>Well, it's true that we may have underestimated the number of people willing to put pen to paper and shell out 47p for an airmail stamp, and it's true, too, that one or two residents of Clark County may get a letter from a cheese-eating surrender monkey, but I would still bet my last \u20ac10 that none of them will make their election decision by reversing whatever our long-distance lobbyists suggest. Consider the first reports of Clark County residents receiving Guardian-inspired letters. \"When Dawn Brink went to her mailbox and found a letter from Germany, she was surprised because she knows no one from there,\" relates the Springfield News Sun. \"When she opened it, she was even more surprised to find someone asking her to vote for Kerry. \"It caught me off guard,\" she said. \"But I'm always open to listening to other points of view.\" And here's James Chapman, who got a letter from a woman in Yorkshire on Saturday: \"She said it was an important election and asked me to vote for Kerry. It was very nicely written.\" Chapman already planned to vote for Kerry so the letter was pushing at an open door. Two other residents were less thrilled by their missives but did not think anyone would vote differently as a result of them. </p> <p>As for the question of whether any newspaper should be attempting to influence a foreign election in the first place, I'm torn between answering, \"Yes,\" and, \"Puleeeeeese\". Yes, because I can't see any qualitative distinction between what newspapers have always done without controversy - attempt to sway the few foreign readers they have with leaders urging them to back one candidate or another - and our Clark County project. Some time in the next 10 days or so, the Guardian will run one urging its American readers - several million of them now, thanks to the long arm of the internet - to back John Kerry. In what way is Operation Clark County any more than an inventive way of empowering individuals to do the same? </p> <p>Puleeeese, because we're in danger of taking all this too seriously. It's always tricky, and usually disingenuous, to suggest when something has been taken very seriously indeed, that actually it was all a bit of a joke. Operation Clark County was not a joke, but neither was it entirely po-faced - it was a lighthearted attempt to make some quite serious points. There were plenty of clues to its intended spirit in the feature which launched it. The cover, among other things, featured a bumper sticker \"Kentish Town for Kerry\" - a gentle joke at our own expense, given the London district's reputation as the heartland of Britain's liberal chattering classes. The introduction to the project itself, meanwhile, began: \"Where others might see delusions of grandeur, we saw an opportunity for public service ...\" </p> <p>Somewhere along the line, though, the good-humoured spirit of the enterprise got lost in translation. It's easier perhaps for British readers to recognise that a project launched in G2 - the same section which sought to save Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith by persuading him to pose in front of a poster which read, \"It rained less under the Conservatives\" - was not to be taken in deadly earnest. Reading some American correspondence, you might believe that the editor of the Guardian himself was secreted in a subterranean war room plotting George Bush's demise. </p> <p>Oddly, it seems that it is the folks in Clark County itself who have best recognised the spirit of the enterprise. Local media coverage has been consistently fair and good humoured. Even the spokesman for Ohio's Bush-Cheney campaign replied to the first query about our effort with a wry reference to the events of 1776: \"The last time the Brits tried to persuade us to do something, we started a revolution.\" Nevertheless it feels as if the time has come to let the good people of the county make their minds up in peace. Since sending a Guardian delegation to the county in the last week of the campaign would be bound to prolong the media brouhaha, with unknowable consequences, and since some of the mail we have received brings to mind the old joke about unenviable holidays (first prize one week, second prize two weeks), we have decided that our competition winners will be watching the last days of the campaign from another, more tranquil, corner of the American electoral battlefield. </p> <p>We set out to get people talking and thinking about the impact of the US election on citizens of other countries, and that is what we have done. For the Guardian to have experienced such a backlash to an editorial project is extraordinary, but the number of complaints are thoroughly outdone by the number of people who engaged positively with the project. What other lessons can we draw from Operation Clark County? I guess we will have to wait till November 3 to find out for sure, but here's a provisional stab: there are a huge number of people around the world who are profoundly dismayed by the prospect of another four years of a Bush White House and who are desperate for a way to do something about it; Guardian readers are a reassuringly engaged, resourceful and largely charming bunch; parts of America have become so isolationist that even the idea of individuals receiving letters from foreigners is enough to give politicians the collywobbles and, perhaps, in the digital age little acorns can turn into big trees very, very quickly. </p> <p>Got to run now - the Finnish local elections are coming up on Sunday.</p>",

When the Sox went 3-0 down to the New York Yankees at the start of the American League championship series, we were frankly worried that Elephant's twin baseball and political aspirations were going the way of his doomed \"Don't attack Iraq\" button.</p> <p>(Note to baseball newcomers: the top two teams in both leagues, the American and the National, play a series of up to seven games to determine which team will play in the final, otherwise known as the World Series. It's kinda like a cricket Test series. Boston's win yesterday in game seven sends them to the world series. Boston has not won the World Series since 1918.)</p> <p>However, in light of the historic Sox comeback, our fluffy Democrat is feeling feisty. Or will be, after a few paracetamol. A Kerry win is assured, he slurred after we prodded him with a stick. (We do apologise to the numerous Democratic Yankee fans, and we know it must hurt, but a button's a button. You'll thank Elephant on November 3.)</p> <p>But not so fast there, Dumbo. Baseball may have yet another metaphor in store for us: tonight the Houston Astros face down the St Louis Cardinals in game seven of the National League championship series. The winner will meet Boston on Saturday for game one of the <a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/index.jsp\">World Series</a>. </p> <p>An Astros win would, of course, mean a Texas v Massachusetts World Series.

  "Welcome to the Wrap, Guardian Unlimited's round-up of the best of the day's papers. <p><b>BULLETS AND BALLOT BOXES</b></p> <p>\"Just say no\", implores the Guardian. But according to the front paper's front page, the sentiment comes too late. Tony Blair has just said yes to the Pentagon's request that 600 British troops be redeployed to a US-controlled area south of Baghdad.</p> <p>\"Ministerial sources will defend the decision on the basis that the request came as much from the Iraqi interim prime minister, Ayad Allawi, as the Americans,\" the paper says. \"They dismissed suggestions\" - aired in the Telegraph - \"that the decision had been made last week ... government sources also argued that Britain could not criticise heavy-handed counter-insurgency tactics by the US and not take on some of the toughest parts of Iraq\".</p> <p>Tony Blair told the Commons yesterday that the Black Watch troops would be \"home by Christmas\". But the Times dampens down that optimism by splashing with the news that an additional 1300 British troops could be called up for duty in Iraq before next January's elections. The suggestion, voiced on the Times' letters page today, that redeploying the Black Watch would enable George Bush to vaunt the strength of the US-led coalition at a very opportune moment is mocked by Gerard Baker. \"Picture the scene in some family room in Volusia County, Florida. They have just read on page B27 of the local paper an Associated Press brief with the news that plucky Geoff Hoon has ordered the British to save America's skin.\"</p> <p>Peter Riddell drives home the point on the same page: \"What anyone overseas says or does is irrelevant to the outcome of the US election.\"</p> <p>Which leads the Wrap to the furore surrounding the Guardian's initiative to encourage readers to write to voters in Clark County, Ohio in an effort to influence their vote.</p> <p>\"Terry Brown had received a letter from a Scottish Guardian reader,\" reports the Telegraph's correspondent from Ohio. \"The navy veteran and retired lorry builder was 'offended' as he read the polite note, from Nicola Smith of West Lothian, with its denunciation of the Iraq war as a 'farce', and closing plea to remove from power 'the parties responsible for this war'.</p> <p>\"Mr Brown looked out at his front garden, decorated with a US flag on a tall pole, a giant carving of an American eagle and a wooden cross marked: 'September 11, 2001'.</p> <p>\"'I feel very strongly that this was an invasion of my privacy,' he said.\"</p> <p>In an article billed on the Guardian's front page as \"Operation Clark County - the exit strategy\", the Guardian's features editor defends the project. \"We set out to get people talking and thinking about the impact of the US election on citizens of other countries, and that is what we have done.\"</p> <p>What news of the election itself?

  "The Royal College of Nursing yesterday put restoration of the school nursing service and a ban on smoking in public places at the top of its list of demands at the next general election. It published a six-point manifesto to put pressure on the political parties to campaign on issues of patient care. <p>The RCN, the leading professional union for nursing, calls for a dramatic increase in the number of school nurses to give all children access to treatment and advice. \"At present there are less than 3,000 school nurses across the UK, serving almost 26,000 primary and secondary schools,\" it said. </p> <p>Thousands of lives and millions of NHS pounds would be saved by banning smoking in all enclosed public places, including workplaces, bars and restaurants, it added. </p> <p>Other demands in the RCN manifesto were legislation to ensure that all those committing acts of violence against healthcare staff are prosecuted; fully funded long-term nursing care in all parts of the UK; recruitment and retention of nurses being made a priority; and a nurse on every strategic board in the health service. </p> <p>Sylvia Denton, the RCN president, said: \"Healthcare is too important to leave to politicians because it is nurses who are the most powerful advocates for patients. It's time to harness that power ... the RCN challenges every political party seeking election to listen to nurses.\"</p>",
  "Local councils will increasingly lose their role in providing services to schools and should not seek to claw back powers allowing them to tell headteachers what to do, Charles Clarke, the education secretary, said yesterday. <p>Mr Clarke told education authority and social service chiefs that he wanted a \"new relationship\" with councils, and that those who predicted the death of local government were wrong. </p> <p>But he made clear the government would hold fast to its decision to reform the role of councils, making them into \"leaders, brokers, commissioners and enablers\", pursuing better services rather than running services directly. </p> <p>Delegates at the Local Government Association conference in Gateshead were persuaded that they would retain a key role. </p> <p>Tony Hunter, the incoming president of the Association of Directors of Social Services, said: \"He referred to our leadership role. Most councils recognise that as a role they want to adopt.\" </p> <p>But some council chiefs remained uneasy at changes some believed could effectively neuter their powers, particularly in education. </p> <p>A survey of chief education officers published during the conference found that most believed moves to set school budgets almost entirely from Whitehall would leave authorities with little flexibility for responding to local needs. </p> <p>A new education bill, to be included in the Queen's speech and expected to be on the statute book before the general election, will guarantee schools three-year funding, leaving councils effectively as bankers with little discretion over where the money goes. </p> <p>The government's five-year plan for education, published in the summer, outlined moves to encourage secondary schools to become foundation schools and gain more autonomy, including over spending. </p> <p>Alison King, chair of the Local Government Association's children and young people board, said schools were the linchpin of local communities, and government plans to give them more autonomy had not to be at the expense of vital links with other services. </p> <p>Mr Clarke told delegates yesterday: \"Your role will ... be increasingly about commissioning and working with and through others.\" He added: \"Those who predict the death of local government are wrong ... we need you as leaders, brokers, commissioners and enablers, advocates and innovators in the delivery of services for children, young people, parents and families.\" </p> <p>He said the \"historical stand-off\" between local government and Whitehall had to end but warned: \"Let me be honest again and say that seeking extra powers to require other people to do things - in particular frontline providers like schools - is simply a blind alley.\" </p> <p>He made no concession to local government leaders who complained that they could not integrate education and children's social services unless schools were obliged to cooperate. Integration was a key recommendation of the inquiry into the death of the child abuse victim Victoria Climbi\u00e9. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the \"aggregated\" results of GCSE exams taken this summer will be published today, with the national improvement in the proportion of youngsters getting five or more subjects at good grades. Today's results will also show how teenagers have performed in a wider range of vocational qualifications. </p> <p>The school standards minister, David Miliband, said: \"We defend the rise in achievement as the result of improved quality of teaching More does not mean worse. What is less well-known are the figures on rising achievement in our toughest areas. </p> <p>\"If we had promised 10 years ago to raise achievement three or four times the national average in our toughest urban areas people would have scoffed. Yet it is happening today.\"</p>",
  "<p>Every so often a programme comes along that makes watching television not only a duty but a pleasure. We're lucky at the moment: there are two. Green Wing continues on Channel 4 on Fridays, and now the BBC has entirely redeemed itself for any shortcomings real or imagined with <strong>The Power of Nightmares</strong> (BBC2). </p> <p>The first part of Adam Curtis's trilogy of films about global politics was many things. Primarily, it was a forensic examination of how two apparently conflicting ideologies - American neo-conservatism and Islamic fundamentalism - came to rule the modern world. Second, it was a timely blast in the face of political waffle and half-truths, that should be required viewing for anyone allowed to vote in a democracy. Third - and this was by no means the least of its achievements - it solved the age-old problem of documentary film-makers who don't have a lot of original footage to show. Curtis's deployment of archive material was so witty and pertinent that it told the story as much as the words. </p> <p>Curtis focused on two key figures in postwar political philosophy - Egyptian Sayyid Qutb and American Leo Strauss - whose ideas were so similar that you could hardly see the join. Both found Truman's America to be some kind of immoral hell on earth. Both thought personal freedom was the road to perdition. Both their philosophies led, by a maze-like route that Curtis rendered clear, to an unreasoning hatred of the USSR. And when the USSR was out of the way - can you see what comes next? </p> <p>They turned on each other. </p> <p>There's no point in regurgitating Curtis's arguments, not that I'm equal to the job, but there were some highlights worth recalling. Donald Rumsfeld featured as a key player in the Ford administration, banging on about the Red Peril as early as 1975. When the CIA said there was no evidence for weapons of mass destruction, he commissioned a report that used that very lack of evidence as proof of their existence. At the same time, Qutb's disciple Ayman Zawahiri was figuring out that mass murder of \"non-Muslims\" (ie everyone apart from his gang) was justifiable. Rumsfeld went on to we-all-know-what. Zawahiri went on to inspire Osama bin Laden. As this tale unfolded with grisly logic, Curtis bombarded us with sights and sounds that had a logic of their own. He raided archives well - there was some lovely footage of clean-cut American youth at a 50s dance, an image that, to Qutb, proved the hopeless decadence of the west. But it was when Curtis got playful that his cinematic skills really took the breath away. At the end of the film, we saw Taliban fighters dancing to that same schmaltzy 50s groove; never has a complex point about the cyclical nature of history been so deftly made. </p> <p>It's beyond the power of a review column to do more than hint at the richness of The Power of Nightmares, but worth mentioning that the series continues next week and can only get better as it moves closer to the current situation. Documentary of the year, without a shadow of a doubt. </p> <p>Meanwhile, in the parallel universe that is Sun Hill nick, law-enforcement professionals were spending more time beating up, terrorising and murdering each other than they were in policing this crime-torn quarter of London. At one point Gabriel (Todd Carty) practically throttled June (Trudie Goodwin) against a brick wall - then she calmly got into the car with him to go and sort out a bag-snatching. </p> <p>Back at the station, everyone else was prowling around in a state of nervous exhaustion, sexual arousal or both. I bet they don't prepare you for that at Hendon. It was all getting so tense that when Kerry (Beth Cordingly) got murdered it came as a relief, like a thunderstorm on a sultry day. I love <strong>The Bill</strong> (ITV1) when it lurches into Grand Guignol, and it don't get much grander than this. </p> <p>It's always a relief to see Liza Minnelli alive and working, and she was actually quite funny in a cameo in <strong>Arrested Development</strong>, the hit American show that BBC2 managed to wrest from the competition. She played Lucille Austero, described by a myopic admirer as \"a brownish area with points\", which isn't a bad summation of Minnelli's basic look. Cunningly, the character had to fall over a lot; whether this was an in-joke, or just sound logistical planning, is not for us to say.</p>",

  "In a campaign in which George Bush and John Kerry have shown little compunction for indulging in insults and barbs, it was perhaps inevitable that their wives would be drawn into the fray. <p>Teresa Heinz Kerry drew first blood yesterday, telling an interviewer that Laura Bush had never held \"a real job\", seemingly overlooking the fact that she worked for a decade as a librarian and schoolteacher in the 1970s. </p> <p>Ms Heinz Kerry apologised almost immediately but the gaffe drew expressions of outrage from Republican spin masters who accused the wife of the Democratic challenger of disrespecting America's mothers and homemakers. </p> <p>The would-be first lady had been trying to explain to the USA Today newspaper that she would make a rather different first lady from the demure and retiring Ms Bush. </p> <p>As mistress of the White House, Mrs Bush is viewed as an even more traditional First Lady than her mother-in-law, Barbara Bush. Until the election season got under way - and Mrs Bush proved to be a vote getter - she was rarely visible. Her personal mission as First Lady to promote reading was determinedly low key. </p> <p>Ms Heinz Kerry, in contrast, has said she is determined to carry on with her life's work if she moves to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, managing the philanthropic trusts of the Heinz Foundation . </p> <p>But Ms Heinz Kerry's talent for talking herself into trouble often distracts from her more serious concerns about healthcare and the environment. Earlier this year, she was pilloried for telling a rightwing commentator to shove it, and for telling a heckler at a rally that Mr Bush's re-election would lead to \"four more years of hell\". </p> <p>Yesterday's comments about Mrs Bush's career resum\u00e9 had the same effect. </p> <p>\"Well, you know, I don't know Laura Bush,\" Ms Heinz Kerry told USA Today. \"She seems to be calm, and she has a sparkle in her eye, which is good. But I don't know that she's ever had a real job - I mean, since she's been grown up.\" </p> <p>Ms Heinz Kerry apologised hours later, noting that Ms Bush had indeed worked as a librarian and schoolteacher before marrying at the age of 30 and having twin daughters. </p> <p>Ms Heinz Kerry's spell in the workforce was also brief. After marriage to her first husband, John Heinz, she gave up work as a translator and focused on bringing up their three sons. </p> <p>But Ms Heinz Kerry's apology was not swift enough for Karen Hughes, one of Mr Bush's closest advisers. </p> <p>\"Being a librarian is a real job. Being a teacher is a real job,\" Ms Hughes told CNN television. \"These comments are an unfortunate way of trying to drive a wedge between women who choose to work at home and women who work outside the home.\"</p>",
  "Passing almost without notice earlier this month, the public release of The Civil Rights Record of the George W Bush Administration - the official staff report prepared by the US Civil Rights Commission - whose submission is required by federal law, was blocked by the Republican commissioners. None the less, it was posted on the commission's website: \"This report finds that President Bush has neither exhibited leadership on pressing civil rights issues, nor taken actions that matched his words.\" <p>Bush has held the Civil Rights Commission in contempt since its June 2001 report on Election Practices in Florida During the 2000 Campaign. Then it concluded: \"The commission's findings make one thing clear: widespread voter disenfranchisement - not the dead-heat contest - was the extraordinary feature in the Florida election ... The disenfranchisement of Florida's voters fell most harshly on the shoulders of black voters.\" </p> <p>Vast efforts to mobilise or suppress African-American, Hispanic and Democratic voters have already reached a greater level of intensity than in any modern campaign. The Republicans in Ohio, for example, have attempted to toss out new Democratregistrations because it was claimed they were written on the wrong weight of paper, a gambit overruled by a federal court. From Pennsylvania to Arizona, a Republican consulting firm is discouraging new Democratic voters from getting on the rolls. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the Democratic party has more than 10,000 lawyers deployed to defend against voter suppression, 2,000 stationed in Florida; civil rights groups are sending out more than 6,000 lawyers. Bush v Gore remains an open wound; and now the battle over voting rights, over democracy itself, is being fought again. </p> <p>Since 2002, when Republicans exploited terrorism to besmirch the patriotism of Democrats in the midterm elections, what can only be called a new Democratic party has been summoned into existence by extra-party groups. More than 100,000 activists are tramping through the precincts. In Ohio alone, more than 300,000 new Democratic voters have been added, Cecile Richards, director of America Votes, told me. These registrations of literally millions of new voters did not just happen; they were organised. </p> <p>The polls, nearly all showing a dead-even race, fail to account for the new voters, who have no past records. They do not measure those for whom a mobile is their main phone - 6% of the population - who will vote Democrat by a margin of two-and-a-half to one. </p> <p>The Democracy Corps poll, however, filters in newly registered voters. Four months ago, the newly registered made up only 1% of the sample. One month ago, they comprised 4%. Now they are at 7% and rising. And they will vote for Kerry over Bush by 61% to 37%. </p> <p>Bush's job approval has fallen now to 47 in this poll; presidents below 50 always lose. Bush has not campaigned in Ohio for three weeks, though he plans to stop there this week. Unemployment continues to rise in the state. \"There is no other explanation for his absence,\" says Stanley Greenberg, Bill Clinton's 1992 campaign pollster, \"other than his numbers go down when he's there. His position on jobs is implausible.\" </p> <p>Democracy Corps research shows that best-case arguments for either candidate shift no voters. The deciding factor will be turnout: the higher the turnout the larger the vote for Democrats. </p> <p>Since September 11 infused Bush with a mission, he has evoked hovering angels, crusades, mushroom clouds, evildoers, shades of a universe of death. His imagery induces a dynamic of paralysis before the threat and fervour in embrace of his absolute reassurance and power. Dread without end requires faith without limit. </p> <p>Yet Bush found himself on the defensive when the New York Times reported on the closed gathering of his campaign contributors, where he revealed his radical programme for his second term - rightwing capture of the supreme court, privatising social security, turning over national land to the oil companies, more tax cuts. Kerry was prompted to raise these issues. And Bush whined that Kerry was practising \"the politics of fear\". The next day Dick Cheney projected terrorists exploding nuclear weapons within the US, and offered Bush as saviour from looming apocalypse. </p> <p>\"No passion so effectually robs the mind of all its powers of acting and reasoning as terror,\" wrote Edmund Burke. But not even the eve of destruction will stifle turnout. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Sidney Blumenthal, a former senior adviser to President Clinton, is Washington bureau chief of <a href=\"http://www.salon.com\">salon.com</a> </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:sidney_blumenthal @yahoo.com\">sidney_blumenthal@yahoo.com</a></p>",
  "It took a good hour of trudging through the autumn leaves to the side doors of people's homes, poring over voter lists and sheaves of pamphlets, and looking out nervously for dogs, before Grace Brookins struck gold. <p>Robbie Phillips, 68, a retired factory worker - and fellow union member according to Ms Brookins's list - was at home, was willing to answer the door to a stranger, and was inclined to vote for John Kerry.</p> <p>\"I want what's-his-name,\" Ms Phillips says, tapping her forehead before her son supplies the name of the Democratic challenger.</p> <p>\"He's from poor people, and I'm poor. I don't want Bush to get in, because he hasn't done anything for us.\"</p> <p>Her son, George Phillips, delivers even better news for Ms Brookins, a nurse's assistant now working to help the Service Employees International Union get out the Democratic vote. At 43, Mr Phillips has never before felt moved to vote.</p> <p>\"I just never felt it was required,\" he says. \"But every time I went to the grocery store, people kept asking me and asking me, 'Are you registered?', and one time I finally stopped.\"</p> <p>Ms Brookins hands out pamphlets about healthcare (Ms Phillips is ill) and instructions for polling day, and heads for the next door.</p> <p>With Mr Kerry and George Bush at a dead heat, political operatives call the campaign a \"ground war for voters\", and Ms Brookins is one of the thousands of footsoldiers deployed by the parties to get supporters out on polling day.</p> <p>There is also a host of allied organisations at work. The Democrats have the union umbrella group the AFL-CIO, and America Coming Together, the voter registration effort funded by the billionaire George Soros. The Republicans have the chamber of commerce and other business organisations.</p> <p>Political scientists predict a sharp rise in voter participation across the US, bumping up the 2000 turnout of 54% towards 60%.</p> <p>A good chunk of those new voters will come from Ohio, the most fiercely contested state. Electoral officials in Ohio say they have recorded half a million new voters since March. Across the state, the Republicans claim some 200,000 while a coalition of Democratic allies, union organisations and church groups claim to have turned in 300,000 voting cards.</p> <p>More than 120,000 of the new Ohio registrations are from Cuyahoga county, surrounding Cleveland, and many of them are like the Phillipses: poor and African-American, and generally less likely than the average voter to turn out on polling day.</p> <p>Over the past year voter registration drives have reached deep into the areas of under-privilege, signing up ex-convicts, residents of subsidised and public housing projects, young people, single mothers and thousands of shut-in senior citizens.</p> <p>They discovered people who had never voted. \"Either they didn't feel it was important to them, or they were poor and didn't feel it touched their lives, or they were young and they hadn't been educated about their rights,\" says Judy Gallo, the co-chair of the Greater Cleveland voter registration coalition.</p> <p>Although the coalition is officially non-partisan, the newcomers can reliably be counted on to vote Democratic. Their votes could make all the difference in Ohio, where Al Gore lost by just four percentage points.</p> <p>\"This is light years of difference away from 2000,\" says Stephanie Tubbs Jones, a Democratic congresswoman from Ohio and the national co-chair of the Kerry campaign. \"What is really going to kick their butt is the new registrations.\"</p> <p>That is, if the new recruits make it to the polls. Election officials say about 30% of the new registrations are simple changes of address. Others are fake - like the registration forms in Defiance County trying to add Mary Poppins and 100 other fictional characters to the voting rolls.</p> <p>Like Mr Phillips, some of the newcomers may have been badgered into signing up to vote, and may lose interest by polling day. Others may be turned away on a technicality.</p> <p>But, despite all the caveats, Ohioans expect a high turnout. In past elections, political organisers say they could count on about 40% of newly registered voters actually casting their ballot. This year they are aiming for 65%, says Arnold Pinkney, the Cleveland director of America Coming Together.</p> <p>Mr Pinkney has worked on every election since Jimmy Carter in 1976, and he says he has never detected such enthusiasm. From now until the election, volunteers and paid workers aim to contact every registered voter at least three times to make sure they turn up on the day.</p> <p>\"I am going to drag them there if I have to,\" says Meryl Johnson, a vice-president of the Cleveland Teachers' Union.</p> <p>For the past few months she has spent three hours a day on top of her job, writing letters or making phone calls urging people to vote. She has even set homework for her eighth-grade English class on the importance of voting in the hope it might rub off on their parents.</p> <p>\"The most exciting thing for me is, when Kerry wins it is going to make believers out of a whole lot of poor people,\" she says.</p> <p>\"They are going to know that their vote does matter.\"</p>",
  "Bill Clinton, once known on the campaign trail as Elvis for his superstar, crowd-pleasing charms, will rise from his sick bed next week to come to John Kerry's aid, six weeks after a quadruple bypass operation. <p>Mr Clinton's last-ditch intervention, starting on Monday in Philadelphia in a joint appearance with Mr Kerry, comes in the face of resistance from his wife. Senator Hillary Clinton is concerned that the former president could endanger his health so soon after the operation. </p> <p>\"Hillary has been fighting this all along, but we'll get a few appearances,\" said a senior Democratic official who was involved in the negotiations over Mr Clinton's participation. \"He really wants to do this. He watches every detail of the race. He knows more about it than I do.\" </p> <p>The charisma of the 58-year-old former president has made him a figure of adulation among the Democratic faithful, but his participation may be a double-edged sword. </p> <p>He also galvanises Conservatives, who hold him in contempt for the Monica Lewinsky scandal. For that reason, Al Gore did not call on his help four years ago - a decision much criticised by Democratic activists. </p> <p>A Kerry spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said Mr Clinton, who has been convalescing at his home in Chappaqua, New York, will make several solo campaign stops next week, after his joint appearance with Mr Kerry. </p> <p>Mr Clinton's office in Harlem yesterday issued a short statement saying he was \"pleased to be able to help John Kerry in this very important campaign for the future of our country\". </p> <p>Mr Clinton has also agreed to tape a message to be sent out to voters' home telephones, and he may also record a radio advertisement. </p> <p>At a Tuesday night campaign event, Mr Kerry said he had spoken by phone to Mr Clinton, who had encouraged him, saying White House \"scare tactics\" would backfire. </p> <p>The White House is countering Mr Clinton's imminent return by taking the unusual step of sending the president's national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, out on the campaign trail. </p> <p>It is an unprecedented step, since national security advisers do not normally take part in campaign politics, but the White House spokesman, Scott McClellan, yesterday defended the decision, saying Ms Rice had been invited to speak at a number of venues. </p> <p>Mr Clinton's reappearance on the political scene comes at a time when Mr Kerry is running neck-and-neck with the president in some polls and trailing in others. </p> <p>A tracking poll by the Washington Post and ABC television put George Bush five percentage points ahead, but it offered a spark of hope to Mr Kerry. He is winning by 54% to 43% among first-time voters, which suggests a high turnout on November 2 will be in his favour. </p> <p>The two rivals pressed on with their high-mileage campaigning yesterday, sniping at each other as they criss-crossed the midwest in search of crucial swing votes. </p> <p>\"The president says he's a leader. Well, Mr President, look behind you, there's hardly anyone there,\" Mr Kerry said, pointing out considerable allied opposition to the war. \"It's not leadership if we haven't built the strongest alliance possible and if America is going almost alone.\" Mr Bush hit back, saying his challenger was guilty of a \"fundamental misunderstanding\" of the so-called war on terror. </p> <p>In a contest increasingly influenced by religion, America's attorney general, John Ashcroft, claimed divine intervention in helping to keep the country safe from terrorist attack since 2001. </p> <p>\"For three years our nation has been blessed,\" Mr Ashcroft told the US chamber of commerce in Washington. \"But the hand of providence has been assisted by the dedicated men and women of the department of justice. In three years, we have compiled a record of achievement that is impressive by peacetime standards.\"</p>"
