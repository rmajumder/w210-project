  "On the eve of the election here in the US, our country's reputation is in a precarious position. Our citizens have succumbed to fear. <p>Fear of an exaggerated external threat that was created in part by our own foreign policy; fear of economic hardship, fuelled by reckless government expenditures; and fear of introspection, lest we admit what we have done to much of the world. </p> <p>But we also have hope: that we can be worthy of the occasional admiration we have enjoyed in the past. I pray that I represent more than half of the population - those who have the courage to bring about our own regime change. But, God forbid, should that not happen, remember that not all Americans are represented by all that you might resent or despise. Most of us have integrity, honesty and compassion. We just don't happen to hold the offices that let you see it.<br><b>Gunther Rainhold</b><br>Portland, Oregon </p> <p>Why is everyone so determined in the UK to imagine the worst: a Bush victory tomorrow. Is this so that the sense of relief is greater? The optimists this side of the pond are pointing out that young people and normally non-voting Americans will be turning out in droves, and the pollsters have no access to these Democrat supporters, so we don't hear about them on Fox news. While the pessimists and panickers are producing the most magnificent political satire, cartoons and tracts, a veritable army of lawyers is preparing to sue Jeb Bush and his ilk, in the case of repetitive theft syndrome; even the most biased reports suggest that the race is close.<br><b>Tania Edwards</b><br>Brooklyn, New York </p> <p>I was just watching ABC television on your Clark County letter-writing campaign and all the negative response it has brought.

  "Five Tutsi political parties dropped their opposition to Burundi's draft constitution yesterday, easing the way for the election of a new government that could help end years of ethnic violence. <p>The constitution will set up a new power-sharing arrangement between the majority Hutus and minority Tutsis. It is due to go to a referendum by November 26. </p> <p>But six Tutsi parties continue to complain that the draft placed too much power in the hands of the Hutus and boycotted Burundi's parliament when it met on October 20 to endorse it. </p> <p>\"We have taken this decision to give peace a chance,\" said Joseph Nzeyimana, the leader of the Democratic Rally for Economic and Social Development party. </p> <p>He said the five parties would try to amend certain sections of the draft they consider to be unfair to the Tutsis in parliament before the referendum. He added: \"We will accept the constitution to enable the president of the republic to bring it to a popular debate. </p> <p>\"If the public agrees with our views, we recommend this to be taken as amendments in the constitution before it is taken to a referendum.\" </p> <p>The government hopes the new constitution will help to end fighting between the politically dominant Tutsis and Hutus that has killed 300,000 people in the last decade. </p> <p>The draft also extends the life of President Domitien Ndayizeye's transitional government until elections take place in the first half of 2005. </p> <p>Analysts said the move was a boost for peace, but added that any solution to the standoff would depend on the main Tutsi party, Uprona, which led the opposition to the interim constitution. It has yet to change its position. </p> <p>The Tutsi parties want the presidency to be rotated every five years between a Tutsi and a Hutu, with the president and his deputy \"co-managing\" the country. </p> <p>But the government says it cannot support a constitution which favours one political group above another. <br><b>Reuters</b></p>",
  "I live in Washington, DC now, after nearly 30 years of living in New York City. Washington is built on swampland, literally, an origin that signals its character. It was designed to look like Paris. There are boulevards, monuments, museums, along with a dangerous, desolate, and impoverished inner city, still not rebuilt from the 1968 riots triggered by the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. Citizens of Washington, DC do not have any voting representatives in Congress. There was and is no state entity as such. Washington is a district, not quite a city, sleepy and southern in its habits, not fully enfranchised. We are not so much citizens as members of a colony, like Guam or Puerto Rico. <p>Yet this is a swamp devoted to politics. The players in this company town live on political barter, while amassing personal fortunes for themselves. I am not a player. I experience instead an adumbrated form of democracy, articulated most eloquently by the invitation every four years to vote for a president and vice-president. </p> <p>I accept the vote as a primitive expression of democracy out of respect for my suffragist foremothers. They fought so hard for women's civil and economic equality and ended up settling for the vote. I measure this up against a rape or an honour killing and I don't think it counts for much. </p> <p>Anyway, I am supposed to vote for one or the other of two men who are differentiated by style, not by policies. They have more in common with each other than either has with me. They also both lie. </p> <p>I'm voting for John Kerry, and I'm not happy. In 1972, during the Vietnam war, I refused to vote for anti-war candidate George McGovern, even though I had spent most of my young adult life in opposition to the war, because he was anti-abortion. I refused to vote for \u00fcber-liberal, pro-civil rights, all-around good guy Hubert Humphrey because he did nothing while demonstrators were being beaten up by police in Chicago at the 1968 Democratic Convention. In 1976, while my feminist colleagues organised for Jimmy Carter, I refused to sign petitions or vote for him because he was anti-abortion. The first thing Carter did when elected was to have his health secretary end all federally funded abortions, which was the only access poor women had. (Yes, my sisters learned something. Now the legality of abortion, not access, is the feminist litmus test - too little, too late). </p> <p>In 1984, I couldn't bear Geraldine Ferraro as the first woman vice-presidential candidate because her husband, John Zaccaro, owned a warehouse filled with pornography. The Washington Post reported that year that Zaccaro refused to comply with requests for full income and tax disclosures. I voted the first time (in 1992) for Bill Clinton because, on a lecture tour in Texas, I heard George HW Bush - known fondly in retrospect as 41 (George W being 43) - accuse Clinton of un-American activities, which he inferred from a trip Clinton had made to Moscow when he was at Oxford as a student. In 2000, I voted for Ralph Nader. I don't recommend myself as a model for citizenship, except to say that I have always abhorred the lesser-of-two-evils philosophy, and Al Gore let himself be dressed by Naomi Wolf. </p> <p>I couldn't be bothered to vote most of the time because it was almost always a choice between the corrupt and the more corrupt. There is the primordial sludge and then the more pristine amoeba. My guy's the amoeba; the other guy's the sludge. This is a recipe for madness, otherwise known as the American president. </p> <p>Of course, who could have imagined September 11, 2001, and Bush, the war president? And if one were to strike out against state sponsors of terrorism, who could imagine mistaking Iraq for Iran, even though in English they appear nearly the same? This is a George W kind of error. </p> <p>Let me tell you about my amoeba, Kerry. He voted for the Iraq war. Asked if he, knowing then what he knows now (no weapons of mass destruction, no nuclear arsenal), would have voted differently, he said no. He is vaguely committed to putting more soldiers on the ground. He showed up for his political convention as a Vietnam war combatant, not as an anti-war protester, which he was, with honour. He is a multi-millionaire married to a multi-billionaire. His running mate, John Edwards, is more pro-war than he is, less ambivalent and less ambiguous. Edwards is also a multi-millionaire. </p> <p>My amoeba talks about the middle-class; he has conveniently forgotten about the poor. (Edwards used to talk about poverty before he was absorbed into Kerry's attempted seduction of the middle class.) </p> <p>My amoeba calls prostitution a \"nuisance\" instead of a crime against women. Some 25 years ago my amoeba was a prosecutor. He prosecuted at least one rape case, which he won. He was responsible for setting up counselling for rape victims. This was precocious and superb. </p> <p>Fast forward: two weeks before the election, my amoeba recognised that American women make 76 cents against every male dollar and decided to draw attention to this fact. Such is the gratitude of women that my amoeba beats the primordial sludge by as much as 10 percentage points among women in the subsequent polls. He is especially popular with single women who, needless to say, have to support themselves. </p> <p>My amoeba promises improvement. He will support pay-equity legislation. (Have I been in a deep sleep? Is this 1970?) In the parlance of his campaign, he has a plan. He keeps the specifics to himself. He will also raise the minimum wage over several years from $5.15 an hour to $7 an hour which, his campaign reckons, will give 9.2 million women another $3,800 a year. How pathetic is that? He has a plan for health insurance and another plan to produce jobs and a plan to protect social security, that tiny safety net that older Americans, especially women, have against utter poverty. In any other year, this wouldn't be enough to differentiate him from the primordial sludge, because mostly it is not true. It's either the Iraq war or health care, not both. </p> <p>Now look at what George W offers me. First, he gives me his middle initial: \"W is for Women\". I don't want his initial inscribed on me. I find the idea repugnant. He does not recognise the pay differential between men and women. On the other hand, he is against sex trafficking and has said so when addressing the UN. He has strong evangelical support for this position. He is for bringing equality to women in the Arab and Islamic world. I may want it and work for it in the US, but he and his most anti-feminist rightwing advisors, including David Frum and Richard Perle, want women's liberation in the Gulf region, and I do not mean the Gulf of Mexico. Anywhere but here seems to be the general plan. </p> <p>And what is the price for these women's rights? It's a small one. Many bombs must fall and many innocents must die. </p> <p>The Bush/Cheney argument for reelection comes down to this: in Iraq we have created a new site for terrorists and they are so busy there that they won't come here. Vote for us and you'll be safe. Vote for Kerry/Edwards and you'll likely die. One has a choice between massacres there or here. Vote Bush/Cheney. Choose there. </p> <p>Despite the American disdain for irony, electoral politics in the US is nothing if not a lesson in irony. Richard Nixon the anti-communist went to China and ended the Vietnam war. Clinton, prince of Democratic post-liberals, joined with Republicans - in fact, led them - to get African-American single mothers kicked off welfare and to create political cover for those politicians abandoning the poor. He then had the honour of being proclaimed, by Toni Morrison no less, the first black president. And, in this land of political hallucination, maybe he was. He also may be the only black president. </p> <p>What Kerry will do is this: he will get European and even Arab allies to pony up in Iraq; he will intensify the war there; he will bring in more troops. This policy will make it impossible for the Democratic candidate who follows him, or he himself if he runs again, to have anything but a pro-war policy. A rightwing Republican, maybe even a woman, plain-spoken and Reaganesque (or Thatcheresque), will triumph by promising an end to the Iraq war either four or eight years from now. He or she will deliver because the war will be over and the US and its many allies will have lost. This will be another generation's Vietnam with the blame having a certain global quality. As at his convention, Kerry the combatant will have trumped Kerry the anti-war protester. </p> <p>So why is it that I'm voting for Kerry? Oh, right, it's because my Massachusetts amoeba is better than Texas primordial sludge. Make no mistake: I have regional emotions. When someone from Massachusetts, the centre of abolitionist activism, and someone from Texas, in our day and age a symbol of the Confederacy, mix it up, our civil war is being refought. Kerry represents those brilliant abolitionists - and he does it badly. Shame on him. </p> <p>The thing is that I'm scared to death that Bush will win. If Bush wins, we get more terror, charmingly diverted to countries not the United States. I call that a plan. I admire its simplicity. Who said that boy is stupid? Oh, I did, a few paragraphs up: the whole Iraq/Iran confusion. Of course, being dyslexic is not the same as being stupid. </p> <p>The Bush/Cheney plan is the equivalent of a moral sewer. I don't want to roll in that dirt. It's someone else's blood and it doesn't wash off (cf the Scottish play). </p> <p>We dream, some of us, of being able to be good in a better world. The morally reprehensible - the Bush/ Cheney strategy - smacks us between the eyes; and then, and only then, do we vote for the lesser of two evils. But don't forget that they are two evils. Sick to my stomach because he will stay in Iraq, I'm voting for John Kerry. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Andrea Dworkin's most recent book is Heartbreak: The Political Memoir of a Feminist Militant.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Dead Ringers US Election Special</strong><br> 9pm, BBC2<br> The impressions format returns for a new eight-part series kicking off with this predictably derisory take on US electioneering. As well as Bush and Kerry, there are convincing impressions of Dick Cheney and Michael Moore. And while, as always, there are sketches which fail to raise even a smirk, there are just enough inspired moments to keep you watching. Nice touches include a skit on Fox News - \"Keeping America scared since 1996\" and \"Cheney\" announcing the creation of a new colour - Magurndy - \"because the terrorist threat to America is so great that there aren't enough colours for all the necessary levels of alert\". </p> <p><strong>Britain's Youngest Mums and Dads</strong><br> 9pm, ITV1 <br> The production team was editing right up to the wire on this documentary, hence no preview tapes. But judging by the press release, it could be well worth a look. The film centres on the prevalence of teenage parents in the UK and examines how young people barely out of childhood themselves cope with the responsibilities of raising children of their own. Over 100,000 teenagers a year become pregnant in the UK and here the cameras follow parents such as 17-year-old Anita, who was just 12 when she gave birth to son Cameron. \"I wouldn't change anything about my life,\" says Anita. \"Cameron's the best thing that ever happened to me. [But] someone has pushed the clock forward on my life a bit too much... and it's still a big, big shock.\" </p> <p><strong>The Sopranos</strong><br> 11.30pm, Channel 4<br> In the penultimate episode of the series, the FBI put increasing pressure on Adriana after they learn that she helped to cover up a murder at the Crazy Horse. Elsewhere, matters are coming to a head between Tony and Johnny Sack over the former's reluctance to give up his cousin Tony Blundetto for execution. \"You either deliver that prick to my door,\" warns Sack, \"or I will rain a shit storm down on your family the like of which you have never seen.\"</p>",
  "They have called it the \"Armageddon election\". \"Each side predicts the end is near if the other side wins,\" says pollster John Zogby. But, assuming that the vote is free and fair and a clear winner emerges, the US should wake up on Wednesday with a legitimate president. But these look increasingly like fanciful assumptions. Even if the vote is legitimate, it is likely to be excruciatingly close. Of the seven polls released in Florida on Saturday, four put President George Bush ahead, while three had his Democratic challenger, John Kerry, leading. All were within the margin of error. <p>The fact that the vote has already proved to be anything but free and fair means that Wednesday could look less like the end of Armageddon and more like the beginning of purgatory. Lawyers are accumulating in almost as great a number as the tales of voter suppression, intimidation and obstruction. In Florida's heavily Democratic Broward county, 60,000 absentee ballots have gone missing. In Georgia's Atkinson county, 78% of the registered Hispanic voters were summoned to the county courthouse on Thursday to defend their right to vote after allegations that they were not US citizens. The Board of Registrars there dismissed the complaint. \"The challenges ... are legally insufficient because they are based solely on race,\" said the county attorney, Russ Gillis. \"Those of you who are here because you were challenged, go to the polls Tuesday and vote.\" </p> <p>But the message had already been sent. Tomorrow polling booths will not be the place where the partisan conflicts of this polarised nation will be settled but, in all likelihood, where they will escalate before heading to the courts. The results may be within the margin of error, but the outcome could well be determined by the margin of litigation. </p> <p>The fact that a country wealthy enough to regularly send people into space should have such trouble sending someone to the White House every four years with a modicum of democratic legitimacy is pitiful. But the problems are more political than logistical. The Republicans want to stop as many people voting as they possibly can. On Tuesday they will be sending supporters to the polls and courts to challenge those they say are improperly registered. Democrats are keen to see as many people vote as possible, and are sending supporters to the polls to ensure that no legitimate voter is turned away. This is not because of the Democrats' love of the democratic process - although on balance they have proved themselves far more wedded to the spirit and letter of it than the Republicans. But because the higher the turnout, the greater the likelihood that Kerry will emerge the victor. </p> <p>With just 24 hours to go there is nobody left for Kerry to woo. At this stage, his victory or defeat will hinge on whom his machine can get to the polls and whether their votes will count when they get there. To understand why this is more crucial for Kerry than for Bush, it helps to understand the election as a three-phase process: registration, mobilisation and verification. </p> <p>The Democrats have already won the first round. Thanks to everyone from P Diddy to Michael Moore, this year has seen an unprecedented number of new voters registered, which could produce the highest turnout of those eligible in more than 40 years. In Ohio, where the Republicans won by just 165,019 votes in 2000, there are 700,000 new voters on the rolls. More than 60% of those are believed to be Democrats. In Florida, which Democrats lost by just 537 votes in 2000, more than a million have been added since February, with Democrats boasting almost 45,000 more than Republicans. Many of these are first time voters; a huge portion are young, black and/or poor. Kerry has a sizeable advantage among each of these groups. In the past, they have also been the groups least likely to vote. But this year, thanks to issues like the war, the draft and the supreme court, they claim to be particularly stirred. Almost three-quarters of college students say they will definitely vote this year. </p> <p>This is partly why the polls have been so erratic. Most measure \"likely voters\", which excludes most first timers; and none polls people who only use cellphones, excluding large numbers of young people. The bottom line is that this huge new batch of voters is a wild card. This is not because there is no way of knowing how they will vote, but because there is no indication of whether they will vote. Moreover, those who have never voted before will make up a huge proportion of those who turn up in the wrong place or with insufficient ID and end up having their credentials questioned. They could play big; they could not play at all; and they may turn up to find Republicans playing dirty. </p> <p>Which brings us to the second phase, which has been under way for the past couple weeks and will culminate tomorrow - mobilising that soft support into hard votes. Here the prognosis for Kerry is mixed. While Bush has pursued a strategy of galvanising his base, Kerry has reached out to the few undecideds in the centre. Arguably, both approaches have their merits. But one of the downsides for Kerry is that he has done little to energise his core support. The extent to which they are motivated is by their hatred for Bush, not their love for him. </p> <p>African Americans, a crucial Democratic constituency, appear particularly ambivalent. At a meeting with black clergy in Philadelphia last month a Floridian minister, Rudolph McKissick, asked Kerry what he was going to do \"to ignite some excitement and energy in the black community\". After a few pat responses, Kerry admitted: \"I'll be honest, I don't know what some of you are waiting for.\" Whatever it is, some black Americans have grown tired of hanging around for it. </p> <p>But while the political will might be weak, the tried and tested organisational structures to mobilise support have proved effective. Early voting - 30 states have already opened the polls - has been heavy in Democrat areas and, thanks to unions and black churches, they have a proven capable machine on the day. Add the new get-out-the-vote organisations friendly to Democrats and the operation begins to look formi dable. This is precisely why the Republicans have been more brazen in their attempts to block the vote. </p> <p>Which brings us to phase three - verification. Fully aware of what is at stake, the Republicans' best hope is to suppress at the polls and then challenge in the courts. Their dominance in local government, where many of the initial decisions regarding voting rights are heard, means Democrats will always be fighting an uphill battle here. </p> <p>Kerry must hope that it doesn't get this far. The Democrats have a far larger potential base than Republicans, but it is also less motivated. Those he was unable to excite to the polls through persuasion he must hope to get there through sheer organisation. If the result isn't close, then the Republicans cannot steal it. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:g.younge@theguardian.com\">g.younge@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Voters in 11 states will decide tomorrow whether to impose constitutional bans on same-sex marriage. <p>Rarely in American history have so many voters - nearly 20% - had a chance to express themselves on such a contentious social issue. Most, if not all, of the bans are expected to win approval, though national gay rights groups are spending heavily in Oregon and a few other states in the hope of avoiding a whitewash. </p> <p>\"We are huge underdogs in every one of these battles,\" said Matt Foreman of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force. \"Our side simply does not have the time, the resources or the infrastructure to beat back the forces being unleashed against us in this election year.\" </p> <p>The ballots result from a backlash to the court ruling almost a year ago that legalised gay marriage in Massachusetts. Seeking extra protection against any such future rulings, legislators in five states and citizens' groups in six others placed proposed constitutional amendments on the ballots that would limit marriage to one man-one woman unions. </p> <p>\"This is an issue that reaches deep and wide across this country,\" said Tony Perkins, president of the conservative Family Research Council. \"The people are taking the lead - they're not waiting for the politicians to act.\"</p>",
  "The final, frenetic phase of campaigning in the US presidential election ends today with the race balanced on a razor's edge, and no certainty the winner will be clear by Wednesday. <p>The eleventh-hour intervention of Osama bin Laden did little to break the deadlock between George Bush and John Kerry: one of the three most recent polls showed Mr Bush moving towards a clear lead, but two had the race tied. </p> <p>With the chances of altering that picture diminishing ever more rapidly, the campaigns reached near-hysterical levels of activity. The candidates, or their surrogates, were scheduled to make more than 30 appearances in 11 states during yesterday, each hammering the issue of terrorism while insisting that the Bin Laden tape would not influence Americans. </p> <p>In the battlegrounds of Florida, Pennsylvania and Ohio, the campaigns deluged television stations with so much political advertising that some announced they had no more space left to sell. </p> <p>In Miami, one pro-Bush ad claimed that \"there really is nothing John Kerry won't say\". A Florida TV station was flooded with complaints after airing a half-hour portion of Stolen Honor, a documentary attacking Mr Kerry's war record, after a private company paid for the airtime. </p> <p>\"It's just unbelievably close. People need to understand that anybody who's being blunt and bold about the outcome of this election now is probably wrong, and if they're right, it's pure luck,\" said Larry Sabato, director of the centre for politics at the University of Virginia. </p> <p>The Bush campaign seized on a Newsweek poll released at the weekend showing the president with a 50% to 44% lead, based partly on responses recorded in the first hours after the release of the bin Laden tape. </p> <p>But in the states most likely to matter, things were looking better for Mr Kerry. In the latest state-by-state tracker poll, compiled by the Los Angeles Times, he was leading by 50% to 45% in Pennsylvania and 50% to 44% in Ohio. Florida was closer, with Mr Kerry leading 48% to 47%. </p> <p>The conventional wisdom is that Mr Kerry needs to win two of the three to have any serious hope of victory. That seems clearly within his grasp and he is also clinging to a lead in Michigan, a traditionally Democratic state, whose loss to the Republicans may well spell disaster. </p> <p>But states which Mr Kerry was confident of winning are looking shaky - above all Hawaii, where he is locked in a dead heat, and where Dick Cheney, the vice-president, was due to fly last night for a rally to help pull off what would be a coup for the Republicans. </p> <p>Both sides know their fates rest not so much with the pronouncements of their candidates as with the paid and volunteer workers charged with getting out the vote. </p> <p>Opinion polls are bad at predicting the influence of the millions of newly-registered voters, among whom Mr Kerry has a 10-point lead, according to a Reuters/Zogby poll released yesterday. </p> <p>Only a small proportion of newly-registered voters make it to a polling booth. But whatever happens tomorrow, history will almost certainly prove to have been a poor guide. </p> <p>\"For once, that old axiom, that it's all in the ground game, is true,\" said Dr Sabato. The get-out-the-vote efforts of each side would cancel each other out, he predicted. </p> <p>\"But there's one exception,\" he said. \"If turnout goes through the roof, Kerry is going to win. There's no way an incumbent can get re-elected in those circumstances. </p> <p>Under the electoral college system, each state has a number of votes approximately proportional to its population, which are awarded on a winner-takes-all basis in most cases. </p> <p>A candidate needs 270 votes, but on the basis of the current polls, neither has anywhere near that number in the bag. And with thousands of lawyers reported to be standing by to challenge results, a close result may lead to the process being dragged out days or even weeks beyond Wednesday. </p> <p>Consequently, as the campaigns focussed their resources, one refrain rang out from analysts and party consultants alike: anyone who claimed to be able to predict the race was either an idiot, a liar, or clairvoyant. </p> <p>\"It's stunning,\" John Zogby, the pollster, said. \"What will happen is that one of the candidates will have a little bit of momentum for two days, and then just when I expect to see the third day continue that momentum, the momentum stops and it goes in the other direction for the other candidate.\"</p>",

  "If Osama bin Laden thought that he could sway the votes of John Kerry supporters such as David and Jan Hill and Bush supporters like Paul Christene, he has another think coming. <p>\"We're dug in,\" said Ms Hill, an accountant in Denver. \"People I know are so polarised, it doesn't make any difference.\" </p> <p>Her husband added that, having been subjected to a constant barrage of adverts from the candidates and a flood of news reports about the election, the Bin Laden tape was just another note in the cacophony. </p> <p>\"I don't think people are really responding any more,\" he said. \"We're shellshocked.\" </p> <p>Many supporters of Mr Bush seemed equally unfazed. </p> <p>\"It doesn't have anything to do with the election,\" said Mr Christene, from Walford, Iowa. \"I will stick with Bush.\" </p> <p>In dozens of interviews on Friday and Saturday in five hotly contested states, such steely sentiments were echoed again and again. Supporters of Mr Bush said the Bin Laden tape had strengthened their resolve to vote Republican by reminding them of the grave threats still faced by the country, while Mr Kerry's supporters said it was yet another reminder that the Bush administration had failed to catch Bin Laden. </p> <p>Of the few voters found by reporters in five cities who had not made up their minds before seeing the tape, none said it had tipped the balance. </p> <p>The snapshot of opinion is hardly detailed, but it may alleviate concerns that voters could be driven towards the Bush camp by Bin Laden's message - or to the Kerry camp by the fact that he is still free. </p> <p>Veronica Gonzalez of St Paul said that the tape certainly scared her, but that she did not know whether Bin Laden's words might influence her vote. </p> <p>\"It's very scary,\" she said. \"I might vote for Bush, but I haven't decided.\" </p> <p>Tyler Lisenbee, from Denver, said he voted for Mr Bush in 2000 but was leaning towards Mr Kerry, mainly because of the war in Iraq. The tape, he said, had not helped him make a choice. </p> <p>\"Bush has been in office all this time, and Osama is still running around,\" Mr Lisenbee said. \"I don't know if Kerry can do a better job, but maybe it's worth trying somebody new.\" </p> <p>Cheryl Hecksler, a teacher and Kerry supporter in Las Vegas, said she had received a call from her mother in California, saying \"something about Bin Laden\". </p> <p>\"I couldn't hear very well on the cellphone, and I thought he'd been captured,\" Ms Hecksler said. </p> <p>\"I was panicked. My first reaction was that Bush would win overwhelmingly. </p> <p>\"Then she told me about the tape, that Bin Laden looked rested, like he'd been on a Caribbean vacation,\" Ms Hecksler said. \"Why is this coming out now?\" </p> <p>Other people agreed that the main thing that was puzzling was not what Bin Laden said, but when he said it. </p> <p>\"All I can say is, wow, it's perfect timing for him to come out of the woodwork,\" said McKinley Olds, 33, a warehouse worker in Cleveland, Ohio. \"It doesn't make any difference to me, I'm still voting for Kerry.\" </p> <p>Another Kerry supporter in Ohio, Ruth Twaddell, 53, of Chagrin Falls, said that she worried about the effect of the tape on other voters. </p> <p>\"This raises people's fears, and Bush preys upon their insecurities,\" said Ms Twaddell. </p> <p>\"I don't feel personally fearful, but I know there's plenty of people for whom it's in the forefront of their minds.\" </p> <p>Other people debated Bin Laden's intent. Some were convinced that he wanted four more years of Mr Bush, others that he wanted Mr Kerry to be elected. </p> <p>\"For people who are on the margin, it helps Bush, because it resurrects the fear that something might happen; and I think that was the obvious intention,\" said Jeff Sanders, an engineer in Denver who supports Mr Kerry. </p> <p>\"What Bin Laden is afraid of is Kerry's ability to create an international coalition that would really deal with terrorism.\" </p> <p>The one undisputed fact was that Bin Laden was still out there. The question, many people said, was what that meant to Americans. </p> <p>Ron Blake, a Californian on holiday in Las Vegas, said he admired Bin Laden's gall. </p> <p>\"They've spent all this time looking for the guy and here he pops up, none the worse for wear,\" said Mr Blake. </p> <p>\"After all was said and done, we didn't get him.\"</p>",
  "As the US election campaign today entered its final hours, the president, George Bush, and his Democratic party challenger, John Kerry, were criss-crossing several states in a final push to secure every available vote. <p>With the polls predicting an extremely tight race, Mr Bush launched himself on a six-state, seven-stop tour stretching from early morning into late night, mostly in the Midwest. Mr Kerry was also working his way across the country, making six stops in four states. </p> <p>The candidates' hectic schedules were expected to bring them within three blocks and one hour of each other at noon (1800 GMT) in Milwaukee, Wisconsin - a battleground state in which support for each man is roughly even.</p> <p>As the sun rose in Wilmington, Ohio, this morning, governor Bob Taft warmed up Mr Bush's crowd of several thousand supporters in an aeroplane hangar. \"He's been everywhere,\" he said of the president. \"He's putting his heart and his soul on the line for us, for our families, for our future. We have got to do the same.\" </p> <p>Both sides had grass roots campaigners primed for action to get the vote out. They also had teams of lawyers deployed across the country, braced for legal action at the first sign of polling irregularities.</p> <p>\"I expect this election is going to be decided Tuesday night,\" Mr Kerry told the Associated Press, \"but, given experience, I would be irresponsible if I wasn't prepared to be able to protect every person's right to vote.\" </p> <p>In an interview broadcast today on ABC's \"Good Morning America,\" Mr Kerry predicted \"a record turnout\" and said he believed Americans were \"determined not to see a repeat of 2000\", when Mr Bush won the presidency after a post-election tussle over the Florida count, which was finally resolved by the supreme court. </p> <p>The president said it was vital to see a clear winner emerge on election night, especially considering how closely the process would be watched around the world. </p> <p>\"We'll see how it goes Tuesday night, but I really think it's important not to have a world of lawsuits that stop the will of the people from going forward,\" Mr Bush told the Dateline NBC television programme. </p> <p>Whichever way the contest goes, the end of the long, bruising campaign is likely to be welcomed - at least privately - by both men, who have begun to appear physically tired in recent days. </p> <p>Mr Kerry showed signs of hoarseness during his speech at a rally in Tampa, Florida, last night. Meanwhile, Mr Bush has stocked up on lozenges and cut down on caffeine, which constricts the vocal cords, according to the presidential adviser Karl Rove. Mr Bush was stumping in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Iowa and New Mexico today, before a crowning home-state rally in Dallas and a night at his Crawford ranch. The vice-president, Dick Cheney, flew to Hawaii for a late-night rally before heading back to the mainland early today. </p> <p>Mr Kerry spent last night in Florida, with two stops in Ohio, two in Wisconsin and one in Michigan lined up for today. Aides said the Massachusetts senator would then fly home to Boston to vote and carry forward his election day tradition - lunch at the Union Oyster House.</p> <p>His running mate, the North Carolina senator John Edwards, was campaigning in the Midwest and Florida.</p> <p>The final scramble caps the most expensive political advertising campaign in history, with more than $600m (\u00a3330m) having been spent by the Bush and Kerry camps.</p>",
  "When George Bush makes his last speech at his last rally today, there will be nothing left for him to do but go home to Texas and hand over the final task in the effort to get him re-elected to a brigade of passionate enthusiasts like Dorothy Niklos. <p>Ms Niklos is a Bush lieutenant in the campaign's ground war - the election-day struggle to turn out the vote. And in an evenly-split state like Pennsylvania, where just about everyone has seen all the political advertising they can stand, and all but the pathologically indecisive have made up their minds long ago, turning out the vote is all that matters. </p> <p>\"I'm a broken-glass Republican, I'll crawl over broken glass to go vote,\" says Ms Niklos, who runs the Republican get-out-the-vote effort in Northampton County, in Pennsylvania's Lehigh Valley - a swing region in a swing state. \"Other people may support us on the ideas, but they may need a nudge with follow-up calls and maybe get a visit.\" </p> <p>Ms Niklos's job is to make sure such nudges are felt wherever they can make a difference. She is the sort of person every party wants on their side. A chatty partisan of boundless energy, she is girding herself for her role in tomorrow's climactic test of strength in her \"victory centre\", a modest single-storey building, painted duck-egg blue, in the small town of Nazareth. </p> <p>The place hums with political commitment. Next door to Ms Niklos's office there is a narrow room lined with desks and telephones where a dozen determined activists spend monotonous hours dialling hundreds of numbers and talking, mostly, to answering machines. </p> <p>The fact that anyone picks up the phone at all in Northampton county is testament to the patience and good manners of the local population; a mix of farmers, office workers and commuters who travel each day across to Newark and New York. In these last stages of the campaign, many are getting up to eight political calls a day. </p> <p>Sharon Retos, a volunteer, has a party loyalist on the line who is having trouble persuading his wife. </p> <p>\"Oh dear, oh dear. Remind her of 9/11. Remind her of partial-birth abortion,\" Ms Retos counsels. A ban on late-term abortions, a staple of the Christian conservative agenda, was signed into law by Mr Bush in the teeth of concerted Democratic resistance. </p> <p>\"You know her sensitivities. You hit her on partial-birth abortion. You just keep talking to her. We'll win with or without her vote, but we sure would appreciate it.\" </p> <p>Half a dozen sales pitches are underway at any one time. Meanwhile, a steady flow of volunteers wanders in and out with an offer to drive voters to the polls, or to ask for posters and yard signs. Ms Niklos claims 1,500 Republican signs have been stolen or defaced by the opposition, and the Democrats have made similar claims. The yard sign \"dirty war\" is a regular part of the election ritual, but this year both sides agree it is - like most things about this campaign - nastier, more organised and bigger. </p> <p><b> Tough slog</b><br> </p> <p> The ground war is a tough, glamour-free slog, and it's the phase of the battle the Democrats are traditionally best at. Karl Rove, the president's electoral Svengali, was reportedly traumatised by the experience of the 2000 election. His candidate glided into polling day with an opinion poll edge over Al Gore of several percentage points, a comfier cushion than he enjoys now over John Kerry. </p> <p>But that lead evaporated on the day, as the Democrats and their union allies showed their superior muscle when it came to translating support into votes. In the end, half a million more people voted for Mr Gore than Mr Bush, who was saved only by the quirks of the electoral system. </p> <p>Mr Rove and the national Republican chairman, Ken Mehlman, have spent much of the past four years trying to make sure that does not happen again. Between them they have built a new model army for the ground war, along the lines of an American corporate sales model, known as multi-level marketing. It sounds intricate, but is basically a pyramid scheme in which every recruit is set not only production goals but quotas for finding new recruits. Discipline and commitment produce an ever-expanding self-perpetuating network. </p> <p>Thus far it has worked. In four years, the Republicans have built a get-out-the-vote machine to rival the apparatus built by the Democrats over generations. </p> <p>\"This is the biggest thing I've ever worked on,\" Ms Niklos said. In 2000, the Republicans in Pennsylvania, as elsewhere, relied more on television advertising and direct mail, personally targeted letters. There were a few dozen volunteers mobilised to go door-to-door in September, but almost as an afterthought. </p> <p>This year Ms Niklos had activists working in all Northampton County's 145 precincts from April, and now has a force of 1,500, as well as out-of-towners driving in from Virginia and New York where the presidential contest is more one-sided. </p> <p>\"The first phone banks were set up in March,\" she says. \" In 2000, they weren't up until July. Then there was voter ID, we called people and asked them how they felt about abortion and stem cells and guns. And then in May we began calling back again targeting each group. Then there was voter registration in summer, and now we are getting the vote out.\" </p> <p>It is without doubt an impressive apparatus, rapidly built, but largely untested. The unanswered question is whether it can match the proven efficiency of the Democratic machine, which is also swollen with new recruits. </p> <p>\"I've never seen anything like it,\" said Joe Long, the county Democratic leader. \"The 2000 election was nothing compared to this.\" Mr Bush lost Northampton County by 5,701 votes four years ago. Mr Long believes the margin will be bigger this time. </p> <p>He has won the first round against Ms Niklos, signing up thousands more voters. There are now 84,000 registered Democrats in the county, compared with 67,500 Republicans. Across Pennsylvania, the number of Democrats has risen by 267,000 since 2000, the number of registered Republicans has risen by only 155,000. </p> <p>But until tomorrow, those are just numbers on paper. Ms Niklos believes that in their rush to boost their registration figures, the Democrats have signed up thousands of residents who have little intention of actually voting. Her voters, she believes, will turn up. </p> <p>Tomorrow will tell. Until then, the power of the new Republican machine is one of the great remaining unknowns of the presidential race.</p>",
  "<p>US presidential rivals George Bush and John Kerry have spent more than $600m on TV and radio ads in the run-up to tomorrow's election, making it the most expensive campaign in American political history.</p> <p>The two candidates and their supporters have spent three times as much as in 2000 when Senator Al Gore narrowly lost the presidency to Mr Bush.</p> <p>And the rise of multimillion pound campaigns from pressure groups such as the Swift Boat Veterans For Truth alongside the ad blitz by the Democrats and Republicans has taken the total spending on political and so-called issue advertising to over $1bn since the start of the year, according to US tracking group TNS Media Intelligence.</p> <p>\"The story this whole year has been the sheer volume of ads,\" said Evan Tracey, president of TNS Media Intelligence/Campaign Media Analysis Group. \"This is an election that I think changes politics.\"</p> <p>Though the result of the election is widely being described as too close to call, Mr Kerry's campaign is marginally ahead of his Republican rival.</p> <p>The Democrats spent about $250m on TV and radio commercials between March and September, $10m more than Mr Bush's campaign spend.</p> <p>And spending by left-leaning pressure groups such as The Media Fund stretches the Democrat spending lead still further.</p> <p>Liberal groups have poured around $70m into adverts backing Mr Kerry, while Republican groups spent just $40m.</p> <p>The Media Fund, set up by a former aide to Bill Clinton, emerged as the highest spending liberal group, pumping $55m into political ads. Its main Conservative rival, Progress for America Voter Fund, spent just $20m.</p> <p>While the 2004 presidential campaign has been one of the longest on record - the Republican party started its TV campaign against Senator Kerry in the spring - it has concentrated on around a dozen swing states where the outcome of Tuesday's election is expected to be decided.</p> <p>Residents of Toledo, Ohio for example were blitzed with just under 15,000 TV and radio ads between March and September, according to TNS Media Intelligence research. </p> <p>Tampa residents could have watched 200 ads in a single day on the penultimate Saturday before the election, while on the same day people living in other swing cities such as Las Vegas, Cleveland and Milwaukee had between 100-150 ads to contemplate.</p> <p>But in around two-thirds of the country the volume of campaign ads has been much more subdued.</p> <p>Most television spending has been on national and local cable channels, with the Democrats favouring the news channels and the Republicans targeting male voters and buying into sports and outdoor shows, TNS reports.</p> <p>The Democrats have been the cannier media buyers, snapping up spots at lower prices even if this meant opting for slots showing at different times than they would have wanted.</p> <p>Records from a TV station in Cleveland quoted by TNS, reveal that Kerry's campaign spent $250 for a single spot between 9 am and 10 am on October 5, compared with the $375 paid by the Republicans in the same period. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<p>It was a hell of an ad. Republican Joel Trella, described as \"Sheriff Moonbeam\" because of his publicly funded interest in astrology, was depicted as being supposedly busy consulting the alignment of the stars while a series of inmates escape from the Bergen County jail. It began with an alarm bell and sirens, while a Homer Simpson soundalike sang that line in Aquarius from the musical Hair: \"When the moon is in the seventh house...\"</p> <p>In New York, the world's media and advertising capital, this bizarre spot, paid for by Democrat challenger for Bergen County sheriff, Leo McGuire, was the first political ad I had seen in weeks - that is, during the commercial breaks and not on the news.</p> <p>I know you can't possibly believe me. Haven't Kerry and Bush spent $1bn on their campaigns? Haven't they blitzed the airwaves with blanket tit-for-tat vitriol for months? Surely this is just about me being a typical British TV snob in the Big Apple watching only re-runs of the Office on BBC America, Sunday nights on the commercial-free HBO and Fox Sports World for the Premier League.</p> <p>Well I do, but I am also addicted to the radical ABC smash hit Desperate Housewives, not to mention the ratings champion CBS franchise CSI Miami, CSI New York, and CSI Las Vegas, or wherever the original is set. I tune in to the old favourite Will and Grace and the new creeper Boston Legal. I was totally engrossed by the high-rating Major League Baseball play-offs. And, my guilty pleasure is a morbid addiction to Fox's obscenely tasteless \"reality\" makeover saga The Swan.</p> <p>This is mainstream stuff, but you don't see any Bush-Kerry ads lurking in the breaks. The most expensive, vitriolic, media savvy and just plain long advertising battle in US presidential history has largely passed the Big Apple's paid media airtime by. Democrat New York is not a swing state. If you care to, you will still have seen the ugly stuff - on David Letterman's talk show or 20/20's old-style documentary analysis - but in a context with talking heads or comedians judging them.</p> <p>Of course ad junkies are also able to go to adcritic.com or adage.com or even the bizarre new force in this election the \"527\" pressure groups websites. The 527s are the political groups that were formed from a loophole in the Internal Revenue Code, the act that sought to restrict the amounts individuals ($1,000) and corporate political action committees ($5,000) could donate to candidates. The 527 can raise unlimited amounts of soft money.</p> <p>The most notable of these is the Swift Boat Veterans and PoWs for Truth, the anti-Kerry pressure group - supposedly not aligned to the Republicans - that has spent an astonishing $20m since the beginning of August on ads slamming Kerry's Vietnam war record, mostly in swing states. It was created by the relatively unknown Saatchi &amp; Saatchi of US political advertising, the Alexandria, Virginia-based Stevens Reed Curcio &amp; Potholm (which also created John McCain's campaign in 2000 and George Bush Snr's in 1988).</p> <p>If you had to pick a winner in the ad war, you would have to go for their remarkably left field campaign. Going into this endless campaign (and don't think it will conclude tomorrow) Kerry's medal-winning Vietnam service record as a Swift Boat captain seemed to be his trump card, especially in contrast to President Bush's did he/didn't he? National Guard service.</p> <p>But the endless harping by some of his Vietnam vet peers on about whether Kerry did actually deserve his medals, and then his subsequent record as a war protester upon his return, really damaged the Democrat candidate's campaign through the summer and the party convention periods. The phrase \"flip-flop\" also stuck to denote Kerry's allegedly contradictory record on voting and policies.</p> <p>It was the only serious blow landed in the avalanche of ads, many of them shamelessly exploiting the events of 9/11 or vicious character assassinations. Although Kerry's campaign became professional enough to be able to respond to specific attack ads within an astonishing four hours, it never struck a single killer blow.</p> <p>We'll soon find out whether he really has come back to the deadheat situation that so many polls are predicting. And if so, he has done it by other means, most notably a strong showing in the televised debates - which are essentially glorified long commercials for both sides, and realising belatedly that he can score points on the continuing chaos and still rising death toll in Iraq.</p> <p>And, as with the wider ad industry today, the televised commercial is but part of the marketer's arsenal of weapons. Tens of millions of dollars went into direct mail door-drops and face to face marketing on the ground in those swing states. The Republicans had just 22 full-time workers on the ground in Florida last time around, this year they have 500. The Democrats reported an increase in activists nationwide from 90,000 to 250,000 in 2004. The lucky people of Ohio have seen Kerry 26 times in this race. Pennsylvania has become Bush's second home.</p> <p>Both sides spend unknown last-minute millions on what is euphemistically termed \"walkaround\" money: the 200-year-old tradition of giving voters cash to allow them to travel to the polling station. And, if they don't spend all the money on travelling to vote? Well, bribery is a contentious term.</p> <p>As a consequence the great unknown of this election is what the real effect of the hordes of newly registered voters for 2004 will be. From African-Americans still seething about alleged injustices in Florida four years ago to thousands of young people sparked into political activity by their views on the war in Iraq.</p> <p>The other great advertising winners of this election then are the various \"Rock the Vote\" and \"Vote or Die\" campaigns championed by any and everyone from Jennifer Aniston to Puff Daddy, Michael Douglas to Eminem. These ads have been on TV even in Democrat shoo-in New York and other non-swing states. Their success has resulted in a projected increase in the total number of voters from 106 million in 200 to 121 million this year. We'll see if they actually vote.</p> <p>So, it has been an ad battle unlike anything seen in the UK, or indeed in American history. It has been extraordinarily targeted, and of course, vicious. Perhaps the Bush team - and its allies - have shaded the ad battle. Whether this means anything on the day we can only wait and see. But the sheer interest in the outcome and number of voters anticipated is testimony to the power of political marketing.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "<p>A victory for John Kerry in tomorrow's US presidential election might be seen as a heralding a more peaceful foreign policy by many in the UK - but it would stoke international trade disputes, believe British economists.</p> <p>Both George W Bush and Kerry are calling for free and fair trade but the Democrats are traditionally more assertive about protecting American jobs, notes Dr Heidi Ullrich, of the London School of Economics. \"Kerry is saying we need to keep jobs in the US,\" she says, adding that there would be much more emphasis on \"buying American\" by companies and government procurement agencies.</p> <p>\"There would be no radical changes but with Kerry we would see more of an assertive American trade policy to help US workers,\" notes Ms Ullrich. But she points out that the president will have to work closely with a Republican Congress, limiting a Democrat's freedom of manoeuvre. Kerry's promise to halve the US deficit will also have an impact, though it will be heavily dependent on what happens in world trade over the next four years.</p> <p>Kerry is also more likely to precipitate arguments with China and other developing nations by promoting environmental standards, labour rights, and tackling child labour abuses through the World Trade Organisation (WTO). China argues that these are in effect protectionism by the developed nations.</p> <p>Wyn Grant, professor of politics at Warwick University, believes existing trade disputes will be exacerbated and become harder to resolve with a more assertive Democratic policy in place. Issues like genetic modification of crops, where the US is trying to break down European resistance, will continue under either President Bush or President Kerry - \"Big companies donate to both parties. I don't think we are going to see a very different line from a Democrat administration.\"</p> <p>Bush backed down over his attempts to protect the American steel industry and, while steel is buoyant there isn't a problem. \"But if demand for steel falls, we could get all these disputes flaring up again,\" says Prof Grant.</p> <p>Like so much else these days international trade is dependent on what happens in China. India and Brazil are also growing big enough to challenge the dominance of the present G8 countries but China is the leader of this pack and expected to become the world's largest economy between 2030 and 2040.</p> <p>Prof Grant adds: \"The whole western economy is dependent on growth in China. At the moment they are trying to cool their economy and if China is importing less from the west this could have a serious deflationary impact.\"</p> <p>The dollar, says Prof Grant, has been having a \"torrid time\" because of the size of the US deficit which has ballooned under Bush. Kerry intends to half it, but not all the levers are in the hands of the president and he would be dependent on a Republican Congress. If successful this would have beneficial effects, believes Prof Grant, but there must be grave doubts about whether he could.</p> <p>Worse from an economic point of view would be prolonged uncertainty about the result and legal battles in a number of states, he adds. \"A decision either one way or the other would be better for the world and American democracy. A contested close finish in as many as five states would be very damaging in terms of American leadership and the economy.\"</p> <p>A second Bush term would raise questions about the competence of his administration with several of the most able members like Condoleeza Rice expected to leave. Prof Grant adds wryly that with the gravity of the international problems in the four years ahead for the US president, there are Republicans who feel that four years of Kerry might be better than eight years of Hilary Clinton starting in 2008.</p>",
  "Hudson, Ohio is instantly recognisable, even to people who have never heard of it. Clapboard-sided buildings surround a village green, the bandstand sports red, white and blue bunting and the leafy streets are lined with tidy sidewalks. Right away visitors know they are in small town America. <p>\"It's just like Disney World's Main Street USA!\" exclaimed a recent visitor and, indeed, Hudson's 150-year-old shop fronts look very much like the amusement park's evocation of hometown America circa 1900. Hudson appears so gently familiar that it has been used as a set for movies.</p> <p>I know this town intimately. I was born and raised here across from a cornfield. I rode my first bicycle on its sidewalks and enjoyed ice cream cones at the marble soda fountain at Saywell's drugstore. I cast my first vote here and I got my first job in journalism as the editor of the weekly Hudson Times, circulation 3,200.</p> <p>Coming back today, I find my hometown is polarised by the presidential elections. I have not seen neighbours and friends so bitterly divided and dismissive of each other since 1970, when Richard Nixon was president and people argued about the Vietnam war. Animosity was so thick then you could cut it with a knife. Just 10 miles away, at Kent State University, four students were shot dead by government troops and people in Hudson had raging rows over whether or not those killings were justified.</p> <p>George W Bush and the Iraq war have reopened Hudson's political fault lines and rekindled simmering antipathies. The stakes are high here as Ohio is rated as a key swing state. It is a populous midwestern state that boasts 20 electoral college votes, one of the largest in the country. It has big industrial cities like Cleveland and Akron, agricultural areas and plenty of small towns like Hudson. This cross section of urban and rural makes Ohio a bellwether state which picks the winner in almost every election. No Republican has ever won the White House without taking Ohio; Democrats have only done so twice.</p> <p>Hudson's residents know Ohio's strategic importance of Ohio and the political campaigning is at a fever pitch. \"I invited my neighbour over for dinner and once we started talking about politics and the war in Iraq, we had a blazing argument. I became so angry, I couldn't believe it,\" said Linda Crotteau, 61, who supports John Kerry. \"I had to go over to her house the next day and apologise for being so angry. But now she no longer waves when we see each other.\"</p> <p>Mrs Crotteau, a speech pathologist, finds she cannot do campaign work in Hudson because she loses her temper with the many Bush supporters. Instead she is canvassing for Kerry door to door in the nearby city of Akron. \"The main issue here in Hudson is the war on terror and the war in Iraq. For people in Akron, particularly the African-American community, the issue is the economy. People are struggling. One woman told me, 'If Bush wins again, we will probably lose our house.' Bush is making us a country of the rich and the poor. The middle class is being squeezed out.\"</p> <p>Mrs Crotteau's mission to convince undecided voters to vote for Kerry starts at home. Her husband is not sure who he will vote for. \"I don't really talk to him about it, because I know that a hard pitch from me will turn him off. But I think the news about Iraq will do it. When we watch the news, we just look at each other and he knows what I'm thinking.\"</p> <p>One neighbour asked a member of her bridge group not to park in front of her house because she had a Kerry sticker on her car.</p> <p>Hudson has traditionally been a conservative town that is solidly Republican. The Republican headquarters on Main Street are decked out in bright red, white and blue elephants and staffed with cheerful volunteers. But when they are questioned about the issues, their message is serious. \"I don't feel sorry for poor people,\" said one woman. \"They had choices.\" When the Observer's photographer, Gary Calton, says that he is working with me, the Republican sniffs, \"Oh, the Meldrums, they are a very liberal family.\" Liberal is said with a sneer as if it is a dirty word. </p> <p>But there are signs that Hudson's longtime reputation as a Republican centre is changing. \"The joke has always been that you could fit all Hudson's Democrats into the phone booth at Saywell's drugstore,\" says Susan Terkel, a leader of the Kerry campaign in Hudson. \"But now lots of Democrats have come out of the closet. The former mayor is campaigning for Kerry and lots of others. We had a gathering of 400 people which was exciting. But now some Republicans are boycotting the restaurant where we had the meeting. Isn't that terrible?\"</p> <p>Hudson is now having \"the war of the signs\". \"At night people take down signs they don't like. Last week someone went to a house that had a Kerry sign and burned a big W in their lawn,\" said Mrs Terkel. \"It's getting ugly.\" An 84-year-old widow had two Kerry signs taken from her front yard, but when she put up two small American flags next to her third Kerry placard, it was left alone. Alex Arshinkoff has a 32ft sign for Bush on his front yard on one of Hudson's busiest streets. The sign is so big that it violates city codes and Mr Arshinkoff has been fined $75 per day. Mr Arshinkoff, who is chairman of Summit County's Republican party, is taking the matter to court in order to keep the sign up.</p> <p>Everyone in town goes to the Hudson high school football games on Friday nights. The football is a draw but so are the performances by the marching band. With 320 students in snappy blue and white uniforms playing shiny trumpets, trombones and tubas as they march in briskly changing formations, the band's numbers are full of razzmatazz. It's not surprising to learn that the band frequently appears on national television.</p> <p>Flag waving patriotism is also on display at the football match and several people sport Bush buttons. \"OH4W\" is worn by many. \"You can talk about the election campaign here at the football game, as long as you support Bush,\" grumbled one mother. \"But if you support Kerry, everybody jumps on you and questions your patriotism, so I just keep my mouth shut. But I am voting for Kerry.\"</p> <p>From all appearances, Hudson, Ohio looks like a typical American small town, with unified, cohesive population. But I can see that the current presidential election campaign has highlighted divisions that will be evident long after voting day.</p>",
  "The banner behind George Bush in a concrete Miami exhibition hall promised a \"safer, stronger and better\" America. It was lettered red on black, like a government terrorist alert. <p>When Lincoln Diaz-Balart, a fire-breathing Cuban-American congressman, asked the 4,000-strong crowd: \"Who do the enemies of America favour for this election? Who do the tyrants and terrorists support?\" the answer was instant and deafening: \"John Kerry.\" </p> <p>Although the president did not say anything about Bin Laden's threat, blanket coverage on television had ensured it set the tone for everything that was said and done on the campaign trail. </p> <p>\"This guy is trying to send a message he may hit us again, and that's why we need President Bush - he's a leader,\" said George Albert, a veteran of the Korean war. </p> <p>Around his neck, he wore a badge depicting two cartoon Uncle Sams standing in front of the US and British flags declaring: \"We support our troops.\" </p> <p>On the penultimate day of the Bush re-election effort, the crowd chanting \"four more years\" had all seen Bin Laden on television, and heard his threats. They did not have to be told what it meant. </p> <p>Jeb Bush, the Florida governor, spoke first, introducing his brother, the president, in Spanish for the benefit of the largely Cuban-American audience. Neither mentioned Bin Laden by name. </p> <p>Mr Bush stuck to his regular stump speech, peppering it with the official slogan of the last few days of the campaign: \"Come stand with me.\" It focused mainly on domestic concerns, with a few digressions on Cuba. There was no talk of Iraq or Afghanistan. </p> <p>There were no new asides about Bin Laden's surprise appearance on Friday and the president only dwelt on terrorism as an amorphous threat. </p> <p>\"All progress on other issues depends on the safety of your families,\" he declared. \"If America shows uncertainty or weakness as we go through troubled times, the world will drift towards tragedy. </p> <p>\"This is not going to happen on my watch.\" The promise is at the core of the Bush campaign as it enters its last full day today. </p> <p>White House aides have become extremely careful about publicly guessing the impact of Bin Laden's \"October surprise\". </p> <p>\"It's kryptonite for both sides,\" one travelling official said, and in a exquisitely poised contest like this, neither wants to risk disaster. </p> <p>Behind the scenes the battle is over how to shape the media coverage of each candidate's response. The Bush camp accuses Senator Kerry of trying to turn the incident to political advantage, by criticising the president for his failure to catch the al-Qaida leader. </p> <p>\"I think Bush's response really helped him. It shows he can handle the problem much better than Kerry. Kerry just did a political spin,\" said Jordan Birch, a New York activist who had joined the all-out Republican effort to hold Florida. \"Bringing a new administration this late in the game, there is no way they can catch up. This administration has been dealing with the problem for years.\" </p> <p>That was the view, at least, from Bush world. No one yet knows how the Bin Laden factor might play among the remaining undecided voters, if such people still exist. But the tone and body language of Bush campaign officials has become noticeably more bullish. </p> <p>Scott McClellan, the White House spokesman who returned to the campaign trail after a short absence, apparently to help steer the Bin Laden affair, held up both arms in front of the travelling press and shouted: \"Vamos a ganar\" (We are going to win). It was a joking reference to the Hispanic flavour of the venue, but even being able to joke at this stage of the game is a display of confidence. </p> <p>Everyone in the Bush caravan as it made its way from Florida to Ohio last night was well aware that their team was just as cocky on the eve of the 2000 election. </p> <p>And yet, if it had not been for a few hanging chads and assorted twists of Florida electoral law, Mr Bush would have lost. Since then the Bush campaign has built a national volunteer network that is 250,000-strong, and is designed to do what the Democratic machine did in 2000: turn out the vote. </p> <p>But no one knows if the Republicans' green volunteers can match the battle-hardened union and student activists on the other side. </p> <p>Mr Birch worried that the long queues at the polling booths would discourage older, Republican voters, at a time when Miami is sweltering through an unseasonably hot autumn. </p> <p>His friend and fellow New York volunteer, Dan O'Leary, agreed. </p> <p>\"It comes down to the voting,\" Mr O'Leary said. \"It's definitely not in the bag.\" </p> <p><b>Florida </b></p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Florida is the biggest swing state with a population of 17 million </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> It has 27 votes in the electoral college, making it a key battleground</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> The governor of the state is Jeb Bush, the president' younger brother, who also presided over the 2000 election</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> In that election, the Bush margin of victory was 537 - 0.009% of Florida's voters</p>",
  "The prospect of a second round run-off ballot in the Ukrainian presidential election was looming today as the two main candidates were less than a percentage point apart with almost all votes counted, officials said. <p>After yesterday's poll the prime minister, Viktor Yanukovych, with 40.1% of the vote, had a slender lead over his reformist challenger, Viktor Yushchenko, who had 39.2%, the central elections commission said. </p> <p>The commission described the tally as unofficial preliminary results and did not say when a 100% count would be announced. But the figures made it mathematically impossible for either candidate to reach the 50% majority needed for a first-round victory. A run-off poll would be held on November 21. </p> <p>The outcome in a run-off could depend on which of the two men the other candidates in the field of 24 decide to support in the country's fourth presidential election.</p> <p>Mr Yanukovich is the establishment's candidate in the former Soviet republic and is backed by Moscow, with his power base centred around the industrialised east. </p> <p>His main rival, who is popular in the nationalist west, is more favourable to western countries and is reformist in outlook. Mr Yushchenko, himself a former prime minister, has accused the outgoing president, Leonid Kuchma, of being corrupt.</p> <p>There have also been claims and counter-claims about irregularities in the presidential poll. The election commission reportedly asked the public prosecutor to investigate claims of irregularities as speculation grew that the government might declare the vote void and introduce a state of emergency.</p> <p>Last night the Ukrainian opposition had claimed victory despite various exit polls indicating no candidate would get the necessary 50% of the vote.</p> <p>The opposition had also urged the public not to protest against the alleged irregularities for fear of unrest, the Guardian's Nick Paton Walsh reported from Kiev. </p> <p>He said large groups of people had milled around the capital's pedestrianised streets waiting for news of the exit polls.</p> <p>The EU and the US have expressed concern at some aspects of the campaign and called for a clean vote. However, western observers praised the turnout, which was almost 75% of the electorate.</p>",
  "<p>The International Federation of Journalists has backed a decision by more than 200 Ukrainian journalists to refuse to work on politically \"censored\" broadcasts in the run-up to the country's presidential elections.</p> <p>The IFJ said it supported the \"courage and defiance\" of the journalists who stood firm despite widespread intimidation by management and the authorities.</p> <p>In the run-up to the elections, journalists had accused television stations of deliberately favouring the pro-Russia candidate, Viktor Yanukovych, and denying airtime to his pro-West rival, Viktor Yushenko.</p> <p>Mr Yanukovych, who has the support of Ukraine's business and security elite, has dominated the country's airtime.</p> <p>Staff at independent TV station Channel 5 went on hunger strike last week after its bank accounts were frozen and its licence to broadcast revoked.

  "Canadians believe the US presidential election will have a greater impact on them than their own recent general election did, a new poll has shown. <p>Matters have gone far beyond dislike or disapproval - many Canadians loathe the US president, George Bush, and are fervently hoping that John Kerry will be victorious in tomorrow's election.</p> <p>Poll after poll has shown that a majority of Canadians want the Democrat to win Tuesday's vote, but a new survey, published in the Canadian edition of Time magazine this week, revealed just how visceral anti-Bush sentiment has become.</p> <p>\"Canadians see him as a sorcerer's apprentice leading the US and the world over a cliff. It is a somewhat irrational demonisation,\" says Frank Graves, one of Canada's leading pollsters. </p> <p>In an interview, Mr Graves said the new survey showed Canadians were \"apoplectic\" about the possibility that Mr Bush would win again, believing that a victory for him would be a blow to world peace and stability.</p> <p>Not all Canadians feel this way, but a strong majority do. The survey found that 64% want to see Mr Kerry triumph, while only 19% would prefer to see Mr Bush remaining in office. </p> <p>The strong opposition to the US president appears to be due to his swaggering, sometimes sneering, style, and the \"ham-fisted way\" in which he has handled the conflict in Iraq. Canadians opposed the US-led invasion, and supported their own government's decision not to join US-led forces - a stance that has grown stronger as time has gone on.</p> <p>The public's strong emotional reaction to Mr Bush is shared by some elected politicians. As US-led forces prepared to invade Iraq last year, the Liberal MP Carolyn Parrish said: \"Damn Americans. I hate those bastards.\" She later apologised. </p> <p>Her remarks were extreme, and not a reflection - according to the polls - of how Canadians feel about ordinary Americans. It is President Bush and his administration they dislike.</p> <p>Even senior members of Paul Martin's Liberal government have publicly expressed a clear preference for Mr Kerry, saying they feel more comfortable with his style and agenda.</p> <p>The new poll showed Canadians are hopeful that, if Mr Kerry wins, he will improve US performance on environmental issues and trade. </p> <p>Mr Kerry appears to be more committed to progressive environmental policies than President Bush, but there is little sign that the Democratic challenger - who has the support of organised labour - would be a particular friend to Canada and reverse the protectionist trade measures adopted by Mr Bush and the Republicans.</p> <p>It is, says Mr Graves, \"frankly naive\" to believe that Mr Kerry would be any more sympathetic to - or even more interested in - long-standing disputes with Canada over soft wood lumber or beef imports than Mr Bush. </p> <p>The US is Canada's closest ally and trading partner. Canada sends 85% of its exports to the US, but is used to being ignored or bullied on the trade front by its enormously powerful southern neighbour. </p> <p>Now Canadians have deep and growing concerns that the US has lost its way. \"It is like sleeping with an elephant who is an insomniac,\" says Mr Graves.</p>",
  "Tom Wolfe casts his gaze across America at this election time, with eyes that change mood in a nanosecond, with a flicker. For the most part, they exude an amused elegance befitting the hallmark white suit and dandy-ish two-tone brogues. But then the look suddenly changes, to become scalpel-sharp, mischievous, seizing upon some detail. It is a metamorphosis which begins to explain, perhaps, how this softly-spoken, immaculately-mannered gentleman journalist from the South can write with such voracity about the grime and sediment which inhabits American society and the human soul. <p>Certainly the view is stirring from the place to which he retreats to write, and where we meet: his outrageously beautiful Manhattan apartment taking up the 14th floor of a block on the Upper East Side, with sweeping views over a Central Park drenched in autumnal sunshine. A grand piano sits in the corner, painted in what Wolfe calls \"cocktail lounge navy blue\". Shelves are stacked with books on 19th-century, modern and Dutch art. In what he calls his office, next to the sitting room, is a huge, handsome and ornate bureau on which sits handwriting instruments and two panama hats. </p> <p>From this desk, and the pen of arguably America's greatest current writer - author of the 1987 epic Bonfire of the Vanities and much more besides - there now comes a third major novel, I Am Charlotte Simmons, to be published next week, on the other side of election day. Wolfe set out, for the first time, to write the book on a computer, but gave up in favour of his usual typewriter. \"Then I jammed my finger badly,\" he says, \"and took up pen and paper. This may turn out to be the last book ever written that way.\" </p> <p>A new Tom Wolfe novel is always a literary event: where will he go next? The answer this time is an elite, imaginary Ivy League university, Dupont College, for a book about libido off the leash, and about the cult of what Wolfe calls \"the bad comedy\" of college sports - athletes taken on by centres of academic excellence for their bodies, not their brains. </p> <p>The novel - researched, as usual, down to the last expletive - concerns a young world speaking \"fuck patois\", loaded with creatine and cocaine, numbed by PlayStation 3, and charged by alcohol, the \"vile spleen\" of rap and, above all, ubiquitous sex between the heirs and heiresses to privilege in America. Most intriguingly, in this week of all weeks in American history, the book affords a gateway towards explaining Wolfe's boldly delivered, tantalising, remark: \"I have sympathy with what George Bush is trying to do, although obviously the excursion [into Iraq] is not going well.\" </p> <p>Four years ago, Wolfe wrote an essay to mark the millennium called Hooking Up, about what he called \"feverish emphasis on sex and sexiness\". In a way, the new novel is a literary fruition of the essay. The excess and decadence at Dupont College are seen through the eyes of his heroine, Charlotte Simmons, who arrives a diligent virgin from the hills of North Carolina, on a full scholarship. She is initially intimidated and appalled, but eventually conquers her fear to partake, indeed to star, in the jock beanfeast. </p> <p>\"I personally would be shocked out of my pants if I was at college now,\" confides Wolfe, who spent four years trawling the campuses for raw material. The book, he says, is \"about sex as it interacts with social status. And I have tried to make the sex un-erotic. I will have failed if anyone gets the least bit excited. So much of modern sex is un-erotic, if erotic means flight of fancy or romantic build-up. Sex now is so easy to consummate - it is a pressure that affects everybody, girls more than boys, I think.\" </p> <p>As he notes, the America which votes tomorrow is a country riven over morality like never before. On the flip side of the culture of ubiquitous sex is that of puritan Christianity, as harnessed in no small part by Bush. \"Yes, there is this puritanism,\" says Wolfe, \"and I suppose we are talking here about what you might call the religious right. But I don't think these people are left or right, they are just religious, and if you are religious, you observe certain strictures on sexual activity - you are against the mainstream, morally speaking. And I do have sympathy with them, yes, though I am not religious. I am simply in awe of it all; the openness of sex. In the 60s they talked about a sexual revolution, but it has become a sexual carnival.\" </p> <p>No writer has chronicled the full American curve over four decades quite like Wolfe. He has been at this, unswervingly, since 1965, when he published a curio about pop culture called The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby. His breakthrough came in 1968 with The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test, his chronicle of Ken Kesey's LSD-gobbling Merry Pranksters. \"If I have been judged to be right wing,\" he says, \"I think this is because of the things I have mocked. It started with Radical Chic [published in 1970, about a fundraising party for the Black Panthers organised by Leonard Bernstein]. I was denounced because people thought I had jeopardised all progressive causes. But my impulse was not political, it was simply the absurdity of the occasion. Then I wrote The Painted Word, about modern art, and was denounced as reactionary. In fact, it is just a history, although a rather loaded one. Then came The Right Stuff [his account of America's first astronauts], after which my relative enthusiasm for Nasa was another sign of perfidy.\" </p> <p>He is \"proud\", he says, \"that I do not think any political motivation can be detected in my long books. My idol is Emile Zola. He was a man of the left, so people expected of him a kind of Les Miserables, in which the underdogs are always noble people. But he went out, and found a lot of ambitious, drunk, slothful and mean people out there. Zola simply could not - and was not interested in - telling a lie. You can call it honesty, or you can call it ego, but there it is. There is no motivation higher than being a good writer.\" </p> <p>In his manifesto of 1973 on The New Journalism, Wolfe advocated a \"journalistic or perhaps documentary novel\". He re-invoked the idea four years ago by way of retort to a fusillade of criticism - an exchange which scandalised New York society - levelled against his last novel, A Man In Full, from no less than Norman Mailer, John Updike and John Irving. The new book is in itself a counter to that outburst. </p> <p>Wolfe's lambent success in documenting ambition, drunkenness, sloth and meanness in his own country has taken him from his native Virginia to New York which he wrote about in Bonfire of the Vanities, pitching the super-rich \"Masters of the Universe\" in high finance against the real world of the Bronx. But even as the author of the quintessential New York novel, Wolfe feels estranged in the city, as he surveys America during the final days of the election campaign. Estranged not from the subjects of his scrutiny, the \"Masters of the Universe\", but rather from the liberal elite. </p> <p>\"Here is an example of the situation in America,\" he says: \"Tina Brown wrote in her column that she was at a dinner where a group of media heavyweights were discussing, during dessert, what they could do to stop Bush. Then a waiter announces that he is from the suburbs, and will vote for Bush. And ... Tina's reaction is: 'How can we persuade these people not to vote for Bush?' I draw the opposite lesson: that Tina and her circle in the media do not have a clue about the rest of the United States. You are considered twisted and retarded if you support Bush in this election. I have never come across a candidate who is so reviled. Reagan was sniggered it, but this is personal, real hatred. </p> <p>\"Indeed, I was at a similar dinner, listening to the same conversation, and said: 'If all else fails, you can vote for Bush.' People looked at me as if I had just said: 'Oh, I forgot to tell you, I am a child molester.' I would vote for Bush if for no other reason than to be at the airport waving off all the people who say they are going to London if he wins again. Someone has got to stay behind.\" </p> <p>Where does it come from, this endorsement of the most conservative administration within living memory? Of this president who champions the right and the rich, who has taken America into the mire of war, and seeks re-election tomorrow? Wolfe's eyes resume the expression of detached Southern elegance. </p> <p>\"I think support for Bush is about not wanting to be led by East-coast pretensions. It is about not wanting to be led by people who are forever trying to force their twisted sense of morality onto us, which is a non-morality. That is constantly done, and there is real resentment. Support for Bush is about resentment in the so-called 'red states' - a confusing term to Guardian readers, I agree - which here means, literally, middle America. I come from one of those states myself, Virginia. It's the same resentment, indeed, as that against your own newspaper when it sent emails targeting individuals in an American county.\" Wolfe laughs as he chastises. \"No one cares to have outsiders or foreigners butting into their affairs. I'm sure that even many of those Iraqis who were cheering the fall of Saddam now object to our being there. As I said, I do not think the excursion is going well.\" </p> <p>And John Kerry? \"He is a man no one should worry about, because he has no beliefs at all. He is not going to introduce some manic radical plan, because he is poll-driven, and it is therefore impossible to know where or for what he stands.\" </p> <p>As far as Wolfe is concerned, \"the great changes in America came with the second world war, since which time I have not seen much shift in what Americans fundamentally believe. Apart from the fact that as recently as the 1970s, Nelson Rockefeller shocked people by leaving his wife of 30 years, while now celebrities routinely have children outside marriage, the mayor of New York leaves his wife for his lover and no one blinks. But a large number of people have remained religious, and it is a divided country - do not forget that Al Gore nearly won the last election. The country is split right along party lines.\" </p> <p>And there has been a complete climate change in the nation which elected Bill Clinton twice, to that which may confer the same honour on George Bush tomorrow. This, says Wolfe, began not with the election of Bush, but on the morning of September 11 2001. </p> <p>None of us who were in New York that day will ever forget it, and Wolfe is no exception. \"I was sitting in my office when someone called to tell me two light planes had collided with the World Trade Centre. I turned on my television, before long there was this procession of people of all kinds, walking up the street. What I remember most was the silence of that crowd; there was no sound. </p> <p>\"That day told us that here was a different kind of enemy. I honestly think that America and the Bush administration felt that something extreme had to be done. But I do not think that the Americans have become a warlike people; it is rare in American history to set about empire-building - acquiring territory and slaves. I've never met an American who wanted to build an empire. And while the invasion of Afghanistan was something that had to be done, I am stunned that Iraq was invaded.\" </p> <p>Wolfe is by no means afraid to offend the political right - \"I'm gratified if you find me to be hard on them too,\" he says. He also anticipates that \"conservatives will not like this new novel because I refuse to take the impact of political correctness seriously - I think PC has probably had a good effect because it is now bad manners to use racial epithets.\" </p> <p>So what is it about his liberal neighbours and fellow diners in his adoptive New York that Wolfe cannot abide? \"I cannot stand the lock-step among everyone in my particular world. They all do the same thing, without variation. It gets so boring. There is something in me that particularly wants it registered that I am not one of them.\" </p> <p>Parting cordially, it seems strange that such an effervescent maverick, such a jester at the court of all power - all vanity, indeed - should so wholeheartedly endorse the power machine behind George Bush. And so an obvious thought occurs: perhaps Wolfe is jester at the court of New York too. Would he really be happier away from New York, out on the plains, in the \"red states\" where everyone at dinner parties votes for Bush? Wolfe's eyes revert to that mischievous glint, and he allows himself a smile. \"I do think,\" he admits, apparently speaking for himself, his country and his president, \"that if you are not having a fight with somebody, then you are not sure whether you are alive when you wake up in the morning.\"</p>",
  "Michael Moore, not content that both Fahrenheit 9/11 and his bestselling books are getting his anti-Bush message across, is undertaking a barnstorming campaign tour of 60 cities in 30 days. <p>The filmmaker and author arrived at Kent State university in Kent, Ohio, brimming with \"passionate optimism\" that John Kerry would defeat George Bush on November 2. He said he was working flat out to \"encourage those who do not usually vote to vote for John Kerry\".</p> <p>\"John Kerry will stand up for the working person in America. He will see that America is a force for peace in the world, not a force for war,\" Mr Moore told 6,000 cheering supporters in the university's gymnasium. </p> <p>\"Kerry is for peace and social justice, and that is why I am spending every waking moment of every day between now and the election to convince Americans to get out and vote.\"</p> <p>Mr Moore fired up the young crowd with a potent combination of satire, humour, invective and righteous anger. He told the Guardian Unlimited that his visit to Kent was especially meaningful because of the killings of four students who were protesting against the Vietnam war in 1970. </p> <p>\"Kent State holds a pivotal place in my generation because of that tragedy. I came here on the fifth anniversary of the shootings, and again on the tenth anniversary, to commemorate those who died here,\" he said. \"I will never forget that, and will continue to stand up for them and everyone who supports peace and free speech in our country.\"</p> <p>Mr Moore's gruelling tour is taking him to 20 states in the month before the election - including all the crucial swing states - but it has taken its toll. Two weeks ago, he came down with pneumonia, but continued the tour. </p> <p>\"I am trying to reach the people who usually don't vote - the working class, the single mothers, minorities and young people,\" he told the crowd. </p> <p>\"The rich all vote, and most of them vote Republican. Those who struggle often do not vote, but they support the Democratic candidates. If there is a huge turnout, then Bush will lose. That is why it is so important for everyone to vote. The Republicans have done the maths - and they are scared.\"</p> <p>Controversy has followed Mr Moore on his tour. Two universities, in California and Virginia, cancelled his engagements at the last minute. In both cases, he responded by booking new venues - and drew even bigger crowds. </p> <p>In Ohio, the Elyria public library cancelled a showing of Fahrenheit 9/11 after a lawsuit was filed by a conservative supporter of Mr Bush.</p> <p>\"It is a shame that library cancelled the movie, because people wanted to see it. They pulled the movie just because of one right wing kook,\" Mr Moore said. \"This is a rough time in this country for free expression.\"</p> <p>Mr Moore also lambasted the US press, saying: \"The mainstream press in the US has been in bed with Bush. What if they had done their job before the war and asked the questions to demand the evidence against Iraq? </p> <p>\"I wonder how many of those 1,100 dead American soldiers would be alive today? I wonder how many of the thousands of dead Iraqi civilians would be alive today? It is the responsibility of the press to go in like a bulldog and question those in power and then to come out and tell us the truth. They did not do that before the war.\"</p> <p>Mr Moore rallied the crowd - largely made up of university students - urging them to vote. \"This race is very, very close, and a great deal is at stake for our country and for the entire world,\" he said. </p> <p>\"We must all vote. Ohio is a vital state that could go either way. When the votes are being counted, I do not want to see Ohio blinking on the map as undecided, the way Florida was in the last election,\" he said. \"Get out and vote!\"</p>",
  "<p>A California man is providing free downloads of Fahrenheit 9/11 ahead of tomorrow's US presidential election, in a homespun effort to mobilise the anti-Bush vote. </p> <p>Marc Perkel, of San Bruno, California, spent $2,000 (\u00a31,090) on a high-speed internet connection that allows visitors to his <a href=\"http://marc.perkel.com\">website</a> easy access to Michael Moore's award-winning documentary. </p> <p>To date, it is estimated that the film has been downloaded some 338,000 times. \"But I don't count downloads, I count votes,\" Perkel has explained to the Independent newspaper. </p> <p>\"How many voters are converted or how many are motivated to vote ... I am trying to prevent world war three and possibly the end of civilisation as we know it.\"</p> <p>Perkel insists that Moore would have no objection to the illegal downloads, although he admits that he not personally asked the film-maker's permission.</p> <p>Earlier this year, Moore argued that the most important thing was for Fahrenheit 9/11 to be seen. \"I don't agree with the copyright laws and I don't have a problem with downloading the movie and sharing it with people,\" he said.</p>",
  "Welcome to the Wrap, Guardian Unlimited's round-up of the bets of the day's papers. <p><b>WILL BIN LADEN HELP BUSH?</b></p> <p>The polls open tomorrow. And as Donald Rumsfeld might put it, there are plenty of known unknowns washing around in today's papers - chief among them the question: \"Will Osama help Bush?\"</p> <p>\"The Bushies' campaign pitch follows their usual backward logic,\" writes Maureen Dowd in the Herald Tribune. \"Because we have failed to make you safer, you should re-elect us to make you safer. Because we haven't caught Osama in three years, you need us to catch Osama in the next four years. Because we didn't bother to secure explosives in Iraq, you can count on us to make sure those explosives aren't used against you ... It's absurd that America is mired in Iraq ... while the 9/11 mastermind nonchalantly pops up any time he wants.\"</p> <p>In the Bush corner, David Brooks: \"One felt all the old emotions. Who does he think he is, and who does he think we are? One of the crucial issues of this election is: which candidate fundamentally gets the evil represented by this man? Which of these two guys understands it deep in his gut? ... It's quite clear from the polls that most Americans fundamentally think Bush does get this ... We are revealed by what we hate. When it comes to Osama bin Laden, Kerry hasn't revealed whatever it is that lies inside.\"</p> <p>The Bin Laden tape was \"kryptonite for both sides\", the Guardian quotes a White House aide as saying.</p> <p>No one is sure, either, what Bin Laden wanted to achieve with his intervention. \"Some were convinced that he wanted four more years of Mr Bush, others that he wanted Mr Kerry to be elected,\" reports the paper.</p> <p>But no one can do more than speculate about the effect on the election. Karl Rove, George Bush's aide, feels \"very good\" - but then he would, wouldn't he? (The Independent reports theories that he engineered the release of the Bin Laden tape.) The Telegraph tells readers that the president \"must be allowed to finish the war on terror\". William Rees-Mogg assures Times readers that he will win - but the next four years will not be easy. Meanwhile, Mr Bush himself appeared to identify a new addition to the axis of evil, telling Floridians that Cuba should be freed from the ailing Fidel Castro's grip, and 63 people were killed over the weekend in Iraq.</p> <p>The Times calls in Bill Bryson to leaven the mood. \"The most unnerving fact of all is that some 5% of voters make their minds up on election day itself,\" he writes. \"They just see how they feel when they get out of bed in the morning. It is these decisive souls who will determine who leads the free world for the next four years.\"</p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uselections2004/story/0,13918,1340697,00.html\">Who speaks for America?</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uselections2004/story/0,13918,1340616,00.html\">Result remains poised on a razor's edge</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2004/10/31/opinion/eddowd.html\">IHT: Maureen Dowd</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2004/10/31/opinion/edbrooks.html\">IHT: David Brooks</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,482-1338819,00.html\">Times: William Rees-Mogg</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/section/0,,7,00.html\">Times: Bill Bryson</a><br> * <a href=\"http://news.independent.co.uk/world/americas/story.jsp?story=578096\">Independent: Cubans should be freed, Bush tells Florida</a><br> * <a href=\"http://news.independent.co.uk/world/americas/story.jsp?story=578090\">Independent: Bin Laden video inspires Rove conspiracy theories</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2004/11/01/dl0101.xml&amp;sSheet=/opinion/2004/11/01/ixopinion.html\">Telegraph: Bush must be allowed to finish the war on terror</a></p> <p><b>NO CLEAR WINNER IN UKRAINE ELECTION</b></p> <p>And so to Ukraine - where yesterday \"there appeared to be no clear winner in the contentious presidential election\", reports the Herald Tribune.

  "Osama bin Laden's features, courtesy of al-Jazeera, came as an unwelcome and eery surprise when they burst into the final, cliff-hanging days of the US election campaign last Friday. The al-Qaida leader's message to Americans was that the \"best way to avoid another Manhattan\" was to stop threatening the security of Muslims. Happily, he did not advise them which of the presidential candidates was likely to do that. And, bizarrely, he taunted George Bush for not acting quickly enough to save the thousands trapped in New York's twin towers on September 11 2001. Some nerve, as he also took clear responsibility for this act of mass murder. Overall, though, the style was more elder statesman than military commander: flowing robe, no camouflage gear or Kalashnikov rifle. And the backdrop was a studio, not an Afghan hillside. The world's most wanted man, sitting behind a desk, looked alarmingly healthy and calm, almost presidential. <p>The main impact of the 14-minute videotape was indeed to prove that he is still alive, or was until recently. It could either remind voters of Mr Bush's leadership in the \"war on terror\", or of his failure to capture the man synonymous with that war. Perhaps, some speculate, Bin Laden has managed to see - and be inspired by - Michael Moore's film, Fahrenheit 9/11, with its footage of Mr Bush's slow performance on the day. The president argued recently that it was of little importance whether Bin Laden was alive or dead. It may be that al-Qaida is now, and perhaps always was, more a state of mind than an organisation. Killing or capturing its leader would not end Jihadist terrorism, fuelled by causes from Chechnya to Indonesia. But you can be sure Mr Bush would flaunt such a great triumph if he could pull it off. </p> <p>The candidates only managed briefly to refrain from squabbling about the tape. But Richard Holbrooke, tipped as secretary of state in a Kerry administration, was justified in asking: \"How can this grotesque mass murderer be out there on worldwide television more than three years after 9/11?\" Mr Kerry protested that the president had \"outsourced\" the attack on Bin Laden's hideout at Tora Bora to Afghan warlords. </p> <p>Whoever wins tomorrow's election, the shadow of Bin Laden will hang heavily over the next US administration. Defeating terrorism will require a far deeper understanding of its root causes, reaching out to Muslims, focused, thoughtful action, better intelligence and the support of other countries alarmed by the abuses at Guantanamo Bay and Abu Ghraib - and who think that the Iraqi quagmire is a dangerous distraction from the real business at hand. </p> <p>Bin Laden's sinister reappearance contains lessons too for America's estranged European allies, who may be running the risk of exaggerated expectations of Mr Kerry's ability to heal transatlantic wounds. Many will have noticed Bin Laden's comment - surely no casual aside - that the idea of attacking tall buildings was inspired by Israeli air raids on Lebanon in 1982 - when a previous US administration gave the green light for another disastrous war. All remember the renegade Saudi's cynical offer of a \"ceasefire\" after the Madrid atrocity in March, when Spanish voters threw out the pro-war prime minister Jose Maria Aznar straight after the cruel mass bombings of the city's commuter trains. </p> <p>Perhaps there is a danger of reading too much into these manipulative messages: some suggest this one was a coded signal for terrorist action - though the US authorities insisted there was no intelligence about any immediate threat. Let there be no mistake: Bin Laden and his followers are a danger to us all, not just Americans. Murderous fanaticism does not become any more acceptable just because it is expressed in a twisted parody of an Oval Office address.</p>",
  "The videotape that was to prove Osama bin Laden was alive, apparently well and in combative mood, first surfaced on a doorstep in the plush neighbourhood under the Margalla hills, on the edge of Pakistan's capital, it was claimed yesterday. <p>A few streets away from the house in Islamabad of the disgraced nuclear scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan, an unknown hand dropped the al-Qaida leader's latest message at the door of the television network al-Jazeera. </p> <p>\"When I opened it, I knew it was a great scoop,\" said Ahmad Muaffaq Zaidan, the Pakistan bureau chief of al-Jazeera. </p> <p>Yesterday, Newsweek magazine was also reporting on the Bin Laden trail, quoting US officials saying that \"just a few weeks ago\" the net had been closing on an al-Qaida operative in Pakistan who might lead them to Bin Laden. \"It looked like we were really close, maybe one or two people away. There was a lot of optimism around here,\" one official said. </p> <p>Mr Zaidan had met Bin Laden twice before September 11 and had also received an audiotape from him in 2002. But such drop-offs are now a touchy subject, reflecting Pakistani sensitivity over reports that Bin Laden is hiding in the country's lawless border areas. </p> <p>The information minister, Sheikh Rashid Ahmed, told the Guardian yesterday that the tape drop story was a \"joke\". He said: \"It's garbage to suggest that someone could have just dropped the tape there. These days it's not possible for a guard to just take a package without knowing what it is.\" </p> <p>Confirmation that Bin Laden, despite some speculation, is alive, and still gunning for US targets, has set alarm bells ringing in Islamabad as well as in Washington. Pakistan has gradually displaced Afghanistan as the focus of the war on al-Qaida. Two assassination attempts in December on Pakistan's president, Pervez Musharraf, confirmed that Islamic militants had turned their sights on his US-allied government. Since then President Musharraf has taken the war back to them, offering generous bounties for al-Qaida related militants and ordering police searches in parts of cities such as Karachi and Lahore. </p> <p>His security forces scored coups such as the arrest of the al-Qaida computer expert Muhammad Naeem Noor Khan, and the gunning down of Amjad Hussain Farooqi, a key al-Qaida suspect. </p> <p>But the greatest activity has focused on the lawless northern borders where Bin Laden could still be hiding out. Thousands of Pakistani troops have been deployed to the tribal areas where they have carried out bloody assaults on suspected al-Qaida hideouts. More than 270 militants - many of them Uzbek, Chechen or Arab - have been killed. A high price has been paid: more than 170 deaths among the police and army, civilians caught in cross fire, and a dangerous escalation in local tribal tensions. And still, the biggest catch of all remains on the run. </p> <p>\"We are looking desperately [for Bin Laden]. We want him. There are so many people and so many agencies searching,\" said Mr Rashid. </p> <p>British special forces and MI6 have joined the hunt on the Afghan side of the border just as, more recently, they have been trying to locate in Iraq the Jordanian militant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, a professed al-Qaida disciple. </p> <p>But there is little proof that any of the armies tracking Bin Laden are even looking in the right place for him. Ever since his trail evaporated in the caves of Tora Bora in late 2001 there have been few specific leads. </p> <p>A flurry of Pakistani offensives in restive South Waziristan, on the Afghan border, were mounted against foreign fighters but not specifically for the hunt for Bin Laden. \"He could even be in Iran for all we know,\" said one observer in Islamabad. </p> <p>Friday's tape offers some of the strongest clues for months. The Islamabad drop suggests that he may be in the region, and a senior British anti- terrorist official described the tape itself as a \"vital piece of evidence\". </p> <p>In common with the CIA, British intelligence and security agencies are closely studying the full video for any clues it may give - not so much about Bin Laden's whereabouts but about his intentions. </p> <p>British officials are struck by Bin Laden's reference to the Israeli bombing of tower blocks in Lebanon in 1982. He claimed, almost certainly wrongly since it is believed the plan was only put to him in the mid-1990s, that the Israeli bombing inspired the attacks on the World Trade Centre in New York. </p> <p>However, the reference is assumed to be an attempt by Bin Laden to garner support among Palestinians and Shias. British intelligence and anti-terrorist officials have in the past made much of Bin Laden's apparent lack of interest in the Palestinian cause as well as the Palestinians' resistance to his message. </p> <p>And if anything, the latest video has scotched months of conspiratorial rumours that the US forces would pull off the capture of Bin Laden just before this week's presidential election in the US. </p> <p>\"If we knew exactly where he was,\" Major Scott Nelson, a US army spokesman, told reporters recently, \"we would have a very happy day and a happy election.\"</p>",
  "<p><br>The Washington Redskins: will they predict the outcome of the US election this time? <br>Photograph: Doug Pensinger/Getty Images Sport</p> <p>If John Kerry loses the election on Tuesday, it won't be for want of good sport omens. First, his home team, the Boston Red Sox, trounced the St Louis Cardinals in four straight games to take their <a href=\"http://boston.redsox.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/index.jsp?c_id=bos\">first World Series victory since 1918</a>. </p> <p>Now the <a href=\"http://www.redskins.com/\">Washington Redskins</a> have come to his rescue by losing a football game. Here's how it works: the Washington Redskins have correctly predicted the presidency in every election since 1936 (Franklin Delano Roosevelt, since you ask). If they win their last home game before the election, the incumbent wins. Unfortunately for George Bush, they blew it, losing 28\u201314 to the <a href=\"http://www.packers.com/\">Green Bay Packers</a> on Sunday.</p> <p>Just to nail home the theory, the Redskins' career as kingmakers began after the team was renamed in 1933. They used to be known as the Braves, and they were from \u2026 Boston. </p> <p>If that omen doesn't suit, though, I have another. Halloween mask sales have predicted the presidency for the last six elections, according to <a href=\"http://www.buycostumes.com\">Buycostumes.com</a>, a non-partisan costume sales site. Bush masks outsold Kerry masks by <a href=\"http://www.buycostumes.com/presidentialmask.aspx\">53% to 47%</a> this year. This is a particularly pernicious predictor, as many revellers no doubt bought the masks to make fun of the candidates, rather than to support them.</p>",
  "Tabare Vazquez was poised to become Uruguay's first leftwing president yesterday after campaigning for the more equitable distribution of wealth and social justice in a country crippled by a recent economic crisis. <p>Election exit polls gave the charismatic 64-year-old doctor between 50.9% and 53% of the vote, more than the 50% needed to win the first round and avoid a runoff.</p> <p>Pollsters Cifra and Factum said Mr Vazquez was the winner, but others did not rule out a runoff because of the margin of error in the polls.</p> <p>Mr Vazquez's Broad Front coalition, including socialists, communists, social democrats and a popular former guerrilla movement, was also heading for majorities in both houses of congress, the pollsters said.</p> <p>By electing Mr Vazquez, Uruguay will join Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Venezuela which have chosen leftwing leaders on platforms of poverty alleviation after a decade of US-backed free-market policies.</p> <p>On news of the Broad Front's lead, the main avenue of Montevideo erupted in celebration. Thousands waving the coalition's red, white and blue flags gathered at campaign headquarters.</p> <p>\"After so many years of anger, it's just pure happiness,\" said Luis Sancristobal, 29, as he sold flags.</p> <p>The Broad Front was founded 33 years ago as an alternative to the two traditional parties which have ruled Uruguay for 170 years, the Colorados and Blancos.</p> <p>Many voters blame them for mishandling the 1999 to 2003 economic crisis which spilled over from Argentina.</p> <p>Jorg\u00e9 Larranaga, of the centre-right Blanco party, was given between 29% and 34% of the vote in exit polls. Guillermo Stirling of the centrist ruling Colorado party trailed with between 8.4% and 13%.</p> <p>While promising change, Mr Vazquez has been careful to point out that only the very poorest are likely to benefit from social programmes at the outset of his five-year mandate because of lack of public funds.</p>",
  "Cherie Blair has mounted a fresh attack on the legality of some of the Bush administration's decisions by challenging the legal basis of the imprisonment of terrorist suspects at Guant\u00e1namo Bay. <p>Downing Street conceded yesterday that she did make the criticisms, in a lecture to law students at Harvard University, for which she was not paid. But it said her remarks should not be interpreted as political. </p> <p>In a previous lecture, she criticised the US administration's refusal to sign up to the international criminal court. </p> <p>Downing Street said Mrs Blair's latest remarks should be read in the context of her role as a human rights lawyer, not as the wife of the prime minister. </p> <p>But the Tory chairman, Liam Fox, said that in the week before the US election she had \"put herself in a potentially embarrassing situation\". \"There are times when a prudent silence is wise,\" he said. </p> <p>Mrs Blair was reported to have criticised the arrest of a gay couple in Mr Bush's home state of Texas for defying a ban on sodomy, and said a supreme court ruling against the ban was \"a model of judicial reasoning\". </p> <p>The ban was backed by Mr Bush when he was state governor. </p> <p>She described the supreme court's decision to give legal protection to two Britons at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, as \"profoundly important\" and a \"significant victory for human rights and the international rule of law\". </p> <p>The court struck out President Bush's claim that foreign prisoners were not entitled to the protection of the courts and therefore had no right to challenge their detention. </p> <p>Her only reservation was that the court did not go further and give the detainees more international protection. </p> <p>Two British detainees, Asif Iqbal and Shafiq Rasul, were held at Camp X-ray. They were freed in March after being arrested in Afghanistan and held without charge for more than two years. </p> <p>They allege that heavy-handed treatment was systematic. </p> <p>A No 10 spokesman said: \"These were in no way political opinions. </p> <p>\"She is a high-profile international human rights lawyer and she was expressing a view about the use of the supreme court in the American justice system and used these as examples.\" </p> <p>Mrs Blair was last attacked from the left for her legal opinions by the former cabinet minister Clare Short. </p> <p>Ms Short claimed Mrs Blair had assured her that the war against Iraq was legal. </p> <p>She says in her autobiography: \"Cherie gave me a cup of tea and was very friendly but firmly assured me that Tony would not contemplate breaking international law. </p> <p>\"I was left with the impression that Cherie was involved in discussion of the issues and very supportive of Tony.\" </p> <p>Last November, at a human rights conference at Georgetown University in Washington, Mrs Blair defended the international criminal court. </p> <p>She said that although the court had \"flaws\", she was \"convinced the ICC with independent prosecutors putting tyrants and torturers in the dock before independent judges reflects the postwar human rights aspiration come true\". </p> <p>She said that \"the US appears unwilling to see there are various safeguards built into the statute which ensure that all states have nothing to fear from the court\".</p>",
  "Alan Milburn famously left the cabinet to spend more time with his family and now, back in the cabinet organising Labour's general election, his family is spending more time with him. <p>Sitting at the desk of his plush Cabinet Office rooms overlooking Horse Guards Parade is one of his sons on half-term, clicking through computer screens with the opaque sang-froid of the teenager. This is work-life balance in action. </p> <p>Mr Milburn, six weeks into his new job, appears to have got though his rocky re-entry when everything he said was read through the prism of an attack on the ousted Brownites. Indeed he makes a point of stressing that people from the Treasury are sitting on the newly key election committees. \"We are up and running and everyone has bought into it,\" he says. </p> <p>He even refers admiringly to the \"progressive consensus\", the aspiration set out for Labour by Gordon Brown in a major speech a fortnight ago. </p> <p>He acknowledges the media search for division \"will always happen. You're faced with a choice about this all the time. Do you not do an interview or make a speech because you're afraid of the headline? But you cannot get yourself into that position.\" His big message is that Labour now has an election machine and battle plan, different from the two previous elections, and it will strive to inspire, not just scrape home into a third term. </p> <p>\"All the time, events swish around you, but you have to have a plan and stick to it,\" he says. \"Our plan is first set out the record and achievement, emphasise the pride in Britain, and that Britain is working; secondly make a strong 'future offer' that reconnects and reassembles the New Labour coalition. Lastly, set out the dividing lines with our political opponents so that the next election becomes a choice for the country, not a referendum on this government .\" </p> <p>He vows: \"Our contention is not somehow just to coast it. We are going to take on our opponents, we are going to fight every seat we currently hold in order to win them all.\" </p> <p>His buoyancy stems from recent polls showing Labour well ahead of the Conservatives, despite Iraq and plunging trust in the prime minister. The party's private poll gives Labour a six-point lead. </p> <p>He senses the public are still \"with Labour\", but in need of re-persuasion. </p> <p>\"People are basically with us in spirit, but they want to be absolutely convinced that the issues and concerns that affect their lives are those that affect our lives and are the ones we are going to deal with.\" He lists the critical issues as crime, pensions, childcare, choice, equal pay and social mobility. </p> <p>\"The trick between now and the election is to narrow the gap between those who identify with Labour and those who say they intend to vote Labour.\" The trick also requires trumpeting Labour's record without tottering over into hubris, or else Labour will lose what he describes as \"the permission to persuade\". </p> <p>\"The big fundamental problems the country faced have been addressed,\" he claims. \"Mass unemployment has been replaced with full employment, cuts in public services with investment; a boom and bust economy has been replaced by a stable economy. Finally, there has been a decent constitutional settlement for the country. </p> <p>\"The country is probably in a more optimistic mood than many of us give it credit for. We almost have to make Labour the patriotic party.\" </p> <p>At the same time, there has to be renewal. \"After seven years issues go wrong, issues come up, things don't happen, people have disagreements with one another, so you have to reignite the energy.\" </p> <p>He denies Labour is liable to be crushed by a pincer movement of liberals alienated by Iraq, and working class voters disillusioned by crime and asylum. Nevertheless, he accepts the government may be a hostage to events in Iraq. He says: \"We have got a plan. Elections happen in January and that will produce a more stable Iraq. It is an enormously difficult and divisive issue, but I do not think the 'troops out' position is either realistic or right.\" </p> <p>\"Both [Charles] Kennedy and [Michael] Howard have made a big error of judgment on this. They might think it might reap a harvest in the short term, but come an election, people will start to ask whether they can be trusted with running the country. </p> <p>\"The Tories,\" he asserts, \"are in a lot of trouble. They must have hoped for a far bigger post-conference bounce in the polls than they got. The strategic mistake is worrying more about their right flank than their centre flank. It's very difficult for them when New Labour has taken so much of their centre ground, but, as both [Chris] Patten and [Michael] Portillo have argued in recent weeks, politics in the end is won, not on the extremes, but in the centre.\" </p> <p>Their overall strategy, symbolised by the appointment of the Australian Lynton Crosby as campaign director, will be \"to peddle pessimism and undermine confidence. We have got to expose that.\" </p> <p>But he seems equally determined to assault the Liberals, explaining he has brought in the campaigning MPs Fraser Kemp and Tom Watson \"to take them on, rather than just letting them come at you. We have got to be on the front foot, not on the back foot\". </p> <p>As the Liberal Democrats progress, so the bar of scrutiny is also raised, he says. </p> <p>He promises to take seriously those \"who are traditional left leaning, liberally inclined and contemplating voting for Charles Kennedy\". He intends to point out that the \"Orange Book liberals\", such as Mark Oaten, represent \"a new generation formulating policies that are more Tory than the Tories\". </p> <p>But this does not mean he will backtrack on the party's commitment to choice and market mechanisms in public services. </p> <p>\"Choice is one thing that has always been limited to some people - getting on the housing ladder, having fulfilling employment, getting a decent education and being able to progress in your life. </p> <p>\"I am obsessive that the opportunities I had in my own life are available to other people. We don't do this to pander to consumerism, but because it means spreading opportunity and social mobility,\" something he admits that has declined over the last 20 years. </p> <p>\"We favour reform not as some form of anodyne, value-free process; it is reform for a purpose and that is to expand opportunities. </p> <p>\"In London, if you have got enough money, you either buy your child out of the education system, or you move home in order to locate to a decent school. That is what happens. The way through that is raise standards through city academies and specialist schools. It takes time, effort and resources, but that is what we intend to have.\" </p> <p><b>The CV</b></p> <p><b>Alan Milburn</b> </p> <p><b>Born:</b> January 27 1958 </p> <p><b>Family:</b> Partner, Dr Ruth Briel; two sons </p> <p><b>Education:</b> Stokesley comprehensive school and Lancaster University </p> <p><b>Background:</b> Trade union researcher; business development officer, North Tyneside council </p> <p><b>Political career:</b> MP for Darlington since 1992; opposition health spokesman 1995-96; Treasury spokesman 1996-97; junior health minister 1997-98; chief secretary to the Treasury 1998-99; health secretary 1999-2003; resigned to spend time with family 2003; Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Labour's election coordinator 2004-</p>",
  "Labour is in the advance stages of planning its campaign to win a record third term in power, the party's election coordinator admitted yesterday - but he insisted reports of a snap February election were \"rubbish\". <p>In an interview with the Guardian, Alan Milburn said: \"We are very well advanced, but it is rubbish to suggest we have set February as the date for the election.\" The most likely date remains May, officials indicated. </p> <p>Mr Milburn promised a quite different campaign from Labour's previous two campaigns, which resulted in landslide wins. \"In 1997 we won by attacking the Conservatives and making ourselves safe and electable,\" he said. \"In '01 we fought an absolutely right campaign and got an absolutely right result. Our central message was 'we have been in for four years, now give us a bit more time'. </p> <p>\"After eight or nine years we need quite a different campaign.\" </p> <p>Labour headquarters has already hired 80 full-time regional organisers and 120 tele phone canvassing and mailshot staff at its northern base in Gosforth, well ahead of its planning at an equivalent stage in the run-up to the 2001 election. </p> <p>Mr Milburn said he believed the next general election campaign would be \"as much fought locally as it is nationally. Messages about the record of national achievement tend to mean less than what is happening in Darlington, Derby or Dartford.\" Promising to defend every Labour seat, including ones that the party never expected to win in 1997, he said: \"We are in a far better state at this stage of the electoral cycle than previous Labour governments have ever been.\" </p> <p>But he warned: \"What we cannot allow is for this next election to turn into some form of referendum purely on the government's performance.\" Conceding the government needed to do more to win over wary voters who were still with Labour \"in spirit\", he said most voters recognised that the government had to see the job through in Iraq. </p> <p>In a sign of Labour's growing uneasiness about the impact the Liberal Democrats could make, Mr Milburn claimed some of the party's MPs were \"more Tory than the Tories\". </p> <p>Warning that the \"the bar is rising for Charles Kennedy's party\", he claimed: \"Once they are subject to scrutiny and test, and, once we take the battle to them, as the Hartlepool byelection proved, at that point they start to crumble.\"</p>",
  "<p>So the curse of the Bambino is ended; Harry Frazee, the man who sold Babe Ruth to the New York Yankees so he could fund a musical that fateful day in 1919, can rattle his bones in peace. For the first time since September 11 1918 the Boston Red Sox are World Series champions after a clean sweep of the St Louis Cardinals. The Red Sox dug-out erupted, the players did gymnastics of delight and a lot of people, wherever they watched, wound their way home very, very happy. </p> <p>\"There have been so many people in their 90s who said: 'I just want to live long enough to see one championship before I die,'\" said the Sox chairman Tom Werner. \"This is for them.\" </p> <p>But were Grandmother and Grandfather Red Sox still ecstatic on Thursday morning as they looked out into the red-and-gold New England autumn or did they hesitate, remembering that their reason for living - or at least for moping and hoping - had disappeared. Eighty-six years of hurt gone, just like that. </p> <p>The Red Sox had been the chokers, the losers, the laughing stock of baseball. They had won five of the first 15 World Series titles but, since 1918, not a bean. They suffered chants of \"1918\" every time they played the Yankees and their canon of near misses became American sporting folklore. </p> <p>Businesses were raking it in with \"Reverse the curse\" memorabilia including an ice cream with hot fudge, caramel-covered bases and chocolate-covered peanut balls. And, according to one report, a hacked-off local radio star Eddie Andelman, a loyal Boston fan all his life, had had his tombstone prepared with the words \"Eddie Andelman - They Never Won It In His Lifetime\" (The Red Sox typically waited until the poor man was away before they pulled the rabbit out of the hat; Andelman was attending his son's wedding). </p> <p>Of course life will go on for the loyal fan - with the bonus of being able to buy a souvenir T-shirt, name a new baby after the entire team, read the back catalogue of the fan Stephen King and cast a presidential vote for the Red Sox cap-wearing John Kerry. But, come the new season, can he or she really bear to swash down soda watching a team fulfilled? Cope with an entirely new emotion and expectation? And experience the sudden delight which fans of other teams will share when the Red Sox get their first bloody nose of the season. As those at Highbury could warn them, no one likes a smart-arse, however cute the legend or cerebral the manager. </p> <p>There is a certain down-on-your-luck comradeship that comes from supporting a team on a losing streak, the longer, the more heartbreaking, the better. It is the same doggedness in adversity that affects those who still insist on buying and selling carrots in pounds and ounces. People like to get knee-deep and wallow in the pointlessness of it all. A win throws everything out of kilter. </p> <p>Of course not everyone loves a loser. The West Indies cricket team were never so well supported as when they were terrorising the world with their rotation of four long-limbed and brain-crushingly fast bowlers. When they started losing, many turned to basketball, football or even baseball (although not the Red Sox presumably.) And the famed British love of the underdog did not do Manchester United any harm after they ended a 26-year wait for the league title by winning the first Premiership in 1993. Similarly in the last two weeks, Leeds Rhinos - rugby league's best-known chokers - have reported that winning the Super League grand final to secure their first championship since 1972 has led to a surge of interest in the club. </p> <p>But what is there left for disaffected Red Sox fans who really cannot rise to the challenge of supporting a winning team? They will not find any succour in going out to Foxborough to watch the New England Patriots, the Super Bowl champions. </p> <p>They could head down the interstate and transfer their affections to the Chicago White Sox, without the American League title for 87 years, or move across town to the Chicago Cubs, who last won the World Series in 1908. </p> <p>Or they could look across the pond to baseball's English cousin and start supporting a suitable county cricket club. Northamptonshire should be a safe bet.</p>",
  "<p>The Slash U ranch near Tucson, Arizona, 4am on a grim Wednesday. It's dark, there's a 30mph wind and cold, heavy rain. The yard outside the ranch house is filled with barking dogs and horses watch over fences as a TV news crew assemble their gear. Having rejected a windswept field as a possible site for their report, the five-man team from Sky have settled on a barn. This is partly to protect their kit from the rain but also because the tackroom is straight out of Bonanza, loaded with cowboy saddles, reins, crops and horse feed and the rancher is wearing a stetson. </p> <p>The team are exhausted. They've been up since 2.30am, having got to bed at 11pm the night before. Now they're about to go live into London's lunchtime news bulletin. Stumbling through the gloom and biting rain, they've somehow managed to rig a bank of glaring lights that penetrate the pre-dawn shadows. Behind it they've set up a futuristic wi-fi base unit to handle a feed from a digi-cam. Outside, in the satellite van, Dan Williams, Sky's Washington news editor, is watching anxiously on a monitor as US correspondent Andrew Wilson mounts one of the rancher's horses ready to deliver his piece to camera. The disembodied voice from London says they'll be coming to Dan in five minutes, at which point there's a tiny flicker and all the power in the barn snaps off leaving everything in pitch black. </p> <p>Williams would be forgiven if he started to cry. Instead, with an almost chillingly inhuman calm, he sets about fixing the power as the seconds tick away. Engineers and cameramen blunder through the wet, re-rigging and e-plugging as the feed from London counts down remorselessly. Finally, with less than 60 seconds to go, the lights flash back on, Wilson tugs on the horse's reins and they're live to London just as if they'd been cued up for an hour. </p> <p>Here's why the crew are huddled in the Arizona downpour. The US presidential election is the biggest news story in the world. It comes at a time when news is more instantly available and minutely examined than at any other time in human history. Every news channel, every national broadcaster with a reasonable news operation and every big newspaper in the world needs to cover Bush v Kerry, as well as the bloggers like Daily Kos who are now getting accreditation. This leads to some incredible numbers. </p> <p>The BBC has 200 people dedicated to covering the election, including engineering and technical staff, Sky News has about 50, with a similar presence from ITN's ITV, Channel 4 and Channel Five news teams, plus radio news and the national dailies, which brings the total UK media presence to almost 400 people. Spreading out across Europe, these numbers are replicated. There are four Russian television news operations with teams in the US; German, Spanish, Italian and French news channels, state and independent broadcasters as well as their print compatriots. Even Croatian state television has a presence. Then there's North Africa, Asia, Oceania - indeed, latest estimates put the number of foreign journalists covering the story at almost 8,000 people - roughly the equivalent of the UK's military presence in Iraq and probably better equipped. </p> <p>And yet it's not an easy gig. For one thing, the candidates treat the foreign media with contempt. During the 2000 election, a reporter from a German newspaper asked Karen Hughes, Bush's senior adviser, a question. Half way through her answer, something struck her. \"Who do you work for?\" she asked. \"A German newspaper,\" he began. \"Then what am I wasting my time talking to you for?\" she asked, somewhat rhetorically, and turned on her heel. One Kerry aide was equally specific. \"To us,\" he told the Washington Post last week, \"foreign media are about as useful as lice.\" </p> <p>As a result, when it comes to media access, rationing is extremely harsh. There are ten media places on Air Force One and Kerry's campaign plane and these go to the four US television networks - Fox, CBS, NBC, ABC - as well as CNN and the big daily newspapers (whose journalists are charmingly known as \"scribblers\"). These people form the \"gaggle\", the small group of hacks who get daily briefings from the campaign team, outlining the theme for the day at the various speeches the candidate plans to give. On October 27, for instance, the Kerry gaggle travelled with the senator as he visited Iowa, then Minnesota, back to Iowa and on to Ohio. They were pre-briefed that Kerry planned to pick up on the New York Times story about missing explosives in Iraq, managing to feed reports into every bulletin - even those that went out before a speech had been made. </p> <p>Following close behind each campaign jet are the press charters, two planes booked by the White House Press Club, who have to keep close tabs on what the plane in front is doing just in case a tight poll forces everyone to veer off to Florida. Foreign media can apply for a place on one of these charters, but it costs a couple of thousand dollars a day and that's a lot of money to pay to have the candidates ignore you. </p> <p>What's more galling to international superstar anchors is how important tiny local cable stations and newspapers suddenly become. The decision is going to be made in the handful of states that aren't already cast-iron Republican or Democrat loyalists. At the start of the final week, that meant ten states; Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania plus Colorado, Nevada, New Hampshire, Iowa, Minnesota, New Mexico and Wisconsin - although by Wednesday, previously pro-Gore Michigan started to look like a Bush target. The local media in those states suddenly achieve a status commensurate with that of CNN or NBC. Last week, for instance, some overseas broadcasters began talks to gain access to Carl Rove, the mastermind behind the Bush campaign. He blew them off for lunch with the chief reporter of the Ohio Sentinel. </p> <p> Newspapers can respond in different ways to this news drought. They could, for instance, propose a letter-writing campaign to an obscure county in Ohio. That might generate one or two column inches. For 24-hour news channels - whose viewers expect something on the election in every bulletin - this is a nightmare. Sky has decided to try something different. As well as two reporters leapfrogging the campaign trail, they've hired a private jet for Williams' team and sent them out into America to tap the mood of the population. Wilson will file three live reports a day from three different areas in five different states where election issues are felt at the sharp end in a series of packages known as Sky Across America. </p> <p>\"It's partly to sidestep the anti-foreign media bias and partly a bid to explain the campaign to the Brits,\" Williams explains. \"So far, we've been to logging camps and the wilderness in Oregon to look at environmental issues as well as a marine base and a vets' barbecue in South Carolina to cover the military vote. Arizona is right on the border with Mexico and they're turning back 600,000 illegal immigrants a year - with estimates that two out of three get through. Locals have reported Iranians coming over and fear al-Qaeda may smuggle themselves over the border.\" </p> <p>With 8,000 hacks roaming the nation looking for a story, of course, there's always the possibility of a crossover. Moving on from the border ranch, the team hooked up with a gang of Tombstone vigilantes who head out to well-known immigrant routes, armed to the teeth. These people seem unlikely media stars. For one thing, their activities are very close to illegal. For another, they show up in a 4x4 sporting the bumper sticker \"CNN Lies!\" Nonetheless, these citizens have already featured on two other news channels, one of them Russian. \"They had awfully heavy cameras,\" one vigilante recalls. \"We saw a bunch of illegals and chased 'em for four miles and those poor Russians were pretty tired out.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile on the stump, Sky's other US correspondents are covering the swing states, with Ian Woods tracking the candidates and, this week, Keith Graves focusing on Florida. On Monday, Woods was at Love Park in Pennsylvania for Bill Clinton's appearance alongside Kerry - a bizarre spectacle in a long, thin park packed with 80-90,000 ecstatic Democrats who only had a sideways view of their idol as the stage had been rotated 90 degrees to face the media. By Wednesday, as Williams and co pushed through the Arizona scrub with the gun totin' vigilantes, Woods was covering Bush in Youngstown, Ohio. \"We usually have a rough idea as to where the candidates are going about 72 hours in advance,\" he explains on the way to the commuter airport where the Bush team have booked a hangar for the rally. \"Then they give you the address with 24 hours' notice.\" </p> <p>He arrived at the airport at the same time as the Observer, a Dutch and a Belgian journalist. As they pulled up, the last of the Ohio media were trickling into the press entrance, at which point it was shut by the secret service, who told the Europeans to hoof it round the airport to the public entrance, a journey of four miles through gridlocked traffic. After two miles, they abandoned their cars and finished the journey on foot, Woods arriving in situ two minutes before going live. \"To be fair, even the local media thought the event was badly organised,\" he says wryly. </p> <p>The following day, Williams and Wilson are filming in a TV evangelist's studio, asking Dr Richard Roberts about the Christian vote. \"I have been preaching that we need to support a man of God who governs well,\" Roberts intones, whilst cynical London cameramen struggle to avoid blaspheming as they wire up their kit and drop things on their feet. \"And that man is Bush.\" The crew are slightly suspicious of Roberts when the studio manager takes them round the studio, showing off the digital editing suites. \"That set up would cost several million dollars,\" cameraman Martin whispers. \"Where's he getting the money?\" </p> <p>As the Sky jet lands in New York for the final day, filming NYPD commissioner Raymond Kelly at Ground Zero, Woods is covering the Kerry/Springsteen rally. This is a big one for the non-English speaking media, because they don't need to translate Springsteen's songs. Woods is swamped by Japanese camera crews, but the Yanks are late, allowing him to nick some transponder times from CBS and do a live set-up for the first time this week. </p> <p>The teams chat on Friday morning to plan the next few days. Monday sees Kerry and Bush both making seven separate visits, and New Jersey and Hawaii - previously Democrat safe states - suddenly look vulnerable. That could mean covering more than 6,000 miles in 24 hours. \"We're going to need another plane,\" says Williams, wistfully.</p>",
  "The three words that were on everyone's mind did not escape John Kerry's lips when the soaring notes of the gospel choir faded away and he rose before the congregation. <p>With just 48 hours to go before his fate is decided, and 40 hours after Osama bin Laden made his dramatic entrance into the American election campaign, the Democratic candidate was determined to return to the closing message of his campaign - his promise of better jobs, healthcare and education. </p> <p>And at Shiloh baptist church, where people fluttered fan-sized Kerry-Edwards signs in the pews, that was what people mostly wanted to hear from Mr Kerry: a commitment to the concerns of African-American voters. </p> <p>\"What are we doing, cutting overtime pay for people trying to work to take care of their families and their kids?\" Mr Kerry said, and the congregation umm-hmmed their approval. \"I am tired of being a country that is content to spend $50,000 a year to send a young person to prison for the rest of his life rather than invest $10,000 in Head Start [the US, pre-school, child development programme] and other federal education programmes.\" There was a smattering of applause. </p> <p>But while the Shiloh baptist church comes pretty close to being Mr Kerry's promised land - the pastor, Reverend Selwyn Bachus, describing the Bush administration as a \"nightmare\" - it was hard to banish entirely that mix of confusion, dread and anger that bubbled up as the US's most hated enemy resurfaced. </p> <p>Popular wisdom this weekend held that Bin Laden's reappearance on television was good news for George Bush, reaffirming his image as a resolute leader, a war-time president and safe pair of hands in an age of terror. </p> <p>But such predictions do not hold much sway over the congregation at Shiloh where the hostility towards President Bush runs so strong and deep almost nothing might persuade people to change their vote. </p> <p>\"The first thought that went through my mind was how come he pops up on TV and we can't find out where he is?\" said Alonzo Motley, the church deacon. \"I don't think that it is going to help Bush.\" </p> <p>That was among the more charitable views of Mr Bush. Among the pews, as among African-Americans countrywide, there is a conviction that Mr Bush rode to power by robbing black people in Florida of their votes, and an abiding sense that he has little empathy for minorities or the poor. </p> <p>\"I really don't know if I should be mad at Osama Bin Laden or mad at George Bush,\" said Elaine Harris, a church chorister, who lost a cousin in the September 11 attacks. \"I feel like the president and Bin Laden have some kind of tie.\" </p> <p>Aides for Mr Kerry said yesterday that he had no plans to make a big statement on Bin Laden during his campaign stops. They revealed early internal polls indicating that the Bin Laden video left the race unaltered with Mr Kerry at 48% and Mr Bush at 47%. However, the question in that poll was suggestive, asking respondents whether Bin Laden's resurfacing \"makes me think that George Bush took his eye off the ball in Afghanistan and diverted resources to Iraq\". </p> <p>The rationale behind the silence of their candidate was clear: Mr Kerry was not exposing himself to accusations that he was capitalising on the surprise appearance by America's most dreaded enemy. </p> <p>So far, Mr Kerry has restricted his comments to a well-worn campaign theme, saying Mr Bush neglected the hunt for al-Qaida's leader through obsession with Iraq. </p> <p>\"When Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida were cornered in the mountains of Tora Bora, it was wrong to outsource the job of capturing them to Afghan warlords,\" he told a rally in Wisconsin on Saturday. \"It was wrong to divert our forces from Afghanistan so we could rush to war with Iraq without a plan to win the peace.\" </p> <p>By yesterday Mr Kerry was the statesman again, preaching unity, telling ABC TV that he was dismayed that Democratic leaders had sought to extract political advantage from Bin Laden's appearance. \"I'm outraged that he has appeared; I'm outraged that he inserts himself in any kind of way into the electoral process of America,\" he said. </p> <p>Yesterday was the fifth time in as many weeks that Mr Kerry had chosen to spend his Sunday morning at an African-American church, to shore up the Democrats' most reliable voting block. </p> <p>Although Al Gore won more than 90% of the black vote in 2000, Mr Bush has siphoned support from Mr Kerry among the church-going African-Americans because of his opposition to gay marriage. </p> <p>That slippage is critical in Ohio: which is ground zero in this election campaign, one of the larger battleground states, having 20 electoral college votes. The contest was in a dead heat yesterday, with a poll in the Columbus Dispatch showing Mr Kerry and Mr Bush each hovering slightly below 50% support. </p> <p>In his church visits Mr Kerry is trying to show that he is as \"godly\" as Mr Bush. He told the congregation yesterday there was more to living a moral life than merely speaking about religion. \"Coming to church on Sunday, and talking about church just doesn't do it,\" he said. </p> <p>Neither apparently does talking about Bin Laden. </p> <p><b>Ohio</b></p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> The state, with 20 electoral college votes, has the seventh largest number of votes in the country </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> In the last century, only four candidates have won the election after losing Ohio </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> It is a battleground after Al Gore lost narrowly in 2000. Democrats believe it is fertile ground because the state has suffered so many job losses. Ohio has had a surge in voter mobilisation, with more than 600,000 newly registered voters</p>",
  "With just two days to the US presidential election, the jockeying for the 2008 Republican nomination stepped up a gear yesterday with an unexpected admission by Arnold Schwarzenegger that he would be interested in running. <p>On previous occasions the governor of California has sidestepped the question, but asked last night on the CBS programme 60 Minutes if he would support an amendment to allow a foreign-born national to be president, Mr Schwarzenegger said: \"Yes, absolutely.\" </p> <p>\"I think, you know, because why not? I mean, you know, anyone with my way of thinking, you always shoot for the top,\" he said. \"But it's not something that I am preoccupied with. I am not thinking one single minute about that because there's so many things I have to do in California, and my promise was to straighten out the mess in California.\" </p> <p>The Austrian-born former action hero's ambitions are not possible at present: under the constitution, a president has to have been born in the US. An amendment would allow anyone who has been a US citizen for 20 years to run. Mr Schwarzenegger became a citizen in 1983. </p> <p>His words come just two days after he appeared alongside George Bush in Columbus, Ohio. </p> <p>Mr Schwarzenegger's relations with the president are known to be cool, as was evident during the rally on Friday. The governor failed to attack John Kerry during his speech, and then sat with his hands folded during Mr Bush's speech, failing to applaud many of the more conservative, crowd-pleasing lines. </p> <p>The differences between the two stem in part from political ambitions, but also from genuine policy differences. Mr Schwarzenegger is mindful that he owes much of popularity to his ability to talk to both Republican and Democrat voters. His aides are concerned that if he is too closely aligned with Mr Bush, much of the governor's liberal support will be scared away. </p> <p>The two have very different priorities. Mr Schwarzenegger is married to Maria Shriver, a member of the Kennedy clan and active Democrat. Her influence is credited with moving Mr Schwarzenegger to more liberal positions than the president on issues such as gun control, abortion and stem cell research. That issue, brought to prominence by the recent death of Christopher Reeve, also flared up at the weekend as the actor and director Mel Gibson opposed Mr Schwarzenegger's endorsement of a Californian ballot proposition to authorise $3bn (\u00a31.63bn) into stem cell research. </p> <p>Gibson, one of the most powerful men in Hollywood after the success of his Christian traditionalist-inspired film The Passion of the Christ, said he had tried to call Mr Schwarzenegger to discuss the issue with him. \"He said, 'Well, I'm very busy now. I'll call you back. I've got to make a speech, you know. I'll call you right back.' Well, Arnold, I'm still waiting for your call,\" Gibson told ABC news. </p> <p>But Mr Schwarzenegger disputed Gibson's version of the conversation, saying that it was Gibson who had failed to return his call. \"I don't know what this was all about,\" Mr Schwarzenegger said. \"I did talk to him for several minutes and explained to him what my position was. I called back at 9 o'clock and left a message. He hasn't returned my call.\" </p> <p>Gibson, who has also recorded a radio commercial opposing the proposition to fund stem cell research, said: \"I was never in a petri dish, but at one stage I was that little cluster of cells myself, as were you, as was the doctor, as is everybody. </p> <p>\"Tell me anybody who was not that at some point in their development, and I'll give you a cigar,\" he added, in reference to Mr Schwarzenegger's custom of presenting visitors and admirers with his own brand of cigar.</p>",
  "Chelsea Clinton, who as the daughter of a serving president was shielded from media attention, gave her first political speeches at the weekend as the Democrats unveiled a last-minute campaign tactic - an appearance in Florida by the daughters of five past or would-be future presidents and vice-presidents. <p>\"To be honest, I couldn't imagine being anywhere else today,\" Ms Clinton, 24, said in Osceola County, where she appeared at a rally with Caroline Kennedy, Karenna Gore Schiff, Cate Edwards and Vanessa Kerry. </p> <p>\"I couldn't imagine not being in Florida because the stakes are too high and the choice is too clear.\" </p> <p>Admitting in advance to being \"a little nervous\", she kept her speech short and focused on the economic benefits of her father's presidency and a potential John Kerry administration. </p> <p>\"I know that it will work,\" she said of Mr Kerry's policy platform, \"because of everything that we experienced as a country during the eight years that my father served ...\" </p> <p>Ms Clinton has rarely spoken in public before. </p> <p>\"I'm not quite an old pro but thankfully, I come from a family of old pros, and hopefully I'll do them proud,\" the Associated Press news agency quoted her as saying.</p>",
  "<p>Politics<br> <strong> How to net voters in the US</strong><br> </p> <p>Howard Dean's former campaign manager Joe Trippi believes that if Democratic Senator John Kerry loses to President George Bush on November 2 the Democratic party will face a fissure of a size to allow the creation of a viable \"third force\" in US politics and upset the dominant two-party system. This new third force, he says, will be aided by the internet. </p> <p>\"If Kerry were to lose there is potential for an uprising in the Democratic party,\" Trippi told the audience at Poptech, a conference that looks at the impact of technology on popular culture, held in Camden, Maine last week. \"If the Republicans lose their party could also fracture but [not] as big.\" Trippi believes that by 2008 a candidate using the net to raise money will be working outside of the two-party structure. </p> <p>\"I believe that the only hope for our democracy is the internet,\" Trippi said. \"The internet is enabling the American people to change a system that isn't working.\" </p> <p>Of course, there have been third parties in the USA before - remember Ross Perot - but, according to Trippi, the internet and its ability to reach people in a more efficient manner will turn a third party into a powerful player. Trippi is credited with reinventing political campaigning in America with the use of the internet to raise money for the Democratic maverick Howard Dean. The former governor of Vermont broke the record as the Democratic candidate who raised the most money - some $50m - from donations of $100 or less. </p> <p>Dean's presidential campaign also pioneered dialogue with supporters via the internet. But he failed to win any primaries and bowed out of the race. Trippi said: \"John McCain tried to reform the Republicans from within and was crushed. Dean did the same and was crushed. Before the net the urge to reform had nowhere else to go.\" But Trippi believes that the internet's time has come: \"Politicians spend their time saying 'look at me', but Dean was the first one to say, 'look at you. You have the power'.\"<br><strong>Kate Bulkley</strong><br> </p> <p><strong> Advertising</strong><br> <strong> Sending out a mixed message</strong><br> </p> <p>Even though the government is the UK's second biggest advertiser, it is worried its multi-million pound media spend is not reaching everyone. Which is why, a year ago the central office of communication (COI) launched an inclusivity unit to look at how to engage marginalised audiences such as the old, those who don't speak English and the disabled. </p> <p>So far its research has focused on ethnic minorities and how effectively the messages in its TV ads are getting through to them. Take the government's anti-drugs \"Frank\" campaign, which was created for the Home Office. On the face of it, the message seems simple: if you're a parent and think your child is involved with drugs, talk to him or her. If you're a child and you're into drugs, talk to your parents. But take this message to some minorities and you open a can of worms. </p> <p>Some parents refuse to consider that their kids are using drugs because they're forbidden by the Qur'an. Others worry that if the neighbours hear them talk about drugs, it will seriously damage the chances of them marrying off their daughters. </p> <p>One Asian couple interviewed by the unit thought their heroin-addict son was addicted to chocolate when they saw silver foil covered in brown splats in his bedroom. \"Mainstream ads and media just don't work,\" says Sean Larkins, who heads up the unit. To reach these communities, mini advertising campaigns are developed. </p> <p>As part of its effort to get Asians to broach the subject of drugs with family members, for example, it created an information pack containing conversation starters, such as a themed card game. The unit also created its own campaign to run alongside the star-studded ads for the National Blood Service. Those that did come forward were offended by questions about their sexuality and whether they had ever lived in west Africa. \"It's impossible to collect blood without asking these questions, so we've had to work with marketing agencies that know how to engage these communities. </p> <p>\"Teachers, NHS professionals and Citizens Advice Bureau staff are our media,\" says Larkins. </p> <p>That's not to say the unit hasn't been applying traditional media planning techniques as well. During Ramadan it sponsored a mosque in Tower Hamlets, east London, to carry a message about quitting smoking. It provided all the food for the Iftar - the breaking of the fast - party. \"A bit about giving up smoking was even included in the sermon,\" says Patricia Macauley, the COI's ethnic minority consultant. Now that the unit has survived its first year and got buy-in from the Home Office and the Department of Work and Pensions in particular, what's on the agenda for the second year? \"Age and our ageing society,\" says Larkins.<br><strong>Suzy Bashford</strong><br> </p> <p><strong> Television</strong><br> <strong> Straight choice for a gay man</strong><br> </p> <p>James is a regular gay guy. He just wants to be loved. He has a thick neck, perfect teeth and looks like he's spent most of his life grooming himself towards life's ultimate trophy of becoming a domestic airline steward. </p> <p>He is a perfect, 2D, TV gay. Will he find love on Boy Meets Boy, America's first reality gay dating show, and Channel 5's controversial new daytime import from the States? He has 15 contestants to choose from, all of whom look like they have spent most of their thinking lives grooming themselves towards ... oh, you get the idea. Even the straight ones. Here's the USP. Some of James' prospective daters are pretending to be gay in order to win a cash prize. Ambitiously, migrant presenter Dani Behr - herself in the grips of some ghastly reality-esque makeover that has left her resembling Big Brother transsexual Nadia Almada attending a fancy dress do as Pamela Anderson - infers that there is some sort of sociological value to all this over the opening credits: \"In a world where gay is the norm and straight must stay in the closet, will boundaries be crossed? Can stereotypes be shattered? Will romance prevail? Find out when two worlds collide, when we bridge the gap between gay and straight!\" </p> <p>Quite how asking straight men to prostitute themselves for a poor gay chap who knows nothing of this rather cruel ruse is bridging any sort of gap is never fully explained. But the game of guessing who's gay and who isn't proves to be moderately good fun. Boy Meets Boy (starting November 11) is one of a legion of shows commissioned on the back of the success of the US Queer Eye For The Straight Guy. Gay men have become TV's newest and most bankable playthings. Queer Eye itself has come in for some unnecessarily shortsighted criticism. As Boy Meets Boy proves, you can borrow all the campy ephemera of its sometimes stereotypical world, but you can't fake its heart. The central conceit of Boy Meets Boy - conning a gay guy into falling for straight - is mean, but not nearly as mean as the winning prize: a trip to that infamous, buoyant gay mecca, New Zealand \"You can bungee jump there!\" informs Behr, to a suitably puzzled James. Herein lies the problem. Boy Meets Boy doesn't seem to like homosexuals very much. Hardly the best start for the world's first gay dating show.<br> <strong>Paul Flynn</strong><br> </p> <p><strong> Magazines</strong><br> <strong> Vice triumphs over sleaze</strong><br> </p> <p>Vice editor Andy Capper is on a roll. \"There are too many bad writers out there. Five or six magazines went down last year and if you looked at the contributors' panel they had 65 people all getting ridiculous word rates. We rewrite everything, and if you don't like it don't work for us.\" </p> <p>Vice magazine is that rarest of beasts - a success story in the cut-throat style sector which has seen the closures of Sleaze and The Face. Vice, which launched in the UK two years ago, made \u00a3100,000 profit last year and is expecting to clear \u00a31 million in 2005. Its 70,000 copies are distributed free every month in selected clothes and music stores across the country. </p> <p>\"The newsstand model for niche magazines with our circulation doesn't work anymore,\" says publisher Andrew Creighton, a former ad manager on i-D magazine. \"Everyone who distributes our magazine is also our readership. We get instant feedback, far better than any NRS survey. </p> <p>\"People say we're not making money on the cover price, but [our rivals] don't either. To sell 30,000 copies they have to print 100,000. We have 100% pick up rate. The idea was to create something you could sell, then give it away free.\" </p> <p>Vice began in Montreal 10 years ago. It is now in the US, Japan and Australia, and Capper and Creighton are overseeing its expansion into continental Europe, beginning with Scandinavia. They are also moving into music (the Streets is signed to Vice in the US) and television, with a documentary called How's Your News? for Channel 4, in which five severely disabled reporters cover the US election. With a clean, unfussy design, Vice combines real life (The Vice Guide to Being A Whore) with features such as Was Jesus a Fag?. There's bands like the Libertines, and lots of lists. \"Some of the things we cover are shocking by their nature,\" says ex-Bizarre editor Capper. </p> <p>\"We are probably at the ceiling now of advertisers who understand Vice [in the UK], which is why we're going into other forms of media,\" admits Creighton. \"We want to be the first true international magazine and cherrypick the best writing.\" They are even opening a pub. In east London's trendy Shoreditch, of course.<br> John Plunkett</p>",
  "<p>Something odd - going on positively bizarre - happened at the London Film Festival last week. We stood and clapped a 49-year-old movie few of us had seen before, a magnificent blast from Hollywood past. And we cheered its star because she was simply great, a wise-cracking, song-belting, screen-dominating phenomenon: the great Betty Garrett, your missing link in emotion, hope and some shame to the dog days of George W and Osama bin Laden. </p> <p>The film (to get basic recommendations over first) was My Sister Eileen in its 1955 version; script by Blake Edwards, songs by Jule Styne, direction by Richard Quine. Garrett plays plain old Ruth and Janet Leigh plays drop-dead-gorgeous Eileen, two girls from Ohio come to eat the best of the big apple and repeatedly choking on its pipsqueaks. </p> <p>These Eileen stories, New Yorker specials, were nearly a quarter of a century and many stage and screen versions old by the time 1955 came around. Maybe that was a problem: one adaptation over a load. Maybe the cast - a young Jack Lemmon, a boyish Bob Fosse acting as well as dancing - didn't have its full pulling power yet. Maybe the blight, as we shall see, was deeper. </p> <p>At any rate, it broke no box-office records and promptly disappeared from view, rescued only now from ultimate disintegration by Columbia's film restorers. As good as new? Better than that. The cheers, not just at the London festival but wherever it plays, are utterly spontaneous. And the question you ask as the lights go up comes naturally: Who was that girl, that wonderful girl? </p> <p>Which is where the shadows start to lengthen. Betty Garrett was born in St Joseph, Missouri, 85 years ago. She was a big Broadway star in the 1940s and, like so many others, Hollywood recruited her. She had a clutch of big successes - Words and Music, Take Me Out To the Ball Game, On the Town - and was on a tremendous roll. And then nothing (or rather, something) happened. </p> <p>Garrett got married in 1944 to Larry Parks from Jolson Sings Again. He was blacklisted in the proto- McCarthyite purges; so, inevitably, was she. For six long, aching years - from On The Town to My Sister Eileen - the phone didn't ring; and, after Eileen, she might as well have left it off the hook. One more film in 1957 and then Garrett seemed a forgotten name buried deep down some memory hole. She and a broken Parks did theatre to pay their bills until he died in 1974. </p> <p>What a sad story, you think, what a grievous, tragic waste of talent. Except that it's not. The unsinkable Betty - 15 years on - re-emerged on prime-time television as a sitcom sensation. She won a Golden Globe for All in the Family (America's Alf Garnett clone). She made the biggest laughs from Laverne and Shirley her own. She joined the Hollywood hall of fame last year, at 84, and (the man from Columbia says) she's planning a new stage show even today. Janet Leigh, alas, may be lately dead. Sister Ruth is vibrant and kicking. </p> <p>So here, with all the verve of a true musical, is that missing link, a power too strong for nightmares. Ask yourself: what, looking back, was the blacklist but a panic attack over some phantom enemy within, a tremor of mindless terror over a handful of actors, writers and directors who might have posed some appalling threat to America - but didn't, of course? The blacklist, like the wider workings of McCarthyism, was hysteria and corruption and cowardice mixed with cynical self-promotion. It was a black mood at a black moment, a spasm that sentient Americans prefer to forget. </p> <p>But spasms, of their nature, pass. Americans - citizens of a country which, at its best, still invites awe and admiration - have a way of picking themselves up, dusting themselves down and starting all over again. </p> <p>Garrett, cheered in triumph after 49 years of forgetfulness, is an archetypal American success story. Against all odds. And that story, of course, adds a crucial chapter on Tuesday. Enter Osama, starring in another of his taunting videos. George W rasps on about his wretchedly amorphous, inevitably endless war, John Kerry tries to trump him on ferocity. Doubtless Bin Laden smirks in a cave somewhere. Can one rich Saudi and his loose, ragtag band of zealots really pull strings as the US votes? Is that what election 2004 is truly about? </p> <p>No one, to be sure, can put aside the fundamental litany, repeated constantly: on 9/11 \"everything changed\". That is true for the thousands who died in the twin towers, for their relatives and friends. It is true for politics in its preoccupations, for busted budgets and ruptured oil pipelines, for the civil liberties we used to take for granted. It makes fear the most potent campaign weapon. It swallows hope and peddles security as the modern snake oil from Abu Ghraib to Alabama. It may so far, we Lancet learn, have cost 100,000 Iraqi civilian lives. </p> <p>But, one fine day, shall we look back and say that this was just a blacker-than-blacklist, that things were done because the CIA (like Hoover's FBI) had lost its bearings, that politicians lacked the strength or wisdom to put these nightmares back in their boxes? That, for a time, we failed to tell the difference between thuggery, zealotry, atrocity and the global conflict of Tom Clancy's wilder imaginings? </p> <p>That has been the fundamental question since September 11. It is the fundamental question to weigh at the polls tomorrow. And there, up on screen hoofing her way into history, is a living reminder that the human spirit (which we may hope, yet again, is the spirit of America) has a way of winning through. What's Betty Garrett's favourite catch phrase? It couldn't be better. It's \"Just don't panic\". </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:p.preston@theguardian.com\">p.preston@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://atomfilms.shockwave.com/af/content/goodtobeindc_af\">Good To Be In DC</a><br>All that white-hot US election fever - and a showing on Jay Leno's Tonight Show - has propelled this biting bipartisan political parody to a record number of web viewings: 7 million at the last count. In the Spirelli brothers' even-handedly offensive animation, George Bush frets: \"I wish our winning were a bit more certain/Better call my friends at Halliburton\", but those panty-waist \"liberal wieners\" Kerry, Edwards and Clinton get a fair kicking too. And a serious message sneaks in, under the froth and bubble. Look out for the high-kicking cartoon Supreme Court urging the American viewer to \"Take note. Go vote. Or we'll choose who rules in DC.\" They sure aren't whistling Dixie.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.ifilm.com/ifilmdetail/2654462\">Hate Or Date</a><br>The mystery contestant on this trashy reality TV dating show seems strangely familiar: \"I'm seeking a breeding concubine with whom I can create an immortal race of superdemons.\" So giggly bachelorette Rosemary will go home with Rosemary's Baby, if Satan's rivals (Chuck, the dotcom dweeb and Tony the arrogant actor) can't win her heart. Adam Stein's offbeat scripting lifts this cheerful, low-budget comedy above the seething mass of online spoofs: \"Guess ! We're goin' somewhere cool and s-e-x-y!\"</p> <p>\"Er ... Sodom?\"<br><a href=\"http://atomfilms.shockwave.com/af/content/ten\"><br>Ten</a><br>Sticking with the biblical shtick, the must-see comedy of the month is director Scott Smith's slick, subtle three-minute illustration of how one adulterous schlub breaks all 10 commandments before breakfast. All you've got to be is rude to your mother while working on a Sunday, and you're whooshing off the primrose path, apparently. No narrative clues are given for any of the sins - each transgression is only signalled by a giant on-screen number, a crisply sophisticated touch. So the ungodly will need to nip away and Google \"Moses\" to clarify what any less obvious infringements might be.<br><a href=\"http://escreeningroom.com/films/cf/buy.html\"><br>Crimes and Firelines</a><br>Cinematic fashion dictates that this season, righteous big-screen documentaries are hotter than a McDonald's microwaved apple pie. Determined to stay abreast of the cool-hunters, we've plucked up Jon Hanish's compassionate high-concept documentary following the surprising story of four female inmates who serve their jail time as firefighters for the US department of forestry. Vicky, Michelle, Wanda and Blanca have rap sheets boasting armed robbery, manslaughter, forgery, and drug dealing. Now, they help protect 3 million acres of California from forest fires, dangling from choppers and wielding chain-saws over burning scrubland. Heartwarming and heartstopping stuff abounds, as Hanish mixes in a stiff dose of brush-fire action amongst the \"I stole my first bike\" true confessions. We can't believe that Hollywood hasn't snapped up the rights to turn it into a Queen Latifah movie yet.</p> <p><a href=\"http://atomfilms.shockwave.com/af/content/surprise\">Surprise</a><br>Delicate as a daguerreotype, Georgian director Veit Helmer's hand-tinted silent comedy evolves from a tragic setup: a frenzied husband creates a Rube Goldberg assembly, involving crossbows, dynamite, chains and axes, around his sleeping wife. Once she wakes, the film takes off with wacky speediness, unwinding a string of slapstick shocks which are carefully calibrated to force a laugh out of the spectator. Adorable and faintly arty without being arch, this short has attracted a vast Atom Films audience simply from the fact that Mrs Slapstick appears naked throughout. While getting an eyeful, comfort yourself with the fact that they are philistines, while you are obviously a discerning connoisseur of continental cinema.<br><a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/film/shortsandclips/shorts.html\"><br>Macca's Men</a><br>Shane Meadows has garnered a cracking eight nominations for his feature film Dead Man's Shoes in this year's British Independent Film Awards. Fill in the long days until the winners are announced on November 30th, by brushing up your knowledge of his earlier work, starting with this amiable rough-edged comedy, in which Paddy Considine stars as a kids' football coach with laughably big teeth to go with his big heart. FilmFour.com are offering an enticing online package of the Nottingham auteur's finest shorts this month - including his breakthrough hit Where's The Money, Ronnie - predictably entitled \"Shane's World\". We're not worthy.</p> <p><a href=\"http://dfilm.com/index_moviemaker.html\">D-Film Moviemaker</a><br>Now that That Historic Election is all over bar the shouting, you may still be looking to make your views known. Ever thoughtful, we'd like to suggest a dalliance with this point-and-click Flash animation moviemaker, currently offering all comers the chance to script and direct their very own opinionated political parody. Hey, speech is free, and so is this baby. Feel at liberty to pop Mr Bush or Mr Kerry into, say, a romantic bubblebath with a grizzly bear, making sure to add a lurid sunset background and some 70s whaa-whacka guitar soundtrack. Then go to town on the speech bubbles (asterisks are optional), before emailing your puerile efforts around town. The creative process is easy-peasy-lemon-squeezy (they flag a \"Whoa Nelly!\" card if you mess up a step) and the end results are strangely intoxicating. Use that mouse to turn yourself into Michael Moore for a minute or two. We dare you.</p>"
