  "<p>Any catalogue of 20th-century buccaneers is bound to include the journalist Pierre Salinger, press secretary to President John Kennedy and President Lyndon Johnson, who has died of a heart attack aged 79.</p> <p>Good fortune had catapulted \"Lucky Pierre\" into the inner sanctum of the Kennedy family just as John was preparing to campaign for the presidency. Sound political instinct and a canny understanding of the media turned Pierre into a first-class presidential spokesman. Optimism, a sense of self promotion and an indestructible, childlike self-confidence enabled him to exploit his links with JFK and his two brothers to venture into several new careers - in politics, business, journalism and public relations.</p> <p>It was impossible not to admire the chutzpah that Pierre employed in his association with Kennedy - indeed, he was able to network for ever afterwards on the basis of his two and half years at Camelot. But he was no fair weather friend. He was loyal and generous to his family and his friends. Though he did not boast of it, he remained close to Edward Kennedy, and to Jackie, and to several of the younger generation of Kennedys. One reason why he continued to hustle for work until the end of his life was his need for money to support relatives who had come to depend on his help.</p> <p>Pierre was born in San Francisco, one of four brothers. His father, a mining engineer of German Jewish stock, died when Pierre was still in his teens. His mother, who lived to 98, was a spirited Frenchwoman and a noted journalist. Pierre's own love affair with the media began while he was still at high school and resumed after a colourful period of war service in the US navy in the Pacific.</p> <p>After the war, he finished his degree at the University of San Francisco, and when the San Francisco Chronicle appointed him as an investigative journalist in 1947, he landed the first of many dream jobs. A lifelong Democrat, Pierre's interest in politics began when he worked for President Harry Truman's 1948 presidential campaign. His political involvement deepened when he went to work for the senate committee on improper activities in labour and management (1957-59); Robert Kennedy was counsel to the committee. Pierre, he observed, was \"inquisitive and indefatigable\".</p> <p>Robert Kennedy recommended Pierre's appointment as publicity director for the Democratic advisory council, and by the time John Kennedy was weighing up his presidential candidacy, Pierre was already part of the Kennedy inner circle. Theodore White, the chronicler of successive campaigns, wrote of Pierre: \"Large in manner, full of gusto, a wine-drinker and brandy bibber; his mind is at once jovial and quick, shrewd, practical ... No one remembers Salinger with anything but respect and affection.\"</p> <p>As President Kennedy's press secretary, the stocky, cigar-puffing bon viveur proved his professional mettle. Guaranteed \"total access\" to the Oval Office, and allowed a free hand to open the new administration to media inspection, Pierre was energetic and innovative and effected lasting improvements in news management.</p> <p>Although devastated by Kennedy's assassination in November 1963, he agreed to stay on as President Johnson's press secretary.</p> <p>In 1964, Pierre made a brief excursion into senatorial politics. After the death of Clair Eagle, one of California's incumbent senators, Pierre was appointed to fill the place for the 148 days of the remaining term. He was defeated in the subsequent election, but stayed on in California to embark on a business career, and to work with Robert Kennedy during his bid to win the California primary in 1968.</p> <p>Robert's assassination was another bitter blow and Pierre now decided to seek his fortunes in France. He eventually went back to journalism, and a job with the French weekly, L'Express. He remained there until 1978, when he earned the honour of being sacked by the new proprietor, James Goldsmith. The US TV network, ABC, came to the rescue by appointing him Paris bureau chief. In 1983 ABC moved him to London as the network's chief foreign correspondent. </p> <p>During the Paris years, a still star-struck Pierre established himself in France as \"Mr America\", obtained \"exclusives\" with world figures, including Fidel Castro, and Grace Kelly, hob-nobbed with President Mitterrand and Mohamed Al Fayed, sailed with Jackie and Aristotle Onassis and served on a Cannes Festival jury.</p> <p>In 1976, Pierre was brash enough to ask the new President Jimmy Carter for the US embassy in France. Carter made no response. He tried again when Bill Clinton became president, but was ignored. It was one of Pierre's few unfulfilled dreams. As ABC's chief foreign correspondent, London became a base for ceaseless travel. But relations with ABC soured, and he left the company in 1992.</p> <p>He moved back to Washington to become a senior executive with the public relations giant, Burson Marsteller. When this ended in 1996, Pierre, still unwilling to retire, undertook to promote the French city of Lille's campaign to secure the Olympic games for 2004. With Athens in the running, it was a foolhardy campaign.</p> <p>I first met Pierre in 1962, when he was riding high as press secretary, and I was a reporter new to the Washington scene. He was helpful with information, opened White House doors and gave me the opportunity to meet John and Robert Kennedy. We became friends, and kept in touch. Many years later, while he worked for ABC News in London, he claimed good contacts with a variety of intelligence services, especially in the Middle East and often volunteered \"exclusive\" information.</p> <p>Indeed, he won a number of journalism prizes including a George Polk award for his 1981 documentary on the US government's secret negotiations to free Americans held hostage by Iran.</p> <p>Not all of it was as reliable as he believed. He lost credibility when he claimed that the 1988 loss of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie was the result of a US Drug Enforcement Agency operation that went dramatically wrong; and when Pierre tried to insist that the 1996 crash of TWA 800 over Long Island, New York, was caused by stray US navy missiles, there was virtually nobody who took him seriously. The crash was due to mechanical fault and Pierre had been taken in by an internet hoax.</p> <p>But thanks to high level contacts in Iraq, he certainly had provided the Guardian with a world scoop during the first Gulf war crisis, when he gave me the transcript of Saddam Hussein's exchanges with April Glaspie, the US ambassador in Iraq. These showed that far from warning Iraq against pursuing its territorial claims in Kuwait, the US had signalled that it \"had no opinion\" and would not intervene.</p> <p>Though in many respects Pierre lived a charmed life, he suffered a series of tragedies: a brother and one of his three sons committed suicide; his only daughter died of cancer; his first wife was an alcoholic.</p> <p>However many times he stumbled and fell, he always stood up again. Pierre acknowledged many infidelities, and accepted that where women were concerned his judgment was often flawed. It was only when he married for the fourth time that he felt he had found his ideal partner. Pierre and Nicole, who changed her name to Poppy to distinguish herself from Pierre's third wife, also called Nicole, settled in Provence. But for the past four years, he suffered from Alzheimer's, and the throaty Pierre voice had not been heard in public.</p> <p>In his autobiography, Pierre wrote his own epitaph: \"I have had at least my part of tragedy, but I have felt I have had far more than my share of happiness. And, Lord knows, at the very least I have seen a lot. Perhaps those people were right years ago when they nicknamed me Lucky Pierre.\"</p> <p>He is survived by Poppy, and two sons, one each from his first and third marriages.</p> <p><strong>&amp;#183</strong> Pierre Emil George Salinger, journalist, born June 14 1925; died October 16 2004</p>",
  "<p>Advertising<br> </p> <p><strong> B for British in Baghdad</strong><br> Never mind the coalition troops capturing Iraq, now the BBC - mocked as the Baghdad Broadcasting Corporation by its critics - is hoping to liberate the country's airwaves by mounting a marketing strike. In an operation to ensure war-torn Iraqis are switched on to the BBC, they have erected a billboard in perhaps the most unlikely of locations - Baghdad. Perched on a rooftop in the midst of a bustling street in the commercial district, the hoarding urges commuters to turn their dials to the Arabic Service. However, it was no easy feat, taking months of protracted negotiations, complicated by the handover of power. Yet Al Mansour now joins the list of international locations being used to expand the BBC's global wares. \"The timing and location took months to negotiate,\" explains Jane Futrell, head of BBC World Service international marketing, \"but research proves our audience is growing rapidly on FM. There is a need for impartial international news and it is important people know how to access us.\" </p> <p>The 14 x 4 metre poster prominently features the slogan \"The World, Your News in Arabic\" and the BBC is optimistic that it can feed the voracious appetite for news and information in the current climate. With seven dedicated FM frequencies already boasting 3.3 million listeners, it hopes to expand its reach further in a country devoid of free and independent media for decades under Saddam Hussein, yet now home to a burgeoning news industry. </p> <p>This strategy of becoming the station of choice is aided by being the only international broadcaster to win permission for such a billboard. The media space was bought for an undisclosed figure through a Lebanese company, which negotiated with the Baghdad authorities, and is now hunting down additional sites throughout the country. With the BBC's distinctive side-on logo, the hoarding could prove a welcome sight for Westerners in the city, but is there a fear that it could become a target of anti-Western hostility? Futrell responds: \"I'm hoping not. All I can do is put it there, but I wouldn't want to do anything that would endanger anybody.\" </p> <p>However, Al Mansour has suffered from a number of fatal attacks recently and is where British hostage Ken Bigley was seized last month. There might not be many takers to live or work in a building shadowed by a four-metre high BBC logo.<br><strong>Rob Harris</strong> </p> <p> <strong> Press</strong> </p> <p><strong> Maximising exposure</strong><br> Viewers of television news bulletins last weekend would have seen undercover video footage of the Barcelona abortion clinic that featured in the Sunday Telegraph's splash that day. The footage supported their story - that the clinic offers illegal late abortions to women referred to it by the British Pregnancy Advice Service. But its existence also helped the story get a much better run on rolling news services such as Sky, as well as network news bulletins, than the typical newspaper investigative story that has only documents or audio recordings as evidence. </p> <p>The Sun employed a similar trick last month when reporter Anthony France smuggled a \"bomb\" into the Palace of Westminster, where he was working undercover as a waiter. Video of him assembling the device in a toilet was seen by millions of viewers on the late BBC and ITV bulletins after the paper's first edition hit the streets, with the Sun's logo prominently displayed at the top of the screen. </p> <p>The use of undercover video by television reporters is nothing new, but more newspapers - even quality titles - seem to be waking up to the technique as a way of maximising coverage of their big scoops. </p> <p>However, getting the masthead on television is not the prime motivation, according to Daniel Foggo, the Sunday Telegraph reporter who accompanied Charlotte Edwardes and shot the video using a specially adapted jacket equipped with a video camera and sound recording equipment. He says that video is concrete proof, should a story be contested in court: \"People cannot argue with it.\" It also seems to increase the story's credibility, Foggo adds. \"A story is believed more when people can see it on TV.\" <br><strong>Chris Johnston </strong> </p> <p><strong> Television</strong> <br><strong> Could it happen here?</strong><br> If more than 62 million people watch a political debate instead of a soap or a reality show, is it good for the democratic process? Discuss ... While a fascinated America follows the ups and downs of the three-round John Kerry versus George Bush TV battle, what chance is there of UK leaders in a head-to-head? Polls show record levels of public disaffection, TV political coverage is largely marginalised, but Tony Blair's advice has been to steer clear, even though colleagues say \"something must be done\" about voter apathy. It looks as if America may have provided the answer, with 62.5 million tuning in for the first show down; 15 million more than watched the last-ever episode of Friends and 35 million more than the TV audience for the Oscars. It's also 40% more than watched the Bush-Gore debate of 2000, suggesting that September 11, the war on terror and Iraq have heightened political awareness and increased the appetite for mainstream, prime-time political specials that are not required by law; Bush and Kerry took part voluntarily. </p> <p>So will a Blair, Howard and Kennedy roadshow be coming to your TV screen? The omens, so far, are not good. In 2001, ITV and BBC made a joint approach for leaders' debates. The Liberal Democrats said yes; the Conservatives said yes; and there was an encouraging grunt from Alastair Campbell who said he had a \"hunch\" that the debates would happen. However, late in the day, broadcasters were told that Blair had been advised he had nothing to gain from the exercise so it didn't happen. That decision was rewarded with a 59% turnout, the lowest number of voters in 80 years, but an even bigger parliamentary majority for Labour. </p> <p>For now, the Conservatives say they would welcome a debate: \"a healthy development for the British general election\", a spokesman said. The Liberal Democrats have always been in favour and say there's even more of case in 2005. As for Labour, senior sources remain sceptical saying it is unwise to draw parallels with the US. A spokesman said: \"All the evidence we have is that politicians standing head-to-head and attacking each other is exactly the sort of thing that voters do not want to see.\" <br><strong>Steve Anderson, the creative director of Mentorn TV, who led the ITV/BBC bid for a leaders' debate in 2001 </strong> </p> <p><strong> News agency</strong><br> <strong> Click-and-tell </strong><br> When attractive young women want to dish the dirt on their Saturday night encounters with worse-for-wear football players, they might normally be expected to turn to an agent like Max Clifford. But, according to a news agency based in Norfolk, members of the public with stories to tell are not as media savvy as the likes of Rebecca Loos, and are often wary about calling high-profile publicists or the newsdesks of tabloids. So the KNS agency has set up a website, cash4yourstory, to take advantage of the growing trend in kiss-and-tell stories - although it warns there is not as much money in it as some people think. Mark Houldy, the agency's news editor, says the idea for a website - which has been promoted with advertisements on the London underground - came from a desire to attract members of the public with stories to tell, but who are unsure of how to get them told. </p> <p>\"It has been worthwhile - we get on average about one contact a day from the website, and about half of them are inquiries that we can act on. There are a lot of people out there with stories and they don't know how to publicise them or get cash out of them.\" He adds that most people do not have much of an idea of how much a story is worth. They are used to seeing telephone-number figures discussed in the press, whereas few stories are worth more than a few thousand pounds and many only net a few hundred. Nevertheless, the first question callers tend to ask is \"How much?\" </p> <p>Houldy says he deals in a wide range of stories, including celebrity kiss-and-tell, unusual family circumstances and experiences, and whistleblowers. The agency has supplied stories such as \"You are intellectually inferior, TV Trisha tells Norfolk women\" (Daily Telegraph) and \"Tony Martin's personal police station\" (Daily Mail). Some of the agency's work is of a more worthy nature: Terry Fisher, co-ordinator of a pensioners' group in Bridlington, used KNS after failing to interest the local newspaper in a story about a practice of using care assistants in local nursing homes to certify death without the presence of a doctor. KNS checked out his story, sold it to the Mirror, and the modest fee benefited Fisher's group. The local newspaper, which had initially turned the story down apparently because it was too politically sensitive, promptly followed it up.<br> Matt Wells</p>",
  "<p>Terrorism. Unbridled power. The invasion of Iraq and the President who got us all into it. It's life, of course, but it's althat so art. Theatre in New York this autumn is top-heavy with topical plays, political plays, plays about war, monomaniacal leaders and their victims. Spitting features prominently in a few, too. Those who go to the theatre for escape and a few laughs are advised to try another diversion altogether. Try a stroll in Central Park - it's refurbished, the leaves are beginning to turn and really, it's rather safe these days. </p> <p>For new shows, forget Broadway. Everybody I spoke to - with the exception of agents pushing their Broadway clients - agreed that the interesting new shows are on off-Broadway or off-off-Broadway. Forget musicals, almost. And gird yourself for stories apparently spun directly from World News Tonight. </p> <p>One of the most anticipated is God of Hell, by the suddenly ubiquitous Sam Shepard. In it, the livelihood of a Midwestern cattle-raising couple is threatened by an evil government official, with a fugitive from a nuclear laboratory fitting in somewhere. Shepard has said it's really about Republican fascism, and it's opening a few days before the election for a month-long run. </p> <p>Shepard will be showing up on stage, as well, for the first time in New York in some 20 years. He's playing in Caryl Churchill's A Number, a drama (which premiered at London's Royal Court two years ago) about genetic engineering, with Shepard as the father of three - at least - cloned sons. </p> <p>Theatre-goers willing to stew in outrage over the war and the President can look to two other offerings from London: Democracy , opening next month, and the highly praised Guantanamo: Honor Bound to Defend Freedom which opened in August. </p> <p>There are productions of classics - but they provide no flight from grim headlines. The Shakespeare playing in New York isn't All's Well that Ends Well , it's Richard III at the Public Theatre - the perfect complement to the city's intense paranoiac mood. </p> <p>Richard is Peter Dinklage, from the last year's lovely independent film Station Agent . At 4ft6in, he forgoes the hunchback and effectively uses his height as his embittering deformity. It's emphasised - he wears an ermine-lined cape that nearly swamps him, and he has to clamber awkwardly up onto the throne. With a lesser actor, it would be comic. But Dinklage's glowering eyes and commanding malevolence chill any impulse to giggle. When he climbs onto the long table, stomps to the end and kicks Hastings and orders him executed, it is not even faintly ludicrous. It is scary - and scarily apt. It could be a news report about Saddam's sons. </p> <p> <strong> MEANWHILE,</strong> downstairs at the Public, an impressive portrayal of another powerful historical figure is going on. Judith Ivey, in Dirty Tricks , her one-woman show, plays Martha Mitchell, the estranged wife of Nixon's attorney general. Opinionated and very loud, Mrs Mitchell was, despite Nixon's best efforts, unstoppable and 30 years ago precisely, helped to topple the President. </p> <p>Not all the new plays are political. But they aren't easy strolls, either. The major dramas are about anomie, for instance, or crushing boredom, while the new comedies concern terminal cancer and the imminence of decay and death. But it's not as depressing as it sounds. The playwrights and actors manage, with heartening frequency, to take the glum and messy material of life and turn it into compelling theatre. </p> <p>The most talked-about new show - or rather, the most exclaimed, scolded and gasped over - is surely the stark and strange Hedda Gabler , directed by Ivo van Hove and playing until the end of the month at the New York Theatre Workshop. The Flemish van Hove made something of a name for himself in New York theatre circles for his equally weird but poorly received A Streetcar Named Desire - with a Blanche who was usually either in the tub or beside it. </p> <p>Elizabeth Marvel was that Blanche; now she is Hedda in a skimpy pink slip her vaunted home - for which she married an insipid academic - a cold and barren Manhattan loft as echoing as an empty train tunnel. </p> <p>This is not at all a naturalistic Hedda Gabler . The characters go from crushed whispers to reverberating yelling in seconds. Though the emotions are modern - frustration, boredom, touches of sadism - the production seems stylised, like Kabuki or a contemporary morality play. Towards the end, Judge Brack contemptuously pours V-8 over Hedda in her pink slip, spits in her mouth (eliciting a spontaneous 'eeeuuuww' from the audience) and forces her into sodomy position. Clearly not a Hedda for the overly sensitive. </p> <p>Two other major dramas are due in November, in addition to A Number . The Pulitzer Prize-winning 'Night, Mother by Marsha Norman is being revived. And A Gem of the Ocean , opens, the next-to-last of August Wilson's 10 plays about African-Americans, one for each decade of the 20th century. Starring in each are women very familiar to TV viewers. Edie Falco of The Sopranos is the druggy divorcee in 'Night, Mother , who argues eloquently for suicide; Phylicia Rashad from The Cosby Show plays Aunt Ester in Gem , a mystic and earthy character 287 years old. </p> <p>The major new comedy - Last Easter by Byrony Lavery - has as grim-sounding a tale as 'Night, Mother (which, incidentally, has unexpectedly funny moments). A New Yorker, one of a group of friends, receives a diagnosis of cancer. The friends - all theatre people - go to Lourdes for a miracle. Though Frozen , Lavery's recent drama about serial murder, was highly praised, critics have been lukewarm, at best, about Last Easter . They call the jokes stale and the characters' zaniness forced. </p> <p>Along with war plays, there are also the odd heart-warmers on off-Broadway. The best, perhaps, is A String of Pearls . Though its plot might sound familiar, give it a chance. It's about the lives of people who have had possession of a necklace in its eventful existence. The pearls are handed from husband to wife to daughter, to a kindly landlady, to a Tunisian hotel housekeeper, to a ballet-company chaperone whose father and twin sister were murdered by the Nazis, to a 300-pound lesbian gravedigger; there are many others. Both the writing and the acting work beautifully, by turns funny, angry, moving and sexy. </p> <p> Trying is a more sentimental heart-warmer. Joanna McClelland Glass, the author, drew on her experiences 35 years ago as secretary to Francis Biddle, a Nuremberg Trial judge and attorney general under Franklin Roosevelt. In the play, the judge is ageing, painfully arthritic and irascible to the extreme - and encountering his latest secretary, a young Canadian new to Washington. He proceeds to bark at her, and growls when she splits her infinitives. Will the two of them warm to each other by the end and become close and loving friends? Will Richard III lose his horse? But however obvious the play's trajectory, it's worth attending to see Fritz Weaver's nuanced portrayal of the brilliant, patrician judge. </p> <p>On to the musicals - which are very few, and only two of which are new. There's a revival of La Cage aux Folles opening next month. The other two musicals could not be more diametrically opposed in mood and music. La Belle \u00c9poque , opening at Lincoln Centre in two weeks, is a drama with dance about Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and the absinthe-soaked Moulin Rouge in Paris in the 1890s. Martha Clarke, the eminent choreographer, created the dances to the music of Satie and Debussy. </p> <p>The other musical, which is on Broadway, is the bluntly titled: Brooklyn: The Musical . It may yet - or may not - turn out to be a crowd-pleaser. It's about Brooklyn - but not just that Brooklyn. Three girls from Brooklyn make up a story about a girl named Brooklyn who travels from Paris to - you guessed it - in order to look for the father she's never known. It has all the elements of a highly familiar type of Broadway musical - soppiness, tear-inducing schmaltz, rousing humalong tunes with a score of pop, soul and R&amp;B. It's a soppy heart-warmer, a tear-inducing, schmaltzy hum-along with a pop, soul and R&amp;B score. The only surprising thing about it is that it's the only one of its kind opening this season. Maybe Broadway producers just couldn't find much to sing about right now.</p>",
  "It will, we are confidently told, be the most important American election for generations. In the words last week of Dick Cheney, the voice of what passes for gravitas in the Bush Administration, Americans will have to make 'about as serious a decision as anybody is ever asked to make' when they go to the polls in 17 days' time. <p>The prophets of doom, whom Cheney exemplifies, are precisely right about the importance of this election. But the momentous decision awaiting Americans is not whether they return to power a President who is uniquely qualified to protect the US against terrorism, as Cheney et al would have us believe. It is whether they re-elect a man who, it is now clear, has become palpably unstable. </p> <p>The evidence has been before our eyes for some time, but only during the course of this election campaign has it crystallised - just in time, possibly, for the 2 November election. The 43rd US President has always had a much-publicised knack for mangled syntax, but now George Bush often searches an agonisingly long time, sometimes in vain, for the right words. His mind simply blanks out at crucial times. He is prone, I am told, to foul-mouthed temper tantrums in the White House. His handlers now rarely allow him to speak an unscripted word in public. </p> <p>Indeed, there are now several confusing faces to the US President, and we saw three of them in the live, televised Presidential debates with John Kerry that culminated last Wednesday night in Tempe, Arizona. In the first debate on 30 September, watched by more than 62 million viewers, we saw Bush at his most unattractive: slouching, peevish, pouting, pursing his lips with disdain at what his opponent was saying. But he was unable to marshal any coherent arguments against Kerry and merely spewed out prepared talking points - in what, even his ardent supporters concede, was Bush's worst-ever such performance. </p> <p>In the second debate on 8 October in St Louis, Bush could not stay on his stool and leapt up to dispense what were - certainly in contrast to Kerry's cogent recital of statistics and arguments - frequently defensive, shouting rants. I assume that he was told by his handlers not to show displeasure at Kerry's words this time around, but, instead, he revealed his anger by blinking repeatedly. </p> <p>The moderator tried to stop him talking at one point (both campaign organisations had agreed the order in which the candidates could speak, with time limits imposed on both), but Bush insisted on riding roughshod over the briefly protesting moderator, Charles Gibson. (What, I wonder, would have happened if Gibson had kept to the rules and insisted that Bush stop talking? We will never know.) </p> <p>By the time of the third debate on 13 October, this one witnessed by more than 50 million people, Bush had adopted yet another baffling persona. This time, he was peculiarly flushed, leading a colleague to speculate whether he was on something. He had clearly been told to look positive - that was his main thrust of the evening, with frequent assertions that 'freedom is on the march' - and spent the evening with a creepy, inane grin on his face, as though he was red-faced after a festive Christmas dinner. </p> <p>So what is up with the US President, and why is this election so crucial not only for America but for the world? I have been examining videos of his first 1994 debate with Ann Richards, the Governor of Texas, who he was about to supplant, and of his 2000 debates with Al Gore. In his one and only debate with Richards a decade ago, Bush was fluent and disciplined; with Gore, he had lost some of that polish but was still articulate, with frequent invocations of his supposed 'compassionate conservatism'. </p> <p>It is thus hard to avoid the conclusion that Bush's cognitive functioning is not, for some reason, what it once was. I am not qualified to say why this is so. It would not be surprising if he was under enormous stress, particularly after the 9/11 atrocities in 2001, and I gather this could explain much, if not everything. </p> <p>But I have heard wild speculation in Washington that he is suffering from a neurological disorder, or that the years of alcoholism might finally be taking their toll on his brain. </p> <p>I think it unlikely that Bush was wearing a bug so that he could be fed lines in at least one of the debates, but it is indicative of how his capabilities are regarded these days that the suggestion that he needed advice is given credence, as well as passing mentions in the powerful Washington Post and New York Times . </p> <p>It does not help that Bush now lives in a positively Nixonian cocoon. He does not read newspapers; he sees television only to watch football; he makes election speeches exclusively at ticket-only events, and his courtiers consciously avoid giving him bad news. When he met John Kerry for their first bout on the debating platform, it was almost a new experience for the President to hear the voice of dissent. </p> <p>A senior Republican, experienced and wise in the ways of Washington, told me last Friday that he does not necessarily accept that Bush is unstable, but what is clear, he added, is that he is now manifestly unfit to be President. </p> <p>This, too, is a view that is widely felt, but seldom articulated and then only in private, within the Republican as well as Democratic establishments in Washington. Either way, the choice voters make on Tuesday fortnight should be obvious: whether he is unstable or merely unfit to be President - and I would argue that they amount to much the same - he should speedily be turfed out of office. </p> <p>But Bush and his handlers like Cheney are driven, if nothing else, by a primal and overriding need to win, to destroy enemies who are blocking their way (shades, again, of Nixon?). Thus the speeches Bush now reads to the Republican faithful at his campaign meetings reflect their intent to demonise and annihilate Kerry's character in the eyes of the electorate; policy statements made by Kerry are wilfully distorted and then endlessly repeated so that, in the end, the distortions gain a credence among the majority who do not follow such matters closely. </p> <p>Whether the American electorate choose to see the mounting, disturbing evidence about their President or whether they rally to Cheney's obscenely manipulative appeals for their patriotic support is still up in the air. </p> <p>Kerry is a poor candidate who has only recently woken to the need to fight. Bush manages to maintain a peculiarly American, ordinary bloke image - mystifyingly so, given that he is the privileged product of Andover, Yale and Harvard - that still contrasts well, in the eyes of many Americans, with Kerry's patrician manner. </p> <p>The polls taken since Wednesday night's debate are infuriatingly contradictory, too. The only consoling thought is that soon we should know the result of that very serious decision the American people have to make on polling day. There are not many occasions when I agree with anything that Dick Cheney says, but this is one of the rare moments when I concur totally with those chilling words. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Mary Riddell is away</p>",
  "The hall was dark and so was Lynn Cheney's mood. The wife of America's Vice President pulled no punches in saying exactly what she thought of John Kerry. <p>There was a saying in her home state of Wyoming for people like Kerry, she told a crowd of Republicans in Pennsylvania who had just watched the third presidential debate in a dimly lit hotel ballroom. 'When you keep trying to make something look good and it is not so good, you call it putting lipstick on a pig,' she snarled to the crowd's raucous laughter. </p> <p>Calling Kerry 'a pig' was extraordinary language, even by the standards of an American election campaign that has plumbed new depths of bitterness and divisiveness. No one in the hall batted an eyelid. And no Democrats complained. There is probably worse to come from both sides. With 16 days until voting, the rival campaigns are furiously on the attack. The mud is flying so thick and fast that it obscures the central fact of the campaign: it is neck and neck. </p> <p>Kerry's performance in the three presidential debates has hauled him back into the race. A quick glance at the polls proves that. In the ABC tracking poll on 1 October, Bush was five points ahead of Kerry. By 12 October, both candidates were on 48 per cent. In the Washington Post tracking poll, the gap went from a five-point Bush lead to Kerry edging ahead 49 per cent to 48 per cent. Most polls now have Bush with a narrow lead but within the margin of error, in effect making the race a tie. At any rate, Kerry will be more than happy to enter the home straight tucked in just behind the leader. </p> <p>Few would have predicted such a recovery in September. Kerry had endured a series of devastating attacks on his Vietnam record that had left his campaign floundering. Now the debates have changed what looked like a comfortable Bush win back into a race to the finish. The fight will be a brutal slugging match between two campaigns that believe they can win if they make their opponent's faults the main issue. </p> <p>It will be fought in an ever decreasing handful of swing states. So far, 10 states have received 75 per cent of all election advertising and that focus will likely tighten further on the 'Big Four' of Ohio, Florida, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. It is here that the real electoral battle has begun and it is now a simple mass mobilisation to get out the vote. In most states new voter registration has ended. Swing voters, too, have dried up (one recent Time poll had the number of swing voters as low as 3 per cent). Each side must now turn out its troops. The arguments are over. The ground war has begun. </p> <p>Deep in a forest park outside the small Pennsylvania town of Saxonburg, a local sports hero spoke to a crowd of 3,000 Republican supporters awaiting the arrival of Dick Cheney. Sid Bream, a legend at the Pittsburgh Pirates baseball team, was stumping for Cheney and President George W Bush. But his sights were set on Kerry and his words were full of anger. </p> <p>Kerry was a man, Bream said, who would take away America's cherished freedoms. 'The Democrats are the ones who want to burn the flag,' he said 'They want to push abortion, they want to push sex for teens.' His bloodcurdling language did not stop there. In the rural woods and farms of Pennsylvania, hunting is huge; most households own guns. 'We need to make sure that you tell your hunting buddies and let them know that I guarantee that John Kerry and John Edwards will be trying to take away your guns,' Bream declared. </p> <p>There is no evidence for that. Kerry has spoken about his passion for hunting on several occasions. But this is no time to let facts get in the way of the 'red meat' of campaign rhetoric. Cheney is a master at this. When his battle bus arrived at Saxonburg it circled the crowd once and then Cheney stepped out to cheers of 'Four more years!' from the ecstatic crowd. He, too, pulled no punches as he launched into his favourite campaign theme of the war on terror. 'We face an enemy every bit as dedicated to destroying us as the Axis powers were during World War Two,' he said in his sardonic and brooding style. </p> <p>But no one should doubt that the Democrats, too, are playing dirty. During last week's debate, Kerry specifically mentioned Cheney's lesbian daughter, Mary, during an answer about gay marriage. Edwards had also gone out of his way to bring her up when he debated with Cheney. Kerry's move outraged Republicans. 'What a cheap and tawdry political trick,' Lynn Cheney said. Kerry's campaign manager Mary Beth Cahill merely said Cheney's daughter was 'fair game'. Even some liberal gay activist groups were furious. But Democrat strategists believe the move could chip away at the Republicans' conservative base. </p> <p>There have been other incidents. During protests by a union group outside Republican campaign headquarters, violent scuffles broke out as attempts were made to storm the offices. One campaign worker in Florida suffered a broken wrist. In Tennessee, a Republican campaign office had bullets fired into it. </p> <p>Across the country, emotions are running high. At the Saxonburg rally, Eunice Hixon, a retired nurse, described a neighbour who had put up Kerry signs on her front lawn. She said: 'They are jerks. Democrats are just jerks.' </p> <p>Thirty miles away in downtown Pittsburgh, Kerry supporter John Simpson was as emphatic as Hixon. 'I support Kerry because I think Bush is a moron,' he said. </p> <p>After an election campaign that has lasted for over a year, it seems there is little debate left on the issues. That might be because the two sides have staked out different territory. Bush has outlined a conservative social agenda that could see an attack on the right to have an abortion. He wants to further modify taxes and amend the constitution to ban gay marriage. Kerry has taken a liberal stance on these issues, including a promise to remove Bush's tax cuts on the wealthiest Americans. </p> <p>After the Saxonburg rally the crowd were greeted by a handful of Kerry supporters. One man wore a hood with wires on to imitate the victims of the Abu Ghraib prison scandal. Arguments broke out and abuse was shouted. One woman, driving an SUV, twice steered her car off the road, apparently aiming at the protesters. In 2004, American election rallies are not for the faint-hearted. </p> <p>At the heart of the new fierceness to the race is Kerry's remarkable recovery. Conventional wisdom has put the surge down to his performance in the first debate, when he appeared calm while Bush made faces as he got visibly angrier at the senator's challenges on Iraq. </p> <p>But the truth goes back further. It lies with Kerry's appointment of a slew of top former Bill Clinton aides, including Mike McCurry and Joe Lockhart, at the beginning of September. It also lies with a 90-minute phone call Kerry had with the former President as Clinton lay in a hospital bed after heart surgery. The advice was simple: it was time for gloves off. Since then, Kerry's campaign has gone on the attack, especially about Iraq. That allowed Kerry to take the fight to Bush in the first debate, scheduled to be on foreign policy, and blow him out of the water. </p> <p>Kerry was also helped by his formidable debating skills and a hard-earned reputation throughout his long political career as a strong finisher. The Democrats went in to the first debate knowing it was their last best chance to shake the dynamics of the race. They took it. 'Three weeks ago it looked all over. Kerry has become more likeable again,' said Ken Warren, a political scientist at St Louis University. </p> <p>The debate caught the Republicans off guard. Despite his common man reputation and manglings of the English language, Bush is a strong debater. But his skills were rusty. In four years as President, Bush has held only 15 solo press conferences, while Clinton by this time had held 42 and Bush's father 83. Kerry also played dirty, pressing Bush's psychological buttons by attacking him constantly on Iraq and comparing his record to that of his father. </p> <p>The result was a disaster for Bush, causing even his wife Laura to scold him for 'not being yourself'. Top Republican strategists had seen the debates as a final hurdle on the road to victory. And they fell at it. 'They were just caught flat-footed by the first debate. They simply did not expect Bush to lose,' said David Lanoue, head of the political unit at the University of Alabama. Bush recovered in the final two match-ups but it was only enough to staunch the wound. In public, his aides had pushed out the line that it would always end with a close fight, while privately believing that their position after the New York convention was looking comfortable. In the end it was their spin, not their conviction, that was right. </p> <p>No one needs to tell Pastor Jack Stepp about conviction. At a Republican debate-watch party in the Pittsburgh suburb of Coraopolis, he led the crowd in a prayer. Though he wore his clerical collar, he also had a Bush-Cheney sticker on his black shirt. He prayed for a Bush victory in the debate and asked God to give Bush the 'gift of compelling speech'. He ended with a nod to election day. 'I pray we may today see victory right through to November,' he intoned. 'Amen,' the crowd replied. </p> <p>Both sides are pulling out all the stops. Cheney's visit to Saxonburg was the first by a Vice-President to the surrounding Butler County in 22 years, and so it gathered huge local press coverage. It is the same story all over the swing states. Bush recently visited Portsmouth, Ohio, making him the first President to do so since Herbert Hoover in 1932. Kerry went one better. He stopped at Newark, Ohio, the first drop-in by a presidential candidate since William Henry Harrison in 1840. </p> <p>Never has such a small group of swing states assumed so much importance. Pennsylvania is near the top of the list. This week Bush will make three visits there, Kerry two. Each campaign spends about $2 million a week advertising on Pennsylvanians' televisions and radios. It is a Democrat bellwether state. If Kerry wins here, he will have secured his base. If Bush wins, then Kerry will be facing deep trouble across the swing states. At the moment, Kerry's national advance has been mirrored in Pennsylvania. Bush had led here but the latest poll has Kerry two points up. </p> <p>The debates are over and both sides know that what will decide it now is organisation. It is getting voters to polling stations, making sure everyone who can cast a vote does so and that no one is left behind. Bush's political guru Karl Rove has created a vast pyramid structure that has its apex at campaign headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, and its base in every campaign office across the country. It is highly disciplined and has 1.2 million volunteers. It also has an intense battle plan for the final 72 hours of the campaign on which workers have been sworn to secrecy. 'I just can't talk about it,' said one Ohio Republican county chairwoman with a smile. </p> <p>Rove's organisation was set up to counter the historical advantage the Democrats have on the ground. This time they are backed by new campaigning organisations, such as America Coming Together, which have registered hundreds of thousands of new voters and pounded the streets delivering an anti-Bush message. In Ohio alone, America Coming Together made 3.7 million visits to voters. In one week its volunteers knocked on one million doors across the country. </p> <p>Both sides believe they can still win outright. Both are probably right. But with the election poised on a knife-edge, some are already looking ahead to a possible repeat of the fiasco of Florida in 2000. In fact in Florida alone, each side has prepared up to 2,000 lawyers to contest any problems in that state. </p> <p>Elsewhere, ready-made lawsuits have been prepared in the event of any hint of irregularity at polls. The prospect of elections being decided in court and not at the ballot box is very real. Part of that is due to the existence of very few actual ballot boxes. Computerised voting has spread to most states and led to allegations that without a 'paper trail' to verify controversial results the election can be easily challenged by the losing side. </p> <p>A host of other elements could swing a narrow election. There is the Nader factor. Third party left-wing candidate Ralph Nader, whom many Democrats blame for the loss in 2000, is on the ballot in 34 states and that figure may yet rise to 42. He is scoring between 1 and 3 per cent in most polls but that is more than the difference between Kerry and Bush in several swing states. There is also the prospect of a terrorist attack on or just before election day and what is seen as an inevitable raising of the terror alert system across the US in the coming days. Most experts believe that would swing a few percentage points to Bush. </p> <p>Finally, and just beginning to emerge on the political radar screen, is the 'Colorado question'. American elections are decided by an electoral college of votes counted from each state and weighted for population size (hence California has 55 votes and Idaho four). It is a winner-takes-all system. But this year Colorado voters are being asked to choose to get rid of that and split the state's nine votes proportionally to reflect the two candidates' percentage of the ballot. </p> <p>In a razor thin result, that could make all the difference nationally. It is quite possible that, this time, the lawyers will be heading for Denver, not Miami. </p> <p>As a steady rain began to fall in the Saxonburg forest last week, Cheney ploughed on aggressively. At the end of his speech he said one of the few things that Democrats and Republicans agree on: 'The differences between the President and his opponent are as stark as they can possibly be. The consequences are enormous,' he said. </p> <p>That is true. Ironically, the Iraq war - the dominant factor in American politics for almost two years - will probably play no further role in the debate. Most voters have made up their mind on the issue. You either trust Bush on the war or you hate him for it. 'We would not be in Iraq in the way we are unless George Bush put us there for a good reason,' said insurance worker Karen McKee with complete belief. She had brought her children to see Cheney at the Saxonburg rally. Pittsburgh banker Dave Sunderlin begged to differ. 'Bush lied, probably just for the oil,' he said bluntly. It is the clash of such opposing views in one state that makes Pennsylvania so important to both sides. </p> <p>Which view will carry the day on 2 November is yet to be decided. Only the foolish would try to predict it. Taking a cigarette break outside his downtown Pittsburgh office, Sunderlin blew out a cloud of smoke and called it better than most pundits: 'If anyone says they know who is going to win then they are full of bull. No one knows. It is just too close.'</p>",

  "If the scandal was about John Kerry and gay porn, that would be one thing. But John Kerry and a gay pawn? Now that's something completely different. <p>Gays and lesbians have reacted with anger to the latest twist in the US election - but not with Kerry for bringing up the subject of Vice-President Dick Cheney's lesbian daughter, Mary, during the presidential 'Duel in the Desert' in Arizona last week. </p> <p>No, gays are furious that the Cheneys are, supposedly, furious, and that the mainstream media has whipped itself up into a frenzy over the issue. </p> <p>Instead of headlines about Kerry's successful performance in the three debates and how they could project him into the White House, it's suddenly all about Mary. </p> <p>The controversy arose after the moderator in last Wednesday's TV debate asked both candidates if they thought being gay was a matter of choice or birth. President George Bush responded that he did not know the answer. His Democratic challenger said: 'We're all God's children. And I think if you were to talk to Dick Cheney's daughter, who is a lesbian, she would tell you that she's being who she was. She's being who she was born as. I think if you talk to anybody, it's not a choice.' </p> <p>Cheney is now officially quoted as an 'angry father', while his wife, Lynn, is an 'indignant mom', saying of Kerry: 'This is not a good man. What a cheap and tawdry political trick.' Kerry lost his edge again in some of the polls. </p> <p>But Cheney himself frequently mentions Mary as his 'gay daughter' on the campaign trail when he is trying to paint his party as compassionate conservatives, so being used is nothing new. </p> <p>She is a leading light in the Bush-Cheney team, came out of the closet a few years ago and has worked as an advocate for gay-friendly employment rights in big corporations. </p> <p>'The right are masters of turning people into political pawns. They invented it and now the Democrats are turning the tables. Kerry is being bold, strategically standing up for Mary, and the Republicans are shook up, that's all,' said New York TV producer and gay rights commentator Nancy Swartz. </p> <p>It is not clear if the Cheneys are angry at the politics getting personal in general or whether it is the specific public declaration of Mary's sexuality. Jane Czyzselska, editor of Diva, the UK monthly magazine for lesbians and bisexual women, has a simple theory as to why the media are so agitated. 'A lot of the mainstream media are still scared witless of gays and lesbians, and this ridiculous display of horror at the mention of Mary Cheney - gasp - THE LESBIAN, just shows it,' she said. </p> <p>Mary lives openly with her long-term girlfriend in Colorado. If Cheney does not want conservative voters reminded of that, in a kind of 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' silent-tolerance policy, then it's much too late. </p> <p>She is not the first and she will not be the last individual to be dragged into the political spotlight. It's always hard for the person and their families. When the insincerity of political preaching is exposed by the personal hypocrisy of those involved, pawns have to come into play. </p> <p>Bush is trying actively to ban gay marriage with a rare amendment to the Constitution. Neither Dick nor Mary Cheney will publicly condemn this move, with the Vice-President muttering that he loves his daughter and supports his President. Untenable? </p> <p>'He stands behind his boss and she stands behind her father. Cheney is choosing Bush over his own family, and Mary is giving up a part of her identity,' said Swartz. </p> <p>For this reason, the gay community has been officially ambivalent towards its lukewarm champion Mary Cheney. </p> <p>Meanwhile, right-wing Christians within the Republican movement call Dick Cheney's tactic the classic evangelicals' approach to awkward realities - love the sinner, hate the sin. Bush is in this camp, expounding tolerance while pushing anti-gay policies. It's the same story with racial equality. </p> <p>What Kerry did on Wednesday night was help to expose the double standards. Unfortunately for him, it backfired, and not only by sucking a couple of polling points away from what should have been his moment of glory. </p> <p>Gay men and lesbians are furious with Kerry, not for using Mary as a political pawn but for exposing his own double standards. In the same breath, Kerry spoke passionately for gay freedom and for marriage as an institution that should be enjoyed only by a man and a woman. </p> <p>Many in the gay community believe that the battle for marriage - with rebel weddings and court challenges, etc - has slowed down the campaign for equal rights on tax, employment and inheritance by goading conservatives into a backlash to defend their sacred institution. </p> <p>But the cat is out of the bag and now so is Kerry's position - he is against. But most gay voters will still choose Kerry as the lesser of two evils. </p> <p>The real tragedy is that debates and headlines in 2004 even need to be about lesbianism as an 'issue' when war, poverty, disease, dictatorship and genocide - topics that are, rightly, much higher up Kerry's priority list - are costing lives. </p> <p>If the so-called issue of Contrary Mary ends up sinking Kerry's race for the White House, that would be the true scandal.</p>",
  "The United States of America is about to reach a fork in the road, but it seems the country has not yet decided which direction to take. There is little time left for debate, nor is more needed. The American election has been in full swing all year. The deliberately truncated nature of the Democratic primaries ensured John Kerry and President George W Bush would face-off against each other from early March. It has been a long, hard-fought campaign. The war in Iraq has ensured passions on both sides would always run deep. As a result, Americans have had ample opportunity to measure Republicans and Democrats against each other. Arguments have been thrashed out, the points have been made, policies compared and contrasted. The debates have greatly helped this process. <p>Kerry has emerged from them with a renewed vigour that had once seemed to be ebbing in the face of attacks on his war record in August. Now a fuller portrait of the man has emerged. It is a picture in which there is much to admire. From behind the Republican rhetoric of a wooden elitist who chopped and changed with the political winds, Kerry has come over as surprisingly warm. His joke in the final debate that he had 'married up' with his wife, Teresa Heinz Kerry, showed a refreshing ability not to take himself too seriously. </p> <p>At the same time, Kerry has made his arguments forcefully and, unlike Bush, without too much TV-unfriendly anger. Yes, he has performed acrobatics over Iraq, but on a host of other issues, he has emerged as a man of principle seeking to engage America in the wider world. It has been a reasoned appeal to a more complex world view than the unilateralist Republicans have offered. What right-wingers have lambasted as 'flip-flopping' is, in fact, often nuance. And, in a world of increasing extremism, nuance is no bad thing. As Kerry said in the Arizona debate: 'Like Franklin Roosevelt, I don't care whether an idea is a Republican idea or a Democrat idea. I just care whether it works for America.' </p> <p>And Kerry's ideas look good not just for America but for the rest of us. Take the environment. Bush shuns the Kyoto pact on reducing emissions. Kerry also will not sign it. But he has said he favours re-opening negotiations about it. Take taxes. Bush favours making his tax cuts, which heavily favour the wealthy, permanent despite America's huge deficit. Kerry favours taking away only the cuts for those earning more than $200,000 a year. This is not Kerry as radical tax-and-spend liberal as Bush charges - this is simply reasonable. </p> <p>Take embryonic stem cell research. Bush opposes it from a position rooted in personal religious beliefs; Kerry favours allowing America's scientists to press on, perhaps to the eventual benefit of mankind. Take abortion, an issue that resonates across the world. Bush is against it. His decision is deeply influenced by his brand of born-again Christian faith and reflects the religious right in America. It has seen Bush pass legislation banning 'partial birth abortion'. </p> <p>Many Democrats believe a second Bush term will see a much wider attack. Kerry is also against abortion. He says that, as a Catholic, he cannot accept it. But, more importantly, Kerry believes his faith should never be imposed on others; he is firmly pro-choice in politics. This is heartening. America was created with a constitution that strictly separates church and state, an inspiration and model to many nations. Bush has blurred some of the edges; Kerry will maintain this vital divide. </p> <p>Take the United Nations. Many Republicans openly scorn Kerry's comments on a 'global test' for intervention. That is ridiculous. If America were directly threatened, Kerry has said he would react pre-emptively, just as Bush would. Kerry's comments were merely about wanting to persuade the world to follow America's lead, not seeking to bully it. Kerry wants to reconnect America with the wider community of nations. </p> <p>Finally, there is Iraq. Here, there is little difference between the two candidates. Whatever their thoughts on the rights and wrongs of the invasion, both candidates are committed to staying the course. That is probably the only reasonable option. </p> <p>So, with 17 days to go until voting, America is fast approaching that fork in the road. For both Americans and the rest of us, the path John Kerry would take seems brighter.</p>",
  "<p>Bill O'Reilly, the rightwing star of Rupert Murdoch's Fox News, has been accused of sexual harassment by an employee who claims that the talk-show host tried to have phone sex with her on numerous occasions. </p> <p>O'Reilly, Fox's most popular news star and a best-selling author, claims he is the target of a politically motivated, $60m (\u00a333.2m) extortion attempt by his accuser, 32-year-old Fox News producer Andrea Mackris, and her lawyer, a well-known legal bruiser, Benedict Morelli. </p> <p>Last week accuser and accused made their cases on air. O'Reilly acknowledged that his career - and the wholesome conservative reputation of Fox News - was on the line. </p> <p>But the scandal has not dampened enthusiasm for his show: ratings for The O'Reilly Factor have soared. And it has apparently had no effect on his syndicated newspaper column, which is featured in 300 publications. </p> <p>O'Reilly, who is 55 and married, has not directly denied the conversations, but has said that the lawsuit may ruin his career. 'If I have to go down, I'm willing to do it. But I've got to make a stand.' </p> <p>The case is embarrassing to Fox and to an anchor who appeals to a largely conservative audience, often lectures guests on morality, and recently wrote a book of advice for children - a fact his accuser's lawyer was quick to grasp. </p> <p>'Guys like O'Reilly who like to espouse what right-wing Republicans espouse about family values shouldn't be doing stuff like this,' Morelli said. He added: 'The man knows he did it. He finally got it through his thick skull that he did it, and he's not going to get away with it ... He's going down.' </p> <p>What O'Reilly did - according to the suit - was repeatedly proposition Mackris. In the conversations recorded by Mackris, he allegedly suggests that she buy a vibrator, boasts of teaching women to masturbate, discusses what kind of sex they should have and launches into 'a vile and degrading monologue'. </p> <p>What is potentially most damaging to O'Reilly is not that he propositioned Mackris, but the sexual details of the conversations - his Caribbean holiday shower and Scandinavian airline hostess fantasies and obsession with vibrators, one of which he allegedly uses on himself. </p> <p>For much of the conversations, O'Reilly alternates between sexual fantasies and praising his sexual - and television - performance. </p> <p>O'Reilly allegedly told Mackris that every woman owned a vibrator. Mackris insisted that she did not, and shot back: 'Does your wife?' </p> <p>'Yes, in fact she does,' O'Reilly replied, according to court papers. 'She'd kill me if she knew I was telling you.' According to the suit, O'Reilly threatened Mackris. He is alleged to have said: 'If you cross Fox News Channel, it's not just me, it's [Fox President] Roger Ailes who will go after you.' He claimed Ailes knew powerful people 'all the way to the top'. When Mackris asked, 'To the top of what?', O'Reilly replied: 'Top of the country.' </p> <p>Naturally the lawsuit has a political subtext. Morelli is a contributor to the Democratic Party and notes in the suit that Fox and O'Reilly 'preach the principles of so-called compassionate conservatism' espoused by George Bush and the Republican Party. </p> <p>O'Reilly's countersuit is alleging extortion and accuses Mackris and Morelli of trying to 'extract maximum leverage against Fox and O'Reilly right before the presidential election'. </p> <p>Comedians and talk-show hosts are having fun at O'Reilly's expense and others are enjoying the discomfort of a man who so vociferously promotes family values. </p> <p>But the publicity surrounding the case seemed to be taking its toll. </p> <p>'Two weeks ago, I had no clue my life was going to take a turn like this,' O'Reilly said. </p> <p>He said that, while the case might be hard for journalists to write about, 'it's a thousand times harder for me to sit here in my little chair and contemplate what people are saying about me'.</p>",
  "America's increasingly bitter election turned ugly yesterday amid a flurry of attacks and counter-attacks on issues ranging from the candidates' Vietnam war records to Teresa Heinz Kerry's tax returns. <p>As the race for the White House enters its final stretch, both campaigns are relentlessly on the offensive in a brutally negative campaign. The Democrats have now launched an attack against a conservative television network which is preparing to broadcast a 42-minute documentary on Kerry's protests against the Vietnam war. </p> <p>Kerry's lawyers have written to Sinclair Broadcasting to demand that its 62 stations give the Democrats the same airtime as the controversial programme. The Democrats have also complained to the Federal Communications Commission, a government broadcasting watchdog. </p> <p>The show - Stolen Honour - Wounds That Never Heal - features interviews with 17 former POWs who say Kerry's 1971 Senate testimony on US war crimes in Vietnam led to them being kept prisoner for longer. The film echoes the attacks made on Kerry's war record by a Republican-linked group, Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, which came close to derailing his campaign. </p> <p>A Sinclair spokesman said that the network has offered Kerry an interview slot after the broadcast. His campaign has turned down the offer, saying it was an attempt at a 'political set-up'. Sinclair has asked its stations to pull their regular programming to make space for the documentary which will be shown this week. The move has many Democrats worried because Sinclair broadcasts in several key swing states. </p> <p>However, new controversy has emerged over George W. Bush's Vietnam service as a pilot in the National Guard after 31 new pages of documents surfaced yesterday, two weeks after National Guard officials had signed legal oaths swearing they had turned over all the President's records. Bush has been criticised for poor attendance, losing his flight status and failing to show up at all for a long period of his service before leaving early to go to business school. A National Guard spokesman said the new discovery was simply a matter of the poor state of the records. </p> <p>At the same time ketchup heiress Teresa Heinz Kerry released a series of documents detailing her tax returns. Republican campaigners have been demanding for months that she reveal her contributions, though candidates' wives are under no obligation to do so. The records showed that she paid a federal tax rate of about 12.5 per cent on income of about $5 million. Republican operatives are keen to make such huge wealth an issue in the campaign and frequently refer to her multiple houses and enormous fortune. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the candidates campaigned in key swing states. Bush was in Florida, which decided the result in 2000, and Kerry in Ohio, seen as perhaps the most vital this year. </p> <p>Polls show Bush with a narrow lead, blunting a recent Democrat surge in the wake of Bush's poor performances in the presidential debates. A study from top polling firm Zogby International showed Bush leading Kerry 48 per cent to 44. However, the Rasmussen tracking poll has Bush with just a two-point lead, 48 per cent to 46, and a Washington Post study released on Friday had the candidates at 48 per cent each.</p>",
  "<p><strong>The Hornet's Nest</strong><br>by Jimmy Carter<br>Simon and Schuster \u00a317.99, pp480</p> <p>JImmy Carter is a great man who achieved greatness only after the carnival left town, a statesman revered for wisdom only when his power had drained away. The greatest living ex-President of the United States? There's not much competition, unless you like chewing gum with Gerald Ford or chewing the fat with Papa Bush. But Carter's industry, honesty and unflagging niceness make an unassailable case. Nothing has so become him as the rest of his life.</p> <p>Yet you can, alas, have too much of a good thing, maybe 480 or so pages too much. We know Carter the submarine officer, nuclear engineer, peanut farmer, governor, commander in chief, Nobel peacemaker and global democracy monitor well enough. We may even have read some of his previous 16 books: the memoirs, histories, poems and children's stories. But a novel... this novel?</p> <p>For the truth is that Carter has produced the worst of all offerings - an unreadable book, one which leaves other unreadables (like The Da Vinci Code) floundering in his lumpen wake.</p> <p>Is it the story he has to unfold, of how the War of Independence bubbled and boiled, for 20 years, through Georgia, Florida and the Carolinas? No; that's promising enough. Off go two sons of a Philadelphia shoemaker to seek their fortunes in frontier country. Henry gets killed early on, but Ethan and his Epsey, along with Kindred and his Mavis, ride the tides of war across the South. There's enough material here - pretty fresh if you don't know your Dixie - to mould into gripping adventure.</p> <p>It isn't the outline or ambition of the plot which makes The Hornet's Nest far less than the bee's knees, though; it's the pacing (slow-slow-slower-quick) and the telling. The author the dust jacket insists on calling President Carter is such a detail freak that every new character comes fully kitted in adjectival anoraks.</p> <p>So Elijah Clarke, for typical instance, 'had thick black hair cut about even with the lobes of his ears. His eyes were surprisingly large but squinted often as he talked. His aquiline nose and somewhat protruding chin have an impression of strength to a short upper lip and a soft-looking mouth. He had prominent yellowed teeth...' The surface descriptions run on and on.</p> <p>Worse, so do the little interpolated lectures which recall Jimmy's other brief career as a Sunday school teacher. Please, sir, what's the difference between a Whig and a Tory? And the whole class has to sit very quiet while he tells you, at length.</p> <p>Then there's the dialogue, the bits between inverted commas which all read the same whoever's talking. When Indian chiefs meet to discuss the state of their world, they say: 'There is little doubt that continuing warfare is against our best interests', rather as though they were Norwegian diplomats trying to resuscitate the Oslo accords.</p> <p>When a very young Indian reports political developments, he seems to be auditioning for a Washington Post column. Apparently, 'John Stuart is not involved in this proposal and may even disapprove if questioned directly, but has been aware for many months of the Creeks who have co-operated with the Rangers. Increasingly, Governor Tonyn is making overall decisions as Stuart has become relatively inactive and somewhat isolated in Pensacola from the contested frontier areas...'</p> <p>Enough! It's not fair. Someone at S&amp;S should have saved Carter from himself, and curiosity corner. He doesn't deserve this perverse profile in courage. The great man has moral authority. He was better than Kerry or Clinton when he tackled Iraq at this year's Boston convention. He was valiant for truth when he gave the Venezuela election a clean bill of health. He's a continuing good deed in a bad world. He deserves our admiration.</p> <p>Maybe future historians will write interminable theses on this novel as artefact and store them in the Carter memorial library. Maybe his obsession with detail is part of a much deeper Carter condition. Maybe what one American critic calls his 'exalted ambivalencies' are also the curse of Kerry. But meanwhile, let's get back to the Middle East, Bosnia or Port-au-Prince. Something he and we can start and one day finish.</p>"
