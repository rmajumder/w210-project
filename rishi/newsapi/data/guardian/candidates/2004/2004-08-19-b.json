  "The French government returned from its summer break yesterday publicly determined to persevere with an unpopular programme of social and economic reforms, but privately transfixed by the question of who will lead the ruling centre-right UMP party. <p>After the first cabinet meeting of the new parliamentary year, the cabinet's spokesman, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Cop\u00e9, said the government's responsibility was \"action ... not the interior life of political parties.\" </p> <p>Asked whether the occasion had been marred by tension between President Jacques Chirac, who chairs the weekly meetings, and his increasingly powerful rival, the ambitious young finance minister Nicolas Sarkozy, all maintained a diplomatic silence. </p> <p>Mr Sarkozy, certain to seek France's top job in the 2007 presidential election, has not yet formally declared his desire to take over from Alain Jupp\u00e9, long Mr Chirac's preferred successor at the Elys\u00e9e palace, as head of the party. </p> <p>But he spent his summer holiday energetically building mass cross-party support in readiness for the November elections, and most observers expect him to announce his candidacy for the post, which controls the cash and other party resources necessary for a successful presidential bid, at the end of the month. </p> <p>Even confirmed Chirac loyalists like the environment minister Roselyne Bachelot now seem convinced that the president's most feared enemy will win the UMP leadership by a crushing majority this autumn. </p> <p>\"Nicolas Sarkozy is quite plainly the man the grassroots members want,\" Ms Bachelot said. </p> <p>\"If he doesn't run, it will be a big disappointment for them. He is the best candidate. There's no question.\" </p> <p>The government's immediate priorities are to agree cuts in the 2005 budget to freeze state spending year-on-year, and to slash unemployment by a vast \"social cohesion plan\". </p> <p>Heavily punished in the regional and European elections this year for its reforms to state pensions and the health service, it aims to push through equally controversial reforms in the civil service and in education. </p> <p>Besides the prospect of continued and mounting public resistance to its policies, it will also have to deal with the consequences of Mr Sarkozy's likely appointment as UMP leader. </p> <p>Mr Chirac, who cordially detests his rival and would consider his election as president in 2007 a personal defeat, has decreed that no one can combine a cabinet portfolio with leadership of the UMP. </p> <p>At the very best Mr Raffarin's government can expect a big reshuffle if Mr Sarkozy decides to abide by Mr Chirac's rule. </p> <p>At worst, observers say, it could face open warfare and a catastrophic split in the governing party. </p> <p>\"The coming weeks will be tumultuous whatever happens, and will mark the start of a new political era,\" said one analyst, Pierre Joigny. </p> <p>\"No matter what ministers say about getting on with their jobs, their minds will be elsewhere.\"</p>",
  "Three weeks after surviving an assassination attempt, Pakistan's finance minister, Shaukat Aziz, confirmed his place as the country's next prime minister, after coasting to victory in a byelection. <p>Mr Aziz, 55, an urban former Citibank executive, trounced his opponents with up to 10 times more votes. But during campaigning it was his physical, not political, survival that was at stake. </p> <p>As his motorcade passed through rural Punjab on July 30, a suicide bomber blew himself up, killing Mr Aziz's driver and eight others. Mr Aziz escaped unhurt, but the incident underscored how Pakistan has moved into the crosshairs of the war on terror in recent months. </p> <p>Both the government and Islamist extremists are playing tough. President Pervez Musharraf, a key US ally, has arrested more than 60 al-Qaida suspects this summer. In turn, the militants have targeted the country's ruling elite. </p> <p>A month before the attempt to kill Mr Aziz, apparently for his US connections, a senior army commander was nearly killed in June. </p> <p>\"One of our blessed battalions tried to hunt the head of one of America's infidels,\" the previously unknown Istambouli Brigade of al-Qaida declared in an internet statement. \"But God wanted him to survive.\" </p> <p>Pakistan's Human Rights Commission yesterday expressed \"immense concern\" that an Islamist cleric arrested in connection with the attack had died during interrogation over his alleged al-Qaida links. </p> <p>Qari Noor Muhammad had been arrested in a raid on a seminary in the eastern city of Faisalbad last week. Police claimed he suffered a heart attack, but the human rights watchdog said his body was covered in cuts and bruises caused by torture. </p> <p>Mr Aziz returned to Pakistan from New York in 1999 after a 30-year career with Citibank. Since then he has helped to swing Pakistan's ailing economy around, delivering a 6% growth rate this year. </p> <p>Since the July 30 attack, he has rarely ventured into public and has declined all interviews. However, he is due to return to the spotlight next week with announcement of a new cabinet. </p> <p>He is expected to be a more dynamic prime minister than his predecessor, Zafarullah Jamali, who resigned in June. </p> <p>But while economic pundits hailed Mr Aziz's pending appointment, political analysts said the manner of his election was another black mark against Pakistan's authoritarian brand of democracy. He was handpicked for the job by President Musharraf - a choice which yesterday's byelection result only rubber-stamped. </p> <p>\"It was more of a selection than an election,\" said Samina Ahmed, the South Asia director of the International Crisis Group thinktank. </p> <p>Even though Mr Musharraf restored parliament two years ago, the military still wields ultimate power in Pakistan. </p> <p>Mr Jamali is though to have fallen out with Mr Musharraf after he suggested that the president should stick to his promise to resign as the army chief of staff by the end of this year - a move observers view as increasingly unlikely.</p>",
  "Ariel Sharon, the Israeli prime minister, yesterday vowed to press ahead with his plan to withdraw Gaza's Jewish settlements, despite his defeat at the hands of his own party on Wednesday. <p>A statement from his office said: \"The prime minister is continuing with the disengagement and the diplomatic process. He will find a solution to the problem. He will try to build a stable coalition government.\" </p> <p>On Wednesday, the Likud central committee voted on a resolution that barred Mr Sharon, who is on holiday, from asking the Labour party to join his coalition government. Committee members believe Mr Sharon will use the Labour party to outflank his own party in implementing the disengagement plan, which they rejected in May. </p> <p>The prime minister is not bound by the decisions of the central committee and is still supported by the majority of the party's Knesset members. </p> <p>But senior members of the Labour party said they should pull out of coalition negotiations because Mr Sharon had become a \"lame duck prime minister\" and call for early elections. </p> <p>Under Israeli law, the president must consider if there is another candidate who might stand a better chance of creating a coalition. Mr Sharon is unlikely to give his rival, Binyamin Netanyahu, such an opportunity. </p> <p>A second scenario is the failure of the Knesset to pass the budget within a certain period of time. If that occurs, the president is obliged to call an early election. </p> <p>Mr Sharon received some good news yesterday when the supreme court backed the decision of the attorney general not to prosecute him on corruption charges. The prime minister was investigated for giving political favours to a man who then gave his son large sums of money for a very small amount of work, but the attorney general decided that there was not enough evidence to continue the inquiry. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Palestinian militants fired five homemade rockets from the Gaza Strip at the Israeli town of Sderot yesterday, wounding a 10-year-old boy, Israeli rescue workers said. More than 30 other people were treated for shock. </p> <p>Israeli soldiers shot dead an 18-year-old Palestinian in the Gaza Strip town of Rafah, witnesses and hospital officials said. Two other Palestinians were wounded.</p>",
  "<p>Ten summers ago, when Old Labour's John Prescott was about to become deputy to the very New Labour Tony Blair, I put in a rare phone call to the Sussex farm of the party's last prime minister, Lord Callaghan. </p> <p>Why? Partly because by the mid-1970s Jim Callaghan had rated the trade union militant-turned-MP, a man who had helped disrupt his own chancellorship a decade earlier, sufficiently highly to offer him the job that Peter Mandelson has just landed, as a British European commissioner. </p> <p>But also because \"Sunny Jim\" had witnessed at close quarters the talent and the tantrums of George Brown, another working-class boy made good in Labour's ranks; one who had become deputy prime minister under Harold Wilson but walked out in a huff in the 1968 (he was foreign secretary at the time), a victim of the booze and his own thin-skinned, volatile temperament. </p> <p>Which was the better bet, I asked Callaghan, Brown or Prescott? \"Prescott,\" he replied without hesitation. \"More disciplined.\" When reminded of this prediction this week, the 92-year-old chuckled and said: \"I'm sorry but I don't talk business on the phone any more.\" Yet there is no disputing that he had been right. </p> <p>It has been touch and go at times, all the same. The Prescott who helped pull a canoeist out of a swirling Welsh river and visited the flash-flood devastation in Boscastle this week (\"John was ridiculed about global warming, but it's coming home to roost,\" says his old friend, the sports minister, Dick Caborn) is still capable of bad-tempered outbursts. Occasionally he still thumps a voter. </p> <p>But he has been here, there and pretty well everywhere by now. As the ex-Bennite deputy leader who helped deliver Blair's symbolic 1996 reform of Labour's sacred clause four - despite his own misgivings - he got the upgrade to deputy PM in 1997. Heading up huge swaths of policy reform, travelling the world as Tony's emissary, Prescott has stayed the course: 66 and still standing. When Blair is away, he is the man in charge. Like Billy Elliot - he saw the film five times - he has beaten the odds and made it. </p> <p>Little wonder that there is now a mellow self-confidence that was not there before. Last winter an architectural writer for the Times came away impressed with Prescott's enthusiasm for cutting-edge design and sustainable communities, though the DPM has since managed to fall out with both traditionalist architects and Lord Rogers - a bit of a moaner, he says. </p> <p>Wind farms - which Green Prescott encourages with gusto - give the countryside lobby additional cause for rage, on top of the arm-twisting he has inflicted on local authorities across southern Britain to build many more homes than they want to build. </p> <p>\"We like him personally as a bluff, blundering creature in British politics. But his decisions are massively damaging, particularly in planning and the environment. He's been a catastrophe,\" says Alan Duncan, who clashes with the DPM as Tory constitutional affairs spokesman, but also suffers plans for wind farms and over-enlarged villages in his Rutland and Melton constituency. </p> <p>If a politician can be judged by his enemies, then Prescott is still proper Labour, though the Fire Brigades Union, which felt the lash of his stubborn tongue during its bitter pay dispute, no longer loves him. Nor does the former merchant seaman's own union, the RMT, which he quit when its new left leadership broke ranks with Labour. He now belongs to Amicus. \"I was born a union man and I will die a union man,\" he says. </p> <p>What does this amount to in terms of achievement as Labour heads into the next election and Prescott faces the prospect of giving up at least some of the power he relishes? In policy terms it is a mixed bag. In 1997 Prescott insisted on an impossibly large department, the environment, transport and the regions. He loved them all, but it was too much for anyone and was broken up. </p> <p>He still has the local government hot potato, housing and planning, urban regeneration and social exclusion, as well as his regions - where he beat a tactical retreat last month. Faced with voter rejection of his regional assemblies for Yorkshire and the north-west he dropped two of the three promised referendums. </p> <p>Given his portfolio, the poor municipal record of his constituency home base of Hull must be reckoned a blot on the Prescott CV. But it is his hopes of an integrated transport policy that have proved most naively optimistic. When he set them out he was deemed \"anti-car\" by those he dismisses as the policy teenyboppers in Downing Street - a bit hard on a Jag-lover. </p> <p>But Blair decreed that transport was not a priority. Voters were attached to their cars. And the scale of under-investment in track maintenance since the botched Tory privatisation was only fully understood after the disasters at Paddington and Hatfield. Labour transport budgets are now distorted by the need to catch up. </p> <p>Yet if public-private partnerships to rebuild public infrastructure have also proved a costly and at times disappointing alternative then Prescott the policy wonk is as much to blame as Blair or Gordon Brown. </p> <p>He was writing policy pamphlets as opposition transport spokesman 20 years ago - and he still believes in PPP. Schools, hospitals, even roads and Channel tunnel links (he patched up the deal that rescued the line through Kent) would not have been there without them. That is the pragmatic Prescott at work - partnership with capital on mutually advantageous terms - the conclusion of a rank-and-file leftwinger who used to share a London flat with Dennis Skinner and, unlike Skinner, didn't mind \"getting shitty hands\" to get things done in office. </p> <p>Skinner too has mellowed and is often more supportive of Blair than Islington radicals who have never lifted anything heavier than a quiche. But the Bolsover MP keeps his wary distance. Prescott is long past that stage. And it is his role as keeper of the peace between Blair and Brown that has added significance to the DPM's late career. </p> <p>Anthony Seldon, Blair's latest biographer, quotes Prescott as saying: \"I'm not going to read that fucking New Labour crap,\" when asked to deliver a Blair speech in 1998. But he has swallowed a lot of the crap in the intervening years, with dignity and grace in what he judges to be the interests of his party. </p> <p>Caborn explains it thus: \"John acknowledges that he owes everything to the Labour party. He's not in it for himself. The only thing he's ever wanted to do is make sure Labour is in power and delivering things for people because the only way you can change society is through politics. Anyone who jeopardises that and starts taking Labour out of power will get the biggest belting from John. He believes the party is above personalities.\" </p> <p>It is not difficult to read that as an indictment of less disciplined colleagues from Ken Livingstone to Clare Short. They would almost certainly reply that Prescott has indulged Blair too much. Others would argue that, in coming to terms with Brown in recent years (they clashed badly long ago), it is the chancellor he has overindulged - until the open Blair-Brown spat last autumn threatened to jeopardise them all. </p> <p>What is not in dispute is that a mutually regarding intimacy has gradually developed between the public school barrister in No 10 and the militant seafarer. Rosie Winterton, junior health minister and another Prescottite, calls it \"a political partnership\" rather than a personal one. \"Admiration and understanding has grown between them during what has been Labour's most successful administration.\" </p> <p>Even Mandelson, with whom Prescott has always had a tricky relationship, has been heard to praise the DPM's role as \"our Willie Whitelaw\", the loyal deputy beyond personal ambition who shores up - and restrains - his leader, as the gallant Tory squire once did Margaret Thatcher. High praise of its kind, though in both partnerships there was never any chance of them going on holiday together. Blair reads and plays tennis, Prescott unwinds by watching TV. </p> <p>What next? Prescott still bridles at the minor public school snobbery of his media tormentors - yesterday's Daily Mail providing another example - but has been encouraged by Blair to shrug it off. Last month he handled a stint of PM's question time, long a Commons torment, with aplomb. </p> <p>This week Mellow Prescott gave way to Furious Prescott again after press reports that he is \"bed-blocking\" the Straws and Blunketts who want his job. His enthusiasm remains undimmed. Whatever happens after the election he will probably stay on as (elected) deputy leader. When the time comes for Blair to stand aside he will back Brown. But, apart from the occasional hint about the party's shifting \"tectonic plates\", Prescott is too canny to show his hand. </p> <p>You do not get from 11-plus failure to deputy PM by being as daft as the Mail keeps telling itself he is. As Mrs Thatcher observed, \"every prime minister needs a Willie\". </p> <p><strong>Life in short</strong></p> <p><strong> Born </strong> May 31 1938 in Prestatyn, son of the late John Herbert Prescott, JP, and Phyllis Prescott </p> <p><strong> Family</strong> married 1961, Pauline Tilston; two sons </p> <p><strong> Education</strong> Grange secondary modern, Ellesmere Port; Ruskin College, Oxford; Hull University (BSc Economics) </p> <p><strong> Career</strong> joined Labour party 1956; former trainee chef and merchant seaman (NUS official 1968-70); parliamentary candidate (Lab) Southport 1966; MP (Lab) Kingston-upon-Hull East 1970-; delegate Council of Europe 1973-75, PPS to secretary of state for trade 1974-76; leader Labour party delegation European parliament 1976-79 (member 1975-79); opposition spokesman 1979-94; deputy leader Labour party 1994-; deputy PM 1997-, secretary of state for the environment, transport and the regions 1997-2001, first secretary of state 2001- (responsible for local government and the regions since 2002)</p>",
  "So George Monbiot wants us Americans to vote for Nader again in hopes of sparking a democratic revolution (The bad or the terrible? August 17). I've been an ex-pat for 25 years and it's been a long time since I voted in a US election. It's different this year. We are not faced with the anodyne choice of managerial styles as in the UK. It is much more akin to the choice of the French in 2002 between business as usual and crypto-fascists. <p>Monbiot wrote four years ago (August 16 2000): \"The only hope for both America and us is that George Bush wins.\" Four years later, democracy in the US and the world is threatened. Defeating Bush will be a step back from a nightmare.<br> <b>Larry Boyd</b><br> Wickham, Hants </p> <p>George Monbiot underes-timates the seriousness of the conservative \"revolution\" that Bush has started. Kerry is \"not good\" rather than \"bad\" and leaves room for hope and further action. It is called leverage. This unfortunate dilemma shows again how dreadful it is to be trapped in a two-party system and in the binary, non-dialectic thinking it induces. We are grateful that France, for the moment, has been spared such a tragic simplification of political thinking. But barely, and for how long?<br> <b>Laurent Sauerwein</b><br> American University of Paris </p> <p>While my heart tells me it is right to advise progressives to vote with their conscience, my head tells me that if the advice were followed, Bush would be assured of a victory that would be perceived as massive popular endorsement.<br> <b>Mark Prosser</b><br> R\u00fcfenacht, Switzerland<br></p>",
  "<p>In recent years the US electorate has become highly polarised. Large contiguous regions of the country (the red states) favour the Republicans, other large contiguous regions favour the Democrats (the blue states), and relatively small regions in between (which we might label purple) constitute the so-called battleground states. </p> <p>There are many reasons for this dichotomy, but some light may be shed by an abstract model introduced in 1999 by Joshua Epstein of the Brookings Institution (Learning to be Thoughtless: Social Norms and Individual Computation). </p> <p>Imagine that around a big circle are millions of people who are asked daily whether they intend to vote for George Bush or John Kerry. Assume that they have an initial favourite, randomly choosing Bush or Kerry, but that they are very conformist and decide daily to consult some of their immediate neighbours. After polling those on either side of them, they adjust their vote to conform with that of the majority of their neighbours. </p> <p>How many people each voter consults varies from day to day and is determined by the fact that they are \"lazy statisticians\". They expand their samples of adjacent voters only as much as necessary, wishing always to conform with minimum exertion. </p> <p>There are various ways to model this general idea, but let's assume the following specific rule. If one day a voter, say Henry, polls the X people on either side of him, the next day he expands his sample to the X+1 people on either side of him. If the percentage favouring the two candidates in this expanded sample is different than it is when he polls only the X people on either side of him, he expands his sample still further. </p> <p>On the other hand, if the percentage favouring the two candidates is the same in the expanded sample as it is when he polls only the X people on either side of him, Henry decides he may be working too hard. In this case he reduces his sample to the X-1 people on either side of him. If the percentage favouring the candidates is the same in this smaller sample, he reduces that sample further. </p> <p>Every voter updates his or her favourite daily and interacts with other voters according to these same rules. (At the cost of complicating the model we can allow voters to consult an acquaintance network rather than only their immediate physical neighbours.) </p> <p>Epstein's model showed that the result of all this consulting is a little surprising. After several days of this sequential updating of votes, there are long arcs of solid Bush voters and long arcs of solid Kerry voters and, between them, small arcs of very mixed voters. After a short while, voters in the solid arcs need consult only their immediate neighbours to decide how to vote and almost never change their votes. Voters between the solid arcs need to consult many people on either side of them and change their vote quite frequently. </p> <p>Although Epstein applied his model to more automatically followed social norms, the idea of extending it to voting is seductive. People do tend to surround themselves with others of like mind and generally only those at the borders between partisans, the so-called swing voters, are open to much change. His major point is that social norms, often a result of nothing more than propinquity, make it unnecessary to think much - about what to wear, which side of the road to drive on, when to eat, etc. </p> <p>To the considerable extent that voting is - for many - an unthinking emulation of those with whom they associate, the model helps explain the near uniformity of their friends' political opinions. (Rush Limbaugh's depressingly telling phrase \"ditto heads\" applies to many on both sides of the political spectrum.) </p> <p>When there's some sort of shock to the system, Epstein's model suggests something else rather interesting. If a large number of voters change their vote suddenly for some reason (say, a terrorist attack or environmental catastrophe), the changed voter preferences soon settle down to a new equilibrium just as stable with solid Bush, solid Kerry, and mixed border areas, but located at different places around the circle. The model thus shows how political allegiances can sometimes change suddenly, but then settle quickly into a new and different segmentation just as rigidly adhered to as the old. </p> <p>In any case, unless there is some cataclysmic change in the presidential race, the crucial races are those in Ohio, Florida, and the relatively few other contested purple states. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> John Allen Paulos is a professor of mathematics at Temple University, Philadelphia, and bestselling author of Innumeracy and A Mathematician Plays the Stock Market. <a href=\"http://www.math.temple.edu/paulos\">www.math.temple.edu/paulos</a></p>",
  "Before attending a rally to hear vice president Dick Cheney, citizens in New Mexico were required to sign a political loyalty oath approved by the Republican national committee. \"I, [full name] ... do herby [sic] endorse George W Bush for reelection of the United States.\" The form noted: \"In signing the above endorsement you are consenting to use and release of your name by Bush-Cheney as an endorser of President Bush.\" <p>Bush is campaigning at events billed as Ask President Bush. Only supporters are allowed in. Talking points are distributed to questioners. In Traverse City, Michigan, a 55-year-old social studies teacher who wore a Kerry sticker had her ticket torn up at the door. \"How can anyone in the US deny someone entry?\" she asked. \"Isn't this a democracy?\" </p> <p>At every rally, Bush repeats the same speech, touting a \"vibrant economy\" and his leadership in a war where \"you cannot show weakness\". He introduces local entrepreneurs who praise his tax cuts. (More than one million jobs have been lost in his term.) Then Bush calls on questioners. More than one-fifth of them profess their evangelical faith or denounce gay marriage. In Niceville, Florida, one said: \"This is the very first time that I have felt that God was in the White House.\" \"Thank you,\" replied Bush. Another: \"Mr President, as a child, how can I help you get votes?\" In Albuquerque, he was told: \"It's an honour every day when I get to pray for you as president.\" And this one: \"Thank God we finally have a commander-in-chief.\" Others repeat attack lines on John Kerry's military record to which Bush responds with an oblique but encouraging \"Thanks\". </p> <p>Bush's overriding strategy is to bolster his credentials as a decisive military figure and to impugn his opponent's manhood. In his latest TV commercial, he says: \"We cannot hesitate, we cannot yield, we must do everything in our power to bring an enemy to justice before they hurt us again.\" But, according to the Washington Post, for the last two years he has uttered the elusive Osama bin Laden's name only 10 times, and \"on six of those occasions it was because he was asked a direct question ... Not once during that period has he talked about Bin Laden at any length, or said anything substantive\". At Ask President Bush events, he mentions 9/11 only to raise the threat of Saddam. </p> <p>Vice president Cheney sneered at Kerry for even using the word \"sensitive\" with respect to counter-terrorism. Not one war was \"won by being sensitive\", mocked Cheney. Kerry, in fact, had called for fighting \"a more effective, more thoughtful, more strategic, more proactive, more sensitive war on terror that reaches out to other nations and brings them to our side and lives up to American values in history\". Cheney's distortion is calculated to attempt to portray Kerry as somehow effeminate. </p> <p>At the same time, a Republican front group of Vietnam veterans financed by a major Bush contributor is running an ad campaign claiming Kerry's account of his military record is false. But not one of these veterans served with him on his boat. </p> <p>During the Vietnam war, Bush famously used his father's connections to get a posting as a pilot in the Texas Air National Guard because it was filled with the sons of privilege. After refusing to submit to a routine drug test, he was suspended and never flew again. He got himself transferred to the Alabama National Guard, but didn't turn up for his tour of duty. Since then, he has withheld his full military records. Now he encourages smears that a genuine war hero has lied about his service and is a coward. But this is more than a case of projection. The more profound issue is not who served in Vietnam and who dodged. It is whether the president is a sovereign. </p> <p>Since the birth of the US party system, presidential candidates have gone directly to the sovereign people to make their case. After the Democratic convention, Kerry travelled from New England to the northwest doing just that. Not one of the hundreds of thousands who attended his open-air rallies had to pledge allegiance to him, and he encountered organised Bush hecklers as part of the price. At his rallies Bush is a pseudo-populist. But these controlled environments reflect his deeper view of the presidency as sovereign, preempting democracy. </p> <p>Floundering in the polls, without a strategy for Iraq, unwilling to say the name of Bin Laden, he is secure in the knowledge that the cheering multitudes have been selected. Ask President Bush has crystallised the underlying issue, framed succinctly by the greatest American poet of democracy, Walt Whitman, who wrote: \"The President is there in the White House for you, it is not you who are here for him.\" </p> <p> Sidney Blumenthal, a former senior adviser to President Clinton, is Washington bureau chief of <a href=\"http://www.salon.com\">salon.com</a> </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:sidney_blumenthal@yahoo.com\">sidney_blumenthal@yahoo.com</a></p>",
  "This has been a summer of reflection. Before the August break, I had been involved in a furious argument - well, several - about the Dear Leader. On these pages I'd argued it was time for Tony Blair to bow out. Good friends were appalled. Excellent ministers, who have helped improve this country greatly over the past seven years, let me have it with both barrels. Others phoned up with pained advice to think again. Don't let the frenzied silliness of July at Westminster get to you, they said. <p>So I have been rethinking. No one seriously interested in the centre-left can be immune to the pro-Blair case, from two landslide election victories to the subsequent successes in the fight against child poverty, the minimum wage, and the utter baffling of that once-mighty force, Tory Britain. Nor can we lightly dismiss those twin ancient sins of the left, oppositionism and division. </p> <p>Oppositionism, that rancid loathing for every aspect of power, even Labour power, is an ugly creature: this remains a government full of decent people doing their best. Their motives are good. Many of their achievements are real. Division has scarred the left throughout its history and kept it well away from power. I'm not even entirely immune from the personal Blair case. He remains a charming, impeccably polite, good-natured and amazingly resilient man. </p> <p>Armed with these thoughts and a heavy bag's worth of political reading, the summer crop of Blair biographies, books about Blair's war, Blair's spin doctor, Blair's friend George W, I've been reconsidering. We are not so far from a general election; I have no desire to do the Tories' work for them. Isn't it time to forget the doubts and get behind Tony? </p> <p>Here are a few thoughts it's hard to argue against. First, we are not looking over the precipice to a Tory victory. After the early euphoria of Michael Howard's Commons performances, the Conservatives have failed to move in the polls or to break through in real elections, and are now slumped in listless fatalism. The only time you can get Tories to show real enthusiasm is when they are discussing the leadership battle after the election. Campaign teams are already being put in place. </p> <p>Second, the Labour movement is not a leadership cult. There is a big difference between criticising the current prime minister and leftist factionalism of the old sort. The days of Trots taking over constituency Labour parties did Labour no good. But to pretend that criticising Blair is somehow equivalent strikes me as barmy. Labour needs its free speech, its outspokenness, its arguments, or it isn't a living party at all, merely an electoral machine, oiled with the baubles of office. </p> <p>Third, while it is true that these two New Labour governments have achieved a great deal, a high proportion of that achievement has not come from the prime minister. The remaking of monetary policy; the minimum wage; extra help for poorer working families; the tax rises to pay for a big increase in health spending; devolution for Scotland and Wales; the blitz on unemployment and the concentration on child poverty all originated with the Treasury team, or crusading departmental ministers, or were inherited from John Smith. </p> <p>In traditional parliamentary politics, this would have been unsurprising. It's actually healthy. It's just that we have evolved such a grotesquely leader-focused political culture - one whipped up by the Alastair Campbells of this world - that the discrepancy between the government's domestic achievements (great) and the personal achievements of the prime minister (dubious) seems embarrassing. In other words, to criticise Blair is not to criticise \"his\" government. </p> <p>Blair has his No 10 graph-drawers such as Sir Michael Barber. He is no doubt keen to keep on top of what is happening, from crime to asylum, from the economy to statistics on cancer survival. And he shows an impressive grasp of the numbers. But the ideas came from elsewhere and so does much of the energy. In recent years No 10 has lost its thinkers and its Labour progressives, and has not recruited any more. </p> <p>Instead it has reshaped itself around the prime minister's interests and instincts which are, for the most part, looking towards the world stage. His greatest domestic achievement, in the sense of a policy breakthrough that was down to his own attention and obsessive working, was the Northern Ireland peace process. Following on from that, he has pursued diplomacy and deal-brokering everywhere from the Balkans to Brussels, Washington to Baghdad. It is one of the things he is very good at. </p> <p>Which leads me to the reason I found myself arguing so furiously against him to start with. He has enthusiastically aligned himself with every rightwing force he can find in the world. George Bush is not just a Republican president, but the representative of a tight cluster of big-oil, anti-environmental, tax-cuts-for-the-rich politicians and tycoons. They have shown contempt for Europe, and for global institutions, and seem to see the world as a playground for the projection of America's awesome force. </p> <p>In the Middle East the Iraq war has not produced either stability or democracy. Iraq itself remains a bloodbath. Saudi Arabia is more volatile than ever, and in Israel, Ariel Sharon has just again shown his contempt for the road map. Terrorism is being desperately contained, so far, by western security services but, as Islamic disaffection spreads, only just. </p> <p>Washington's allies are now a strange group of rightwing European leaders, and Blair follows suit. Here's a thought experiment: imagine him taking a holiday with Jacques Chirac. Impossible, isn't it? Blair has isolated himself, not simply on the Sardinian coast with the odious Silvio Berlusconi, but from the European mainstream. </p> <p>Even those loyalists who argue for a \"better Blair\" must have had their optimism shaken by this summer's events: the appointment of Labour's least-favourite politician, Peter Mandelson, to a plum job, followed by those pictures of the Blairs cavorting with Berlusconi. We are, it appears, getting an even worse Blair than before, who delights in deriding his party. </p> <p>Moreover, this Blair is not, despite what his people tell you, the only Labour man who can win an election. Poll after poll has shown that Gordon Brown would win a bigger majority than Blair. </p> <p>Here is the truth I cannot get away from. Blair isn't one of ours. His career as a Labour prime minister has been an exhilarating, infuriating, sometimes hilarious accident. He belongs with them, the people he wants to belong with - the rightwing politicians, the Republican proconsuls, the Italian aristocrats, the global media tycoons. He is at least honest enough to make no pretence about it. As the Irish say, fair play to him. But the result of my rethinking? My good, loyal, hard-working Labour friends - you should reflect a bit yourselves. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:jackie.ashley@theguardian.com\">jackie.ashley@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Reporters looking into the background of the Vietnam veteran who claimed John Kerry lied about a key military engagement have discovered that his own metal citation backs up Mr Kerry's version of events. <p>Larry Thurlow has been a vocal critic of the Democratic presidential candidate, and in an attack ad paid for by supporters of the president, George Bush, he claimed Mr Kerry was not under enemy fire during an engagement for which both men were awarded the bronze star. </p> <p>Mr Thurlow and Mr Kerry were both navy swift boat captains engaged in the same mission into the Viet Cong-controlled territory on the Mekong Delta on March 13 1969. During the mission, a mine exploded under one of the boats in the flotilla, and a second explosion knocked special forces officer Jim Rassman into the water. </p> <p>Wounded himself, Mr Kerry reached into the water and pulled Mr Rassman to safety. Both he and Mr Rassman maintain they were under enemy fire during the incident, and to this day Mr Rassman credits Mr Kerry with saving his life. </p> <p>Mr Thurlow has loudly insisted that he never heard enemy fire during the incident and that Mr Kerry was lying for his political gain. However Mr Thurlow's own bronze star citation, obtained under Freedom of Information legislation by reporters at the Washington Post, stated decisively that he was under enemy fire that day on the river with Mr Kerry.</p> <p>The citation contains several references to \"enemy small arms and automatic weapons fire\" directed at \"all units\" of the five-boat flotilla. It goes on to praise Mr Thurlow for providing assistance to a damaged swift boat \"despite enemy bullets flying about him.\" Today Mr Kerry called on the White House to condemn criticism of his Vietnam War record, and released a television commercial to promote his version of events. </p> <p>\"All those Viet Cong were shooting at me. I expected to be shot. When he pulled me out of the river, he risked his life to save mine,\" Mr Rassmann says in the 30-second commercial. </p> <p>The White House has refused to call on backers of the attack ads to stop running them. </p> <p>In a prepared remark to firefighters today, Mr Kerry said: \"More than 30 years ago I learned an important lesson. When you're under attack the best thing to do is turn your boat into the attack. That's what I intend to do today.\" </p> <p>Kerry's campaign also arranged to have several members of the navy swift boat crew attend the speech to firefighters. </p> <p>Mr Thurlow is a leading member of Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, an anti-Kerry group of Vietnam veterans. He has described Mr Kerry's bronze star citation as \"totally fabricated\" saying, \"I never heard a shot.\" </p> <p>Mr Thurlow, a registered Republican, said he was angry with Mr Kerry for his anti-war activities after his return to the US, especially his claim that US troops committed war crimes with the knowledge of their officers up the chain of command. </p> <p>Members of Mr Kerry's crew have said the Democrat is telling the truth. Mr Rassmann said he has vivid memories of enemies firing at him from both banks.</p> <p>Senior Democrats, including some inside the campaign, have urged Mr Kerry to respond to the criticism, largely Republican sponsored, that has been heaped on his Vietnam service since the Democratic nominee showcased his military service during his national convention last month.</p>",
  "For the first time since the Vietnam era, foreign policy and security have emerged as the key issues in a US presidential election, according to the latest polls. <p>Earlier surveys had suggested that this November's US election would be fought over the economies of the Midwest swing states, but a Gallup poll for the <a href=\"http://people-press.org/reports/display.php3?ReportID=222\" target=\"_NEW\">Pew Research centre</a> put national security at the core of the battle.</p> <p>\"For the first time since the Vietnam era, national security issues are looming larger than economic issues in an election year,\" said Andrew Kohut, Pew's director.</p> <p>Four people in 10 named war, terrorism and foreign policy as the most important issues facing the nation, while one-quarter of those polled said economic issues were the most important. In January, national security issues were rated as equally important to economic issues.</p> <p>The last election year when national security issues were rated the most important was 1972, according to Pew's analysis of data going back half a century. But it is unclear whether the security focus is of more benefit to George Bush or John Kerry.</p> <p>Six in 10 people in the US say the use of military force can sometimes be justified against countries that may seriously threaten the country but have not attacked, while two-thirds worry about a loss of respect internationally for the US.</p> <p>The US president is seen as stronger on handling terrorism than Mr Kerry, but six in 10 say the Bush administration is too quick to use force instead of trying for diplomatic solutions.</p> <p>\"If it were decided purely on terrorism, Bush would most likely win; if it were decided purely on the economy, Kerry would most likely win,\" Mr Kohut said.</p> <p>\"In a sense, Iraq has become the trump card,\" he added. \"Even though Bush's approval rating on Iraq is pretty miserable, Kerry has yet to make that issue work for him.\"</p> <p>Mr Kerry has struggled with stating his position on Iraq, defending his vote authorising the war while criticising the Bush administration's conduct of the war and its difficulties in postwar Iraq.</p> <p>Democrats say Kerry has a \"nuanced position\" and Republicans call it a series of \"flip-flops\".</p> <p>National polls have shown the overall race remains close, with Kerry slightly ahead in some.</p> <p>The Pew study was based primarily on a poll of 2,009 adults interviewed between July 8 and July 18, with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2.5%, and a second poll taken in August. The second poll of 1,512 adults, from August 5 to August 10, has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3%.</p>",
  "In the last year of his life, when most people tend to succumb to comforting illusions, John Weightman, who has died of cancer aged 88, wrote his lucid and devastating analysis, Reading The Bible In The Run-up To Death, dismissing the text's main character as \"that unpleasant person, God\". It was absolutely characteristic of this fearless humanist thinker, who referred to himself as an absurdist. It was also characteristic in that it was inspired not by an English text, but by a recently published new French translation: as well as being an outstanding writer and critic, Weightman was a French scholar of distinction, and had a lifelong involvement in both cultures. <p>Reading The Bible (Weech Publishing, 2003) shows the same precise analysis of the text and the same wry humour as that which propelled him to fame as a star book reviewer for the Observer in the 1950s and 60s and made him an internationally admired essayist to the end of his days. He wrote extensively for Encounter in its heyday, the Sunday Telegraph, the New Statesman, the Times Literary Supplement, the London Review of Books, the Spectator, Twentieth Century, the Hudson Review and other journals. In recent years, he wrote almost exclusively for the New York Review of Books. </p> <p>Weightman was a descriptive critic: he condemned or praised books out of their own mouths; his comments were always based on the text he was reviewing, so the reader had the opportunity to agree or disagree with him. Thus in the case of the Bible, he showed the absurdity, the divine murderous unscrupulousness, the moral insanity that is its hallmark, simply by reporting on it. </p> <p>The son of a Northumbrian miner, Weightman fell in love with the French language at the age of 11, thanks to an inspiring teacher at Hexham grammar school. Turning down the chance of a place at Oxford or Cambridge, he went on to the King's College, Newcastle (then part of Durham University), where he got a first in French in 1936 and met his wife Doreen - thereby solving, as he noted in Memoirs Of A Language Freak (2004), one of the most difficult problems of existence early in life. </p> <p>They were married in 1940 and lived in loving harmony for 45 years, collaborating on translations of many French books, including the major works of Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss. After her death he referred to himself as posthumous. </p> <p>From 1936 to 1939, Weightman perfected his French at Poitiers University. During the second world war, he worked in the French section of the BBC World Service, chairing discussions between French and British thinkers, including Bertrand Russell. Weightman was the only Briton to broadcast on the news programme The French Speak To The French, which broadcast hope and coded messages to occupied France: on many occasions he read the news while General Charles de Gaulle sat opposite him, waiting to address his people, but they never exchanged words. </p> <p>After the war, Weightman spent long periods in Paris for the BBC, until in 1950 he began to teach at the University of London, rising to professor of French (1963-78) and head of department at Westfield College, while continuing to write and broadcast in Britain and abroad. Much as he was honoured by French scholars and intellectuals (the French government made him Commandeur dans L'Ordre des Palmes Acad\u00e9miques), he brought peculiarly British pragmatism to his trenchant criticism of French intellectual fashions and their prophets such as Jacques Derrida and Michel Foucault. </p> <p>In a 1998 essay in the US magazine Twentieth Century - and particularly influential there - he championed the much abused and much needed Intellectual Impostures by Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont, which was a follow-up to a parody written by Sokal that had been published unwittingly by the journal Social Text and had exposed the lack of understanding some French academic theorists had of the mathematics and science they were bringing to the study of literature. </p> <p>All his life, Weightman had a fruitful passion for language and the meaning of words. The Cat Sat On The Mat (Language And The Absurd, 2002) and his two other books are about the mystery of language. Reversing Ren\u00e9 Descartes' dictum, he argued \"I am, therefore I think.\" </p> <p>He was motivated throughout by, as he put it, receptive curiosity. When age made it difficult for him to move about, he learned Russian to amuse himself, and with the language he picked up an extensive knowledge of Russian affairs. In the 20 years I knew him, I never met him without learning something important. Even once his own condition had become hopeless, he discussed with animated curiosity the latest turns of the language. It dismayed him that some young people did not possess - and far less saw the point of - dictionaries: he considered the enlarging of our vocabularies as the only way to extend the boundaries and depth of our thinking. </p> <p>It is to be hoped that news of his death will prompt more people to read his books. </p> <p>He is survived by his son Gavin and his daughter Jane. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> John George Weightman, academic and writer, born November 29 1915; died August 14 2004</p>"
