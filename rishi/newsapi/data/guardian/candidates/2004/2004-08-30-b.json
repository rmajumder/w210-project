  "The crowd at the campaign rally in Annandale, Virginia, knew exactly what it wanted. As President George Bush mounted the podium, the cry went up: \"Four more years! Four more years!\" <p>It is a cry that will be heard again and again this week at the Republican party's national convention in New York City. But while four more years of Mr Bush seems a terrific idea to the party faithful, the prospect arouses mixed feelings beyond America's shores. </p> <p>For Britain, in particular, Mr Bush's term in office has proved divisive and occasionally humiliating, especially in respect of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, but also over issues ranging from climate change and the international criminal court to protectionist American steel tariffs. </p> <p>There can be no doubt that Britain has been a good friend to the US in recent years. Whether the Bush administration has been a good friend to Britain is a different matter altogether. </p> <p>So would four more years of Mr Bush follow the same pattern? The authors Ivo Daalder and James Lindsay, in their new book on the neo-conservative hegemonistic tendency, America Unbound, believe that the president has wrought a permanent foreign policy revolution. </p> <p>They cite, in particular, his doctrine of pre-emptive war and regime change, his disdain for the \"international community\", and his unabashed unilateralism. It is what Robert Hunter, a former US ambassador to Nato, diplomatically calls a \"major experiment in foreign policy\". </p> <p>But another body of US opinion, typified by Joseph Nye of Harvard, holds that recent experience - not least the chastening lessons of Iraq - are already pushing Mr Bush back toward a more traditional, consensus-based approach. </p> <p>Professor Nye suggests that a second term would see greater US emphasis on allies and institutions and a search for negotiated, rather than military, solutions in places like North Korea. </p> <p>Significantly, perhaps, a senior Republican senator, Chuck Hagel, recently called on the administration to \"help strengthen global institutions... Winning the war on terrorism will require a seamless network of relationships\", he said. </p> <p>The UN, Mr Hagel said, \"is more relevant today than it has ever been... [it] has an essential role to play in post-conflict transitions\". </p> <p>Britain's former foreign secretary Robin Cook also believes Mr Bush's actions since 2001 have demonstrated the limitations rather than the attractions of unilateralism. Rather than test this theory further, Mr Cook and others like him would plainly prefer to deal in future with a President John Kerry. </p> <p>But whether or not Mr Bush has learned his lessons, Britain and Mr Blair must anticipate more sharp-edged problems with US policy if a second Bush term comes to pass. </p> <p>One simmering area of disagreement concerns the Palestine-Israel conflict. Mr Blair has repeatedly personally championed the \"road map\" peace process; reports from Washington suggest that Mr Bush has effectively abandoned it. This is a row just waiting to happen. </p> <p>Iran remains a big worry. While the potential for a transatlantic rift can be exaggerated, given London's disappointment at Tehran's perceived recent backward steps, US sabre-rattling echoes jarringly down Whitehall's corridors.</p> <p>Syria and Cuba reveal clearer differences in approach. Mr Bush's controversial Latin America special envoy, Otto Reich, has been quietly cooking up a \"transition strategy\" for a post-Castro Cuba, ignoring the fact that President Castro is still very much around.</p> <p>Threatening behaviour towards Damascus and Havana may be an unsavoury feature of a second Bush term. Meanwhile, further American \"war on terror\" excesses and its abuses of human rights and judicial processes could prove politically explosive in London. </p> <p>Mr Bush's refusal to support multilateral arms control and counter-proliferation treaties, particularly dismaying to Britain, would be another ongoing source of friction. There is a high embarrassment factor, too, in his insistence on pursuing \"son of Star Wars\" missile defences, including upgraded British facilities. </p> <p>Given the enduring importance to the US of cheap foreign oil, as highlighted by the presidential campaign, Mr Blair's efforts to resuscitate the Kyoto pact may continue to struggle. Nor is another British priority - meeting the UN's millennium development goals and raising overall foreign aid - likely to receive much bottom-line encouragement.</p> <p>It may be that a second-term Bush will be a changed man. Failing that admittedly optimistic scenario, it may be that Mr Blair will be able to paper over any difficulties and disappointments, as hitherto, and so maintain his White House best-buddy routine.</p> <p>That assumes, of course, that Mr Blair will also be granted the favour of four more years.</p>",
  "The Kremlin's choice for president of Chechya, Alu Alkhanov, has won the troubled region's presidential election, officials said today. <p>Mr Alkhanov replaces the former Chechen president, Kremlin-backed Akhmad Kadyrov, who was assassinated in a bomb attack in May. </p> <p>He received nearly 74% of the vote in yesterday's ballot, said the Chechen elections commission head, Abdul-Kerim Arsakhanov. </p> <p>Other candidates complained of widespread electoral violations in a vote that was shadowed by violence, including a man who blew himself up near a polling station in the Chechen capital, Grozny. </p> <p>Mr Arsakhanov, however, said there were no violations and that turnout was about 85%, even though many polling stations appeared sparsely attended. </p> <p>Candidate Abdullah Bugayev said he had formally complained to election officials after seeing several violations, including an Alkhanov campaign worker who ordered people to vote for him at a polling station. </p> <p>A representative of Movsur Khamidov, another candidate, said he found ballot boxes at a polling station stuffed full shortly after it opened. </p> <p>Chechen rebels have been fighting Russian forces for nearly five years, and the region's more than one million residents have been deeply scarred by the conflict. Nearly three-quarters of the population are without work, and electricity and telephone service are largely non-existent. </p> <p>Tens of thousands of people have fled, mostly to neighbouring regions. Hundreds have disappeared in kidnappings blamed on separatist fighters, Russian forces and allied paramilitaries.</p> <p>A British foreign office minister, Bill Rammell, said that although the UK welcomed the attempt at a political solution to the fighting in Chechnya, the government had \"serious concerns about the way these elections have been conducted\".</p> <p>\"In our view, another opportunity has been missed to build up the political process,\" Mr Rammell said in a statement. \"Nevertheless, we hope that Mr Alkhanov and the Russian authorities will now try to advance reconciliation in Chechnya, press forward with parliamentary elections and take real steps to address serious problems of human rights abuses, especially abductions and disappearances.\" </p> <p>An election last October based on that strategy brought Akhmad Kadyrov to power, but ended in his assassination. Fighting, violent crime and abductions have continued unabated. </p> <p>Police and soldiers were out in force for the election, riding in cars or manning checkpoints. Pedestrians were scarce on Grozny's streets, many of which are lined with war-shattered apartment buildings with collapsed floors and large holes in their facades. </p> <p>Russian forces have been unable to wipe out Chechen rebels in two wars over the past decade and the Kremlin, refusing to negotiate, has focused on trying to restore civil society in the republic. However, recent weeks indicate that the separatists remain determined in their fight. On August 21, some 30 people were reported killed in a night of attacks on police stations and patrols in Grozny. </p> <p>In addition, suspicions have mounted that Chechen fighters or their supporters brought down two Russian airliners that crashed nearly simultaneously last Tuesday. Officials say traces of explosives were found in the wreckage of both planes and that they are investigating two Chechen women who were among the passengers, one aboard each plane. </p> <p> </p>",

  "One of the surest ways of testing a country's political temperature is to look at the national bestseller list. The current No 1 on Amazon's chart, Unfit for Command, in which \"Swift Boat veterans speak out against John Kerry\", will draw attention in this country. Formerly No 1, currently holding on at No 3 among the mega-sellers, The American Prophecies, will probably not. It should. <p>The author, Michael D Evans, is part preacher, would-be sooth-sayer, big-time blowhard. He's also rich, given his book's runaway sales. Not that money is a main motive, any more than it was for Moses. The book purports to reveal how \"ancient prophecies reveal our nation's future\". More precisely these prophecies, correctly decoded, confirm that George Bush's tearing up of the Middle East road map, last April, has found great favour with God. </p> <p>The current conflict accords exactly, for those that have eyes to see, or teachers like the Rev Evans to instruct them, with the divinely ordained script for America and Israel. We are now, as Evans puts it, \"in the eye of the prophetic storm\". Bracing, perilous, but for the American faithful, deeply reassuring. </p> <p>Much of The American Prophecies is devoted to close exegesis of the page of the Bible on which incoming presidents have laid their hand while taking the oath of office during the swearing-in ceremony. It is a presidential privilege to choose the passage. What did the 42nd president (known to the irreverent as Slick Willy) select for that fateful day? Galatians 6:8, \"For he that soweth unto his own flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption.\" </p> <p>Prophetic or what? More damning, however, than his fleshly reapings with Monica, was Clinton's betraying the sacred mission entrusted him by God. He cannot plead ignorance, when his time comes to stand before the divine bench. As governor of Arkansas, he was specifically instructed by his pastor, the Rev WO Vaught, \"You might be president one day. You will make mistakes and God will forgive you. But God will never forgive you if you turn your back on Israel.\" Which, to the great peril of his country, Clinton did, at Camp David in July 2000. What followed, 14 months later in Manhattan, was a mark of God's stern displeasure at the errant president. </p> <p>Evans' exegesis demonstrates to his satisfaction, and that of millions of his countrymen apparently, that America, no less than Israel, is centrally alluded to in Bible prophecy. Under un-Godly presidents (notably Carter, Clinton and Bush I) the US has dallied with its false marriage partner Ishmael/Islam, foregoing religious principle for oil. Now, under Bush II, it is cleaving to its true partner, Isaac/Israel. </p> <p>It is clear to Evans' prophetic mind \"that America must go to war against Syria, a much more dangerous terrorist-harbouring state than Iraq\" and that \"Israel must go into Iran and take out their nuclear reactor\". God wants these acts of war. Not to comply would induce Him to lift His \"hedge of protection\" and permit a \"much, much worse\" consequence than 9/11. For Evans, \"God is foreign policy\". And there is only one item on the agenda: stand by Israel, crush her foes. </p> <p>The American Prophecies would not matter were it not that (1) so many Americans are reading it and (2) Bush is wooing the Christian right as core voters for his re-election. How far will he go to keep them on board if he gets his second term? Will he have the good sense to use them and dump them? </p> <p>Thoughtful Israelis must also have mixed feelings about Evans and his co-religionists. The latter's support for the state of Israel is unswerving - but with the awkward proviso of a mass conversion to Christianity by the Jews after the \"final battle in prophecy\". </p> <p>With friends like Michael D Evans, they may think, who needs Yasser Arafat?</p>",
  "<p>In a startling polemic against the evils of television excess, John Humphrys used his MacTaggart lecture to tear strips off the broadcasting industry for the \"mind-numbing, witless vulgarity\" of \"so-called reality television\". While the best of television was better than ever, the worst was so much worse. </p> <p>Even though the attack itself had been expected, its ferocity and passion was a surprise. But perhaps even more surprising was the unwillingness of the assembled luminaries of the broadcasting industry to engage with the debate he started. Channel 4, whose Big Brother series came in for a particular savaging in Humphrys' speech, made strenuous efforts to avoid saying anything at all in response, and its chief executive. Andy Duncan, gave only the blandest of replies when challenged on one of the Edinburgh debate panels. Kevin Lygo, director of programmes at Channel 4 and Tim Hincks, creative director of Big Brother producers Endemol, decided to go for a curry instead of subjecting themselves to Humphrys' attack in person. </p> <p>Humphrys indeed had some strong words. Much of what television produces, he said has a coarsening effect and \"turns human beings into freaks for us to gawp at\". He added: \"The good television of today is probably better than the best television of the old days. The bad television of today is worse. It is not only bad - it is damaging, meretricious, seedy and cynical.\" </p> <p>Around Edinburgh later, many delegates took the easy route of dismissing Humphrys as a \"grumpy old man\" whose views were invalidated by his claim not to have owned a television set for the past five years. </p> <p>Certainly, it was easy to pick holes in the Today presenter's argument. How could he rail against the curse of the format when he identified one of his favourite programmes as Operatunity, an opera talent show that would not have existed without Pop Idol or Popstars before it? Surely it could not be, as he seemed to suggest, that practically everything that could be defined as reality television was bad? </p> <p>In fact, Humphrys' speech was more thoughtful and layered than the later characterisations of it suggested. There may have been flaws in the argument - but when was that ever a disqualification for a MacTaggart lecturer? - but its subject was the heart and soul of television, delivered from the heart and soul of someone who has worked in broadcasting for decades. MediaGuardian decided to round up some reaction from the key players - some of it from panel sessions, others from one-to-one interviews. </p> <p><strong> Andy Duncan, Chief executive, Channel 4</strong><br> I'm a Big Brother fan. I watched it right the way from the first series. It was an interesting lecture, and you have to look at it in the wider context - there are a lot of people who don't like reality TV and there are others who find it entertaining. When it first started, it clearly pushed the boundaries, providing a new type of programme. It is more entertainment now. Channel 4 does have to make money. Last year was a bit dull, this year there was a more interesting set of characters, but I'm not sure Big Brother 6 needs to be more extreme. I don't anticipate that it's all about getting more extreme. </p> <p><strong> Mark Thompson, Director general, BBC</strong><br> Commercially funded public service broadcasting inevitably involves compromises. You may decry Big Brother 5 - how terribly dumbing down, how seedy. But in a straightforward profit-and-loss way which you can measure to the nearest pound coin, Big Brother helps pay for Channel 4 News and Operatunity. It's hard to see how you have the second - certainly at current levels of investment - without the first. Again, risk-taking, which is vital to Channel 4, has to take place mainly within the realities of the audiences and brand values which the commercial public service broadcasters' funding models point to. </p> <p><strong> Kevin Lygo, Director of programmes, Channel 4</strong><br> Has Big Brother made television coarser? No, I think that television is getting closer to a more genuine reflection of society. What you find is that some white middle class people who went to university are irritated by Big Brother, they don't like the fact that these people are on the telly at all, and I find that elitist snobbish and patrician at best. The whole Big Brother-gets-evil concept was just a bit of dressing. This series was not different from the last one except in the casting because the show in the end is all about the casting of the people in it. We were more conscious this time that nice normal people don't make for a great piece of entertainment television. You have to find a balance of more extrovert characters who you hope won't go over the top but will make it more interesting. </p> <p><strong> Jana Bennett, Director of television, BBC</strong><br> John lobbed in to the debate on television the big E - not entertainment, but ethics, and it's valid to ask the whole industry why we make programmes and what the purpose of those programmes is. It's important to have these debates - although there is an aspect to the debate which is that reality TV is part of life but not as John knows it. He may find that offensive, although not all shows are as extreme as he makes them out to be, but I share his issues about where TV is going. I don't think creative breakthroughs are made by exploiting or degrading. As someone who is a self-confessed grumpy old man, John is the ideal man to lob the ethical stone into the broadcasting pond and see the debate ripple out. </p> <p><strong> Hamish Mykura, Head of history, Channel 4</strong><br> I think it's very good that somebody has read the riot act to the television industry, but I do feel that some of his targets were easy. He hasn't owned a TV set for five years so maybe his conclusions aren't quite what they might have been otherwise, but it's extremely valid to raise these issues. It's easy not to ask the big ethical questions. </p> <p><strong> Anne Morrison, Controller of documentaries and contemporary factual, BBC</strong><br> He started off talking about lifestyle programmes and then went on to talk about reality programmes - but homes and gardens are a million miles away from reality TV. He lumped popular factual all together, but you can't take a genre and say it's all bad. There are good reality programmes and bad reality programmes, you can't just castigate a whole genre. He tacitly admitted his inconsistency when he said he enjoyed Operatunity. I felt he was objecting to the subject matter rather than the narrative technique. </p> <p><strong> Lord Dubs, Former chairman, broadcasting standards commission</strong><br> The big thing for us was the watershed. We treated pre-watershed programmes very differently from post-watershed ones. At some point adult society has to take responsibility for what they watch. For a regulator, it is easy to deal with individual complaints, but John Humphrys makes a point about the cumulative effect and that is harder to deal with. It's hard in an adult society to have a regulatory regime that would give effect to everything that John was talking about. </p> <p><strong> Glenwyn Benson, Controller of factual programmes, BBC</strong><br> He raised some interesting questions, but I would quibble with some of the examples that he raised. With Little Angels, we know from the feedback that a lot of parents with young children who watched it get fantastic tips. Families weren't exploited because we kept the expert at arms 'length, He's right to say 'is it real'? Is reality the right word? But let's not forget that there are many programmes where you are following somebody's personal journey, and from the audience point of view that is fantastic value, watching people learn for themselves. But you have to be very careful that you don't look at the whole genre and say it's all bad. You do have to ask the question, what is the value to the audience? He said 'do no harm' but did he show evidence that TV does harm? It's a valid question to ask. </p> <p><strong> Yvonne Taylor, Publicist, Channel 4</strong><br> I was disappointed to hear what John Humphrys said. [To Humphrys] Isn't it just the case that you understand what you like and you like what you understand. Isn't it the case that you don't like Big Brother because you don't understand young people in Britain today? </p> <p><strong> Simon Cowell, Pop impresario</strong></p> <p> Big Brother last year was like watching paint dry. The characters were too nice, there was nothing interesting to talk about. This year they got it right, it was fascinating TV, with the stalker [Michelle], it was every guy's nightmare, it was compelling. I'm not ashamed to say it. I have to congratulate them as programme-makers for making great TV. Not everyone liked it, and it was like a dirty little secret to admit to liking it, but there are 150 channels and if you want to watch the History Channel then you can. I wish I'd made it. </p> <p><strong> Jim Hytner, Director of marketing, ITV</strong><br> The problem for Channel 4 with Big Brother is that it defines their brand. All of the executives at Channel 4 end up comically trying to intellectualise about a lowest common denominator programme - that I love - but it is not what Channel 4 should be about. </p> <p><strong> Michael Hurll, TV producer</strong><br> I've dumbed down more TV over the past 40 years than anyone else here, and I'm proud of it.</p>",

  "The Kremlin's choice for Chechen president was poised last night to win elections in the shattered republic in a vote condemned by many observers as farcical. <p>Alu Alkhanov, Chechnya's interior minister, won the 50% required, according to early results, which showed around 80% of voters cast a ballot. He will replace Akhmad Kadyrov, who was assassinated in a bomb blast in May,seemingly by militant separatists. </p> <p>Although overshadowed by last week's bombing of two Russian aircraft blamed on Chechens, the vote passed off relatively peacefully, aside from an explosion near a polling station that killed only the attacker. </p> <p>Mr Alkhanov was clear favourite to win the vote. Vote manipulation is rife, and Mr Alkhanov's main competitor, Malik Saidullayev, was barred from running in the race, leaving only a handful of unknowns or Kadyrov loyalists to present a nominal challenge to Mr Alkhanov. </p> <p>Final voting figures will be made known in a few days. </p> <p>More than 17,000 troops patrolled the streets yesterday. The most active voting was seen in Tsentoroi, the home town of the late president, where half the registered electorate had purportedly voted by 11am, Interfax reported. </p> <p>The man who blew himself up at a polling station in Grozny was identified as local resident Rustam Chebiyev, 25. He was asked to open a package by security staff and tried to run away, but detonated the device on realising he could not escape. No one else was hurt. Several polling stations were attacked last weekend by militant separatists who have sought to frighten Chechens away from voting. Separatist leader Aslan Maskhadov has vowed to kill the winner. </p> <p>The Kremlin hopes Mr Alkhanov can continue its policy of allowing Chechnya to govern itself and for pro-Moscow Chechens to suppress separatists.</p>",
  "Everything that could possibly have been tried in Chechnya has been. It has been invaded and the capital Grozny retaken, twice. It has been allowed to exist as a de facto independent state. It has been ruled directly from Moscow. Three of the last four Chechens to hold the title of president have been assassinated - two by the Russians, and one by Chechen rebels - and the fourth is in hiding. The rebel movement has been split and turned against itself. Russian forces have used collective punishment, summary execution, torture, rape, kidnap, extortion and terror to pacify a brutalised population, and nothing works. Chechnya has been conscripted into George Bush's war on terror, and the west has been silent. But however many times the war has been declared over by Moscow, it plainly isn't. <p>Yesterday another election was staged and a fifth president, Alu Alkhanov, installed. His main rival was struck off the election ballot on a technicality. Mr Alkhanov will only provide temporary relief to Russian president Vladimir Putin. The clan Moscow has backed, armed Chechens loyal to Ramzan Kadyrov, the 27-year-old son of the last president, are corrupt thugs incapable of providing war-weary Chechens with the law and order they crave. They are, on the other hand, quite capable of letting through their roadblocks the next squad of rebel attackers to seize Grozny or neighbouring Nazran in Ingushetia - if the price is right. </p> <p>Without sacrificing its claims to sovereignty over a small mountain land, Russia is surely capable of devising a strategy which does not involve another decade of murder and terror. It would involve identifying authoritative Chechen leaders with whom to negotiate a ceasefire, and being prepared to invite in international organisations like the OSCE to help provide security. Chechnya did not start as a land filled with Russian-hating Muslim jihadists. It attached itself to al-Qaida's wagon, not simply because the Wahhabis had more money than the more moderate arm of Chechen separatism, but also because of the brutal tactics Russia employed.</p>",
  "The Taliban claimed responsibility for a car bomb that ripped through Kabul yesterday. The Afghan government said two Americans, three Nepalese and two Afghans were killed in what was the largest attack for months in the Afghan capital. <p>A further 10 people, nine of them children, were killed in a separate bombing in southern Afghanistan at the weekend, marking a serious escalation in violence in the run up to October's presidential election. </p> <p>The Kabul bomb exploded in the late afternoon in front an office occupied by Dyncorp, a private firm that protects interim Afghan president Hamid Karzai, and which also works for the US government in Iraq. </p> <p>The explosion, which a Taliban official said had been triggered by a remote-controlled device, shook rush-hour Kabul at about 5.40pm, shattering windows half a mile away. Smoke billowed from the building as emergency services rushed to the scene. Plain-clothes US soldiers car rying submachine guns cordoned off the area with the help of Afghan police. </p> <p>At the blast site several vehicles stood destroyed in front of a gutted building. One badly charred vehicle was overturned close to a metre-deep crater in the centre of the road, which appeared to mark the detonation point. A witness, Abdul Jalil, wearing a bloodstained tunic and with a bandage on his face, stumbled from the scene with the help of Afghan police officers. </p> <p>He had been working in the building next door when the bomb went off, he said. </p> <p>\"I was sitting on a chair waiting for office hours to finish. There was an explosion, and a big fire in front of the American and British house. Then I saw some seriously injured foreigners running from their office.\" </p> <p>The interior minister, Ali Ahmad Jalali, visited the scene of the explosion an hour later. At that time he said he knew that least four people had been killed and two injured. </p> <p>\"Terrorists are behind this action,\" he said, but refused to speculate on which group was responsible, saying only: \"Terrorists are terrorists. That's their identity.\" </p> <p>Mr Jalali said the Nato-led International Security Assistance Force (Isaf) and the Afghan police had started investigations into the explosion. A Taliban spokesman told Reuters that the device had been detonated by remote control. </p> <p>Reporters saw the badly mutilated body of a man lying in the street before Afghan police and foreign security guards pushed them back at gunpoint. Residents said a boy living in a neighbouring house and a cobbler whose stall was blown away by the blast were also killed, and up to eight others wounded. </p> <p>The second attack happened in Naiknam, a village in Paktia province, 80 miles south of Kabul, on Saturday night when a blast ripped through a religious school. The provincial governor, Haji Assadullah Wafa, said the explosion was caused by a mine laid by the Taliban, who are fighting US troops in the area. </p> <p>\"They don't want Afghan children to study and participate in the future reconstruction of their country,\" Mr Wafa told the Guardian. The school had received funding from the International Rescue Committee, an American aid agency, he added. </p> <p>The Taliban have vowed to disrupt Afghanistan's forthcoming presidential election on October 9, which the interim president Mr Karzai is favoured to win. </p> <p>Mr Wafa said the Taliban were still using Pakistan as a rear base, despite promises from the Pakistani president, Pervez Musharraf, that he would stop them. \"Taliban fugitives receive logistical support in Pakistan and then cross the border to plot against the security and stability of Afghanistan,\" he said. </p> <p>As night fell in Kabul the police carried a body wrapped in black plastic on a stretcher from the scene of the blast. US special forces used sniffer dogs and torches to search the surrounding area for possible secondary explosives. </p> <p>\"This was a big one,\" said one gun-wielding plain-clothes soldier standing near by.</p>",
  "Four years ago, when George Bush received the presidential nomination in the City of Brotherly Love, America's Republicans presented themselves as a party of inclusion, unity and reconciliation. It was a formidable piece of political deception. The party that Mr Bush inherited was increasingly one of economic deregulation, social conservatism and global unilateralism with little feeling for those who did not share its values - a far cry from the party of Dwight Eisenhower or Theodore Roosevelt. Nevertheless, in Philadelphia in 2000 the Republicans depicted themselves as moderate and multicultural, and the convention ended with a speech from Mr Bush in which he offered himself as a compassionate conservative and as a healer of divisions. The entire event, as a veteran US commentator remarked, may have been a joke. But it was a joke that came off. Mr Bush left Philadelphia 14 points ahead of Al Gore in the polls, and the rest is history. <p>Four years on, this time in the City That Never Sleeps, the Republicans will try to repeat the trick. The party's moderates - senator John McCain, California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and former New York mayor Rudolph Giuliani - have been granted primetime speaking slots to imply to the watching public that they are figures of greater heft in Mr Bush's counsels than they really are. Black and Latino delegates will be highlighted in an attempt to pretend the party is less white than it really is. And Mr Bush will use his acceptance speech on Thursday to reprise the compassionate and moderate themes that served him well in the last campaign and which need to work again if he is to see off the challenge of senator John Kerry. </p> <p>The Republican party of 2000 happily acquiesced in the last deception, and it will eagerly do the same in this one. The purpose of a US convention these days is solely presentational. These Republican delegates have come to New York to play their loyal part in the process. But the delegates are not like other Americans. Only 3% of them oppose the Iraq war, a New York Times survey reported yesterday, compared with 51% of Americans as a whole. Only 7% of them think the US should work through the UN to solve international problems, compared with 49% of all Americans. Only 15% of the delegates think the government should do more to protect the environment, compared with 59% of the US as a whole. </p> <p>It is a mistake to dismiss the party and its voters from top to bottom as ideological conservatives. One in three of the delegates in New York this week consider themselves moderates rather than conservatives, which is similar to the proportion among Republican voters too. The Republican party is in some ways less riven along ideological lines than it was a decade ago, as the commentator David Brooks thoughtfully pointed out last week. There is a lot of agreement with Mr Bush's core instincts, but there is also a lot of anxiety in the party about getting Iraq right, about the federal deficit and about wasteful spending. This is, after all, the party that controls both the White House and the Congress, and ideological disputes have been replaced by problems of governance. </p> <p>And that, after all, is the big difference between 2000 and 2004. Four years ago, Mr Bush was running on a promise. This year he is running on his record. Voters will be given the same message this time around, but this time they have more to judge it against. This is why Mr Bush is having a harder time in the polls against Mr Kerry than he did against Mr Gore. The central fact about US politics today is that Mr Bush is currently losing this election. The convention week has therefore become a crucial opportunity for him to turn the tide in his favour, especially among the unusually few voters who have not yet made up their minds who to vote for in November.</p>",
  "<b>Gary J Andres</b> <br> Washington Times, August 26, 2004 <p>\"[Today], Republicans gather for their national convention in New York ... At the Democratic convention, historically low network news coverage, coupled with a record number of voters saying they 'already made up their minds' and the earliest vice-presidential pick ever, all conspired to attenuate the expected John Kerry bounce ... [President George Bush] might suffer a similar fate after the Republican convention - many, if not all, of the same blip producing circumstances exist. But ... unlike Mr Kerry, Mr Bush will not spend his convention week 'redefining' himself ...

  "Liam Fox, the Conservative party chairman, will fly into New York for the Republican convention today despite a row between Michael Howard and George Bush. <p>The senior Tory, attending the convention with the party's former leader William Hague, and frontbenchers George Osborne and Tim Loughton, will be hoping for a meeting with the US president, though none has been promised or arranged. </p> <p>Any discussion is likely to be seen as a chance to build bridges after the Tory leader was provoked into issuing a blistering riposte to the US president over his decision to bar him from the White House for an attack on Tony Blair. </p> <p>Mr Howard's rebuff - which marks a new low in historically strong relations between the Conservatives and the Republicans - came after it emerged that Karl Rove, Mr Bush's closest adviser, told Mr Howard's aides: \"You can forget about meeting the president. Don't bother coming. You are not meeting him,\" in a phone call in February. </p> <p>That followed Mr Howard's decision to call on Mr Blair to \"seriously consider his position\" after admitting he did not know if the 45-minute claim related to long or short-range weapons of mass destruction. </p> <p>This weekend, after the Sun reported the row, Mr Howard reacted with fury. </p> <p>In a statement, he said: \"A Conservative government would work very closely with President Bush or President Kerry, but my job as leader of the opposition is to say things as I see them in the interests of our country and to hold our government to account. </p> <p>\"If some people in the White House, in their desire to protect Mr Blair, think I am too tough on Mr Blair or too critical of him, they are entitled to their opinion. But I shall continue to do my job as I see fit.\" </p> <p>The White House has maintained strong links with Mr Howard's predecessors, Mr Hague and Iain Duncan Smith, and the fact that the president was so willing to snub Mr Howard will be a blow - suggesting that he sees no likelihood of having to do business with him as prime minister.</p>",
  "Just around the corner from the town green in New Haven, Connecticut, the protesters spotted the first target of the day: Starbucks. As some marched in to distribute leaflets to the macchiato-sipping intelligentsia from Yale University, one explained to the coffee shop customers the ills of the globalisation they were funding while the office manager unsuccessfully tried to hustle them all out. <p>\"It's so important to shake up people's world like that,\" said Kim, one of about 50 mostly young protesters who spent last week marching the 258 miles to the Republican convention in New York from Boston, the site of last month's Democratic convention. </p> <p>\"I'm going because it's important that people around the world know that George Bush doesn't speak for us.\" </p> <p>And so they came in cars and vans from far and wide - from Kalamazoo, Michigan, to President Bush's former residence of Austin, Texas - converging on the streets of New York to protest at the Republican gathering. </p> <p>As the temperature reached 29C (85F) and the polarised political climate threatened to raise tempers to boiling point, as many as 250,000 hit the streets to march past the convention site at Madison Square Garden on the eve of the convention before attending a rally at Union Square. </p> <p>In a week when the Republicans could well find themselves becoming the sideshow, demonstrators had already stolen the headlines. On Thursday, a group of Aids activists stripped off near the convention site to protest against Mr Bush's policies towards Aids and third-world debt. </p> <p>When asked about it at a press conference, New York's mayor, Michael Bloomberg, said: \"This is New York. Of course we had seven naked people on Eighth Avenue before. What's the question?\" </p> <p>Earlier that day, four protesters unfurled a huge banner outside the Plaza Hotel with the words \"Truth\" and \"Bush\" written on arrows painted in opposite directions to great cheers. On Friday, about 5,000 environmental protesters on bicycles held up rush-hour traffic in West Side, Midtown and the East Village. By yesterday morning, more than 300 protesters had already been arrested, mainly for disorderly conduct - about 40 times the number held throughout the Democratic convention. </p> <p>With many marchers vowing yesterday to defy the ban on rallying in Central Park to hold a \"people's picnic\", the prospect of the hastily agreed route ending in chaos remained a distinct possibility. </p> <p>A mixture of hysteria and hype has prepared those New Yorkers who haven't left for the convention week for the worst. The front page of Newsday on Friday featured a large picture of police in riot gear and the words: \"NYPD: We're Ready.\" </p> <p>It wasn't supposed to happen like this. The city government had launched a campaign for people to \"make nice\" while delegates were in town. Indeed, that was the banner headline of yesterday's Daily News. </p> <p>But at a newspaper stand at Union Square, a man from South Carolina in a Bush/Cheney T-shirt - a very rare sight in the city - was making waves. A bystander complained: \"They don't care about me, my family or anyone else in the rest of the world who ain't rich and white. And they don't care about you, neither.\" </p> <p>The Republican replied, sheepishly: \"You can't generalise like that.\" He then sloped off without buying his paper. </p> <p>Back in New Haven on the long march, some protesters pointed towards the elitist Yale Skull and Bones fraternity, to which Mr Bush and his Democratic contender, John Kerry, belonged, as evidence that there was no real difference between them. </p> <p>Most were anarchists, with piercings in places previous generations of radicals would never have dreamt of placing jewellery. But along with Buddhists, pacifists and ageing hippies who talk in rhymes - \"Don't panic, just keep it organic,\" insisted 67-year-old Diamond Dave - they were committed to non-violence, at least on this trip. \"If we want to gain allies among the uncommitted,\" said their leaflet, \"we need to focus public discussion on the issues - not on flag burning, not on graffiti, not on violence.\" </p> <p>They were preaching peace in Iraq while preparing themselves for the possibility of violence in New York city and hoping the size of the protest would overshadow anything else. Dewey, a marcher from Florida, said: \"If enough people come and attract enough attention we can send a message that will encour age a whole lot of other people to get involved.\"</p>",
  "Hundreds of thousands of protesters calling for President George Bush to be removed descended on to the streets of Manhattan yesterday, on the eve of the Republican party convention. <p>But as the demonstrators marched, Republican delegates arrived in town hoping to open a significant lead over the Democratic challenger, John Kerry, for the first time this year. While Mr Bush continued to campaign through the swing states at the weekend ahead of the convention, the race remained a virtual dead heat. A Time magazine poll gave Mr Bush a two percentage point lead, but that was less than the margin of error. </p> <p>The march, of an estimated 250,000 people, passed off peacefully, despite predictions of violence, with demonstrators wearing badges stating \"Re-defeat President Bush\" and banners proclaiming \"Bush lied, thousands died\". Several dozen were arrested, including around 50 on bicycles, but the overall feeling was more carnival than carnage. </p> <p>\"He shouldn't be president and he shouldn't be coming to New York city to take advantage of 9/11,\" said Sarah Johnson, from Newark, New Jersey. \"He's already making the rest of the world hate us and if he gets back in there's no saying what he might do.\" </p> <p>The protest, flanked by police in riot gear, took place amid the tightest security in the history of US politics, with one security officer for every 2.4 delegates at the Republican convention. </p> <p>\"Today we send our message,\" said Leslie Cagan, the leader of United for Peace and Justice, which organised the largest of what promises to be a week of demonstrations. \"We come from all walks of life ... from cities and towns across this nation and together we will march and in a resounding clear voice we will say no to the Bush agenda.\" </p> <p>Before the rally speakers, including the filmmaker Michael Moore, and Jesse Jackson, the civil rights activist, called for an end to the occupation of Iraq and the Bush administration. </p> <p>Kelly Doherty, a former military police sergeant who served in Iraq for a year and helped establish Iraq Veterans Against the War, said: \"This is also dehumanising United States troops who are also having their sense of patriotism and loyalty perverted and used by an administration that would send our women and men to fight, die and kill for lies.\" </p> <p>Mr Bush raised eyebrows in his latest defence of the Iraq war, referring in an interview to the \"catastrophic success\" of the initial invasion, which he said created problems further down the line. </p> <p>\"Had we to do it over again, we would look at the consequences of catastrophic success, being so successful so fast that an enemy that should have surrendered or been done in escaped and lived to fight another day,\" he said. </p> <p>The convention will see the administration veer towards the centre in an attempt to win undecided voters and secure the loyalty of moderate Republicans. The main primetime speakers, apart from the president, will be moderates, and the keynote address will be delivered on Wednesday by a rightwing Democrat, Zell Miller, a senator from Georgia. </p> <p>Campaigning in Ohio and West Virginia at the weekend, Mr Bush emphasised themes aimed at swing voters, such as education and health services. </p> <p>He also took another step in distancing himself from the most heated issue of the summer, the assault on Senator Kerry's Vietnam war record by a group calling itself Swift Boat Veterans for Truth. In an interview on NBC television, he drew a distinction with his own, relatively safe, service in the Texas Air National Guard. </p> <p>\"I think him going to Vietnam was more heroic than my flying fighter jets. He was in harm's way and I wasn't,\" Mr Bush said. </p> <p>However, his wife, Laura, told Time magazine that advertisements questioning Mr Kerry's honesty about his record were not unfair. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Liam Fox, the Conservative party chairman, will fly into New York for the Republican convention today despite a row between Michael Howard and George Bush.</p>",
  "The Republican party will begin an ambitious exercise in political agility today, putting a centrist face on its New York convention while adopting a manifesto even more rightwing than George Bush's administration. <p>It pulled off a similar trick four years ago in Philadelphia, where it illustrated George Bush's \"compassionate conservative\" message by a convention stage crowded with minorities. </p> <p>But after four years of governing from the right it is going to be harder for it to campaign from the centre. </p> <p>The image is going to be tougher to sell, but that has not stopped the Bush campaign trying. </p> <p>Almost all the prime time speakers in Madison Square Garden, with the president and vice-president as two of the rare exceptions, will be moderates whose views on fundamental social issues are at odds with the overwhelming majority of delegates and with the party platform being put together behind the scenes. </p> <p>Tonight the convention will be opened by Rudolf Giuliani, the former mayor of New York, who supports abortion and gay rights, and the president's longstanding Republican rival John McCain, who has been highly critical of the federal deficit and the conduct of the Iraq war, and fiercely opposes a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage. </p> <p>Tomorrow it will be the turn of the party's most cherished celebrity, the governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger, another pro-choice moderate. President Bush himself will be introduced on Thursday by a centrist, George Pataki, the New York governor. </p> <p>The man who has been designated the keynote speaker for the entire convention is not even a Republican. </p> <p>Zell Miller, an outgoing Democratic Senator from Georgia, has been picked to resuscitate another claim of the 2000 campaign, that Mr Bush is a \"uniter not a divider\". </p> <p>This week's polls suggest that while the majority of Americans give the president credit for strong wartime leadership, and a slight edge over John Kerry, the overwhelming majority no longer believe the \"uniter\" label. </p> <p>In a polarised country most Republicans are happy that Mr Bush is a partisan leader, and party strategists are confident that core supporters are so galvanised this year that they will not be alienated by some centrist window dressing. </p> <p>The conservative white evangelical Christians who form the party base can also take comfort from the draft party platform, which is distinctly rightwing. </p> <p>It calls for the appointment of judges who will overturn abortion rights and impose more restrictions on medical research with stem cells (which conservatives claim violates the sanctity of human life). </p> <p>It recommends a constitutional ban on gay marriage, because \"anything less than a constitutional amendment, passed by Congress and ratified by the states, is vulnerable to being overturned by activist judges\". </p> <p>The television pictures of centrist party figures in Madison Square Garden will be aimed not at the loyal party base but at the small proportion of the electorate that is still undecided - most estimates put it at less than 5% - and the minority of moderate Republicans considered vulnerable to John Kerry's masculine war-veteran appeal. </p> <p>The Democrats, who are assembling in force in New York to rebut the Republican message, have been quick to seize on the gap between the convention line-up and the manifesto. </p> <p>\"They are trying to keep the focus on people who frankly have no influence in Washington,\" Senator Hillary Clinton told NBC News yesterday. </p> <p>\"The people who are really running the country under this president will not be highlighted in this convention.\" </p> <p>The same point was made more forcefully by the gay internal pressure group the Log Cabin Republicans, who were outraged by the uncompromising tone of the manifesto. </p> <p>\"You can't craft a vicious, mean-spirited platform and then try to put lipstick on the pig by putting Rudy Giuliani and Arnold Schwarzenegger on in prime time,\" Christopher Barron, a spokesman for the group, said. </p> <p>The Log Cabin faction will decide whether to endorse Mr Bush after the convention. </p> <p>Mr Giuliani protested that he would not be serving as mere lipstick when he addressed the party. </p> <p>Tonight's appearances by Mr Giuliani and Mr McCain serve another important political appearance: to bolster a claim at the heart of the Bush re-election effort - that he is the best candidate to keep America safe. </p> <p>In excerpts from their speeches made available last night, both men were preparing to hail Mr Bush for his res olution in the war on terror. </p> <p>Mr McCain was to say that Mr Bush \"has been tested and has risen to the most important challenge of our time.\" </p> <p>Mr Giuliani's text said Mr Bush \"sees world terrorism for the evil that it is and he will remain consistent to the purpose of defeating it\". </p> <p>The mere presence of Mr Giuliani, a Churchillian figure in New York since the September 11 attacks, reinforces the association that the Bush campaign is attempting to forge in the minds of the voters between the president and the battle against the threat from al-Qaida. </p> <p>That is, after all, the reason the convention is being held in New York, just over a week before the third anniversary of the attacks, and within walking distance of Ground Zero, the site of the World Trade Centre. </p> <p>That was also the site of a pivotal moment in Mr Bush's presidency, when he climbed on top of a pile of the smoking rubble, grabbed a megaphone and voiced American defiance. </p> <p>As is the case with many aspects of this administration, the shape of this week's convention represents an inversion of the choices made by the president's father. </p> <p>At the 1992 Republican convention the senior Mr Bush was running on a moderate record and party platform, but that message was distorted by the appearance on stage of Pat Buchanan, then the leading figure on the Republican right, who declared cultural war on Bill Clinton's Democrats, and unsettled swing voters. </p> <p>Unlike his father, this President Bush has convinced Christian conservatives that he is on their side. </p> <p>To win this election, however, he will have to keep that party base motivated enough to turn up in high numbers, while reviving his appeal to the dwindling pool of voters at the centre. That is the role of this convention.</p>"
