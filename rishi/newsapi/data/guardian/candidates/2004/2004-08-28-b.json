  "Kelly Holmes stormed to victory in the 1,500 metres at the Athens Olympics last night, taking a historic second gold medal and securing her place in the pantheon of British sporting greats. <p>As bookmakers suspended betting on Holmes winning the BBC's sports personality of the year, she became the first British runner to win double gold, having picked up her first medal in the 800 metres earlier last week. Draped in a Union flag after the race, an elated Holmes, 34, said: 'I just can't believe it. I am in absolute, total... I am just gobsmacked.' </p> <p>Britain scored another gold later when the 4x100 metres Olympic men's relay team stormed to a photo finish that saw them pipping their US rivals by one-hundreth of a second. This brings the country's tally to nine medals - the best in years.</p> <p>The golden night for the UK came despite the tired Holmes having 'to use all my guts and strength and just hold on for dear life' in her race to stave off the challenge from the other competitors. </p> <p>She exclaimed: 'Oh my God, that is amazing' when she saw a replay of the final lap, which saw her power to the front of the field and achieve a British record. </p> <p>Holmes, who said before the race that she wanted another gold because she had worn out her other medal from stroking it, eased through the field in a controlled performance before kicking for the line with 200 metres to go. She is the first Briton to win both Olympic middle distance events since Albert Hill in Antwerp 84 years ago in 1920. </p> <p>She guaranteed her place among sport's immortals by winning in three minutes 57.90 seconds, a new personal best and a national record, ahead of Tatyana Tomashova of Russia and Romania's Maria Cioncan. Near the back of the 12-strong field at the bell, Holmes passed several rivals before, with 150 metres to go, powering past the leaders down the last bend and home straight. It is an achievement that neither Seb Coe, Steve Ovett or Steve Cram could manage. BBC commentator and former 3,000 metres record- holder Brendan Foster said Holmes's double gold was the greatest achievement ever by a British athlete in the history of the Olympics. </p> <p>Her success marks a fantastic achievement for the athlete, a former army PE instructor from Pembury, Kent, whose career has been dogged by injury. </p> <p>The victories came after it emerged that Britain's Olympic boxing hero Amir Khan has turned down the chance to become an instant millionaire by deciding to remain an amateur for at least the next two years.</p> <p>Khan, 17, from Bolton, who fights for gold today and whose performances in Athens have prompted comparisons with his hero Muhammad Ali, has rejected several multi-million pound deals from promoters keen to capitalise on his series of stunning displays.</p> <p>He has told friends he wishes to remain an amateur at least until the Commonwealth Games and Boxing World Championships in 2006. He has also indicated a desire to compete in Beijing Olympics in four years' time. </p> <p>However, he is set to sign a deal with the leading British promoter Frank Warren who will stage and market Khan's fights once he eventually does turn professional. </p> <p>Warren had wanted Khan to do so right away but has agreed to wait until he is ready. Khan, virtually unknown before the Olympics, has been the outstanding performer in his sport, bewildering opponents with fast feet and fast hands. He proved he has determination when he defeated Kazakhstan's Serik Yeleuov in the semi-finals after being behind at the halfway stage. A win today will make him the youngest Olympic boxing champion since the American legend Floyd Patterson won gold in 1952. But standing in the way of the gold medal is the toughest fight of Khan's career. His opponent, the Cuban Mario Kindelan, is the reigning Olympic champion.</p> <p>Meanwhile, America's biggest Olympic hero has accused George Bush of exploiting the Games for political gain. Carl Lewis, who won nine gold medals in athletics, said the President 'was disingenuous' to use the Iraqi and Afghan teams in Athens in a TV advertisement for his re-election campaign.</p> <p>'It is funny that we boycotted the 1980 Games [in Moscow] in support of Afghanistan, and now we're bombing Afghanistan'.</p> <p>The US Secretary of State, Colin Powell, cancelled plans to stay in Athens for tonight's closing ceremony amid fear of protests. He blamed 'urgent responsibilities'.</p>",
  "<p>'Fudgy' is not a description of the promises most campaigners hope to extract from the government as the next general election approaches. But for Christine Farnish, chief executive of the National Association of Pension Funds, the fudgier the language in the manifesto the better: she's had enough of Labour's succession of 'big ideas' to persuade Britons to squirrel away more money for their retirement. </p> <p>'They've had a few plans since 1997. First there were stakeholder pensions. They weren't a bad idea, but weren't properly promoted,' she says, in the NAPF's poky offices around the corner from Westminster Abbey. 'Then they rebranded the state second pension, which seemed to be for good reasons, but you ended up with this horrible complexity.' Worst of all, she goes on, 'there is this preoccupation with means-testing as the answer to a whole lot of socio-economic problems'. </p> <p>Sharply dressed, well-coiffed and combative, Furnish is the voice of British pension funds - and doesn't bother with the dry language favoured by Andrew Smith, the Work and Pensions Minister. 'Why should I save for my pension when my next-door neighbour goes out and spends every penny he gets at the pub and he'll get the difference made up with my tax money?' she says, echoing the Tories' criticisms of means-testing, Gordon Brown's way of using the state pension system as a tool of redistribution, giving the most generous payments to the poorest. </p> <p>Instead, the NAPF would like to see a return to a simple, flat-rate, universal 'Citizens' Pension', linked to earnings so that it retains its value in the face of rising living standards. According to their calculations, it could be worth 22 per cent of average earnings if the minimum income guarantee and other payments were scrapped and bundled together. A universal index-linked scheme sounds like a left-wing idea, conjuring up barn-storming speeches by Barbara Castle; but these days it's the Tories, nudged by the shrewd David Willets, shadow work and pensions minister, who promise to restore the link with earnings. As a mother of four grown-up children, Farnish says the Citizens' Pension should not be dependent on contributions history, so would still be paid in full to women who have taken career breaks. </p> <p>She is equally uncompromising on whether we'll have to work for longer. 'You don't have to be Brain of Britain to work out the demographics: people are living 10 to 15 years longer, so the money just isn't going to go as far. It's a very difficult political issue, but has to be faced.' </p> <p>She understands that no government wants to go into an election with 'Everyone must work until they're 70' as a manifesto promise - but that's where the fudge comes in. Former CBI president Adair Turner is in charge of a Pensions Commission, which is due to report its preliminary findings in the autumn with the full report sometime in 2005. It has a broad remit to look at the sustainability of the whole system and Farnish hopes it will come up with some radical ideas. Meanwhile, as manifestos are drawn up, 'I'm hoping we see words which really are fudgy and give the government room for manoeuvre.' </p> <p>For years, pensions policy was a dusty corner, quietly inhabited by actuaries, trades unionists and amateur number-crunchers. Now successive governments have shifted more of the responsibility for retirement provision from the state on to firms. Employers, in turn, have passed some of the responsibility - and the investment risk - on to workers themselves, often switching them into 'money-purchase' pensions, in which their retirement income is determined by the vicissitudes of the markets. </p> <p>Few people noticed this seismic shift in pension provision until plunging equity markets wiped billions off the value of pension pots and increased the speed of the switch away from final salary schemes, as firms discovered gaping funding shortfalls in their final salary schemes. Meanwhile, there was a series of high-profile cases in which companies went bust and took their employees' pension rights with them, putting politicians under pressure to act. </p> <p>Slowly, pensions policy has become a live issue. which is where Farnish comes in. Instead of a life-long pensions boffin, the NAPF picked as its figurehead a former City regulator who knows how to play the political game. 'My knowledge of regulation is clearly helpful, and maybe the fact I had not had a whole career in occupational pensions helps me look at things differently.' Nevertheless, she insists that she spends plenty of time with the NAPF's members, especially pension fund trustees, keeping in touch: 'The important thing is that you provide leadership, but you get ahead of your membership at your peril.' </p> <p>It probably helps to win the trust of the average pension fund trustee that, despite her slick appearance, Farnish is at heart more the civil servant than the hot-shot City-type. Last time The Observer met her, we commented that she was brandishing a Prada handbag; today, she is keen to point out that it is just a fake - a bargain her husband brought back from a business trip to Bahrain. In fact, they were so cheap, he bought her two. </p> <p>When she goes to meet her members, fake Prada bag in hand, Farnish says she finds their morale is flagging. 'I think people feel a bit beleaguered: there's been so much change for many years that their jobs have become more difficult.' </p> <p>The government's 'Pension Protection Fund', which is about to be launched and is aimed at safeguarding the pension benefits of workers whose employers go bust, is the latest example. 'It will increase security for people who are currently still in defined benefit pension schemes, yes, but they are sadly becoming the lucky few, outside of the public sector. I guess the real question is, what about the other 15 million adults who are not in a defined benefit scheme?' </p> <p>Farnish accepts that the government was under severe pressure to act, but the industry is nervous that the measure will simply raise their costs and penalise well-funded schemes. 'The question is, how do we make the PPF durable and sustainable for the long term; our feeling is, make sure it really is a safety net: make sure it doesn't over-promise. </p> <p>'It's not just the introduction of the PPF; there are several other things going on which all point in the same direction, and are all going to make it far less attractive to keep a defined-benefit pension scheme going in future.' </p> <p>And a new 'pensions regulator' will still only be responsible for part of the sprawling sector, leaving the FSA, the Pensions Ombudsman and the Department for Work and Pensions in charge of regulating different bits of the pensions world. The government is billing it as a simplification, but according to Farnish: 'I'm on the board of the Advertising Standards Authority, and think that could be called misleading advertising.' </p> <p>When she isn't jousting with the government, Farnish has a sideline in whipping Britain's boardrooms into shape. The pension funds she represents own assets worth about \u00a3650 billion, a fifth of the stock market. Together with the Association of British Insurers, the NAPF has become a nexus for shareholder protest. </p> <p>This year's season of corporate AGMs has been much more muted than last year's, during which pharmaceuticals giant GlaxoSmithKline suffered a humiliating defeat when its pay policies were rejected by shareholders. But a series of firms - Sainsbury's, WPP, Abbey National - have felt the lash of shareholder disapproval and the NAPF has played an active role. </p> <p>'We don't mind people getting big packages when they do big, fantastic jobs,' Farmish says. 'But we do object to payments for failure and tell people about our concerns when people walk away with huge wodges of dough.' </p> <p>She says the generally more civilised tone of proceedings this year reflects the fact that companies now sound out her and her colleagues before they announce their policies. 'There has been a sea change: companies don't want to be on the front pages. We are seeing a lot coming to us long before their AGM and consulting us on issues such as remuneration and succession to the board. Last year there was a bit of a feeding frenzy. The downside was that people thought investors and companies were at war. Actually they're not, and we are all after the same thing: success.' </p> <p>With most corporate battles out of the way, Farnish is ready to turn back to her main concern - Britain's pension system - and while Whitehall has virtually emptied for August, her small team have been slogging away, researching knotty problems such as whether the age-old trust system is the right legal framework for pension funds. When the politicians return from their summer breaks, she will be waiting for them, hoping to persuade the government to stick to fudge, instead of cooking up even more complex plans. But, as she readily admits, now that pensions are so far up the political agenda, 'we've got a fight on our hands'.</p> <p><strong>Profile</strong></p> <p><strong>Name:</strong> Christine Farnish </p> <p><strong>Age:</strong> 54</p> <p><strong>Job:</strong> Chief executive, National Association of Pension Funds</p> <p><strong>Other positions:</strong> Non-executive directorships at the Office of Fair Trading and Advertising Standards Authority</p> <p><strong>Career:</strong> Consumer director FSA, 1998-2002, previously worked for Oftel, and in local government in Cambridge</p> <p><strong>Family:</strong> Married, four grown up children</p> <p><strong>Home:</strong> Cambridge</p> <p><strong>Education:</strong> Ipswich High School, Manchester University, London University</p>",
  "President Bush yesterday conceded for the first time that he had \"miscalculated\" the post-war situation in Iraq, but insisted US strategy was flexible enough to deal with the insurgency. <p>The admission, in an interview with the New York Times, made news because the president is not given to revisiting his decisions. Asked in April if he had made mistakes in office, he was unable to think of any. </p> <p>However, a report on the Abu Ghraib torture scandal, released this week, put some of the blame for the \"chaos\" at the Iraqi prison on the administration's failure to prepare adequately for an insurgency. The report, by James Schlesinger, a conservative Republican and former secretary of defence, said the Pentagon's war plans had assumed a \"benign\" postwar environment. </p> <p>In his interview, Mr Bush said he had made a \"miscalculation of what the conditions would be\" in postwar Iraq. But he said that was the result of the \"swift victory\" against the Iraqi army, which collapsed so fast that it was able to melt away and stage a guerrilla insurgency. </p> <p>Ivo Daalder, a former member of Bill Clinton's National Security Council and now an analyst at Brookings Institution, said the president's remarks showed \"a fundamental misunderstanding of the situation\". </p> <p>\"If the Iraqi defences fell quicker, we should have more troops in Baghdad. Had they had more troops there, they would have been able to deal with the insurgency more quickly and effectively,\" Mr Daalder said. \"This was not miscalculation. This was ignoring military advice.\" </p> <p>The president again refused to condemn a political advertisement by rightwing ex-soldiers - the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth - who claim the Democratic presidential challenger, John Kerry, lied about his war record. Instead, he repeated his earlier call for all advertising by such non-party groups to be banned. </p> <p>But Mr Bush made it clear he did not agree with the central message of the advertisement. \"I think Senator Kerry should be proud of his record,\" he said. \"No, I don't think he lied.\"</p>",
  "<p>George W Bush must be having nightmares about P Diddy. But he's not worried about America's inner-city youth selling drugs and killing each other for a slice of the MTV Cribs lifestyle P Diddy represents. No, Sean Combs is up to something far more worrying. He's fronting a campaign to get young African-Americans to vote. </p> <p>Combs recently appeared at the Democratic party conference in Boston as part of his Vote Or Die campaign to make voting \"sexy\". \"We're not going to get into sophisticated politics,\" he told Hilary Clinton. \"We're gonna get into a problem that we have in young America, and that is young Americans being disenfranchised. Only 36% of us have voted.\" America's black community typically votes Democrat. Even an old cowboy can do the maths - see the recent voter registration scandal in Florida. </p> <p>And Combs is not alone. American musicians currently seem intent on causing the president problems. Mary J Blige, Missy Elliot and Wyclef Jean have re-recorded Wake Up Everybody, originally by Harold Melvin &amp; The Blue Notes. The song was used in the 1976 election to encourage black voters to back Democratic candidate Jimmy Carter, who was elected. It's a bad omen for Bush. </p> <p>Less worrying, but no less annoying for the Republicans is <a href=\"http://www.punkvoter.com/\">Punkvoter.com</a>, a federation of hardcore and punk bands pushing the alternative scene to vote Kerry. \"It's official, Bush Jr is screwed!\" they declare gleefully. The fact that the Republicans are excited about rival website <a href=\"http://www.conservativepunk.com/\">Conservativepunk.com</a> seems a bit desperate. </p> <p>Likely to have a bigger impact is the Vote For Change tour organised by Bruce Springsteen and headlined by REM, Pearl Jam, arch Bush-bashers the Dixie Chicks and the Boss himself. With 34 shows in nine states over one week in October, the aim is to mobilise the Democrat vote in closely contested states. </p> <p>Ronald Reagan nearly used Springsteen's Born In The USA for his 1984 election campaign and the song is often misinterpreted as patriotic, even though it is a damning indictment of the American way. Many Springsteen fans are similarly confused by his stance. </p> <p>\"Today was my last day of being a loyal follower of your music,\" wrote a disgruntled fan on Springsteen's website. \"Why would any of us come to one of your concerts when we know we'll be subjected to a night of liberal politics instead of a night of music?\" he added, incredulously. </p> <p>Linda Ronstadt and former Eagles frontman Don Henley have also learned the hard way why Billy Bragg never cracked America. Ronstadt was booed when she dedicated a song to anti-Bush film-maker Michael Moore in Las Vegas. Hundreds of fans walked out and she was kicked out of her room by the management. Henley was booed on stage in California for offering words of support Ronstadt. He went on to play the song Political Science by Randy Newman, suggesting Bush and Vice-President Cheney might like to perform it as a duet. One of the lyrics is: \"They don't respect us so let's surprise them/We'll drop the big one and pulverize them.\" </p> <p>Steady on, Don. Don't put ideas in their heads.</p>",
  "Never mind the police searches, traffic jams, low-flying helicopters and closed bridges. This week New York's biggest challenge seems to be hysteria. <p>Delegates to the Republican convention, which begins in Madison Square Garden on Monday, will face opponents releasing swarms of mice, posing as volunteers to send old ladies in the wrong direction and hiring sex workers with Aids to seduce them, according to a columnist on the New Hampshire Sunday News, Bernadette Malone. </p> <p>Meanwhile Rupert Murdoch's New York Post is warning that \"people trained in kidnapping techniques, bombmaking and improvised munitions\" will orchestrate operations. </p> <p>It adds: \"A number of extremists with ties to the 1970s radical Weather Underground are preparing to wreak havoc.\" </p> <p>A poll by the New York Times yesterday found that more than half of New Yorkers were \"very\" or \"somewhat\" worried that there would be a terrorist attack during the week. </p> <p>The city, which is overwhelmingly Democratic, has launched a campaign to \"make nice\". The mayor, Michael Bloomberg, has offered discounts at Broadway shows and restaurants to those wearing a badge proclaiming \"peaceful protester\". </p> <p>Ms Malone is not impressed. \"By wearing these buttons and obtaining these nifty little discounts, the mice-releasers, pie-throwers and Aids-spreaders are entering into an implicit agreement with the rest of society,\" she says - \"give me $5 off a chicken entree at Applebee's and I promise not to terrorise you.\" </p> <p>\"Perhaps the Department of Homeland Security should hand out buttons that say 'Peaceful Islamic Radical'. All the scary-looking guys with fertiliser on their shoes and wires coming out of their pockets can enjoy nice-priced margaritas and reduced admission live sex shows before they blow up Madison Square Garden.\"</p>",
  "Russian investigators have finally admitted that terrorists were almost certainly responsible for the destruction of the two passenger planes which crashed on Tuesday, five days before the Chechen presidential election. <p>Traces of explosives have been found in one of the wrecks and a website linked to Islamist militants has claimed that the action was connected to Russia's war on the Chechen separatists. </p> <p>After two days in which the authorities were criticised for dismissing the possibility of terrorist involvement in the crashes, the Federal Security Service (FSB) admitted: \"During an investigation of the remains of the Tu-154 plane, traces of explosives were found.\" </p> <p>The plane came down near Rostov on Don, killing everyone on board. </p> <p>The admission was made a few hours after a little-known Islamist group claimed responsibility for the crashes, which happened within minutes of each other to two flights from Moscow, and killed a total of 89 people. </p> <p>The site said: \"Our mujahideen in the Islambouli Brigades were able to hijack two Russian planes and they were successful, despite the obstacles that faced them at the beginning.\" </p> <p>It added that the attack was \"aimed at helping our Muslim brothers in Chechnya and other Muslim countries enduring Russia's atheism.\" </p> <p>Tomorrow Chechnya is due to elect a new president to succeed Akhmad Kadyrov, who was killed in a bombing during May Day celebrations in the Chechen capital, Grozny. </p> <p>Responsibility for the two crashes is being placed at two women of Chechen origin on the passenger lists, one in each plane. </p> <p>The Islambouli Brigades' statement claimed that there were five terrorists on each plane, but the investigation is concentrating on two names: S Dzhebirkhanova and Amanta Nagayeva. </p> <p>No relatives of the women have come forward in connection with their deaths in the crashes. </p> <p>There are conflicting reports that only parts of their bodies were found in the wreckage, possibly suggesting that they had been at the centre of explosions. </p> <p>Chechen rebels have often tried to time their attacks to coincide with significant events, and the FSB said that the explosive found at the crash site - hexogen - was a type often used by Chechen terrorists. </p> <p>It was used in the series of bombings of apartment buildings in Moscow and Volgodonsk in 1999, blamed on Chechen rebels, which killed more than 300 people; and in last year's suicide bombings in Moscow, at a rock concert and a hotel near the Kremlin. </p> <p>An FSB spokeswoman said: \"The investigation process produced information which has allowed us to identify a number of people with possible links to the terrorist act that was committed on the Tu-154.\" </p> <p>Within a day of the crashes the FSB said that no traces of explosives had been found in the wreckage of the planes. </p> <p>The Russian media has heavily criticised the government for rebutting the theory of a terrorist attack; it has been alleged that the Kremlin did not want to blame terrorists until after the election. </p> <p>Other new details about the crashes underline the likelihood that they were the result of a terrorist attack. </p> <p>The pilot of the Tu-154, flying to Sochi, sent a hijack alarm signal three times, an air traffic controller in the area where the plane crashed told the Itar-Tass news agency. </p> <p>Another source told the agency that two signals were given. </p> <p>There are varying reports that an alarm signal was sent from the other plane, the Tu-134, flying to Volgograd, which crashed within a few minutes of the first plane. </p> <p>Interfax reported Victor Ilyu khin, a member of the Russian duma's (parliament) security committee, as saying that the fact that neither planes' crew managed to speak to air traffic control before crashing showed that there \"was either an explosion or the pilots were shot\". </p> <p>Examination of the wreckage in both cases pointed to explosions at the back of the planes, close to or in the toilets, according to a report given to the president's envoy in the south, Vladimir Yakovlev, the website gazeta.ru reported.</p>",
  "It was 25 years ago yesterday that Lord Mountbatten was killed by the IRA at Mullaghmore in Co Sligo, along with his 14-year-old grandson and a 17-year-old local boatman. I detest political assassination, but Dickie Mountbatten deliberately put himself - and the teenage boys in his care - at risk. <p>The Gardai implored him not to come to Classiebawn: they had intelligence that he was a target. He arrogantly dismissed their warnings - he thought he was so \"leftwing\" and so \"friendly\" towards republicanism that they would never touch him. Not very bright, he didn't understand that the Provos didn't care whether a man read the New Statesman or not. He was a high-profile Brit and that was enough reason to knock him off. </p> <p>Marking the 25th anniversary of his death, a new play about Mountbatten, by the Times critic Jeremy Kingston, is in rehearsal and will open on September 7. It's called Making Dickie Happy and it's about Mountbatten's relationship with Noel Coward, just before Dickie married Edwina Ashley in July 1922. \"Mountbatten and his young companion, Jay-Boy, arrive for a weekend at a hotel off the coast of Devon,\" says Hywel John, the handsome young actor who is playing Dickie. \"They meet Noel Coward with his companion, Lord Bungay.\" An intense weekend follows in which \"love and sexual identity and power\" are at the centre of the encounter. Dickie confides his insecurities to Noel, including a discussion of Mountbatten's alleged bisexuality. At the end, Coward understands why Mountbatten has to marry (Edwina has \u00a32m while Dickie's naval salary is \u00a3610 yearly) but feels he should be honest about his gay side too. </p> <p>Should be fun. (The play is opening at the Rosemary Branch Theatre in Islington, with hopes for a West End transfer.) Incidentally, Andrew Roberts claims in his biographical study that Mountbatten wasn't bisexual. But never mind - Edwina was. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Margaret Thatcher was undoubtedly a great prime minister. But was she a failure as a mother? Apparently she now regrets that she didn't pay more attention to young Mark's moral formation. As well she might. </p> <p>As a mother, Maggie was highly focused on being efficient and organised. She wouldn't let her children have a dog, because dogs are messy and make more work - though pets give \"emotional value\" to children. She packed them off to boarding school as soon as she could. When she made time for her kids, it was \"planned\" time, not spontaneous time. It was even suggested that she contrived to have twins because there is an economy of time involved. Daft, of course. </p> <p>She came to dote on Mark and, forgetting the disciplines of her own Methodist upbringing, indulged him in whatever he fancied. Like too many mothers, she showed preference for her son over her daughter - although it is her daughter now who seems to show the most consideration for her. </p> <p>However, it behoves none of us to judge women as mothers, since we all fail maternally in some way: we all regret the time we didn't spend, the mistakes incurred, the stupid damn choices we made - I can't believe, now, that I chose to be on a BBC TV talkshow rather than spend time with my young child. </p> <p>But, sisters, this way reaction lies. For soon we would be saying that all mothers should always put their children, not their careers, first. Mark Thatcher certainly is no credit to his mater, but if she had spent more time on his moral character, she'd never have gone into parliament - and neither would any other mother. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Elderly Americans visiting London sport big buttons proclaiming \"I'm for Kerry\" - to avoid the Bushite anti-Americanism now so rampant.

  "It is the war Moscow pretends no longer exists. Hundreds of miles south of the shredded wrecks of two airliners, blown out of the sky by suicide bombers on Tuesday night, human life is at its cheapest in the Russian republic of Chechnya. <p>Moscow's Soviet-style explanation that 90 passengers had died from a coincidental technical failure is a denial tactic they have honed in Chechnya for years. Officially, there is no war here, amid the verdant hills of Russia's southern borders where dozens of troops die each week in clashes with hardened militant separatists. Officially, life is getting better. </p> <p>Yet when Chechnya is asked tomorrow to vote for a replacement to President Akhmad Kadyrov, assassinated in May, the Kremlin will be hard put to claim that things are \"returning to normal\". Perhaps President Putin himself recognised the doublespeak when he remarked on a visit in May that the capital, Grozny, a city blasted by two Russian onslaughts, looked awful from a helicopter, and demanded that repairs be expedited. </p> <p>The city yesterday seemed more under siege than in the throes of an election. Parents collected their children from intensive care, thinking they would be safer at home than in hospital over the election. Troops and police blocked off roads. A market trader said a young man in the traditional separatist camouflage told her: \"Get out of here by 2pm, or we won't be responsible for what happens to you.\" </p> <p>Tomorrow, Chechnya will be asked to vote in Alu Alkhanov, the Chechen interior minister. When President Kadyrov was killed in a supposedly separatist bomb blast, Mr Putin mourned, yet insisted it was no setback to his policy of handing control of the war-torn republic over to pro-Moscow Chechens. He forwarded Mr Alkhanov as Mr Kadyrov's replacement. He will be the second president of Chechnya in a year and a man the separatist movement had pledged to kill. </p> <p>Few believe that Mr Alkhanov, chosen for little other than his ties to Mr Kadyrov's ruling clan, can prevent a slide into another chaotic war. The pro-Moscow Chechen security forces Mr Kadyrov created are also bickering now that they no longer have the late president's thuggish yet respected personality to bind them together. </p> <p>This private army, known as the Kadyrovtsi, is run by his son, Ramzan, and three senior commanders. Ramzan has reportedly fallen out with the most senior of these, Movladi Baisarov. He accused Mr Baisarov of withholding some of the country's lucrative oil revenue from him. </p> <p>Last Saturday night the separatist militants, a force Moscow discounts as demoralised, took over parts of Grozny and then disappeared into the night. Some accounts suggest up to 400 militants launched a coordinated attack, one police officer telling the Guardian that 58 police were killed, together with more than a dozen civilian bystanders. </p> <p>Across town, Ruslan, a police captain guarding polling station 412 with 10 men, said he came under attack at 10pm from \"60 militants\". Two of his men died before their attackers fled. </p> <p>The renewed militant offensive served to highlight the growing animosity between the two forces charged by the Kremlin with protecting the republic - Chechen troops who had fought against the Russians in the first Chechen war and Russian troops. Two attacks occurred within 100 metres of the Russian military air base, Khankala, yet the Russians did not intervene. The police captain even claimed: \"The federals let [the militants] through their checkpoints. No militant gets anywhere without their clearance\". All the same, Moscow played the incident down, a military spokesman saying only that 50 rebels had been killed. </p> <p>Yesterday, fears were rising that the Kremlin - after a blast on the Moscow metro, a presidential assassination and the downing of two passenger airliners in six months alone - would make a third, and purportedly final, show of force over Chechnya. A nervous police captain insisted: \"Terrorist acts aren't prepared here. We'll be fine. It's just Chechens in Moscow who will be heavily filtered.\" </p> <p>Yet whether Mr Putin responds by giving the extremists in the Russian army another chance to achieve a final victory over the Islamic extremists among the militants, Tuta Batayeva's eyes will probably still be red with despair. </p> <p>Militants fleeing one checkpoint on Saturday shot her son Isa, 43, dead outside their home, apparently mistaking him for a policeman. After showing how the bullet went through her son, then her garden gate, kitchen door and her fridge, she said: \"We don't know who is good or bad any more. They all look the same and nobody protects us. And whoever you vote for, they still ensure the killing goes on.\"</p>",
  "<p>CJ Hunter, the disgraced former husband of Marion Jones, was the source of the syringe containing the designer steroid tetrahydrogestrinone (THG) which sparked the doping controversy rocking world athletics. </p> <p>Trevor Graham, Jones's former coach, claims Hunter, who was banned for doping in 2000, gave the syringe to him because he wanted to see the drug give an athlete enough power to beat his ex-wife on the track. </p> <p>\"Hunter gave me the syringe,\" Graham said. \"He came to training and said to me that he wanted to become my assistant. He wanted to construct an athlete capable of beating Marion. He showed me the syringe which contained a little liquid and said to me: 'Try this and see what effect it has.'\" </p> <p>Graham said he then took the decision to pass on the syringe to the United States Anti-Doping Agency, whose investigation has led to the FBI probe into the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative (Balco), which has been accused of distributing illegal performance-enhancing drugs. </p> <p>Graham, who has nine athletes under his supervision who have tested positive for doping, took the decision to pass on the syringe \"to save the credibility of American sport\". </p> <p>Twenty-seven athletes are suspected of having received steroids from Balco. Four men, including Victor Conte, the founder and owner of Balco, have pleaded not guilty on charges of illegal steroid distribution in connection with the scandal. </p> <p>Graham, who coaches the newly crowned Olympic 100m and 200m champions Justin Gatlin and Shawn Crawford, has already admitted that he was the man who sent the syringe. </p> <p>\"I was just a coach doing the right thing at that time,\" he said. </p> <p><strong>Rogge ready to step in and back Pinsent</strong></p> <p>Matthew Pinsent, Britain's four-time gold medallist, could retain his place as a member of the International Olympic Committee, thanks to the president Jacques Rogge. </p> <p>Pinsent was controversially edged out as a member of the IOC during an election among athletes held at the Olympic village - a decision that could harm London's bid to host the 2012 games. </p> <p>He was overlooked for three athletes, Hicham El Guerrouj, Jan Zelezny and Frankie Fredericks, and an Egyptian swimmer, Rani Elwani, despite having been widely praised for having done a good job. </p> <p>There was a great deal of sympathy for Pinsent because Zelezny was among the athletes to have replaced him. He replaced the Czech in 2001 after the javelin thrower stood down to concentrate on training, having been elected in Sydney the previous year. </p> <p>Rogge, though, has the power to award seven discretionary places to athletes and Pinsent is certain to be near the top of his list. The Belgian surgeon is a huge admirer of the rower and personally congratulated him after he won his gold medal last week. </p> <p><strong>El Guerrouj feels the squueze</strong></p> <p>Before the athletics got started at the Olympics last week, Nike invited the world's press to a college on the edge of Athens where they were given a 30-minute lecture on the new technological advances made with the company's racing shoes, with star athletes Hicham El Guerrouj and Bernard Lagat there to prove the point.</p> <p>Eventually, after the techno-babble, the assembled journos were allowed to question the athletes about the business in hand at the Olympics.</p> <p>Considering Nike's great advances with its shoes, though, you would think it would make sure that the world's greatest miler of all time had a pair of spikes that fit. But after his 5,000m heat on Wednesday, El Guerrouj complained: \"My shoes were too small and they were hurting me, but I have new ones coming in tomorrow.\" So much for technological advances.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Disingenuous F1 quote of the week goes to, who else, but Michael Schumacher. Asked whether he would clinch his seventh world title tomorrow in Spa, he said: \"Rubens [Barrichello] is still able to take it away away from me.\" To wrest the championship from the German, Barrichello would have to win all five remaining races with Schumacher struggling at the rear.</p> <p><strong>Clean-cut role for Robinson</strong></p> <p>Fact and fiction blurred this week when Gillette signed a sponsorship deal to support the elite end of English rugby. Back in 1999 when Lawrence Dallaglio was turned over by the News of the World, the undercover team pretended they were from Gillette to gain the England captain's trust. Fast forward five years and the company have diplomatically chosen Jason Robinson to be the \"face\" of their campaign. </p> <p><strong>Overheard ... </strong></p> <p>\"It was like Brian Clough . . . we had a 15-minute discussion and decided he was right in the first place\" - Will Greenwood on Clive Woodward's decision not to take him on England's summer tour . . . \"He said he'll only do a press conference if we ever lose\" -Chelsea coach Steve Clarke explains why Jose Mourinho didn't show up after their midweek win . . . \"Yeah, Chelsea\" - the preferred destination of US sensation Freddy Adu .</p>",
