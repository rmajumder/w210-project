  "<p>To seasoned observers of US presidential campaigns, in which negative advertising is a dark and Machiavellian art, it probably comes as no surprise that the biggest jolt thus far to Democrat candidate and Vietnam war soldier Senator John Kerry should come from the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth. </p> <p>In a hard-hitting commercial, the shadowy group, which is funded by wealthy Texan Republican Robert Perry, blasts Kerry for \"betraying\" Vietnam veterans with his youthful anti-war protests, concluding that he \"lacks the capacity to lead\". </p> <p>A tough sell you might think, given President George W Bush's lacklustre military record during Vietnam, notably claims that he went AWOL from the Texas National Guard to help his daddy in a political campaign. But with Republican party operatives gambling that you can fool some of the people some of the time - and in a razor-close race you need only fool a few - it might seem a risk worth taking. Perception is all. </p> <p>The US media swarmed all over the Swift Boat ad, temporarily shifting debate from Bush's record as president to Kerry's in Vietnam. Yet such diversionary tactics can boomerang, given Bush's military record. This week MoveOn, the advocacy group that uses the internet to rally members and raise money for ads, often within hours, launched a rebuttal. </p> <p>\"George Bush used his father to get into the National Guard and, when the chips were down, went missing,\" runs the script. \"Now, he's allowing false advertising that attacks John Kerry, a man who asked to go to Vietnam and served with dignity and heroism.\" Twisting the knife, the ad concludes by quoting Senator John McCain, a \"true Republican war hero\", who condemned the Swift Boat ad as \"dishonest and dishonorable.\" </p> <p>The MoveOn counterpunch is part of a new breed of ad funded by \"527s\", named after the IRS tax code that allows political action committees, or Pacs, to raise cash and register voters without actually endorsing a candidate. Thus, MoveOn can stump for Kerry without violating US campaign finance laws. </p> <p>This loophole has led to an avalanche of money being directed to Democrats, much of it from tycoons such as George Soros or Steve Bing, as well as advocacy groups like MoveOn or ACT, which plan to fund ads using receipts from a series of rock concerts, featuring Bruce Springsteen and others, in October. </p> <p>Evan Tracey, who runs TNS Media Intelligence, says 527s account for $60m of the $240m spent so far on a record ad race. \"The 527s have expanded the number of people who are participating in advertising,\" says Tracey, who thinks the code will account for $100m by November. </p> <p>With 527s funding ads that promote Kerry, Republicans have filed lawsuits against this tactic, claiming it violates campaign rules. The issue will probably be decided after the election. Meanwhile, conservatives have launched their own 527-funded \"Boycott the Boss\" ad attacking Springsteen. </p> <p>Tracey predicts the total ad budget - money spent by candidates, party organisations, and Pacs - will run to between $500m-$600m, compared to $200m in 2000. The big question is whether ads work. According to the Political Standard, a newsletter published by the Alliance for Better Campaigns, 60% of voters have yet to watch one. </p> <p>Yet while Pacs like MoveOn sometimes seem to preach to the choir, this is in part because both parties want to rally their base, hoping to reach people who didn't vote in 2000. </p> <p>Nonetheless, Democrats are keen to snatch moderates from Bush. MoveOn's \"Real People\" campaign, chosen from ideas submitted by members, and shot by documentary film-maker Errol Morris, who made Fog of War and The Thin Blue Line, will run this month during the Republican National Convention. </p> <p>The 17 talking-head spots feature disillusioned Republicans who explain why they plan to dump Bush. \"We were given these ideas that there were weapons of mass destruction,\" says US Marine Sergeant Lee Buttrill. \"But where are they?\" Buttrill concludes that WMD were just a lie. \"That wasn't a proper use of American troops. It wasn't a proper use of my life, or my friends' lives, or the marines who I've seen die around me.\" </p> <p>Another spot, from US Marine Colonel Richard Dove, begins, \"I don't think President Bush is a Republican,\" before blasting the president's dismal environmental record. \"I voted for George Bush. I feel very betrayed,\" says Deborah Wood, a Texas housewife whose husband is unemployed. \"I'm still a Baptist, but I'm no longer a Republican,\" says Rhonda Nix, who thinks more needs to be spent on healthcare. And so they continue. </p> <p>But while 527s allowed Democrats to come from behind to match Bush's campaign-spending juggernaut, they also give candidates less control over ads. Thus, Kerry found himself defending Bush from MoveOn's Swift Boat rebuttal, insisting the campaign was about \"issues, not insults\". Ironically, the ad praises John McCain - who wants to plug the 527 loophole.</p>",
  "<p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> How happy was the Daily Mail about the gold medal won by our trio of sailors in the Yngling class last week? Very, if Friday's headlines were anything to go by. Page one had \"Girls with the golden smiles\"; page three read \"Golden splashdown for three blondes in a boat\"; the back page had \"Golden Girls\" as the main headline and \"Three blondes in a boat end drought\" - and on the inside back there they were again, this time under the headline \"The boating blondes\". Monkey can only wonder what would have happened if they had been brunettes. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> Monkey weather watch: A dark cloud is hanging over the ITV network centre following the flop of its latest property renovation show, The Block. A cross between Changing Rooms and Big Brother made by RDF, the top indie behind Wife Swap - what could possibly go wrong? \"It's on the wrong channel,\" says a well-placed source. \"It's not an ITV show, it's a Channel 4 show. People who watch ITV have their own houses already.\" Stephen Lambert, RDF's creative director, is on holiday. He probably needs it. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong> The good people of Stateside liberal magazine the Nation may have mixed feelings about the upcoming presidential election. Since George Bush took office, its circulation has soared 71%, making it number one in its market. The worry is that a Kerry victory may have the opposite effect, with nowhere required to vent spleen. When it comes to boosting sales, it seems, there ain't no one like Dubya. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Thump! Yet another massive book about the BBC arrives on Monkey's desk, this time by Cambridge anthropologist Georgina Born. \"A thread running through the book is exclusion from a number of places I wanted to observe. It signals closure, secrecy and the paranoia that suffuses the BBC,\" she writes in Uncertain Vision, published by Secker &amp; Warburg. To paraphrase that chap from the Fast Show: \"Paranoia, secrecy, closure? With the BBC's reputation?\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Last month, BBC chief operating officer John Smith was in an impressive hurry to get his report on Alan Yentob's expenses out - it'd be ready \"by the end of this week\" he told MediaGuardian on July 26. But now, curiously, it seems the report won't be out until September. Somehow the words \"not before Edinburgh, for God's sake\" spring perhaps unfairly to mind. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Spare a tear for Endemol emperor Peter Bazalgette, ranked only 53rd equal in Broadcast's annual Rich List and incredibly credited with a paltry personal wealth of just \u00a310m. Even more insultingly, this rates him as no richer than fellow indie hotshot Nicola Shindler - even though he's 15 years older and churns out long- running Big Brothers and Restorations, whereas she makes dramas like Queer as Folk that are gone in a flash. Where did it all go wrong?</p>",
  "<p>Sky-high oil prices are already taking their toll, eating into consumers' spending power and squeezing corporate margins; but the short-term economic pain is also a harsh reminder to the world's richest countries that they have never been able to kick their addiction to the sticky black stuff - and time is running out. </p> <p>The world has about a trillion barrels of proven oil reserves left, according to the producers' cartel, Opec. At the current rate of global consumption, that should last us about 40 years: too long to bother the traders whose frenzied buying pushed up the price of crude to record levels last week; but not long enough to ignore. Natural gas will last a bit longer - perhaps 60 years at the current rate - but is still finite. </p> <p>'We have a responsibility to our great grandchildren to do something now, in 2004,' says Andrew Oswald, professor of economics at Warwick University. 'The whole history of economics is of consumers being woefully short-sighted.' </p> <p>The developed world's dependence on crude is laid bare when the price surges, as it has over recent months, gaining more than 40 per cent since January. As the cost of a barrel of oil nudged $50 at the end of last week, boosted by renewed violence in Iraq and uncertainty about the future for Russian giant Yukos, economists were already fretting that the global economic recovery could be engulfed in an oil slick. </p> <p>'Higher oil prices act very much like a tax, reducing consumers' purchasing power for other goods and services,' explains Paul Ashworth, of Capital Economics, who calculates that every $10 per barrel increase in the oil price increases US consumers' spending on oil and petrol by about $50bn a year. And when households feel poorer and spend less - and businesses too have to meet higher energy bills - economic growth suffers. According to the International Energy Agency, a sustained $10 per barrel rise in the price of crude cuts the output of the rich OECD countries by an average of 0.4 per cent and leads to 400,000 job losses. The International Monetary Fund is expecting global growth to pick up to 4 per cent this year, but economists are nervous that the US, and the eurozone in particular, could be vulnerable. </p> <p>'Almost everything that moves in modern society moves because of oil: it remains the most influential substance in daily life,' Oswald says. When the geologist M King Hubbert warned in the 1950s that oil extraction would inevitably turn downwards, he was widely derided, but US extraction hit its peak at the end of the 1960s, and is well on its way down the 'Hubbert curve'. As their own reserves run down, the world's biggest economies become increasingly dependent on some of the most politically unstable regions - crucially, the Middle East - for the juice to run their cars and factories. </p> <p>Many countries now use less crude to produce each unit of output than they did at the time of the 1973 oil shock, when Opec grabbed the oil-thirsty western economies by the throat and prices quadrupled. But fresh industrialisation in rapidly expanding countries such as India and China and the explosion in the use of cars means total global demand is expanding at its fastest pace for 25 years. </p> <p>The current price crunch could provide a taste of things to come: analysts think prices will stay above $40 at least until the end of the year, and Paul Horsnell, head of energy research at Barclays Capital, is pencilling in an average price of $38 in 2005 - well above levels seen over recent years. 'It's a recognition that long-term prices close to $20 a barrel are too low to guarantee sufficient investment into the energy industries,' he says. Prices of around $20 a barrel in the 1990s didn't encourage the oil companies to spend on infrastructure, and the International Energy Agency has calculated that just to upgrade the network and keep supplies flowing will demand $16 trillion of investment between now and 2025. </p> <p>Heavy investment in infrastructure can help to squeeze the last drops out of the world's oilfields, but it can't overcome the underlying problem worrying far-sighted economists: fossil fuel resources are finite. In theory, as oil becomes more scarce, and prices begin to rise, entrepreneurial investors should have plenty of incentive to chuck their cash into alternative forms of energy - but in practice powerful existing interests tend to create inertia. </p> <p>Britain's businesses are already calling on the government to try and cushion the blow of rising oil prices. The fuel protests of autumn 2000 showed that one of the few things that can spur the British people into acts of mass civil disobedience is the price of a gallon of petrol. Imposing extra tax now, to pay for investment in new technology and prevent our great grandchildren from facing a crisis, could be a career-wrecking move. One of US President George Bush's campaign adverts shows 12 men riding a rickety overstretched bicycle, with a voice-over saying: 'Some people have wacky ideas. Like taxing gasoline more so people drive less. That's John Kerry.' </p> <p>Despite his insistence that concerted government action is needed now to prepare for an oil-free future, Oswald thinks the current crunch will not cause enough economic pain to force a serious change of approach. </p> <p>'We need global coordination to face up to this,' he says. And there is only one way to force consumers and firms to envisage alternatives: 'The price has got to be much higher.' To make that happen, he believes: 'I think it will take some sort of crisis, maybe military, maybe climate-related.' </p> <p>Environmentalists, who attack fossil fuel use because of its impact on global warming, agree. They argue for the 'polluter pays' principle, on which the user of fuel has to meet the wider costs to the environment, in global warming and so on - what economists call the 'externalities'. </p> <p>'The impact of climate change is going to be economically significant, but at the moment that doesn't feed through to energy prices,' says Mike Childs, campaign director at Friends of the Earth, who would like to see a tax on carbon use. </p> <p>The government has acted to set targets for the proportion of energy that must come from renewable sources such as wind and solar power, in line with its promises under the Kyoto Climate Change Treaty - 10 per cent by 2010, and 15 per cent by 2015. </p> <p>It is also deciding how to implement European directives on cutting sulphur emissions from Britain's creaking coal-fired power stations. But with all Britain's nuclear power stations in the costly process of being decommissioned, and doubts about the capacity of wind power to take the place of coal and gas, no one has suggesteda viable plan to cope with the longer-term running down of oil resources. </p> <p>Meanwhile, like all addicts, oil analysts focus on the short term: avidly reading this week's production figures and following the impact on prices of elections, corporate upheavals and wars. And, just as they were during the larger shocks of the 1970s, consumers and companies are similarly focused on the present. They will watch their petrol tanks and fuel bills mount until the oil infrastructure catches up with demand and prices fall back a bit. Then they will carry on much as before. </p> <p>The chances of the world's wealthy nations weaning themselves off oil is still, as both the environmentalists and the economists agree, a pipe dream.</p>",
  "<p>The cost of a barrel of oil could surge through $60 within weeks, inflicting heavy damage on the global economy, analysts warn. Prices on the oil markets have hit record levels in 15 of the past 16 trading days, breaking through $49 on Friday. </p> <p>Bruce Evers, oil analyst at Investec, said: 'My gut feeling is that prices will stay much higher, much longer than people think. There's huge momentum behind it: $60 is certainly plausible.' </p> <p>With little spare capacity in the global system, and the threat of rebel attacks on oil installations in Iraq jeopardising Middle East supplies, economists say prices will not fall until the rising cost of energy chokes off demand. </p> <p>'If there's a cold winter and the situation in the troublespots continues, prices are bound to get higher,' said Muhammad Ali Zainy, senior energy economist at the Centre for Global Energy Studies. </p> <p>Prices so far this year have averaged $38, up from $32 last year, which analysts say could turn the temporary 'soft spot' in the US economy identified by Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan into a prolonged slowdown. </p> <p>President Bush is betting on an economic upturn to help secure his re-election, but figures to be released this week are widely expected to show that the US expanded much more slowly than first thought in the second quarter of the year. </p> <p>Analysis by Washington-based think-tank the Economic Policy Institute shows that unemployment is a persistent problem, despite Bush's tax-cutting 'jobs and growth' strategy. Most states have fewer jobs than they did three years ago, at the beginning of the recession which followed the dotcom boom. </p> <p>'Many of the areas that have lost jobs are the key battleground states which Bush needs to win,' said EPI president Larry Mishel. 'The economy's muddling through with modest jobs growth, which means that we are not going to drive unemployment down.' </p> <p>Thirty-one states have lost jobs since March 2001, the EPI says. They include the President's home state of Texas, where there are now 103,300 fewer people employed.</p>",

Two weeks later, her sister, Kerry, introduces her new boyfriend: it's Brendan, whom her parents have already happily accepted as 'family'. </p> <p>But soon Brendan starts his hideous mind games, inevitable tragedies ensue, and the listener is quickly enmeshed. Did Miranda's troubled brother really kill himself? Did her best friend really slip and drown in her bath? Will Miranda be destroyed by her guilt at being the 'carrier' of the toxic Brendan into the lives of those she loves? Although not all the complexities of the plot are plausibly worked out, the story is totally gripping. </p> <p>Flosnik's reading of the narrative with her northern 'A' jars, as the story is rooted in London, but the dialogue is more successful. She gives Brendan a chilling and creepy voice; and the change in the speech of Miranda's parents before and after their son's death is presented with sympathy and skill.</p>",
  "<p><strong>I find still water very difficult to drink. I've recently discovered sparkling water and can't get enough of the stuff, but is it doing me as much good as still?</strong><br>Sarah </p> <p>Scientific research has linked higher intakes of water with a reduced risk of a range of conditions, including kidney stones, heart disease and certain forms of cancer. </p> <p>Unfortunately, none of the research in this area has assessed the relative merits of sparkling and still water. Some natural health practitioners argue that still is better, one reason for this being that the bubbles in sparkling water are carbon dioxide - a gas which, generally, the body is trying to get rid of. Also, from an evolutionary perspective, it makes sense to drink still mineral water, as this is the form of water to which we are likely to be best adapted. </p> <p>My own view is that any difference between the effects of still versus sparkling mineral water is likely to be marginal, and much less significant than the difference between the effects of drinking mineral water (of any form) compared with, say, soft drinks. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> If you have any issues you would like Dr Briffa to address in his column, please email <br>him on <a href=\"mailto:john.briffa@observer.co.uk\">john.briffa@observer.co.uk</a>.
