  "After the debacle in Florida four years ago, former president Gerald Ford and I were asked to lead a blue-ribbon commission to recommend changes in the American electoral process. After months of concerted effort by a dedicated and bipartisan group of experts, we presented unanimous recommendations to the president and Congress. The government responded with the Help America Vote Act of October 2002. Unfortunately, however, many of the act's key provisions have not been implemented because of inadequate funding or political disputes. <p>The disturbing fact is that a repetition of the problems of 2000 now seems likely, even as many other nations are conducting elections that are internationally certified to be transparent, honest and fair. </p> <p>The Carter Centre has monitored more than 50 elections, all of them held under contentious, troubled or dangerous conditions. When I describe these activities, either in the US or in foreign forums, the almost inevitable questions are \"Why don't you observe the election in Florida?\" and \"How do you explain the serious problems with elections there?\" </p> <p>The answer to the first question is that we can monitor only about five elections each year, and meeting crucial needs in other nations is our top priority. (Our most recent ones were in Venezuela and Indonesia, and the next will be in Mozambique.) A partial answer to the other question is that some basic international requirements for a fair election are missing in Florida. </p> <p>The most significant of these are: </p> <p><b><b>\u00b7</b></b> A non-partisan electoral commission or a trusted and non-partisan official who will be responsible for organising and conducting the electoral process before, during and after the actual voting takes place. Although rarely perfect in their objectivity, such top administrators are at least subject to public scrutiny and responsible for the integrity of their decisions. Florida voting officials have proved to be highly partisan, brazenly violating a basic need for an unbiased and universally trusted authority to manage all elements of the electoral process. </p> <p><b><b>\u00b7</b></b> Uniformity in voting procedures, so that all citizens, regardless of their social or financial status, have equal assurance that their votes are cast in the same way and will be tabulated with equal accuracy. Modern technology is already in use that makes electronic voting possible, with accurate and almost immediate tabulation and with paper ballot printouts so all voters can have confidence in the integrity of the process. There is no reason these proven techniques, used overseas and in some US states, could not be used in Florida. </p> <p>It was obvious that in 2000 these basic standards were not met in Florida, and there are disturbing signs that once again, as we prepare for a presidential election, some of the state's leading officials hold strong political biases that prevent necessary reforms. </p> <p>Four years ago, the top election official, the Florida secretary of state, Katherine Harris, was also the co-chair of the Bush-Cheney state campaign committee. The same strong bias has become evident in her successor, Glenda Hood, who was a highly partisan elector for George Bush in 2000. Several thousand ballots of African Americans were thrown out on technicalities in 2000, and a fumbling attempt has been made recently to disqualify 22,000 African Americans (likely Democrats), but only 61 Hispanics (likely Republicans), as alleged felons. </p> <p>The top election official has also played a leading role in qualifying Ralph Nader as a candidate, knowing that two-thirds of his votes in the previous election came at the expense of Al Gore. She ordered Nader's name be included on absentee ballots even before the state supreme court ruled on the controversial issue. </p> <p>Florida's governor, Jeb Bush, naturally a strong supporter of his brother, has taken no steps to correct these departures from principles of fair and equal treatment or to prevent them in the future. </p> <p>It is unconscionable to perpetuate fraudulent or biased electoral practices in any nation. It is especially objectionable among us Americans, who have prided ourselves on setting a global example for pure democracy. With reforms unlikely at this late stage of the election, perhaps the only recourse will be to focus maximum public scrutiny on the suspicious process in Florida. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Former US president Jimmy Carter is chairman of the Carter Centre in Atlanta <br> <i>\u00a9Washington Post</i></p>",
  "He was bigger, she was deeper. He drew himself as a faun, she drew herself as a nun. He drank, ate and rollicked on an epic scale, she sometimes starved alone in her room. Both enormously admired one another's work. <p>A comparison of Gwen John and her brother Augustus opens at Tate Britain this week, the first since their deaths. \"This was supposed to be a small, rather quiet exhibition, but the level of interest is extraordinary,\" said the Tate's director, Stephen Deuchar, yesterday. \"We may be in for a bit of a shock.\" </p> <p>The curator, David Fraser Jenkins, said: \"His best portraits are astonishing, better and better the longer you look at them, while her late work shows an extraordinarily modern engagement with the whole process of painting.\" </p> <p>The exhibition includes her only known image of him, in the background of a group of Slade art school friends, leaning on a mantelpiece wearing a straw hat at a rakish angle. </p> <p>Gwen's meekness, as seen in her brother's portraits and in her selfportraits, was deceptive. When one critic called her pictures \"quiet and sad\", speculating that the artist must be too, Augustus wrote to protest. </p> <p>He did not point out, as he might have, that she had earned her living as a nude model in Paris, and was not only the model but the lover of the sculptor Rodin. </p> <p>For most of their lives it seemed beyond question that he was the greater. She died in 1939, and he in 1961. </p> <p>Since then her reputation has risen steadily, while his has gone into freefall - partly because his output was so vast, and the quality so varied, that even Mr Fraser Jenkins calls some of his female portraits \"slickly over-sexed\". </p> <p>The reversal in fact began in 1926, in the only joint exhibition in their lifetimes; for the first time, her work was more admired than his. Country Life said: \"She is a sort of modern Vermeer.\" </p> <p>The Tate Britain show has a wall of works by both artists of \"Dorelia\", Dorothy McNeill. She was model, muse, cook, costumier, mother of a tribe of children, and general nanny to Augustus and his wife, Ida - but she also ran off with Gwen to France for a year. </p> <p>Towards the end of her life, Gwen painted small studies in muted colours. Augustus often painted to match his lifestyle. Two vast works are on show: Galway, a triptych in the Tate's possession for 80 years but rarely shown due to lack of space; and The Mumpers (an old word for beggars), a vast, brilliant canvas that is awkward for its museum in Detroit to show and has not been seen in Britain since 1915. In its day, The Mumpers was compared, favourably, with Matisse's The Dance, now seen as a quintessential image of 20th century art. </p> <p>However, not everyone agreed, and his sitters were not always enraptured with how he saw them. In 1907 Lady Gregory commissioned him to portray WB Yeats. He displayed the poet in an open collared shirt, with sensuous red lips, glittering dark eyes, and a lock of black hair falling over a noble white brow - \"every inch the poet of the twilight\", as John recorded. Yeats was appalled: the work, he said, made him \"a sheer tinker; drunken, unpleasant and disreputable\". </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Gwen John and Augustus John, Tate Britain until January 9</p>",
  "The US army is considering shortening tours of duty for its soldiers in Afghanistan and Iraq as a way of persuading them to re-enlist, it was reported yesterday. <p>As the insurgency in Iraq intensifies, military authorities are finding it difficult to recruit troops or to persuade soldiers to extend their service. </p> <p>The shortage is acute among military reserves and the National Guard, the so-called weekend warriors, who between them account for about half the US forces in Iraq. Some military officials say the Pentagon will be confronted with a recruitment crisis unless combat tours are shortened. But with US forces overstretched, it is unclear how that can be achieved. </p> <p>\"All the army leadership agrees that 12 months is too long,\" Lieutenant General Steven Blum, chief of the National Guard Bureau, told the New York Times. \"We need to move to a shorter rotational base.\" </p> <p>The 12-month tours are also causing friction among US forces in Iraq. While members of the US army regularly stay for 12 or even 15 months, marines are rotated home within six or seven months - a discrepancy which has already drawn the attention of the defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld. </p> <p>Some army officers say the longer deployments have the advantage of continuity, giving troops more time to learn about local conditions and more time at home between deployments. </p> <p>But Gen Blum and others believe the longer tours may contribute to long-term structural problems. </p> <p>Orders which barred reservists and members of the National Guard from leaving the military when their contracts expired have also caused much resentment. </p> <p>But it is unclear how the US military, which has 138,000 troops in Iraq, will be able to maintain its strength without the 12-month deployments. </p> <p>The National Guard said last week that it had failed to meet its recruitment targets for the first time in a decade, bringing in 5,000 fewer soldiers than its goal of 56,000. </p> <p>Officials blamed the shortfall on the reluctance of troops on active duty to transfer into the National Guard after completing their assignments, for fear of being sent back to Iraq. </p> <p>Although President George Bush and Iraq's interim prime minister, Ayad Allawi, say that \"freedom is winning\" in Iraq, the Pentagon acknowledges that forces in Iraq and Afghanistan are overstretched and that it will not be able to meet its commitments at current force levels. </p> <p>Meanwhile, Colin Powell, the secretary of state, said at the weekend that Iraq's security situation would deteriorate during next January's elections.\"Yes, it's getting worse, and the reason it's getting worse is that they are determined to disrupt the election,\" Mr Powell told ABC television. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Two American soldiers have been charged with murdering an Iraqi civilian, the third pair of soldiers from the 1st Battalion 41st Infantry Regiment to be charged with murder in two weeks, the US military said yesterday.</p>",
  "<p>Merino sheep are much heavier than they look. I only know this because I got up close and personal with one a few months ago. There were a lot of grunts and shoves but no telephone numbers were exchanged. </p> <p>It took all my strength to haul the dung-covered animal from the back of an old Land Rover up a flight of wooden steps and into a shed. It was especially tough because it was dark and my only source of light was the car headlights. </p> <p>This was not a stag party dare but sheep shearing time at an outback station in New South Wales - and far more fun than any blokey weekend I've been on. </p> <p>Shearing was one of my newly acquired skills at a five-day jackaroo school, where you learn about rural life and how to be a cowboy. It's an antipodean experience as far removed from beach and surf culture as you can imagine. Best of all, no one called you \"dude\" and there was not a celebrity in sight. </p> <p>It is not for half-hearted city slickers who want a quick snapshot of cowboy chic: this is fun but also gruelling, and you are going to get covered in dirt. No matter how many showers I had, I never removed the thin layer of dust that got everywhere. Jackaroos and jillaroos are Australia's equivalents to the cowboys and cowgirls of America's Wild West, and these schools are increasingly popular after Prince Harry trained to be a farm hand in Queensland last year as part of his gap year. </p> <p>I joined 25 young travellers much further south, at Australia's largest and longest running school for budding cowboys and girls in Leconfield, a 7,000-acre cattle ranch near Tamworth, Australia's country music capital, in New South Wales. The farm is located at the end of a 10-mile dirt track and is about as rural and isolated as you can get - a long way from all those sleek, glittery bars back in Sydney. </p> <p>My fellow trainees were mostly backpackers, Aussie, British, Dutch and German, and all, like me, city dwellers hellbent me on a week's crash course in rural matters - though one lady's ambition was to become a vet. The school can't promise to transform you into jackaroo overnight, but it does teach you the fundamentals of farm life. </p> <p>At the end of the week, you will feel rugged and invigorated, and it's likely you'll walk differently - though mostly because you are saddle-sore and exhausted. If you're used to luxury and sunning yourself by a pool or crave all-night drinking games in backpackers' hostels, this probably is not the break for you: there are washroom duties, washing-up rotas and accommodation is on the budget side of basic, on bunk beds in a corrugated iron shack. However, this rustic living just adds to the fun. If you can handle all that, you'll have a better time than the contestants on the new reality TV series The Farm, where celebrities swap the city for life on a working farm. </p> <p>My jackaroo school was a bit like a celebrity free version of that - Big Brother without the misguided egos. We were just average Joes and Joannas without any desire to be famous, just to learn a bit about the bush. </p> <p>It was early to bed and even earlier to rise. We were woken each morning at 6am with loud rock music - a similar tactic to the one used US Marines used to depose the Panamanian dictator General Noriega. </p> <p>We were immediately thrown in at the deep end of the realities of life on a cattle station, from mustering and shearing sheep to horseshoeing, whip-cracking, lassoing and mending fences; oh, yes, and improving pasture, which involves dousing huge swaths of deadly blackberry bushes with gasoline and letting go with a match - a pyromaniacs dream. </p> <p>While the jackaroo course is a practical introduction to country life, it is not all hard graft: we worked from 7.30am until 6.00pm but there was plenty of time to play up to the cowboy image. It was great to act the part in those leather chaps and Akubra hats. </p> <p>While mustering sheep on horseback, we traversed steep-sided hills and winding creeks to round them into a herd. I didn't really pull my weight on this because I was frequently distracted by the stunning surrounding vistas, with kangaroos bouncing across distant hillsides. The blazing winter sunshine was fierce and bleached a lot of the sprawling cattle station. </p> <p>We were taught natural horsemanship by our mentor, Tim Skerrett, whose family has owned Leconfield ranch since 1914. The school started in 1983 with the idea of training young Australians, but the majority of students nowadays are backpackers wanting an authentic experience of the Australian bush. Apparently I needed to learn to dominate my horse. \"Take charge - let them know who's boss,\" Tim said. \"The sneakier you are around horses, the more spooked they get.\" </p> <p>Until this moment my knowledge of equine matters had been limited to an annual flutter on the Grand National. But when it came to whip-cracking I finally found something I had a natural flair for. </p> <p>Outdoors all day, we certainly earned our dinner. We devoured huge meals cooked al fresco over a campfire. We were bushed, but not too tired to enjoy amazing sunsets.</p> <p>Afterwards, we remained huddled around the campfire, swapping stories from our respective countries and debating everything from the Iraq war to whether Vegemite was better than Marmite. I waited for a re-enactment of the flatulence scene from Blazing Saddles but it never came. The alternative was far better: above us were the clearest skies I had ever seen, a light show of shooting stars and satellites and a silence I had only dreamed of at home. </p> <p>A mixture of hard work and good fun, the jackaroo school does not shy away from the hard realities of farm life. For many students the most challenging part of the course was when we were invited to watch a sheep being slaughtered. This was optional and only a handful stayed to watch. I peeked through a gap in my fingers. </p> <p>Our teachers looked like Australia's Marlboro men, straight out of central casting: they looked like cowboys, spoke like cowboys; and even walked like cowboys. They were no-nonsense, grounded folk whose word was their bond. Rugged men such as Tim Skerrett and Steve Bokady had cowboys' names, big hands and firm handshakes, and looked like they had spent every day since they were infants doing manly activities outdoors. They were a great set of chaps, and good teachers.</p> <p>And their lifestyle was infectious. The more I thought about it, the more I wanted to adopt the outback life. But just when I was getting on first-name terms with my favourite mount, it was time to leave. </p> <p>You vow to live off the land when you get home, though in your heart you know you won't get any further than repeats of The Good Life. But that's not the point, as the best travel is about creating hopes and dreams - even if they only last for a week. </p> <p>Back in south London I soon returned to the melee at Sainsbury's, but all is not lost: I'm definitely getting one of those great big bush hats.

  "In late August and early September, as John Kerry's campaign for president hit one low point after another, bloggers of all stripes took to the web with pointed political advice for the candidate. They told him how he should attack Bush and how he should hone his message. They even wrote sample speeches for the candidate. <p>On September 13, for instance, Zackpunk, a regular contributor to the political junkie website <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/\">Daily Kos</a>, wrote in his \"diary\" - a kind of miniblog within the larger site - that while listening to Al Franken on the radio, two disparate facts about the Bush presidency fused together in his mind. One was the story, first reported by Bob Woodward, that when Bush told his secretary of state, Colin Powell, that he planned to invade Iraq, Powell warned the president that \"you'll own it all\". The other was Bush's campaign promotion of an \"ownership society.\" </p> <p>These two facts, Zackpunk said, left a \"huge opening for Kerry\", with an ideal speech from the senator looking something like this: \"Mr President, Colin Powell told you about this war that 'if you break it, you own it'. And now you're going around talking about an 'ownership society'. Well, Mr President, let me tell you what you own. A million jobs lost. You own that. A thousand soldiers lost. You own that. 1.4 million new people living below the poverty line. You own that. 1.2 million less people covered by health insurance. You own that. A 17% medicare increase. You own that. Health care costs skyrocketing. You own that. The tax burden increasing amongst the middle class. You own that. Mr President, if you want to talk about an ownership society, let's talk about what you own.\" </p> <p>The speech was a powerful, specific, fact-filled indictment of Bush. And on Daily Kos, when someone writes something as brilliant as that in a diary, other readers begin noticing, and if it's good enough the post can land on the Kos front page. That's what happened in this case, and Kerry's campaign seemed to notice. In a speech two days later, Kerry said, \"At that convention in New York the other week, President Bush talked about his ownership society. Well, Mr President, when it comes to your record, we agree - you own it.\" Kerry went on to enumerate Bush's mistakes and label his term the \"excuses presidency, never wrong, never responsible, never to blame\". </p> <p>It's possible that the Kerry people came upon their speech independently of Daily Kos, but Markos Moulitsas Zuniga, the site's owner, says that he suspects Kerry is listening. \"It's not that they're listening to Markos,\" he says. \"They're realizing that there's this huge community out there that has good ideas. There are 400 or 500 diary entries a day. If one in a thousand diary entries has something of value, that's a good idea every couple of days.\" </p> <p>Today, it seems that every online political junkie secretly - if not openly - believes he's James Carville, a strategist possessed of such uncontested political genius that a particular candidate would be crazy not to listen to his advice, especially if that particular candidate is John Kerry. It's possible to find people on the web who'll claim that they could do at least as good a job in winning political races as the veteran consultants on the inside. So what if these people have never worked in any actual campaign? At least some of them were warning, months ago, that the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth would be a problem for Kerry and that he should respond hard and fast - an idea that Kerry's team would have been wise to consider. </p> <p>How is it possible that amateur political junkies are potentially having an effect on actual campaigns? The answer is that the internet has fundamentally changed politics as we know it. There is just so much out there that we didn't have access to four years ago: polling data, fundraising data, media-buy data; instant access to every TV ad and press release and unguarded gaffe and well-timed leak to jolt the campaign; insider dish on what the media's covering and what it's not covering and why; and perhaps most fun of all, there are massive online communities in which hundreds of thousands of people submit their mostly corny, often silly and sometimes unimaginably brilliant ideas for how this candidate or that should run his campaign. \"As a political junkie,\" says Moulitsas, \"this is heaven for me.\" </p> <p>\"I don't think that most people delude themselves into thinking they're actually James Carville,\" says Michael Cornfield, senior research consultant at the <a href=\"http://www.pewinternet.org/\">Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project</a>. \"But for many of them it's gratifying to pore over the poll data and all this other data and think about what you would have done. You know what I'd compare it to? It's like fantasy football. I don't mean to suggest that people are trivialising it, but politics does have these game-like aspects to it, and it can be gratifying in a number of ways to play the game.\" </p> <p>Jerome Armstrong, who runs the popular left-leaning blog, <a href=\"http://www.mydd.com/\">MyDD.com</a>, is 40 years old, and for much of his life he followed politics only \"on the periphery,\" he says. Only in the last few years has he come to see both the necessity and the excitement of civic participation, and in that short time he's taken to the game with all the gusto of a natural. </p> <p>Armstrong was an early fan of Howard Dean, and Dean's campaign manager, Joe Trippi, was an early fan of Armstrong's blog; the match was eventually consummated in Burlington, Vermont, where, during Dean's rise and fall, Armstrong decamped to work for the campaign. Now Armstrong is a full-fledged political consultant. He and Moulitsas have set up a firm to advise politicians on how to use the web to outmanoeuvre their opponents, much as Armstrong (and many others) helped Dean to do in his campaign. </p> <p>Armstrong's interest in web campaigns is genuine, and given his background with Dean, he is just as qualified, if not more so, as any veteran consultant to advise a candidate looking for online expertise. But Armstrong has educated himself in much more than the mechanics of web campaigns. Like Moulitsas, he's a political polymath, the kind of guy who can recite every competitive House race this year, and if you've got time he may well tell you the various candidates' fundraising records, their support in the party, and recent polling data for their race. </p> <p>\"I've been looking at the House races for about the last three or four days,\" he said last week, launching into a detailed discussion of the Democratic party's chances of regaining control of the chamber in November. \"It looks really close. If the whole thing goes like 3% toward the Democrats, they could win like 20 seats.\" (That's just his top-line estimate. See here ... and here for a much, much more in-depth analysis.) </p> <p>Armstrong's House forecast is based on polling data he's culled from news sources all over the web, and fundraising data he got from the <a href=\"http://www.fec.gov/\">federal election commission (FEC)'s website</a>. \"What I've been doing is, I've been looking at where the Republican attack money is going,\" Armstrong says. \"Like I've been looking into how the Republican leadership PACs [political action committees] are distributing money, which House races they're targeting. That way you see which races are competitive.\" </p> <p>Four years ago, it may have been possible to collect this data, but it would have been more difficult than it is today, and, anyway, without the distribution platform of blogs, doing this kind of research would have been pointless then. </p> <p>\"Ten years ago you'd have to go down to the FEC and get their filings and put it all in a big book and bring it back,\" Armstrong notes. \"Maybe like 100 people in the country would have seen it. This year, here I am just a blogger getting this stuff, and since I've got the time and the resources I can look into this.\" </p> <p>Moulitsas concurs. On the web, it's springtime for number crunchers. \"I've always been a political junkie,\" he says. \"But never before like this. There's no way I could have kept up with a Senate race in South Dakota, or a House race in Nevada, it just was not possible. Now, every newspaper's online, and with <a href=\"http://news.google.com/news?q=federal+election+commission+&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wn\">Google News</a> I can have all this stuff e-mailed to me when news happens. I've set up all sorts of keywords. I'm always getting all this stuff. It's a whole different environment.\" </p> <p>In the grand scheme of technological progress, increased access by bloggers to political information isn't the most astounding development. Glenn Reynolds, the University of Tennessee law professor who runs the popular, rightish blog <a href=\"http://www.instapundit.com/\">Instapundit</a>, notes that \"if you look at a more general picture of the world recently, the difference between amateurs and professionals has vanished in a whole lot of ways. For instance, look at music - it used to be you only knew about studio stuff if you were a serious musician. The amateur would never know about it. But now you can set these things up at home. The insider tricks aren't insider tricks anymore, now that outsiders have access to the knowledge\". </p> <p>A similar thing has occurred in film and photography with the advent of digital imaging, or in journalism with the advent of the web and of blogs themselves. Why should political strategy be any different? </p> <p>The web's metamorphosis into a haven for armchair strategists seems all the more natural when you consider the fetishisation of political operatives that has increasingly become the obsession of all media covering modern elections. It's well established that there are not nearly as many stories about policy today as there are about campaigns and the personalities who people them. John Kerry's capacity to run a presidential campaign is deemed at least as important as his capacity to, you know, run the country. </p> <p>The success of the DA Pennebaker film The War Room, and K Street, and especially The West Wing - a TV show created by a political junkie as a gift to the rest of us afflicted with the bug - just underlines the point. One of the hottest video games in recent months has been <a href=\"http://www.politicalmachine.com/game.asp?c=1&amp;u=0\">The Political Machine</a>, which is no doubt the first game ever to feature as its primary villain the vexing mathematics of the electoral college. And finally, for proof that we are ever more concerned about the horse race rather than the issues of the presidential race, look no further than the talking heads on cable news, constantly plumbing the depths of a sole overarching political-strategy story line, \"What should candidate X do next?\" </p> <p>The amateurs playing politics online often come off smarter than those on TV, and you can interact with them, which makes playing the game fun. Because they are now actually involved in assisting political campaigns, it wouldn't be correct to include Moulitsas and Armstrong in this group of \"amateurs\". But they're definitely not professionals in the mould of the veteran experts advising either of the presidential campaigns or the political parties, and certainly their readers - who are apprised of much of the information that they collect - are amateurs. In this sense, what we're seeing in this election cycle is truly novel. Amateurs, the political junkies whose interest in politics used to go unfulfilled, now find themselves holding some of the mightiest data in politics, the kind of dish they used to drool over. </p> <p>It would be a bit too credulous to conclude that these developments will prove to be a boon to political campaigns and, more pressingly, to the quality of American politics. So far, bloggers and the readers of blogs have been most influential to campaigns through fundraising - especially for Dean, Kerry, Bush and many congressional candidates - and, in a few instances, they've affected the news cycle, most recently in their flogging of CBS News' now-discredited Bush National Guard memos. In the Dean campaign, Trippi and other advisers professed to rely on the readers of the official <a href=\"http://deancalltoaction.blogspot.com/\">Howard Dean blog</a> for at least some strategic advice. We'll never know if this advice ultimately helped Dean, propelling him to a position that he never would have attained without help from the bloggers, or whether, in the end, the cultish Dean movement drove people away from Dean and did in his candidacy. </p> <p>There is no easy way to measure the \"quality\" of the political strategy generated on the web in the comment section of sites like MyDD or DailyKos. \"It's all over the map,\" notes John Judis, the New Republic editor whose last book, The Emerging Democratic Majority, written with the political analyst Ruy Teixeira, serves as the basis for the popular blog <a href=\"http://www.emergingdemocraticmajorityweblog.com/donkeyrising/\">Donkey Rising</a>. \"It's just like in sports. Who's to say what's a good idea and what's not?\" </p> <p>But Judis also believes that much of the strategy offered up by denizens of lefty blogs is earnest, \"flowing from a genuine political commitment\", and is not out of the \"the sheer pursuit of consultancy as an abstract skill\". As such, he says, it wouldn't hurt political campaigns to monitor some of what's going on online. </p> <p>There is evidence that this is occurring, as witnessed by Zackpunk's ownership speech. But even if the blog audience does not serve up fresh strategic advice every day, it's at least useful to look at what the people online are saying if you're trying to attract them to your campaign, says Stirling Newberry, who blogs at the <a href=\"http://www.bopnews.com/\">Blogging of the President</a>. </p> <p>\"People are expert consumers, and it's much easier to find out what people really think about something like a consumer product if you observe them,\" Newberry says. If you go to a fan site devoted to motorcycles, you'll find out what's on the minds of potential motorcycle consumers. Likewise, if you go to a site devoted to politics, you'll find out what's bothering potential consumers of a political message - and you'll discover their problems even if their specific ideas or suggestions for improving that product aren't very astute. \"People really talk about the things they're worried about,\" Newberry says. \"A lot of people say that by watching these sites Kerry should have known that Swift Boats were going to be very important. He should have done something.\" </p> <p>One problem with amateurs holding the tools of professionals, though, is that they may not quite understand how to use them. During the past few weeks, there's been a spirited discussion between some bloggers over how to interpret and account for the volatility in some presidential campaign polls, especially a recent Gallup poll showing a huge Bush lead. Ruy Teixeira, the polling expert at Donkey Rising, has argued convincingly that the Gallup poll is off because it over-sampled Republicans in its calculation of voters \"likely\" to cast a ballot in November. Mickey Kaus, the resident blogger at <a href=\"http://slate.msn.com/\">Slate</a>, called that thesis nonsense, and offered just as convincing a theory to support Gallup's numbers. </p> <p>Such a fight, let's note, was unlikely to have come up four years ago. Then, we didn't have as many polls with which to compare one single aberrant poll, and far fewer people were interested in the mechanics of polling. We've now got inside access to dozens of polls and sites that collect and analyse polls, from the indispensable <a href=\"http://electoral-vote.com/\">Electoral-Vote.com</a> to <a href=\"http://pollingreport.com/\">PollingReport.com</a> to <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/\">Real Clear Politics</a> to Donkey Rising. If you're an online politics junkie these days, you likely consume at least half a dozen new polls for breakfast each morning. </p> <p>But what's an amateur to do in the case of a real question about the proper way to use these new tools? Maybe there is a place online for real experts, people who specialise in such previously cloistered fields as opinion polling. Online, you sometimes see some very bitter, partisan fights over polls, with no small number of people charging that certain surveys are rigged. </p> <p>Looking over this world recently, Mark Blumenthal, a veteran Democratic political consultant and pollster, decided that his professional voice needed to be added to the mix. He didn't blame the amateurs for their occasional ignorance about polling. It's not their fault, he says, that his industry hasn't engaged with the people online. But now, he adds, it's time for that collaboration. \"My sense is there is a role for a source of information about polling. There's all this talk about manipulation, a conspiracy of the right or the left. Meanwhile, there's a community of social scientists who deeply care about how to draw a random sample, about getting things right. And the two groups aren't really talking to each other.\" </p> <p>The best way to get the two sides talking to each other, Blumenthal recognised, would be by starting a blog of his own to discuss the ins and outs of polls. That's what he did last week with a site he calls <a href=\"http://mysterypollster.typepad.com/main/\">Mystery Pollster</a>, and on his first day, Blumenthal got a link from Mickey Kaus and 15,000 page views.</p> <p>Blumenthal says he wants the site to serve as a bridge between the professional political consultants and the amateurs who populate the web, and judging by the comments people have left him so far, he says that may happen. \"It's an experiment,\" he says of the project. \"A six-week experiment, and then we'll see what happens. It sure does look like it's going to take up all my spare time until then.\" </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> This article has been provided by Salon through a special arrangement with Guardian Newspapers Limited.<br>\u00a9 Salon.com 2004</p> <p>Visit the Salon site at <a href=\"http://www.salon.com\">salon.com</a></p>",
  "<b>How do you feel about the Liberal Democrats in general? Are they a credible party of government? What are you hoping to see at the Labour and Conservative conferences?</b> <p>It seems incredible today that, historically, the two main parties were the Tories and the Whigs, and that Labour is a relatively new concept (New New Labour?). At least that is what I remember from history classes, because within my lifetime it has always been Labour and Conservative. </p> <p>When I was young, what is now the Liberal Democratic party was a confusing little party with two leaders and no policies that never really did very well. I recall sad pictures in the papers of David Steel looking disappointed.</p> <p>So the change is really quite impressive. As party names Liberal and Conservative seem to make sense to me, because they suggest that they do what they say on the tin, whereas Labour (especially New Labour) as a party name suggests very little.</p> <p>The title of Liberal seems to stand for what our modern society has become: liberal! As Charles Kennedy said in his conference speech, it stands for tolerance and shifting values and, above all, change. </p> <p>Conservative ideals are, by their very nature, unworkable in our society; that things stay the same. Of course that will never be, and with technology improving almost daily, and culture and ideas from all around the globe available at the touch of a button, the concept of the \"conservative\" should theoretically disappear within a generation. </p> <p>But people are still afraid of change, and this is why the Lib Dems are still the third party. However, as Kennedy said, maybe we are entering an era of three party politics. I hope so. Although Billy Connolly once said that the fewer politicians there are the better. </p> <p>I like the ideals of the Lib Dems, I like their rhetoric and I even like their policies. It is, however, easy to like the policies of a party that has no track record in government, for that is when everything changes. I like the ideas of devolution and proportional representation, but once in power are they going to be brave enough to kick away the ladder that got them up there? </p> <p>The notion that budget-wise they have the books balanced is fine in theory; will it work in practice? A united Europe is a noble and important concept, but once committed will we lose control on a local level? The ideas of devolution and European union seem to me to make rather strange bedfellows. Who knows? But what the hell, give them a chance. </p> <p>If anything Charles Kennedy says is to be believed then they do seem the only viable option in our changing, modern world. But then, as likeable as he may appear, we must remember that he is a politician. And this still counts against him in my book.</p>",
  "Jimmy Carter, the former US president, has said Florida lacks \"some basic international requirements for a fair election\" and that a repeat of the 2000 election fiasco \"seems likely\". <p>He said reforms recommended after the recount in Florida had still not been implemented \"because of inadequate funding or political disputes\". </p> <p>Mr Carter, who runs an election and human rights centre in Atlanta, accused election officials working for Florida's governor, Jeb Bush, the president's brother, of being \"highly partisan\". </p> <p>They were \"brazenly violating a basic need for an unbiased and universally trusted authority to manage all elements of the electoral process\". </p> <p>\"The disturbing fact is that a repetition of the problems of 2000 now seems likely, even as many other nations are conducting elections that are internationally certified to be transparent, honest and fair,\" Mr Carter writes in a commentary reprinted in today's Guardian. </p> <p>Busy with the fourth hurricane to hit Florida in six weeks, the governor's office did not return calls seeking comment yesterday. But Mark Foley, a Republican congressman from Florida, rejected Democratic criticism of the state's election preparations. </p> <p>\"They're alleging somehow we're a third-world nation in our ability to handle ballots,\" he told CNN. \"There is no way the supervisors of elections in 67 counties can't handle the proper job of tabulating ballots.\" </p> <p>During the 2000 recount, the Florida state government was accused of trying to orchestrate George Bush's victory by certifying doubtful results and by disenfranchising thousands of mainly black voters with the use of flawed criminal records. </p> <p>Under Florida's laws, former convicts who have completed their sentence remain ineligible to vote for life, unless they receive a specific act of clemency. It is a racially charged issue as 58% of Florida's 600,000 former felons are African-Ameri cans, most convicted of drug offences for which they are more frequently charged than whites. </p> <p>In May, Florida's secretary of state, Glenda Hood (a Bush family partisan), distributed a secret list of 48,000 alleged former felons and instructed county election supervisors to remove them from the voter rolls. When a court ordered the list be published, it was found that more than 20,000 people on the list were black (black Floridians vote Democratic by more than nine to one) and only 61 were Hispanics (who are much more likely to vote Republican). The Miami Herald newspaper found at least 2,000 people should not have been on the list, having regained their voting rights. </p> <p>In his commentary, Mr Carter called the distribution of the list a \"fumbling attempt\" to disenfranchise black people. It was dropped after it became public, but by then 14 counties had sent letters to the residents named, informing them they would be ineligible to vote. </p> <p>It is not easy for the state's former felons to regain the right to vote. According to the Florida Justice Institute, a civil rights organisation, it requires a hearing by the state's clemency board, chaired by Governor Bush, which meets only four times a year and reviews only 50 cases each time. The all-Republican board can turn down requests without giving reasons. </p> <p>Randall Berg, the head of the institute, said the number of former convicts who win back their right to vote each year was \"a drop in the bucket\". </p> <p>Another source of controversy in the 2000 election was the use, in some counties, of punch-card ballot papers which sometimes could not be read by machines because of loose fragments of cardboard (chads) that stuck to them. </p> <p>Mr Carter was a member of a commission that recommended modernising the state's voting equipment, but he says those reforms have been patchy. There are no statewide regulations on keeping a paper record of the vote in the event of another recount.</p>",
  "<p>The Rumours had one of those pleasant moments in life this morning. No, not reading about how ghastly tabloid gargoyles Kerry and Bryan McFadden split up, although that wasn't a bad jolly either.

  "<p>The Wall Street Journal asks some interesting questions about the decision by so many technology bosses to openly back candidates in the upcoming US election.</p> <p>\"Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates, and its CEO, Steve Ballmer, are supporting President Bush for a second term. So are WalMart CEO H Lee Scott Jr, eBay CEO Meg Whitman and Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina.</p> <p>\"On the other side of the political aisle, Warren Buffet, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, and Steve Jobs, CEO of Apple Computer, are economic advisers to Senator John Kerry's campaign and plan to vote for him.\"</p> <p>\"Prior generations of America's business leaders tended to keep their political choices private... but backing a candidate in a divisive election could put CEOs and their companies in a difficult position.\"</p> <p><strong>Comment:</strong> I can't say that knowing Bill Gates plans to vote Bush really helps me warm to either of them, but I'm suspicious of any powerful business leader who openly backs a political party.

  "Since throwing his weight behind the Bush administration after September 11 2001, Pakistan's president, Pervez Musharraf, has successfully portrayed himself as an indispensable ally in the US-led \"war on terror\". <p>The killing by Pakistani security forces of a senior al-Qaida operative, Amjad Hussain Farooqi, is the latest manifestation of that supposed indispensability. Under US pressure and after two assassination attempts last December, General Musharraf has intensified the hunt for terrorists, particularly in provinces bordering Afghanistan. </p> <p>But Pakistan's leader, who came to power in a 1999 coup and legitimised his rule through an unopposed referendum in 2002, remains a problematic partner for the west and a controversial figure at home. </p> <p>His ending of Pakistan's support for the Taliban and his backing for the US invasion of Afghanistan alienated Islamist parties. His decision to negotiate with India on Kashmir, formalised in January's Islamabad declaration, angered the jihadis and raised wider concerns about his intentions. </p> <p>Despite continuing worries domestically and in the west, Gen Musharraf says democracy is flourishing in Pakistan. He points to local elections, the presence of women in government and relatively free speech and media. </p> <p>He suggests most of his opponents are confined to the periphery of Pakistani society. \"The extremists dislike me because I'm operating against them,\" he told the Washington Post at the weekend. \"We are changing the entire psyche of our society, which has been held hostage to extremist ideas. The vast majority are moderate, but they were voiceless. The entire mindset needs to be changed.\" </p> <p>On all these issues, there are other views. Despite an upbeat meeting between Gen Musharraf and the new Indian prime minister, Manmohan Singh, at the UN last week, there are fresh allegations in India that Pakistan is overtly assisting militants in Kashmir. </p> <p>On Afghanistan, some western diplomats in Islamabad suspect elements within Pakistan's military Inter-Services Intelligence are happy to help track down al-Qaida but less keen on suppressing former Taliban proteges. This, it is argued, is because Pakistan, adhering to its long-established doctrine of \"strategic depth\" vis a vis India, wants a biddable regime in its rear in Kabul if western forces leave. </p> <p>The Afghan leader, Hamid Karzai, facing fraught presidential elections next month, has complained that Pakistan is not doing enough to curb resurgent Taliban attacks emanating from Pakistani soil. </p> <p>As with Indian claims about Kashmir, Gen Musharraf rejects the charges. But questions persist about the extent to which he is actually in control. </p> <p>New doubts about his commitment to democracy have been raised, meanwhile, by his suggestion that he may renege on an earlier promise to step down as army leader this year. </p> <p>The Musharraf conundrum is compounded by distorting US priorities. For there can be little doubt, despite denials all round, that Pakistan is under tremendous pressure to catch or kill Osama bin Laden before the US election on November 2. </p> <p>Only America's overriding political imperative explains President George Bush's unquestioning stance in his recent bilateral meeting with Gen Musharraf in New York. Mr Bush did not press Pakistan's leader on democratic reform, on advancing the dialogue with India, or on relations with Mr Karzai. </p> <p>The US president apparently ignored Gen Musharraf's sympathetic attitude to Iran's nuclear activities. He also skirted round the Pakistani leader's refusal to allow the US to interview the head of the secret Pakistani nuclear weapons proliferation network, Abdul Qadeer Khan. </p> <p>Mr Bush left unchallenged Pakistan's refusal to help in Iraq, where neutral Muslim troops are much needed. And he turned a blind eye to Gen Musharraf's sharp criticism of the Iraq war and his implied call for the withdrawal of US and British forces. </p> <p>Instead, according to US officials, Mr Bush made nice, focusing almost exclusively on the fight against al-Qaida and its elusive leader. </p> <p>Between himself and Mr Bush \"there is a total understanding\", said the indispensable Gen Musharraf.</p>",

  "Labour party members in Hartlepool are threatening to deselect their candidate before the general election, even if he wins Thursday's byelection. <p>Unhappiness with the national party's control over the candidate's selection process has prompted some to boycott Iain Wright's campaign. Fewer than half of the town's 25 councillors have actively taken part. </p> <p>Keith Fisher, a former president of the Hartlepool branch, and member for 30 years, said: \"Regardless of how this Thursday's election goes, I predict there will be a new candi date standing here for Labour in the general election.\" </p> <p>When Peter Mandelson announced in July that he would be moving to Brussels, the local party made it clear it did not want him to be replaced with another outsider. </p> <p>Twenty-six nominations, including several town councillors, Mr Mandelson's former election agent and a former local MEP, were submitted, and then vetted by Labour's NEC. The NEC presented the local party with a shortlist, and Iain Wright was the only Hartlepool name on it. </p> <p>\"We were given a choice of one. We felt railroaded into it, and we're seething. Local, long-standing members, not even allowed to stand before their own local party? How can that be? It was shocking - a disgrace,\" Mr Fisher said. \"I can only assume the NEC had an image of what they wanted, someone who'd say yes to everything and wouldn't rock the boat.\" </p> <p>Ray Waller, a councillor for 41 years, said: \"A number of us were surprised there was only one local candidate, and I think once we have got the election over with there will be a discussion, when we make our minds up whether or not to stick with Iain. </p> <p>\"I think it would have given Iain more credibility within the party if other local candidates had been on the shortlist, and that's a view that most party members would share.\" </p> <p>Two-thirds of the local party stayed away from the meeting at which Mr Wright was selected. </p> <p>Robbie Payne, a councillor for the last nine years and cabinet member for four, was one of the nominees rejected by the NEC, and is supporting calls for a new selection process after the election. </p> <p>\"Iain's exactly what New Labour want,\" he said. </p> <p>Anger intensified last month when it became known that Mr Wright's team had offered the local mayor, an independent, a deal for his support. In return for the mayor's endorsement, Labour offered to stand a weak candidate against him at the next mayoral election. The mayor has declined to endorse anyone. </p> <p>Many members are unhappy with the tone of Mr Wright's campaign, which has focused on attacks against the Liberal Democrat candidate's character, and on a promise to \"clear the streets of yobs and thugs\". </p> <p>\"I've worked in every general election since 1955,\" said Mr Waller, \"and it's always been focused on the issues. </p> <p>\"I've delivered leaflets on a couple of occasions this time, and I'm not very happy with the way personality attacks have been the main focus.\" The budget for a byelection is \u00a3100,000, but in the general election the branch will be allowed less than \u00a320,000, and have to rely on local voluntary activists. </p> <p>This support will not be forthcoming, according to Mr Fisher, unless the selection process is allowed to take place again. </p> <p>Iain Wright said the NEC's choice of shortlist was not a matter for him to discuss. \"We are reinvigorating the party. We have 30 new members as a result of this byelection.\"</p>"
