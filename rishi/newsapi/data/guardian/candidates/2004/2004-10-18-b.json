  "They were feted by Robert Mugabe as patriots and pioneers in a radical redistribution of land to redress colonial injustice. But the war veterans who ousted white farmers have now themselves been invaded. <p>Last month, police units fanned across Trelawney, a rural district outside the capital, Harare, and erased settlements with matches and mallets.</p> <p>The devastation starts just north of Harare and stretches for mile after mile with hundreds of homes wrecked, fields scorched and families gone, leaving the landscape silent and empty. \"Now we are in the position the white farmer was. The authorities used us,\" Richard Mapuringa, 33, said last week, sifting through the ruins of his house.</p> <p>Across Trelawney and other districts there were thousands like him, angry and confused over livelihoods reduced to ashes and a promise betrayed.</p> <p>No official explanation was given for the evictions, but the suspicion was that senior figures in the ruling Zanu-PF party wanted to claim the farms, which had names such as Little England, for themselves.</p> <p>\"You can't accept a government that does this,\" said Mr Mapuringa.</p> <p>But it seems Zimbabweans do accept a government that does this and worse.</p> <p>Inflation exceeds 300%, unemployment tops 70%, decent food is unaffordable for many, freedom of speech and assembly have been crushed and a repressive law muzzling civil society is on the way.</p> <p>Parliamentary elections are due next March but instead of fighting for survival, the party that has ruled since independence from Britain in 1980 is expected to coast to victory.</p> <p>Last year's general strike has not been repeated and protest rallies have not materialised. \"Mugabe is more secure in power now than before,\" said one western diplomat, referring to the country's president.</p> <p>A sullen, resigned mood reigns in Zimbabwe. Since narrowly losing elections in 2000 and 2002, which international observers deemed rigged, the opposition Movement for Democratic Change has floundered.</p> <p>Broke, exhausted and traduced by the media, the party has no way of combating the government's ability to pay the forgers and bully opponents. \"We are cracking under the strain,\" said one MP.</p> <p>Non-governmental organisations used to challenge the regime but several have started winding down operations since being targeted by a new bill likely soon to become law. \"People are disillusioned, they can't see a way forward,\" said one United Nations official.</p> <p>What happened at Trelawney shows how the government can keep a tight grip on power despite chaotic policies and deep internal divisions.</p> <p>Having mobilised the settlers in 2000 to chase away the white farmers and their black labourers the government failed to supply feed, training or equipment, prompting a national collapse in production which has fuelled food shortages.</p> <p>\"At least here we still coped. I was able to grow maize, sorghum, ground nuts, paprika, and enough to feed my family,\" said James Hodzi, 58, a local Zanu-PF party chairman.</p> <p>But in mid-September the police destroyed everything.</p> <p>Who gave the order is a mystery, since no minister has publicly endorsed the policy. Earlier this month a high court halted the evictions, prompting Mr Hodzi and others to return and try to rebuild.</p> <p>But as commercial farmers learned four years ago, a court ruling is no protection from the ruling party.</p> <p>Peasants in Trelawney accused Mr Mugabe's sister Sabina and his nephew Joe of coveting their land. Others said it had been earmarked for army officers. Another theory was of a machiavellian plot to discredit a faction within the party. Whatever the motive, invaders were no longer wanted.</p> <p>\"There is some poetic justice in their eviction but you have to sympathise. They have been used. The small fry making way for the bigger fry,\" said John Worsley-Worswick, of the white farmers' group Justice for Agriculture.</p> <p>Not all sympathised. John Jones, one of the last white farmers in Trelawney, welcomed the expulsion of neighbours he accused of theft. \"It's the way forward if we are to get commercial production back on an even keel.\"</p> <p>However, a few miles further down a dirt track his neighbour Mr Hodzi, a self-styled invader, said he was determined to stay and rebuild the burnt shell of his home. A member of Zanu-PF since 1980, he declined at first to blame the party for his troubles but later suggested there was cronyism in the leadership. Gesturing to his scorched fields he said: \"All this destruction, just so someone can give his girlfriend a present.\"</p> <p>Eliciting praise from a white farmer and anger from erstwhile Zanu-PF supporters, the evictions appear an aberration but one that is unlikely to threaten the party's re-election.</p> <p>With a near monopoly of the media and food stocks, and with a population cowed by security forces, the regime feels assured of victory.</p> <p>On a recent trip to Mozambique Mr Mugabe had a spring in his step. \"We are now, day by day, regaining a noteworthy political and economic stability,\" he told journalists. In other words, the possibility of his overthrow had receded.</p>",
  "Dear wonderful, loving friends from abroad, <br> We Ohioans are an ornery sort and don't take meddling well, even if it comes from people we admire and with their sincere goodwill. We are a fairly closed community overall. In my town of Springfield, I feel that there are some that consider people from the nearby cities of Columbus or Dayton, as \"foreigners\"- let alone someone from outside our country. <b>Springfield, Ohio</b> <p>Have you not noticed that Americans don't give two shits what Europeans think of us? Each email someone gets from some arrogant Brit telling us why to NOT vote for George Bush is going to backfire, you stupid, yellow-toothed pansies ... I don't give a rat's ass if our election is going to have an effect on your worthless little life. I really don't. If you want to have a meaningful election in your crappy little island full of shitty food and yellow teeth, then maybe you should try not to sell your sovereignty out to Brussels and Berlin, dipshit. Oh, yeah - and brush your goddamned teeth, you filthy animals. <br><b>Wading River, NY</b> </p> <p>Right on! Just wanted to say thanks from California for your effort and concern. This IS a very important election ... There are so many people here in the States that care about the impact America has on the rest of the world. I am personally saddened for the loss of all innocent lives. The best statement Americans can make to the rest of the world is to not elect Bush for president. Thank you so much for getting involved in our world. <br><b>California</b> </p> <p>Consider this: stay out of American electoral politics. Unless you would like a company of US Navy Seals - Republican to a man - to descend upon the offices of the Guardian, bag the lot of you, and transport you to Guantanamo Bay, where you can share quarters with some lonely Taliban shepherd boys. <br><b>United States</b> </p> <p>I am a student and life-long resident of Clark County, Ohio. I just wanted you to know that this is a wonderful idea you've initiated; people here love and respect the United Kingdom, especially the prime minister. I hope this campaign will be successful for your newspaper and for us voters. <br><b>Springfield, Ohio</b> </p> <p>KEEP YOUR FUCKIN' LIMEY HANDS OFF OUR ELECTION. HEY, SHITHEADS, REMEMBER THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR? REMEMBER THE WAR OF 1812? WE DIDN'T WANT YOU, OR YOUR POLITICS HERE, THAT'S WHY WE KICKED YOUR ASSES OUT. FOR THE 47% OF YOU WHO DON'T WANT PRESIDENT BUSH, I SAY THIS ... TOUGH SHIT! <br><b>PROUD AMERICAN VOTING FOR BUSH!</b> </p> <p>Shame on you for using the people of Ohio like this. The US presidental election isn't just about foreign policy, it's about healthcare, taxes, education, transportation, natural resources and all manner of issues with little to no impact on the people of Britain. </p> <p>We live in a globalised, interconnected world. If China shuts its borders to US imports, you better believe American companies, shareholders and workers are affected. Should US citizens therefore have a direct say in Chinese policies? No - Americans should demand that their own elected leaders address the issues with their Chinese counterparts. The British have a similar voice in US policies - through your own elected representatives who have any number of diplomatic, economic and military tools at their disposal. You vote for your leaders and we'll vote for ours. Your problem is with your leaders, not ours. <br><b>Washington DC</b> </p> <p>Real Americans aren't interested in your pansy-ass, tea-sipping opinions. If you want to save the world, begin with your own worthless corner of it. <br><b>Texas, USA</b> </p> <p>Thank you, thank you, thank you! What a wonderful idea! I am a US citizen who is scared to death that Bush and Klan will get back in. We need all the help we can get to ditch this bunch of maniacs. <br><b>United States</b> </p> <p>I just read a hilarious proposal to involve your readership in the upcoming US presidential election. At least, I'm hoping that it is genius satire. Nothing will do more to undermine the Democratic cause in Ohio than having patronising Brits wander around Clark County telling people how to vote. Just, for a second, imagine if the Washington Post sent folks from Ohio to do the same in Oxfordshire. I'm saying this as a Democrat, and as someone who has spent the last few years in the UK. That is, with all due respect. Please, please, be rational, and move slowly away from the self-defeating hubris. <br><b>United States</b> </p> <p>I enjoy reading your paper and agree with your politics, but this is really too much.Your plan, if carried out, will hurt the Bush opposition TERRIBLY. We cannot afford to have this associated with John Kerry or anyone else. It will be; the press is going in for a kill, days before the election. <br><b>United States</b> </p> <p>Your idea is superb and frankly, we need a little help over here right now. <br><b>Ohio</b> </p> <p>My dear, beloved Brits,<br> I understand the Guardian is sponsoring a service where British citizens write to Americans to advise them on how to vote. Thank heavens! I was adrift in a sea of confusion and you are my beacon of hope! </p> <p>Feel free to respond to this email with your advice. Please keep in mind that I am something of an anglophile, so this is not confrontational. Please remember, too, that I am merely an American. That means I am not very bright. It means I have no culture or sense of history. It also means that I am barely literate, so please don't use big, fancy words. </p> <p>Set me straight, folks!<br><b>Dayton, Ohio</b> </p> <p>Hey England, Scotland and Wales,<br> Mind your own business. We don't need weenie-spined Limeys meddling in our presidental election. If it wasn't for America, you'd all be speaking German. And if America would have had a president, then, of the likes of Kerry, you'd all be goose-stepping around Buckingham Palace. YOU ARE NOT WANTED!! Whether you want to support either party. BUTT OUT!!! <br><b>United States</b> </p> <p>Please be advised that I have forwarded this to the CIA and FBI. <br><b>United States</b> </p> <p>As an American who is very anti-Bush, I applaud your letter-writing campaign. I have read some of the letters that you published, and while I agree with most of the content, I also believe they will not be persuasive. This is because they are too aggressive and, as stated on your website, you don't know anything about these voters. If they happen to be leaning toward Bush, these letters will not put them off. <br><b>New York</b> </p> <p>THE AMERICAN TAXPAYERS HAVE SPENT TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS PROTECTING THE PEOPLES OF THE EU, AND WHAT DO WE GET IN RETURN.

Cheers. <br><b>United States</b> </p> <p>Thank you for taking such an active interest in the elections here in America. I appreciate what the Guardian is doing. Your effort to reach out to \"swing states\" and make a difference is commendable. I hope that many of your readers will take your challenge to help make a change in Washington by contacting voters. <br><b>Clarke County, Georgia</b> </p> <p>Keep your noses out of our business. As I recall we kicked your asses out of our country back in 1776. We do not require input from losers and idiots on who we vote for in our own country. Fuck off and die asshole!!!!! <br><b>Knoxville, Iowa</b> </p> <p>Gentle folks at the Guardian,<br> In your plea to get your non-American readers to write to voters in Clark County, Iowa, you are correct that events in the US have had, and will have, effects on world events. For example, we have pulled your chestnuts out of the fire in two world wars that were occasioned by European diplomacy. Maybe you'd like a vote in which American president will oversee the next rescue. The next time you have elections in Great Britain, I shall endeavour to send names of your citizens to people in France, Iraq, India, the United Arab Emirates, Botswana, Pakistan, China and Argentina so that they may attempt to influence your election. It's only fair that everybody in the world should have a say in the selection of the prime minister. <br><b>California</b> </p> <p>Mind your own flipping business. <br><b>United States</b> </p> <p>Dear Guardian folks,<br> While I empathise with your plight, this attempt to influence voters by sending letters from foreigners will have a negative effect on your ultimate goal. You will cause people to empathise with the president, not the other way around. People will read these letters and say, \"John Le who? Never heard of him, but who is he to tell me who to vote for?\" <br><b>Ohio</b> </p> <p>I am a registered voter in Clark County, Ohio, and am very much interested in hearing what our overseas friends have to say about our election. You are correct in assuming that this election in the US is the most important election in memory. The threat of terrorism is a very real threat, not just in our country, but all over the world. In this day and age there must be worldwide unity against these fanatical groups who just hate. Not just Americans, but all western civilisation. <br><b>United States</b> </p> <p>Thanks for running this initiative. It may be the only way I get to have an impact on the American election, despite the fact that I'm a registered American voter. See, I vote in New York, which is solidly Democratic. Due to the electoral college system, once a majority is secured in any state, subsequent votes don't really matter. Whether NY goes 51% or 99%, the impact on who actually wins is the same. So thanks for the opportunity to impact somebody else's vote, where it may really matter. <br><b>Amsterdam, Holland</b> </p> <p>Who in the hell do you think you are??? Well, I'll tell you, you're a bunch of meddling socialist pricks! Stay the hell out of our country and politics. And another thing, John Kerry is a worthless lying sack of crap so it doesn't surprise me that a socialist rag like yours would back him. I hope your cynical ploy blows up in your cowardly faces, you bunch of mealy-mouthed morons! <br><b>United States</b> </p> <p>I used to visit the UK every year. I love the history and culture of your country. But after I heard about your campaign to influence our elections, I've decided that neither myself, nor my family will ever visit again. I'm offended by your campaign and because of it, I'm remembering more of the negative aspects I've seen in the UK than the positive ones. Though I still love the castles! <br><b>Detroit</b> </p> <p>Dear British friends,<br> I think you have an interesting idea to encourage international grassroots efforts, but I sincerely doubt most Springfielders are going to be influenced by letters from a country they probably can't even point to on a map. I wish you luck with your campaign, but I warn you that you're not likely to accomplish much. <br><b>Dayton, Ohio</b> </p> <p>You radical leftwingers are worse than the Taliban. I suggest you stand back and take a good hard look at yourselves. </p> <p>PS: When do you propose to add Michael Moore to your staff of lunatics? <br><b>United States</b> </p> <p>I suggest that if a particular reader of the Guardian would like to vote in America - would really like to influence the American election, say - that reader should move to America, become a citizen of the United States. Everyone is welcome here. Even the readers of the Guardian. But if you don't wish to be an American, to live in Ohio, for instance, and participate in the American political process, that is too bad. Perhaps there is something wrong with you. Perhaps it is your teeth.<br><b>New York</b> </p> <p>Go back to sipping your tea and leave our people alone. <br><b>Ohio</b> </p> <p>As an American who is afraid of the terrible ramifications if Bush is elected, I commend your efforts to try to get Britons involved. Although many Americans would be critical of British people \"meddling\" with our politics and elections, all the world will share in the disaster if Bush is re-elected. Many of us are very concerned. I teach young adults, most of whom have been very uninvolved in voting and politics. Many of them are going to vote. We need all the help we can get. <br><b>United States</b> </p> <p>As a US citizen, I want to advise you that you and anyone that participates in subverting the US presidential election can be criminally charged and perhaps even charged as spies. <br><b>California</b> </p> <p>Thank God above for you English! Just when I was beginning to despair at the thought of Bush being re-elected, you come along with a strategy to help us!

  "Most people in Kareza, a dusty village two hours north of Kabul, keep animals tethered outside their mud-walled houses. Commander Mafouz keeps two Soviet tanks. The 21-year-old fighter has grown fond of the two green hulks, which still have live shells in their barrels; so fond that he recently threatened to kill the UN team that tried to tow them away. <p>\"My brother died after capturing these tanks from the Taliban. My father died fighting the Soviets,\" he said yesterday, standing defiantly before the T-55 and T-62 nestled under a line of berry trees before his front door. \"I'm not going to give them up just like that.\" </p> <p>Afghanistan's remarkably peaceful election, in which vote counting is continuing, spelled \"the end of the rule of the gun\", declared the US commander Lt-Gen David Barno last week. </p> <p>His prediction may be a little premature. The Taliban threat may have subsided but, after a quarter-century of Soviet, American and Pakistani-fuelled wars, Afghanistan is awash with an exotic array of weaponry. Just how much, nobody knows, but estimates run from 1m to 3m weapons. </p> <p>\"You could start world war three with the amount of ammunition in some places,\" said Peter Babbington, a retired Royal Marine heading the UN-led demobilisation, disarmament and reintegration (DDR) programme. </p> <p>The 16-month DDR drive has made slow progress. Officials have impounded 70% of heavy weapons - which include tanks, rockets, bombs and terrorist-favoured shoulder-to-air missiles. But only about 21,000 of the estimated 60,000 militia fighters have retired their battered AK-47s. </p> <p>Afghanistan's many warlords, who are agnostics in the campaign to convert them to democracy, are mostly at fault. Efforts by Hamid Karzai's interim government to lure the renamed \"regional leaders\" into politics have only partly succeeded. The Uzbek hardman Rashid Dostum, who is accused of war crimes, contested this presidential election. But many others have remained quietly on the sidelines, some running growing drug empires from the bumper opium crop. </p> <p>The demobilisation officers also have to convince their footsoldiers to give up the gun, no easy feat when an entire generation has known only war. The option of joining the fledgling Afghan national army, with its $70 (\u00a339) monthly salary, seems unattractive to some. </p> <p>As Commander Mafouz stood guard by his tanks, about 200 of his comrades were trudging into the local barracks to demobilise, surrendering battered rifles and old artillery pieces to UN officials. </p> <p>The 21-year-old fighter, who has eight years' military experience but no school ing, might join them, he hinted with a coy smile - but only if the UN offered him a new Toyota 4x4 and a briefcase of cash. </p> <p>A wider problem may be changing attitudes. A long history of bloodshed has embedded a gun culture in many rural areas. Today there is a light police presence, a farcical judicial system, and every Afghan man retains the right to carry his own weapon. Most still do. </p> <p>\"In this country your home insurance policy is an AK-47 over the fireplace,\" said Mr Babbington. \"And if it was taken from Russians, there's no getting it back.\" </p> <p>Memories of Afghanistan's many flip-flops between war and peace have caused some to hide their weapons, no matter how big. </p> <p>In Jalalabad, DDR officials dug five Soviet tanks out of field. In Badakhshan, a community so revered a tank that they built a house around it. But nowhere is the gun culture stronger than in the Panjshir Valley. </p> <p>The 55-mile mountainous corridor was home to the legendary warlord and Afghan hero Ahmed Shah Massoud, who was assassinated by al-Qaida suicide bombers in 2001. </p> <p>It is also, as the locals like to remind visitors, one of the few places never touched by the Taliban. But it has proved equally impregnable to the UN teams, who say it is one of the last areas to resist significant demobilisation. </p> <p>Tanks and anti-aircraft gunbarrels jut from some of the highest peaks in Panjshir. Dozens more line the rocky track that twists along a gushing river on the valley bed. Yet local commanders have forbidden DDR officials from removing even one mortar launcher. </p> <p>\"Go away,\" said an angry soldier as this reporter drove up to a line of tanks parked by the road last Saturday. \"No foreigners are allowed here.\" </p> <p>\"We are taking care of security and the weapons are safe here,\" said Khalil Rahman, an official at the governor's office. \"We don't think it's necessary to send them all to Kabul.\" </p> <p>Politics and pride lie behind the refusenik attitude. Panjshiri resistance was at the heart of the Northern Alliance that overthrew the Taliban; now many feel that their valour has not been recognised. </p> <p>\"During the resistance we saved people's lives; now they say we are just gunmen,\" said Noornudin, a one-time Massoud bodyguard who now stands guard over his commander's grave at a hilltop shrine in the valley. </p> <p>Others feel marginalised by the US-backed government of the ethnic Pashtun Hamid Karzai, who is the frontrunner in this election. </p> <p>Gul Mohammed, a retired mujahid general, curled his hand into a fist and likened it to a map of Afghanistan: \"We are at the heart of the country,\" he said, pointing to his thumb. \"Not like the Pashtuns, who are on the borders.\" </p> <p>The pace of future demobilisation hinges on the election results, the final tally of which is not due for another two weeks. </p> <p>Until now, President Karzai has used a policy of appeasement against the warlords and their troops, trying to nudge them into civilian life. If, as expected, he remains president, he will come under pressure to take more of a hardline approach. </p> <p>Accelerating demobilisation will be critical to success - particularly in the run-up to parliamentary elections scheduled for April. Vikram Parekh, a Kabul-based analyst with the International Crisis Group, says: \"It is crucial to ensuring these elections are fairly contested.\"</p>",
  "<b> Sunday Mirror </b> Editorial, Zimbabwe, October 17 <br> <p>\"The judgment [in] the treason trial of Morgan Tsvangirai, the leader of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) will go a long way in remoulding the way in which both the local and international communities regard matters of governance in Zimbabwe. Against many's expectations, and despite much vitriolic media hype, Mr Tsvangirai was acquitted on Friday. How the case was handled symbolises that there is the rule of law in Zimbabwe. </p> <p>\"There are checks and balances and therefore there was no need for fear that the executive, or the ruling Zanu-PF for that matter, would interfere with the justice delivery system.\" </p> <p><b> Standard</b> Editorial, Zimbabwe, October 17 <br> </p> <p>\"It was abundantly clear that international fraudster and fortune-hunter Ari Ben Menashe had framed the rather naive Mr Tsvangirai and the charges were trumped-up and politically motivated. Mr Tsvangirai's victory this first round is as charged with sorrow and doubt as it is with joy and gratitude. A second treason charge is hanging over his head and democratic forces everywhere cannot sleep easily. The battle is not over yet. Zimbabweans are in for a long haul.\" </p> <p><b> Daily News</b> Editorial, Zimbabwe, October 16 <br> </p> <p>\"Most analysts called this a political trial, part of Zanu-PF's sinister plot to enfeeble the most formidable opposition political party since independence. The judgment suggests strongly that justice is still alive and well in Zimbabwe, that in spite of attempts by Zanu-PF there are still men and women of conscience who will act in accordance with the law, and not out of warped party loyalty.\" </p> <p><b> Sunday Mail</b> Editorial, Zimbabwe, October 17 <br> </p> <p>\"The fact that people can sit down and discuss the elimination of a sitting president smacks of conspiracy and to argue that Mr Tsvangirai should not have been on trial is being mischievous. Mr Tsvangirai had himself said it was not him who was on trial but democracy. So if democracy was under trial has it now been acquitted?\" </p> <p><b> Nathaniel Manheru</b> Herald, Zimbabwe, October 16 <br> </p> <p>\"Mr Tsvangirai is a man the courts have saved from the gallows, only to be delivered to the guillotine of popular vote, come March 2005.\" </p> <p>\"Skilfully, Zanu-PF has already dubbed the March 2005 election the anti-Blair election, in the process keeping MDC's troubled linkage with the west under a spotlight. The vast western media availed to Mr Tsvangirai soon after his acquittal; the loud sigh of relief that rang loud in the hallways of No 10, the White House and other corridors of the west, only serves to reinforce Zanu-PF's campaign, while firmly nailing the MDC mast high on the pole of empire where it flutters to an ill political wind.\" </p> <p><b> Daily Telegraph </b> Editorial, October 16 <br> </p> <p>\"The prospects for the opposition are of continued brutal harassment by an old tyrant, who appears to have concluded that it would be self-defeating to imprison or execute Mr Tsvangirai. Robert Mugabe would thereby make a martyr of a man who no longer poses any immediate threat to his rule. </p> <p>\"In the meantime, the economy continues to unravel. Zimbabweans go hungry while their president makes absurdly optimistic claims about the size of the grain harvest. This is a country going steadily downhill. The acquittal of Mr Tsvangirai, though cheering in itself, will not halt that melancholy slide.\"</p>",
  "There is an elderly woman with a long-winded anecdote about the old days on the prairies; a farmer with a desperate appeal for drought assistance and lower petrol prices; and a set of African refugees who want a group photograph of themselves. <p>Tom Daschle, the most powerful Democrat in Washington, has time for them all. </p> <p>The party's Senate leader stays long after a Sioux Falls community dinner was due to finish, until the last question is answered, and the last anxious words are heard. The tables have all been dismantled and the chairs neatly stacked. </p> <p>For the first time since he entered the Senate in 1986, Mr Daschle is fighting for his political survival. But there is much more than his career in play. Control of the Senate is also at stake, and all that that means - a legislative veto, the right to ratify foreign treaties and the power to shape the supreme court. </p> <p>The Republicans have a two-vote majority in the Senate. The Democrats have an outside chance of overturning that margin, but virtually no chance if their Senate leader loses this excruciatingly tight race to a popular and photogenic Republican, John Thune. \"This is a very pivotal election,\" Mr Daschle said in an interview after the last potential voter had drifted out into the cool, prairie night. \"We can't win back the Senate without winning this race, and the president himself has said this is the second-most important race in the country. It's become the most expensive race per capita in American political history.\" </p> <p>If George Bush is re-elected, Mr Daschle will continue to be the Democrats' last line of defence against the president's second-term agenda. If John Kerry wins the presidency, on the other hand, the senator from South Dakota will be his right-hand man in Congress. </p> <p>Either way, it will make an enormous difference if Mr Daschle is leader of the minority, as is the case now, or of the majority - in which case he will have a decisive say in the Senate's order of business, and his office will become a power centre to rival the White House. \"We are involved on a regular basis, we confirm all ambassadors and ratify all treaties, so it has a huge importance,\" Mr Daschle said. \"The next president and the next Senate are likely to confirm two or three new supreme court justices. There is little doubt that the direction the supreme court takes over the next 20 or 30 years will be determined at this election.\" </p> <p>In America's ongoing culture wars, control of the supreme court is even more important than residency of the White House. The court alone will determine whether the US is a country where abortion is legal, whether restrictions on stem cell research are legalised, whether there are gay marriages, and whether the death penalty is maintained, restricted or banned. </p> <p>Both parties have poured millions into the sparsely populated state, where there are barely 400,000 voters and where the politics are decidedly retail. The big issues are drought, the future of the corn-based fuel, ethanol, guns, and the plight of the Indian reservations, and of a pesky rodent, the prairie dog. </p> <p>The airwaves are choked with campaign advertisements but in a race that will be probably be decided by a few hundred votes either way, both Mr Daschle and Mr Thune know the only real way to clinch a floating vote is to meet every possible voter in person. </p> <p>Hence Mr Daschle's long night at the Sioux Falls com munity centre, and Mr Thune's insistence on as many debates as possible. His campaign asked for 25. The Daschle camp finally agreed to six. </p> <p>The encounters are a far cry from the much-hyped presidential debates, after which a 100 smooth-talking surrogates flood a packed media hall with spin. At a recent Daschle-Thune debate in the small university town of Vermillion, there were two journalists in attendance and Mr Thune did all the post-debate spin himself. He agreed with his opponent that the election was particularly critical in view of the Senate's role in approving new supreme court justices. </p> <p>Mr Thune stops short of saying that a new court should overturn the landmark \"Roe v Wade\" decision that legalised abortion in 1973, saying only: \"The president is not going to have a litmus test, but I do think it means that he will be able to appoint justices who will interpret the constitution.\" </p> <p>As ever in the heated culture wars, the remarks are coded to send an encouraging signal to conservatives, but remain outwardly vague for others. </p> <p>Mr Thune has a lot going for him electorally, as well as the $2m or more that the national Republican party has devoted to winning Mr Daschle's scalp. The former congressman has a vote-winning combination of distinguished grey hair and strong-jawed film star looks - a midwestern version of Robert Kilroy-Silk. He is also a nimble and aggressive debater, arguably stronger than the softly-spoken senator. </p> <p>Again and again at the Vermillion debate, Mr Thune accused his opponent of being \"the chief obstructionist\" in Washington, blocking legislation for the sake of political advantage. He echoed the Wall Street Journal's judgment that the Senate had become the \"Daschle Dead Zone\" for new laws. Each slogan landed with the force of a punch and won cheers from a largely conservative crowd of South Dakotan students. </p> <p>In a mostly conservative state, where 58% of voters are registered Republicans, Mr Thune is playing to a home audience. </p> <p>Mr Daschle's Senate tenure, by contrast, has always been something of an anomaly. He has held on to his seat by cultivating his constituents, making sure he visited every county in the state each term in a 1971 Pontiac, until the old car fell apart. </p> <p>He has also campaigned to the right of the Democratic mainstream. This time, for example, one of his advertisements shows him hugging President Bush a few days after the September 11 attacks. It is not an image that goes down well with hardcore supporters but it helps counter allegations that he is no more than a partisan obstructionist. </p> <p>The senator has also burned some of his bridges with environmentalists by turning against the cuddly prairie dog, blamed by ranchers for eating their pastures. Mr Daschle now backs poisoning them in large numbers. </p> <p>Most of all, Mr Daschle is campaigning on the clout of his office as a Senate leader. It means, he repeatedly points out, this is a moment in history when one of the most important desks in the country is controlled by South Dakota. </p> <p>The Daschle camp is hoping that this pragmatic appeal will be enough to win over at least one in five of the state's registered Republicans, just enough to outweigh Mr Thune's party advantage, and that the margin of victory will be secured by mobilising the state's 40,000 long-suffering Sioux Indians, who are just waking up to their own political leverage. If the election is as tight as it promises to be, they could well determine who controls the US Senate.</p>",
  "There is nothing George Bush likes more than extolling the virtues of democracy in faraway places. On October 8, during the second presidential debate, he promised: \"Freedom is on the march. Tomorrow, Afghanistan will be voting for a president.\" Apparently some Afghans enjoyed their new freedoms so much, they voted for the US surrogate, Hamid Karzai, several times over, after the ink used to mark voters' thumbs wore off. By the middle of the day, all 15 of Karzai's challengers had withdrawn. Freedom was not even limping let alone marching. <p>\"Today's election is not a legitimate election,\" said Abdul Satar Sirat, after he and the other disgruntled candidates had met in his house. Bush's national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, knew better. \"This election is going to be judged legitimate,\" she said. \"I'm just certain of it.\" When it comes to fixing elections, the Bush administration has a way of making the lame walk. </p> <p>By Monday an exit poll funded by the US government and conducted by the International Republican Institute, which has links to the Republican party, revealed Karzai as a comfortable winner. After diplomatic arm-twisting by the US ambassador, the 15 challengers withdrew their withdrawals. It was a miracle. A few days later, in the final presidential debate, Bush would literally claim divine intervention. \"In Afghanistan, I believe that the freedom there is a gift from the Almighty.\" </p> <p>Back in the US, however, the Almighty seems far less generous. Bush's enthusiasm to export democracy is not matched by his desire to defend it at home. With just a fortnight to go to the presidential election, efforts to obstruct and deny the vote, particularly to black and Latino voters, are intensifying. Forty years after the civil rights act enshrined the franchise in the constitution for African-Americans, freedom is being crippled. </p> <p>The group most likely to serve in Iraq and Afghanistan, where they are ostensibly extending democracy and freedom - African-Americans - is most likely to be denied those rights in the US. There is nothing new in this contradiction. In the cold war, when the US lectured the eastern bloc on the delights of democracy, black Americans couldn't vote. </p> <p>The issue of disenfranchisement does not affect only minorities. The use of electronic voting in many states, using machines that leave no paper trail, has sent confidence that a fair election is likely, or even possible, into freefall. Once dismissed as the obsession of conspiracy theorists, fear of fraud is now mainstream. \"Will your vote be counted?\" asks the cover of Newsweek. \"Election protests already started: Fraud intimidation alleged in key states,\" says a USA Today front page. </p> <p>The former employee of a company hired by the Republican party to register voters in Nevada says he was told to throw Democrats' registration forms away. And last January, the Republican Ellyn Bogdanoff won a seat in Florida's senate by just 12 votes, out of almost 11,000 cast. According to state law there should have been an automatic recount; moreover, 137 votes emerged blank. But because the voting had been done by machine there was nothing to recount. Bogdanoff took the seat. The machines will be used on November 2. </p> <p>Sometimes these efforts bear the official imprimatur of local officials. Given the debacle in Florida four years ago, you would think the governor (Bush's brother Jeb) would be anxious to ensure that anyone who wants to vote can. Instead he has introduced a rule that registration forms should be rejected if a citizenship check box is not complete - even when people have signed an oath on the same form declaring themselves to be US citizens. Meanwhile Ohio's Republican secretary of state, Kenneth Blackwell, attempted to enforce a rule by which only registration cards printed on heavy, 80lb paper stock would be accepted, claiming lighter cards might be shredded by postal equipment (meaning that voters who have to re-register on the heavier paper might not make it on time). And last summer the chief executive of Diebold, which makes many of the voting machines, said he was \"committed to helping Ohio deliver its electoral votes\" to Bush. </p> <p>African-Americans, however, remain the principal target of the Republican campaign to block the vote. Unlike the 60s, when black Americans were barred from the polls by police dogs, water cannon and billy clubs, the means today are more refined. Occasionally the mask slips. In July, John Pappageorge, Michigan's Republican state legislator, told a Republican meeting: \"If we do not suppress the Detroit vote, we're going to have a tough time in this election cycle.\" Detroit is more than 80% black. It does not take a genius to work out whose votes he was keen to suppress. </p> <p>So far it has mainly been a mix of petty harassment and bureaucratic pedantry, devised to intimidate newly registered and poor voters, a huge proportion of whom are black and Latino. Take Florida. According to the Washington Post, African-Americans in Republican-run Duval county were the most likely to have their voter registration forms rejected, while rejections for Democrats outnumbered Republicans by three to one. In 2000, 42% of ballots rejected by the Duval county election board came from mainly black areas. </p> <p>In Ohio, Mr Blackwell also told election boards that anyone who turned up at the wrong polling station would not be able to cast a provisional ballot (to be verified later). The Democrats successfully sued, saying that the ruling would disadvantage minority and poor voters, who tend to move more often. </p> <p>It is not difficult to fathom what is driving these efforts, which are being replicated throughout the country. The best indication of how an American will vote is race. More than 80% of African-Americans voted Democrat in the last election. Incapable of persuading them to vote Republican, Republicans now seek to prevent them voting Democrat. </p> <p>This task has become particularly urgent because voter registration recently ended in many states, revealing that voter rolls in black and Latino areas have swollen in far greater numbers than in Republican precincts. Between the last election and August this year, almost 200,000 additional black voters were registered in Florida. </p> <p>So while these attempts are clearly racial in nature, they are essentially partisan in motivation. With apologies to Malcolm X, they are about winning by any means necessary. Republicans support democracy when democracy supports Republicans. But they are equally happy to do without it when it is inconvenient. That was always true abroad, from Venezuela to Nicaragua and Pakistan to Saudi Arabia. Now it is true at home, from Detroit to Duval County. </p> <p>Freedom is on the retreat. And the man who assumed office four years ago thanks to thousands of disenfranchised black voters is again leading the charge. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:g.younge@theguardian.com\">g.younge@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "The pressure on Tony Blair to support George Bush in his re-election campaign through the redeployment of UK forces as a proxy US reserve is more acute than may appear at first (British troops face role in Baghdad, October 16). There are questions that both the US presidential candidates are avoiding. How long can the US keep 138,000 troops or more in Iraq? What if full-scale civil war erupts there? Without British help would the next US president be faced with a choice of pulling out of Iraq rather than instituting a draft? <p>According to the Pentagon's own assessment, there are \"inadequate total numbers of troops to meet US security interests in Iraq\". General John Keane, who retired last year as the US army's no 2, says the continued success of the all-volunteer military is not guaranteed. </p> <p>Mr Blair and his government must again decide if they will prop up a president who is unpopular in the world by providing a proxy reserve for US forces to avoid the issue of a draft becoming a hot political potato in the final run into the US elections.<br><b>Mark Stephens</b><br> Finers Stephens Innocent </p> <p>Part of the answer to Peter Martindale's questions (Letters, October 16) can be answered by reading Hansard for March 18 2003, which reveals a wider debate to the more truncated one in the media. </p> <p>Almost all the arguments of the MPs in favour of military action focused on three issues: Saddam Hussein's non- compliance with the 1991 UN ceasefire and subsequent 17 resolutions; the nature of the regime and impossibility of getting change from within; the need to deal with the threat Saddam posed to a number of the countries in that unstable area; and to try and create a situation where stability could develop and allow a chance of resolving the Palestine-Israel question. </p> <p>WMD ran through these arguments, but was not as central as it is now. Tony Blair initially focused on all these issues, but increasingly and, in my view, mistakenly focused more on WMD. The media also focused on that, and it became the new agenda but it didn't change the reason most of us voted as we did.<br><b>Clive Soley MP</b><br>Lab, Ealing and Acton</p>",
  "<p>With just over a fortnight to go, the polling gets serious. Where there would once have been one a day, we can now expect several. In theory that should allow for a more informed prediction of the final result, but having two or more polls is like having two watches \u2013 you can never be sure which is telling the right time.</p> <p>The latest polls have presented such a scenario. The <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/content/?ci=13657\">Gallup</a> poll for <strong>CNN-USA Today</strong> has George Bush 8% ahead (a clear lead) but the <strong>Reuters-Zogby</strong> <a href=\"http://www.zogby.com/news/ReadNews.dbm?ID=895\">daily tracker</a> ties the president and his challenger on 45%. The complication here is that Mr Bush has lost a 48% lead in the latter poll since Friday to John Kerry and a growing number of undecideds, but he pulled back from being 1% behind last week in the former.</p> <p>So, what is going on?</p> <p>First of all, some people have a few problems with Gallup. <strong>Salon</strong> <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/politics/war_room/index.html\">points out</a> that the pollster gave Mr Bush a 13% lead over Al Gore at this stage in 2000 (who went on to win more votes) and weights its sample on the assumption that more Republicans vote than Democrats. It adds that this is the opposite of what happens in what it likes to call the \"reality-based world\".</p> <p>Second is that the headline figures may be meaningless. John Zogby argues that the least useful question a pollster can ask is <a href=\"http://straitstimes.asia1.com.sg/news/story/0,4386,278580,00.html\">who a voter will vote for</a>, and came closest to predicting 2000 by asking his sample to imagine they were in the Wizard of Oz and had to choose between a brainy but heartless tin man (Mr Gore) and an all-heart but no brains scarecrow (Mr Bush). The two characters were tied. He tips to the tin man this time around.</p> <p>If you follow the thinking that it is the underlying indicators that count the most, you begin to start looking at the importance voters attach to each issue - if they vote on economics or the war on terror - and the candidates' approval ratings. The University of Virginia's <strong>Crystal Ball</strong> argues that Mr Bush's approval rating (<a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/election2004/article/0,18471,725047,00.html\">49% in a Time poll</a>) needs to be at <a href=\"http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/article.php?id=LJS2004101201\">51% or above</a> if the undecideds are not going to break at the last minute for Mr Kerry. Then there comes the question of how the large numbers of newly registered voters will align themselves, or if the pollsters are ignoring them.</p> <p>But polls, even the best, can only tell you so much. The key thing about the US presidential election is that it is not decided on the national figures, no matter how extensive and well-weighted the sample: if it was, Mr Gore would now be standing for re-election. It is decided state by state. The Gallup poll excepted, most are pointing to a close finish. If your two watches were only seconds apart, would you know which one to take off?</p>",
  "Britain will decide within days whether to grant a US request for troops to cover for the American army in Iraq, the defence secretary Geoff Hoon announced today, although he insisted that the US request was purely military and not political. <p>To a clearly anxious House of Commons, Mr Hoon confirmed that a request for assistance had been received on October 10 and that the chief of defence staff would reach a decision by the middle of the week.</p> <p>But he repeated that the demand for UK troops to fill in for Americans south of Baghdad, while US troops undertook operations against \"terrorists\" elsewhere in the country, was purely an operational decision.</p> <p>Mr Hoon received the full and unqualified support of only one MP for his statement - the Tory backbencher Quentin Davies - while others questioned him closely as to the government's exit strategy, time limit, chain of command, terms of engagement, the rules of the international criminal court and which particular UK troops would be deployed.</p> <p>The defence secretary said there was a \"strong operational justification\" for the request, and, if granted, it would be \"one ally strongly supporting another\".</p> <p>A forward reconnaissance team would examine the area of deployment tomorrow, he revealed.</p> <p>Mr Hoon refused to debate \"precise details\" of the terms of the international criminal court if UK troops killed Iraqi civilians, but said, in reference to the previous restraint shown by UK peacekeepers in the south of the country: \"This will be less restrained if there is a direct threat to them.\"</p> <p>In a sombre hour-long presentation to MPs, Mr Hoon was repeatedly quizzed as to whether the decision had already, in effect, been taken - an accusation which he rejected, although when asked he did not name any other occasions when US requests had been turned down.</p> <p>Mr Hoon told MPs the British troops would not be required to serve in Baghdad or Falluja. He added: \"There has been considerable speculation in the media over the past several days about the United Kingdom deploying forces outside its current area of operations in southern Iraq. </p> <p> He went on: \"Iraqi security forces and coalition forces have recently been involved in intensified operations to restore areas under the control of militants and terrorists to the authority of the Iraqi interim government. Recent operations in Najaf, in Samarra, and in North Babil have been undertaken as part of this effort. </p> <p>\"The political process is moving ahead as a result of these actions. This strategy is designed to increase pressure on, and deal with, those terrorists who are trying to prevent the rebuilding of Iraq, and who threaten the holding of free elections in January. </p> <p>\"The US request is for a limited number of UK ground forces to be made available to relieve US forces to allow them in turn to participate in further operations elsewhere in Iraq to maintain the continuing pressure on terrorists. </p> <p>\"The request does not ask for British troops to be deployed to Baghdad city, nor to Falluja.\" </p> <p>Mr Hoon refused specifically to confirm that the UK troops involved would come from the Black Watch regiment, currently serving as the reserve in the UK area of operations. </p> <p>But he responded several times to MPs' questions asking if the regiment would have to stay beyond its routine six-month tour of duty, scheduled to finish by the end of the year. </p> <p>He said the Black Watch were \"determined to carry through this operation, should it be decided they participate\". </p> <p>The shadow defence secretary, Nicholas Soames, and the ex-Tory leader, Iain Duncan Smith, asked whether British troops operating under American rules of engagement could be subject to prosecution under international criminal court rules. </p> <p>Mr Hoon refused to discuss details of the troops' rules of engagement but said ICC action would only ever be taken where the soldiers' own country would not take action. </p> <p>\"We would take action,\" the defence secretary said.</p> <p>Mr Hoon came in for particular criticism from the phalanx of anti-war MPs on the Labour backbenches, with veteran leftwing MP Dennis Skinner saying that - by definition - \"If it's done before November 2, its political. It's handing President Bush a lifeline.\"</p> <p>Former shadow foreign secretary Gerald Kaufman received the largest cheers for complaining that there was a risk that \"UK forces risking their lives will be exploited in a US election\".</p>",
  "The Palestinian foreign minister, Nabil Shaath, today called on Britain to fill the gap in the Middle East peace process left as the US focuses on next month's presidential election. <p>Speaking after talks in London with the foreign secretary, Jack Straw, Mr Shaath said Palestinians were paying the price of the US being distracted in the run-up to the November 2 election and possibly for months afterwards. </p> <p>He said the hiatus could continue until January 2005, when either the incumbent president, George Bush, or his Democratic challenger, John Kerry, is sworn in. </p> <p>\"I do not think the three coming months should just witness Palestinians getting killed. I think something can be done by America's friends and allies, and I think Britain is very well situated to do that,\" he said. </p> <p>His plea came as Human Rights Watch released a report condemning the bulldozing of Palestinian homes by the Israeli army. </p> <p>Israel has said the action was necessary to stem Palestinian attacks on Israeli border towns, but the human rights watchdog said it had gone beyond what could be justified on security grounds. </p> <p>It highlighted the situation in the southern Gaza town of Rafah, where more than 10% of the population have lost their homes.</p> <p>The US was one of the key quartet sponsors - along with the EU, the UN and Russia - of the road map peace plan, which stalled shortly after being launched in June last year. </p> <p>Neither Israel nor the Palestinians have implemented the plan, which calls for an end to violence, the reform of Palestinian institutions and a freeze on construction in Jewish settlements. </p> <p>\"I think the road map provides the answer, and a simultaneously observed ceasefire is the way to start it,\" Mr Shaath added. </p> <p>\"We would like very much to see the United Kingdom, with its important relationships across the Atlantic, its permanent status in the security council and its influence in the quartet, to really help us pursue that road by getting us back to peace,\" he said. </p> <p>The prime minister, Tony Blair, has promised to make revitalising the process a personal priority following the US election, and Mr Straw today acknowledged that attention in Washington was being diverted away from the road map. \"Whenever there is an election campaign anywhere in the world, the candidates are preoccupied with winning the election and other things get put on the back burner ... but, meanwhile, we are pressing ahead as far and as fast as we can,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Straw said Britain condemned all acts of terrorism, and reiterated his concerns about rocket attacks on Israelis from Gaza. However, he said Britain believed Israel's military response to the attacks had been \"disproportionate.\" </p> <p>Meanwhile, the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, again said he would push ahead with a planned withdrawal from the Gaza Strip and parts of the West Bank, despite criticism from Jewish settlers. Mr Sharon spoke a day after holding a tense meeting with settler leaders. He has pledged to put his \"disengagement plan\" to a parliamentary vote on October 25 and, despite a rift in his hardline Likud party, is expected to prevail with the backing of dovish opposition parties. </p> <p>He today told reporters that he was required to bring his plan to parliament and intended to follow it through, despite pressure from the settlers.</p> <p>\"The responsibility of managing the issues of the country, the responsibility of the future of the country, is not the concern of just one group. It is the concern of the entire nation, and this burden is placed on my shoulders, and this is how I plan to behave,\" he said. </p> <p>Settler leaders yesterday described the meeting with their former ally as \"disgraceful\", and pressed for a national referendum. However, Mr Sharon again rejected the idea. Current polls show that around two-thirds of Israelis supported the pullout despite large, well-funded and publicised protests by the settlers and their supporters. Mr Sharon has already lost two separate votes within Likud on his plan.</p>",
  "Downing Street today insisted that any decision about UK troop numbers in Iraq would be \"about preparing for the Iraqi election, not the US election\". <p>The defence secretary Geoff Hoon will this afternoon spell out to MPs the current situation in a statement on Iraq at 3.30pm. He is expected to confirm that a request has been made for extra UK troops by the US, and that this is an operational matter still under consideration.</p> <p>Yesterday saw up to 100,000 people march to protest against the war in Iraq and demand British troops were withdrawn, but today No 10 was defiant, saying a decision would be taken on what was \"operationally necessary\".</p> <p>Speaking at the morning lobby session, Tony Blair's spokesman insisted: \"If this is about any elections it's about preparing for the Iraqi elections, not the US election.\" </p> <p>\"Let's not jump too far ahead. I think it's important to recognise the context. </p> <p>\"This is a proposal which has come from the operational level, not the political level. It therefore has to be decided within the Ministry of Defence in terms of operationally, from the ground up and that's very much the emphasis. </p> <p>\"We will wait for firm proposals before ministers and the prime minister will make any decision. That's where we are at.\" </p> <p>The spokesman stressed that UK forces already worked with the Americans in different areas in Iraq, and with other forces within the multinational force. </p> <p>He went on: \"If there are proposals coming forward, those proposals will be based on an assessment on the ground and what's operationally necessary and operationally possible.\" </p> <p>Saying he wanted to \"deal head-on\" with claims that any decision to deploy the UK forces in a different area was linked to the US elections, the spokesman stressed: \"The multinational force's job is to help restore stability in Iraq, deal with the insurgency terrorism, help the process of Iraqi-isation and so help prepare both for the Iraqi elections and the day that a democratic Iraqi government can take responsibility for itself.\" </p> <p>The spokesman added: \"Of course, there's a political dimension because ministers in the end will be part of the decision-making process, but it's based on operational assessments on the ground. You do have to let that process be completed before you get involved in any political dimension.\"</p> <p>Downing Street today again insisted no decision had yet been taken to switch British troops to another operating area in Iraq - and again denied any decision would be influenced by the forthcoming US presidential election. </p> <p> This afternoon MPs will have the chance to question Mr Hoon on reports that the US wants a British battalion to \"back fill\" for its forces around Baghdad to free up American firepower for an expected assault on Falluja. </p> <p>Mr Hoon is expected to confirm that a formal request for assistance has been received from Washington when he delivers a statement to the House of Commons. </p> <p>But MoD officials indicated that it would be a \"holding statement\" with no announcement of changes. </p> <p>Government ministers today dismissed Conservative allegations that they were planning to send troops as a \"political gesture\" to the White House ahead of next month's US presidential elections. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy, warned against any redeployment, saying that it risked becoming an \"ensnarement strategy\" which would make British withdrawal from Iraq even more difficult. </p> <p>Mr Kennedy said the UK should be planning its withdrawal from Iraq, not becoming more involved in the occupation. </p> <p>\"This, far from being an exit strategy, runs the risk of being an ensnarement strategy that drags Britain further into the mire,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. </p> <p>It was difficult to see why the US considered redeployment of the British unit - just 0.5% of all coalition troops in Iraq - so vital, said Mr Kennedy. </p> <p>Reports have suggested that the Americans want the British to take over duties in Iskandariya, 25 miles south of Baghdad, releasing the 24th Marine Expeditionary Force for other operations. </p> <p>The most likely candidates for the role are thought to be the Black Watch, which is the reserve battalion in the British-controlled southern sector. </p> <p>That would mean placing some 650 British soldiers under direct US command for the duration of the operation. </p> <p>In a weekend letter to Mr Hoon, the shadow defence secretary, Nicholas Soames, said that a deployment to the US-controlled sector would represent \"a fundamental change\" in the nature of British involvement in Iraq. </p> <p>He argued that it was essential that any British troops sent had \"substantially robust\" rules of engagement to cope with the demands of operating alongside the Americans. </p> <p>He also suggested that deployment would be a \"political gesture\" to shore up the US president, George Bush, ahead of the November 2 elections. </p> <p>But the lord chancellor, Lord Falconer, insisted this morning that the decision was \"entirely not political\". </p> <p>\"It is entirely operational. It is a matter for the secretary of state to deal with later today,\" he told Today.</p>",
  "<p>Teachers, headteachers and the schools inspector today voiced their support for plans in the Tomlinson report to replace GCSEs and A-levels with a diploma, labelling the proposals a \"last chance saloon\" for secondary education.</p> <p>Unions representing the school workforce urged the government to back the reforms and ignore the pessimism of employer representatives, who this morning refused to back the proposals, which would see a 10-year timetable of reform leading to the introduction of the new diploma in 2014. </p> <p>The education secretary, Charles Clarke, is due to make a statement about the proposals in the Commons at 3pm today. The prime minister, Tony Blair, will then deliver his judgement in a speech tonight.</p> <p>Following the publication of Mike Tomlinson's report this morning, schools went head-to-head with employers over the reform.</p> <p>David Hart, the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers said: \"We are in the 'last chance saloon' for the reform of secondary education. If government, higher education and employers do not give the report a fair wind it will be a disaster. Those who allege that standards will fall need to be seen off, otherwise we will continue to have a system that is deeply flawed.\" </p> <p>However, business leaders said they did not believe the diploma would solve the lack of basic literacy and numeracy skills in the workforce. </p> <p>Richard Wilson, the head of business policy at the Institute of Directors (IoD), said: \"The IoD is sceptical about the thrust of the solutions proposed in the [Tomlinson] group's three reports and does not support the introduction of a diploma to replace GCSEs and A-levels. Above all, there is no guarantee that it would lead to higher standards or improvements in literacy and numeracy skills - the overwhelming concern of employers.\"</p> <p>The deputy director-general of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), John Cridland, added: \"The CBI cannot yet give a green light to these proposals. Business must be convinced that more will be gained than lost by reorganising 14 to 19-year olds' qualifications.\"</p> <p>In response, Mary Bousted, the general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers said: \"Rather than carping, the CBI and the employers would do better to work with the Tomlinson proposals, and get their act together on vocational training. </p> <p>\"They have a choice - either sit on the sidelines and criticise, or actively get involved and start to bring some order and shape to the multitude of vocational qualifications, some of which currently add little or no value to young people's skills base.\"</p> <p>Chris Keates, the acting general secretary of the National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers, said: \"At the point of publication, the report will become old news. The crucial issue now is not the report but how the government responds to it.\"</p> <p>The government now has to decide whether it will back the report in its totality, or adopt key parts and reject the rest. Mr Tomlinson has indicated that he does not believe the diploma would work if only parts of it were adopted. </p> <p>But the Department for Education and Skills is believed to have drawn up a timetable for implementation and part of the proposals are understood to be being written into the pre-election manifesto with a white paper mooted for next year. </p> <p>Steve Sinnott, the general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, pointed out that the implementation would be costly - not least because proposals to halve the 24% of 17-year-olds who are not currently in education means that tens of thousands of extra places at schools and colleges would need to be created. \"You cannot penny-pinch on a major reform such as this which has enormous implications for the future of our education system,\" he said. </p> <p>David Bell, Mr Tomlinson's successor as the chief inspector of schools, added to the weight of opinion in favour of the reforms, saying: \"The Tomlinson report demonstrates that there is a better way forward and I call upon the government to be bold and consider whether both GCSEs and A-levels in their current form need to be replaced by a new system that unleashes untapped talent and meets the needs of all young people.\"</p> <p>However, as well as employers, universities and private schools will be crucial to the reform's success. If they refuse to back the new diploma and continue to work with A-levels, then a two-tier system could emerge with state school pupils doing the diploma, and the private schools doing A-levels. </p> <p>Ivor Crewe, the president of Universities UK, the umbrella group for universities, said: \"The proposals offer the opportunity for universities to draw from a wider pool of well-qualified candidates from all sections of society. The report has also tackled the difficult problem of how universities can differentiate between the most able candidates, which has been a growing concern.\"</p> <p>A statement issued on behalf of private schools associations said it was pleased that the contents of A-levels would be contained within the diploma. But it warned that plans for an extended project to replace coursework could incur a greater risk of plagiarism.</p>",
  "The latest round of polls in the US election race shows the presidential candidates more or less tied, with Democratic hopeful John Kerry trailing Republican president George Bush by two or three percentage points, a gap still within a margin of error. <p>The latest <a href=\"http://www.zogby.com/news/ReadNews.dbm?ID=892\">Zogby/Reuters daily tracking poll</a> found Mr Kerry had shaved two points from the president's lead, leaving the Democrat trailing 46% to 44%. The poll of those who describe themselves as likely to vote in the November 2 election was conducted after the third and final presidential debate. The margin of error was 2.9 percentage points. </p> <p>John Zogby said on his website: \"The third debate is now registering among voters and Kerry had a good day, leading by two points today alone. He now is behind by only two overall. He managed today to regain a good lead among 18-29 year olds (especially 18-24 year olds, who he will need on November 2 to win).

It found Mr Kerry was the clear winner of the last debate, with almost one in three voters saying the debate had made them more likely to vote Democratic. Only 17% said the debate had made them more likely to vote for Mr Bush. </p> <p>Time also said Mr Bush's job approval rating had fallen, with 49% approving of his work and 49% disapproving after the last debate.

A Bush/Cheney ticket took 50% of likely voters, with Kerry/Edwards on only 44%. </p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/nation/polls/usatodaypolls.htm\">CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll</a>, also conducted after the debate, gave Mr Bush an even greater advantage. Among likely voters, 52% intended to vote for Mr Bush and 44% for Mr Kerry. The previous Gallup poll, conducted after the second debate, had given 49% to Mr Bush and 46% to Mr Kerry. The polls had a margin of error of four percentage points. </p> <p>Independent candidate Ralph Nader polled a fairly consistent 1% in all the above contests, meaning he could well prove a spoiler for Mr Kerry.</p>",

  "The defence secretary, Geoff Hoon, will confirm today that the British military is considering sending as many as 600 soldiers to previously US-patrolled hotspots south of Baghdad, as it considers a wider role for troops ahead of the planned elections in January. <p>British defence sources made clear yesterday that there was widespread unease among military commanders about the deployment, in particular the suggestion that troops were being used in a \"political gesture\" to support the agenda of the Bush administration in the run-up to the presidential election next month. \"There is unease about us being drawn in to the whole American election thing,\" one source said. </p> <p>Mr Hoon will today face what is likely to be a hostile House of Commons when he makes a statement on the proposed deployment, in the face of mounting criticism from both Labour backbenchers and the opposition. </p> <p>The defence secretary will seek to calm MPs and stress that no decision has been made. However, a battle group of 650 British troops from the Black Watch regiment has been earmarked to \"backfill\" for US marines policing the two highly volatile towns of Iskandariya and Latifiya, about 15 miles (25km) south of Baghdad. </p> <p>Nine Iraqi policemen were murdered at Latifiya on Saturday on their way back to Kerbala after a training course in Jordan. Both towns have been the scene of numerous attacks by insurgents. </p> <p>However, one government source insisted: \"We are in constant dialogue with the Americans. It is not the case that a five-star US general suddenly walks through the door and says he needs our troops.\" </p> <p>Although British defence chiefs are putting a brave face on the decision, saying the army is happy to do any job asked of it, privately they are worried about the prospect of getting bogged down in Iraq with no clear exit strategy. </p> <p>Ministers and army chiefs have repeatedly said that British troops will leave when the Iraqis have sufficient forces of their own to protect their country's security. </p> <p>General Sir Michael Walker, the chief of the defence staff, and General Sir Mike Jackson, the head of the army, are also understood to have expressed concern that the deployment of the Black Watch will leave a significant gap in British forces in southern Iraq. </p> <p>In Falluja yesterday US troops continued their siege of the rebel stronghold in an effort to keep suspected militants from fleeing before the start of a long expected full-scale ground offensive. </p> <p>In the Commons Mr Hoon will repeat the rejections by cabinet ministers yesterday of the allegation that British troop movements are being considered as a show of coalition solidarity with George Bush ahead of the elections in the US. </p> <p>Labour's general election supremo Alan Milburn said: \"People will look pretty askance at those who are saying somehow or other there is some sort of tawdry political deal that has been done here. </p> <p>\"That is the allegation that is being made that somehow or other this is about Britain acting in American political interests. It isn't about that at all. All of these decisions are taken on an operational basis. They are done in full consultation with the people on the ground.\" </p> <p>However, the deployment of British troops north to the bloodiest front in Iraq has direct and powerful significance for the knife-edge contest for the US presidency, in which the war has become the dominant issue. </p> <p>At the core of the Democratic attack on the Bush administration is the charge that its diplomatic failure and its bungled planning for the Iraq invasion has left US troops to shoulder almost all the military burden, accounting for 90% of coalition casualties. </p> <p>Sending British troops to the heart of the fighting would strengthen the Bush argument that the coalition is sharing the human costs and that the president is capable of persuading foreign countries to internationalise the occupation. </p> <p>In a letter to Mr Hoon, the Conservative defence spokes-man, Nicholas Soames, warned that sending troops to the US sector would represent a \"fundamental change\" in the nature of the British deploy ment in Iraq. He wanted assurances British troops would not be involved in the assault on Falluja and their tour of duty would not be lengthened. </p> <p>\"I am fully aware of the importance and the timing our American friends and allies attach to the Falluja offensive and the urgent arrest of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi,\" he said. </p> <p>Meanwhile the United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, further added to the pressure on the government, stating that the invasion of Iraq had done nothing to make the world a safer place. </p> <p>\"I cannot say the world is safer when you consider the violence around us, when you look around you and see the terrorist attacks around the world and you see what is going on in Iraq,\" he told ITV1's Jonathan Dimbleby programme.</p>",
  "Welcome to the Wrap, Guardian Unlimited's round-up of the best of the day's papers. <p> <b>UNEASE OVER US REQUEST FOR BRITISH TROOPS</b></p> <p>When, on a fine Monday morning, you find Kate Winslet grinning radiantly at you from virtually every front page, you might assume that there is very little news around. Fortunately the Wrap is on hand to ferret out the good stuff from the inner pages. </p> <p>First, the hard news: For any Brit who has ever heard an American expounding at length on how they saved the British in WWII (and the attendant \"you'd be speaking German today if it wasn't for us\" palaver), today's reports provide some small payback. Someone, it seems, needs a bit of help fighting that war-that-won't-go-away in Iraq. </p> <p>The US has requested British troops to patrol south of Baghdad, thus freeing up US soldiers for the continued fight in the rebel-held town of Falluja. But the request for the Black Watch immediately sparked fears that it was a ploy by George Bush to convince the American electorate that he had a strong coalition of countries supporting the war in Iraq. The defence secretary, Geoff Hoon, is to make a statement on the matter to the Commons today.</p> <p>\"People want to be reassured that our armed forces are not being asked to further President Bush's election campaign, or to clear up a mess left by American forces,\" the Telegraph says. </p> <p>The Independent feels the whole subject should be put off until after the November 2 election. The Guardian fears \"mission creep\", and argues that the Black Watch should stay where it is until a detailed exit strategy has been worked out. </p> <p>The Daily Mail can understand why the troop move may be necessary, but wants the full scrutiny of the Commons before it will agree. \"The prime minister has deceived us about almost every aspect of the Iraq war. It is his tragedy - and ours - that he will never be believed again, even if his case happens to be legitimate.\"</p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Politics/iraq/story/0,12956,1329816,00.html\">Hoon to face MPs over Iraq troops</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1329822,00.html\">Stop this mission creep</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2004/10/18/dl1801.xml&amp;sSheet=/opinion/2004/10/18/ixopinion.html\">Telegraph: The Black Watch knows its duty.

  "<p>Pierre Salinger, former press secretary to John F Kennedy and Lyndon B Johnson, and France's \"most French of Americans\", has died of heart failure at 79. </p> <p>He died in hospital near his home of Le Thor, outside Avignon, after recent surgery to fit a pacemaker, his wife, Nicole, said. </p> <p>The couple moved to the Vaucluse to run a B&amp;B when George Bush won the 2000 election. \"He was very upset because he thought Bush was not fit to be president,\" Mrs Salinger told the Associated Press. \"He said he would leave if Bush became president, and he did.\" </p> <p>Salinger was outspoken but cultivated, and had a distinguished career with ABC News after serving two Democrat presidents. Born to a French mother in San Francisco in 1925, he had two years on the San Francisco Chronicle before joining the US navy in 1943. Salinger returned to the paper after the war, then moved to Collier's magazine, and joined Kennedy's senatorial staff in 1957. </p> <p>A trusted member of the Kennedy clan's circle, Salinger was JFK's press secretary for the 1960 presidential campaign. He was White House press secretary from 1961 to 1964, ran the first live TV presidential news conference in 1961, and stayed on at the White House after Kennedy's 1963 assassination. After a brief spell as a senator, he returned to journalism in 1964. </p> <p>Kennedy, Salinger once said, \"was not a perfect man ... For all his loftiness of purpose, he did not take himself that seriously. He had no great vision of himself as a political or intellectual giant.\" </p> <p>The Massachusetts senator Edward Kennedy, the late president's brother, told AP yesterday: \"[Salinger] was a steady presence in the best and most difficult of times, and many members of my family sought his counsel on all of the most important issues of the day.\" </p> <p>\"His skill, genius, and judgment in the art of communication were legendary.\" </p> <p>Horrified by the killing of Robert Kennedy, Salinger moved to France and worked for the news weekly L'Express before becoming ABC's bureau chief in London and Paris, and then the organisation's chief foreign correspondent. He spent a total of 19 years in the French capital, and in 1978 was awarded France's highest civilian honour, the L\u00e9gion d'Honneur. </p> <p>The French prime minister, Jean-Pierre Raffarin, paid tribute to a \"passionate journalist and writer ... [who] contributed unfailingly, through his action and his talent, to improving the ties of friendship which unite our two countries.\" </p> <p>Salinger won several prizes, including a George Polk award for his 1981 scoop that the US was secretly negotiating to free the Americans held hostage by Iran. </p> <p>In the 1990s he repeatedly questioned the official lines on two air crashes, claiming the 1988 downing of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie was a US drug enforcement agency operation that went wrong, and that TWA flight 800 was shot down near Long Island by a stray US navy missile in 1996. </p> <p>He was hugely popular in France, known for his near-perfect command of the language, strong American accent, and love for the Gallic way of life. He quoted Thomas Jefferson's dictum: \"Every man has two countries - his own, and France.\" However, he always said the country would benefit from \"the exigencies of American democracy\". The outcome of Watergate, forcing Richard Nixon to resign in 1973, would be \"unimaginable\" in France, Salinger said. </p> <p>He is survived by Nicole, his fourth wife, and sons Stephen and Gregory; and will be buried in Arlington national cemetery in Washington.</p>",
  "If ever there was an example of mission creep, the request from the US for the redeployment of some British troops in support of Americans south of Baghdad, is as dangerous as they come. There were conflicting reports last night about the precise location to which they would be sent, but it will be in an insurgent area - an area which can expect retaliation when the long expected full-scale ground assault on Fallujah begins. Fallujah is believed to be the stronghold of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi's Tawhid wal Jihad group, which killed British hostage Kenneth Bigley. If agreed, the British troops would be the first to have operated in direct support of the Americans - and the first to have been engaged inside the Sunni area south of Baghdad. No wonder senior military officials have been voicing concern. Deployment would mark a major escalation in Britain's involvement in the occupation of Iraq, yet so far there has been no public discussion, no official details, or even the most peremptory parliamentary debate. <p>A Ministry of Defence spokesman yesterday said no decision had yet been made on the US request, but that Defence Secretary Geoff Hoon would be ready to make a \"holding statement\" in the Commons this afternoon. This is not nearly good enough. What is needed is a full-scale parliamentary debate before the decision is made, not after it. Robin Cook, the former foreign secretary, was right to warn yesterday that if British troops were deployed in the US sector, they could find themselves associated with the more aggressive tactics use by the Americans. The last major exercise by the US against Fallujah left 1,000 civilians dead and caused uproar in and outside Iraq over the heavy-handed tactics of American forces. Mr Cook was right to note the danger that \"if Britain frees up US forces for the next assault, we may be held equally responsible by Iraqis for what happens to residents of Fallujah\". </p> <p>One of many unexplained factors is why the US needs 650 British troops. The unit which would be redeployed if Britain agrees is a 650-strong battle group of the Black Watch regiment, currently based in Basra, but leaving that area less able to maintain stability if it is sent. The unit they would replace is the 24th Marine Expeditionary Force, which is expected to be used in the Fallujah operation. But currently there are 138,000 US troops in Iraq. True, many of them are reservists rather than fully-trained professionals, but do they really not have 650 properly trained replacements among their 138,000-strong occupation force? This has prompted speculation among senior British military circles that the request is prompted more by President Bush's electoral interests rather than military needs. More gruesome has been the talk in some US circles of the need for British troops to \"share more of the load\". There have been 68 British troops killed compared to 1,062 American. But this is all the more reason why we need a well-informed debate. </p> <p>Even Nicholas Soames, the Conservative defence spokesman, has expressed fears that the redeployment of British troops could be a \"political gesture\" designed to help President Bush in the run up to the November 2 election. Meanwhile there were reports yesterday that the prime minister had secretly agreed to allow the US to station interceptor missiles on British soil as part of its controversial \"Son of Star Wars\" missile defence programme. If true, this would be another serious military decision taken behind closed doors. Rather than a \"holding statement\", what we need today is a straight, honest and full statement on the Iraq operation, plus a debate about its costs and strategic implications. Until then - and until ministers have set out a detailed exit strategy - parliament should do all in its power to resist any further mission creep.</p>",
  "Belarus has voted to allow its president, Alexander Lukashenko, the right to run for a third term in office, the top election official said this morning. <p>Lidiya Ermoshina, the head of the Central Election Commission, told a news conference that 77.3% of registered voters in the former Soviet state had backed Mr Lukashenko's proposal to remove a constitutional provision limiting him to two terms. </p> <p>The president, 50, whom the US has called \"the last dictator in Europe\", has ruled since 1994. His second term is due to expire in 2006. He required a 50% turnout for the poll to be valid. </p> <p>\"If people say 'yes', I will work harder and be more certain in my actions,\" Mr Lukashenko said after casting his ballot. \"I do not work on behalf of clans or interest groups. I work for the people.\" </p> <p>He dismissed western criticism of the vote and accusations of disregard for human rights. \"For 10 years you have been concerned about something or other in Belarus,\" he said. \"Try to calm down and stop accusing us.\" </p> <p>A Gallup opinion poll suggested recently that only 41% of the population were in favour of the proposed amendment to the constitution. The EU and US have said they expect irregularities. </p> <p>\"Our relations are already not very good,\" the British ambassador, Brian Bennett, told Reuters. \"If the referendum is not fair, it will mean the situation here is worse than we wanted it to be and we will have to react.\" </p> <p>The opposition claimed the ballot was rigged. </p> <p>While the polls were open, a government-endorsed exit poll showed the measure passing. </p> <p>Belarus, whose 10 million people live on an average wage of \u00a380 a month, has strict controls on the media and little functioning political opposition. Four prominent opposition politicians disappeared in 2000. </p> <p>Mr Lukashenko used a referendum in 1996 to prolong his first term to seven years.</p>",
  "The panto season in Liverpool opens a trifle early this year as Boris Johnson, editor of the Spectator, MP for Henley and shadow culture secretary, voyages north on a mission of \"complete humility\". Sorry, so sorry. He'll cringe to Croxteth, grovel in Garston, kowtow to Knotty Ash, fall on his sword for Fazakerley, prostrate himself at Pier Head. <p>Sorry, so sorry. The pictures of blond bombshells imploding round Aigburth are bound to be wonderful. The sketch writers can barely contain their glee. Let Tony look on and learn as Boris demonstrates the art of abject apology. Yet beneath the big fuss, there's a smaller issue here worth teasing into the open. For even if Boris was wrong, it's certain that Michael Howard - dispatching him on this sorry trip - wasn't right. And thus a tangle of journalistic and political ethics begins to unravel. </p> <p>How did Boris err so grossly? New readers start here. The latest Spectator carries a long editorial which argues, in brief, that too much public grief was expended over Ken Bigley's death, that Liverpool in particular sorrowed too floridly for one of its sons, and that anyway Mr Bigley knowingly put himself in danger. Of course he died a horrible death, but since when have pre-match silences at football matches marked the killing in action of British soldiers? </p> <p>Now, you may not agree with that argument. You may not like the editorial's side swipe at Liverpool's \"peculiar and deeply unattractive psyche\" built on an \"excessive predilection for welfarism\". You may angrily resent the resurrection of the Hillsborough tragedy 15 years on as evidence of the city's failure to face reality \"even to this day\". But does any of this mean that the unsigned leader shouldn't have been printed? Its underlying point - that too much public display over Mr Bigley's murder probably encourages his terrorist assassins, who seek such media display and kill their victims to secure it - isn't a stupid one. </p> <p>It often meanders miasmically, to be sure, hurling in Princess Di, Scott of the Antarctic and the Lone Ranger for luck. But this is the Spectator, not the Liverpool Echo or even the Sun. You don't pay your \u00a32.50 a week for calm rationality and sober prose. You pay to watch Boris and chums go berserk. </p> <p>Why, then, will the editor be pleading for mercy on the Mersey this week? Because, as the editorial itself says, Liverpool \"has a tribal sense of community\", because when scratched it bleeds and lashes back. The irate reaction of councillors, MPs and the rest was predictable and also, in its way, proof of the city's exceptional condition. It isn't Henley or Guildford or Reading, laid-back spots that Boris may know better from his daily round. It has a heart and it roars with pain. Fifteen years on, it still punishes the Sun over Hillsborough. Why take such stick now from a Tory MP? </p> <p>Ah! The problem isn't journalism, but politics. Mr Howard has a known affection for Liverpool and its eponymous football club. He probably misses Michael Owen more than he would miss Boris Johnson. He also knows a political own goal as it thunders by him. So Boris has \"been asked to go to Liverpool and apologise in person\". Leader's orders. \"I'm very much looking forward to it,\" says Boris, with legendary insincerity. The crucial question is: in which capacity does he go? </p> <p>When an editor publishes an editorial, he stands behind its views whether they come from his own terminal or not. I guess (because its logic often coagulates) that this particular piece wasn't all Boris's own work, but the point of principle remains. It is a collective Spectator opinion, the responsibility of an independent editor accountable to his readers and to his proprietors, the Barclay twins. It has nothing to do with Mr Howard. He doesn't edit or own the Spectator. He has no standing. If he's unhappy, he can write a letter for publication. He can't tell Boris what to do - and, if he does, Boris should take no notice. Scurrying north, a shadow culture minister rushing to appease a European City of Culture because Michael says so, is a craven confusion. </p> <p>Why, if Boris apologises for this, a supplicant to Speke, shouldn't other Spectator victims have him grovelling on their doormats, too? Shouldn't Peter Oborne apologise to Tony Blair for being so consistently beastly? Shouldn't Mark Steyn apologise to John Kerry for being so ludicrously baleful? Shouldn't Paul Johnson apologise for virtually anything you care to name? </p> <p>The trouble, of course, is too many roles. There's a curious Telegraph tradition of mixing political activism with not-so independent journalism. Charles Moore (in the offending Spectator) affectionately recalls the dear old days when Jock Bruce-Gardyne MP also wrote leaders \"and travelled between the two jobs on a bicycle\". A somewhat less loveable MEP still plays that dual role today. Many a time and oft, lofty Telegraph writers would pen a speech for a matching politician then watch their own words be published as some high minister's work. Yet, back to Boris and basics: which master calls the tune? </p> <p>You can, just about, be a free parliamentary spirit and edit a magazine like the Spectator or the New Statesman. Iain Macleod and Dick Crossman both did that long ago. But Boris Johnson is a youngish man on the make, a climber of the greasy poll who sits in shadow cabinets and plays the collective game. He's affable and charming and a bit of a card, as good at mixing drinks as he is at mixing metaphors, and the party faithful love him. Yet none of that makes him a truly free spirit as he rushes to make peace in the 'Pool. Journalism or politics? Boris, I think, has that most trendy of policy decisions to make now amid all his humility: he has a choice. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:p.preston@theguardian.com\">p.preston@theguardian.com</a></p>"
