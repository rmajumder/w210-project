  "<b>Frost bite</b> <br> <p>Your editorial (Comment, last week) concerning the US Presidential election stated that America is about to reach a fork in the road and has, so far, shown indecision on which direction to take. Perhaps you might have referred to the great American Laureate, Robert Frost, who, in his poem 'The Road not Taken', shows his understanding of such indecisiveness. The Bush team maligns the challenger's 'flip-flop' indecision, but surely the American electorate can distinguish between a man who would know and understand what Frost was talking about and the present incumbent.</p> <p>One can only hope that American voters are better read than their President and that they take the road less travelled and make all the difference about how the US is perceived.<br> <b>James Callaghan</b><br> Urmston, Manchester<br></p> <p><b>Labour for all</b><br> </p> <p>According to Alan Milburn, Labour exists for a simple reason - 'to make life better for hard-working families' (Comment, last week). Does this mean that it does not aim to make life better for: individuals who do not live in families; people who are unable to work; or people who prioritise a better work-life balance? Presumably not.

  "<p>Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Californian governor, dubbed presidential hopeful John Kerry an 'economic girlie man' at the Republican party's New York convention last month. </p> <p>But the Governator was holding something back - he didn't tell those endorsing the Bush candidacy that he hadn't been man enough to get to the Big Apple under his own steam. Schwarzenegger's trip to New York - worth a whopping $350,000 - was paid in large part by Pfizer, the biggest drug company in the world. </p> <p>Just why Pfizer backs Arnie and the Republicans is now a campaign issue in the California Senate race. Pharmaceutical firms are desperate to see Republicans maintain control of the Golden State. The Hollywood star turned politician has received close to $500,000 from pharmaceutical companies since beginning his run for office last year. </p> <p>But recent events could backfire badly on the Governator and his paymasters. Furthermore, there are growing calls for all Schwarzenegger's drug money to be paid back. An unseemly row is brewing over sick and old people in California, too poor to buy medicine, organising themselves to take trains up to Canada, where drug prices are much lower. The drugs are imported back to California and distributed to the needy. In trade-law speak, this is known as 'parallel importation', and under intellectual property law it is highly contentious. </p> <p>It seems Pfizer's and other drug firm's campaign donations initially paid off. Earlier this month, Schwarzenegger rejected Democrat proposals targeting the high cost of prescription drugs. Part of these proposals was to legitimise parallel importation from Canada. Schwarzenegger said the measures would have broken federal law and made the state vulnerable to lawsuits if anyone got ill from imported drugs. Not true, said the Democrats. </p> <p>A similar debate is raging across the rest of the US, and it is, for the most part, split down party lines. That explains why drug-firm donations to the Republicans far outstrip those to the Democrats. In the 2002 election cycle, out of total contributions of $29.4m, drug firms lavished $21.7m on the party of George W Bush. </p> <p>Joel Bakan's new book, The Corporation, shows how, after donating more than $1m to Congressional candidates - most of them Republicans - during the 2001 election cycle, Eli Lilly was the beneficiary of a provision buried in the Homeland Security Act that protected makers of thimerosal, a preservative used in vaccines, from lawsuits arising out of harm caused by the drug's use. Eli Lilly was the sole manufacturer of the substance. </p> <p>The provision was eventually removed after intense public outcry.</p>",
  "<p>Rarely can politics have been held in lower regard in the civilised world than it is today. According to the press, the governments of the United States, Britain, Germany, France and Japan have never seen their stars lower in the ascendant. The vitriol meted out to President Bush by virtually every non-American newspaper is staggering, and if it were up to them, Bush would be history on 2 November. </p> <p>Although the likes of George Soros and Warren Buffett have, surprisingly, come to the aid of John Kerry - as has the rather grubby and pernicious Michael Moore - this may not be sufficient to oust Bush from Pennsylvania Avenue. Bill Clinton is leaving his sickbed on Monday in the hope that his silver tongue will persuade wavering voters to rally to the Demo crat flag. But, alas, it is not Clinton who is seeking election. </p> <p>In the UK, the weight of money suggests that Bush, though not exactly home and hosed, is in with a great shout to be returned as commander-in-chief for another four years. It really doesn't matter a jot what the press and the public outside the US think of him. The fact remains that middle America's support is all that counts. </p> <p>Were the votes left to the young, The 'Kids' Vote', sponsored by Nickelodeon, sees Kerry in by 57 per cent to 43 per cent. Conversely, Scholastic, which claims to have had the most accurate poll since 1960, believes that pupils polled from first grade to eighth grade support Bush, 52 per cent to 47 per cent. </p> <p>In other words, this election is going down to the wire. The electorate has a choice between what are perceived as two deeply average candidates, both flawed in different areas. </p> <p>Kerry should have nailed Bush on the economy months ago. He also failed to gather momentum after three effective TV performances. That may well count against him on the day of reckoning. On balance, the hot money tells us that voters are probably more comfortable with Bush, with security of the nation against terrorism and the strong leadership he provides the orders of the day. </p> <p>Perhaps the devil you know is better than the one you don't?

  "<p>'I'm trying to bridge art and commerce,' mumbled Ian Schrager in a heavy Brooklyn drawl while sipping an iced Coke in the bar of his stylish St Martin's Lane hotel in London's West End. 'I'm still looking for my masterpiece.' </p> <p>The 58-year-old hotelier describes himself as 'a home-run hitter'. In other words his projects don't fiddle round the edges. They make an impact. </p> <p>This is no exaggeration. It was Schrager who jointly founded and ran New York's Studio 54 which, in the Seventies, was the world's most famous nightclub and disco's holy shrine of hedonistic excess. Following a year in jail for tax evasion, he went on to redefine hotels with a blend of nightclub chic and provocative, ironic design. </p> <p>Schrager, with his French partner Philippe Starck, tapped into nascent wannabe celebrity culture, created the first boutique hotels and made lobbies a place to be seen in. But today there is a big question he has to face up to: Is he past it or is there something left to bring to the party? </p> <p>His business empire has hit a crossroads. His nine luxury hotels are only just emerging from serious financial difficulties. But if the Brooklyn-born law graduate can create a new genre in entertainment it would see the 58-year-old hotelier emerge triumphant as perhaps the most vivid encapsulation of style and commerce over the last 30 years. </p> <p>In his first newspaper interview since his difficulties emerged, Schrager appears chastened, but has no doubt about his place in the scheme of things: 'I'm in the opportunity business. I started in hotels responding to the opportunity. When I sold Studio 54, I was given an IOU. \"What have you got?\" \"A hotel.\" I took it. We traded.' </p> <p>The trading shows no sign of stopping now. Schrager is gearing up for a new phase. Whether it follows the template he masterminded from his backroom at Studio 54 - the media frenzy, the celeb clientele, the smart design - is unclear. That reached a glittering lucrative climax in the manic run-up to the new millennium, when it was said that his hotel empire rang up profits of \u00a3120m. </p> <p>But the party gave way to a mighty hangover. The dotcom bubble burst, planes flew into New York buildings and George Bush invaded Iraq. The hotel market has been on its knees since. </p> <p>For Schrager, the pummelling was severe. Bank covenants of $355m were breached last year and his hotel in San Francisco, the Clift, filed for bankruptcy protection. </p> <p>Media reports over the last year have centred on whether style gurus have tired of his creations; his space eaten away by imitators. Schrager acknowledges imitation and has a word for it: 'Schragerisation'. But he insists only a 'visionary and not a functionary' can carry it off. 'I don't mean that to sound...' Arrogant? 'It's not arrogant.' </p> <p>Schrager is undoubtedly a tough nut. And he is in town to put the record straight. After a year's silence, his message is that he is back and soaking up new influences. Trips to Istanbul and Croatia are feeding the muse. Ecleticism and bohemia is where it's at, he reckons. Far harder to imitate than minimalism. </p> <p>Travelling the world, Schrager is only taking on projects that take his fancy. He is working on hotel projects in New York with new design partners, John Pawson and multimedia artist Julian Schnabel. He has commissioned Herzog and De Meuron to build the first major new building in New York for years. Those who know him say he should do more in Europe. 'He doesn't realise how successful he could be there,' said one business partner. </p> <p>As for financial difficulties, Schrager says they are behind him. His bank debt has been refinanced. The Clift has emerged from bankruptcy protection with 'creditors getting 100 cents in the dollar'. Its demise was 'an embarrassing mistake that should never have happened', brought on by the downturn in Silicon Valley's dotcom industry. The Clift is ringfenced from his other assets. </p> <p>Now he is engaged in the sale of his two London hotels, the Sanderson and St Martin's Lane. The timing could hardly be better. The London market is on the march again after three years in the doldrums. Room occupancy rates are rising. US businessmen and tourists are returning. London is, for obvious reasons, their only European destination. </p> <p>Hotels were further rejuvenated by the \u00a3750m sale of the Savoy Group by US investor Blackstone to an Irish consortium. This deal worked out at more than \u00a31m per room. And a wall of money from overseas investors is beating a path to London to buy up trophy assets. </p> <p>For more than a year, Schrager's hotel business partner, the property firm Burford, has been trying to persuade Schrager to sell his two London establishments. Last August he relented. Schrager wants \u00a3200m but associates say anything over \u00a3150m would be a result. Schrager is adamant he will retain management of the hotels. But others say he could be bought out. </p> <p>He grew up in Brooklyn's East Flatbush. From good Jewish middle-class stock, his father - who was big in real estate - would have blanched at the thought of his son making a living running nightclubs. </p> <p>Although if you believe rumours - always flatly denied by Schrager junior - his father was used to living near the edge, with alleged Mob connections. Both parents had died by the time Schrager was 24. They were spared the trauma of his time in jail. It was a time when life was out of control. </p> <p>Studio 54 introduced the world to the purple rope, an 'in-crowd' door policy. It was where Andy Warhol, David Bowie and Mick Jagger partied and Bianca Jagger famously made her entrance on a white horse. It was also where raiding police found $1m in bin bags hidden in the club's ceiling. A further $2.5m was believed to have been 'skimmed'. </p> <p>Prison hit Schrager hard. For months he was held in a maximum-security wing, rubbing shoulders with murderers. He paid inmates to keep him from harm. But prison was in a sense the making of him; he had time to develop his new hotel concept. </p> <p>His colourful life belies his understated manner. But he doesn't miss a trick. 'I used to travel between Boston and New York. The Boston skirts weren't as short as in New York.' </p> <p>Schrager last year flew to Iraq with US General Tommy Franks to 'be a part of history'. He believes the negative portrayal of the war by the New York Times is misguided, but he will back John Kerry when the US goes to the polls next month, citing Bush's mismanagement of the economy as his main reason. </p> <p>His free time is spent with his two daughters Sophia, 10, and Ava, seven. He is divorced from his wife Rita, a former ballet dancer. 'For most of my life, business was my life. I'm 58. I had kids in my late forties. I can afford to be selfless and patient. Maybe 10 years ago I wouldn't have been like that.' </p> <p>He delights in recalling how his elder daughter confessed to him that she can never pre-plan what she is going to wear because it never looks right. Schrager wears a green woollen V-neck over a white T-shirt. 'That's it. I'm the same,' he said, raising his hands like Robert de Niro's brother. </p> <p>But there could be a downside to having Schrager as your dad. His simply furnished, gargantuan 4,000 sq ft apartment in Nolita, that's 'North of Little Italy', is all white, even the curtains. Make a mess at your peril. </p> <p>You wonder if now, at 58, he doesn't tire of the endless demand to create hype; to ensure the kooky product not only enthralls but satisfies demanding customers. 'I will always be doing something. I need to.' Celebrity pals include Madonna, De Niro and Bowie.

  "It seems Americans like nothing more than seeing the Queen on the throne, but when it comes to George Bush sitting on his, they are altogether more squeamish. <p>Whether it's the political climate within which they live - just under two weeks before election day - or whether Alison Jackson's art is just a little too close to the truth, one thing is clear; they might get the joke, but not all of them like it. </p> <p>Jackson's first US solo show, entitled Election Year 2004, opened in New York on Thursday night showing a selection of new, and some not-so-new images for which she has become known. The grainy pieces, reminiscent of snatched paparazzi photographs show politicians, royalty and celebrities usually in compromising positions, yet ones that are not so far removed from reality that at first glance they might be real. </p> <p>However, all is not what it seems: Jackson uses look-alikes to portray all the celebrities and public figures. </p> <p>Visitors to her show yesterday were treated to Elton John being given an enema, a rather bored looking Mick Jagger hanging lacy black underwear next to a toddler's outfit on a suburban washing line, and the Queen sitting on the toilet reading a newspaper. </p> <p>There were lots of pictures with a George Bush lookalike - in one he is using Tony Blair as a footstool to get on his horse, in another he practises his shooting skills on images of Osama Bin Laden and Michael Moore (the latter the more often hit target). </p> <p>Yet it was President Bush sitting on the toilet reading a comic that caused the most consternation. </p> <p>Owen Clements, 22, a gallery assistant from New York said that he walked past the gallery most days and had seen the picture of Bush getting on his horse; he thought it was real until he visited the exhibition. He was uncomfortable with the image of Mr Bush in the bathroom, yet found the similar one of the Queen amusing. His friend Haley Cohen suggested this was accounted for by his US-centric viewpoint. </p> <p>He replied: \"It's not funny but Americans are so offended by him that it's an image that's probably not so far from the truth which makes them more depressing.\" </p> <p>Jackson, whose images appear weekly in Guardian Weekend magazine, has created the occasional storm. Her controversial work first gained notoriety in 1999 when she gave us an insight into another dimension - Princess Diana was 'pictured' with a mixed-race child, next to Dodi Fayed. </p> <p>But the outrage was thin on the ground in New York, where the big concern seemed to be more about getting rid of Mr Bush rather than getting angry at satirical photographs of him. </p> <p>Josh C Nusbaum, 29, from Long Island City, said: \"I don't care about seeing any more anti-Bush art, I'd rather just get him out of the White House. Perhaps I'd have had a different view if I saw this earlier in the year.\" </p> <p>Outside New York it could be a different story, said Leslie Tonkonow, 45, a gallery owner: \"I don't think it's something that would offend people in New York, but if it was shown in other parts of the country then it certainly could.\" </p> <p>After the exhibition Jackson was pleased with the response to her photographs. \"People really seemed to enjoy the work,\" she said. \"It was very bizarre to see people's reactions. One woman was laughing so hard she was almost on the floor, but maybe that's because Americans are more outspoken than British. You just wouldn't see that at a show in Britain.\" </p> <p>She was also surprised by how open-minded they were and explained how a group of elderly women had attended a preview. \"They were really having a good laugh ... they seemed to love the filthiness.\" </p>",
  "<p>Kerry Michael kicks off his tenure as the Theatre Royal's new director by presenting an intriguing first play by a young Turkish-Cypriot actor, Cosh Omar. It's sometimes a bit messy and ill-organised, but it gives you a real sense of what it's like to be a young Turk living in London and of the tensions with the Greek Cypriots in and around north London's Green Lanes. </p> <p>Omar himself plays the hero, Erol, in desperate search of his identity. His father runs a cafe that proudly sports posters of Ataturk. His uncle, busy doing property deals in Cyprus, is an even more defiant patriot. But Erol's best mates, including Maria whom he hotly fancies, are all Greek Cypriots. His sense of confusion is intensified by a pair of Muslim missionaries who seek to persuade him to abandon his western existence and join the fight to create an Islamic state. </p> <p>The play captures well the way the past, for Turkish Cypriots, constantly bears down on the present. Old Turkish men invoke the heroism of Gallipoli. A romantic mother rhapsodises about an \"an ethnographical fruit cake\" in which Greek and Turkish Cypriots were once happily mixed. Meanwhile, the Muslim ideologues fervently preach about the way the west has divided Islam by fostering a competitive nationalism. But, although Omar vividly conveys the multiple pressures on a young Turk, his play doesn't so much grow organically as lurch from one illustrative point to another. </p> <p>Omar convincingly embodies the bereft, confused hero. And Kerry Michael's production, neatly designed by Yannis Thavoris, boasts lively supporting performances from George Georgiou as the hero's closeted best friend, Elena Pavli as his cheerfully promiscuous girl and Rez Kempton as a persuasive Islamic recruiting agent. Whatever its dramatic deficiencies, the play certainly annexes new theatrical territory. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Until November 13. Box office: 020-8534 0310.</p>",
  "For a generation or more, it has been an article of faith, at least in Europe, that the nation state is in profound decline. The rise of globalisation, growing economic interdependence, the spread of new international organisations and the power of multinationals, not to mention the European Union itself, suggested that the future lay in new forms of global and regional governance. This was a delusion. The opposite is happening. Nation states will be the decisive players in global affairs over the next few decades. <p>So much is already clear with the United States. During the cold war, it behaved as a superpower constrained by its allies. Since 9/11 it has acted as Prometheus unbound, a nation state answerable to nobody but itself. Even if John Kerry is elected president, the US will not revert to its pre-9/11 behaviour. Kerry may emphasise the importance of allies, but the unilateralist instincts of the sole superpower will not be put back in the bottle. </p> <p>The weakness of Europe as a global player is also a reminder of the efficacy of the nation state. Economically, the EU remains a formidable force, rivalling the American economy. As a political player, though, it pales into insignificance in comparison. Unable to act with any decision even in the Balkans, its impotence has been all too transparent over Iraq, where the EU has essentially been reduced to its component parts, most graphically illustrated by the divergent roles of Britain and France. </p> <p>Whatever the lament about the dangers of a European superstate, it is inconceivable that this will change in the foreseeable future. Europe cannot act in concert outside of itself because it is divided into nation states whose interests remain distinct and divergent. The recently expanded union will serve only to make this more true, with the consequence that Europe will continue to be a weak and marginal player in global affairs. </p> <p>Even Iraq is a reminder of the importance of the nation state. Before the invasion, liberal imperialists liked to emphasise the limits of sovereignty, and to extol the virtues of imperial power acting to promote human rights and democracy, intervening in order to \"civilise the uncivilised\". They have gone a little quiet recently, for two reasons I would guess. Firstly, the US has behaved in the way that imperial powers always behave; it is an illusion to believe that it has ever seriously or systematically promoted democracy or human rights outside its own territory. And secondly, Iraq's resistance movement has reminded the world of the power of self-determination, of the resentment felt against rule by an overweening power from an alien culture and race. This was the lesson of the anti-colonial struggle, which somehow had been conveniently forgotten. National sovereignty and independent nation states matter, not just for countries such as Britain that have enjoyed this condition for centuries, but no less for those for which this is a historically novel experience. </p> <p>There is another sense, though, in which we are likely to see the resurgence of the nation state. The last century was dominated in its first half by medium-sized European nation states, and then subsequently by the rather larger US and Soviet Union. Of the world's presently five most populous countries - China, India, the US, Indonesia and Brazil (in descending order) - only the US has been a major global power during the course of the last half-century. This picture, however, is about to change; indeed, given the rise of China, it is already changing. </p> <p>Over the next half-century, the world is likely to assume a rather different shape. For the first time in the modern era, the world's two most populous countries (by a huge margin) will become major global players in their own right. It will mark the biggest watershed in global affairs since the birth of the modern nation state system. </p> <p>China and India, with well over a third of the world's population, will become major arbiters of all our futures. Compare that with the late 19th century, when Germany, France and Britain were the dominant powers, while accounting for only around 7% of the world's population (excluding their colonies, of course): or the US and the Soviet Union, which, by the end of the cold war, contained slightly over 10% of the world's population. The emergence of China and India as global powers will, in contrast to any previous period in modern history, introduce a rough and ready democracy to global affairs: the west, still the overwhelmingly dominant power in the world, represents only 17% of humanity, even on the most generous definition of the term. </p> <p>The arrival of China and India on the world scene will reinforce the importance of the nation state. They will dominate east Asia and south Asia respectively, which between them have well over half the world's population. Any trend in those regions towards the pooling of sovereignty along the lines of the EU, as in the case of the Association of South-East Asian Nations, will be secondary rather than predominant tendencies. The same can be said globally. India and China are, and will be, very different kinds of nation states from those that we are familiar with in the west. Not only are they far more populous - a novelty in its own right - they are also products of very different histories, cultures and races. </p> <p>Perhaps China provides the starkest illustration of the emergence of a new kind of nation state. Populous countries are often prone to fissure, the most recent example being the Soviet Union, while Indonesia is undoubtedly the least stable of the present top five. After Tiananmen Square in 1989, it was widely assumed in the west that the communist regime would fall, as it had in the Soviet Union, and that the country might even split. Neither happened. A crucial difference was that while the USSR was very multiracial, the Han account for the vast majority of Chinese. </p> <p>As Jared Diamond puts it in Guns, Germs and Steel: while five of the world's six most populous countries are creations of the past 200 years or so, China, is more than 2,000 years old. This is a nation state possessed of an extraordinary centripetal unity, its cohesion born of history and ethnicity. The fact that its population is almost twice that of North America and the EU combined provides an insight into its novelty as a nation state. </p> <p>None of this is to deny the importance of growing global integration, of which the EU is one example. Similarly, the accretion of a body of international law and the mushrooming of international institutions, such as the World Trade Organisation and the international criminal court (ICC), are intimations of a nascent sense of global community. But these tendencies have lulled many commentators into underestimating the continuing strength and importance of the nation state. </p> <p>The emergence of the US as a unilateral superpower was a rude reminder of where power is really located: indeed, it has sought to withdraw from, boycott or ignore the Kyoto treaty, the ICC and other bodies.

  "He has accused the country of being part of the axis of evil, a harbourer of al-Qaida terrorists and a nuclear menace threatening global stability. <p>So President George Bush may view with suspicion a ringing election endorsement from one of America's current enemies. Iran has thrown its weight behind the Bush campaign, saying it is unimpressed with John Kerry. </p> <p>\"We haven't seen anything good from the Democrats,\" said Hasan Rowhani, head of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, on state television. \"We do not desire to see Democrats take over ... We should not forget that most sanctions and economic pressures were imposed on Iran during the time of [former Democratic president Bill] Clinton. And we should not forget that during Bush's era - despite his hardline and baseless rhetoric against Iran - he didn't take, in practical terms, any dangerous action against Iran.\" </p> <p>Iran's declaration, however, is unlikely to be used on the stump by Mr Bush, despite the closeness of the race. </p> <p>\"It's not an endorsement we'll be accepting any time soon,\" said a Bush spokesman, Scott Stanzel, who suggested that Tehran should concentrate on pledging to \"stop its pursuit of nuclear weapons\". </p> <p>With the adage that \"with friends like these, who needs enemies\" probably springing to mind, Mr Kerry's spokeswoman, Allison Dobson, said: \"It is telling that this president has received the endorsement of a member of the 'axis of evil'.\" </p> <p>Washington severed diplomatic ties with Iran after militants stormed the US embassy in Tehran in 1979 and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days. America supported Iraq in the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war, and relations plummeted again when Mr Bush accused Iran of being part of an \"axis of evil\" with North Korea and pre-war Iraq. </p> <p>Since then, US forces have accused the Iranians of fomenting violence in Iraq. </p> <p>However, Mr Rowhani did not seem to think that Iran would be targeted next. \"At least Republicans have come to the conclusion in our region that militarism and invasion has not only failed to bring any results but, on the contrary, it is threatening their interests.\" </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Mr Bush gained another foreign endorsement yesterday when Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's prime minister, said he \"hoped and believed\" the US president would win. But his prophecy may not be that reassuring. Mr Berlusconi confidently predicted victory for Spain's Jos\u00e9 Maria Aznar in March, only for the incumbent to lose.</p>",
  "When South Africa's worst mass murderer, Louis van Schoor, is released on parole from Fort Glamorgan prison on Friday, his 23-year-old daughter, Sabrina - who hired a hitman to slit her mother's throat - will remain in her cell in the same jail. She will be nearly middle-aged by the time she is reunited with her baby daughter. <p>The two Eastern Cape cases titled State v Van Schoor both turn on racism and violence, the enduring fault lines in South African life a decade after the country's first democratic election. Louis, a former policeman turned security guard, is thought to have shot 101 black people, killing 39 of them, in East London shortly before apartheid imploded in 1990. Eleven years later, Sabrina planned the murder of her mother, a prominent businesswoman in nearby Queenstown, on the grounds that Beverley van Schoor was a racist. </p> <p>When he was finally arrested, three and a half years after killing his first victim, van Schoor was hailed a hero by his community for protecting whites against black criminals. His supporters, who packed East London's high court for the trial in 1992, drove cars with bumper stickers of a heart pierced by two bullet holes and blood dripping from the wounds, and the words \"I Love Louis\". At her trial in June 2002, Sabrina's admirers - the same South Africans who had lived in fear of her father - crowded into the public gallery to commend her for striking a blow against racism by murdering her mother. Her lawyer, a black man, compared Sabrina's need to free herself from her mother's oppression to the plight of South Africa's freedom fighters under apartheid. </p> <p>The run-down port of East London, the scene of Louis van Schoor's carnage, is in the poorest and most politicised province of the country. It was here that Sabrina was born, the only daughter of Beverley, who had three sons from a previous marriage. The family lived on a smallholding on the outskirts of the city, but the marriage, stormy from the start, did not last. By the time Sabrina was four, her mother had fled to Queenstown, about 100 miles away, leaving the little girl to live with her maternal grandmother in East London while the boys went to a boarding school, so that Beverley could concentrate on establishing a new life. </p> <p>Sabrina saw her mother and father quite often until she was six, when her grandmother died and she moved to Beverley's suburban Queenstown home. Unusually tall and big-boned, like the father she idolised, and inclined to imitate van Schoor's macho manners, Sabrina was never close to her mother. Beverley, who made porcelain dolls as a hobby and, according to her sister, would have preferred a petite, pretty daughter, was by now a respected businesswoman. Focusing her energies on making money, she spent little time with Sabrina. It was to the family's black maid, Gladys Nontombi, that Sabrina turned for comfort. Although she went to stay with Louis and his third wife occasionally, the visits were ended by Beverley after Louis stopped sending child-support cheques. </p> <p>Sabrina, an ungainly 11-year-old when her father was arrested in 1991, was among the first children to attend newly racially integrated state schools. While many whites in East London at the time of van Schoor's trial believed he was a scapegoat for apartheid, few realised that his daughter was also being punished for his sins at Queenstown Girls' High. \"Black kids began to tease me, calling my dad 'kaffir killer'. I used to cry and didn't want to go to school,\" she told me when I visited her in Fort Glamorgan prison. </p> <p>Nevertheless, Sabrina - who as a child preferred to play in Gladys's dingy maid's quarters in the back yard of the van Schoors' home, rather than in Beverley's luxurious bedroom - chose mainly mixed-race friends in the classroom. But once Beverley, a pillar of Queenstown's white community, realised that Sabrina's boyfriends were also likely to be black or \"coloured\" (mixed race), she kept the teenager a virtual prisoner to prevent her socialising across the colour divide. \"She was just doing exactly what Mr Mandela said - making friends with people of different colours,\" said one of Sabrina's supporters at her trial. </p> <p>According to Sabrina's court testimony, the people who befriended her were hardly ever whites. She said she was molested during her childhood on three occasions by white men, one of them a boyfriend of Beverley's. When she told her family about the sexual abuse, they laughed and accused her of lying. A \"coloured\" man listened, however. This marked the start of a double life that was incomprehensible to the whites of Queenstown, a get-rich-quick outpost on the edge of the barren rural region known as the \"homelands\", where apartheid had tried to confine the black majority. </p> <p>After Sabrina had left school, she went to work for her mother's estate agency. At 20, she became pregnant by a non-white boyfriend. Beverley was horrified and stepped up the persecution. Having always felt unloved by her mother, Sabrina was now shunned by her half-brothers, too. \"They called me to a meeting and told me it was my last chance to have an abortion,\" Sabrina recalled in prison. \"They said if I went ahead and had the baby, my child would never play with theirs.\" </p> <p>Quarrelling daily with her mother, Sabrina took to locking herself in her bedroom and poring over the old press clippings of her father's trial. These featured gruesome inquest photographs of her father pointing to the sites of some of his murders, but they were the only pictures Sabrina had of him. Having convinced herself that her father was just doing his job when he murdered so many people, she never lost hope that he would be a good father to her. </p> <p>Sabrina wanted to leave Beverley's house and set up home alone with her baby. But she worked for - and was financially dependent upon - her mother, who threatened to fire her if she left and to gain custody of the six-month-old child on the grounds of maternal neglect. According to the psychologist who wrote a criminal profile on Sabrina for the judge at her trial, she consulted a social worker to check what rights Beverley had over her baby. </p> <p>As the mother/daughter relationship continued to deteriorate, Sabrina approached a 24-year-old man with a criminal record, Feza Mdutshane, and offered him 100,000 rands (around \u00a38,500) to kill her mother. Three weeks later, according to her confession, Sabrina let Mdutshane into the house, early on the morning of March 22 2002, took her baby from her mother and waited in her room as the killer attacked Beverley with a bread knife. In Mdutshane's account, Sabrina's only comment after the murder was, \"Are you sure she's dead?\" He told the judge at his trial that Sabrina returned to the room where her mother lay, stood over the body and found Beverley's mobile under the bed by calling it from her own phone. </p> <p>The killing led to a great deal of heart-searching. There was no case on record of premeditated matricide, even in crime-ravaged South Africa. Did the daughter simply copy her father's cold-blooded methods of achieving his ends? Or were Sabrina's attempts to escape racism through violence a symptom of South Africa's deepest problems? </p> <p>In the summer of 2002, Sabrina began her 25-year sentence at Fort Glamorgan. Her father, who had been convicted of seven murders and two attempted murders, had served 10 years of his sentence and, as it would turn out, had only two more years before his release. </p> <p>At his trial, van Schoor had claimed self-defence, despite the fact that most of his victims were unarmed and some were shot in the back. The murderer had evaded arrest for more than three years because apartheid's police, magistrates and inquest judges turned a blind eye to his killings. Even now, on the eve of his release, van Schoor is held in awe by many white East Londoners, who continue to see him as the man who protected them against criminals 12 years ago. </p> <p>It was left to two young journalists, who were initially unable to convince even their editors of van Schoor's guilt, to stick to their story until the society that had created van Schoor and supported his murders was finally forced to confront him. </p> <p>Patrick Goodenough, 24, of the Daily Dispatch, thought the allegations against van Schoor too outlandish to be true when he first heard them in 1989. The story had come to him from a local estate agent, who had overheard a burglar alarm salesman extolling the talents of one of his company's security guards. Explaining that the alarm system he was selling went off without the knowledge of intruders inside the premises, the salesman had boasted, \"Louis van Schoor has killed or wounded up to 100 burglars.\" </p> <p>A few weeks later, Goodenough read a report that two suspected burglars had been shot dead by an unidentified factory security guard. The journalist called the owner of the premises where the shootings had occurred and asked for the guard's name: it was Louis van Schoor. He still did not know how much of the estate agent's story to believe, but Goodenough had established that van Schoor had killed two men, although this was not unusual in his line of work. </p> <p>Ten days later, the trial of two housebreaking suspects gave Goodenough further evidence of van Schoor's licence to kill. The state alleged that the two - Thanduxolo Tshana, 28, and Simpiwe Tom, 16 - had been caught breaking into a clothing shop. Tom testified that he had been asleep on the pavement outside a bakery when van Schoor woke him and offered him a job. He accepted and they drove down East London's Oxford Street to Budget Buys. Inside the store, Tom told the magistrate, the guard shot him in the chest. When he fell, van Schoor fired three more shots straight at him. </p> <p>Tshana told the court that he was on his way to work at a beach-front hotel when van Schoor suddenly came out of an alley and opened fire. He collapsed and the guard hauled him into the courtyard behind the building. When van Schoor disappeared, Tshana dragged himself into an outdoor toilet. On his return, van Schoor tried to kick down the door, and then fired two shots through it. </p> <p>Tom and Tshana protested their innocence, but the magistrate dismissed them as liars and sent them to prison. However, an encounter between a young woman reporter and van Schoor during the tea break shortly before sentencing left Goodenough in no doubt that he was on to an important story. The reporter, Sally Shaw, related how she had decided to act girlie when she spoke to van Schoor outside the court: \"Your job must be quite dangerous. You must have shot quite a few people,\" she ventured. </p> <p>\"Yes,\" answered van Schoor, revealing his arrogance. \"Off the record, it must be about 100 now.\" </p> <p>The following day, Goodenough combed through the Dispatch's crime reports and found three more violent incidents involving van Schoor. Intrigued, he rang the police media officer, who declined to confirm van Schoor's involvement, but asked, \"Why are you after this guy? He does a lot of good work.\" </p> <p>Unable to confirm that the former policeman had killed at least three people and wounded four more, Goodenough discussed his suspicions about van Schoor with several security officials around the country, all of whom agreed that it was unusual for a guard to shoot that often over a short period. The reporter then wrote a story expressing concern about a local security guard with too many notches on his gun belt. Included in his piece was the claim van Schoor had made to Shaw. The Dispatch's editors spiked it. </p> <p>The next suspicious pointer was a call to Goodenough from an agitated local resident. He said he was calling the Dispatch as a last resort after failing to get the police to allow his domestic worker, Grace Sipolo, into the mortuary to confirm whether or not an 18-year-old who had been shot dead two nights earlier at Mike's Tavern was her missing son. Goodenough again telephoned the police media officer, who confirmed that there had been a shooting at the beach-front restaurant in which a security guard had killed two people. The spokesman refused to name the guard. Goodenough immediately called the restaurant's security company and asked to speak to van Schoor. </p> <p>Van Schoor returned the call a few minutes later, sounding cheerful when he admitted his involvement, but telling the journalist that any further comment would have to come from the police. Goodenough called Cambridge Road police station to find out how he could gain entry to its mortuary. The duty officer told him that, because it was a public holiday, his request would have to wait. He then let slip the fact that three people had been shot at Mike's Tavern, not two, the third having been wounded. </p> <p>After work that evening, Goodenough went to Frere Hospital and searched the wards for a gunshot victim. He found Siyabonga Tom - who had been admitted on the night of the shooting at Mike's Tavern - wired to life support machines in the intensive-care unit, too ill to receive visitors. In the meantime, Grace Sipolo was finally admitted to the mortuary where she found her son, Steki, who had died from bullet wounds to the upper arm and chest. </p> <p>Goodenough eventually interviewed Siyabonga in a general ward. He and two friends, Steki Sipolo and a youth he knew only as Patrick, had been looking for food in rubbish bins outside Mike's Tavern. Patrick kept watch while Sipolo, who had found the back door unlocked, went into the kitchen. Suddenly, a gunshot rang out. The two ducked and scurried into hiding places. Siyabonga saw a tall white man with a long beard coming over the wall with a torch in one hand and a pistol in the other. </p> <p>Van Schoor found Sipolo hiding behind the fridge and dragged the screaming youth out by his leg. \"I apologise, my baas, please don't shoot me, rather call the police,\" Sipolo begged. Two shots rang out. Sipolo fell silent. Van Schoor swung round and saw Siyabonga inside a large rubbish bin, also begging not to be shot. The security guard grabbed him and shot him in the back at point-blank range. As he fell, Siyabonga saw van Schoor climbing back over the wall, speaking into his walkie-talkie. </p> <p>Goodenough was about to write a story based on his interview at Siyabonga's hospital bedside. He was interrupted by his news editor, who informed him that the youth had been charged with housebreaking. The case was now sub judice, meaning the newspaper could not report Siyabonga's claims until he repeated them in court. Frustrated and annoyed, the journalist decided to approach a human rights organisation, the Black Sash, for a lawyer to represent Siyabonga. </p> <p>The victims were piling up: at least five dead and seven wounded in the six weeks since Goodenough had embarked on his investigation. He tried again to get the story published, but his editors again spiked it. When Goodenough showed them the charges of attempted murder filed against van Schoor by the lawyer working with the Black Sash, they referred to the sub judice rule again. The next day, Goodenough wrote a brief factual report stating that police had confirmed that they were investigating two charges of attempted murder against a security guard named Sybrand \"Louis\" van Schoor. To his fury, even this bland story was rejected by his newspaper at a time when van Schoor was boasting on the phone to him: \"I'm in full production ... full production.\" </p> <p>A week later, Goodenough was tipped off by a court interpreter that van Schoor was about to appear before an inquest into the death of a child, Liefie Peters, who had been shot dead at the Esplanade Wimpy Bar in 1988. He rushed to the court to find that van Schoor had just left and the case had been postponed. In the inquest docket, he found a statement by a youth called John Swartbooi. The teenager said that he and Peters had broken into the Wimpy to steal money. After entering through a smashed window, they saw a white man answering van Schoor's description peering through the front window. They ran to hide in a toilet. Huddled together, barely breathing, they watched the huge figure loom through the broken glass, his greasy hair and wild beard visible in the dim glow of a street lamp. Then he spotted them and fired. Seven shots. Then van Schoor calmly radioed the police. </p> <p>Goodenough, knowing that six people had been killed and nine wounded by van Schoor, was losing patience with the Daily Dispatch - ironically the newspaper that had been hailed all over the world during the 1970s for fearlessly championing black consciousness activist Steve Biko. Goodenough approached a colleague, 21-year-old Dominic Jones, to help him discover if van Schoor had killed as many people as he claimed. \"There was only one way to find out,\" says Jones. \"I went to the courts and, after the usual stonewalling from officials, started going through the inquest files.\" Many hours later, he left with the names of 22 people who had been killed by van Schoor. \"The evidence of van Schoor's bloody reign had been there all the time, gathering dust,\" he says. \"It seemed incredible that so many were dead and yet no one had ever raised the alarm.\" </p> <p>When Jones gave him the list of inquest victims, Goodenough made a final attempt to publish details of van Schoor's murders in the Dispatch. His report was rejected. That weekend, the Natal-based Sunday Tribune ran the story on its front page, alongside dramatic pictures of van Schoor copied from the inquest files. </p> <p>The public had at last been informed of van Schoor's death patrols. Police officers nationwide were suddenly bombarded with outraged inquiries. The story sparked what police headquarters in Pretoria called \"a general polemic\". An opposition MP demanded to know from the minister of justice how it was possible for the inquest magistrates in East London summarily to close 35 cases in which one man had been implicated in each killing, without a single hearing taking place. </p> <p>Van Schoor's actions became the subject of intense public and media interest, both at home and abroad. Lawyers called for a revision of Section 49 of the Criminal Procedures Act which, in effect, permitted the killing of a child running away with a stolen apple. At a time when the police spokesman on the matter was still referring to van Schoor as \"just a bloody efficient security guard\", the disclosures put under the spotlight the criminal justice system and its attempts to protect van Schoor. </p> <p>The Black Sash's East London office was inundated with information, mainly from township dwellers relating near-death experiences with van Schoor, but also from doctors, policemen and members of the van Schoor family. A massive dossier began to accumulate against the killer who ran across roofs and entered dark buildings with his 9mm Parabellum clasped in both hands, and casually admitted in court documents that he had fired seven, eight, even 10 shots at a time. </p> <p>To everyone's surprise, van Schoor himself contributed to the dragnet that was closing in around him after he heard on the radio that investigators believed he had killed at least 34 people. At around midnight, three days after shooting dead his latest - and last - victim, van Schoor telephoned Jones to set the record straight. \"Number 39, pal,\" was all he said to the reporter. </p> <p>The public prosecutors who eventually prepared the case against van Schoor launched the biggest investigation the country had ever seen. But the criminal justice system, having colluded with van Schoor, had covered his tracks, so prosecutors found evidence to charge him with only 19 counts of murder and 21 of attempted murder. </p> <p>In April 1992, Mr Justice Lionel Melunsky found van Schoor guilty of seven murders and two attempted murders. Sentencing him to a total of 91 years - various sentences to run concurrently so that he was expected to serve at most 20 years - the judge said that van Schoor had been given the benefit of the doubt, even when the court was not convinced that he was telling the truth, and that he was lucky to get off so lightly. </p> <p>A model prisoner, according to his warders at Fort Glamorgan, van Schoor is coming out on parole after serving only 12 years. He owes his good fortune partly to a sentence reduction given to prisoners nationwide by then-president Nelson Mandela on his 80th birthday. Deflecting questions about his murders on East London's streets, he explains that he has found God in prison and is now a reformed character. </p> <p>The sense of physical power you get on meeting van Schoor is scary. He shakes hands with such force that you feel your teeth might chatter. He is imposing at 6ft 2in, and incongruously confident in the slightly ridiculous orange pyjama-like prison outfit. \"I have achieved everything I ever wanted to achieve in life,\" he says enigmatically. \"I have nothing left to prove.\" </p> <p>Brought to Sabrina's trial in shackles two years ago to assist in her defence, van Schoor chose instead to plead his own case for parole. He claimed he needed to be freed to look after Sabrina's baby while she was in prison serving at least two-thirds of her 25-year sentence. Sabrina spoke in support of her father's plea to adopt her daughter. She said that even if evidence were produced to prove that her father had assaulted her mother during their marriage, she would still be happy if he looked after her baby. \"I don't believe he would assault my child,\" Sabrina told the judge. \"She is his first grandchild.\" </p> <p>As van Schoor prepares for his release next week, one of his last tasks in prison may be to break the news to Sabrina that he plans to live in faraway Cape Town after he marries his fiancee, a lawyer, who will be his fifth wife. Although Sabrina has been permitted fortnightly visits from her father, she continues to believe that he intends to settle in East London in order to bring her daughter to visit her every week during the remainder of her sentence. </p> <p>Dressed in prison-issue denim with her hair in stylish braids, Sabrina says she is praying that her father will be able to adopt her child. Although the foster mother brings the pretty three-year-old to Fort Glamorgan to visit her biological mother from time to time, Sabrina says: \"I know [the child] is happy where she is, but she belongs with us. Family is family.\" </p> <p>It is unlikely that the state, which gained custody of the child after Sabrina's half-brothers rejected her baby, would allow van Schoor to adopt his \"coloured\" granddaughter, even if he could prove that he sincerely wished to do so. \"The idea is grotesque,\" says a social worker who does not want to be named. The little girl lives happily in an idyllic mountain hamlet not far from the sites of her grandfather's multiple murders and her mother's matricide. Adored by the foster mother she calls Mummy, the youngest van Schoor is growing up in a community that has embraced her as neither black nor white </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Heidi Holland is currently writing a book about Sabrina van Schoor's life.</p>",
  "<p>Whatever happened to Jack Tanner? That's a question that hasn't been answered or, indeed, asked in the 16 years since HBO, in a formative foray into original programming, came up with the notion of sending a fake politician to participate in the 1988 presidential election.</p> <p>The resulting series, <strong>Tanner 88</strong>, directed by <strong>Robert Altman</strong> and written by <strong>Garry Trudeau</strong>, was a brilliant, ground-breaking, funny and depressing chronicle of a decent, if befuddled Democrat attempting to stay afloat on the campaign trail at the end of the Reagan era. Criss-crossing the country in an orgy of handshaking and speechmaking, Tanner winds up a man adrift. Having made so many compromises on the trail of his party's nomination and having reinvented his personality so many times in the face of the flaw-hungry media, he no longer has a clear idea of who he is, what he stands for or even why he entered the race.</p> <p>Actor Michael Murphy, who played Tanner, was adept enough at portraying an unthreatening figure versed in affable small talk and empty promises that genuine combat-hardened campaign vets like Bob Dole and Pat Robertson took him for the real thing. Amid an ensemble of actors specialising in the throwaway conversational fragments that even the least erudite of viewers (ie: me) recognise as a hallmark of a Robert Altman production, Pamela Reed, as Tanner's ferocious campaign manager, and a 20-year-old <strong>Cynthia Nixon</strong>, as his overly emotional daughter, stood out. Scheduled smartly to coincide with the most contentious presidential election in living memory and also with Cynthia Nixon's proud emergence from the closet, <strong>Tanner On Tanner</strong> sends Altman, Trudeau, Murphy and company back on the campaign trail.</p> <p>This time the focus is on Cynthia Nixon's character, Alex, and her attempts to shoot a documentary on her dad and his legacy. As an impressionable, idealistic student, Alex Tanner was prone to split-second mood swings. As an adult, she's a minefield of unexploded emotions. In the first episode of Tanner On Tanner, she shows the rough cut of her documentary to an unimpressed audience. The lack of response causes her to burst into tears. Then an audience member stands up and tells her, \"You can't cry. There's no crying in independent film.\" It's Robert Redford!</p> <p>Inspired by Redford to shoot fresh footage, Alex heads for the Democratic National Convention and Tanner On Tanner turns into a mind-boggling meta-documentary. When Alex attempts to shoot an interview with Ron Reagan, she gets into a fight with John Kerry's daughter, Alexandra, a real-life film-maker playing herself as a film-maker attempting to interview Ron Reagan. When Alex attempts to get a few words with John Kerry, she's blocked by Pamela Reed, who's now playing Kerry's ferocious campaign manager. Meanwhile, everywhere Alex goes she's trailed by a young film-maker who's documenting her documentary and everywhere Alex goes she's greeted with waves and smiles and that's because the vast majority of the crowd at the DNC recognise her as Miranda from Sex And The City. Once again Michael Murphy, as Tanner, ambles through the chaos, commiserating with former colleagues about the horrors of the campaign trail.</p> <p>Forget The West Wing, forget the actual election, the Tanner saga is time-capsule TV. There's been an unexpected groundswell of opinion in America. Suddenly, <strong>William Shatner</strong> is being taken seriously for his role in <strong>Boston Legal</strong>. Spun off from <strong>The Practice</strong> as a vehicle for <strong>James Spader's</strong> oddball attorney, it's Shatner playing a one-time legal genius whose descent into eccentric self-parody is leavened by poignant moments of self-awareness, who's being hailed as the series' main attraction. Neither of the huge ham's two perennial trademarks - his toupee and his propensity... to... leave... a... pause... at... the... end... of.... every... word - are absent but the rest of the David E Kelley show is so beset with quirk and so lacking in anything that could be described as relatable human behaviour that Shatner comes across a great actor.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Tanner 88 is showing nightly on BBC4, 11pm</p>",
  "<p>In the English gentleman's traditional code of conduct, there are few worse offences than cheating. In 1891, a scandal about cheating at baccarat by a guest at a private house party resulted in a libel action at which the future King Edward VII had to appear in court as a witness, so seriously was the matter taken. </p> <p>Things have changed a bit since then. Cheating is no longer regarded in Britain with the same horror. Huge numbers of people now cheat to some extent, especially in their relations with the taxman. There wasn't even much indignation over the suggestion that President Bush might have been wired to a secret outside prompter during the first of his television debates with Senator John Kerry. </p> <p>Nevertheless, it was still something of a shock to read last week that Prince Harry had been accused of cheating by his former art mistress at Eton. For the British people still appear to hope (absurd though it may seem) that members of the royal family will set the country an example of old-fashioned gentlemanly conduct. </p> <p>Could a prince found guilty of cheating in an exam remain in the line of succession to the throne? I may be wrong, but I think that even now it would be rather difficult. </p> <p>The art teacher, Sarah Forsyth, 30, claimed to have helped the prince cheat in his AS-level art exam, for which he was awarded a B. Clearly no rocket scientist, the prince passed only one other A-level, getting a D in geography, so the B in art was crucial for his acceptance as a student at the Sandhurst Military Academy where he plans to train next year for an army career. </p> <p>Forsyth raised the matter of her help to the prince at a hearing by an industrial tribunal into a claim of unfair dismissal she had made against the school. The tribunal will decide on the substance of this claim next year, but in the mean-time it has rejected a demand by Eton's lawyers that the \"Harry issue\" be excluded from the case. </p> <p>It was \"impossible to put the genie back in the bottle\", decided the tribunal, though Eton maintains that its decision not to renew Forsyth's contract has nothing to do with her complicity in Harry's alleged cheating. Forsyth, on the other hand, said that pressure on her by the head of the art department, Ian Burke, to help Harry pass his exam was central to her submission that he, Burke, had harassed and discriminated against her. </p> <p>Well, I don't know. The whole squalid affair makes me feel incredibly old and out of touch, for there is practically nothing about it that makes any sense to me. Here are some of the questions that I find perplexing: </p> <p>Why did a school as illustrious and wealthy as Eton College hire, in Forsyth, an assistant art teacher with no teaching experience? How could any teacher, experienced or not, admit to having secretly tape-recorded a pupil for the purpose of entrapment without even the smallest feeling of guilt? </p> <p>How could any normal schoolboy, required to write explanatory notes for submission to the examiners with his paintings, be expected, in an unsupervised situation, not to seek help in doing so? If that's what Prince Harry did, how could anybody call it \"cheating\"? </p> <p>Why is \"art\" an A-level subject anyway? Prince Harry's paintings are quite decorative in a touchingly primitive kind of way - they look like aboriginal representations of crocodiles - but how could anybody know what grade to give them? </p> <p>Why was his acceptance by Sandhurst dependent upon his passing this ridiculous A-level? Since when has the ability to paint vague approximations of crocodiles been a necessary qualification for soldiering? It is amazing under these circumstances that we have an army at all. </p> <p>When I was at Eton half a century ago, the idea of taking an A-level in art would have seemed absurd, and I must admit that it still seems absurd to me today. The art master then was called Wilfrid Blunt - he was the gentlest of men whom I cannot imagine ever harassing anybody or encouraging any boy to cheat. (His brother, however, was Sir Anthony Blunt, the famous traitor, so I suppose there must have been a propensity for deception in the Blunt genes.) </p> <p>Anyway, this case neatly encapsulates some of the least attractive aspects of contemporary life: the victim culture, the celebrity culture and the culture of greed (Forsyth is asking for money). It is tough on Prince Harry that he should be caught up in it.</p>",
  "When weblogs first sprang up, they tended to be whimsical \"online diaries\" or pages that recommended interesting sites to visit on the net. <p>Now bloggers have become weapons in the American presidential election battle. </p> <p>Since the campaign got under way their readership has grown enormously and the tone of their output has changed dramatically. </p> <p>Edward Morrissey, who runs the pro-Bush <a href=\"http://www.captainsquartersblog.com/mt/\">Captain's Quarters</a> - by no means the largest - is now logging 840,000 visits a month (up from 30,000 in January) to his daily Democrat-bashing. </p> <p>Recent entries include the latest theft or defacement of a Bush campaign sign and the lyrics of a satirical song about John Kerry, Mekong Delta Blues, written by contacts in Minneapolis: \"When I was first elected / My daddy told me son, / You gotta raise their taxes / And take away their guns.\" </p> <p>Mr Morrissey argues that the lack of a British-style national press in the United States catering for readers across the political spectrum creates a natural audience for blogs. </p> <p>He said: \"American voters live primarily in cities and suburbs with easy access to only one print newspaper. They get only one point of view.\" </p> <p>Interest in an ideological rival, the pro-Kerry <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/\">Daily Kos </a>, has leapt from 40,000 visits a day to 800,000 in the past year. </p> <p>Markos Moulitsas, the man behind it, argues that blogs serve multiple roles in the election - as media watchdogs, centres for activism and fundraisers. </p> <p>He is one of several bloggers who banded together in an effort to persuade readers to lobby advertisers on TV stations affiliated to the Sinclair Broadcast Group about its plans to screen a documentary linking Mr Kerry's anti-Vietnam campaign to the torture of captured US soldiers. </p> <p>Rightwingers replied with a blog mobilisation of their own urging the advertisers to stand firm. </p> <p>Part of this development is due to the Howard Dean effect. The former Vermont governor's campaign for the Democratic nomination was propelled by activist bloggers, and he quickly realised that a large number of small internet donations could be as valuable as those raised by setpiece events. </p> <p>These days many bloggers spend much of their time dissecting and analysing quotations and news reports in support of a favoured candidate. The pro-Kerry <a href=\"http://www.electablog.com/\">Electablog</a> made a great deal of an admission by the TV evangelist Pat Robertson that George Bush had told him before the war there would be no US casualties in Iraq. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.blogsforbush.com/\">Blogs for Bush</a> was delighted when the retired general Tommy Franks appeared to refute Mr Kerry's claim that Osama bin Laden had been let off the hook at Tora Bora. The pro-Bush <a href=\"http://www.littlegreenfootballs.com/weblog/weblog.php\">Little Green Footballs</a>, meanwhile, has mocked Mr Kerry's running mate, John Edwards, as a \"silky pony\" for his shiny hair, and called Teresa Heinz Kerry a \"billionairehead\". </p> <p>Not all are so partisan. Andrew Sullivan's <a href=\"http://www.andrewsullivan.com/\">Daily Dish</a>, which is logging an average of 3m visits a month, is yet to endorse a candidate. </p> <p>He enjoys the freedom, saying: \"I don't think a leftwing mag would have tolerated my pro-war enthusiasm a year ago, and a rightwing mag wouldn't tolerate my disillusionment today.\"</p>",
  "Cleo Toris leads me on stage to the tune of \"I am a woman\" and clasps my hand to her fake breast. \"They tell me you're married,\" she says. \"But are you curious?\" <p>\"Curious about what?\" I ask. \"I'll talk to you later,\" said Cleo Toris (run the two names together quickly) to the laughter of the mainly gay and lesbian crowd at the Black Tie Affair in Springfield, Missouri. </p> <p>With a proud crop of manly chest hair poking out of her pink harem outfit, Cleo Toris is no regular drag queen. </p> <p>But then this is just the biannual turn of raucous stand-up she does for charity. </p> <p>The rest of the year she is Mark Gideon, a 47-year-old education administrator. </p> <p>Mr Gideon is the only graduate of the Evangel University, a devout Christian college situated in Springfield (population 151,580), to be crowned Ms Missouri by the International Gay Rodeo Association. \"I got wonderful training at Evangel,\" he says. \"But I was shocked the first time I went into a gay bar and found half my Bible class was in there.\" There are around 71 Springfields (not including the one the Simpsons live in) dotted around 36 states and territories of America, from the Virgin Islands of the Caribbean to Vermont in New England. Georgia alone has nine; Virginia has eight. </p> <p>But the Springfield in Missouri is special. It is the home town of fundamentalist attorney general John Ashcroft, a man so religious he holds daily Bible study classes in his office and so prudish he ordered the naked breast of a statue in the justice department be covered. It is also the headquarters of the Assemblies of God Church - Mr Ashcroft's church - whose base is locally referred to as the Blue Vatican. </p> <p>But it is also home to a thriving, resilient and somewhat embattled, lesbian and gay community, with five gay bars, a gay theatre, and a community centre. Up in the surrounding Ozark mountains are several lesbian collectives that nestle alongside hippy communes and militia camps, said to \"get on because they leave each other alone\". The Black Tie Affair raised money for three lesbian and gay organisations and an Aids project. \"It's changed a lot since I came out in the 70s,\" says Mr Gideon. \"Back then it was just bars and the park. Now we're better organised.\" </p> <p>A year ago the climate looked encouraging. The supreme court had recently repealed the sodomy laws, finally making gay lifestyles legal. A few months later Massachusetts became the first state to make same sex marriage legal. Then came the backlash. Missouri passed an amendment to its constitution effectively outlawing gay marriage by a huge margin of 71% to 29%. </p> <p>President George Bush is vowing to amend the federal constitution to do the same if elected; his challenger, John Kerry is opposed to gay marriage but argues it should be left to the states. In this election year gays and lesbians in general and gay marriage in particular have become a central issue. It is the means by which Republicans hope to mobilise their fundamentalist base on election day and the subject Democrats wish would just go away. </p> <p>In 11 states, including the battlegrounds of Arkansas, Michigan, Ohio and Oregon, the presidential election is twinned with a referendum on amending the constitution to outlaw gay marriage. And polls suggest all of them are likely to pass. \"It's just about the perfect wedge issue,\" says Jeff Wunrow, executive director of the Missouri-based lesbian and gay rights organisation, Promo. \"It galvanises Republicans and splits some of the Democratic base.\" </p> <p>The day after Missouri's constitutional amendment passed, Melissa Marles was wary when she went into work, where she is \"out\" to just a few people. \"I didn't know what I would hear and I knew I was going to have to stifle my feelings. I thought 'This many people thought it was okay to do that'. I was a little uncomfortable.\" </p> <p>When Stephen Adams, a doctor in Springfield, heard the results of the constitutional amendment in Missouri, he was \"ready to move\". But his partner, Randy Doennig, took heart from the way the gay community stood up to the attack. </p> <p>\"We went door to door campaigning,\" says Mr Doennig, president of Promo. \"That's the first time we had gone door to door about anything; the first time we were engaged on a local level and we had to talk about gay marriage. They don't take us seriously because we haven't asked them to take us seriously.\" </p> <p>Mr Doennig points out that the vote in the areas where they canvassed was much closer. \"Our neighbours and people that we talked to voted for us,\" he says. \"If we all run away and go somewhere else then who changes this place? It just needs a shove.\" </p> <p>When you move from Iowa to Missouri you cross the Mason-Dixon line into hybridity; a racial, cultural and historical blur that blends the Midwest with the upper South. This is Mark Twain country - a former slave-owning state that the slave-owners failed to win over during the civil war. The deeper you journey into it the more languorous the drawl and the more plentiful the churches. </p> <p>Long before you get to Springfield, Missouri is pronounced Missurah. In 2000 Mr Bush won Missouri by 50% to 47% and this year it was slated as one of the original 17 key battleground states. </p> <p>But as the race draws to a close the campaigns are cutting their losses in areas they think they cannot win and concentrating their resources in those where they have more chance. Mr Bush, for example, has all but given up on Michigan; and Mr Kerry has given up in Missouri, where Republicans now hold a six-point lead. </p> <p>Mr Kerry's message about jobs and healthcare and Iraq could not penetrate the touch button \"value\" issues of abortion, guns and gays in a state where 36% of voters are evangelical Christians. </p> <p>\"I think it's a mistake,\" says Dave Robertson, a political scientist at the University of Missouri in St Louis. \"I think the election will be close and whoever loses will probably have lost Missouri and regret not doing more to get it.\" </p> <p>Back in Springfield, Phil from Chicago heads to the gay bars with an armful of Kerry stickers, determined not to abandon the state just yet. \"People are so short-sighted,\" he says. \"They can vote against abortion but there'll still be abortions. They can vote against gays but there'll still be gays.\" </p> <p>At the Black Tie Affair, a photographic exhibition illustrates that there has always been a gay community in Springfield, even if the rest of the community was not aware of it. A grainy picture of four men dancing next to an old radio was submitted by a woman who said she knew her \"uncle was a little different\". Then there is a shot of Rick in his army uniform during the 70s with the caption: \"They didn't ask and he didn't tell.\" And there is a younger Cleo Toris, when she sang with the Mexican Villa Girls. </p> <p>But the accompanying text shows that when they have put their heads above the parapet there have been mixed results. </p> <p>In 1989, when Springfield's South West Missouri University put on The Normal Heart, a gay-themed play about Aids by Larry Kramer, one of the men who promoted it had his house burned down. Now the Vandivort theatre in the centre of town is showing Bent, a play about Nazi persecution of homosexuals. </p> <p>Springfield has no gay pride parade because the town has not outlawed discrimination in the workplace for lesbian and gay men, says Mr Doennig. \"A lot of people are worried about being fired.\" </p> <p>But last year the town did see an eight-fold increase in membership to Promo. \"We've only been tolerated because we've remained silent,\" agrees Mr Adams. \"But we just can't be silent anymore.\"</p>",
  "The Bush campaign played the fear card in graphic style yesterday with an advertisement showing wolves gathering in a dark forest, ready to take advantage of John Kerry's alleged weakness on national security. <p>The \"wolves\" broadcast is intended to leave a powerful image in voters' minds in the last 10 days of a tight campaign, as opinion polls continue to differ about who is ahead. </p> <p>The fear factor is likely to dominate the race in its final stage. The Kerry campaign has argued that Bush policies will lead to the reintroduction of military conscription, while President George Bush's team has repeatedly claimed that a Kerry presidency would leave the United States at the mercy of its enemies. </p> <p>Yesterday Mr Bush told a crowd of supporters in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania: \"The [election] outcome will set the direction for the war on terror, and in that war there is no room for confusion.\" </p> <p>The new Republican advertisement aims to drive that message home in a more visceral way. </p> <p>It shows wolves prowling in a forest and gathering in a clearing as the narrator tells voters that Mr Kerry \"and the liberals in Congress\" had voted to cut intelligence spending by $6bn (\u00a33.3bn) in 1994 - the year after the first World Trade Centre bombing. </p> <p>The cuts \"would have weakened America's defences. And weakness attracts those who are waiting to do America harm\", it concludes as the wolf pack begins moving menacingly towards the camera. </p> <p>The Kerry campaign struck back within minutes of the broadcast's release, pointing out that Porter Goss, the man Mr Bush has made CIA director, called for bigger intelligence cuts as a Republican congressman. It also accused the White House of cutting an FBI request for counter-terrorist funding after the September 11 attacks. </p> <p>Mr Kerry's running mate, John Edwards, denounced the advertisement as \"despicable and contemptible\". </p> <p>\"They have stooped so low now they are using a pack of wolves running around a forest trying to scare you; trying to scare the American people,\" he told a rally in Florida. </p> <p>Appeals to voters' fears with the help of graphic allegories have an effective record in US electoral politics. </p> <p>The \"wolves\" film is reminiscent of Ronald Reagan's advertisement in 1984 called The Bear, in which a menacing grizzly - symbolising a Soviet threat - is seen stalking in the woods. It helped frame the debate in favour of Mr Reagan's military build-up. </p> <p>\"Allegories can be very powerful,\" Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Centre, said. </p> <p>\"They tend to create political talk, which is framed in a way that usually benefits the candidate who makes the ad. </p> <p>\"People are more prone to talk about it because it's not straightforward.\" </p> <p>The Washington Post tracking poll continued to show Mr Bush ahead, but a new AP/Ipsos poll gave Mr Kerry a 49%-46% edge. </p> <p>Mr Kerry received another boost when the rival candidate for the progressive vote, Ralph Nader, lost a legal attempt to get on the ballot in the key swing state of Ohio. </p> <p>The pollsters generally agree, however, that the Democrats have lost some of their traditional advantage with women. </p> <p>In 2000 Al Gore won the female vote by 11 points over Mr Bush, but Mr Kerry's appeal to women has been less assured, particularly with the \"security moms\", whose main concern is keeping their families safe from terrorism. </p> <p>Aware that more than 60% of the remaining undecided voters are women, Mr Kerry devoted his main campaign appearance yesterday, in Milwaukee, to a speech on issues affecting working women, promising to raise the minimum wage and improve access to healthcare. </p> <p>He said: \"Today, for far too many women, the American dream seems a million miles away, because when you've barely got time to sleep - who's got time to dream?\" </p> <p>As the campaign approaches its last full week, Mr Kerry is focusing his efforts on south-western states today, and will make a speech tomorrow on faith in an attempt to attract undecided religious voters. </p> <p>The president, meanwhile, has surprised some of his supporters by deciding to take a rest, withdrawing to his ranch in Crawford, Texas, for the weekend.</p>",
  "<p>It was no surprise that two people in Fanelli's Bar and Grill were reading Philip Roth's new novel, The Plot Against America. Fanelli's is the left epicentre of Soho, a manufacturing district in lower Manhattan that became home to artists and galleries in the 1970s and now is filled with Euro-shoppers. Tourists avoid Fanelli's - grimy, badly lit, air-conditioned down almost to absolute zero - leaving in peace the elderly union organisers, greying sculptors and the odd younger family feeding enormous Italian meatballs to children in prams. </p> <p>Roth's novel, a fantasy of fascism overwhelming America at the beginning of the second world war, is a story that people in my local worry might become fact. In Roth's novel, the charming, empty-headed airman Charles Lindbergh comes to power in 1940, manipulated by a vicious vice-president. The outside world frightened Americans; domestic purges of Jewish-Communist-terrorists reassured them. The novel has a pedigree; in the 1930s Nathaniel West wrote A Cool Million and Sinclair Lewis It Can't Happen Here , both horror stories of Americans embracing right-wing despots out of innocence and fear. Like his ancestors, Roth is far too gifted to write a piece of crude agit-prop. He relies on the news to make the modern connections for him. </p> <p>My first day back from London, labouring over a Fanelli cheeseburger cooked to the consistency of leather, the television was tuned to a discussion of the Patriot Act. </p> <p>In its first version, passed shortly after the terrorist destruction of the World Trade Centre in 2001, the act gave the government new surveillance powers (called \"data mining\") over individual citizens, while cloaking the government's own operations in greater secrecy. Patriot Act II, a draft of which was first leaked in February 2003, proposed to go much further. For instance, US citizens could be stripped of their citizenship if the government believed they belonged to a terrorist organisation; this would be purely an administrative decision, as would be the deportation of non-nationals who threaten America's \"national defence, foreign policy, or economic interests\", in the words of the draft. </p> <p>In the bar, people watched in stunned silence a dispassionate, juridical discussion of these proposals on the tube, occasionally glancing through the dirty windows to the crowd surging outside, who seemed somewhere else, far away. The scene in the bar sums up my strongest impression, in the weeks since I've returned, of the American intelligentsia - an honourable word here. Bushism has made intellectuals afraid of their own country. </p> <p>Four blocks from Fanelli's, the cartoonist Art Spiegelman presented his new book In the Shadow of No Towers a few weeks ago at the Cooper Union, New York's version of Toynbee Hall. At first no establishment publisher would touch this story in pictures of how Spiegelman's family lived through the attack of September 11 and its aftermath; he was too \"political\" in asserting the bombing had been high-jacked by politicians. At Cooper Union, the street-smart, chain-smoking Spiegelman reliably provoked laughter as he jibed at President George W Bush, silence when he compared the scenes in his new book with those of Maus, his comic-strip novel about Nazis. Had he gone too far? Spiegelman kept going. He turned the knife by remarking that the only Americans who were not afraid now were the New Yorkers who lived through the attack. The knife twist reminded me of a question put to me last Christmas by a British soldier: how long would Americans have endured the Blitz? </p> <p>\"Fascism\" is both a strong and an opaque word. Discussions here about whether America is threatened by fascism have been focused this autumn by the appearance of Robert Paxton's The Anatomy of Fascism. An historian of Vichy France at Columbia University, Paxton calmly explores rather than rants about fascism as \"democracy gone wrong\" in Europe from 1919 to 1939. Yet its final chapter has roused debate because Paxton argues that democracy can go wrong whenever far-right beliefs intersect with conservative economic and political institutions, and that the longing for an iron grip is much more than historical accident. Light references to Israel and the United States evince Paxton's prudence yet his readers have not taken these suggestions lightly. </p> <p>We could think of fascism itself as either hard or soft. Hard fascism rams home to the citizen that he or she is held in that iron grip, as in Mussolini's theatre of force or George Orwell's nightmare Nineteen Eighty-four. Soft fascism is not so much a velvet glove as an invisible hand, the operations of control hidden from scrutiny as Patriot Act II, and more, internal repression presented to the public as merely preventive action against threats that have yet to materialise. The Bush administration acted in this preventive way, for instance, by shutting three of the larger Muslim charities in America, not for anything they had done, but for what might happen, some time, somewhere. In hard fascism the state exploits concrete fear, in soft fascism the state exploits diffuse anxiety. </p> <p>\"Security\" takes on a peculiar meaning in soft fascism. Perhaps the most disturbing book to appear this year, Jeffrey Rosen's The Naked Crowd, illuminates the twisted experience of security. In Rosen's view, reality TV and its like have made invasion of privacy into popular entertainment. The pleasure of stripping away privacy fits into an economy where high-tech firms such as Oracle make large profits from developing personal data bases, listening devices, and auditing software for business. Government destruction of private rights thus become \"naturalised\": the public already enjoys the act of stripping people naked, and this intrusion is just an extension of how business gets done in the computer age. </p> <p>Diffuse anxieties only add further fuel to this \"naturalised\" process. Insecurity about what might happen, some time, somewhere, becomes an ongoing state of mind; it co-habits with preventive measures, but these draconian measures do not erase unease. Indeed, as the state machine acts stealthily to prevent things happening, as its technologies become built into the fabric of everyday business practice, there can be no defining moment when an ordinary citizen could declare, \"now I am more secure\". </p> <p>Is America menaced by soft fascism, as many intellectuals fear? As the autumn has progressed, the iron grip of Bushism has loosened, due to the regime's practical failures abroad. To his credit, Senator John Kerry has recognised something more is at stake; though chastised by the left as weak, the language he speaks aims to be reassuring. Even if Bush is voted out, though, the half of the nation for which he speaks will not lose its anxiety. The answer to my question lies in the domestic circumstances of America for which terrorism has become a talisman of unease at home. </p> <p>It's become a journalistic cliche to divide America into red and blue states. The red states: southern and western, Republican, godly, abortion, gay and feminist unfriendly, militaristic. The blue states: eastern or coastal, Democratic, secular, identity-friendly, diplomatic. The country thus appears divided exactly in half. What these clich\u00e9s don't get at is something red and blue share, America's confused, fear-inducing experience of class. </p> <p>In a book that has come into its own this autumn, What's the Matter with Kansas?, Thomas Frank ponders how poor people in that heartland state, threatened with loss of work, lack of health insurance, or mounting family debt, address these woes. Preventing abortion or gay marriage seems some sort of solution; economics gets translated into culture. Like the retired union organisers in Fanelli's who yearn for the working-class politics of New York in the years after the Great Depression, Frank invokes \"false consciousness\" to explain what's happening now. </p> <p>Translating economic into cultural insecurity is nothing new. Nearly 40 years ago, when we researched The Hidden Injuries of Class , Jonathan Cobb and I found white workers in Boston blaming drop-out hippies and black ghetto culture for their own, unrelated labour and communal problems. And as an ideal, the cultural conservatism of the working classes idea stretches back into the 19th century and across the ocean, as in Disraeli's famous image of \"angels in marble\", the working classes whose everyday solidity awaits the sculpting hand of conservative leadership. </p> <p>What is new is the class map. Ironically, the British conservative Ferdinand Mount has drawn it in his new book, Mind the Gap. In the last generation, large numbers of people have come to feel excluded from the \"skills society\" or \"meritocracy\" of Blair's Britain and Clinton's America. These are people whose beliefs in self-discipline, hard work and family sacrifice do not yield much control over their own lives. As Mount points out, they feel left out and treated by the more agile with - at best - indifference. At Spiegelman's talk, he got a good laugh by saying he didn't know anybody in the American heartland. </p> <p>Loss of control is an economic fact, but a subtle one. More than in Britain, the wealth of America's middle classes has stagnated as the upper 10th has dramatically improved. To counter this stagnation, the middle class has taken on consumer debt it can barely manage, as Robert Manning has recently documented in Credit Card Nation. People have tried to spend their way into status, and now the bills are coming due, as personal bankruptcies have taken off. </p> <p>The same loss of control appears, famously, in the shrinking number of jobs. The familiar villain is outsourcing of work to Mexico, China or India, but the familiar villain misleads. Auto-mation has finally arrived in America, shrinking white-collar service jobs and manufacturing alike. In the past 20 years, for instance, the US steel industry increased its productivity by four per cent while cutting its labour force from about 212,000 to 79,000 - a transformation due mostly to automation. Again, young people now leaving university find themselves offered jobs that formerly went to secondary-school graduates. As in Britain, low-wage immigrants in America flourish in the cracks of the formal economy, but their children and grandchildren increasingly do not. </p> <p>Is it \"false consciousness\" to counter these changes by prohibiting abortion or gay marriage? Translating economics into culture is both irrational and logical. In the wealthiest country on Earth, the economic engine rouses Ricardo's ancient spectre of uselessness; the class map is shrinking the number of people who matter, who are included. The new class map breeds fear, and the counter to fear is to assert that the old values matter. By shifting the centre of gravity, you assert your own value when confronted with conditions you can do nothing about. </p> <p>How this translation works is exemplified by perhaps the most controversial book to appear in America this season, Samuel Huntington's Who are We? He is well known to Brits for his previous book, The Clash of Civilizations , which argued an inevitable global conflict between Islam and the west; this new book minia turises the same argument within America. Now Mexicans appear as local Muslims, an alien, unmelting presence refusing to play by American rules. The book is less remarkable for its ethnic prejudices than for its invocation of \"traditional\" American values, wrapped up in a Protestant non-conformist, small-town, package; Huntington proudly asserts he is \"anti-cosmopolitan\", world-travelled Harvard professor that he is. Though most Mexican immigrants happen to live in abject poverty, that is not the point; he is \"defending America\". </p> <p>This is indeed an apology for soft fascism. Fearful of the present, the outside, the alien, the defender of America looks backward to a mythical golden age in Puritan New England. But now the white anglo-saxon Protestant is armoured with a computer. The culture of soft fascism cannot be reduced to the traditional bogeymen of the American left: even in its liberal years, the United States was an ardently religious country; Americans were ardent nationalists even when they fought for Europe in the two world wars. Nor is the appeal of soft fascism to be treated with simple contempt. The terror attack tripped a domestic switch about experiences of marginality that people have trouble naming and about which they can do little. Abroad, Bushism registers a wounded national honour; at home, confusion about living honourably. </p> <p>In the years I've lived in London, I've often been asked why American intellectuals were so slow to respond to the threats of soft fascism. In a way this criticism is unfair; while the New York Times temporarily lost its nerve, the New York Review of Books didn't. It's certainly true that individuals like Susan Sontag were attacked for being disloyal for saying things about American imperialism that are commonplace in London. (She also didn't lose her nerve.) And until this year - and perhaps too late - policy-makers and thinkers in the Democratic party were on the defensive. </p> <p>A kind of archaic residue from the McCarthy era is one explanation. Though most 20th-century wars were fought under Democratic presidents, liberals have had to prove their patriotism as conservatives have not. But the denizens of my local - myself included - provide more of an answer. </p> <p>For a long time the American intellectual left has been out of touch with the American people. It has spoken in the name of the people but not to them. Now, in the reconfigured landscape of economics, class and culture, however, the educated, cosmopolitan liberal is a social victor. Even the sculptor in Fanelli's struggling to make ends meet is a social victor; nobody can rob him of his work and worth. </p> <p>The right has perhaps understood that victory better than the victors themselves, in giving fresh life to the taunts of \"cultural elitism\" aimed at the intellectual left. The attack embodies a classic dilemma: when a young man with a good degree and an expensive lap-top attacks injustice, the ordinary person feels patronised. </p> <p>For the past four years, the rich and powerful in America have capitalised on just this social distance, between the cultural elite and people beset by anxieties about personal insufficiency and mutual respect. The victors have defended themselves by saying, but we are just like you, loyal Americans; the defence rings false because they aren't domestically the same. Those bewildered glances out of Fanelli's window, the knowing sniggers at Cooper Union, are signs of an inequality as ambiguous as the word \"American\". </p> <p>The books I've touched on evoke what could happen as a result of the anxieties besetting the country now, their exploitation on the right, and indifference, bewilderment, or paternalism on the left. The solution to soft fascism may, however, lie far beyond party politics. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Richard Sennett teaches sociology at the London School of Economics.
