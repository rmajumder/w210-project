  "For more than a week the Guardian has been under an unprecedented email bombardment from the United States. The stimulus was an exercise mounted by G2, the tabloid second section of the paper, to put individual voters of undeclared party allegiance in the presidential election in Clark County, Ohio - narrowly balanced between Republicans and Democrats - in touch with individual Guardian readers. <p>The latter were urged to write \"citizen to citizen, explaining why this election matters to you, and which issues you think ought to matter to the US electorate\". The principle followed had earlier been expounded in a comment piece, under the heading \"US policy now affects every citizen on the planet. So we should all have a say in who gets to the White House\". </p> <p>Although the G2 article did not presume to say which way it wanted the unaffiliated citizens of Clark County to vote, the front page of the main broadsheet that day carried the open declaration: \"What you can do to beat Bush - with a little help from the folks in Ohio.\" </p> <p>To facilitate its campaign, the Guardian obtained, on payment of a fee of $25 (\u00a314), a copy of the file of voters for Clark County. It extracted from the 85,000 names on it the 36,000 with undeclared affiliation. It then arranged, through a special website, to provide readers with the address of an individual resident of Clark County. </p> <p>The features editor of the Guardian, in a piece in G2 on Thursday, explained that in the few days that the site operated before it was hacked into and disabled, the Guardian had sent out the names of more than 14,000 Clark County voters. </p> <p>By my calculations well over 5,000 emails, predominantly condemnatory of the exercise, had been poured into various Guardian queues by the middle of this week. Emails received by individual journalists accounted for about 3,000 of those. </p> <p>On Monday G2 carried an unexpurgated selection of the correspondence under the restrained heading (considering the invective): Dear Limey assholes. The selection was thinly sprinkled with letters praising the venture. The aggressively abusive letters prompted more than 90 from Americans apologising for their compatriots. </p> <p>The majority of emails received up to Thursday, whether from supporters of George Bush or John Kerry, were critical (only about 1 in 10 voiced support). It was clear that a \"spamming\" campaign was involved. One Guardian journalist, with dual American and British nationality - a strong supporter of the exercise - believed the reaction illustrated the intimidatory tactics of the angry right. The response of Democrats, fearing that their cause would be harmed, showed that the intimidation worked. The intention was to smother free speech. The G2 exercise sought to open up debate. </p> <p>Having read through many of the emails, and while acknowledging the letters of thanks and support among them, my own view is that the paper in carrying out the exercise through the intrusive use of the voters' list, has prejudiced some of the goodwill it has built up in America and unnecessarily excited its enemies. It has sought to intervene in the US election, with unpredictable consequences. </p> <p>In a poll I conducted among Guardian staff who had been following the story, of 71 respondents, 13 thought it a legitimate and worthwhile exercise, 14 were undecided and 44 were against it. Among the reasons given by the latter, reflecting complaints coming from the US, were that intervention in the democratic processes of another country was not \"legitimate newspaper behaviour\"; and that it was arrogant and self-aggrandising. </p> <p>Several were dismayed that the internet effect had apparently not been anticipated, one saying that the speed with which links to the Guardian story spread showed that \"this perceived insult has legs\". Another commented: \"It seems a shame that, in this interactive age, with email and weblogs all around, we rejected any attempt to have a real conversation with US voters.\" Several mentioned that the buoyant and jaunty nature of G2 journalism, marking a cultural distinction from the broadsheet, was not apparent on the website. </p> <p>The editor of the Guardian, defending the exercise, said it was a crucially important election in the face of which many felt a sense of impotence. \"What we did was simply to invite personal acts of communication from one individual to another. Most of the letters sent by Guardian readers, those I have seen, have been responsible and heartfelt.\" </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b>Readers may contact the office of the readers' editor by telephoning 0845 451 9589 (UK only, calls charged at local rate) or +44 (0)20 7713 4736 between 11am and 5pm UK time Monday to Friday excluding UK bank holidays.

  "No one knows exactly how Iran will react to the latest European proposals for reining in its nuclear ambitions and no one should underestimate the importance of its response. Britain, France and Germany - the EU3 - did the sensible thing yesterday when they set out their stall in Vienna. Their tempting idea is that the Islamic Republic will be helped to generate nuclear power if it agrees to stop enriching uranium, which can be used to make nuclear weapons. The United States is unhappy with this strategy of inducements. But with the American presidential election imminent and the Europeans desperately conscious of the shadow of Iraq, it is right to explore every diplomatic avenue. If there is no progress, the International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN's nuclear watchdog, will pass the dossier to the security council next month to consider \"further steps\", including the possible imposition of economic sanctions. It is hard to imagine that there will be a united international response at that point. <p>Iran maintains that its nuclear programme, a symbol of modernity and national pride, is for power generation and not for military purposes. It insists too that it is open to talks, but will never give up uranium enrichment - a process which can be used to produce fuel for nuclear reactors or material for atomic bombs. This is a murky area - though the US and Britain must be aware that their record on intelligence about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction will not inspire confidence that they are well informed about Iran. The studiously neutral IAEA has uncovered previously hidden activities that could well be related to a clandestine Iranian weapons programme. Crucially, though, it has found no \"smoking gun\". </p> <p>President George Bush famously included Iran in his \"axis of evil\" in the state of the union address in 2002, citing its support for the Lebanese Hizbullah and Palestinian Islamic Jihad groups, as well as its nuclear ambitions and a fundamentalist regime which began life by overthrowing the Shah and humiliating America back in 1979. But the view from Tehran looks fairly ominous these days: two of Iran's neighbours - Russia and Pakistan - are nuclear powers. Israel has a formidable if undeclared nuclear arsenal and has hinted heavily that it might launch a pre-emptive strike on Iran's nuclear facilities, as it did against Saddam Hussein's French-built reactor in 1981. American forces are next door in Iraq and Afghanistan - hardly a recipe for studied calm among the hawks around President Ali Khamenei. You do not need a Farsi edition of Clausewitz to work out that a nuclear weapon might be a useful protection against efforts at regime change in Tehran - a thought surely reflected in Wednesday's launch of a new long-range ballistic missile. </p> <p>Looking back a year or so ago, Iran looked like the case that could prove that European policies of engagement and persuasion would succeed where American sabre-rattling failed. The EU's strategic doctrine placed heavy emphasis on \"effective multilateralism\" (without referring to Mr Bush's disastrous unilateralism). The mission was important enough to unite London, Paris and Berlin, divided over Iraq, to try their luck with Iran. But barring some last minute surprise from Tehran, they seem to have failed. Understandably enough, the world is deeply preoccupied with Iraq, but the crisis brewing next door could be extremely serious. Nothing much will happen this side of November 2, though after that - especially with a re-elected President Bush - all bets will be off. The nuclear non-proliferation treaty has already been rocked by India and Pakistan acquiring nuclear weapons. Another breach could kill it off. That means that keeping the Iranian genie inside its bottle is a matter of global importance.</p>",
  "Roadworks slow progress along the strip in Las Vegas. In the distance, poking between the mock Eiffel Tower and the mock pyramid at Luxor, cranes stand out against the autumn sky, building the next phase of America's seemingly permanent boom town. <p>But 95 miles north-east of this city, the powerhouse of Nevada with 36 million visitors a year, lies another construction site. </p> <p>Yucca Mountain, projected to cost around $60bn (\u00a332.8bn), has been chosen by the Bush administration to be the nation's nuclear waste repository, set to hold the existing 40,000 tons of waste produced to date by the country's nuclear power stations. </p> <p>\"This material is the deadliest substance known to mankind,\" said Peggy Maze Johnson, executive director of Citizen Alert, a local group that has campaigned against the repository. \"It's one million times more radioactive when it comes out of the reactor core than when it went in.\" </p> <p>In February 2002, just over a year after taking office, President Bush recommended the Yucca Mountain site to Congress. But many voters remembered that, as a candidate in September 2000, Mr Bush promised not to approve the site until it had been \"deemed scientifically safe\", a formulation that is credited with helping him win the state. </p> <p>Four years on, and with the project stalled by legal challenges to its scientific justification, those words may come back to haunt the president in what has become a swing state. A recent poll showed that Yucca Mountain was the top issue for 3% of registered voters. \"Given what's going on in this country, 3% is huge,\" said Ms Maze Johnson. </p> <p>The polls in Nevada have ranged between a 10% lead for Mr Bush to a 1% lead for Mr Kerry. In 2000 Mr Bush won the state by 3.5%, or 22,000 votes, but Nevada has changed since then. The fastest-growing state in the US in 2003, its population has risen by 300,000 in the past four years to reach 2.4 million. For this election, there will be 1.1 million registered voters, 66,000 of them Hispanics, who traditionally lean toward the Democratic party. The increase in population means that Nevada now contributes five votes to the electoral college, one more than in 2000. Accordingly, the state has become an increasingly important and hard-fought battleground in this year's electoral race. </p> <p>\"In 2000 there was no campaign here; the Democrats conceded,\" said David Damore, assistant professor of political science at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas. \"But this year there's been a strong effort to get new voters registered. The electorate looks very different to the way it did four years ago.\" </p> <p>While voters in the state are likely to be swayed by the same big issues as the rest of the country - the economy, the war in Iraq - Nevada is one swing state where the debate about the environment, thanks to Yucca Mountain, is being aired. </p> <p>John Kerry has been swift to side with opponents of the plan. In an article published in the Las Vegas Review-Journal in May, Mr Kerry accused Bush of \"placing the profits of the nuclear power industry above the safety of Nevada families ... I voted against the plan to dispose of waste at Yucca Mountain,\" he wrote, \"and as president I will fight against it.\" </p> <p>Republicans chose to use the Yucca Mountain issue as an opportunity to depict Mr Kerry as a \"flip-flopper\", pointing out that he had voted in favour of a 1987 bill, nicknamed the Screw Nevada bill, which authorised consideration of Yucca Mountain as the nation's repository for nuclear waste. </p> <p>In August Mr Kerry defended his position, saying: \"Back in 1987 the idea of a national repository seemed like a reasonable thing ... [but] the more I have looked at the issue, the more I have learned about it, the less safe, the less comfortable I am with the possibility.\" </p> <p>Also in August, Mr Bush told a rally in Las Vegas: \"I said I would make a decision based upon [sound] science, not politics ... and that's exactly what I did.\" </p> <p>Ms Maze Johnson said: \"The president called it sound science. I call it botched science. We're not partisan, but Kerry has been with us when we've needed his vote, which isn't easy for someone from the north-east.\" </p> <p>The north-east of the US is home to the bulk of the country's nuclear energy industry. At present nuclear waste is stored on site: across the US, 161 million people live within 75 miles of temporarily stored nuclear waste. </p> <p>Local residents and politicians are keen to see it moved as far away as possible, and the sparsely-populated deserts of Nevada seemed as good an idea as any. Those opposed to the repository are also concerned about the transport of waste. It is, critics say, a disaster waiting to happen, mobile Chernobyls offering the perfect terrorist target. </p> <p>\"We are a one-industry state,\" said Ms Johnson, referring to Nevada's dependence on tourism. \"If something stopped people coming, what would that do to the economy?\" </p> <p>At the Yucca Mountain Information Centre, videos and wallcharts trumpet the efforts to ensure that the site is safe. </p> <p>No mention is made of the native American name for the mountain, Moving Hill, nor scientists' nickname for it, Old Leaky. Nor is there space for a Geological Society of America report which warned that should moisture enter the mountain where nuclear waste is stored in bundles of rods, \"radioactive volcanoes could form on the surface\".</p>",
  "Clark County's mid-western calm seems unruffled by the international flood of emails (The last post, G2, October 21). \"The Guardian ends letter-writing campaign\" was the third in the Springfield News-Sun website's local headlines yesterday. That is after a review of Miss Saigon and \"Historical Society to offer appraisals of antique items\". The opinion section is empty and a site search for \"Guardian\" brings up as the first item a story on gay soccer teams, which says: \"As Britain's Guardian newspaper put it, 'football is coming homo'.\" So Clark County clearly takes note of what the Guardian says. <br> <b>Andrew Grant-Adamson</b> <br> Debenham, Suffolk <p>So thousands were willing to pay 47c to write to the residents of Clark County to urge a vote for Kerry. My wife (Letters, October 18) forgot to register for an overseas vote and at \u00a3256 return she flies to the US next week to vote for Kerry, though we are natural Nader supporters. If readers want to throw in 47c each, it would be appreciated. Seriously, this election is important, please keep urging our American friends to vote Kerry.<br> <b>Jon Fanning</b><br> London<br></p> <p>I agree with the outraged respondents who are vigorously asking readers to refrain from trying to influence their choice of president. We have no business interfering in US domestic politics and I look forward to seeing letters from these upright citizens to Tony Blair and Geoff Hoon abusing them for sending British forces into the areas near Baghdad. Such blatant interference in US politics is not to be tolerated, especially by the proud citizens of Clark County.<br> <b>Suman Nambiar</b><br> London<br></p> <p>The US correspondents who regard your Clark County letter-writing campaign as unwarranted interference have a point. But this is small beer. The most substantial previous campaign of this kind was prior to the Italian general election of 1948, with the Communist-Socialist bloc poised for victory. In the US, Italian-Americans were urged to write to their kin-folk calling on them to vote against the left and 10m letters were sent to Italy.</p> <p>The message was that a victory for the left would mean no Marshall Aid for Italy and, for the supporters of the left ticket, the possibility of excommunication by the Catholic church. To accompany this, the CIA covertly channelled up to $3m into the coffers of the Christian Democrats - who duly won and held office for the next 40 years. Now that's a real campaign.<br> <b>Anthony Carew</b><br> Stockport, Cheshire</p>",
  "President George Bush's efforts to inoculate his re-election campaign from popular anger over a shortage of flu jabs were shaken yesterday by reports that prominent Republicans had jumped the queue for the vaccine. <p>Only days after Mr Bush urged healthy Americans to go without this winter so that the elderly, children and the infirm could have first call it emerged that Vice-President Dick Cheney, the treasury secretary, John Snow, and the Senate majority leader, Bill Frist, had all received jabs. </p> <p>A shortfall of 50 million doses - caused by contamination of vaccines at a British manufacturer - has emerged as an issue in the election, with the Democratic challenger, John Kerry, accusing the Bush administration of mismanaging health care. </p> <p>Both he and his running mate, John Edwards, have said they will forgo the vaccine this year. Mr Bush says he will do the same, but that has done little to allay growing concern about the vaccine shortfall, or anger about the lack of a rational distribution system. </p> <p>Mr Cheney had the shot because, aides say, he falls into the high-risk category as a survivor of four heart attacks. \"He gets them every year at the recommendation of his doctors because of his 25-year history of heart disease,\" said a spokeswoman. </p> <p>This explanation will probably satisfy many Democrats - Bill Clinton also received the vaccine after undergoing heart-bypass surgery last month. </p> <p>But there is likely to be less understanding of Dr Frist, a physician, who said members of Congress were also in a high-risk group because they had to mingle with the public and shake a lot of hands as part of their official duties. </p> <p>\"Once again, the Bush administration proves that it is the 'do as we say, not as we do' White House,\" said a Kerry campaign statement. </p> <p>Mr Bush's health secretary, Tommy Thompson, has refused to set mandatory guidelines for vaccine distribution or declare a public health emergency, saying this would cause too much confusion.</p>",
  "<p>Thank you for this invitation: it is an honour to speak here, to this audience, at the invitation of Paddy Coulter on behalf of Reuters. I'd like to say later why Reuters bestows honour. </p> <p>The higher journalism loves to throw in a literary allusion, in order to prove that its writer is higher than journalism. The higher newsrooms owe nothing so much to Oxford as the Oxford Dictionary of Quotations.</p> <p>The one I want to try on you is the character Malvolio in Twelfth Night; and his parallel with the British media.</p> <p>The name of Malvolio is adapted from the Italian - Mal: bad; volio: I want. I want bad. </p> <p>The Countess Olivia, who is Malvolio's mistress in the sense of his employer, says of him early in the play - 'Oh, you are sick of self love, Malvolio, and taste with a distempered appetite. To be generous, guiltless and of a free disposition is to take those things for bird bolts that you deem cannon bullets'. </p> <p>Taking bird bolts for cannon bullets is literally mistaking the small arrows, once used for shooting birds, for cannon balls: tasting with a distempered appetite needs no explanation. It's a good description of what we in the media usually do; because that's also what the prevailing journalistic culture prompts us to do - to magnify the uncomfortable fact that we know about a public figure or an event into an explanation, implicitly or explicitly, of the event's ramifications, or the public figures actions as a whole. </p> <p>It is synecdoche journalism. Synecdoche is that figure of speech we learned at school: the part for the whole. The part, or the fact which journalism picks out, may be right in itself (it may not): it is the use made of it, and the context in which it is placed, or the context which is not or is inadequately explained, which can give it its aspect of a cannon bullet when it should be a bird bolt, or for that matter vice versa. </p> <p>Olivia's little description of Malvolio is a brilliant encapsulation of one of the deepest springs of journalistic action. 'I want bad': I want a disaster to happen near me, with no other journalists present; I want things to go spectacularly wrong, and for someone to tell me the inside story of it to me only; I want, at least, violent personality clashes which can be presented as explanations for public policy. And when I have this nugget, which no one else has or no one else has as fast, I wish it to be a cannon ball, blasting its way into the attention of a distracted audience. </p> <p>Male voglio: it has come to be an unavoidable character trait which journalists must have when they come into journalism or which they must develop soon when they are in it. When the sunny tempered ITN newscaster Martyn Lewis began to push his idea for 'good news' coverage, he was regarded as an idiot, and it was soon forgotten, except as a foolish notion. </p> <p>This is now, often, the journalistic equivalent of that central spring which powered economic activity, as proposed by Adam Smith. Smith said it wasn't the benignity, but the 'interest', the - same word as Shakespeare puts in Olivia's mouth about Malvolio - 'self love' of the butcher, the baker or the brewer which ensured that they would produce our dinner every day. Is it the wishing for bad - a trait at least as unattractive as the self-interest and self love of the tradesman - which makes us invaluable? Which renders us the pillars of democracy we say we are and which, curiously enough, we actually are?</p> <p>Smith wrote of the economic actor that 'he generally neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it. He intends only his own gain and he is, in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention'. That is a good way of describing how many, maybe most, journalists define their trade. And at least to some degree, it is inevitable. If greed can be benign, so too can wishing the bad. But it isn't enough: not nearly.</p> <p>As the clutch of memoirs by Jon Snow, Michael Buerk and Andrew Marr out this autumn attest, journalists, even rich and famous ones, tend to write about themselves as if they were a bunch of hopeless hacks lurching from one damn thing to another, driven not by a consciousness of civic duty but by a compulsion to beat the competition, or be famous, or dish the dirt on someone. </p> <p>But at the end, it turns out all right. The mistakes, downright lies, betrayals of confidences, padded expense accounts, free trips provided by public relations companies, character assassinations, editorial column vapidities, insults (especially to Liverpool), evasions, omissions, misspellings, misnamings, misattributions, indifferences, forgetfulnesses, prejudices, spites, flatteries - all come together nightly, or as it may be now hourly, into a paper of a bulletin or a programme and - with a transmutation worthy of a great magician, these base electronic impulses are turned into the gold of information essential to the citizen, of trenchant and critical comment and of democratic debate. How? It's a miracle.</p> <p>Is this what the news media are becoming? Are we now lending ourselves to the production of a written and broadcast universe composed of vast swathes of what one might call consumption journalism, with a layer of quotidian writing and broadcasting of events announced by official and corporate news releases and press conferences, with running commentaries from a regiment of columnists. In the first of what will be an annual event, the Hugo Young Memorial Lecture, given on Wednesday of this week, my colleague Philip Stephens, the chief political columnist of the FT, criticised his own columnists' trade for being 'not one these days which can claim a high reputation. Political journalism in particular is too often shoddy and partisan. Polemic has become an excuse for intellectual laziness, assertion a substitute for fact and analysis'.</p> <p>On top of this, the icing on the case, there is the level of revelatory stories based on leaks and discoveries and whistleblowing - which should be and sometimes is a particular pride of an inquiring journalism. But, actually, it's become quite hard to make well-grounded judgements about them. Many of these revelations have real value: they tell us something about a world of decisions and calculations and actions which is at least partly hidden from view and which affects our lives, or should affect our own decisions. Abu Ghraib was one such revelation, which has affected a great deal. </p> <p>But revelations aren't explanations. We can be very short on these. And if the media cast a pall over themselves by being unclear about how they know what they say they know, on what grounds with which sources, and what limits to set on their knowledge: if they don't make clear the known unknowns and even confess there are many unknown unknowns in what they are proposing - that is, if they don't have an appropriate modesty or at least a measure of accuracy about what they know they know - then the result is a general bewilderment. And perhaps a general turning away from the world of affairs. </p> <p>I want to put these general observations at the head of what I 'm saying tonight, because I think they express a particular kind of dilemma for what Andrew Marr calls 'my trade', that is, the trade of news journalism: the communication of current events to audiences and readers. And we can put the dilemma, or dilemmas, like this</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> there is a dilemma of complexity <strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> there is a dilemma of entertainment <strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> and there is a dilemma of effect</p> <p>Though we have been told over and over that the world is globalised, nevertheless it is obviously true. One of the effects of this is to add to the evident complexity of everything. Decisions are now taken increasingly against a global matrix - whether in parliaments or boardrooms or cabinet rooms or trade union conferences or the offices of NGOs. </p> <p>There never were simple explanations for current events; it is now more clearly so. In the case which dominates all of the news bulletins, it is simply not knowable whether or not the invasion of Iraq will lead to a better society in Iraq, better and more open and more prosperous societies in the Middle East and an earlier end to terrorism - or to a long, bloody and ultimately deepening chaos, perhaps leading to a state of affairs worse than that which existed before the invasion, in Iraq and in the region. There are too many imponderables. </p> <p>It is not knowable if the European Union will develop further in the direction of becoming a state power, or remain a loose confederation of free trading states with certain democratic predispositions in common. </p> <p>It is not knowable if China will, as it becomes richer and more powerful - including more militarily powerful - be an authoritarian threat in its region and the world, or develop as a peaceful and co-operative democracy. </p> <p>It is not even knowable if those leaders of democratic states - President Chirac is the latest - who go to Beijing to drum up business and be tactful about issues like human rights, the treatment of Tibet and the threats to Taiwan may actually further the democratic development of China, or confirm it in its authoritarian practices. </p> <p>Because we cannot know outcomes, we should not, if we are trying to do proper journalism - that is, a journalism which gives people facts and analysis and impressions and leaves it up to them to judge what opinions they form of these - suffuse our reportage with an implicit knowledge of the finite pattern of the events we describe, a knowledge which is often based on the assumption that it will all go badly. Male voglio. </p> <p>An exploration of complexity demands a steady and close attention to the content of events and the people who drive them, to their contexts and their limitations, to their antecedents and their influences. Increasingly, as you talk to politicians and officials and executives about how their trades and the journalism about them meet each other, they talk of parallel universes. That is, there is what they do and how they do it: and then there is the journalism about what they do and how they do it: and they exist quite separately from each other. The journalism partakes of the field of action apparently described: and some of the characters exist and some of the events are recognisable. But as a description of what really happens, it's deeply inadequate - or so say the politicians and the corporate executives and the trade union leaders and the bishops and the heads of NGOs and the generals and the top civil servants and the council leaders and the ministers and even the academics.</p> <p>Is that what they would say - those with some or a lot of power with secrets to keep and manoeuvres to hide? \"That's what they would say, wouldn't they?\" is the cover-all excuse given to us more than 40 years ago by Mandy Rice Davies? Of course one on whom the whistle has been blown will blame the whistler: but that is wearing threadbare. There is a rising tide of complaint from every side, so forcefully expressed and so variously expressed that it demands more than dismissal.</p> <p>The dilemma is this. The world is very complex. It takes a lot of understanding. We are citizens, who have the right to vote for or against governments and councils and thus need to be informed of the choices we make. But mass journalism - on TV and in mass newspapers - inform us less than they used to do. </p> <p>All of our broadcasters have cut back on the time given to news and current affairs in the mainstream channels - and though they have expanded into 24-hour news services, which are tremendously useful, the analysis and investigation and debate which is essential to being informed isn't more plentiful. Debate is often partisan shouting: analysis is often an expert on for two minutes; investigation is often putting a revelation on without a context, sometimes without adequate checking. There probably is more news: there probably is less understanding of news.</p> <p>Mass circulation papers have certainly given no more time to foreign - and to domestic - news. There are fewer correspondents abroad: more is written in offices; opinion columns, often by people who have little or no experience of reporting the fields about which they write but are hired for being 'edgy' or 'radical' or 'fearless', now crowd out reporting. Reporting itself, like the front pages of The Independent, is indistinguishable from comment: is comment. </p> <p>Thus more complexity meets less explanation. And the answer to this from journalists, or at least editors and managers, is: who wants to read or look at it? Look at what happens when we put this stuff on! Viewing falls over the cliff. Circulations fall. And indeed, what happens when you put on soaps and big brother, or tabloidise your paper and make it more opinionated and edgy: audience figures rise, and so does the circulation. There's no quick fix out of this. </p> <p>The second dilemma is entertainment. We can't say that news and entertainment live in two separate spheres any more: the line has been and is still being blurred between the two. This began happening when TV came of age, in the early sixties. One of the reasons President Kennedy is still regarded with such favour by the sixties generation which now runs things is because he was the first TV president. </p> <p>In his marvellous book, The Powers that Be, David Halberstam writes of him that 'in no way could Kennedy have been elected without television. It was that simple. He meshed politics and television with such charm and style and </p> <p>despatch that the intellectual elite of the country which might normally have regarded the cross blend with trepidation, rich as it was in the potential for demagoguery, enthusiastically applauded him (in large part because the alternative to Kennedy was Richard M Nixon). Television loved him, he and the camera were born for each other, he was the first great political superstar; as he made television bigger, it made him bigger. Everyone using everyone. The media using the President, the President using the media'. </p> <p>Kennedy made the first Faustian bargain of the TV age in politics. He brought TV in to take the place of parties and smoke filled rooms and deals and compromises among the old powers that were. And he made it for all other politicians who aspired to high office after him: he made performance on TV the standard of future politicians, whether they liked it or not. His celebrated debate with Nixon helped establish him not just as the leading politician of his age, but establish TV as the leading political arbiter of the age.</p> <p>As the TV age has gone on, we've remarked that, at least in the US, the actor as politician has become more prominent - Ronald Reagan and Arnold Schwarzenegger to mention only two governors of California. The politician as actor is also remarked: the mastery of TV which Tony Blair was once said to have; the inability to master it which Ian Duncan Smith displayed. Ian Duncan Smith was a kind of throwback to the pre-television age: a man elected by and popular with his party. One of the reasons why the Tories have attracted so much scorn - including from within their own party - is that they should be so foolish as to think that someone whom the Party liked but the media didn't should be elected its leader. He simply didn't produce the kind of level of TV performance that's acceptable.</p> <p>Something else is now happening. The fictionalisation of the public sphere is well advanced. West Wing is a post 9/11 version of politics practised by professionals - un-illusioned, quick witted, sardonic but never cynical, good hearted, loyal, devoted to public service. It is politics without party, where aides who know the media count for everything and senators and congressmen and governors lurch in occasionally like creatures from olden times, to be patronised and ushered out. Unconsciously, West Wing shows politics as the media have helped make it - where media have replaced parties.</p> <p>The BBC tried a pilot of its own 'West Wing' in a piece of work called 'The Deputy': it had at its centre a character so like a version of John Prescott cooked up by someone fed on the vast library of caricatures about him as to be suable. It was a hideous programme. Luckily, it didn't survive the pilot: but both the US and the British programmes showed the way in which fiction has moved in to the same arena as news: it is creating an environment, a context, a received opinion - and the fictional and the real words bounce off each other, both using stereotypes and caricatures, until the line between them may, for most people, no longer properly exist.</p> <p>The BBC more recently did a programme called 'Dirty Bomb' - about the effects on London of a bomb which released radioactive material over the City of London. It was a dramatic film showing dedicated and courageous police fire officers coping with a disaster while inadequately equipped by a government which was concerned more with bright spin than with grim reality. </p> <p>Every care was taken to make it seem as realistic as possible - down to naming the fictional Minister for London as Nicola Painswick, while the real one is called Nicholas Raynsford. The problem was not its production quality: the problem was for the audience. Had the BBC got a very large story - which was that, in the event of a serious terrorist attack, we were woefully unprepared? If so, shouldn't it have put on a two hour Panorama in the same prime time slot as the fiction film saying so - and publicising it hugely? </p> <p>The viewer, or at least this viewer, was left wondering whether he should pursue the issue as a citizen or enjoy its tension and drama as a spectator, on the same level as a Hollywood thriller. </p> <p>This was evidently not a problem for the BBC, which promoted the film as a serious bit of deeply researched public interest film while insisting on its fictional status - a sign that the most serious broadcaster in the world had lost interest in separating the two - because it had lost interest in judging the effect on its audience, who it presumably believed didn't care, or accepted that fiction could tell the truth as well as documentary. Fiction can, of course, tell some truths better than journalism can: but at the level of Anna Karenina , not at that of 'Dirty Bomb'. </p> <p>The dilemma of effects is precisely that we don't know what we're doing to the people who read and, above all, who view - though Robert Putnam's Bowling Alone, published four years ago, argued that television was the largest single cause of civic disengagement, writing that 'it is precisely those Americans most marked by their dependence on televised entertainment who were most likely to have dropped out of civic and social life - who spent less time with friends, were less involved in community organisations and were less likely to participate in public affairs'. </p> <p>Putnam made an important distinction here - between watching news TV, where viewers were more likely to be civically engaged, and watching entertainment TV. But there is less and less current affairs TV: and as we saw, that there is, is more like entertainment - as he writes, 'modern media...increasingly blur the line between the two'. As far as I am aware, no serious study has been done in this country of how far this applies to the British.</p> <p>The media broadcast and write continually on voter apathy, the collapse of parties and the disengagement of, especially, the young from politics and public life: we don't know how much we cause it: the most recent. We know that public figures complain constantly that good people aren't coming forward to take public jobs because of what they see will be pressure from the media, and fear of the media: but we don't know if this is true. If it is true it's a dramatic story: but we haven't looked into it. We know that news and current affairs play a smaller role in mainstream broadcasting than they used to: we don't know if that means that people are less interested in current events than they used to be - know less, reflect less, are less good at being citizens. </p> <p>Broadcasters know they are the most powerful show on earth - and they have apparently no interest in knowing what effect they have on the audience, as long as they keep on watching. And to keep them watching, they will - as Peter Finch's demented newscaster, Howard Beale, said in the movie Network - 'do any damn thing you want' - including dropping news and current affairs, and justifying it by reference to ratings. </p> <p>Even those who blow the whistle most now feel inadequate. Kevin Marsh, the editor of the Today programme with whom I've argued on this publicly, and who was the programme's editor during the Andrew Gilligan affair almost a year and a half ago, told the Society of Editors on Tuesday of this week that 'we (in the media) have got to a position where a free press, ostensibly underpinned </p> <p>by tried and tested principles is, at best, failing to support public institutions. At worst undermining them'. There is, said Marsh,'hypocrisy in much of the press, that wants a scalp - a result - while at the same time denying the press should be concerned about its effect on public life - or even acknowledge it had one'.</p> <p>There is much disagreement among journalists about these matters, and I'm pleased to say that some of the things I've written have caused some of that. In another lecture this week - that by Greg Dyke, the James Cameron Memorial - the former director general subjected a book I'd written, 'What the media are doing to our politics', to a sustained critique, arguing that I was entirely wrong to say that Andrew Gilligan had been mistaken in its famous story of the 29th of May last year, and that he, Dyke, had behaved with principle in refusing to retract or apologise: the BBC Board of Governors were wrong in forcing him to resign, and in grovelling to the government with an apology issued by the acting chairman after the chairman, Gavyn Davies, had resigned. This isn't the place to respond to Greg Dyke in any detail: more detail will be found in The Observer on Sunday.</p> <p>But I believe that the story, and the reaction to it and debate about it, reveal a situation which demands a different approach to that we have now. Journalism is terribly important: more important, ironically, than we have allowed. It is part of a great power, which is the media: and they make up, below the state, the greatest aggregation of power in the land. </p> <p>When Anthony Sampson published his 'Who Runs this Place\" earlier this year - a revisiting, 40 years on, from his first Anatomy of Britain - he remarked that of all the powers which had waxed and waned in the close to half century between the first book and the most recent, that which had waxed everyone else off the map was the power of the media. He wrote - 'the masters of the media are the new aristocracy, demanding and receiving homage from politicians, big businessmen and the aristocracy...columnists and broadcasters are more famous than the politicians or public figures they interview; they know they can make or break reputations and ruin political careers.' </p> <p>This is a good place to return, as I said I would, to Reuters, our hosts. Journalists' pursuit of a truth can break themselves, and indeed end their lives. Journalists die in greater numbers than they used to - in Iraq, in Chechnya, in the Balkans, in Colombia, in Africa. Often - most often - they are men and women we rarely hear of, who run up against a local boss or a mafia chieftain or a vengeful army </p> <p>or police force. Often they are casualties of war. They include Daniel Pearl, from the Wall Street Journal, two years ago. Simon Cumbers, a BBC cameraman was killed in Saudi Arabia this year: with him was Frank Gardner, the BBC Security Correspondent, who was injured. Two French journalists, Christian Chesnot of Radio France International and Georges Malbrunot of Figaro, are still held in Iraq: the Italian freelance writer Enzo Baldoni was killed. That is only a few.</p> <p>The first speaker in this series, John Simpson, has for decades shown himself to one of the great explainers of foreign events, and one of the most courageous of reporters in pursuing the facts and the truth - nearly paying for it, in Afghanistan, with his life. Reuters, which endows this lecture, has still the greatest concentration of foreign correspondents in the world: I know, from my years in Central Europe and the former Soviet Union, that they have some of the bravest. My present colleagues - indeed, my present editor - often served their time before one or other of Reuters' masts: it often took guts, and not the kind of guts you get from eating too many lunches. </p> <p>Media's proudest boast, and indeed their main reason for being considered indispensable to a free society, is usually said to be to hold power to account. I think we should consider a change in that formula, to make it clearer what should be the role of media in a genuinely free society. It is to assist the people of that society to understand all kinds of powers - state, corporate, associative, cultural, foreign - so they, the people, can hold them to account through their actions, chief among which must be voting and other participation in civic life. Such a huge power must itself be understood, and held to account.</p> <p>In this we need the academy, as well as broader civil society, to be engaged. The academy and the media are often awkward together; media studies are often regarded as a not quite the thing. There may be, in academic terms, justification for this: but I think it essential that the academy extend its skills and status more decisively into the area of the media, and that the media partake of some of the independence ands rigour of the best of the academy in order to assist it develop and understand itself. </p> <p>The academy is or should be a place where independence of thought and judgement is unquestioned; and in the US, large and well funded departments and institutes within or close to universities provide an intellectual rigour to journalism, which helps keep at least some of it faithful to a discussion and illumination of public affairs far beyond what we have. In the Committee for Concerned Journalists and the Project for Excellence in Journalism, run by Bill Kovach and Tom Rosenstiel, it has produced from within the profession the most serious effort to regenerate journalism I've seen, one we could do much worse than to adapt for our culture. </p> <p>US newspapers, including those people here don't read - big city papers like those in Pittsburg or Cleveland or Miami or Dallas - have a culture of explanation and investigation which our nationals have often lost. Even the relentlessly commercial networks and new digital channels are capable of probing and occasionally analytical journalism: it was CBS, after all, which broke the Abu Ghraib horror. If we cite Fox as a disgrace - and in terms of journalism it is - it has at least put before us the need to either accept that news and current affairs will now be politicised to the left and right, a trend Fox did not begin: or, as I believe better, to redefine more robustly the duties, scope and limits of a public service in news and current affairs which can aspire to give a version of the truth. </p> <p>Above all, I think of magazine journalism like that of the New Yorker, New Republic, Atlantic, NY Review of Books, Harpers, Vanity Fair, American Prospect, the Nation, the Weekly Standard and many more. The debasement of our political weeklies, once prides of the world, is shown in the absurdity that the editor of The Spectator, having published an editorial critical of Liverpool (a city about which the Spectator knows much from years of on-site reporting) is then forced to make a florid apology by the leader of the main opposition party in which he is a front bench spokesman. Serious political journalism, whatever its opinions, should be independent: especially in a magazine which insists so often on its ability to unmask New Labour lies. If it is seen to denounce one week an opinion which it has pronounced trenchantly the previous one, how to evaluate everything else? What to make of its editor's opinions - and the opinions he allows in his paper?</p> <p>We need the academy and journalism to collaborate in an examination, independent but deeply and daily engaged, of media power and effect. We need a place - more than a few committed people struggling on inadequate funds, as the brave MediaWise has done in seeking to call attention to the damaging effects media can have on ordinary people - in which research, and investigation, and information, and analysis, and discussion, and argument are all possible and are constantly being provided. We need a place dedicated to raising journalism's game by examining journalism's power within media power. We need to see what the media are doing to journalism, and how far the two can happily co-exist - and if this sounds like saying that one might blame the media for the state of journalism, that may not be as absurd as it presently sounds. We need above all to take seriously a craft and a practice which remains the first recourse for most people when they wish to understand the world beyond their own horizons: must take seriously its own protestations of freedom and democracy; must take serious its own claim to be at once above power in its ability to analyse it, and below it in its refusal to be part of it. </p> <p>There is, the media tell us, a crisis in society: a crisis of withdrawal of engagement and of trust. Implicitly and explicitly, we in the media put the responsibility for that on public figures; usually politicians. We should, in the pursuit of our own ideals, look at ourselves as actors, as well as continue to act as investigators. The development of such a centre or centres, and with it the development of a journalism which was analytical of itself as well as of other powers, would be a large contribution to the continued freedom of a society which cannot be free without free media, who wish to understand, and assist the rest of us to understand, what freedom is. So that, even as we sometimes, a regrettable tic of the trade, want bad - vogliamo male; we faciamo bene: we do good.</p>",
  "<p>The presidential candidate John Kerry has a 13-point lead over George Bush in a new poll of voting intentions - among American students.</p> <p>If US campuses were deciding the race for the White House Mr Kerry would be a dead certainty, according to the poll by Harvard University's institute of politics.</p> <p>What's more, their votes could be vital in the tightly fought contest. Students in swing states are backing the Democrat candidate, leading President Bush by 17 points.</p> <p>\"There are nine million college students in America, and their vote will matter this year - especially in swing states,\" said the director of the institute, Philip Sharp. \"Neither campaign can afford to ignore them. Our findings represent a major revival of student political engagement.\"</p> <p>The poll of 1,200 students, by one of the most respected political research institutes in the world, also reveals the reason behind students' support for Kerry - or opposition to Bush. They are most worried about the economy, followed by the war in Iraq and the spread of international terrorism. Moral issues, such as gay marriage and abortion, and education, also feature. </p> <p>The dissatisfaction is such that more students than ever are likely to go out and vote; 72% of the students polled claimed to be registered and ready to vote.</p> <p>According to the survey, politics is a regular topic of conversation among American students. Of those polled, 75% said they had discussed the election in the past 24 hours, and 91% said they cared a \"good deal\" about the outcome of the election. </p> <p>Student support for Mr Kerry comes despite the fact that most believe the president to be the \"stronger and clearer\" leader. More than half (52%) of students said they would vote for Mr Kerry, compared with 39% who said President Bush would get their vote. </p> <p>But on the strength of leadership skills, 49% backed the president, while 36% backed Mr Kerry. Asked who they believed took a \"clear stand on issues\", 57% said President Bush and 27% said Mr Kerry. </p> <p>In contrast 54%, said the Democrat \"understands the problems\" of people like them, compared with 31% who said the same of the president.</p> <p>The poll, which has been conducted four times a year since 2000, also showed that America's students are becoming more partisan. The number of students identifying themselves as independent has fallen over the past year by 8%, with Mr Kerry hoovering up the majority of those votes. </p> <p>It also revealed that programmes to encourage students to get out and vote were working, with 62% saying they had had contact with campaigns to get them to vote. </p> <p>David King, associate director of the institute, said: \"Students in swing states have been approached time and again about registering and about voting, and those on-campus drives have clearly mobilised thousands of new voters.\"</p>",
  "<p>These days, fashion is seldom far from a cinema screen and concert stage, whether it features in the release of a big-budget Hollywood film costumed by Giorgio Armani - such as Irwin Winkler's recently released Cole Porter biopic, De-Lovely - or as a global tour fronted by a pretty pop star styled by Dolce &amp; Gabbana. But lately the London fashion scene has produced a spate of eclectic productions - collaborations between inventive artistic minds and edgy local fashion talent - that although small in scale in comparison with the blockbuster joint ventures, have brought a new energy to the performing arts. </p> <p>Take Liebeslied/My Suicides, a one-hour opera investigating the fraught dynamics of a love triangle, which is staged tonight and Saturday at London's ICA theatre. The assignment of costuming the opera came to Boudicca, the London design label operated by Zowie Broach and Brian Kirkby, completely by chance. The Southwark contemporary art gallery, Union, represents the German, east London-based photographer Rut Blees Luxembourg. She was the driving force behind Liebeslied/My Suicides, which evolved from a series of urban landscape photographs she published four years ago and which are used as the opera's set backdrop. The gallery emailed Boudicca's studio proposing that they provide the clothes for the opera's tenor, mezzo and soprano. </p> <p>Music is an integral part of Boudicca's identity. Every season, its shows are set to compositions created as a response to its clothes by the experimental composer Daniel Pemberton. \"The Libertines, a bit of classical, some film soundtracks,\" says Kirkby, describing the kind of CDs that are on permanent rotation inside Boudicca's studio as he and Broach create their luxurious ready-to-wear. But opera has never been a part of the Boudicca playlist. </p> <p>Boudicca was as much of an unknown quantity to Blees Luxembourg. Though her Shoreditch live-and-work space is close by Boudicca's studio in Hackney Wick, she had never heard of the label until her gallery suggested it among a possible list of three London designers who might be right to costume the opera. Though Blees Luxembourg possesses the prerequisites qualifying her to be a hip Hoxton type - sparkling talent (her work is part of Tate Britain's permanent collection), good looks and, just like Sofia Coppola, she has a delicious wine named in her honour by her vintner father - she was a fashion novice who had never been to a catwalk show. </p> <p>Her photographs of unoccupied office blocks, kerbside gratings and urban detritus, always shot after dark using ambient light, had a synergy with Boudicca's ideas. Hunter Gatherer - Boudicca's autumn/winter 2004 collection from which ensembles were selected for the opera - was coincidentally inspired by large-scale photographs shot by the New York art photographer Gregory Crewdson, and his macabre dreamscape aesthetic is similar to that which governs Blees Luxembourg's work. \"Their work had the right amount of drama necessary for the production,\" says Blees Luxembourg of Boudicca, who are now collaborating on an experimental film project with film director Mike Figgis. </p> <p>Kinvara Balfour, author and star of the comedy of manners Dazed &amp; Abused, which closed at London's Canal Cafe theatre last night and looks set to transfer to New York next winter, credits the fashionable touch of Nicky Haslam, the interior designer, with helping make her play a success. \"He's got such a great look - one day he's wearing Abercrombie &amp; Fitch tracksuit bottoms, and the next he arrives in top-to-toe Dolce &amp; Gabbana,\" Balfour says of 60-year-old Haslam. When Dazed was first accepted at the August 2004 Edinburgh fringe festival, Balfour consid ered playing it safe and wearing Armani on stage. But she decided that Haslam, who is a veteran of Tatler's \"most invited\" list, was the man to dress the stage and cast of her play, which investigates London's hip high society life. </p> <p>Haslam masterminded the set - a stark, black-and-white bachelor pad dominated by that classic Noughties trophy, a Damien Hirst spot painting (which is a fake and painted in turns by the cast). It immortalised Dazed's world and the sleek looks he planned for the cast, though they came together on a shoe string, turned the right heads. Every night, says Balfour, she was asked about the provenance of the show-stopping stage attire she assembled on Haslam's suggestion - a clingy La Perla black dress she found at the London second-hand designer shop Sign of the Times, and which she paired with Jimmy Choo stilettos she picked up at a sample sale. </p> <p>Of course, the history of collaborations between fashion and stage has not always been smooth. In 1931, Coco Chanel signed a $1 million contract with United Artists to create costumes for the independent Hollywood studio. But she quit working for UA soon after her second production, Tonight or Never. Gloria Swanson, the film's star, arrived in Paris for her second fitting with Chanel wearing a panty girdle to conceal the early stages of a pregnancy she had to hide from prying gossip columnists. Chanel was furious that Swanson had gained weight in between fittings. Swanson, a recent divorcee, couldn't reveal her secret to Chanel - fearing that news of her having a child out of wedlock with her then lover, Michael Farmer, a playboy friend of Noel Coward, would tarnish her reputation. So instead of confessing that, she played the diva, insisting that Chanel create a bespoke panty girdle from a special rubberised material she found on her gynaecologist's examining table. \"No! Lose five pounds!\" Chanel shrieked at Swanson's proposal. Chanel eventually submitted to Swanson's demand but, to her, it was insulting. In the realm of Paris haute couture, the designer was perceived to be the star to whose vision a client always submitted. </p> <p>But there have been very many successful collaborations between legendary actors and great designers - examples being the six films that Audrey Hepburn appeared in wearing couture by Hubert de Givenchy, and Halston's work styling Liza Minnelli and dressing sexy Jacqueline Bisset for the kitsch 1978 love story, The Greek Tycoon. And then there is Giorgio Armani, who, since dressing Richard Gere for American Gigolo, has racked up dozens of costume credits on feature films. A year ago, Alberta Ferretti made her stage debut designing all the costumes worn by the principal cast for Francesco Esposito's summer 2003 production of Bizet's Carmen, which triumphantly opened Rome's refurbished opera house. </p> <p>Just released is Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow, Kerry Conran's sci-fi thriller. It was made on a low budget and shot in just 26 days, thanks to a time-saving special-effects process. But what has added to its huge box-office appeal in the US is not only the cast (Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow) but also the sophisticated costumes, designed by Stella McCartney. This month's Vogue hailed her debut as a screen-costume designer, summing up the 30s-inspired tweed suit, swish trilby and chic, shawl-collared coat she made for Paltrow as \"sexy, iconic and fabulously retro\". Film critic Derek Malcolm compared Paltrow's polished cool in the film to the most ravishing woman ever to grace the big screen - Greta Garbo. A huge compliment not only to the actress, but also to the fashionista who created her clothes.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Liebeslied/My Suicides, An Opera by Rut Blees Luxembourg, Alexander Garcia Duttmann and Paul Clark is on tonight and tomorrow, 7.30pm.

  "Billions of pounds, enough to pay for the entire primary health and education needs of the world's developing countries, are being siphoned off through offshore companies and tax havens, according to a body formed to expose the offenders. <br> Aid organisations are alarmed that money that should be used for building the infrastructure of the poorest countries is being hidden in havens by corrupt politicians and multinationals exploiting tax loopholes. Offshore companies are being formed at the rate of about 150,000 a year. While in the 70s there were just 25 tax havens, there are at least 63 now, about half of them British protectorates or former colonies. Tax avoidance in Britain alone is estimated at between $45bn and $150bn.  The Tax Justice Network, which was formed last year by tax experts and economists worried about the trend, has just launched an international secretariat in London. It will work with the UN and other international bodies to reverse the practice of hiding money from governments worldwide.  John Christensen, coordinator of the secretariat, said: \"Many developing countries are now dominated by elites that are involved in tax havens. Things have actually got worse in the last few years.\" As new havens are formed, existing ones offer better deals.  Mr Christensen, a former economic adviser to the Jersey government who has also worked at the then Department of Overseas Development and with Oxfam, said many of the havens were now \"locked in a desperate competition. They like to suggest that they oil the wheels of global capital but there is no case for that. What has happened is that tax havens transfer the burden of tax away from capital and towards labour and the consumer.\"  He also believes that the attraction of making money by putting it in offshore havens damaged British industry because money that could have been invested in Britain had been removed from the country.  A UN has spokesman confirmed week that Kofi Annan, the secretary general, sees the issue as a priority. \"The secretary general has indicated repeatedly that he believes money should be spent on development rather than going offshore,\" he said.  Mr Annan believes the UN has a vital role to play in tracking the money. \"The remedies have to be global and the UN is the only body able to do it,\" said Mr Christensen. \"The WTO [World Trade Organisation] has failed.\"  Tax havens have also attracted the attention of John Kerry, the US Democratic party's presidential candidate, who has indicated that if elected he will pursue the companies that hide their profits abroad. In April the US general accounting office said that 61% of US corporations paid no federal income tax in the late 90s. Tax havens contain only 1.2% of the world's population and 3% of the world's GDP, but 26% of assets and 31% of the profits of US multinationals are held there.  Almost every part of the world now has access to havens. Europeans can use established ones such as Jersey and Liechtenstein or newer ones, like Cyprus and Malta. The Asian Pacific has the Pacific islands, and Singapore, India and southern Africa have the Seychelles and Mauritius. North America has the Caribbean islands and Central America.  While a number of havens, such as the Cayman islands and Bermuda, have improved regulations, the effect of this has been, in the view of Mr Christensen, to legitimise them. \"Merely chasing out the worst havens and setting international standards for the better ones does little to address the real problems,\" he said.",

  "The news last week that US troops had refused to follow orders in Iraq was a stunning development, the first time anything like this has happened since Vietnam. It led the network news last Friday night and underlined the reckless folly of America's unilateral adventure there. <p>How can you have faith in a commander-in-chief who claims we are on the right track in Iraq, when the troops on the ground are bailing on the mission, not out of rebelliousness but because of legitimate concerns for their own safety?</p> <p>Breaking two weeks before election day, the story was a campaign gift for John Kerry, as he tries to unseat a wartime president based on the argument that he is just not up to the job.</p> <p>But Kerry did not say word one about the incident. The risk-averse contender for the White House was worried that he might be accused of supporting insubordination. Kerry didn't see an opportunity; he saw a hand grenade with the pin taken out. There was no way he was going to let it blow up in his face.</p> <p>Handled right, of course, the story could have framed a powerful indictment against Bush. According to the Pentagon, the reservists in question from the 343rd quartermaster company had served honourably up to this point. The Pentagon also confirmed their version of events, that the trucks they were driving did not have adequate protection and that making fuel deliveries is the single most dangerous combat duty in Iraq.</p> <p>Yet Kerry would not comment on the story. Like his \"too little too late\" reaction to the Swift boat attack and his kid glove approach to the Abu Ghraib scandal, Kerry was again swayed by an inner voice that says: \"Don't risk it.\" His fear of possibly scoring an own goal outweighed his instinct for the open goal.</p> <p>And it's a shame, because it could so easily have been different. Had Kerry weighed in on the troops story, it would have dominated the weekend news cycle. Instead the Sunday talk shows were still debating the nonsense over whether Kerry should have called Dick Cheney's daughter a lesbian. </p> <p>Yes, it would have been a risky strategy. The Bush team would have accused Kerry of undermining the war effort, or worse, of actively encouraging a widespread military mutiny.</p> <p>In short it would have been a shitstorm, but one in which Kerry would have ultimately prevailed by forcing the focus onto the judgment of a president who led the world's mightiest army into a war with no apparent end, without genuine allied support and without the basic tools to complete the task.</p> <p>Kerry's defensive approach on Friday allowed Bush to stay on the offensive, reclaiming the \"I'm tougher than you\" mantle with Monday's foreign policy speech. </p> <p>Focus groups have kept Kerry trained on domestic issues in the battleground states. They've told him that there are safe votes to be had in the fallout from the flu vaccine mess and fears that Bush will privatise social security.</p> <p>While domestic issues are important, this election will ultimately be decided over Iraq and which candidate will make the American people feel safer. Every day Kerry avoids this subject is a day Bush has to spin it his way.</p> <p>Bush speaks loftily about the \"transformational power of liberty\". Kerry must not let this rose-coloured attempt at a vision gloss over the reality, and again there is ample evidence available to Kerry if only he would make use of it.</p> <p>Last week Iraq's new government released the first comprehensive study of the state of its schools. The findings are disturbing. 700 schools were bombed by the US in March 2003. Thousands more fell into disrepair amid the chaos that ensued. Half of all schools in Iraq still have no sanitation facilities. A third have no drinking water. The lack of security has slowed repairs to a crawl. For the schoolchildren of Iraq, liberty is still a distant concept.</p> <p>New details are also emerging about the administration's level of self-delusion at the outset of the Iraq campaign. Days after the fall of Baghdad, the White House confidently predicted to commanders in the field that US troop levels could be reduced to about 30,000 by September 2003. They still stand at 150,000. They believed that a Nato force, including a sizeable contingent from Arab states would step in as a transitional force. </p> <p>The multinational cavalry never came. And an overstretched and under-equipped US force, including the truck drivers of the 343rd quartermaster company, are still stuck in Iraq, without any prospect of Nato relief. </p> <p>New leadership could change that reality, bring home an unwelcome army, and concentrate on the real war on terror. But John Kerry must make the case for it.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Philip James is a former senior Democratic party strategist</p>",
  "Welcome to the Wrap, Guardian Unlimited's round-up of the best of the day's papers. <p><b>RAKING OVER MPS' EXPENSES</b></p> <p>The ragbag of leads in today's papers is eclipsed by a story which is - in every sense - picture-led: Prince Harry's bust-up with a paparazzo photographer outside a Piccadilly nightclub. \"HARRY POTTY,\" splashes the Sun, delightedly. But more of that below. </p> <p>The Herald Tribune, meanwhile, has a front-page picture story showing Fidel Castro tripping over and breaking an arm and a leg. \"In Washington, a state department spokesman, asked whether the US wished the Cuban leader a speedy recovery, replied: 'No.'\"</p> <p>The broadsheets devote a large amount of space to raking over the parliamentary expense claims published for the first time yesterday. MPs can claim for travel expenses to and from Westminster and the cost of running their offices and maintaining homes in their constituency. The Mail thinks it has a scoop: \"Tony Blair has claimed GBP43,000 of public money on a constituency home he bought for just GBP30,000 ... Despite earning GBP178,000 a year, he asked Commons authorities to pay for maintenance because the house doubles as an office.\"</p> <p>But most of the papers are simply outraged by the revelation that MPs earning GBP57,485 a year can claim an average of GBP118,000 on expenses. \"This is entirely legitimate,\" says the Telegraph, \"but eyebrows will be raised by how some MPs are working the system for their benefit. Barbara Follett, the Labour MP for Stevenage, who is married to a very rich man indeed, claims GBP20,333 a year to run a flat in Soho, even though her constituency is a comfortable commute to Westminster ... The problem with featherbedding MPs with allowances and fantastic pensions is that it creates a huge disincentive to getting out of politics ... It is hardly surprising that politicians no longer resign on principle.\"</p> <p>The Guardian splashes with the news that Jack Straw, the foreign secretary, is trying to block the creation of a new crime of corporate manslaughter, while the Independent has a new twist on the Blair-Brown leadership wrangle which casts Mr Blair in a poor light. Clare Short reveals that the PM told her he would stand down before the next election if the chancellor \"threw his weight behind a plan to take Britain into the single currency\".</p> <p>When Ms Short relayed the message to Mr Brown, he said two other cabinet ministers had already told him of it. \"Gordon's answer was, firstly, that such deals were not worth talking about because previous agreements had not been kept, and, secondly, he would not contemplate recommending that we join the euro in order to advance his own position rather than advance the economic interests of the country.\"</p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Politics/commons/story/0,9061,1333196,00.html\">How the tabs of two MPs reveal different priorities</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/crime/article/0,2763,1333202,00.html\">Straw questions death at work law</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1322813,00.html\">Times: Second homes windfall</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml;sessionid=QPQWZEURDIZZ3QFIQMFSNAGAVCBQ0JVC?xml=/opinion/2004/10/22/dl2201.xml&amp;sSheet=/portal/2004/10/22/ixportal.html\">Telegraph: Professional politicians</a><br> * <a href=\"http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/politics/story.jsp?story=574853\">Independent: Blair and Brown: the real story</a></p> <p><b>VIOLENT CRIME RISING</b></p> <p>\"Britons are living in fear as violence, [word omitted] assaults and drug-fuelled gun wars rise across the nation,\" the Sun tells readers.</p> <p>Or, as the Guardian puts it: \"Although the official figures show that the fear of crime has fallen in the past year, the public still finds it hard to believe that crime overall in England and Wales has dropped sharply in recent years.\"</p> <p>Violent crime, however, was up 14% on last year and gun crime rose by 3%. The Sun mocks Hazel Blears, the home office minister, who stressed that overall recorded crime had fallen 5% in the second quarter of this year and added that \"all the big crimes that affect people - like burglary and vehicle crime - are down quite dramatically\". Ministers blamed the rise in violent crime on alcohol and \"low-level thuggery\".</p> <p>The Times picks up on a substantial increase in the number of people killed by being hit or kicked. \"More people [160] are now killed by hitting or kicking than die from shooting or strangulation combined,\" it says. \"There is the strong sense ... that this is a peculiarly British phenomenon, but still no satisfactory explanation about why this might be.\"</p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/crime/article/0,2763,1333077,00.html\">Police blame rise in violent crime on low-level thuggery</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2004491132,00.html\">Sun: Nation in fear of attacks</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/section/0,,7,00.html\">Times: A bad kicking</a></p> <p><b>KERRY TURNS TO GUNS AND BOOZE</b></p> <p>John Kerry attempted to win over the hunting fraternity yesterday with a duck-shooting session in Ohio.

  "The Democrats made a play yesterday for crucial votes from conservative middle America, depicting their candidate as a \"regular guy\" who likes nothing better than watching baseball and shooting geese. <p>In an effort to counter criticism that John Kerry is an arch-liberal out of touch with ordinary people, he was shown gun-in-hand on a shoot only hours after being pictured beer-in-hand for a ball game. </p> <p>The aim, as Mr Kerry sought votes in the key swing state of Ohio, was to show the blueblooded Massachusetts senator as a man of the people. </p> <p>Or as the senior Kerry adviser Mike McCurry said: \"We want people to have a better sense of John Kerry the guy.\" </p> <p>George Bush, meanwhile, headed for the crucial battleground state of Pennsylvania, which he has visited 14 times since March. </p> <p>The two main candidates are piling on the mileage and peppering the battleground states with appearances as they fight for the votes on which the election will turn on November 2. </p> <p>Pennsylvania has 21 votes in the electoral college, Ohio 20; 270 are needed to win. </p> <p>In Florida, the third big battlefield state, a poll by Quinnipiac University released yesterday showed President Bush leading Mr Kerry by 48% to 47%. A fortnight ago the poll gave Mr Bush a 51-44% lead. </p> <p>The Kerry camp has asked former Vice-President Al Gore to campaign today in Florida, where recounts finally gave Mr Bush the state by 537 votes, and the presidency, in 2000. </p> <p>It hopes Mr Gore, the loser then, will remind voters of the importance of turning out. Former President Bill Clinton will join the fray next week. </p> <p>But Mr Kerry was taking a break from formal campaigning yesterday when he made a hunting trip in Ohio, wearing camouflage and carrying a 12-bore shotgun. He claimed to have shot a bird, but tellingly his aides carried the quarry. </p> <p>The hunting trip was designed to speak to gun owners and members of the National Rifle Association in Ohio. Mr Gore was criticised for not doing more to woo gun owners in the state in the 2000 election. </p> <p>The NRA bought a full a page advertisement in a local paper in Youngstown, near where the hunt took place, accusing Mr Kerry of posing as a sportsman while voting against gun-owners' rights. Mr Kerry has denied the accusation, although he did vote in favour of a ban on assault weapons and a measure requiring background checks at gun shows. </p> <p>The hunting trip came after an evening of baseball, as Mr Kerry nestled in a rather cramped sofa with two aides to watch the crucial final play-off between the Boston Red Sox and their bitter rivals, the New York Yankees. The Red Sox's win, which put them in the World Series, was hailed as one of the greatest comebacks in baseball history. </p> <p>\"They're the greatest comeback team there is,\" Mr Kerry told journalists summoned to watch him watching the game and drinking beer from a bottle. </p> <p>Later yesterday the candidates were back on the stump and on the attack. </p> <p>Mr Bush criticised Mr Kerry's healthcare policy, saying in Pennsylvania that it would imply \"bigger government with higher costs\". </p> <p>Mr Kerry rebuked Mr Bush for opposing stem cell research, enlisting Dana Reeve, the widow of the Superman actor Christopher Reeve, to join him in making the case for the science. </p> <p>He said Mr Bush's opposition betrayed \"an extreme political agenda that slows instead of advances science\". </p> <p>On a broader front, the Annenberg Electoral Survey reported yesterday that since the opening of early voting in 35 states, 5% of registered voters were thought to have cast their ballots, and a further 17% were expected to vote before polling day. </p> <p>Other studies suggest the final figure could be as high as 25-30%. </p> <p>But international election monitors who visited the US in September issued a report criticising the partisan nature of American election monitoring. </p> <p>\"Partisan oversight and administration of elections is not the international norm,\" the report sponsored by the human rights group Global Exchange said, \"as it builds in the possibility for the perception of conflicts of interest. </p> <p>\"The delegation recommends that states establish independent and impartial bodies to administer, oversee, and certify elections.\" </p> <p>Today Mr Kerry is expected to deliver a speech about his Catholic faith, a strand in his life he repeatedly emphasised in last week's final TV debate. </p> <p>He is also expected to make a direct appeal to women voters, crucial to his chance of winning the election, when he speaks in Milwaukee. </p> <p>His strategists said the aim was to deliver a series of detailed policy speeches, in contrast to the broader approach of the Bush camp, and to contrast Mr Kerry's message with the president's argument that the senator was a \"bad man\", while striking a balance between \"the tactical political stuff that really keeps your supporters excited in the field and the substantive message\".</p>",
  "Britain will bear a heavy political cost for sending 850 extra troops to Iraq to back up the Americans if this leads to large numbers of civilian deaths, a former Labour minister who resigned over the war warned yesterday. <p>John Denham, a former police minister, was among a chorus of Labour MPs who lined up to warn the defence secretary, Geoff Hoon, that Britain's reputation as a \"force for good\" would be sullied as a result of the redeployment and British troops blamed if further civilian deaths occurred in Falluja. </p> <p>In a debate characterised by backbench criticism, the MP for Southampton Itchen said he accepted the decision to deploy further troops had not been politically motivated, two weeks before the US election. But he asked Mr Hoon: \"Would you accept that there is a political cost to this decision? </p> <p>\"It will be borne in part by our political party, perhaps more importantly in the big scheme of things in the standing of this country abroad, if the civilian deaths we fear turn out to be on the scale that people are worried about.\" </p> <p>That unease came from a feeling that \"while our government is willing to volunteer that political cost, when we look to our allies to take difficult political decisions _ there is very little reciprocation\". </p> <p>His warning was mirrored by Neil Gerrard, the MP for Walthamstow, who also opposed the war. He said the deployment would facilitate \"a massive American assault on Falluja\" for which claims that there would be \"minimised\" casualties were met with \"deep scepticism\". </p> <p>\"It is impossible to go into a town like Falluja with bombs and heavy armour and not cause civilian casualties on a significant scale and we are going to be blamed for that because of this deployment,\" he said. </p> <p>Richard Burden, Labour MP for Birmingham Northfield, who chairs the all-party Britain and Palestinian parliamentary group, warned that concern about Britain's close ness to the US had been \"tempered by an understanding that we understand things a bit better\". </p> <p>\"Does he understand that in the Middle East this deployment will undermine that distinction _ and our ability to be a force for good and sanity in that part of the world, particularly when our priorities on things like the Middle East peace process do not seem to be shared by our allies on the other side of the Atlantic?\" </p> <p>Reiterating deep concern about the behaviour of US troops in Iraq, the former foreign secretary Robin Cook, who also resigned over the war, asked if Mr Hoon would agree that insufficient US troops had been sent to Iraq in the first place, and added: \"What reassurances have you received from the US in return for this redeployment that this time they will listen to us as good and reliable allies when we advise them to minimise civilian casualties in Falluja, especially since as a result of this decision today we are much more likely to be held responsible for those casualties?\" </p> <p>Gordon Prentice, Labour MP for Pendle, said that many MPs were concerned about \"mission creep\", and asked what would happen if the Americans made a formal request for British troops to go into Baghdad or Falluja. </p> <p>In this \"highly unlikely event\", the matter would be referred to commanding of ficers, chiefs of staff and ministers, Mr Hoon said. </p> <p>Dennis Skinner, MP for Bolsover, said he was mirroring the views of millions of people in Britain in opposing the deployment, and asked: \"Doesn't he think that it is highly ironic that the American president and his vice-president, who both refused to face the muck and bullets in Vietnam, are now calling on British forces to bail them out?\" </p> <p>But his colleague, Geraint Davies, MP for Croydon Central, said that though he did not want George Bush re-elected, troops were now needed. \"We should not sacrifice UK and Iraqi lives just because we don't like George Bush.\" </p> <p>Paul Keetch, the Liberal Democrat defence spokesman, questioned whether it was the right time to move 850 troops, with the security situation set to worsen in the event of an assault on Falluja, during Ramadan, and in the run-up to the Iraqi elections. </p> <p>To Lib Dem fury, Mr Hoon repeated the government's charge that the Lib Dems' anti-war policy would mean Saddam Hussein was still in power in Baghdad. </p> <p>\"Given the situation today in Iraq, are the Liberal Democrats seriously saying to the family of people like Ken Bigley that they would not take action against terrorists, that they would not take the necessary action to see democratic elections taking place in Iraq?\" he asked.</p>",
  "<p>Lynton Crosby, who has masterminded John Howard's election victories in Australia, has now been recruited to direct the Tory campaign (Howard's way, October 20). I have just come back from attending to a family illness there. They don't have a national health service, but one based on health insurance. Sick people are advised to check what their insurance covers before they accept treatment. The election was going on while I was there. Central to the successful Liberal campaign were scare stories of tax increases if Labor got in. Labor's crime was to promise older pensioners the hospital treatment they need free, irrespective of the insurance they can afford.</p> <p>In Britain, such scare stories may not work. We value an NHS free for those who need it. But Conservative health spokesmen have been talking about new approaches to health funding.

  "In the run-up to war, a web diary from the Iraqi capital captured an international following as its author, writing under the pen name Salam Pax, charted the daily lives of a people caught between a feared regime and a foreign invasion force. Now, as America prepares for its most important election of recent times, Salam Pax journeys for the first time to the city where the decision for war was taken <p> Battleground states are getting all the action: it is too late in the campaign for candidates to go to states where it is clear what the outcome will be. And here in DC - where no candidates speak and no rallies fill the streets - the closest I get to anything resembling election activism is being asked in the street whether I want to help Kerry win. I don't know, do I? </p> <p>You see, it is really difficult. On the one hand it is really not fair for Kerry to have to clean up the mess Bush created: you break it, you buy it. Simple. But can you imagine what might happen if Bush gets properly elected this time and he goes on another American adventure?</p> <p>The closest I am going to get to a campaign speech is listening to Al Gore at Georgetown University today. I get to wave my press pass around and leapfrog the long line of people who want to go in.</p> <p>I don't think people go to these things to get informed or hear other points of view; most come to reassure themselves that they are not alone in what they think is right. There are lots of Kerry badges and T-shirts. It would have been interesting to see what would have happened if someone had shown up with a Bush button.</p> <p>The speech was good. We laughed, we cried and we cheered at all the right places. I was warned beforehand by a Democrat that Gore might get a bit too excited during his speeches; to watch out for him screaming and pacing about the stage. </p> <p>I would have suggested some paper tissues: the poor guy was sweating rivers under those lights and at one point he had to wipe a runny nose with the sleeves of his suit. Oh, and could someone also tell him his hair is fine? He should stop touching it every couple of minutes.</p> <p>What was the speech about? Who cares. Are you going to be one of those bores who tell me this is supposed to be about substance? Well, if you insist: George Bush is not stupid; he is Evil. (Gore used more words. Politicians, you know.)</p> <p>Actually, that is quite a good point to make: dismissing Bush as someone who \"does not have the normal, active curiosity about separating fact from myth\" or as a born-again Christian who \"relies on religious faith in place of logical analysis\" makes him less dangerous. It makes him too easy to dismiss and underestimate. It's like that comedy show I was watching the other day where the presenter asked the viewers to go and vote Republican because having Bush as president he made his job so easy, and also, \"Where else are you going to channel all the hate?\"</p> <p>Gore dismissed both those views as \"cartoon images\" and added: \"I am convinced that the president's frequent departures from fact-based analysis have much more to do with rightwing political and economic ideology than the Bible. \"Most of the problems president Bush has caused for this country stem not from his belief in God but from his belief in the infallibility of the rightwing Republican ideology . . . it is love of power for its own sake that is the original sin of this administration.\"</p> <p>Bottom line: Bush is not stupid; he is Evil. I told you so 180 words ago but you had to have the long explanation. And stop buying those \"Bush-isms\" books.</p> <p>Later . . .</p> <p> My next appointment is with an ex-CIA man who has known Iraq intimately for a very long time and unlike Judith Yaphe, the Iraq expert I met a couple of days ago, has been to Baghdad quite often, including after the war. </p> <p>He doesn't work for the agency any more, but then, do you really ever stop working for it? I cannot, of course, reveal his name to you: I could, but then I would have to kill you. He works in the \"private sector\" now. That's all I can say.</p> <p>Oh, well, it is Whitley Bruner. He arrives disappointingly free of gadgets and without a sexy woman in high heels draped over his arms. There go my James Bond dreams. So, Mr secret agent man, why was the human intelligence on the situation in Iraq so bad? How did your guys get it so wrong? </p> <p>\"The intelligence wasn't wrong on what would happen at all. This was Chalabi telling the administration that the Iraqi people would be throwing flowers and welcoming the Americans.\" Hmm, again flowers and Chalabi, the Iraqi exile the Americans first tried to install as Iraq's new leader. </p> <p>\"The established wisdom in the state department, intelligence community and the Future of Iraq project was that we had between three and six months after the end of the war before an Iraqi revolt. This is the time you had to get things going nicely for the Iraqis before they turn against you.\"</p> <p>The state department had, through its Future of Iraq project, detailed plans on how to proceed. There were plans for all the ministries. Months were spent preparing reports that once they reached the Pentagon ended up in the waste basket. Chalabi was in; everybody else was out. It really is strange how often his name comes up when people start talking about Why Things Went Wrong.</p> <p>The first time I heard of Bruner was when I was working as a translator for the New York Times. One of their reporters was working on a story that explained why so many Iraqis who used to be in the army were talking of treason on the highest levels. </p> <p>Apparently there were people in the western desert before the war and there were contacts made with high-level Iraqi army officials - but \"the basic message from the agency was: 'Go home. Drop your weapons until it gets to be time, and then come back.' And that is why the dissolution of the military was such a big mistake.\" </p> <p>The Americans did not keep their part of the deal. When Paul Bremer, the US administrator in Iraq, decided to get rid of the Iraqi defence ministry, 400,000 people ended up jobless and angry.</p> <p>The other mistake made by Washington and the coalition provisional authority at the time in Baghdad was the formation of the governing council: \"This was the consolidation of the rule of the exiles; it is the internals we need.\" I find it just way too unbelievable that this man knows Iraq so well - not just Iraq before Saddam but Iraq now - and yet nobody is listening to him. His is not just knowledge from reports but a deep understanding of all the complexities of the situation.</p> <p>We talk for more than two hours. I am really amazed by the depth of Bruner's knowledge and just want to listen, and I forget to ask him if he had dinner and whether we should have something to eat. I hope he forgives me.</p> <p>When we talk about possible Iraqi elections in January, he doesn't sound very optimistic. He doesn't see it happening because, to start with, there are no internal parties; only the exiles are ready. Actually, the religious parties are ready as well, and this is something not many people have considered. What would the US government do if we had elections and we in Iraq choose someone like Sadr - or even Ayatollah Sistani? </p> <p>\"Nobody is really certain about what they [the US] will do. They will look at it. This is obviously a major problem,\" Bruner says. He has the impression that that file is not going to be opened until after America's November 2 election. \"Nobody is addressing this issue yet. Luckily, there is still time.\"</p> <p>Another thing that seems to bother Bruner is that the US does not seem to have an exit strategy. \"One thing you have to start doing is defining the goals very clearly and defining a timeline, a timeline for when we are out,\" he says.</p> <p>John Kerry seems to be going in that direction by at least stating very clearly that the US is not in Iraq to stay - not there for the bases, not there for the oil. Iraqis need to know that, and Bruner is very correct when he says that unlike, say, Germany, Iraq is not a place for long-term American military bases. \"That ain't going to happen,\" says: Iraqi nationalism is way too strong.\"</p> <p>We talked about many, many issues, and although the picture Bruner drew was bleak at least he knew where the limits were and what had to be done. There is no way the Bush administration can get away with the mess it created in Iraq by saying it did not know and could not predict this, because for two hours I sat with a man who was so knowledgeable on things I thought no one in the west knew or cared about. It is a shame he is now in the \"private sector\". But then, does anyone really leave the agency?</p>",
  "My last day in Washington, and I have only one appointment - I am meeting Laurie Mylroie. <p>I start warming up to the idea of our encounter when google comes up with an article titled \"Laurie Mylroie: The neocons' favorite conspiracy theorist\". Fact or fiction, this was reason enough for me.</p> <p>We meet at the Savoy hotel, and this is when I enter the twilight zone. Mylorie is described on a PR website as an Iraq and terrorism expert. She has published several books on Saddam and his relationship to terrorist networks, and has been was embraced by the American Enterprise Institute. Will she cut me up to thin slices and serve as appetiser at a dinner party? </p> <p>She strongly believes Saddam was behind every terrorist attack on US interests in the past decade, a man at the heart of the war on America. And she has many friends who listen to her.</p> <p>When she shows up, I do not know what to make of her. She is restless, and chain-smokes. When we order our coffees, she starts stacking up the little cream cups in a tower and then rearranges them back on the saucer they came in. This is definitely not \"fierce\". It is actually a bit disappointing.</p> <p>We talk about her theory linking Iraq to the 9/11 attacks, and she goes on a long-winded explanation. Interested? Look at <a href=\"http://www.benadorassociates.com/article/6172&quot;\">this</a>. For me, it was too complicated to follow, and worthy of two X-files episodes. I phased out while watching her rip the little sweetener packet to smaller and smaller pieces.</p> <p>I wake up when she mentions Dick Cheney. She seems to really like America's vice-president. \"Cheney is a very big man, not in the physical sense,\" she says. Thanks for the clarification.</p> <p>If it were up to her, Saddam would have been dealt with much earlier. President Clinton's Desert Fox attacks on Iraq were, she says, \"a weak and pathetic response which, in my view, encapsulates the inability of much of the American elite to understand a danger like Saddam\".</p> <p>But what I find really hard to understand is when she tells me that the Bush administration refused to use her arguments to justify the war on Iraq. You would have thought Mylorie's theory was heaven-sent to this administration, but no. Apparently, they \"wouldn't touch the thing\". And when I ask again, telling her this reluctance looks strange, she talks about \"bureaucratic obstructions\". </p> <p>So, Dr Mylroie, is the world a safer place now that we are rid of Saddam? Apparently not. \"The war isn't over - many mistakes were made.\" Dear, oh dear. </p> <p>Now the seven days in Washington are over, one of the few things that seems clear to me is that even people in the know have no idea where to go next on Iraq, but everyone agrees mistakes have been made. Not much of a consolation.</p> <p>On my way out of the US, I have to go to the office of border protection again to get my passport stamped. I do my \"I believe we should work with the Americans\" spiel, but with less conviction than I usually do. The Americans I want to work with seem to be excluded - all they can do is wring their hands and say: \"We tried to tell them.\" </p> <p>Would John Kerry bring those people back into the game? Does that even matter now? Is it already too late?</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Salam Pax is author of The Baghdad Blog, a Guardian book published by Atlantic.</p>",
  "I really don't like my passport: it is too big and has a colour that reminds you of something that has been sitting for too long in your fridge. But what I hate most about it is that when an immigration officer takes a look at it they will usually ask me to step aside and follow them into a small room. <p>Everybody in the airport immigration queue at JFK in New York already hates me because it is taking too long, and now that I am being led away like this it makes everyone look at me as if I have just threatened to assassinate their favourite cartoon character.</p> <p>This is the moment where, in a perfect world modelled on Bollywood movies, I would break into song and dance; my chorus boys would be the beautiful boys in turbans and beards brandishing their \"axis of evil\" passports and I would look as fabulous as Kylie Minogue while singing: \"What do I have to do to get the message thru? I am Iraqi, Iraqi!\" It would be a hit with everyone at the airport and I would be escorted by adoring fans to the limousine waiting outside</p> <p>But this is not a Bollywood movie and I am being taken to a \"secondary screening\". My first visit to the USA might just end up with me being shackled and sent to a very unpleasant place where the colour orange is the height of fashion.</p> <p>Mind you, a friendly soul at this paper's office did offer comforting words: if I ever did end up in Guant\u00e1namo Bay they would just change my title to the Guant\u00e1namo Blogger, he said, promising that they would still be interested. Thanks. My only worry is, I don't think orange is a colour that suits my complexion.</p> <p>The immigration officer led me to a room on the side where four officers were sitting on a very high podium joking about some guy they didn't like, and one of them was shouting, \"Deport him, deport him!\" </p> <p>I smile: it's tough trying not to look nervous when you are in front of a panel of four archangels who will decide whether you deserve to enter paradise. I am handed a piece of paper to fill out. I am relieved it does not ask me to list my sins on this earth. Meanwhile, more non-whiteys are arriving and filling out forms. I feel a bit more relaxed among my fellow exiles from the ranks of normal people. We are special: we are all from Muslim countries.</p> <p>When my turn comes to step up to the podium for the archangels to question my reasons for entering this land of dreams, this heaven on earth, I get asked a question that will trouble me for a long time after the interview is over: \"Sir, are you religious?\" </p> <p>Now, I am the type of Muslim who would tell you that even if there was an Allah hovering up there, he should be punished by collective disobedience because he has been doing a miserable job. </p> <p>So the answer to Mr Immigration Officer would be a hearty: \"Oh, no. I dropped that potato a long time ago.\" But instead I keep looking at the little cross hanging from his neck and feel like telling him that this is none of his business. But I don't. We all know why he is asking me this question and what my answer should be: \"No, sir, I am not religious and I do not know how to prove that to you.\" I feel ashamed that I have just said these words.</p> <p>No time to dwell on that. I have another flight to catch to Washington and I am so tired I will fall asleep standing if I don't keep moving. I vaguely remember staring for too long at a huge wall full of magazines and newspapers and wondering: who has the time to read all that? I bought everything that had the word Iraq on the cover.</p> <p>Next thing, I am standing in line to board a small plane to Washington DC. There is something strangely familiar in this setup; I am just not sure what it is until I am asked to spread my legs and lift my arms. By Allah, this is like going into the green zone in Baghdad, only everyone is so friendly. That's what is different: they smile and say, \"Have a nice day\" after they pat you down, but it is the basic green zone experience. Kind of makes you homesick. </p> <p>On the flight we are instructed not to stand up from our seats once we get within 30 minutes of Washington; otherwise we will not be allowed to land. Too much weirdness, and I haven't even landed yet. I fall asleep in the taxi to the hotel, in Georgetown.</p> <p>Day one</p> <p>First thought this morning was: what am I doing here? Why am I in Washington? If word gets out I will end up on two wanted lists: my cousins', because they will all want presents from DC, and the list of my friendly neighbourhood kidnap gang back in Baghdad. If you ask their opinion, I am at the heart of darkness; I am Halal meat; head does not belong where it is now and all that. </p> <p>I have no plan. My \"to do\" list has only two items on it: 1. Panic. 2. Think about food. (The first does not rule out the second under Pax logic.) There is enough time for the first item, but I wake up too late for breakfast in the hotel and I have to go out. I get myself a kids' tourist map (the only one they had at the hotel: the treasury department is an Uncle Sam throwing money around) and go to the nearest bagel place. I am officially a bagel fan now.</p> <p>My big bagel is full of eggs that come out of a milk carton (I kid you not - and already beaten, too. They must have such clever hens here. I am flabbergasted) and smoked bacon. (All future immigration officers are to refer to this: I am not religious - I eat forbidden meat). </p> <p>Munching on this feast of strange and forbidden food I decide to do a pilgrimage to the White House, taking my cues from a religion I have betrayed publicly just so that I can get into this land; to walk around this shrine to freedom and democracy seven times, kiss the black stone, then throw seven stones at the pillar of evil and run between the two mounds of Safa and Marwa seven times, the whole thing minus the white robe but plus baseball cap. There was one small detour: my map showed a place called Foggy Bottom - and I had to see what a foggy bottom looked like.</p> <p>It didn't work out as well as I thought it would. To start with, the Foggy Bottom detour was a waste of time. It seems the gods here don't think much of circumambulation rituals: you can't walk around the White House. So I just stood there and gawked. </p> <p>While I was meditating on the whiteness of the White House, four American soldiers wearing desert fatigues came and joined the gawkers, and the only thing I could think of was how much I missed home. I mean, how sad is that: I see soldiers in combat fatigues and go all gooey, like ET wanting to go home. No prizes for identifying what's wrong with this picture.</p> <p>Since walking around the White house was out of the question, I thought maybe I'd go inside to find a black stone to kiss, the next step in this, my pilgrimage to the capital that wants to bring freedom and democracy to the malnourished, undereducated third world. </p> <p>I locate a guard and ask about White House tours. She tells me these have to be arranged through my senator. Oh, shucks. Now, how am I going to get in touch with John D Negroponte all the way back in the US ambassador's dugout in Baghdad?</p> <p>Throwing stones at the pillar of evil also had to be abandoned because I don't think anyone here will find an Iraqi throwing seven pebbles at the Washington Monument amusing. Only one ritual remains; running between the Safa and Marwa mounds. The Mall seems the place to do that, and I finally get a sign: the ground is spattered with Run Against Bush stickers. So what else to do but run?</p> <p>Later</p> <p>Tonight is the last presidential debate and the New York Yankees are playing against the Boston Red Sox, which is probably equally important. I was invited to watch both with a group of young Democrats. I was promised red wine, crunchy munchies and a crash course in baseball and the art of presidential debates - two reasons why America is such a great nation, I am told. </p> <p>Two TVs ensured that you missed nothing, and a big bowl of lollipops ensured the sugar levels stayed high. There was so much juicy gossip it was hard to pay much attention to the debate. Did you hear the one about George Bush being intimate with Condoleezza Rice? Apparently she has told some reporter she really enjoys solving crossword puzzles with the president. Wink wink, nudge nudge.</p> <p>Ultimately, the conversation turns to Iraq. We all seem to agree that even if John Kerry gets elected as president it is too late for a drastic change in policy. I am surprised at how much everyone here seems to have bought what the Bush administration has been selling them - especially the line about a well-educated Iraqi middle class that will take over and transform Iraq into a democratic paradise. </p> <p>To tell you the truth, I bought into that as well - and boy were we wrong. That educated middle class was everywhere around the world, but not in Iraq. What it decided to do was to shut its mouth or turn religious. </p> <p>And that is another thing that seemed to be incomprehensible to one of my new Washington friends: when we were talking about the popularity of the clerical militia chief Moqtada al-Sadr I was asked how anyone could be fooled by someone who so obviously used religion to boost his own popularity and went for the lowest common denominator for popular appeal? I was saved by another guest who asked if we were talking about Bush or Sadr here.</p> <p>So how did the crash course in baseball and presidential debate go? Baseball: you hit the ball and run. Politics: never admit you made a mistake, so . . . hit the ball and run, I guess.</p>",
  "Viktor Yushchenko sits in front of the dressing room mirror as a make-up artist applies a heavy-duty fixing spray and foundation to his skin. <p>He's joking with his entourage, but his face still bears pockmarks of an unexplained illness that lasted for weeks, and may prove to be the deciding factor in a rough and tumble election that has been punctuated by claims of dirty tricks.</p> <p>\"I want to get back the face that 40 million Ukrainians recognise,\" Yushchenko told the Guardian. \"I have got back into normal campaigning in the last week and feel my health is restored\".</p> <p>It could be too late for the opposition candidate.

We don't vote here to make life better, but to stop it from getting worse.\"</p> <p>There are nine days to go until Ukraine votes in its fourth presidential elections, with the winner succeeding Kuchma, an authoritarian politician who has dominated Europe's largest country and the EU's new neighbour.</p> <p>Yushchenko is the pro-western liberal opposition candidate, a former prime minister who claims to want to wipe away the corruption and cobwebs of the Soviet era, completing Ukraine's slow turn towards Europe.</p> <p>Yanukovich is the Russian-backed successor to Kuchma, described by one senior western diplomat as \"a disciplinarian, a tough guy\".</p> <p>The two candidates have much in common: they both served in Kuchma's regime, and now both have backing from former cold war adversaries.</p> <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin has swung behind Yanukovich, inviting him to Moscow, and promising to visit Kiev three days before the vote.</p> <p>Pro-Putin political strategists are also advising his campaign. Washington, though, has tacitly backed Yushchenko, condemning the state abuse of the media to skew the playing field, and sending heavyweights - including George Bush senior and Henry Kissinger - to urge a democratic election.</p> <p>The Yushchenko campaign has repeatedly complained that it has been barred from access to state TV and has had to rely on Yushchenko attending election rallies to garner support.</p> <p>The issue of Yushchenko's illness is still pivotal to the election, and frustration among voters over the conduct of the campaign may yet result in demonstrations as polling day draws near.</p> <p>No evidence has been provided to show that Yushchenko was poisoned, and one western diplomat admitted \"his campaign handled the issue really badly\".</p> <p>Mikhail Pogribinski, a political analyst and government adviser, said: \"I think Yushchenko fell ill and his staff decided to make something out of it. It's unlikely there will be mass protests unless the results seriously conflict with the [variety of planned] exit polls.\"</p> <p>However, there are signs that a protest movement is building momentum.</p> <p>On Friday last week 15 pro-Yushchenko activists from a group called Pora were arrested by police, who claimed to have found a grenade. In response, other Yushchenko supporters have begun demonstrating outside the interior ministry.</p> <p>Vladislav Kaskil, a senior coordinator or Pora, said: \"We can already say that these elections have not been democratic.\" He said the group had 15,000 members, and only peaceful intentions, but was set on change.</p> <p>\"We [in Ukraine] have the biggest experience of peaceful protest in all of Europe. This is our only opportunity and Ukrainian citizens will be to blame if we cannot use this chance to bring about democracy.\"</p> <p>To many voters, talk of a high noon showdown between east and west is all bluster. \"I don't believe anyone\", said Andrei, 18, considering his first vote at an election stall promoting a minor candidate.</p> <p>\"I won't vote at all. At least it won't be Kuchma, but Yanukovich and Yushchenko will both be bad all the same.\" He shrugs, putting his headphones back in his ears as he walks away.</p> <p>\"I will vote for the youth\", said Grigori Parkhomenko, an engineer driving his wife and son to work and school.</p> <p>\"This means Yushchenko.

  "By his own admission, Frank Chapple, the electricians' trade union leader from 1966 to 1984, who has died aged 83, was \"an awkward bugger\"; he relished this self-mocking description, delivering it with glee to any available audience, critical or friendly. Invariably it was accompanied with an impish grin that spread slowly across his broad, oval, slightly Italianate features. <p>It was a perfectly accurate label. It was also a form of protective psychological armour helping to conceal the much more sensitive, shrewdly intelligent, courageous and often complex character that lay behind the controlled jauntiness of the Chapple carapace.</p> <p>Almost every major event in his life, certainly as a union official, came in a sequence of rapid learning curves. Initially, it was a slowly maturing awareness that the world was a complex place requiring at least as much cunning as idealism. It was like that when he first became a Communist at the age of 17 - in a sudden flash of insight about the injustices of life - followed, ultimately, by an awareness that the party was just as full of imperfections, even wickedness, as the rest of life.</p> <p>It was like that again when he ceased to be a Communist party member in 1959 - with a flash of realisation about the deceit and intellectual corruption within the party he had lived with, and defended, for 20 years.</p> <p>Eventually it fell to him, under the guidance and original leadership of the late Sir Leslie Cannon, to drive the communists out of the old Electrical Trades Union (ETU), which, through mergers, became part of the Electrical, Electronic, Telecommunication and Plumbing Trades Union (EETPU) in 1968, the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union (AEEU) in 1992, and Amicus in 2003. Chapple continued the crusade, launched by Cannon, that effectively eroded Communist party power and influence in Britain's postwar trade union movement.</p> <p>It was a remarkable moment and a distinctive political watershed. Indeed, the British Communist party itself never really recovered from the scandal of the ETU ballot-rigging case in 1961. And if the principal instrument of that political, and industrial, transformation was Cannon, it was Chapple who consolidated and completed Cannon's work when he succeeded to the ETU leadership on Cannon's death in 1970.</p> <p>The High Court judgment condemning the former Communist leadership of the ETU of ballot-rigging on a massive scale was, and remains, a historic and grim landmark in British trade unionism. By the same token, it became Chapple's platform for the rest of his career.</p> <p>Chapple was born in the slum area of Hoxton, east London, in a flat above his father's shoe-repair shop. There was no bath or running hot water in the Chapple home. Like everyone else in the area, he used the public baths. When he was demobbed from the army in 1947, he had already married Joan Nicholls while on leave the previous year, and their first home together in Stamford Hill still had no bath. Chapple maintained that he did not have a properly plumbed bath at home until he was 42.</p> <p>His father was, in Frank's words, \"a bit of a villain\" who had been invalided out of the army in the first world war after a severe leg injury. Chapple senior could neither read nor write, and rented his shop from his in-laws. It was Frank's mother who was his guiding star, intelligent, and ambitious for her son.She made no bones about voting Tory, though this had no apparent impact on young Frank, whose views and emotions were far more conditioned by his surroundings, his school chums and especially a dedicated headmaster at the local elementary school. Chapple was also growing up amid the anti-fascist demonstrations and battles in the East End.</p> <p>After leaving school at 14, he found a job as an errand boy with an electrical firm. By pure chance, he was then taken on as an unindentured apprentice electrician with another firm which was doing \"some wiring\" at his uncle's greengrocer's shop. This was where he first encountered the world of trade unionism.</p> <p>At 16 he applied for membership of one of the technicians' unions, but he was turned down because unemployment was chronic, and most unions were then putting restrictions on new members. Chapple was finally accepted into the ETU and quickly absorbed into the activities of the Islington branch which, effectively, was run by a group of active communists. He had previously joined the Labour League of Youth (LLY) in Shoreditch, where he met a young writer named Ted Willis - later a fellow peer - who was also the organisation's national chairman. But the LLY and Willis were already in trouble with Labour party headquarters because of their Popular Front activities during the Spanish Civil War. So, in 1939, Willis took a batch of his Labour Youth members over to the Young Communist League - and Frank Chapple went with him: it was Chapple's initiation into the Communist party.</p> <p>With the outbreak of the second world war, Chapple, as an electrician, was recruited for work in the Royal Ordnance Factories, where he encountered his first strike. It was also where he developed into a militant Communist activist, remaining in ROF work until his call-up in 1943.</p> <p>Eventually he was drafted into a Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers unit as a maintenance electrician, and was later involved in the Normandy landings from D-day plus 20, where his special skills were devoted to maintaining tanks. In the advance into Germany, Chapple was mentioned in dispatches - albeit, as he would confess with a dismissive wave, simply for repairing the brigadier's car after a breakdown.</p> <p>Once in Germany, Private Chapple quickly established contact with the emerging German Communist party and helped to run a communist cell in the army education centre at L\u00fcbeck. Demobbed in 1947 and without work, he resumed activities in the ETU and was awarded a trip to Prague as one of its representatives at a conference of the Communist-run World Federation of Democratic Youth, where his co-delegate was another dedicated young communist, Leslie Cannon.</p> <p>For the next few years, Chapple moved from job to job, accompanied by frequent spells of unemployment, though he never allowed such interruptions to interfere with his activity in the union. He stood as a Communist candidate at a local election in Shoreditch, but was heavily defeated. The period around 1950 was one of undiminishing enthusiasm for the party, and, inevitably, Chapple's union activities brought him to the notice of ETU leaders.</p> <p>His inaugural attendance at the union's annual conference in 1949 was expected to become a launch-pad for a full-time post or a seat on the union's executive. Instead, it was the beginning of trouble. Chapple started to question and criticise communist tactics inside the ETU and even raise doubts about some aspects of Soviet policies. He was rapped for such disloyalty, and reminded that his duty was to be a good communist. Yet despite these difficulties, he was elected to the union executive in 1957, though his term was limited, by rule change, to two years. This bitter experience led him to conclude that his Communist party membership was doomed.</p> <p>In 1959, even before he was voted off the union executive, he left it to join the Labour party. By then he was linked with Cannon and the union's Reform Group as the opening shots were fired to dislodge the union's communist leadership. From that point through to the high court trial, Chapple worked with Cannon - albeit as second fiddle, frequently stifling his irritation with Cannon's autocratic behaviour. Yet both knew they had to stick together against their common foe.</p> <p>All else flowed from Mr Justice Winn's verdict; the judge decided that the genuine winner in an election for general secretary was a Glasgow Catholic, Jock Byrne, and not the communist Frank Haxell. With that crucial ruling, the entire communist leadership was effectively cast into the wilderness. The union's rule book was changed, banning communists from office, and the entire structure transformed.</p> <p>Cannon became ETU president in 1963. Chapple then followed Byrne into the general secretary's post in 1966. He later merged the posts of president and general secretary into a single role, which he occupied after Cannon's death.</p> <p>From 1966 until 1970 he was the union's representative on the Labour Party national executive - and rarely allowed the Labour leadership under Harold Wilson to forget his reputation for cussedness. Chapple was a fervent critic of Wilson's attempts to curb pay rises and introduce incomes policies; for Chapple, the interests of his rank-and-file members almost always took precedence.</p> <p>From 1970, as a member of the Trades Union Congress general council, Chapple continued to be the arch-critic. He was particularly opposed to what he regarded as a leftward shift by the TUC in opposition to the Heath government's industrial relations reforms. He opposed the Days of Action (protest strike days) called by the TUC, making it clear that he would prefer to work with the Heath measures \"to prove that they are unworkable\". This led to him falling out with most of his TUC colleagues, including the then general secretary, Vic Feather.</p> <p>With Margaret Thatcher's election victory in 1979, Chapple's relationship with the Labour party became increasingly tense. He finally lost patience with the turmoil inside Labour, especially with Tony Benn's influence in the early 1980s, and was a founder signatory of the Limehouse Declaration creating the breakaway Social Democratic Party (SDP) in 1981. Chapple also backed MPs who broke with the Labour Party - notably the late John Grant, member for Islington Central, who joined the SDP.</p> <p>The irony in all this was that, by seniority, Chapple was moving up to become TUC president. There was a clear bid to stop him when, in 1980, he was voted off the TUC's senior committee amid cries of \"traitor\" from other union leaders. But a year later he was restored to this key committee after Len Murray pleaded for a sense of reason and justice. There was even more irony in this, since Chapple had never approved of Murray's leadership as TUC general secretary.</p> <p>The whole bizarre business was finally resolved when the TUC accepted Chapple's seniority and grudgingly elected him as their president in 1982. His presidential speech at the 1983 Congress was pure Chapple chutzpah - he attacked his trade union colleagues for their weaknesses, their leftwing tendencies, their undemocratic practices; not much was left out of his swipe at virtually everybody and everything in the TUC establishment. It was a gigantic piece of nerve and courage and, no doubt in many minds, sheer egocentric self-indulgence.</p> <p> C happle retired from his union leadership shortly after his TUC presidency; yet he never yielded his platform as scourge of the left. It had become his stock in trade, perhaps even an obsession, and the theme expected of him. Thatcher - whom Chapple admired - made him a life peer in 1985, and he served on a number of industrial committees and boards. Yet his retirement years were mostly given over to his lifelong hobby - breeding racing pigeons, which had fascinated him from childhood. He spent much time reading history and classical literature - he could quote from tracts from Shelley - and listening to classical music.</p> <p>Chapple's autobiography, Sparks Fly! (1984) remains a fascinating read - though it does not quote one of his fondest aphorisms - Arthur Balfour's melancholic view that: \"Nothing in the world matters very much and very little matters at all.\" It is hard to accept that the \"awkward bugger\" really believed that.</p> <p>His first wife died in 1994; he is survived by their two sons, Roger and Barry, and by his second wife, Phyllis Luck, whom he married in 1999.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Frank Chapple, Lord Chapple of Hoxton, trade union leader, born August 8 1921; died October 19 2004</p>"
