  "I'm writing from California, where the presidential election is mainly a rumour, fed by cable news. Poor souls, we see only the barrage of television ads that now constitute the bulk of a modern campaign when they're excerpted on the news broadcasts - which they increasingly are. In one of this campaign's novel twists, many adverts are now made only to be 'released' to the internet in the hope of garnering free news coverage. <p>In the 1950s, fear-mongering critics foresaw a dystopian future in which political leaders would be 'sold like soap'. They were risibly wrong. Soap advertising rarely stoops to the level on which American political advertising, with its creepy background music, grotesque slo-mo footage and fear-inducing voice-over announcers, lives. </p> <p>California is on the outside looking in because this state is overwhelmingly pro-Kerry. The polls say so. And so we suffer our lack of inundation, due to this odd confluence of a political antique and the latest technology. The antique is the Electoral College, which distributes votes for president state-by-state, and its accompanying state legislation which, with a couple of exceptions, apportions those votes on a winner-take-all basis. The latest technology, gleaned from advertising, dictates that you focus only on likely prospects. In California, long since relegated to the Kerry column, there are none. A California Bush voter is, in effect, a wasted Bush voter. So for us, as for you, this excruciating year has been, aside from the fundraising, mainly a spectator sport. </p> <p>The local newspaper printed an opinion piece last Sunday about the man whom a recent book identified as 'Bush's Brain', Karl Rove. Liberal writer Neal Gabler offered the most dire interpretation of Rove's baleful influence on politics - even calling him, at one point, Machiavellian. Well, excuse the hell out of me. I thought this was a contest about life-and-death issues, the war, global warming, the future of the world's most conventionally powerful nation - you know, stuff like that. If you really wanted to win such a campaign, gosh, maybe you'd even like the operation to be run by someone Machiavellian. After all, if the toilet stops up, I call the plumber. </p> <p>Liberals, of the Hollywood variety particularly, evince the most exquisite dismay at the ruthless and unethical behaviour of the likes of Rove. Then they go back to chuckling indulgently at the less ethical, and less explicable, behaviour of the often-feral agents and producers in their own midst. At least Rove has the good manners not to behave like a spoilt three-year-old who's been kept up two hours past his bedtime. </p> <p>Democrats generally revel in the conceit that they're smarter than their opponents, while Republicans assure themselves they're more moral than the other guys. But, Bush is not the idiot liberals like to think. He's got a kind of reptilian cunning, and Rove taps right into that political lizard brain. Combined with fervid Methodism, you've got ruthless certainty. Bush also has excellent speech writers, and knows how to stick to the script. </p> <p>Kerry's way of vaulting over the threshold issue - are you tough enough? - has been to proffer his Vietnam resum\u00e9. When it was savaged by the Swift Boats for Truth ads, he spent the first three weeks of August not defending his own military record. When asked about this strategy, Kerry said his advisers wouldn't let him. </p> <p>The senator also has his own savant, a seven-time loser (in presidential campaigns) named Robert Shrum. His signature is a sort of throwback populism. In a recent New York Times Magazine article, Shrum was asked why the Kerry campaign was ignoring the centrepiece of his Senate career, a tough investigation that led to the closing down of BCCI, an international bank with drug cartel and - how's this for relevance? - terrorism connections. Shrum's answer: it's too complex for 'them'. Populism in action. So, Kerry's senatorial life is a self-defined black hole. Fortunately for him, there are no Machiavellians around to define it in more sinister terms. </p> <p>Bill Clinton has been brought in to 'make the sale' for Kerry. Arnold Schwarzenegger is doing similar last-minute work for Bush. How do you like your testosterone: straight, or mixed with steroids? </p> <p>One can excuse the still undecided for thinking this election boils down to a simple question: after the funeral, whom would you rather hang out with, the preacher or the mortician? </p> <p>For me, it's also a simple question. Bush has run a disastrous war. Kerry has run a feckless campaign. On Tuesday, the American people can punish only one of them. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Actor and writer Harry Shearer voices Mr Burns and Smithers, among others, in The Simpsons.

  "<b>ABORTION</b> <br> <b>Countdown starts for Roe v Wade</b> <p>Dorothy Fadiman was a graduate student at Stanford University when she became pregnant, and begged her gynaecologist for an abortion. When he said he couldn't do it, she 'found a branch of the Mafia, paid someone $600 cash, and had a blindfolded, unanaesthetised abortion from a stranger'. The operation went so badly that, she remembers, 'the same gynaecologist who would not give me a safe abortion came to the intensive care ward and saved my life'. </p> <p>The year was 1961. In 1973, in the landmark Supreme Court ruling known as Roe v Wade, abortion was made legal in the US. It is now estimated that about one in three American women will have had an abortion by the age of 45. But the ability of individual states to impose restrictions on women's access to safe abortions has been gradually expanded since 1973. </p> <p>Now more than half the 50 states require parental notification for minors, and many states impose a waiting period and restrict public funding or insurance coverage - a situation which means that, in the words of one clinic director in Alabama, 'for young women and poor women, the desperation is already here'. Because they receive federal funds, US military hospitals abroad are not allowed to perform abortions on servicewomen or the wives of servicemen. </p> <p>Roe v Wade is currently upheld in the Supreme Court by a slim margin of 5-4. Since it is one of the longest-serving Supreme Courts in US history, the next President is expected to appoint one or more Supreme Court justices. Depending on who they are, and who retires, a woman's right to choose may be severely threatened. George Bush has said he is not in favour of a 'litmus test' which would force a judge to outline his or her position on abortion beforehand. John Kerry stands by the constitutional right to choose, and has outraged his fellow Roman Catholics by stating that the decision is 'between a woman, God and her doctor'. </p> <p>The hottest topic due to appear before the Supreme Court on this issue is the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. It was first introduced in 1995, vetoed by President Clinton, and recently passed into law by President Bush. Three district judges declared the ban unconstitutional, and it is now on appeal. </p> <p>The ban refers to a procedure dubbed 'partial-birth abortion' by anti-abortionists. Medically termed 'dilation and extraction' (D&amp;X), it involves partially delivering a second-trimester foetus before puncturing the skull and suctioning the contents before final delivery. It is used very rarely, but because of its apparent brutality the pro-life movement has found an emotional argument. 'From a PR standpoint, it's a winning issue for them,' says Steven Emmert, of the National Coalition of Abortion Providers. 'When they created the term \"partial-birth abortion\" they won the PR war.' </p> <p>'D&amp;X' first came to national attention in 1992, when Dr Martin Haskell, a physician in Cincinnati, Ohio, gave a paper on it. He and other doctors had begun to use the procedure when aborting foetuses with severe birth defects (undetected before 20 weeks), because doctors needed an 'intact' foetus to be able to advise parents whether future children were at risk. </p> <p>The banning of a specific procedure is unprecedented but, as Carol Tobias, political director of the National Right to Life Committee, puts it, 'we think if we want to protect unborn children we have to take it one step at a time'. </p> <p>Though there may now seem little to defend about D&amp;X as opposed to other methods, the ban is seen by the pro-choice movement as a symbolic step towards overturning Roe v Wade. 'It's not about a particular procedure,' says Emmert, 'it's about turning the public against abortion in general. And it's working: the frightening thing is, when we look at polling numbers, increasingly young women who have not lived through the days before Roe are more apt to say they are anti-choice.' Tobias says that overturning Roe v Wade 'will take a few years, but I certainly think it's possible'. </p> <p>Susan Cohen, director of Government Affairs at the Alan Guttmacher Institute in Washington, formerly part of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, believes that a Bush win means 'we can anticipate more federal legislation restricting various aspects of access to abortion'. </p> <p>One of these is the Child Custody Protection Act. If passed, it would mean that, if a minor who lived in a state requiring parental consent crossed state lines to have an abortion in one that didn't, whoever accompanied her - friend, boyfriend, grandmother - could be jailed. In some states abortion clinic staff face daily aggressive protests. Since 1977 there have been seven murders, 166 arson attacks and 1,042 acts of vandalism at clinics. </p> <p>Dorothy Fadiman is now a 65-year-old maker of documentaries. She is married, has children, and has been nominated for an Oscar for a film she made about abortion. In the run-up to this election, she has been touring colleges in swing states, trying to keep young women informed. 'It's the stealth nature of the effort. Under the radar screen, they've been whittling away at all these rights. Now the liberals are saying, \"Where were we? Asleep at the wheel?\".' </p> <p><b>Gaby Wood</b></p> <p><b>JOBS</b> <br><b>Mixed messages in the Rust Belt</b></p> <p>It is called the Rust Belt and it extends in a wide arc across the north-east of America, from Buffalo in upstate New York to the car capital of Detroit hundreds of miles away in Michigan. </p> <p>It is a land of emptying factories and job losses. It should be safe Democratic territory. But in America's divided election of 2004, few things are simple and the issue of jobs is no exception. </p> <p>The Rust Belt runs across several key battleground states, including Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan. All have suffered job losses. For some, voting for John Kerry is as natural as breathing. John Abdalla, chairman of the Democratic Party in Ohio's Jefferson County, says jobs are the key issue in his corner of the most vital swing state in the election. 'We just cannot stand any more of this,' he said. </p> <p>Jefferson County lies alongside the Ohio river valley and is full of towns that rely on the huge steel mills that dot its banks. But many are running on much reduced capacity. Some have closed. Joseph Brem used to work in one of them. But its workforce has been slashed, and his healthcare benefits have been lost. Now he is volunteering for Kerry's campaign. 'I will do whatever it takes to beat Bush,' Brem said. </p> <p>Brem said everyone in his hometown of Steubenville has a story about the decline of the mills. Their legacy is obvious. Huge murals celebrating the steel industry are painted on the sides of buildings on the town's main street. The hulking mill complex dominates the town, as do the scarred hills above it, decimated by decades of mining. </p> <p>Justice Smith pointed to the mill. 'This is a steel town. Both my grandfathers spent 40 years in that mill,' he said. 'Steel is everything here.' </p> <p>But there are other economic trends afoot. Smith lives in Steubenville, but works in nearby Pittsburgh as an advertising executive. New jobs have arrived in the Rust Belt. </p> <p>In fact, the traditional political orthodoxy - that job losses equals a boost for Democrats - has not held true in 2004. In Ohio, which has lost almost a quarter of a million jobs in the past four years, the race is still tight. The same is true in Michigan, where factory closures and layoffs have not yet put the state firmly in the Democratic camp. Bush is still campaigning hard and has the state firmly in his sights as winnable. </p> <p>Yet the situation is reversed in Florida. There the economy is booming and producing more jobs than anywhere else in the country. In the past 12 months, 125,000 new jobs were created. Bush won the state last time by a razor-thin, and fiercely disputed, margin of just over 500 votes. But this time round, Bush has failed to capitalise on the boom. The state could still vote for Kerry. </p> <p>There are two factors that confuse the picture. The first is that terrorism and the war in Iraq has trumped jobs as the main issue in the Rust Belt and elsewhere. </p> <p>David Griffey is a life-long Ohio steelworker, the son of a retired union president and a registered Democrat. Yet last week he attended a Bush rally in Youngstown, Ohio, and said he was voting for the President. 'Bush is trying to create peace around the world. The mistakes in Iraq are from the military. You can't blame the President for them,' he said. In Florida, that situation is reversed. The state is home to many veterans and families of soldiers. Many have turned against the war and will be supporting Kerry. </p> <p>The other factor is the economy itself. It has painted a confusing picture that has allowed both candidates to pick and choose what they want. Kerry has slammed the job losses and pointed to the fact that Bush is the first President since the 1930s to preside over a net loss of jobs. But the Republicans point to a low unemployment rate that matches the levels of the boom during the era of Bill Clinton. They also say that economic growth is healthy. </p> <p>That allows George Bush relentlessly to use the same stump speech phrase at rally after rally. 'The economy is strong and getting stronger,' he says. </p> <p><b>Paul Harris</b></p> <p><b>SECURITY</b> <br><b>Military's poll paradox</b></p> <p>Steven McHugh never planned a career in the military. But after al-Qaeda launched its attacks on 11 September, the 22-year-old from New Jersey told his mother that he believed it was the defining moment of his generation. So McHugh volunteered to fight those responsible. </p> <p>But where the army took McHugh was not to the war against Osama bin Laden, but Iraq. When he returned on leave to New Jersey in July his mother Mildred was shocked how her son had been changed in six months based near the city of Samarra. </p> <p>'He seemed like a different person. He had lost his best friend in his unit. He said that he had seen some terrible stuff. He was incredibly jumpy, looking at cars all the time as if they be a threat and dropping to his knees if he heard a loud noise.' </p> <p>What makes Mildred angry is that she believes her son's sense of idealism and duty was betrayed. Steven was sent to fight the wrong war. </p> <p>The result has been that for the first time in her life, the 44-year-old has started going to demonstrations. She says if the US electorate returns George Bush as President this week she is not certain how to deal with her disappointment with her fellow Americans. </p> <p>And for those like Mildred and her son, the appearance of the bin Laden tape has confronted them with the central paradox of this election: if security is the big issue, then how is it that after so many American deaths, the self-declared nemesis of the US is still free to taunt them? </p> <p>It is this question that has separated the two candidates' rhetoric most bitterly, as John Kerry has repeated again and again on the stump that he would have done it differently and concentrated his efforts on bin Laden. Bush, meanwhile, has accused Kerry of being inconsistent in his record of voting as a Senator on terror issues. </p> <p>Which leaves the question: would a Kerry presidency be any more effective in confronting the problems in Iraq or the elusive bin Laden? </p> <p>It is a moot point. In a speech in February in Los Angeles, Kerry articulated his vision for a new direction on the war on terror while admitting that the US was still committed to finishing the job in Iraq. </p> <p>On the fight against al-Qaeda, his proposals often appear as much a change of style and management skills as a grand departure into new territory, diplomacy and international consensus. </p> <p>Where Kerry does differ, though, is in dealing with issues around the problem - insisting on the need for a tougher line on money flowing through Saudi Arabia and a campaign of 'naming and shaming' those involved in financing terrorism. </p> <p>'The fight requires us to use every tool at our disposal,' Kerry said then. 'Not only a strong military - but renewed alliances, vigorous law enforcement, reliable intelligence and unremitting efforts to shut down the flow of terrorist funds. </p> <p>'To do this demands that we work with other countries instead of walking alone. For today the agents of terrorism work and lurk in the shadows of 60 nations on every continent. In this entangled world, we need to build real and enduring alliances. </p> <p>'Allies give us more hands in the struggle, but no President would ever let them tie our hands and prevent us from doing what must be done.' </p> <p>Among those unimpressed by either of the candidates' approach to the threat of al-Qaeda or Iraq is Zbigniew Brzezinski, national security adviser in the Carter administration. </p> <p>Writing in the New York Times last week, he noted acerbically: 'Both candidates have become prisoners of a worldview that fundamentally misdiagnoses the central challenge of our time. President Bush's \"global war on terror\" is a politically expedient slogan without real substance... The predicament faced by America in Iraq is more complex than the solutions offered so far by the Democratic side in the presidential contest.' </p> <p>If one thing is certain, it is that whoever wins the election, soldiers such as Steven McHugh will still be fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. </p> <p><b>Peter Beaumont</b></p> <p><b>SUPREME COURT</b><br><b>Tipping the balance</b></p> <p>With moral and cultural issues playing as large a role in influencing Tuesday's presidential election as security, money and war, the question over the future make-up of the US Supreme Court is the issue that neither candidate has wished to fully acknowledge. </p> <p>Beyond the prospect that disputed results in many states could once again put the outcome of the election in the hands of nine ageing justices, the next president is almost certain to have the power to affect the ideological balance of the court, which often divides five to four on controversial issues. </p> <p>With America's moral and cultural armies squaring off over gay marriage, stem-cell research and abortion, the power to appoint one or more new justices to the ideologically divided court is perhaps more important in the long term than who sits in the White House. </p> <p>Last week, the issue came into focus when it was announced the court's 80-year-old chief justice, William Rehnquist, was being treated for thyroid cancer. Rehnquist, an ideological conservative who has presided over the court for 17 years and who has seen the country move to the right since he was appointed by Nixon, is said to be ready for work next week in case there are election issues to resolve. </p> <p>But Rehnquist's illness placed both sides of America's cultural divide on notice. Three other justices have already been treated for cancer, and with all but one over the age of 65, the court is fast approaching a changing of the guard that makes the outcome of Tuesday's vote all the more important. </p> <p>It's 10 years since the last justice was confirmed; not since 1812-23 has it gone that long unchanged. Indeed, some commentators fear Kerry's first or Bush's second term could be dominated by nomination battles. </p> <p>Democrats see the court as dominated five to four by conservatives; Republicans see it as evenly split. Any change in the make-up could tip it further either way. </p> <p>'This election is not just about the next four years but the next 40,' says Nan Aron, president of Alliance for Justice. 'The new president or the re-elected president will have huge control over the future direction of the court.' </p> <p>Democrats fear that if Bush is reelected, he will follow a familiar pattern of judicial appointment. 'Ideology has triumphed qualification in Bush's judicial selections,' says Aron. 'He's looked for young ideologues with fixed hostilities toward civil rights, environmental and consumer protections and a woman's right to choose.' </p> <p>Despite his faith, Kerry has vowed he will not nominate a judge who does not support abortion rights. Bush, somewhat opaquely, says he'll name 'judges who know the difference between personal opinion and the strict interpretation of the law'. </p> <p>Under a Bush second term Democrats fear a conservative could be selected to replace liberal John Paul Stevens, 84. And conservative groups fear a liberal successor to Rehnquist or to the committed conservative Antonin Scalia. </p> <p>'I don't think it is too much to say that the culture may well hang in the balance with the appointment of Supreme Court justices in the coming years,' says Tony Perkins, president of the socially conservative Family Research Council. </p> <p>As an original opponent of abortion rights and supporter of invading neutral Cambodia in the early 1970s, Rehnquist has been a soldier for the right, helping to deliver the 2000 election to Bush, weakening the barrier between church and state, restricting the criminal appeals process and the reach of affirmative action, as well as reducing the power of Washington to dictate to the states. </p> <p>During this election the court has already made itself felt. Two weeks ago, it refused to hear an appeal by independent candidate Ralph Nader, against a lower-court ruling that kept him off the Pennsylvania ballot. And last week, Clinton appointee Justice Stephen Breyer admitted he wasn't sure he was being truly impartial when he voted against a recount in Florida in 2000 and thus gave Bush the White House. </p> <p>Still, there is little doubt that when Americans go to the polls next week, they will be voting on issues that will ultimately end up before the Supreme Court. Eleven state ballots, including four crucial swing states, carry an amendment defining marriage as the union of one man and one woman. </p> <p>It's the issue beyond others that has energised Christian evangelicals and other social conservatives. In Ohio, where polls are dead even, the Ohio Campaign to Protect Marriage claims to have registered 55,000 new voters on the strength of feeling over the issue. Both sides of the marriage debate say it could be the issue that swings the state, and potentially the election. </p> <p>And even if the election results do not end up before the court, it is likely that key national issues will be before it again in the near future. 'All you need is the retirement of one or two justices and rulings on abortion, affirmative action, gay rights and the death penalty can be in play again,' says John Yoo, a law professor at the University of California at Berkeley. </p> <p>At the same time, scaremongering by both sides is rampant as both candidates try to motivate their bases. 'It's too big a leap to think all the big decisions of the last 30 years could be reversed,' says Stephen Hess of the Brookings Institution. 'Everything is carried to extreme in these last couple of days.'</p> <p><b>Ed Helmore</b></p> <p><b>They said what?</b></p> <p>'Too many good docs are getting out of the business.

  "<b>If Bush wins...</b> <p>Bush is unlikely to move too quickly if elected for a second term. </p> <p>The initial focus of a second administration will continue to be Iraq. </p> <p>The long-delayed assault by American and Iraqi troops to take Fallujah is widely expected and possibly attacks on other towns, such as Ramadi.</p> <p>Bush has several domestic policy goals that he will move to fulfil. These will include moves to make his first-term tax cuts permanent.</p> <p>Some critics believe that further reform of America's tax code might include taking a look at replacing income tax with a sales tax.</p> <p>The President also wants to press ahead with the semi-privatisation of social security. However, both these plans could be too radical for any second term. Historically, two-term Presidents have been more moderate in their second period in the White House.</p> <p>Also likely to push for another energy bill, which may enrage the environmental lobby again trying to drill for oil in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Reserve, after his first attempt failed to make it into law.</p> <p>Has promised to try again to cap damages in medical malpractice suits.</p> <p>Likely to have to make several Supreme Court appointments and may please his conservative base by naming anti-abortion justices, thus paving the way for a second-term challenge to America's abortion laws.</p> <p> <b>If Kerry wins...</b></p> <p>He has sworn to make winning wider international support for the US in Iraq one of his key initial objectives. By the time Kerry takes power, the Iraqi elections will be taking place or have been suspended due to security problems.</p> <p>He has also pledged to bring his health care plan to Congress within 100 days. He has said this will be his first major attempt at new legislation.</p> <p>On taxes, Kerry will revoke the Bush tax cuts for Americans earning more than $200,000 a year. He will keep cuts affecting people earning less than that.</p> <p>He may also engage America in talks to renegotiate some of the terms of the Kyoto environmental pact and wants to set a goal for the US of eventually becoming energy independent.</p> <p>Major legislation is likely to be hampered by the expectation that Republicans will continue to control Congress. In Iraq, events on the ground will likely continue to dictate US military actions, regardless of policy in Washington.</p> <p>He will bring in fresh faces. His priority is to replace attorney-general John Ashcroft with a more moderate figure. He will also try to heal deep divisions, such as the split between the Pentagon and State Department.</p> <p>Kerry is also committed to engaging with the UN. The expected retirement of several Supreme Court judges, means he will almost certainly have to make appointments to America's ultimate legal body. He has said he will not appoint a justice who favours banning abortion.</p> <p> <b>If it is deadlock...</b></p> <p>If the election is close and boils down to a wafer-thin margin in just a handful of states, it could be lawyers who dominate the next 100 days.</p> <p>Mobile 'Swat' teams of legal eagles are ready with private jets to swoop down on any trouble spots.</p> <p>Argument over provisional ballots are likely to dominate any legal challenges.

  "Sitting on Washington's Pennsylvania Avenue, the Capital Grille is where the congressmen and lawyers of the Republican Party, its business supporters, its petitioners and lobbyists, dine on 24oz porterhouse steaks, smoke Davidoff cigars and drink bottles of Haut Brion. <p>Its allure is not necessarily the food. The steaks at Morton's - more favoured by a Democratic crowd - are generally accepted to be finer. Instead, it is about atmosphere and connections, the knowledge of close proximity to the wheels of power. It is an ambience once memorably summed up by Roll Call, the Congressional weekly, as 'to hell with the have-nots'. </p> <p>The Capital Grille, with its vast slabs of marbled meat and brittle, well-groomed young women flirting with rich attorneys, says former Democratic congressman turned lobbyist Toby Moffett, is a 'real Republican place'. </p> <p>'The Capital Grille will take a financial hit if Kerry is elected,' said Moffett. 'There will just be fewer Republicans and a lot less money chasing after them.' </p> <p>In a capital and country more partisan than at any time in living memory, what happens in the polls on Tuesday will have far-reaching consequences for the competing political cultures of DC. </p> <p>And if it is not a changing of the guard that is around the corner with a Kerry victory, then it is the consolidation of a Bush Washington whose atmosphere is invidious to liberal causes. In either event, there will be change and pain. </p> <p>'If there is a change of president,' says Moffett, 'there will be some furious scrambling. It will affect thousands of people. There will be a huge turnover inside the lobbying firms, in the big associations who will want to have the right people representing them in Washington, in the corporate offices, most of which are run by Republicans.' </p> <p>A Democratic lobbyist, the head of Livingston-Moffett has found the Washington of the past four years a tough place to work. </p> <p>'I think most Democrats have suffered after Bush took power. The way these guys play the game has hurt incomes. The only thing that has saved Democratic lobbyists is the fact that, in the Senate you need 60 votes, not a straight majority.' </p> <p>A Kerry win, said Moffett, would end four years of exile for many of the liberal groups that campaign on issues from human rights to gun control who have been 'in exile' since the advent of the Bush administration. </p> <p>It is in the area of funding and 'de-funding' of pressure groups - and in their access to power - that the results of the election will be most keenly felt. </p> <p>It is a process that has been documented by New York political commentator Esther Kaplan. In her book, With God on Their Side, she details the ruthless culling of 'mainstream scientific, professional and policy organisations, whose constituencies tend to lean Democratic, [and] have been removed from influential federal advisory positions and replaced by ideologues'. </p> <p>Writes Kaplan: 'The American Medical Association no longer advises US delegates to UN summits on children's issues; Concerned Women for America does instead. Experts from the Centre for Aids Prevention Studies no longer sit on the presidential Aids advisory council; they have been replaced by a former beauty queen who lectures on abstinence.' </p> <p>It is a process, says Kaplan, that has been pursued through obscenity prosecutions, audits and Byzantine new financial reporting rules. What is without doubt is that a Kerry victory would see the renaissance of groups that have been excluded for four years. </p> <p>Four more years of Bush - it seems fair to say - would see a continuation of the relentless attrition on liberal groups and causes. </p> <p>It is not simply in the access to the levers of power that Washington faces the possibility of change, but in the psycho-geography of the capital itself and its centre of political and social gravity. It is about how Washington defines itself as a location. </p> <p>It is overwhelmingly Democratic - more than 70 per cent of DC voters are expected to vote Kerry: 'Republican Washington' is best summed up by the, wealthy Wasp suburbs of north Virginia, in particular McClean, which has come to be identified with the Bush administration. </p> <p>'In terms of political culture,' says Peter Beinart, editor of New Republic magazine, 'Washington always feels a more happening place when the Democrats are in power because they live in Washington.' </p> <p>A Kerry victory, Beinart predicts, would also be accompanied by talk of a 'Boston renaissance' following the Boston Red Sox winning the baseball World Series and the recent successes in American football of the New England Patriots. </p> <p>But the most significant change if Kerry wins is that his presidency would mark the 'end of a period of alienation from empiricism', returning Washington from faith-based policy-making. </p> <p>This theme is taken up by John Pike, head of GlobalSecurity think tank. 'What has happened is that the political culture in this town has got to the stage it can no longer differentiate between what is and what should be. In the past four years, the political conversation has deteriorated into a series of 'talking points' - party lines - where most people have no idea what they are saying.' </p> <p>It is hardly surprising. The relationship between the administration and academia is summed up by the attitude of Bush strategist, Karl Rove, when he defined the 'Democratic base' to the New Yorker as 'anyone with a doctorate'. </p> <p>But one thing is certain, and that is, whoever wins, the levers of power will at least be pulled by some different faces, even if a wholesale change doesn't happen. A Bush second term, say Washington insiders would almost certainly see Secretary of State Colin Powell leave the administration, tired after so many humiliations at the hands of the neo-conservatives. </p> <p>Condoleezza Rice, too, is believed to be keen to move on or up, and is said to have told friends that she will stay if asked to by Bush, but would really like to be Secretary for Defence. </p> <p>Before then, however, as the patrons of the Capital Grille are only too aware, there is an election to be won.</p>",
  "You may not like what he is saying. You may abhor everything he stands for. But you are listening, aren't you? You have heard what he has to say. You have listened to his arguments. You are, you have to admit, somewhat rattled by the fact that he is able to say it at all. <p>The truth is that Osama bin Laden is very good at what he does. He is one of the great propagandists - up there with Himmler, Lenin, Napoleon and Louis XIV. He has an awesome understanding of the holy triumvirate of political communication: the power of the image, the message and the deed. And he understands how they work together.</p> <p>The al-Qaeda leader's video address, broadcast late on Friday night, is not directed at influencing the American elections, as most analysts have supposed. If that had been his primary purpose, he would have been more explicit. Bin Laden and his aides have a relatively sophisticated understanding of US politics - as was shown on the tape by their reference to the workings of the American electoral college system - and he could have easily made statements that would have boosted Bush or Kerry in the polls. Calling on the American people to vote for one or the other would have been enough. As it was, bin Laden's statements were equivocal.</p> <p>Instead, bin Laden's primary aim, as well as to point out in spectacular fashion that he is alive and well, is to get as many people as possible to listen to him. He and his aides have always recognised that few share their views, in the Islamic world or outside it, and have sought to overcome the practical difficulties imposed by their physical location (currently up a mountain on the Afghan-Pakistani border) and be heard. Bin Laden's timing is meticulous. He knows that breaking his silence now - he has issued no similar statement on video since the 11 September attacks - will receive massive attention.</p> <p>His message is directed at two audiences: the West, particularly America, and the world's 1.3 billion Muslims. He is explaining why the World Trade Centre was attacked and saying that, because all the reasons remain, further violence is inevitable. 'You attack our security, we will attack yours,' he says.</p> <p>Bin Laden believes he is engaged in a last-ditch struggle to protect his religion, culture and society from a belligerent West that has never abandoned the project, started with the Crusades, of humiliating, subordinating and dividing Islam. He is explaining this to the people of America. Wake up, he says, and see where your leaders are taking you.</p> <p>But he is also talking to the vast majority of those in the Islamic world who have rejected his extremist message and violent path. Wake up, he is saying, and join us. Wake up and fight.</p> <p>To galvanise them, he uses a wide range of tools. He says the inspiration for the World Trade Centre attack was seeing Israeli jets bomb tower blocks in Lebanon in 1982. This is patent rubbish. We know the plan for 11 September was first presented to him - and rejected - by a senior militant called Khaled Sheikh Mohammed in 1996. It was adopted only in 1999 after a controversial decision to attack American soil.</p> <p>However, the reference to the Israelis, and to 1982 in Lebanon, when the Palestinians were massacred in the Sabra and Shatila camps and Hizbollah launched its campaign to bomb the forces of the Jewish state out of the country, resonates powerfully in the Middle East. It is also another attempt explicitly to bind bin Laden to the Palestinian cause - a link he has tried to establish, and Palestinians have tried to resist, for many years.</p> <p>Bin Laden, after three years of near absence from our screens, is also reminding us that he is the top of the terrorist tree. In recent months, the younger militant, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, has received the most publicity. Now bin Laden is backat the top of the world's news bulletins. His expensive robes, white turban, measured delivery, lectern and plain backdrop, as well as the absence of the customary combat jacket, cave and AK47 rifle, are an attempt to establish him, in stark contrast to the thuggish Zarqawi, as more than just a man of violence, but as a statesman, scholar, prince and, though he would never admit it, a kind of prophet too.</p> <p>There are two consolations for bin Laden's enemies. The 47-year-old Saudi-born dissident does not appear to use his left arm, possibly confirming he was injured in Afghanistan three years ago. And there can be little doubt that if he had been able to orchestrate a major terrorist attack in the US, he would have done so.</p> <p>But, whether it be propaganda by deed or straight propaganda, we have to admit that he is good at it. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Jason Burke is author of 'Al-Qaeda: the True Story of Radical Islam'</p>",
  "George W Bush moved yesterday to seize the political advantage after Osama bin Laden's extraordinary intervention in the US presidential election on Friday night. <p>The campaign descended into a final bout of acrimony yesterday as both sides attacked each other for making political capital out of the al-Qaeda leader's video address. But it appeared to be the incumbent who will gain any political advantage. </p> <p>A Newsweek tracker poll published yesterday suggested the momentum may be moving in the incumbent's way. The poll predicted Bush to win by 50 per cent to Kerry's 44, compared with a 48-46 gap last week. </p> <p>As the candidates spent their last Saturday before Tuesday's election attacking one another over terrorism, political analysts were quick to suggest that bin Laden's intervention would favour Bush, who has consistently led John Kerry on security. </p> <p>Kerry was the first to use the tape to attack his opponent, appealing for Americans to show unity, but then quickly condemning Bush for missing an opportunity to capture bin Laden. 'I regret that when George Bush had the opportunity in Afghanistan and Tora Bora, he didn't choose to use American forces to hunt down and kill Osama bin Laden,' Kerry said. </p> <p>Bush responded by lambasting Kerry's comments as 'shameful', and his aides followed up the attack. 'You would think there would be maybe 12 hours to let the American people absorb this [the video],' said White House spokesman Dan Bartlett. </p> <p>Democrats at first said Kerry had not seen the tape when he made his comments. However, his aides held conference calls with reporters and in their turn attacked the Republicans for using the video as a political tool. </p> <p>'It's offensive and shameful for this president to play politics the way he did today with this issue,' Joe Lockhart a senior Kerry strategist told the Los Angeles Times. </p> <p>The developing political row over the bin Laden tape came amid news from Iraq that eight Marines has been killed and nine others injured after heavy clashes, apparently just outside Fallujah. </p> <p>The combination of the bin Laden tape and the new Iraq violence has thrust the issue of security back to the front of a campaign that has been dominated by terrorism. </p> <p>Kerry's initial mis-step seems to have allowed the Republicans to put his team on the defensive over a video whose content - most analysts believe - favours Bush's campaign, not least because it also succeeded in knocking two major news stories potentially damaging to the president off the front pages. </p> <p>Allegations over missing explosives in Iraq and an FBI probe of Halliburton hit the Bush campaign all last week. </p> <p>The campaign had also been hurt by the revelation that one of its most important final campaign ads - showing soldiers supporting Bush - had been doctored. But those stories have now been replaced by the ghostly image of bin Laden telling Americans they have brought their troubles on themselves. </p> <p>As US intelligence analysts studied the full ,unbroadcast version of the tape, it emerged that the US ambassador to Qatar had attempted to persuade the Qatari government to pressure al Jazeera into suppressing it. The tape was delivered in a package to the network's Islamabad office on Friday morning. </p> <p>Senior executives in Qatar quickly took the decision to broadcast the tape. 'We don't believe anyone can argue about the newsworthiness of this latest Osama bin Laden recording. Any news organisation would have aired the tape if they had received it,' Jihad Ballout, an al-Jazeera spokesman, said. </p> <p>Analysis of the tape indicates that it was made last weekend. Officials in Washington say there is a text at the start saying that it was produced by 'al-Shahab media company', an al-Qaeda trademark. The tape is also dated to the 10th day of Ramadan, the Muslim holy month - last Sunday. </p> <p>Intelligence officials in the US and Europe were combing the text for any hints of future attacks. Investigators probing recent blasts in Egypt believe that a codeword ordering the attacks was hidden in an audio tape released by Ayman al-Zawahiri, bin Laden's deputy, shortly before the strike. </p> <p>It is highly doubtful that any American would change their vote on the basis of a statement by a man who has taken responsibility for the 11 September attacks that cost almost 3,000 lives. </p> <p>But the real influence of the statement lies in the emphasis it places on terrorism for the few final days of the election. Polls have consistently shown that Bush leads Kerry on terrorism. Bush has consistently referred to himself as a wartime president. </p> <p>Analysts were divided over the impact. Peverill Squire, a political scientist at the University of Iowa, told the Los Angeles Times: 'We have become so divided in terms of partisanship that each side will read what they want into the statement. What Republicans are thinking is: \"This puts the focus back on terrorism.\" And the people supporting Kerry say this shows bin Laden is alive and well three years after we said we were going to get him.' </p> <p>With just two days to go until election day, many polls still have the candidates neck and neck. A Zogby tracking poll released yesterday had Kerry one point ahead of Bush by 47 per cent to 46. However, most polls last week gave Bush a two- or three-point lead. An average of all polls has Bush leading Kerry by 2.5 per cent. </p> <p>In London, the tape dramatically heightens fear- - already pre-occupying the Home Secretary, David Blunkett - that al-Qaeda will seek to disrupt Britain's general election next year, either through propaganda stunts like the tape or direct attacks. </p> <p>Michael Ancram, the shadow foreign secretary, hinted at such fears yesterday, warning that terrorist 'blackmail' should not prevail in elections anywhere: 'Bin Laden is clearly trying to follow a strategy whereby he can appear to have influence over the outcome of elections in democratic countries, thereby showing that fundamentalist terrorism pays. I hope US voters - indeed voters everywhere - will treat this blackmail with the contempt it deserves.' </p> <p>Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy condemned bin Laden's 'cynical' manipulation, but said his intervention highlighted the fatal error of failing to finish the war on Afghanistan before launching military action in Iraq. </p> <p>The repercussions will be felt at Westminster next Thursday, when MPs are due to debate terrorism. By then, the possibility of change in the White House will have galvanised internal debate over where the war on terror should go next. </p> <p>Although ministers have been warned not to comment on the US elections, most Labour MPs are privately 'praying morning, noon and night' for a Kerry victory, as a senior minister put it. However, another minister warned yesterday of an 'emotional spasm' of anti-Bush feeling clouding the left's judgment, arguing that a second Bush term could produce benefits for Britain. </p> <p>Yesterday Ladbrokes shortened the odds on a Bush win from 4/6 to 8/13, as the bin Laden video prompted a rush of money on the Republicans.</p>",
  "The election season is always hellish for people who fancy that they live by political principles, because 'politics' becomes, even more than usually, a matter of showbusiness and superficial calculation. Ever since 1980, when I bet the liberals of New York that Ronald Reagan would win easily (and didn't have to buy my own lunch for months afterward), I have sympathised with the prisoners' dilemma facing liberals and leftists every four years. The shady term 'lesser evil' was evolved to deal with this very trap. <p>Should you endorse a Democrat in whom you don't really believe? Is it time for that deep-breath, third-party vote, or angry abstention of the sort that has tortured some Americans since they just couldn't take Hubert Humphrey over Richard Nixon? </p> <p>Absent from this triangular calculation is the irony of history. Does anyone really, deeply wish that Jimmy Carter had been re-elected, or that Michael Dukakis had won? Implicit in the desire of the prisoner to escape is the banal, unexciting assumption of America's two-party oligopoly: sometimes it's not so bad that 'the other' party actually wins. Thus I ought to begin by stating my reasons to hope for victory by John Kerry and John Edwards. </p> <p>Given my underlying stipulation - that this is a single-issue election and that that is a good and necessary thing - I have no formal quarrel with the Kerry/Edwards platform. It ostensibly calls for military victory over the alliance between autocracy and jihad. It does not shade the moral distinction that has to be made between 'our' imperfect civilisation and those who want to turn Islamic society into a medieval, lethal dust bowl. </p> <p>The Kerry camp rightly excoriates the President and his cabinet for their near-impeachable irresponsibility in the matter of postwar planning in Iraq. </p> <p>I can't wait to see President Kerry discover which corporation, aside from Halliburton, should after all have got the contract to reconstruct Iraq's oil industry. I look forward to seeing him eat his Jesse Helms-like words about the false antithesis between spending money abroad and 'at home' (as if this war, sponsored from abroad, hadn't broken out 'at home'). I take pleasure in advance in the discovery that he will have to make, that Abu Musab al-Zarqawi is a more dangerous and a better-organised foe than Osama bin Laden, and that Zarqawi's existence is a product of jihadism plus Saddamism, and not of any error on America's part. </p> <p>I notice that, given the ambivalent evidence about Saddam's weaponry, Kerry had the fortitude to make the presumption of guilt rather than innocence. I assume he has already discerned the difference between criticising the absence of postwar planning and criticising the presence of an anti-Saddam plan to begin with. In other words, I look forward to the assumption of his responsibility. </p> <p>Should the electors decide for Bush, as I would slightly prefer, his excruciating personality strikes me as a second, or third, order consideration. If the worst to be said of him is true - that he is an idiotic Sabbath fanatic with nothing between his large Texan ears - that, presumably, was just as true when he ran against Al Gore and against nation-building and foreign intervention. </p> <p>It is Bush's conversion from isolationism that impresses me, just as it is the lapse into isolationism on Kerry's part that makes me sceptical. </p> <p>Don't like 'the smirking' of Bush? What about the endless smirks about the administration's difficulties, whether genuine or self-imposed? The all-knowing smirks about 'the secular' Saddam, or the innocuousness of prewar Iraq? </p> <p>The sneers about the astonishing success of our forces in Afghanistan, who are now hypocritically praised by many who opposed their initial deployment? This is to say nothing of the innuendos that are now part of pseudo-radical rumour-mongering and defamation. </p> <p>Whoever wins, I shall live to see these smirks banished, at least. </p> <p>I can visualise a Kerry victory and can claim to have written one of the earliest essays calling attention to the merits of John Edwards. What slightly disturbs me is the liberal refusal to admit the consequences of 'Anybody But Bush', now the only glue binding the radical left to the Democratic Party right. </p> <p>The amazing thing is the literalness with which the mantra is chanted. Anybody? Including Muqtada al-Sadr? The chilling answer is, quite often, yes. This is nihilism. Actually, it's nihilism at best. If it isn't treason to the country - let us not go there - it is certainly treason to the principles of the left. </p> <p>I was asked if I would also say something here about my personal evolution. I took that to mean: How do you like your new right-wing friends? I can only return the question. I prefer them to Pat Buchanan and Vladimir Putin and the stupid British Conservative Party, to the mendacious populism of Michael Moore, who compares the psychopathic murderers of Iraqis to the Minutemen. I am glad to have seen the day when a Tory leader is repudiated by the White House. An irony of history is when Republicans are willing to risk a dangerous confrontation with an untenable status quo. I am proud of what little I have done to forward this revolutionary cause. </p> <p>In Kabul recently I interviewed Masuda Jalal, a brave Afghan physician who was now able to run for the presidency. I asked her about her support for the intervention in Iraq. 'For us,' she said, 'the battle against terrorism and against dictatorship are the same thing.' I dare you to smirk at such simple-mindedness as that. </p> <p>I could take refuge in saying that I was a Blair supporter rather than a Bush endorser, and I am a member of a small international regime-change left[-wing] that originates in solidarity with our embattled brothers and sisters in Afghanistan and Iraq, who have received zero support from the American 'anti-war' movement. I won't even consider any reconsideration, at least until Islamist websites start posting items that ask themselves, and not us: can we go on taking such casualties? Have our tactics been too hideous and stupid? Only then can anything like a negotiation begin. </p> <p>The President, notwithstanding his shortcomings of intellect, has been able to say repeatedly the essential thing: that we are involved in this war without apology and without remorse. </p> <p>He should go further and admit the possibility of defeat, which might concentrate a few minds, while abjuring any notion of capitulation. Kerry is also capable of saying this, but not without cheapening it or qualifying it, so that he is offering you the worst of both worlds. </p> <p>I have made my own escape from self-imposed quandary. Once you have done it, there's no going back. I have met a few other former hostages, and they all agree that the relief is unbelievable.</p>",
  "The tour around the battlefield of Gettysburg finishes at a copse known as the 'High Water Mark of the Confederacy'. Among these rolling Pennsylvanian hills the Union forces of the north staved off a final, heroic charge by 12,000 Southern troops in 1863. From that moment, the Confederate cause was doomed. <p>On Tuesday, the quintessential Yankee, John Kerry, hopes to deliver a similar knockout blow to the ambitions of born-again southerner George Bush. Pennsylvania is again a battleground. Across its cities and farmland an ideological struggle between north and south is being played out. </p> <p>Neighbourhood by neighbourhood, the divisions are apparent in 'Kerry-Edwards' and 'Bush-Cheney' placards jostling for space on lawns. Since 2001 the President has visited this state more than three dozen times; Kerry over 20 times since March alone. Last week he brought Bill Clinton. </p> <p>The ferocity of this election has reignited America's simmering cultural divide. Pundits now split the country not between confederates and unionists, but between red (Republican) and blue (Democrat) states. Red-state inhabitants believe in God, guns and marriage, blue-state citizens in science, secular politics and social liberalism. It is no surprise that, outside of Iraq, the hot-button issues of this election focus on such controversies as stem-cell research, abortion, and gay marriage rather than deficits and healthcare. </p> <p>Much of this can be traced to Bush. Elected as 'a uniter, not a divider', committed to compassionate conservatism, he pushed a ruthlessly partisan agenda. He has packed his cabinet with zealots and spurned bipartisan initiatives, including the recommendations of the independent 9/11 Commission. The result is a nation at loggerheads. </p> <p>Pennsylvania provides a microcosm of this ugly divide. It combines liberal Philadelphia with de-industrialising Pittsburgh and a conservative rural heartland. Al Gore won the state by a whisker in 2000, but many conservative Democrats are drawn to Bush's faith-and-family rhetoric. Success will lie in Philadelphia's sprawling suburbs, where Kerry has an edge. Bush, on the other hand, is courting the large Amish community. </p> <p>At the national level, polls put neither candidate outside the margin of error. One of the favourite scenarios among Democrats is for Kerry to take the electoral college, while Bush wins the popular vote. The probability of a dead heat in the college of 269-269 is minimal, but what is more likely is the election count descending into legal chaos. Some 20,000 lawyers stand ready as Democrats try to right Gore's wrong with a barrage of lawsuits. Yet the Bush machine, headed by faithful consigliere James Baker, has never been one to give up power lightly. </p> <p>The real, lasting damage of such internecine strife is a collapse of faith in the institutional fabric. This election is likely to produce a record turn-out, but if people feel their vote doesn't count they quickly lose trust in the system of governance. If there are repeated allegations of fraud or the electoral process reverts to the appointed judges of the US Supreme Court, then the 230-year-old constitutional machinery will face allegations of illegitimacy. </p> <p>The very process of effective administration could be in jeopardy. The party hostilities generated by this election mean that the man who wins will find it almost impossible to deliver a mandate, particularly in the case of Kerry who would probably face a Republican Congress and a revengeful right. Alternatively, Capitol Hill Democrats would not make the same mistake of co-operating with Bush as they did in the early days of his presidency. </p> <p>It was precisely to banish such political division that Abraham Lincoln travelled to Gettysburg four months after the July 1863 battle. In the cemetery where tens of thousands of soldiers lay, he delivered his famed address championing 'government of the people, by the people, for the people'. But what Lincoln stressed was neither north nor south, confederacy nor union, but the wholeness of the nation. That national unity of purpose, which delivered so much of America's greatness during the twentieth century, will this week be tested as rarely before. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Tristram Hunt is a visiting professor at Arizona State University</p>",
  "<p>The Queen has made a rare intervention in world politics to warn Tony Blair of her grave concerns over the White House's stance on global warming. </p> <p>She is understood to have asked Downing Street to lobby the US after observing the alarming impact of Britain's changing weather on her estates at Balmoral in Scotland and Sandringham in Norfolk. The revelation gives an unusual glimpse into the mind of the monarch, who normally strives to stay above politics. </p> <p>Further evidence of the Queen's views on global warming will be seen this week when she opens one of the most high-profile conferences ever staged in Europe on the issue. She is keen for this to be interpreted as a symbolic and political statement. </p> <p>The Berlin summit will come a day after the US presidential elections and its outcome will dictate the tone of key climate talks. George Bush's administration has remained hostile to international attempts to reduce emissions of climate change gases. </p> <p>'There has been dialogue between Downing Street and Buckingham Palace on all issues relating to climate change including the US position and the latest science. She is very keen to get involved,' said one of the UK's most eminent experts on climate change, who agreed to speak to The Observer on condition of anonymity. </p> <p>He added: 'From her own observations on the climate she has become worried like the rest of us. She has made it clear she wants to raise the importance of the issue.' </p> <p>In addition to her own fieldwork, the Queen was inspired by briefing papers supplied by Blair's chief scientist, Sir David King - who has described the threat of climate change as greater than global terrorism - and John Schellnhuber, research director of the Tyndall Centre, where Britain's pioneering work on global warming is conducted. </p> <p>During this week's conference, Tony Blair, using a live video link, will hail a new Anglo-German alliance to persuade other countries, including the US, to reduce the impact of global warming. </p> <p>Schellnhuber, who this week will receive a CBE from the Queen for his work on climate change, added that the identity of the next President of the US, the planet's biggest polluter, would dominate discussions. </p> <p>'If John Kerry wins, there might be a better chance of an open dialogue, there might be a feeling we can start again. If Bush wins, then we will have to wait and see,' added the former chief scientist to the German government. </p> <p>Environmentalists believe that the Queen's intervention is likely to prove crucial, particularly as Blair has promised to make climate change a key issue at the G8 group of major industrial nations next year. </p> <p>Among those present for the Queen this week will be Sir David King, Environment Secretary Margaret Beckett and Foreign Secretary Jack Straw, who sounded a fresh warning only last week about the perils of climate change. </p> <p>Bush has provoked international condemnation by refusing to ratify the Kyoto protocol, the international treaty to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Russia's recent decision to sign the treaty has isolated the US on an issue described by Blair as the greatest environmental threat to the planet. </p> <p>Both Downing Street and Buckingham Palace refused to comment last night, in keeping with the convention that Prime Ministers do not disclose the content of conversations with the Queen. </p> <p>She is known to take an active interest in her weekly audiences with her Prime Ministers, for which she is carefully briefed: after decades on the throne, her political insights are said to rival those of senior diplomats. The conversations take place without private secretaries present and are traditionally never disclosed by either side - although the Queen did once admit that her most enjoyable audiences had been with Winston Churchill. </p> <p>On the rare occasions that the Queen does express a forceful personal opinion on political issues, protocol dictates the Prime Minister should raise it on her behalf with the appropriate head of state or minister - but discreetly, without compromising her. It is extremely rare for her views to become public. </p> <p>By contrast, Prince Charles has lobbied increasingly openly on political issues, often firing off handwritten letters - nicknamed 'black spider memos' in Whitehall because of his writing - direct to ministers on subjects ranging from complementary medicine to hunting.</p>",
  "<p>It's musical chairs in British theatre again. Bristol Old Vic's David Farr has been appointed artistic director of London's Lyric Hammersmith. Actor-director Sam West comes in at Sheffield's Crucible. And Kerry Michael replaces Philip Hedley at Theatre Royal Stratford East. The Young Turks are taking over. But where are the women? </p> <p>Sometimes it seems the major buildings-based companies (the National, RSC, Almeida et al) remain in the clutch of a group of middle-aged, Oxbridge-educated men. Very able, charming men. But women are currently more under-represented as artistic directors in British theatres than at any point in the past 20 years. </p> <p>Which is odd when women are outperforming men in many arts institutions. A 2003 government survey found 60 per cent of people appointed to posts at chief executive level in the arts over the previous three years were women - from Amanda Nevill, director of the BFI, to Monica Mason, director of the Royal Ballet. So why does theatre lag behind? </p> <p>We've come a long way from the days when people looked blank if you asked them to name 10 famous women theatre directors. This year Katie Mitchell received ecstatic reviews for Iphigenia at the National. Lucy Bailey's The Postman Always Rings Twice (West Yorkshire Playhouse) is likely to transfer to the West End, while The Night Season , which she directed for the National, is a triumph. At Bristol Old Vic three out of four main house shows are directed by women (Nancy Meckler's Passage to India , Rachel Kavanaugh's Arcadia and Melly Still's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland ). Phyllida Lloyd's Mamma Mia! celebrated its fifth anniversary in the West End. And the prestigious 2004 Jerwood Award went to three women, Yael Shavit, Tiffany Watt-Smith and Roisin McBrinn. </p> <p>In the commercial arena, Thelma Holt, Nica Burns and Sonia Friedman have real power as producers. So why aren't more women being appointed to run the publicly subsidised buildings? 'I think it's hard to shake off the habits of the past 200 years,' Rachel Kavanaugh observes. 'Director is a word that sounds male in our society still. It's so interesting that even at the Globe you're called Master of Play, whether you're male or female.' </p> <p>Researching this feature, I spoke to 15 top British female directors. None could be accused of sour grapes but they all acknowledge that - in the nicest possible way - the theatre is a boys' club. As Erica Whyman, former director of the Gate, observes: 'Often you see interviews with male directors in their twenties which ask, \"Is this the future of British theatre?\". Women directors don't attract the same media attention.' </p> <p>Arguably we won't get more women coming though as artistic directors unless the next generation can break through the glass ceiling. So what are the prejudices women still confront? That they lack the obsessive drive of their male peers? That they are better working in intimate studio spaces rather than huge venues like the Olivier? 'I would absolutely contest that,' insists Kavanaugh, 'I've worked almost entirely on rather large stages from Stratford to Birmingham Rep, I like doing epic pieces.' </p> <p>Theatre productions are risky, expensive and often cast at the last minute. No wonder it's tempting for male artistic directors to call in the chaps they already know - and genuinely intend to try out someone new next time. And positive discrimination for women doesn't always help. 'Last year the rumour went round that Nick Hytner needed a woman's play at the National because he already had black and gay productions,' one female producer said, 'and it can feel like tokenism.' </p> <p>Women simply have to fight harder to maintain their careers. After the huge success of Baby Doll , everything went quiet for Lucy Bailey. 'I have to confess that I wondered if I'd been a boy whether I'd have been instantly offered the next show and the next. A single man, or indeed a married man can play the field on a most pragmatic level. But I had small children so I wasn't going to every party around town.' </p> <p>It comes as a shock to find that a woman didn't get to direct at the National until Nancy Meckler in 1981, 19 years after it was founded. Today Meckler is in huge demand at the National and the RSC, as well as being joint artistic director of touring company Shared Experience, but even she acknowledges, 'I used to get quite low because sometimes I only had one show a year. I don't want to sound churlish because clearly artistic directors do invite me now, but in the past it tended to be the writers rather than the artistic directors who invited me in. I did one of Pam Gem's very first plays so she would suggest me, or I had a relationship with Sam Shepard for a while. Or when I did Rose recently at the National it was Martin Sherman who wanted me to direct that play.' </p> <p>Abigail Morris is one of the handful of women who actually runs a building. Since she took over as artistic director in 1992, London's Soho Theatre has been transformed as a venue for new writing and comedy. But it hasn't always been easy. 'People think of theatre as a very politically aware industry,' she tells me, 'and we assume, for example, that it will be good for women that there are a lot of gay men. But I've certainly come across real sexism, from people who would consider themselves very left-wing. I look fairly young and at one of the first artistic director conferences I went to at the National, I remember someone came up to me and said, \"Yeah, I'll have a tea, two sugars.\" And because I'm a nice person I did it.' Morris, who has three children, tells another horror story about an Arts Council meeting where a gay theatre director refused to sit next to her, declaring: 'Ugh, I don't like to sit next to pregnant women!' </p> <p>Of course there are supportive men in the industry. When Michael Boyd arrived at the RSC, he declared: 'Mea culpa, I am very aware of the lack of female directors and we're doing all we can do to address it.' And there is definitely a feeling that regional theatres such as West Yorkshire Playhouse, Birmingham Rep and Bristol Old Vic have been more proactive than London's main theatres. 'They encourage not only women, but young women,' says Kavanaugh. </p> <p>Nick Hytner himself says: 'I worry it might be the perception that there is a male closed shop and we probably have to work harder to combat that. It puzzles me why are there are relatively few women directors who want to put themselves forward to run buildings. There's certainly no shortage of talent among women directors, but it would be idle to pretend that amongwriters, directors and adminstrators there is an equitable balance.' He adds that only one in five plays submitted to the National is by a woman, female playwrights please take note. </p> <p>But is it reactionary to talk about gender? Do women directors even define themselves as 'female'. 'I know I have a sensibility towards exploring sensual relationships,' agrees Lucy Bailey. 'You hope your work escapes interpretation on that kind of level, that the muscularity and boldness of the piece puts it into an area of just terrific theatre rather than theatre directed by a woman.' 'I'd far rather be known as a director than a woman director,' agrees Tamara Harvey ( One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest ). 'Even having this discussion is frustrating. But whenever I've done mail-outs I'm very aware that all the artistic directors I'm writing to are men.' </p> <p>'For me, directing is directing with your whole self and every bit of your experience,' says Abigail Morris. 'And knowing what it's like to have a child is one more tool you bring to the mix. Though I do remember someone said, \"Oh you're not going to get all mumsy and do plays about mothers now, are you?\"'Sarah Esdaile who directed the gritty death row drama, Coyote on a Fence , is unapologetic about her gender. 'I've been known to put make-up on in my notes session. In essence I'd say my femaleness is an asset, and my work is hugely informed by the fact that I'm female. In terms of emotional openness, there are going to be inevitable advantages to being a woman or a sensitive man or a gay man. Is there discrimination? Yes. But the best way to handle any prejudice when dealing with older male actors is to be good at what you do - rather than dwelling on the inequality.' Esdaile, currently directing a new play about women's experience of prison with the all-female theatre group Clean Break, insists, ' Coyote was about two men on death row, but I didn't feel my empathy with their situation was compro mised because I'm not a bloke.' </p> <p>Many critics assume a woman director will automatically bring a feminist reading to a play, but surely it's just one of many choices? 'Our productions sometimes get judged differently, which drives me nuts,' says Harvey. 'When I directed the all-female Much Ado About Nothing , the response was, \"It's good but it didn't really exploit the feminist viewpoint.\" But I wanted any double meanings and interesting paradoxes to be thrown up, not to be rammed down the audience's throat.' Kavanaugh agrees: 'It suggests that woman directors are somehow working in a marginalised area and should only be political but cannot be part of the mainstream. Personally I am a classicist. I don't see myself at all as working on the fringes.' At only 34, she is tipped as a future artistic director of the RSC. But as she recalls: 'It's true I have directed mostly comedy. I really love doing it, it's probably where my strength is and I like doing plays that are language-based. But I wonder if part of the reason I'm asked is because I'm a woman. I think it's more likely someone is going to ask me to direct The Comedy of Errors than King Lear .' </p> <p>Of course, some women considered major directorial forces have no desire to run a building. Phyllida Lloyd admits: 'Once you have a taste for the freelance life of the director, the selfish life some might call it, you have no desire to spend all of your time writing business plans or choosing cushion covers for the foyer. People say \"You're not taking the opportunity to really formulate policy\", but for me, policy is the production in front of me.' </p> <p>But, for many, childcare is still the key problem. According to Arlene Phillips, currently directing Starlight Express in Manchester, 'As a woman you are committed to giving 100 per cent to your family as well as your work. You feel torn, as it is still perceived that a woman's place is in the home. The funny thing is, if there's a crisis between your work and a child, people wouldn't instantly think it would affect a male director. From my experience, female directors with families appear to carry a great deal more guilt than their male counterparts.' </p> <p>And Lloyd (herself a millionaire after the success of Mamma Mia!) says: 'The question for me is how can you direct the Ring Cycle and have children - unless you have a partner who is going to look after them? If you're rehearsing from 10am to 10pm, you have to have someone there to run the home. It's like a fork in the road: and that's why very few of us have families. There are no creches at English National Opera or the National.' For Fiona Buffini, directing the RSC's Two Gentleman of Verona , gender isn't the only stumbling block. 'I think with any profession in England, the class system is just below the surface. You know they've taken all the locks off the doors and we still stand outside and knock. I'm not like most people in the theatre establishment and I think the fact that I've not been to Oxbridge is just as relevant. I'm Irish, I'm a grammar-school girl and I'm a woman. And if you're a bloke you're more comfortable employing a bloke.' </p> <p>But then theatre is only a microcosm of society. 'I don't think anyone would dispute that in the broad workplace things are still not equal, so why on earth would they be more equal in the theatre?' asks Kavanaugh. Harvey agrees. 'I was very aware at the press photo call for Cuckoo's Nest that there was only one woman photographer in a room full of men, so there's work to be done there!'</p>",
  "<p>Ten years ago the Australian public was told that building a casino in the Victorian capital of Melbourne was a sure-fire winning hand that would solve urban blight, create jobs and generate billions in revenues for the government while entertaining the masses. </p> <p>For a few it has been an ace hand, a licence to print money and generate - or hide - stupendous profits that are providing the platforms for Australian gambling moguls, like Kerry Packer, to grab a share of Britain's expanding gambling industry. </p> <p>But the vast majority have been handed a joker that has lost untold billions, blighted communities and provided a perfect incubator for organised crime to create and launder illicit gains. </p> <p>Australia's bitter experience could offer some unhappy precedents as Britain considers the odds of being able to avoid the pitfalls that could arise from increasing the size of its gambling industry. </p> <p>Gamblers have lost more than \u00a33.2 billion at Melbourne's Crown Casino since the massive complex - five times the size of the nation's largest shopping centre - has been open. </p> <p>The nation's state governments - who licence gaming and gambling companies - have become addicted to the billions in taxes and fees generated by gambling and would not risk closing them and having to raise taxes elsewhere to make up the revenue. </p> <p>British members of parliament who visited Australia earlier this year to study the industry were taken on tours of inner-city communities damaged by gambling and warned that a casino culture was a social disaster. </p> <p>'It is devastating and the damage is irreversible,' says Mike Hill, the con vener of Communities Acting on Pokie Problems, a lobby group opposed to gambling, whose members accompanied the delegation on their tour of gambling hot spots. For every addict - and there are estimated to be 400,000 in Australia - there are another 10 people who are directly affected by gambling, such as wives, children or colleagues, according to CAPP. </p> <p>Australia is now the world's most gambling-addicted nation, with more problem gamblers per capita than any other nation. </p> <p>The British MPs John Greenway and Baroness Golding, members of the joint committee on the gambling bill, were taken to see how high concentrations of poker machines in suburban pubs can ravage a community. </p> <p>Most of the damage outside the casinos is done by fruit machines, also known as pokies, and branded by watchdogs as the crack-cocaine of gambling. </p> <p>'Britain will have enormous problems if it lets pokies run loose,' says James Doughney, academic, author and gaming industry analyst. </p> <p>'What will inevitably happen in Britain is that more than 60 per cent of casino earnings will come from a relatively small percentage of users, typically about 15 per cent,' Mr Doughney says. </p> <p>He dismisses as nonsense the government's claims that it can achieve socially responsible gambling. 'It fails to address the inherent contradiction of trying to protect people from an industry in whose growth it has a vested interest.' </p> <p>Casino management claims it has met its side of the deal: hundreds of new jobs, billions in revenue and handsome entertainment complexes that millions of people visit for a good time. </p> <p>In Victoria taxes on poker machines account for almost two-thirds of state gambling taxes, or one-fifth of the state's taxation. </p> <p>'It is a crime inflicted on the community by the government. It has been an absolute curse on the state of Victoria. It is a money-making venture that maximises returns by ensuring that people lose a lot of money,' he says. </p> <p>There is also little evidence in Australia - or the United States - that casinos have helped to revitalise run-down sections of cities and led to job growth, a key promise made by their champions in Britain. </p> <p>In America's Atlantic City, the expansion of casinos had a dramatic effect on property values, creating a windfall for some owners but serious problems for many others. </p> <p>Melbourne's casino has given rise to economic imbalances, with the money being spent at its numerous bars, restaurants and theatres diverted from similar businesses outside the casino precinct. </p> <p>A spokesman for Melbourne's casino denied allegations that it had become a mecca for organised crime as both a source of revenue and a means of laundering the proceeds of crime to avoid detection. </p> <p>But John Silvester, Australia's leading crime writer with more than 25 years' experience of the local scene, insists: 'There is a substantial link as large amounts of illegal drug money is gambled.' Elite gambling dens, such as the Mahogany Room at the Crown Casino, became such a haunt of crime bosses that police video surveillance of their activities there resulted in successful prosecutions against them. Criminals in the drug trade are so cash-rich that they often throw their money around like confetti, according to police. </p> <p>Victoria's chief superintendent of police Christine Nixon recently said organised crime used any resource it could to launder money and that there was evidence it had occurred at the Melbourne casino. Meanwhile in New South Wales police said that the Russian mafia was running prostitution rackets in the Sydney casino. </p> <p>A recent conference in Melbourne was told that of 97 organised criminal groups identified by the Australian Crime Commission, a national investigatory body, more than 40 were operating out of Victoria. </p> <p>The only good news is that there has been a drop-off in illegal gambling, a traditional pastime of the Australian criminal community. </p> <p>For those holding the sector's winning hand, the gambling companies, the gains have been stupendous. In the past 10 years market capitalisation at Tabcorp, owner of casinos and poker machines, has grown from \u00a3276m to almost \u00a33bn. It now handles more than 700 million bets every year. </p> <p>With the company diversified throughout Australia and across three sectors of the industry - wagering, gaming machines and casinos - there is a widespread expectation that it will move overseas. </p> <p>If it does, it will be following another Australian with overseas ambitions: Kerry Packer. The media and gambling tycoon, best known in Britain for funding the commercial cricket revolution - and for having lost \u00a311m at London's Crockfords Casino, is joining British gambling and property investor Damian Aspinall, to invest \u00a3310m in a chain of casino around the United Kingdom, with at least three in Scotland and two in England. </p> <p>The chain is expected to be called Aspers, in part after the upmarket Aspinall's Casino in London, in which Packer's other listed company, Consolidated Press Holdings, has a stake. </p> <p>If the Australian experience is any guide for Britain then it is only a matter of time before the doors open on Las Vegas-style betting palaces where the odds are stacked against the punter and the house always wins.</p>",
  "<p>For a moment forget about the charge sheet against Messrs Bush and Blair - the alleged lies about WMD or the illegality of the invasion of Iraq - and glance at the bigger picture. Global terrorism, global poverty and global warming form a toxic trio that promise a catastrophe that will make the horrors of 9/11 look like the Boston Tea Party.</p> <p>Do I exaggerate? In the Middle East untold thousands of Arabs are being slaughtered by US warplanes and artillery, supported by the British, to impose Western democracy on Iraq at the point of a gun. In Beirut, once dismembered by civil war but now at ease with itself, the young parade through the squares with grace and elegance. But listen to what they say and you discover a coruscating sense of humiliation and a deepening rage against America, startling in this most genuinely Westernised Arab state.</p> <p>Aliya Saidi, a young lecturer at the American University, was discomfited to be asked about Bush, Cheney and Rumsfeld: 'I don't want to say I hate them but they are terrible people.' After an embarrassed pause, she added: 'I don't know if I should say that; my husband is American.'</p> <p>The resentment against the US administration (not the American people who are pre sumed to have been duped) crosses all classes and backgrounds. 'If the US continues to despise the Arab nation in this way,' the owner of a sportswear shop, Hadi Baalbaki, warns, 'I fear the whole Arab nation will form itself into one big al-Qaeda.'</p> <p>Richard Clark, Bush's former anti-terrorism coordinator who took charge in the White House on 9/11 and who retains close contact with intelligence agencies around the world, tells me that 'by almost any measure... the war on terrorism is being lost'. He cites the rate of terrorist atrocities, more than doubled since 9/11, and insists that the number of terrorists has risen to around 100,000 active 'jihadists' around the world. Chillingly, he believes these zealots are likely to be supported 'philosophically, politically, and perhaps with money' by upwards of 700 million Muslims - roughly half the global population of the Islamic faithful.</p> <p>When I was first in Lebanon, some 30 years ago, the young Palestinians in the refugee camps were taught how to use Kalashnikovs. Now, two generations on and still without any escape from their humiliation, they live in an emotional swamp of resentment and anger. Ahmad Iskandar is in his early twenties, edu cated and courteous and speaks as if explaining the self-evident to a backward pupil: 'I am ready to explode myself in Israel.' Ready to be a suicide bomber? 'It is not suicide, sorry. It is a martyr operation.' And what about the innocents who will die? 'Our heart is now dead. They make us forget everything. Just to go and kill them.' And he shrugs his shoulders.</p> <p>Already the poison of al-Qaeda is seeping into the Palestinian camps. Munir Maqhdar, a refugee, is holed up in south Lebanon where he leads a small band of gun-toting guerrillas who swagger around him as he says 'anybody who supports the killing of Arabs and Muslim people in Afghanistan and Iraq is a legitimate target. Any Arab or Muslim organisation is entitled to take revenge if the opportunity arises... the White House has to demonstrate that the historic injustice perpetrated against Palestinians matters every bit as much as the protection of the state of Israel.' According to the UN, 60 million Arabs live on less than two dollars a day, the population is growing rapidly, and unemployment is set to double in five years. The finance director of the Central Bank of Lebanon, Youssef el-Khalil, says that young people have a choice between corruption or fundamentalism. 'Fundamentalism is very much seen as the alternative to corruption... the war on terrorism has to address the war on poverty.'</p> <p>The neocons who hold sway in Washington do not flinch under this kind of fire. For them, in the words of Richard Perle: 'We are winning the war on terrorism. We have killed a significant number. We have put terrorists in many parts of the world on the defensive.'</p> <p>Try telling that to the two doctors I met in Ethiopia, who told me of impoverished young Muslims in the south-east of Ethiopia who 'are being indoctrinated under the coverage of religion with the beliefs and attitudes of al-Qaeda' and who, in some cases, are already in training for future operations. Try telling it to the American diplomat in Addis Ababa who gave me an 'off the record' briefing, holed up in the US compound which, like US embassies around the world, is protected from terrorist attack by armed guards, concrete barriers and razor-wire. He showed me a list of 'wahabi' clerics and business leaders in Ethiopia suspected of allegiance to al-Qaeda and volunteered that US special forces are now operating alongside Ethiopian soldiers in an effort to break up al-Qaeda cells in the Ogaden region. And how were they doing? He shrugged: 'We have already lost the war against terrorism in Africa.'</p> <p>Try telling the Ethiopian Prime Minister, Meles Zenawi, that 'we' are winning the war on terror. 'Yes,' he confirms (for the first time), US forces are indeed engaged in military operations alongside their Ethiopian counterparts but this 'police work' is only part of the solution - 'the most important part is fighting poverty'. This is not so much an issue of morality but of urgent necessity in a country stricken by familiar but excruciating indices of misery. 'There is a very frustrated population that sees no light at the end of the tunnel and therefore is susceptible to all sorts of saviours, false saviours,' he says.</p> <p>Ethiopia's 70 million population divides its religious affiliations almost equally between the Orthodox Church and Islam. Traditionally this has not been a cause of strife and inter-marriage is commonplace. But you now hear rage against America on the streets of Addis Ababa just as in Baghdad or Beirut. Meles is a member of Tony Blair's Commission for Africa though he has no illusions about its potential to deliver salvation. But in a continent where thousands of children die every day from preventable diseases and where (despite the ravages of HIV) more than 300 million live on less than a dollar a day, you are bound to grasp any outstretched arm and twist it to your advantage.</p> <p>As it is the grotesque distortions of the global market mean that for every dollar the West dispatches to Africa in the form of aid, two dollars are clawed back through subsidies and tariff barriers: a monumental rip-off by the rich as they instruct the poor to accept 'free' trade or else.</p> <p>A growing number of Africans, especially the young (mostly unemployed), use radio, television and the internet to keep themselves disconcertingly well-informed. The hypocrisies and injustices that are inflicted on them drives Meles Zanawi to warn that Africa, no less than the Middle East, could become the source of tomorrow's 9/11. 'Whether it is people in the rural areas of Ethiopia or the centre of Manhattan, we are in the same boat,' he comments, echoing outgoing European commissioner Chris Patten, who says, 'sometimes people are very angry, when they think that fairness is denied them until the crack of doom'.</p> <p>The president of the World Bank, James Wolfensohn, tells me 'it is not that someone who is poor immediately becomes a terrorist... but what are the children going to do, young people with similar values to our own, can't get a job and are frustrated in everything they try to do?'</p> <p>As it is, the West can't even find the resolve to meet its UN 'Millennium Goals' - to reduce world poverty by 50 per cent by 2015. According to Wolfensohn and Gordon Brown, this target date, at the present rate of progress, will be overshot by more than 100 years. There is no excuse: as the Chancellor tells me in great frustration, 'What is lacking is the political will'.</p> <p>It can be done. If every Western nation were to contribute 0.7 per cent of GDP to overseas aid, write off the debt of poorest countries, and eliminate agricultural subsidies to their own farmers, they could find in the order of $785 billion dollars annually for development aid - more than 12 times the present commitment.</p> <p>Which takes us - or should take us - from global poverty to global warming. It is the greatest challenge facing humanity, to combat both at once - to deliver justice, fairness and prosperity to the poor without destroying the planet in the process. Already we are consuming the Earth's natural but finite resources faster than they can be replenished. Already Britain's chief scientific advisor, Sir David King, tells us global warming is a greater threat than global terrorism.</p> <p>So what happens when the poor have their just deserts? Will we see the melting of the ice-caps, catastrophic floods that drown hundreds of thousands of people and turn millions into refugees and famished migrants? Will we all perish in some Siberian or Saharan Armageddon? Or find ourselves caught in a Malthusian end-game as we perish for lack of food and water? Or will we start to control our profligate use of carbon fuels and persuade whoever wins the American election that the resources of the planet must be more equitably shared?</p> <p>As with winning the war on poverty, so with global warming: it is a matter of political will. Which is why a deeply frustrated president of the World Bank says: 'If someone came here from Mars and looked at the way we run the place, he'd get back in his spaceship and go back to Mars and say, \"You don't have to worry about them, they are going to destroy themselves\".' Which means, as I argue in The New World War , we had better get serious about global terrorism, global poverty, and global warming.

  "The American election is ending as it began: under the shadow of the War on Terror. Within two hours of Osama bin Laden's message to America, both campaigns reacted to the haunting video that will dominate the twilight days of this ferocious campaign. Top aides to President George Bush arranged a statement on the airport tarmac in Toledo, Ohio. Similarly Senator John Kerry's staffers organised an interview with a TV station in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. <p>For a brief moment there was an outbreak of that rarest of commodities: unity. Bush took no questions but offered an olive branch to Kerry. 'Americans will not be intimidated or influenced by an enemy of our country. I am sure Senator Kerry agrees with this,' he said. Kerry struck an even more harmonious tone. 'All of us in this country are united. Democrats, Republicans, there is no such thing,' he said. </p> <p>The truce didn't last. Kerry could not resist bringing up his frequent accusation that an opportunity was missed at the battle of Tora Bora to catch bin Laden. At a later rally Bush accused Kerry of politicising national security and called his words 'shameful'. Democrat aides then held an emergency conference call with reporters to push out the line that Kerry had not yet seen the tape when he made his comments. A news conference was organised and Kerry again appealed for unity with no reference to Tora Bora. But the tone has now been set. </p> <p>While the candidates will probably remain above the fray, Republican and Democratic surrogates are engaged in an air war over the bin Laden tape. The last few days of this election campaign will now see a bitter fight over the most hated man in America. And most strategists agree that campaigning on the issue of terrorism is Bush's home turf. </p> <p>Yet the drama of bin Laden's message disguised a simple fact: this election - the first after 11 September - has always been conducted in the heat of the War on Terror. Bin Laden's video was both a theatrical intervention and a reminder that honeyed words from both sides will not change the fundamentals of the last year's fierce campaigning. </p> <p>For if the two camps agree that they want Osama bin Laden caught or killed, they disagree on pretty much everything else. That will not change on Tuesday. Whoever emerges as the winner - whether via a victory at the polls or after a court battle - will inherit a divided country. One poll last week asked voters if they would support the winning candidate if it was not their own. For patriotic Americans in a time of war the answer to such a question should be an easy 'yes'. A stunning 62 per cent said 'no'. </p> <p>On the main street of Steubenville, Ohio, the Democratic and Republican campaign offices are next door to each other. Both are decked out in red, white and blue signs and ribbons. The only obvious difference is a radio placed on the street outside the Republican door that blares out the daily rants of the right-wing shock jock Rush Limbaugh. </p> <p>But the identical offices in this small Ohio town mask two utterly different views of America and the world. In the Democrats' office last week a young soldier sat next to his wife and worked the phones for Kerry. Stephen, 27, who wouldn't give his last name, is heading back to Iraq this week. His unit is based outside Falluja and he has spent his leave working to unseat George Bush. 'I just want to do my part,' he said with quiet forcefulness. </p> <p>Yet next door in the Republican office Anthony Falzarano burned with equal conviction. He supports the war. But his election is not about Iraq. It is about values and having a man of faith in the White House. 'We are the real America here in Ohio. We don't want homosexual marriage. This is not the socialist east and west coasts,' he said. </p> <p>The soldier and the shopkeeper are just yards apart on the same street, in the same town in the same state. But it will take more than simply electing a new President to bring them together. </p> <p>This election has now boiled down to Steubenville and the hundreds of towns just like it across the 'Big Three' of Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida. These states are the grand prizes of the election battleground with 68 votes in the electoral college. Both campaigns believe that whoever wins two out of the three will probably take the White House. It can be done without them - which explains both campaigns recent interest in Hawaii - but it will be tough. </p> <p>In the heartlands of Massachusetts and Texas, the battle has never really been joined. But in the 'Big Three' the campaign roar has been deafening. Both sides are now spending about $9 million a day, most of it in these three states. </p> <p>At the moment the race in all three areas is as tight as the national polls. 'The election is days away and we are right back where we started, in a toss-up,' said top pollster John Zogby of Zogby International. Bush often leads in Florida, but in Ohio, which every Republican President elected has won, Kerry is usually ahead. Kerry also holds a narrow lead in Pennsylvania. But the situation in all of the states could easily reverse. </p> <p>Each state has its own issues, which often dominate local politics more than they do national debates. In Ohio it is the economy that is key. The state has lost a quarter of a million jobs, mainly in manufacturing, since Bush took power. In Pennsylvania's wooded hills it is hunting and guns that strike a chord. Huge posters showing Kerry as a poodle stand beside Pennsylvanian roads with the slogan: 'This dog doesn't hunt.' In Florida, a mix of Jewish retirees, Deep South traditions and Hispanic incomers has made for a hotchpotch of ethnic interests that each side must pander to. The 'Big Three' are very different places. But they have one thing in common: division. </p> <p>Bin Laden's late intervention is unlikely to change that. In fact, the Bush administration had known about the bin Laden tape before it aired on al-Jazeera. They had been warned by the government of Qatar, where the station is based, that the tape existed and top State Department officials had urged the Qataris not to broadcast it. Their request went unheeded. </p> <p>But for Bush's top strategists it is hard to see how the tape is bad news. Privately many Republicans feel that the long-awaited 'October surprise' has finally landed and it hands them the advantage. 'People get scared and rally around the flag. I don't think the effect will be huge, but even a small change could be important,' said Michael Lewis-Beck, a political scientist at the University of Iowa. </p> <p>The bin Laden video also served to immediately knock several troublesome anti-Bush news stories off the media agenda. After a week of negative press about the President, bin Laden has handed the administration an escape from a damaging news cycle. The sight of the terrorist's face on American television screens will only reinforce Bush's warnings about terrorist attacks and his message about backing the commander-in-chief in a time of war. It may also provide a reason for raising America's terror threat level. </p> <p>Yet Americans' differing reactions to that message spell out their divisions. 'The Republicans are scaremongering. They want people to be afraid,' said Victoria Bender, a Democrat campaign worker in Ohio. </p> <p>Across the 'Big Three' there are simply two different visions of reality. One half of each state either sees the war in Iraq as a costly mistake or a vital front in the battle against terrorism. One side sees Bush as a stalwart pursuer of bin Laden, the other sees a failure to catch him. One side sees a catastrophic loss of jobs amid growing poverty, the other sees tax cut-induced growth and a recovery from recession. One side sees the entry of religious beliefs into political life, the other sees the return of faith and family values. </p> <p>The riverside town of Butler, Pennsylvania, is not prosperous. But nor is it poor. It sits in a swath of forested hills but is not far from the suburbs of Pittsburgh. Valarie Nold holds the fort in Butler for Red America. 'I am a huge Bush fan,' said the 44-year-old nurse. 'I don't really like the war, but I support George Bush's views on the family and he is a conservative.' A few blocks away office manager Ed Johnson can barely contain his anger at the mention of Bush. 'This administration disgusts me,' he said. </p> <p>The passions run deep across the swing states. Relations between Steubenville's neighbouring campaign offices are not good. Things have even become physical as each side's proximity to the other grates on party volunteers' nerves. 'We live in perfect harmony,' said one Democratic volunteer sarcastically. </p> <p>In Florida, America's political divide has turned darkly comic. Last week a Democratic supporter drove his car at Katherine Harris, the Republican official who was Florida's controversial secretary of state during the 2000 recount. The driver later said he was exercising his 'political expression'. Yet on the same day Florida's newspapers also gave wide coverage to a man who attacked his girlfriend after she revealed she was voting for Kerry. He eventually had to be subdued by police with taser stun guns. </p> <p>In America's swing states there are now few swing voters left. The fierce political fight has left little middle-ground for the undecided to stand upon. </p> <p>That, however, is where Larry Barr has positioned himself. Raking leaves outside the house where he was born in the Pennsylvania hamlet of Meridian, Barr said each candidate is flawed. But he still plans to vote. 'If you don't vote, then you lose the right to bitch about the result,' he said, spitting tobacco juice into the leaves. </p> <p>That bitching has already begun. The spectre of the Florida debacle in 2000 hangs heavily over the 2004 race. There is every possibility that this Tuesday will not produce a definite result. Both sides have armies of lawyers on 24- hour standby and at least seven states could be the subject of legal fights if the result is close. </p> <p>Across Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida, lawyers have already locked horns paving the way for lengthy court fights if the election is close. Arguments have centred around Republican efforts to keep newly registered Democrats from voting. Democrats complain this is an attempt to suppress their vote. Republicans say they are just making sure the rules are obeyed. </p> <p>But behind the lawsuits both sides have waged a dirty campaign. Republicans allege that many of the new voters are fraudulent and complain that some precincts in Ohio now have more registered voters than actual inhabitants. At the same time Democrats have complained of mysterious phone calls telling them their polling stations have been moved. Or - illegally - offering to pick up their absentee ballots. Last week the Justice Department announced it was sending 1,000 monitors to the polls in sensitive states to ensure things go smoothly. </p> <p>Eugene Jones certainly hopes they do. In 2000 the black office worker failed to vote in Florida after being stopped by police on the way to the polls. They told him incorrectly that his car lights were broken and the vehicle could not be driven. Now, he says, he is not going to be intimidated. 'I am voting this time,' said the 31-year-old. 'That same white police officer is out there, but this time I am voting.' </p> <p>Whether it is on election night, or several months hence, a winner will emerge. Whoever he is, he will face the same issues. Bin Laden will still be the most wanted and hated man in America whether it is President Kerry or President Bush who tries to pursue him. The Iraq war and its role in the War on Terror will still split the country. </p> <p>In downtown Orlando, Eugene Jones described himself as a military veteran who sees the war as a disaster. But his fellow Floridian, and fellow veteran, Bill McGee, saw it as a victory for freedom. 'It's tough but its all about spreading freedom,' McGee said. </p> <p>The social issues that arouse passions across the political spectrum will also not go away. Kerry has bent over backward to appeal to the conservative voters who make up Bush's core base. But the anti-abortion right still dog his every campaign stop, holding up pictures of bloody embryos and quotes from the Bible. They will not be appeased by any Kerry administration that is pro-choice and committed to the separation of church and state. </p> <p>A Bush victory will be a huge boost to the religious right, to the horror of many Democrats. Many experts believe Bush will try to tackle the abortion issue, allowing it to be banned by individual states. He would be helped if a second term allows him to appoint conservative judges to the Supreme Court. In Steubenville's Republican campaign office, there is little doubt as to who Bush will owe his power to. 'If Bush wins, it will be the Christian right that put him in office. He will have to listen to us,' said Falzarano with obvious relish. </p> <p>Essentially there is no longer a political home in the centre. Experts say voters' allegiance to the candidates has become a tribal issue based on character and not rooted in policy positions. </p> <p>Americans are now simply choosing sides. Last week that fact was on display at an Ohio airport hangar as Bush addressed a 5,000-strong crowd of supporters in the Democratic industrial heartland of Youngstown. Beside him stood two Democratic defectors, Senator Zell Miller and Youngstown Mayor George McKelvey. Yet far from being the voice of moderation, both Democrats savaged Kerry as bloodily as any far-right Republican. 'The Hollywood leftists don't represent our values, our heart or our soul,' yelled McKelvey. The crowd cheered. </p> <p>Tuesday's vote has become just one battle in a continuing conflict. Whichever side loses will believe the election was effectively stolen. And the image of bin Laden making his threats will be the excuse the losing side will use to beat the victor. </p> <p>If Kerry wins, Republicans will see it as a betrayal of a wartime President and will accuse Democratic voters of obeying a mass murderer. If Bush wins, Democrats will believe victory was snatched from them by a man with the blood of 3,000 dead Americans on his hands. They will see bin Laden as having scared Americans into voting for a President they see as al-Qaeda's best recruiting sergeant. </p> <p>The political and cultural wars of America will also continue. As the Republicans will probably still control Congress, they will make any Kerry administration an exercise in political trench warfare. But if the Democrats are kept in opposition, the party could well be plunged into a civil war between its right and left wings. </p> <p>At the Youngstown rally last week, Ohio's governor Bob Taft appeared alongside Bush on the makeshift podium. Ohio's supreme importance in the election was uppermost in his mind as he urged everyone to go out and vote. Then he introduced his President by telling the audience a simple fact. 'We are the front line in the battle for America's future,' he said. </p> <p>But that war will not end on 2 November. Bin Laden's appearance on the scene has only served to remind America that the political war dividing their nation also extends to another war, one involving real bullets and real bombs.</p>",
  "Terrorism is the use of force or the threat of force to make people - whether individuals or states - behave in a certain way. It depends on fear. And it often, though not always, works. Last week Osama bin Laden told the American people and their elected leaders that, if they did not behave in a certain way, serious consequences, involving massive loss of life and property, would follow. Given that, in almost the same breath, bin Laden claimed responsibility for 11 September, his threats, despite the massive efforts to ensure America's security in the past three years, are credible. <p>Bin Laden's capacity to launch terror strikes is now limited, but he will be pleased with the impact he has made. His project has always been to radicalise those who have hitherto shunned his fanatical message. In this he is little different from any other revolutionary political activist. Yet, through the use of modern media, bin Laden now has the sort of global influence achieved by only some states and a few world figures.</p> <p>Early indications are, thankfully, that his impact on the US electorate has been limited. Both President George W Bush and his challenger, Senator John Kerry, have resisted the temptation to score partisan points in one of the most hotly contested elections in memory. However, victory depends on a few voters in a few key states. It is too early to discount the possibility that bin Laden's intervention could make a major, indeed historic, difference, something that would be hugely damaging for democracy everywhere.</p> <p>There are many flaws in American democracy: the electoral college system dilutes the popular vote; armies of corporate lobbyists contribute to a colossal campaign cost; the legal process to decide any contested poll is unsavoury and unsatisfactory, and a spectre of electoral corruption hangs over the poll. None the less, it is hard not to admire the sheer verve of US politics. The huge crowds at rallies are not seen at political events in Britain. Voter turnout may be low, (traditionally about half of those eligible) but this time voter registration is up dramatically, and citizens across the country are engaged in this election to a degree we should envy. An incredible 63 million people watched, at home or in bars or at 'debate parties', the first of the televised contests between the candidates.</p> <p>Such engagement, embodying the liberal democratic principles on which America is based, is an example to the world. If a mass murderer holed up in a cave in southwest Asia can sway any election, let alone that of America, we will all be losers. We will be double losers if Bush profits from this 'October Surprise'. The American system has always represented a noble aspiration. Recently, those ideals have sometimes seemed distant.</p> <p>Bush has seen the rest of the world as a threat, not as a source of help and goodwill. A series of unforced errors has made Iraq a far tougher problem than it ever needed to be. At home Bush has torn up initiatives that might tackle global warming. He is the first President since Hoover to preside over a net loss in American jobs and the looming deficit, perhaps as high as $4.5 trillion, threatens global repercussions. The influence of the Christian Right, on issues such as stem cell research, gay marriage and abortion, is profoundly worrying. Finally, the current administration bears responsibility for the human rights abuses of Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo. Bush benefits from an insular society's natural fear after a savagely attack. But this is a negative way to earn votes and offers little reassurance of a change of tone in a re-elected administration.</p> <p>We believe Kerry would do better, particularly when it comes to building the global alliances against terrorism and other threats that are so essential. There may not be much to choose between these two millionaires and Kerry may at times be indecisive and uncharismatic, but the senator's sympathies are positive and thoughtful, his style more humane and he offers a vision of a safer, better world.</p> <p>After more than 200 years, the US system remains the best version of running a society yet devised. We hope there will be a clear winner on Tuesday who is able to reconcile the red and blue states and we hope men like bin Laden will have had no part in choosing him.</p>",
  "<p>War in Iraq; unemployment in the rust-belt; hanging chads - American voters may have any number of issues uppermost in their minds as they cast their votes this week, but the value of the dollar in their pockets is unlikely to be among them. However, the mighty greenback, for many years the symbol of America's global economic hegemony, is wobbling, and the outcome of this bitterly contested election could help determine how far, and how fast, it falls. </p> <p>With a current account deficit of more than 5 per cent of GDP, and growth prospects under threat from $50-a-barrel oil, rising interest rates and an overstretched consumer sector, experts have little doubt that the greenback is overvalued. In fact, the correction has already begun: the dollar hit an eight-month low against the euro and a six-month low against the yen last week, after a respite over the summer. The presidential election could be just the catalyst the markets have been waiting for to spark a more sustained readjustment. </p> <p>'People are bearish because of the scale of the imbalances in the economy. Historically, current account deficits of this kind have been associated with pretty major currency reversals,' says Richard Iley of BNP Paribas. </p> <p>'There is no question, the dollar is definitely going down,' says Adrian Foster, head of currency at Dresdner. </p> <p>In the very short run, what investors would most like is a clean result next week. The dollar usually bounces immediately after presidential elections, but in 2000, it fell 4 per cent on a trade-weighted basis between November and the end of the year, as Bush and Gore wrangled over 'hanging chads' and recounts. </p> <p>With teams of lawyers standing by for both camps this time, and little to choose between them in the polls, another pro tracted tussle - and another anxious month for the markets - looks likely. </p> <p>Once a victor is eventually declared, though, analysts believe a win for John Kerry could cause a short sharp shock for the greenback, while the familiar face of George W in the oval office might postpone the inevitable for a while. </p> <p>Ironically, one reason Kerry's arrival in the White House could be bearish for the dollar is that he would be more likely to try to get to grips with the $400 billion budget deficit that is Bush Jr's legacy. 'When you're a new guy in office, it's good to get your dirty work out of the way early, in terms of cutting spending, slowing the economy down,' says Steve Andrew, chief economist at F&amp;C. That could force the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates more slowly, and put downward pressure on the dollar. </p> <p>'Kerry is broadly dollar-negative,' agrees Bill O'Neill, global strategist at JP Morgan. 'It's akin to the environment after the Reagan period, where you had fiscal consolidation and an easy Fed policy. That coincided with a soft dollar.' </p> <p>After capital controls were abolished in 1973, and the dollar was first allowed to float freely, it climbed during Gerald Ford's Republican presidency, from 1974 to 1977, and slid under Democrat Jimmy Carter, between 1977 and 1981. In the 1980s, 'Reaganomics' threw conventional left-right logic into disarray. </p> <p>Reagan initially presided over a great spike in the dollar's value, as he cut taxes and plunged into the red to pump up economic expansion. He was then persuaded that it had become too strong for the good of the US and the global economy; and in the era when currency fluctuations were a matter for international diplomacy, the G7 group of rich nations agreed to orchestrate an orderly depreciation, in what became known as the Plaza agreement of 1985. Two years later, in the so-called Louvre accord, they decided it was time to put a floor under the market. </p> <p>Under Clinton, particularly in his second term, as the fervour that underpinned the dotcom boom sparked talk of a 'new paradigm' and a 'productivity miracle', having a strong dollar became a matter of macho economic pride. </p> <p>Since the economy slid into reverse after the stock market bubble burst, the dollar has suffered, falling by about 7 per cent against other currencies on the Federal Reserve's broad index since Bush Jr's inauguration in January 2001. But analysts fear that by digging into the public coffers to reflate the economy and pull out of the dotcom downturn, Bush has stored up problems for the future. </p> <p>Both candidates have pledged to halve the huge fiscal deficit during their first term, but Kerry is seen by the markets as more committed to this goal. He has put considerable emphasis on keeping spending under control, and clearing the fiscal mess left by Bush. </p> <p>Judging by his rhetoric during the campaign, Kerry could be more protectionist, perhaps raising the pressure on the Chinese government to float its currency, the renminbi, and allow the dollar to fall against it. Much of the US's vast trade deficit is with Asia, as American consumers suck in billions of dol lars worth of cheap imports from China and Japan. US governments have argued for some time that the Chinese are gaining an unfair advantage by keeping their currency pegged to the dollar at a cheap rate. Last week's surprise move by the Chinese to push up interest rates in an attempt to guide their booming economy towards a soft landing raised hopes in the markets that their next step might be to allow the renminbi to appreciate. </p> <p>That would be a relief for the eurozone, which has so far been the main release valve for downward pressure on the dollar. In recent weeks, eurozone ministers have repeatedly suggested that they are unfazed by the idea of a strong euro, but its appreciation against the dollar is threatening to derail the fragile export-led recovery. </p> <p>The attitude of the Japanese government is also crucial: it has repeatedly propped up the dollar against the yen, and could begin doing so again once the election is out of the way. As a result, G7 meetings have once again become the forum for heated discussion about currencies. 'The G7 meetings have become a lot more important than they were: these are the most important issues facing the global economy,' says Iley. </p> <p>However, analysts fear that even if Japan continues to intervene, its strategy may not be sustainable for long. 'Not even huge intervention can stop the dollar defying gravity in our view,' said currency experts at Bear Stearns in a research note last week. 'The economics of the dollar are still poor.' </p> <p>Abandoning the long-cherished mantra of a 'strong dollar policy' would be read as a dramatic change, even if the policy means little in practice these days. But there is a growing consensus that the US cannot keep spending more than it earns, and importing more than it exports, at such an extraordinary pace. 'It's not in either candidate's best interest to actively encourage a stronger dollar right now,' says Foster. </p> <p>The adjustment may take longer to arrive if George W is in charge, but it can't be avoided for ever.</p>",
  "At a leaving party in London to mark his embarkation on the Eurostar, Peter Mandelson remarked to his guests, among them the Prime Minister's wife, that he had yet to find somewhere to live in Brussels. Given his chequered history of dabbling in the property market - his home loan from Geoffrey Robinson famously cost him his place in the Cabinet - Mr Mandelson joked that he would be looking to rent in the Belgian capital. <p>The imbroglio over the composition of the new commission means that he will now have more time to go house-hunting. Jose Manuel Barroso, the battered incoming President of the Commission, has to produce a new line-up acceptable to both the national governments and the European Parliament which rebelled against his first effort. </p> <p>This will be no sweat for Peter Mandelson. He can be certain that he will have a job in Brussels once all the haggling is over. The same cannot be said of several other nominees. </p> <p>Here is an example of how starkly contrasting things can look from a British perspective and a continental one. When Tony Blair announced that he was sending his frere Pierre to Europe, this was regarded here as the only aspect of the new commission really worthy of note. It was interpreted almost exclusively through the prism of what it meant for British politics. </p> <p>Hugely controversial in Britain, Mr Mandelson has proved to be one of the least contentious candidates for the Commission. He sashayed through the European Parliament's version of 'confirmation hearings' without trouble. They even endured his beginners' French without openly wincing. </p> <p>He is not among those politicians whose careers on the commission may be over before they have begun. Silvio Berlusconi has been forced to swallow his considerable pride and withdraw Rocco Buttiglione whose views on homosexuality, single mothers and working women made him an unacceptable custodian of justice and human rights in the eyes of the European Parliament. At least four other commissioners-designate are also in jeopardy. They have been variously criticised for giving desultory performances when interviewed by MEPs, being entangled with issues of conflicts of interest or demonstrating a feeble grasp of their intended portfolios. </p> <p>To Britain's nominee, no one is raising any objection. Peter Mandelson, in what must be a career first, appears to be a controversy-free zone. He was widely held to have given one of the more impressive and heavyweight performances before the parliament. </p> <p>This is an illustration of what has happened to Tony Blair's European policy. At making Britain count in Europe, the Prime Minister can claim quite a lot of success. At selling Europe to Britain, the Prime Minister's record is one of dashed dreams and broken ambitions. </p> <p>Read the French, German or Italian press and you will find many continental commentators talking about a new British ascendancy in Europe typified by the Prime Minister inserting one of his allies into a key economic job on the commission. Read much of the British press and this same Europe is a dastardly plot against Britain. </p> <p>Under the most euro-enthusiast Prime Minister since Ted Heath three decades ago, Britons tell the pollsters that they are more sceptical about the EU than ever. Thwarted in his original desire to take Britain into the euro, Tony Blair has been compelled to offer a referendum he never wanted on a new constitution about which he has never enthused. </p> <p>He was the last leader to arrive at the lavish signing ceremony in Rome on Friday. And he was the first to leave, scarpering back to Britain rather than join the other leaders for lunch. </p> <p>The Government has adopted an almost entirely negative approach to the constitution, trying to defend it on the basis of the 'red lines' that have not been breached, the 'emergency brakes' that have been applied and the 'opt-outs' that have been retained. Downing Street's strategy has been to try to close down Europe as an issue until the general election is safely out of the way. This is prompting despair among British pro-Europeans who fear that by time Mr Blair starts campaigning for the constitution, the battle will already be lost. </p> <p>Every indicator suggests that Mr Blair has the most massive task ahead of him if he is to get a positive vote for the constitution from Britain. The opinion polls currently suggest that it will be rejected and by a large margin. The No campaign is incredibly well financed and much better organised. It is marking the signing of the constitutional treaty by releasing hostile ads to be shown in cinemas before screenings of Bridget Jones 2: The Edge of Reason. The Foreign Office's response? It will be publishing a pamphlet. </p> <p>What a ghastly outcome it would be for Tony Blair if the Prime Minister who came to office pledging to resolve Britain's ambiguity about Europe presided over the biggest ever crisis in the relationship. This is not a legacy that he could possibly wish for himself. </p> <p>It is partly because the odds against him appear so high that Mr Blair has decided to play this long. Jack Straw articulated one of Whitehall's worst-kept secrets when the Foreign Secretary confirmed that the British referendum will not occur until 2006, making it one of the very last of the plebiscites that will happen in at least nine other countries as well. Only the Danes may vote later than the Brits. That will feed the suspicion that the Government is secretly calculating that it will be spared having to call a referendum because the treaty will have been rejected by too many other countries to make it sensible to put it in front of British voters. </p> <p>Tony Blair has previously insisted that he would press on with a referendum regardless even if the constitution was rejected by other states. The Foreign Secretary seemed happy to leave the impression that there were circumstances in which Britain won't have a referendum after all. </p> <p>One scenario that the Foreign Secretary surely has in mind is a rejection of the constitution by France. The French - what a nice irony - will come to the rescue of Tony Blair. Here is another example of how differently things can look depending on which side of the Channel the protagonists stand. British opponents of the constitution decry it as a charter for more socialist, integrationist meddling by Brussels. The complaint of the most vociferous French opponents is almost the exact opposite. They call it 'une constitution Blairiste', a British victory over their ideal of ever-closer political union. French socialists are calling for a no to the constitution because they view it as entrenching a liberal, freemarket Europe at the expense of a social Europe. </p> <p>This is entangled with the French feeling that their influence is declining in the newly expanded and more Atlanticist Union. English has usurped French as the EU's principal common tongue. France moans that, despite Britain's self-chosen exclusion from the single currency, we are colonising the bureaucracy and amassing more power. Mr Mandelson is again symbolic. While he landed the juicy trade portfolio, one of the most powerful seats in the commission, the French commissioner ended up with the insultingly unglamorous portfolio of transport. </p> <p>Opinion polling suggests that it is already very moot whether France will endorse the constitution. Rejection by the French would give Tony Blair an escape route to spare himself the formidable task of trying to sell the constitution to the British. Alternatively, it could offer him the chance to try to be the undisputed master of Europe. He could seize on a French Non as the most compelling reason for Britain to say Yes.</p>",
  "<p>Isn't there something a touch valedictory about Richard Desmond these days? Four years after he bought the Express Group, he's paying himself \u00a342 million (because, apparently, he's put so much in and taken nothing out) while proclaiming that 'we are as successful as we can possibly be'. </p> <p>Mmm. Daily Express circulation stood at 1,033,858 in November 2000 as Desmond bought it; on the latest ABC figures, that's 960,320. Maybe the Sunday Express, up from 950,802 to 1,003,586, is a happier story (though it was down 50,000 on the month before). </p> <p>But look, says Mr D proudly, waving the Daily Star in triumph at a Guardian interviewer. Circulation 'has reached around double the 2000 figure, bucking every known media trend'. Well, how many bucks make a trend? The Star sold 537,085 in November 2000 and 899,773 on last acquaintance, so 'around double' seems fuzzy maths (as does his boast that the Daily Star Sunday 'now tops 600,000': actual figure, 485,41). </p> <p>Maybe Desmond is just consoling himself for the OFT wait that has left his London evening paper venture in limbo for months, going on years. He's sweating as a report finally nears. </p> <p>That interminable wait may be something of a blessing in disguise, since the target of his disaffection, Associated's Evening Standard, is down almost 8 per cent year on year without Dickie having to spend a penny. Equally, though, the passage of time has let the Mail men put their defences - like a stripped-down free London edition - in place, making any evening war still more wretchedly expensive. </p> <p>So you can't altogether discount that little fin de si\u00e8cle feeling. He's taken his nationals as far as they can go. The battle with the Mail is going nowhere. He didn't get the Telegraph and is stuck with heavy press replacement costs. And most of that big pay cheque - more than \u00a331 million - went on a pension Gordon Brown can only dream of rather than pastures new. </p> <p>Goodbye Dickie? Probably not. He's still putting himself about (though OFT gloom could deepen his own gloom at the double). Still, if you were, say, the brothers Barclay, surveying your new printing partner and that huge replacement bill you share, you might add a little something to your own pension fund, too. </p> <p><strong>Taking them at their word</strong></p> <p>A final word on Campaign 2004 from the Columbia Journalism Review : 'One way the press has failed voters this election has been its refusal to adjudicate between competing claims. </p> <p>'Ever afraid of being accused of bias, journalists are just not comfortable saying overtly that one side is right and the other wrong, even when such a verdict is demonstrable. Because of the unprecedented speed with which information moves in this campaign, the candidates and their operatives seem more willing to say whatever is politically expedient, reasonably assured that their version will get uncritical he said/she said play in the story's brief shelf-life. </p> <p>'And if they're lucky, their version will become part of the conventional wisdom. For example, the Kerry campaign has been saying since February that 3 million jobs have disappeared since Bush took office. But that number represents US private-sector job losses. The net job loss is significantly lower, at 1.1 million. The 3 million figure became locked into the narrative, and by and large it remains un-debunked. </p> <p>'None of this is easy, of course. It takes time and manpower to push beyond he said/she said. And most importantly, it takes the collective will to reclaim an adversarial role. What are we afraid of? Loss of access? Maybe less access wouldn't be a bad thing.' </p> <p>It's a tirade to remember as we warm up for Campaign 2005 and Referendum 2006. He said/she said they all worked for the BBC?</p>",
  "The real puzzle in next Tuesday's presidential election is why George W Bush is not going to get hammered. Tens of millions of ordinary Americans live in more economic insecurity and enjoy less opportunity as a result of the America he is building. Abroad he is leading his country into a dangerous and unwinnable confrontation with Islamic fundamentalism that obstructs the rooting out of terrorism, whose crassness is exposed daily in the flow of news from Iraq. A grass roots revolt should throw him out of office as an incompetent. <p>And yet most polls give him the lead over challenger John Kerry by a narrow margin. The incumbency effect is part of the explanation, as is the skill with which Bush has played the security card. But the deeper truth is that conservative America has become a formidable cultural and electoral force - and it offers its allegiance to George Bush instinctively and unhesitatingly.</p> <p>Even if Kerry manages to win, American conservatism will remain the most dynamic component in American political life. Although a Kerry victory (for which I hope) is conceivable, it is already clear that the race is so tight that the Republicans will retain their grip on the House of Representatives - with little prospect of an early reversal. Talk to Republicans and they regard their control of the House together with more state legislatures as the heart of their power base; in the checked and balanced US political system the presidency is the necessary but insufficient condition for political leadership.</p> <p>In short, a Kerry victory would only be the end of the beginning; for the Democrats to move the US even marginally from its current hardening right-wing trajectory, the long-term task is the rebuilding and sustaining of the liberal coalition that they held from Roosevelt's New Deal to the end of the 1960s - and which will allow them to challenge what is now a Republican legislative dominance. That requires not just political energy and a mobilisation on the ground that the Democrats have only just begun to demonstrate - it also means winning the battle of ideas, where they are still at first base.</p> <p>The scale of the challenge - and the political and intellectual embeddedness of US conservatism - is still not properly grasped. And why, despite his monumental mistakes and gawky malapropisms, Bush is still the narrow favourite to win?</p> <p>I got a clearer idea why in a debate at the Oxford Union on Thursday night; speaking for Bush's re-election was Grover Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform and one of the leaders of the American Conservative revolution. Norquist's rhetoric made little impact on his quintessentially British liberal audience - our pro-Kerry side was to win four to one - but you could see how effective his pitch would be in the US. The Democrats were a coalition of the liberal elite and the two wings of the 'Dependency Movement', he declaimed - those who receive welfare and those who administer it. When somebody got a job and became a Republican (working and being a Republican were coterminous) they quickly saw the case for paying less or no tax. The Republican base was at bottom about industrious, self-starting business people and workers who didn't want government to tell them what to do or spend so much of their money. Bush would continue to deliver to this constituency. Vote for him. </p> <p>We've heard pitches for lower taxes before, but an Oliver Letwin or even John Redwood doesn't do it with the same sting or passion. What gives Norquist its bitter, cutting edge is the depth of his complaint. He's on the side of the ordinary American and the common man against the liberal elite and the do-gooders. They're the wine drinkers, the French speakers, the interferers in American lives, the indulgers of homosexuals, the mockers of faith and the upholders of political correctness.</p> <p>Norquist is on the side of working Americans living in the outer suburbs springing up like topsy around every US city; the network of soulless shopping malls, never-ending cloned streets and newly built churches created by the appetite of US property developers. These instant developments are communities only in name; their rootless inhabitants, questing for meaning in their lives, are the prey upon which the New Republicanism feeds.</p> <p>Its success, as Thomas Frank writes in his compelling book What's the Matter with America? , is that it has used largely cultural symbols - against irreligion, abortion, gun control, stem-cell research - to build a new working-class constituency that believes an allegedly hegemonic liberal elite wants to do down what working America holds dear.</p> <p>They will build national parks on farmland, mandate special holidays for transgendered war veterans, decree only gay couples can adopt children, as part of the same world view that wants to control gun use and get UN resolutions to act in Iraq. Thus the working class becomes the ally of a party that gives tax cuts to the top 1 per cent and is set on undermining the institutions that try to offer working Americans security and opportunity. The irony could not be more complete.</p> <p>Frank sees no end in sight, largely because the secular forces unleashed by American capitalism are so powerful. This is the genius of the conservative position. It is a crusade fuelled by a never-ending tide of complaint that is compelled to set itself unachievable objectives in its battle to reduce women's rights and against the commercial ethic that so beleaguers religion but their non-achievement only proves the malevolent hegemony of the liberal elite and thus the correctness of the right's analysis.</p> <p>THIS HOSTILITY to modernity and sense of beleaguerment spills over to fuel an ugly American nationalism. Foreigners, and especially Muslim foreigners, are part of the threat to the values and lifestyles of ordinary God-fearing Americans. To cast the response to 11September as a war on terror not only offers a route to achieving American security; it enlists, as Bush knows full well, this new American nationalism to the cause and thus the side of militant Republicanism. To understand his campaign - speeches laced with biblical references, solidarity over every right-wing cultural icon, commitment to cut taxes and insistence he is the right commander-in-chief to lead the US in its war on terror - you need to understand the new forces underpinning American conservatism.</p> <p>Kerry and the Democrats confront a Hydra. They have assets - America's knowledge workers, Hispanics and blacks are all massively Democrat; a significant part of America's working class do understand which party represents their interests and are dubious about rabid conservatism.</p> <p>The good news is that this liberal coalition is giving Bush's Republican party such an effective challenge; the bad news is that it is not more effective still. Win or lose on Tuesday, progressive America still has a lot to do - but it would be better to start by winning.</p>",
  "A few weeks ago furious protesters pounded on the windows of the head office of the Minneapolis Star and Tribune, a respectable newspaper in the northern US state of Minnesota, whose journalists aren't used to being the targets of rage and derision. Rob Daves, the paper's pollster, saw the crowd gathering on the front steps as he came out for his lunchtime jog. He didn't realise why they were there and went off on his run. By the time he got back, they were gone, which was just as well because much of the rage and derision was directed at him. <p>'Hey, hey, ho, ho, Rob Daves has got to go!' the Republican pickets chanted. 'Liberals!' they screamed at hacks leaving for a bite to eat. It may not sound much of an insult to you, but in conservative America alleging that journalists are liberals is almost as wounding as alleging that they are communists, which the demonstrators proceeded to do when they switched to the chant of 'Star and Sickle, you're in a pickle'. </p> <p>The Star and Tribune had a run a poll saying that John Kerry had a 9 per cent lead over George W Bush in Minnesota. Rival polls claimed the race was tied. The paper's editor had endorsed Kerry, and the Republicans believed they had uncovered a liberal plot to convince their supporters that there was no point turning out to vote. </p> <p>Over in New York, moveon.org, an alliance of two million Bush loathers who, like the Minnesota Republicans, are unlikely to get through the tension of election night without a nervous collapse, paid for an attack ad in the New York Times. 'Why Does America's Top Pollster Keep Getting it Wrong?' it wanted to know. Gallup's polls, used by CNN and USA Today, had given Bush a 14 point lead but other polls conducted at the same time put it at around 3 per cent. The Kerryites noted that George Gallup Jr, son of the poll's founder and director of its research centre, was a born-again Christian of the nosiest type who had said earlier this year that 'the most profound purpose of polls is to see how people are responding to God'. </p> <p>'We thought the purpose is to faithfully and factually report public opinion,' moveon.org retorted with a sniff. </p> <p>You get the picture. Religious fundamentalists in the polling industry back God and Bush and do nothing to dispel the helpful illusion that the President is invincible. </p> <p>The polling companies dismissed the protests as overheated allegations from an angry campaign. But the demonstrators were on to something. How can one poll give Kerry a nine point lead in Minnesota and others give him no lead at all? Why do CNN viewers hear that Bush is cruising to a landslide victory, while he's in the tightest race imaginable on other channels? Why for that matter has Labour's poll share in the past month bounced between 28 per cent and 39 per cent according to which newspaper your read? Are any of these figures true or false? And if newspapers and broadcasters can't say they're true, why do they pretend that they are facts on a par with the statement 'Yasser Arafat was admitted to hospital last week'? </p> <p>The pollsters can't all be right, but they may all be wrong, and a few American journalists have the guts to admit it. </p> <p>Sceptics in the media have always seen opinion polls as crooked: not as deceitful as horoscopes, but way short of the exacting standards met by the racing tipsters. Where the Minnesota Republicans and the New York liberals get it wrong is to assume the crookedness is the result of political bias. To be sure, pollsters are a part of the process which sets 'the agenda' and determines which political positions are 'appropriate' and which politicians are 'credible', but most are honest by their own lights. It's just that their lights are dimming with each passing year. </p> <p>Last week the Washington Post 's pollster Richard Morin wrote a long, despairing piece whose headline 'Don't Ask Me' said it all. In Britain, the campaign polls may have underestimated Tory support in the last three elections, but the exit polls, which have far more money behind them, were reasonably close in 1997 and 2001. Morin noted that in the US, even the exit polls were a shambles. </p> <p>The reason why pollsters fear their racket is 'on the way to extinction' is that the public is fed up with being pestered by hucksters. If you think about it, talking to a polling company is an odd way to behave. Strangers ask you to give them time and personal information for nothing so that they can profit from it. Once the pollsters had few competitors, now everyone's at it. In the vast United States the only way to sample the electorate is by phone. </p> <p>But the polling companies aren't the only people cold calling at the precise moment when the dinner has boiled over and the baby's nappy exploded. Telemarketers infest the country. To combat them, there are call screening systems and attempts in state legislatures to make cold calling illegal. Those who can't stop the pollsters getting through are fighting back with ingenious technologies. </p> <p>The Washington Post told the sad story of Rick Klaastad, a market researcher for a polling company in Oregon, who dialled an elderly man on his contact list. 'Apparently he has some electronic device attached to the phone and the next thing I hear was this loud, painful sound. It was as about as bad as it gets - imagine turning an FM stereo up full blast with a really good set of speakers. It bruised my eardrum.' </p> <p>Huge numbers refuse to talk to pollsters. Morin found that 'in some surveys fewer than one in five calls produces a completed interview - raising doubts whether such polls accurately reflect the views of the public or merely report the opinions of stay-at-home Americans who are too bored, too infirm or too lonely to hang up.' </p> <p>To put it at its politest, I think it's fair to say that American polls aren't want scientists call random samples. </p> <p>Nor are they in Britain. Whenever the media is forced to ask whether findings that 57.2 per cent of the population don't trust Tony Blair or 12.8 per cent of twentysomething women have given up one-night stands after a three-in-a-bed romp with a two-timing love rat are true, it always quotes pollsters. What journalists neglect to mention is that the polling industry makes its real money from business, not newspapers or television. If CEOs began to suspect that the beguilingly precise findings on the existence of niche markets were false, tens of millions of pounds would be lost. </p> <p>If you leave the self-interested defenders of the industry behind and turn to objective outsiders such as Roger Jowell, who runs the British Social Attitudes Survey, you find that they have been saying for years that opinion polls aren't random samples. </p> <p>He explains the persistent failure to get Tory support right in campaign polls by the fact that a sizeable number of Conservatives think that time is money and don't see why they should give something for nothing. They brush past the market researcher standing in the street with a tight smile. Labour supporters and Liberal Democrats are kinder people who are more likely to help out a stranger. </p> <p>Whether they will continue to do so is doubtful. Commerce is crowding into private space via junk mail, cold calls, texted adverts and the street confrontations arranged by those lovable charities. Cold calling has prejudiced Americans against telephone polling. Chugging and other forms of aggressive begging are likely to prejudice a fair chunk of the British against the poor woman in the shopping centre trying to scratch a living wage from Mori. </p> <p>A lot flows from the decline of polling. First, readers who are close to tears because most US polls give Bush a slight lead can relax until election night. Only two of the 11 final national polls were right in 2000 - and there's no reason to believe that that dismal record will be bettered. (Conversely, Bush supporters - a minority among you, I suspect - shouldn't be too cocksure, defeat or a landslide is as likely as a narrow win.) </p> <p>Second, all the focus-group policies the government uses to please the electorate may not only be wrong in principle but a failure in practice because the public may very well not be pleased in the least. </p> <p>Finally, if the next election is as messy as a few of us suspect, with three-cornered contests taking place across the country and voters deciding whether to vote tactically against Blair or the Tories, the polls will be all important to people who want to work out what the consequences of their vote will be. They should know in advance that there's a fair chance that the polls will be tosh.</p>"
