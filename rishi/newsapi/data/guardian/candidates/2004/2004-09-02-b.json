  "John Kerry's campaign will try today to fight back from the four-day battering of the Republican convention by trying to refocus the election on the faltering US economy. <p>The vitriolic attacks on Mr Kerry in New York make it clear the White House will fight the election almost solely on the question of leadership in the war in Iraq, an issue on which George Bush is clearly preferred by American voters. </p> <p>The Kerry camp - while having to tackle his portrayal by top Republicans as being unfit to serve as commander in chief - is struggling to talk about the economy and jobs, an area in which Mr Kerry has a strong advantage. </p> <p>Democrats plan to take aim at Mr Bush's revival last night of his claim to be a \"compassionate conservative\", his slogan from the 2000 election, after four years of government that have witnessed a 1.3 million rise in the ranks of America's poor and a 1.4 million increase in Americans without health insurance. </p> <p>The last, frenetic phase of the campaign begins now, in the wake of the convention. </p> <p>The Democratic challenge may be helped today with new employment figures that are expected to show signs of a faltering recovery. Jobs are a critical issue in large swing states such as Ohio and Pennsylvania. Half of those polled in a recent CBS survey of all the battleground states said their communities had lost jobs under the Bush administration. </p> <p>In his convention speech last night Mr Bush touted proposals to increase public spending for local vocational colleges and retraining schemes as the solution for dealing with tenacious pockets of unemployment. </p> <p>\"The times in which we live and work are changing dramatically. The workers of our parents' generation typically had one job, one skill, one career - often with one company that provided healthcare and a pension. And most of those workers were men. Today, workers change jobs, even careers, many times during their lives, and in one of the most dramatic shifts our society has seen, two-thirds of all moms also work outside the home,\" the president said, according to excerpts of the speech published before delivery . </p> <p>\"This changed world can be a time of great opportunity for all Americans to earn a better living, support your family, and have a rewarding career. And government must take your side.\" </p> <p>With the exception of Mr Bush himself, who also discussed tax and pension proposals carried forward from his first term, the economy barely registered as a theme at the four-day convention at Madison Square Garden. </p> <p>A textual analysis by the New York Times found that the word \"jobs\" had been used by podium speakers 28 times in the first three days; \"Kerry\" was mentioned 86 times. </p> <p>Dick Cheney and Zell Miller spoke of Mr Kerry more than most. Between them, the vice- president and the defecting Georgia Democratic senator mounted an assault on the challenger of a ferocity not witnessed at a party convention for more than a decade. </p> <p>Both made a virtue of the Bush administration's unilateralism, and lampooned the Democrat for pledging to consult the world community. </p> <p>Mr Cheney's attack focused on Mr Kerry's senate record and accused him of inconsistency on critical issues of war and peace and for his opposition to an $87bn government spending request last year to fund the Iraqi occupation. </p> <p>\"Senator Kerry is campaigning for the position of commander in chief. Yet he does not seem to understand the first obligation of a commander in chief, and that is to support American troops in combat,\" the vice-president said. </p> <p>\"He talks about leading a more sensitive war on terror, as though al-Qaida will be impressed with our softer side.\" </p> <p>Mr Cheney's wry, downbeat delivery drew only occasional cheers from the 4,000-strong crowd. It was Mr Miller, still nominally a Democrat, who galvanised the hall. </p> <p>\"Senator Kerry has made it clear that he would use military force only if approved by the United Nations. Kerry would let Paris decide when America needs defending,\" he said. </p> <p>He went on to list weapons programmes that Mr Kerry had voted against soon after the end of the cold war. He said: \"This is the man who wants to be the commander in chief of our US armed forces. US forces armed with what? Spitballs?\" </p> <p>The speech, delivered in a southern accent, trembling with indignation, was the biggest hit of the convention. </p> <p>\"Now, while young Americans are dying in the sands of Iraq and the mountains of Afghanistan, our nation is being torn apart and made weaker because of the Democrats' manic obsession to bring down our commander in chief,\" he said. </p> <p>Some analysts predicted such ferocity could backfire. But Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster who conducted a focus group of undecided voters in Ohio on Wednesday night, said: \"Our swing voters, evenly split between Bush and Gore 2000 voters, were surprised and impressed a Democrat senator would appear at a Republican convention and challenge directly his party's nominee.\"</p>",
  "The belligerence of the Republican convention's keynote speaker was so overpowering it easily obscured the monochromatic performance of Dick Cheney. Senator Zell Miller of Georgia did not vary his grim expression or his shouting like a backwoods preacher casting out the devil. But his raw rhetoric framed the most profound questions about patriotism and democracy in wartime. <p>The previous speakers, from Rudy Giuliani to Arnold Schwarzenegger, had been chosen for their lack of partisan regularity in order to better carry attack lines against John Kerry. Superficially, Miller was to be the crescendo of this tactical march to the podium, a Democrat regretting his party's fall from grace and singing the praises of the Republican president. </p> <p>Miller had been a keynote speaker at the Democratic convention of 1992 that nominated Bill Clinton. His politics then were a vibrant southern populism against the special interests. In the Republican sweep two years later, however, Miller experienced a near-death experience, almost losing as governor because he suggested removing the Confederate battle-flag from its corner of the state flag where it had been placed during the white resistance to civil rights laws. Afterwards, Miller tacked steadily rightward. </p> <p>Upon leaving the governorship, he jettisoned his Democratic alliances and became a lobbyist for the Phillip Morris tobacco combine. Elected as a US senator, Miller played as though he had been betrayed, aligning himself with the Republicans. In this he was following the tragic trajectory of southern populists past, who had transformed themselves into their opposites. </p> <p>\"Today,\" Miller said, \"at the same time young Americans are dying in the sands of Iraq and the mountains of Afghanistan, our nation is being torn apart and made weaker because of the Democrats' manic obsession to bring down our commander in chief.\" In one sentence, he advanced a new stab-in-the-back theory, achieved the seamless merger of Iraq and Afghanistan, attributed political division to the Democrats (who had supported the war in Afghanistan and overwhelmingly backed the congressional war resolution on Iraq), and stripped the presidency down to its military function. </p> <p>Next, he offered a peculiar history of the constitution and the bill of rights. \"It has been said so truthfully,\" said Miller, \"that it is the soldier, not the reporter, who has given us the freedom of the press. It is the soldier, not the poet, who has given us freedom of speech. It is the soldier, not the agitator, who has given us the freedom to protest.\" </p> <p>Kerry, by contrast, was plotting a betrayal to the United Nations and, even worse, \"Kerry would let Paris decide when America needs defending\". </p> <p>After Miller, Cheney seemed anticlimactic in his rote smear of Kerry's masculinity for using the word \"sensitive\". Cheney's lack of emotional effect and energy lends him a strange gravity, but he remains an unpopular politician whose natural habitat is not the public stage. His effectiveness rests behind the curtain. </p> <p>Miller's oration, extraordinary in its hostility was hardly pitched to win over undecided voters, mostly women. It reflected more than a Republican base strategy calculated for maximum partisan motivation. Miller's skewed history of the United States was intended to taint political debate itself as subversive. But it was Theodore Roosevelt who said: \"To announce that...we are to stand by the president, right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and servile, but is morally treasonable to the American public.\" </p> <p>The burden of Bush's polarising convention now strains his ability to revive his former theme as \"a uniter, not a divider\". But as Miller's and Cheney's speeches make plain, one of the tests of strength of the \"war president\" is not to look back, for that would be weak. </p> <p><b> </b> Sidney Blumenthal is a former senior adviser to Bill Clinton, and Washington bureau chief of salon.com. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:sidney_blumenthal@yahoo.com\">sidney_blumenthal@yahoo.com</a></p>",
  "Dangerous confusion threatened the Republicans on the second day of their convention. In an interview on the NBC Today Show, President Bush was deferentially asked about the war on terrorism. \"I don't think you can win it,\" he replied. For hours afterwards, his campaign issued bulletins to say he hadn't meant it. <p>Finally, appearing before the American Legion veterans in Nashville, Bush declared: \"We will win.\" </p> <p>Vice-President Dick Cheney helpfully explained: \"The president certainly never intended to convey the notion that we can't win.\" </p> <p>By breaking his own iron law - \"I don't do nuance\" - Bush had blurred himself into the negative image of John Kerry as a flip-flopper. </p> <p>Nuance leads to ambivalence, which can lead to inaction; and who then can be an action hero? </p> <p>Bush's mistaken nuance set the stage for the larger-than-life persona of Conan the Barbarian, Predator, The Terminator, Commando, and, not least, Kindergarten Cop. \"This is like winning an Oscar, as if I would know,\" said Arnold Schwarzenegger, governor of California. </p> <p>Schwarzenegger is the only political figure in America who is married to the Kennedys and is an old Bush family retainer. His ability to operate in several dimensions at once is intrinsic to his rise. In 1988 he campaigned for the elder Bush. \"They call me The Terminator, but, when it comes to America's future, Michael Dukakis is the real Terminator,\" he said. </p> <p>For that he was made the president's fitness adviser and appeared at the White House to direct Colin Powell (then General Powell) in push-ups on the South Lawn. </p> <p>Schwarzenegger's policies as governor- pro-gay, pro-choice, pro-environmental - have little in common with Bush's, and he has no chance of carrying his state for Bush. As a principal speaker on \"People of Compassion\" night, his role as supporting actor was to transfer his image to Bush and the party. </p> <p>Arnold has an aesthetic sense that passes over the heads of the Republicans. No matter how scripted he may be, he remains pure in his underlying message. He makes the case for the narcissism of power through the power of narcissism. </p> <p>No one is more narcissistic than the body builder. He builds his reputation standing before mirrors. </p> <p>Schwarzenegger offered the Republican convention totemic worship of virility borne out of fear of its fading. It was an act he has been perfecting for decades. In its essence, he offered a sexual identity panic speech. </p> <p>He told of being a \"once scrawny\" boy in Austria daydreaming about becoming an American, inspired by John Wayne movies. In 1968 he arrived, during a presidential campaign. \"Listening to Nixon speak ... I said to my friend, 'What party is he?' 'He's a Republican.' I said: 'Then I'm a Republican.'\" </p> <p>He offered the flattery of the immigrant to the native: \"Everything I have, my career, my success, my family, I owe to America.\" </p> <p>Having established his citizenship, Schwarzenegger felt entitled to articulate the Republican credo - power over weakness. \"If you believe this country, not the UN, is the best hope for democracy, then you are a Republican.\" Thus the immigrant blasted internationalism. </p> <p>\"If you believe that we must be fierce and relentless and terminate terrorism, then you are a Republican.\" Thus the Democrats were soft. </p> <p>\"And to those critics who are so pessimistic about our economy, I say: Don't be economic girlie-men.\" \"Girlie-man\" is a peculiar accusation. It reveals fear of women and their complex values. The name-calling is a frantic effort to suppress nuance, which the action hero fears he may harbour within. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Sidney Blumenthal is a former senior adviser to Bill Clinton, and the Washington bureau chief of <a href=\"http://www.salon.com\">salon.com</a>. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:sidney_blumenthal@yahoo.com\">sidney_blumenthal@yahoo.com</a></p>",
  "For the second time in a week, Vladimir Putin was forced to interrupt his Black Sea holiday yesterday and rush back to Moscow to deal with a horrifying terrorist outrage linked to the crisis in Chechnya. <p>Like last week's bombing of two Russian passenger airliners, the school hostage siege in North Ossetia caught the Russian president on the hop. It follows closely on the heels of Tuesday's suicide bombing in Moscow and a string of other incidents in Chechnya and Ingushetia. </p> <p>This dramatic surge in Chechen separatist violence threatens to draw Mr Putin into what could become, in effect, a third Chechen war - with the alarming possibility of a wider Caucasus conflagration. </p> <p>His predecessor, Boris Yeltsin, miserably failed to suppress Chechen nationalism through military intervention from 1994-96. Three years later, Mr Putin, then prime minister, plunged into a second conflict which he used to boost his presidential credentials. </p> <p>Mr Putin declared victory in early 2000 and again in mid-2002 - but like President George Bush, who prematurely announced \"mission accomplished\" in Iraq, Mr Putin has been repeatedly made to look weak and foolish by the Chechen rebels. </p> <p>That is a dangerous way to treat the former KGB hard man and judo fan. Even at the best of times, Mr Putin's tolerance for opposition or dissent is limited. If provoked, he hits back. Yet now, despite his hurried return to base, it is unclear what he can do beyond resolving the immediate crisis in North Ossetia. Mr Putin refuses to countenance negotiations in Chechnya; the use of force has demonstrably failed; and his political machinations, including last weekend's bogus presidential election to replace an assassinated pro-Moscow placeman, are counterproductive. </p> <p>In July, in apparent exasperation, Mr Putin sacked three of Russia's most senior generals, including Anatoly Kvashnin, chief of the general staff, over the setbacks in Chechnya. But this has simply led to the Kremlin being more intimately associated with continuing humiliations in the region. </p> <p>Considered more broadly, the overall authority of a man whose approach to governance is increasingly authoritarian is under challenge on a range of fronts and not just in the Caucasus. </p> <p>Mr Putin won a second term by a landslide last March, largely by denying media access to rival candidates. His message was that he alone could provide Russians with security and stability after the chaos of the post-Soviet Yeltsin era. Above all, Mr Putin presents himself as a safe pair of hands. </p> <p>But there have been several fumbles of late. Terrorism apart, Mr Putin has faced unusually vehement public protests since March over cuts in longstanding social benefits, including housing subsidies, free public transport and prescriptions. </p> <p>His stated aim of doubling Russia's GDP has begun to look as far-fetched as his claim to have whipped the Chechens. Amid open cabinet bickering, his finance minister, Aleksei Kudrin, complained recently that economic reforms have been \"screwed up\". And then there is the Kremlin's long-running, destabilising vendetta with Yukos Oil. </p> <p>While Mr Putin's strongman image may be wearing thin at home, foreign criticism is also on the increase. </p> <p>In an open letter to President Jacques Chirac of France and the German chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, last month ahead of their talks with Mr Putin, Human Rights Watch deplored abuses of press and academic freedoms in Russia and attacks on non-governmental organisations. </p> <p>It also urged France and Germany to act over Mr Putin's \"failure to establish a meaningful accountability process for crimes committed by Russian soldiers and police forces [in Chechnya]... enforced disappearances, summary executions, and torture have grossly undermined trust in Russian state institutions among ordinary Chechens.\" This caused people such as last week's \"black widow\" plane bombers to resort to violence, it suggested. </p> <p>According to Amnesty International, \"Russian security forces continue to enjoy almost total impunity for serious violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in Chechnya\". Continuing excesses by Chechen fighters, like the Ossetia siege, were also strongly condemned. </p> <p>In truth, it sometimes seems that the only people not criticising Mr Putin these days are western governments. Mr Chirac and Mr Schr\u00f6der endorsed Sunday's sham election and sidestepped human rights issues. The Foreign Office, like the US state department, sticks to cautious formulas expressing \"concern\" and fond hopes for better, more democratic days. </p> <p>This attitude has many explanations. Among them is the fact that the US wants Russian support for its own \"war on terror\", so a blind eye is turned in Chechnya. Another reason is the US-British requirement for Moscow's acquiescence over Iraq (and Palestine). And then there is oil. </p> <p>Russia is an energy giant whose importance as a global supplier is increasing rapidly. It is the world's largest exporter of natural gas and second largest exporter of oil after Saudi Arabia. Put crudely, the west needs Russia. And it believes Mr Putin can deliver. End of story.</p>",
  "Welcome to the most important American election in living memory. A world election, in which the world has no vote. Four more years of Bush can confirm millions of Muslims in a self-defeating phobia against the west, Europe in hostility to America, and the US on the path to fiscal ruin. Four more years, and the Beijing Olympics will see ascending China dictating its terms to a divided world. <p>Don't be fooled by those who say that one lot is as bad as the other, or even, like the New Statesman's John Pilger, that Bush's re-election may be the lesser evil, because \"supremacy is the essence of Americanism; only the veil changes or slips\". Don't be put off by John Kerry's attempts to out-Bush Bush, as he attacks rather than applauds the president for inadvertently admitting that this \"war on terror\" cannot be \"won\" in the way that the second world war was won. Beyond the electoral posturing, Kerry knows that is true. As president, he would act accordingly, and the change would make a vast difference to every one of us. </p> <p>The American election will have far more consequences for Europe than the last European elections. It's probably more important to Britain than the next British election. Yet there seems so little we can do to affect the outcome. We feel like a punter whose life savings have been invested in a bet on a single boxer in a single bout. All we can do is cheer our lungs out from the ringside. Except that if we shout too loudly for Kerry we may actually help the other man - especially if we shout in French. </p> <p>George Bush's chances of winning depend on convincing a sufficient number of American swing voters of the truth of his narrative about \"America at war\". While his close supporters fund accusations that John Kerry marginally falsified his own war story in Vietnam, the president's whole campaign is premised on selling a false war story. </p> <p>\"Like the second world war,\" he declared in mid-August, \"the war we are fighting now began with a ruthless, surprise attack on America.\" Well, tell that to the Poles. (I'm writing this on the 65th anniversary of the true beginning of the second world war, which was indeed a ruthless, surprise attack - on Poland.) Or the British. Or the French. But for President Bush, the second world war began only with the Japanese attack on America at Pearl Harbor. </p> <p>The contemporary analysis is as bad as the history. Again and again, the war on terror - Wot, in Washington shorthand - is compared to the second world war or the cold war. There's only one way to win the war on terror, his key political adviser Karl Rove told an audience of young Republicans in the run-up to the convention. And that is \"to chase the enemy to the ends of the earth and utterly destroy him\". Like the cowboy hero of a hundred westerns. At the convention, they rally support with a film of US army tanks advancing down a road and warships cutting through the seas. Bush's own re-election website (<a href=\"http://www.georgewbush.com/\">www.georgewbush.com</a>) has a homepage link entitled \"Winning the war on terror\". Of course, Republican leaders can make more sophisticated arguments in private conversation, but this whole campaign depends on projecting a grand narrative in which the US is engaged in a conventional war, which it will win mainly by martial valour and force of arms. </p> <p>But it isn't, and it won't. \"Utterly destroy him,\" cries Karl Rove. But who is he? Osama bin Laden? A Palestinian suicide bomber? An Iranian mullah? The unknown terrorist? The whole point of this new kind of struggle is that there is no single clearly identifiable leader or regime, no Hitler or Soviet Union, who can be thus destroyed. (Obviously, capturing Osama bin Laden, if he's still alive, would certainly help.) And if we accept, as we should, that we face a serious array of new threats, among which Islamist terrorism plays an important part, what is the role of military force in reducing the threat? Much less than in earlier wars. If military force was 80% responsible for the west's victory in the second world war, and perhaps - through the impact on the Soviet Union of the arms race - 30% responsible for the west's victory in the cold war (and even that figure may be too high), it will only be 10% - or perhaps 15% - responsible for winning this one. </p> <p>The victory will depend on courage, resolution, and a determination to defend what we value - American leaders are right to remind us of this. It will depend on skilled intelligence and police work. But it will depend, above all, on addressing the political and economic causes of terrorism, to dry the swamps in which al-Qaida mosquitoes breed, and preserving and unfolding the magnetic attractions of our own free societies. It's here that Bush has been such a disaster. He has presided over the largest build-up of the American military since the end of the cold war, and the swiftest, most comprehensive dismantling of the country's popularity in the world since Vietnam. In the weapons categories that really count, no one has done more to disarm America than George Bush. </p> <p>A surprising number of Americans see this. In a recent Pew poll, 67% of those asked said that the US had become less respected in the world, and 43% thought this was a major problem. It's not just wishful thinking that makes Democrats constantly harp on the argument that Bush has ruined America's standing with its traditional allies and friends. They know it means votes. </p> <p>So perhaps we are not such impotent bystanders at the ringside, after all. Yes, we don't have a vote. Yes, if we shout too loudly for Kerry it may help his opponent. But most Olympic contenders testify to the importance of the crowd. And this election, unusually for an American election, is as much about events and reactions outside America's borders as about anything at home, including even \"the economy, stupid\". In that same Pew poll, 41% of those asked say the most important problem facing the nation is \"war/foreign policy/terrorism\" against just 26% for economic issues. </p> <p>It would obviously be disastrous if only those European countries that opposed the Iraq war now explicitly support Kerry. That would give credibility to the conservative senator Mitch McConnell's acid jibe that \"Kerry wants to outsource our foreign policy to Paris and Berlin.\" It would be even worse if those countries that supported the Iraq war, especially Britain, Poland and Italy, did anything to suggest that Bush could carry on as he has since 2001 and still enjoy their support. No European government would be wise to endorse either candidate. They can leave that to us unofficial Europeans. But European leaders can spell out clearly the terms on which Europe stands ready to be a full partner of the US in reducing the threat of terrorism that concerns Europe at least as much as it does America. From the ringside of the world election, we should shout not for Europe, not for Bush, not even for Kerry, but for America to win. They'll know which America we mean. </p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b> Timothy Garton Ash's new book, Free World: Why a Crisis of the West Reveals the Opportunity of Our Time, was recently published by Penguin </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.freeworldweb.net\">www.freeworldweb.net</a></p>",
  "President George Bush will tonight present himself as the \"candidate for change\" in this year's presidential election, presenting a second-term agenda that will emphasise reform at home and an uncompromising stance abroad. <p>He will address the Republican party convention from the centre of New York's Madison Square Garden, on a small circular podium linked to the main stage by a catwalk. From there, he will make his bid to convince the US electorate to bestow on him something it denied his father: another four years in office. </p> <p>The theme of the domestic elements of the speech will be the march towards an \"ownership society\" as a solution to unemployment, the sluggish economy and a looming pensions crisis. </p> <p>Mr Bush has edged ahead of his Democratic party challenger, John Kerry, in opinion polls in the past week. But his aides are aware that the president's approval ratings are hovering around the 50% mark - hardly a guarantee of re-election. </p> <p>Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster, said the slight shift in the numbers was principally a result of the campaign by anti-Kerry Vietnam veterans to question the Democratic contender's war record. </p> <p>\"[The polls] represent a serious shift in Kerry's credibility, not necessarily a permanent shift in presidential support. It's more of a Kerry weakness than a Bush strength,\" Mr Luntz said. \"But that's what the convention does. It's to convert a Kerry weakness into a Bush strength.\" </p> <p>Mr Bush's address tonight, formally accepting the party nomination, is designed to stress his attributes as a wartime leader. But it will also lay out a broad outline of his domestic plan to create jobs and control the deficit. </p> <p>Republican officials say the speech will showcase Mr Bush as a \"transformational president\", an \"agent of change\" whose reform programme has only been half implemented. </p> <p>It is a hard task for an incumbent with four years in office under his belt to sell himself as a new broom. That is particularly true when the first term in office has seen another 1.3 million Americans living below the poverty line, and another 1.4 million without medical insurance. </p> <p>Mr Bush is the first president since Herbert Hoover, more than 70 years ago, to oversee a net loss in jobs. A government spending surplus inherited from the Clinton administration has plummeted to projected deficits of more than $400bn (\u00a3223bn). </p> <p>The trick of tonight's speech will be to distance the president from economic problems, blaming them inherited handicaps, the war on terror and resistance to his programme. As one one Republican strategist put it: \"Just because you think the country is headed on the wrong track doesn't necessarily mean you disagree with Bush.\" </p> <p>Mr Bush will argue that the tax cuts during his term in office have begun to turn the economy around and need to be permanent to encourage investment and growth. He will also revive a proposal to eliminate inheritance tax. </p> <p>He will relaunch a plan to deal with the danger of a social security crisis as millions more baby boomers retire, by semi-privatising the system, allowing workers to invest in individual pensions accounts over which they would have control, rather than paying into a general state fund. </p> <p>The critical problems affecting US healthcare will be blamed largely on the costs imposed on doctors and hospitals by malpractice lawsuits. The Bush solution will be to sharply limit the ability of trial lawyers to extract large damages payments. At the same time, tax credits will be used to help the working poor to buy private health insurance. </p> <p>High energy costs will be offset by a renewed push to open up wilderness areas in the US to exploration, in the hope of increasing domestic supply. </p> <p>All the elements of the programme have two traits in common. They will not require large scale government spending in the short term and therefore not increase the deficit, and they all emerged in the course of the first term.</p>",
  "The banana-yellow baseball caps, the Republican Convention's signature fashion statement, single \"W\" sewn at the front, worn with suit and tie, or glittery top, were a dead giveaway. This is not the kind of baseball cap pulled on backwards at the ballpark or at greasy spoon truckstops where Yew-Ess-Ay rules, and Real Men take pulls straight from the necks of their Buds before wiping the foam with the backs of their hairy wrists. No sirree, this cute banana item verges on the metro- sexual. The Texas delegation, Dubya's home state cheerleaders, all sport the expected cowboy uniforms but the 10-gallon hats of white straw are polished and glossy; the blue denim shirts as softly brushed and the chinos as high-fashioned as anything you'd find in a Dallas boutique. For this, My Friends (as the platform speakers like to call us,) is a smoother, silkier, creamier, richer Republican convention, the mailed fist of war so deeply clad in the velvet glove of patriotic bonding that you'd never feel the knuckles (not unless you read the hard right party platform, with its visceral hostility to embryonic stem cell research, gay marriage, and illegal immigrant amnesties, that is). <p>The interminable and improbable warm-up music on the first night was retro-soul (I Heard It on the Grapevine - an allusion doubtless to the ignoble rot that is currently befouling John Kerry's war record). It was followed by Broadway's greatest hits carefully selected so that the Heartland met rather than collided with Manhattan, Guys and Dolls (I gotta horse right here, Name of Paul Revere suddenly sounding like the national anthem) meets Oklahoma - People will Say We're in Love (cue Laura) - all just dandy for a night on which the distressingly Bush-whipped Senator John McCain, went misty-eyed and uttered the word \"love\" not once, but many times, in his own implausible appeal, complete with quotes from FDR, for a cross-party patriotic cuddle. It was one thing to see McCain's hitherto richly deserved reputation for independent thinking and speaking implode in a vapour cloud of incoherent rhetorical glop; but positively painful to see a hero - yes, a real one - become the instant pariah of both parties for rejecting the overtures of one while giving tepid endorsement to a president he so obviously despises. The stress of doing this seems to have resulted in McCain growing cheeks like a squirrel, doubtless the better to store an autumn's worth of political nuts that he evidently finds too hard, right now, to swallow. </p> <p>By the time a choir, encased in glitter-sprinkled black tops, ascended on the hydraulic stage riser, singing Anchors Aweigh, Into the Wide Blue Yonder and that old Marine favourite From the Halls of Montezuma ... to the Shores of Tripoli (just before a speaker insisted we are not an imperialist nation); the Republicans were on their feet, revival-meeting style, singing, swaying, and ecstatically waggling their Salute to the Troops signs as though war were itself just another upbeat song and dance number, while the GI mortality bill climbs inexorably. </p> <p>After the poodles - showbiz, schmaltz, and schmoozing - the Rottweiler was unleashed, in the shape of ex-mayor Rudy. Flexing his machismo, yielding nothing to Governor Terminator (who after all, once starred in a film in which he got pregnant and came over all mumsy), Giuliani hogged the podium for well over his allotted span, hugely enjoying his own jokes and raising the laff-o-meter with ooh-wicked digs at the inconsistent Kerry, on the same day, alas, that President Bush, who on April 13 had insisted there was no doubt we could win the war on terror, had declared to a national audience on breakfast television that, actually no, he didn't think we could. </p> <p>But Giuliani's job, other than exuberantly promoting himself for the national ticket in four years' time, was to skateboard swiftly past the glaring contradictions of Republican policies, in particular the shrink-your-government party which unaccountably has expanded it beyond any other postwar administration. Nor was he going to give any airtime to the unprecedented cartload of horrors currently burdening the beleaguered republic at home, never mind in Iraq: the brontosaurus-size deficit with its burden on future generations; the jobless faux-recovery; the coming meltdown of entitlements (social security, medicare); the relentless destruction of what is left of America's natural resources; the inexcusable failure to support funding for security inspection at container ports; the stripping of the No Child Left Behind programme the \"education president\" bragged about. Doing that among the Madison Square Garden crowd where ritzy ladies sported rhinestone and diamante \"W\" pins would be like forcing the country club to go slumming on a nice summer's day. No, Rudy's job was there to be Mr 9/11, and to milk, shamelessly, every last ounce of grief over it so that the tears (and believe me, we New Yorkers still have plenty to shed) may be converted into solid political gold for Dubya. </p> <p>The cumulative effect of all this merciless drilling for the motherlode of patriotic emotion was to obliterate yet again, in the public mind, the nonsequitur between 9/11 and Iraq. In the campaign speeches Bush's military actions in Afghanistan, which did have everything to do with 9/11, is always elided in the next sentence with the Iraq war which didn't, as if they were one and the same. It is evidently critical for the success of the Bush campaign that the public not give any thought whatsoever to the difference; so that any sort of military action is seen to be a sign of strength, even when it has made America and the world demonstrably less, not more safe. </p> <p>In the hope that the notoriously geographically-challenged American public can't cope with more than one Middle East map reference at a time, the message is always that Bush's pre-emption was somehow taking the fight to the terrorists rather than creating the ideal conditions for them to flourish. From a chilling piece of reporting in the New York Times by Jon Burns we know that Falujah and much of western Iraq are now no-go areas for both American and Iraqi government troops and have become, in effect The Next Afghanistan; the prime spawning ground of fundamentalist terrorism. But when the point is made that this war (unlike Afghanistan) has almost certainly generated more terror than it has pre-empted, the subject is always changed to the incontestable boons delivered to Iraq by the end of the Saddamite dictatorship. In the banana-coloured baseball cap mindset, liberty is the panacea for all ills, and the notion that it might actually create room for militant religious fundamentalism to assume power in much of Iraq - much the likeliest outcome of next year's elections, short of outright civil war - is literally unthinkable. </p> <p>Still more illogically, the vigour of the Bush response to imminent threats is supposedly represented by the pursuit of the quixotic missile defence system, a vast boon-doggle that has never come close to demonstrating any capacity to fulfill its billing, never mind being precisely the wrong kind of defence against, say, a nuclear device stashed in a Samsonite suitcase. </p> <p>But then the strategy for winning this election devised by Bush's political mastermind Karl Rove, is all about doping the electorate, with alternating doses of smears and sentimentality; fears and feelgood, and above all avoid the stress of serious pauses for thought. (Perhaps the most poignantly utopian T-shirt worn at Sunday's amiable mass anti-Bush demonstration read \"Think. It's patriotic\". At this particular game of calculated thought-avoidance, the Bushes are past masters, as an elaborately orchestrated entrance into Madison Square Garden by Bush 41, Barb by his side, demonstrated. It is perhaps an index of America's short attention span that Old Bush is now seen, in comparison with Young Bush, as a genial old gent, endearing in his third-age urges to parachute from planes or drive high-speed boats across Kennebunkport Bay, though to red meat conservatives 41 remains an irksome relic of moderate republicanism who threw away his re-election by repealing tax cuts when the country was threatened by an avalanche of federal deficits and from a quaint attachment to fiscal responsibility. That was the Republican party then. Now it is Dick Cheney on record as opining that \"deficits don't matter\". Even worse, 41 was - and could this be because he had actually seen combat? - the commander-in-chief who, under the influence of the lily-livered Colin Powell, flinched before the march to Baghdad. </p> <p>This is not quite the whole story, neither then nor now. In his recent throwaway endorsement of the Swift Boat Veteran libels slung at Kerry (\"gee those guys can't all be liars\") - in lazy contradiction to what both US Navy documentation and the witness of those actually on Kerry's boat say - old Bush 41 went right back to the slasher politics of the summer of 1988 directed by his campaign manager, Lee Atwater, at Michael Dukakis, the last Massachusetts Democrat to run for president. Fatally stricken with cancer, Atwater made an extraordinary profession of remorse, but the pre-atonement sleaze-meister Atwater is the one who lives on in the war-rooms of Republican tactics. It was he who made sure that any sustained debate of issues would disappear beneath a barrage of advertising portraying Dukakis as soft on crime for paroling Willie Horton, a murderer who subsequently went recidivist. The hapless Dukakis was forced to defend himself against being thought the liberator of psychotic rapists and murderers. </p> <p>The pink and portly Rove is Atwater with a what-me, artless smile; the connoisseur of damaging innuendo who advises the candidate to distance himself from responsibility for the slurs while making damned sure they don't stop. And in his campaign to present the incumbent as a fundamentally decent, poke-you-in-the-ribs family guy, a down-home President Jekyll, he has the advantage over Atwater in that Bush is indeed many of those things. What he is not, is a serious leader for a serious time. </p> <p>Hey, professor, gimme a break, whadya think, conventions are all about policy or something? One of the opening songs in a routine which increasingly resembled a half-time show at the Superbowl, and which followed the roll call of states nominating the presidential candidate, said it all : \"There's no business like show business ... so let's get on with the show.\" Lights! Music! Schwarzenegger!</p>",
  "Before Karl Rove, Lee Atwater or even James Baker, the Bush family's political guru was a gregarious newspaper owner and campaign consultant from Midland, Texas, named Jimmy Allison. In the spring of 1972, George HW Bush phoned his friend and asked a favour: Could Allison find a place on the Senate campaign he was managing in Alabama for his troublesome eldest son, the 25-year-old George W Bush? <p>\"The impression I had was that Georgie was raising a lot of hell in Houston, getting in trouble and embarrassing the family, and they just really wanted to get him out of Houston and under Jimmy's wing,\" Allison's widow, Linda, told me. \"And Jimmy said, 'Sure.' He was so loyal.\" </p> <p>Linda Allison's story, never before published, contradicts the Bush campaign's assertion that George W Bush transferred from the Texas Air National Guard to the Alabama National Guard in 1972 because he received an irresistible offer to gain high-level experience on the campaign of Bush family friend Winton \"Red\" Blount. In fact, according to what Allison says her late husband told her, the younger Bush had become a political liability for his father, who was then the United States ambassador to the United Nations, and the family wanted him out of Texas. \"I think they wanted someone they trusted to keep an eye on him,\" Linda Allison said. </p> <p>After more than three decades of silence, Allison spoke with Salon over several days before and during the Republican National Convention this week - motivated, as she acknowledged, by a complex mixture of emotions. They include pride in her late husband's accomplishments, a desire to see him remembered, and concern about the apparent double standard in Bush surrogates attacking John Kerry's Vietnam War record while ignoring the president's irresponsible conduct during the war. She also admits to bewilderment and hurt over the rupture her husband experienced in his friendship with George and Barbara Bush. To this day, Allison is unsure what caused the break, though she suspects it had something to do with her husband's opposition to the elder Bush becoming chairman of the Republican National Committee under President Nixon. </p> <p>\"Something happened that I don't know about. But I do know that Jimmy didn't expect it, and it broke his heart,\" she said, describing a ruthless side to the genial Bush clan of which few outsiders are aware. </p> <p>Personal history aside, Allison's recollections of the young George Bush in Alabama in 1972 are relevant as a contrast to the medals for valour and bravery that Kerry won in Vietnam in the same era. An apparent front group for the Bush campaign, Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, has attacked Kerry in television ads as a liar and traitor to veterans for later opposing a war that cost 58,000 American lives. Bush, who has resisted calls from former Vietnam War POW John McCain, R-Ariz, to repudiate the Swift Boat ads, has said he served honourably in the National Guard. </p> <p>Allison's account corroborates a Washington Post investigation in February that found no credible witnesses to the service in the Alabama National Guard that Bush maintains he performed, despite a lack of documentary evidence. Asked if she'd ever seen Bush in a uniform, Allison said: \"Good lord, no. I had no idea that the National Guard was involved in his life in any way.\" Allison also confirmed previously published accounts that Bush often showed up in the Blount campaign offices around noon, boasting about how much alcohol he had consumed the night before. (Bush has admitted that he was a heavy drinker in those years, but he has refused to say whether he also used drugs). </p> <p>\"After about a month I asked Jimmy what was Georgie's job, because I couldn't figure it out. I never saw him do anything. He told me it basically consisted of him contacting people who were impressed by his name and asking for contributions and support,\" Allison said. </p> <p>C Murphy Archibald, a nephew of Red Blount by marriage and a Vietnam veteran who volunteered on the campaign from September 1972 until election night, corroborated Allison's recollections, though he doesn't recall that the Bush name carried much cachet in Alabama at the time. \"I say that because the scuttlebutt on the campaign was that Allison was very sharp and might actually be able to pull off this difficult race\" against the incumbent Democrat, Sen John Sparkman, Archibald said. \"But then no one understood why he brought this young guy from Texas along. It was like, 'Who was this guy who comes in late and leaves early? And why would Jimmy Allison, who was so impressive, bring him on?'\" </p> <p>Bush, who had a paid slot as Allison's deputy in a campaign staffed largely by volunteers, sat in a little office next to Allison's, said Archibald, a workers compensation lawyer in Charlotte, NC. Indeed, when Bush was actually there, he did make phone calls to county chairmen. But he neglected his other duty: the mundane but important task of mailing out campaign materials to the county campaign chairs. Archibald took up the slack, at Allison's request. \"Jimmy didn't say anything about George. He just said, 'These materials are not getting out. It's causing the candidate problems. Will you take it over?'\" </p> <p>While Kerry earned a Silver Star and a Bronze Star after saving a crewmate's life under fire on the Mekong River in Vietnam, by contrast, the Georgie that Allison knew was a young man whose parents did not allow him to live with the consequences of his own mistakes. His powerful father - whom the son seemed to both idolise and resent - was a lifeline for Bush out of predicaments. After Bush graduated from Yale in 1968, his slot in the Texas Air National Guard allowed him to avoid active duty service in Vietnam. The former speaker of the Texas state House, Democrat Ben Barnes, now admits he pulled strings to get Bush his coveted guard slot, and says he's \"ashamed\" of the deed. \"60 Minutes\" will air an interview with Barnes next Wednesday, but George HW Bush denounced Barnes' claims in an interview aired on CBS. \"They keep saying that and it's a lie, a total lie. Nobody's come up with any evidence, and yet it's repeated all the time,\" the former president said, in what could just as well describe the playbook for the Swift Boat Veterans ads. </p> <p>Yet, after receiving unusual permission to transfer to the Alabama Guard from Texas, Bush has produced no evidence he showed up for service for anything other than a dental exam. Later, Bush would trade on his father's connections to enter the oil business, and when his ventures failed, trade on more connections to find investors to bail him out. Linda Allison's story fills in the details about a missing chapter in the story of how George Bush Sr's friends helped his wastrel son. The Bush campaign, decamped to New York for the convention, did not return a phone call by late Wednesday. A graceful blonde with a Texas drawl, Linda Allison now lives on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, in an apartment decorated in the dusky tones of Tuscany with a magnificent view of the high-rises framing Central Park. I visited her there Monday on the opening night of the Republican National Convention as she related publicly for the first time her long and ultimately painful history with the Bush family. On the table between us were two photographs of her late husband -- an elfin man with curly hair, shown in animated conversation. From her drawers she pulled out old letters and notes from Barbara Bush, George HW Bush and even one from George W Bush, written to Jimmy in 1978 as he was dying of cancer. </p> <p>Jimmy Allison's family owned the Midland Reporter-Telegram and other small-town newspapers, and they were part of the establishment in the West Texas oil town where Bush senior made his fortune and Bush junior grew up. Still, Allison has been almost completely forgotten in the semi-official stories of the Bush dynasty's rise; his role as political fixer and family friend has been airbrushed out of Barbara Bush's autobiography and other accounts. But he was one of the originators of what evolved into the GOP's \"Southern strategy,\" helping George HW Bush win election to Congress in 1966 at a time when Republicans in Texas were virtually unheard of. </p> <p>The Blount Senate campaign he ran against the Democrat, Sparkman, in 1972 was notable for a dirty racial trick: The Blount side edited a transcript of a radio interview Sparkman had given to make it appear he supported busing, a poison position at that time in the South. When Sparkman found an unedited script and exposed the trick, the Blount campaign was finished. But it was an early introduction for Bush to the kinds of tricks that later Republican strategists associated with the Bush political machine would use against Democrats, often to victorious effect. </p> <p>After Bush won a House seat in 1966, Allison followed his patron to Washington as the top staffer in his congressional office and served as deputy director of the Republican National Committee in 1969 and 1970 under President Nixon. It was Allison who advised George W Bush to return to Midland after Harvard Business School to seek his business fortune in the booming oil industry, advice that Bush recalled fondly in a 2001 speech in Midland. When Allison died at age 46, after an agonising battle with lymphoma, both George HW Bush and George W Bush served as pallbearers. </p> <p>\"Aide, confidant, campaign manager, source of joke material, alter ego - Allison and Bush were bonded by an uncommon loyalty,\" former Reagan White House deputy press secretary Peter Roussel, who got his start in politics when Allison invited him to work for Bush's 1968 congressional reelection campaign, wrote in a 1988 newspaper column dedicated to Allison. </p> <p>Linda, too, had a long, though not as close, relationship with the Bushes. She remembers watching Bush in 1964 at a campaign appearance at the Adolphus Hotel in Dallas, when she was 32 years old and he was running for the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate. \"He was so appealing to me. He said all the things that I believed in, and he wasn't like all the other Republicans running in Texas at that time, who were real right-wingers. He had a bigger vision of what the Republican Party could be. I volunteered for his campaign that day, and that's how I ended up being his Dallas County headquarters chairman.\" Over the years, Linda kept volunteering with the local Republican Party. \"And they gave me bigger and bigger things to do. They appreciated me. And I felt like I belonged to something,\" she said. </p> <p>But it was also this sense of being connected to a larger, more powerful force that seduced the Allisons - a trap that many aides and friends of important politicians fall into. The dynamic allowed the Bushes -- Barbara especially, Allison said -- to manipulate the friends and supporters they needed to further their ambitions, a lesson she says could not have been lost on the young George. \"They had a way of anointing you, then pushing you out,\" she said. \"It was like a mind game. It was very subtle, very hard to describe. But when you were out, you wanted desperately to be let back in.\" It was how she and Jimmy felt when, in 1973, they experienced a strange and, to Allison, never fully explained rupture with the Bushes, which took place against the backdrop of boorish behaviour by their son that persisted during the time he was nominally under the Allisons' care. </p> <p>The break happened not long after a boozy election-night wake for Blount, who lost his Senate bid to the incumbent Democrat, John Sparkman. Leaving the election-night \"celebration,\" Allison remembers encountering George W Bush in the parking lot, urinating on a car, and hearing later about how he'd yelled obscenities at police officers that night. Bush left a house he'd rented in Montgomery trashed - the furniture broken, walls damaged and a chandelier destroyed, the Birmingham News reported in February. \"He was just a rich kid who had no respect for other people's possessions,\" Mary Smith, a member of the family who rented the house, told the newspaper, adding that a bill sent to Bush for repairs was never paid. And a month later, in December, during a visit to his parents' home in Washington, Bush drunkenly challenged his father to go \"mano a mano,\" as has often been reported. </p> <p>Around the same time, for the 1972 Christmas holiday, the Allisons met up with the Bushes on vacation in Hobe Sound, Fla. Tension was still evident between Bush and his parents. Linda was a passenger in a car driven by Barbara Bush as they headed to lunch at the local beach club. Bush, who was 26 years old, got on a bicycle and rode in front of the car in a slow, serpentine manner, forcing his mother to crawl along. \"He rode so slowly that he kept having to put his foot down to get his balance, and he kept in a weaving pattern so we couldn't get past,\" Allison recalled. \"He was obviously furious with his mother about something, and she was furious at him, too.\" Jimmy, meanwhile, had larger issues on his mind. According to Linda, he was hoping to use the visit in Florida to convince Bush to turn down the chairmanship of the Republican National Committee because he didn't trust Nixon or his palace guard. \"He had been so appalled at the Ehrlichman, Haldeman, Colson group, and he thought they'd sacrifice George. He just wanted to warn him, as a friend,\" Allison told me. </p> <p>Apparently, Jimmy Allison's advice was not appreciated. In Hobe Sound, Bush senior kept trying to avoid talking with Jimmy about the RNC, Allison said. Then later, as the Allisons took their leave, Barbara \"thanked\" them for their Christmas present with unexpected cruelty. \"She said, 'I'm so sorry, but we've been so busy this year that we didn't have time to do anything for our political acquaintances.' I swear to God, I'll never forget those two words as long as I live. For her to say that was absolutely appalling. Mind you, Jimmy was an old, old friend. And I had stayed as a houseguest with the Bushes, been invited in my pyjamas into their bedroom to read the papers and drink coffee while Bar rode her exercise bicycle. </p> <p>\"Big George was just stricken by this,\" Allison continued. \"There was a wet bar in the hall on the way to the front door. He grabbed this mouldy bottle of Mai Tai that he said had been given to him by the president of China, and he said we just had to have it. Then he plucked this ostrich egg in a beaded bag from a shelf that he said had been given to him by the ambassador to the UN from Nigeria or someplace, and gave it to us. Can you imagine how embarrassing that was?\" </p> <p>The Allisons found they were no longer being invited to the Sunday cookouts the Bushes held to chew over the week's political events. And though Jimmy had once been deputy chairman of the RNC, when Bush chaired the committee, he \"couldn't even get invited to a cocktail party there,\" Allison said. The freeze-out was subtle and surgical. \"It took us some time to realise we'd been lopped off,\" she said. At home, the Allisons once decided to try that dusty bottle of Mai Tai from China that Bush had thrust into their hands in Hobe Sound. They were unable to drink the liquor. \"It was so foul. The smell that came out of that thing! We just looked at each other,\" Allison said. </p> <p>By 1978, Jimmy was dying. Whether out of guilt, genuine affection for old times or a desire to maintain appearances with a revered member of the Midland establishment, the Bushes responded with warmth. Jimmy's heart soared, Allison said. </p> <p>George W Bush, then running unsuccessfully for Congress, wrote his old mentor a letter. \"Every person I see in Midland asks about you and sends their regards,\" Bush wrote. \"Like a younger brother, I have treasured your advice, your guidance and most importantly your never selfish friendship.\" And shortly before he died, George HW Bush - by then an executive at a bank in Houston after having served as head of the Central Intelligence Agency - invited Jimmy back to his home. Elated, Jimmy persuaded the doctors to discharge him for the visit, Linda said. But Linda, who was not consulted, was incensed. Though she drove him to the Bushes, she refused to go in. \"I was so furious. I had no way to take care of him. He was so weak, and they had taken him off the morphine, and he was in great pain,\" she said. </p> <p>In a letter to the editor of Allison's newspaper in Midland after his death, Bush recalled that day: \"He swam and relaxed. He was very weak but the warm water soothed him. He gave us hope. 'I'm going to make it,' he said.\" </p> <p>But soon after Linda picked him up, Jimmy crashed. \"He was in so much pain. It was unreal.\" At the emergency room, he waited 10 hours for medical attention. \"I begged them to do something. I begged,\" she said, wiping tears from her eyes. \"He was in so much pain. I was so angry.\" Jimmy died about a week later. </p> <p>More than a quarter century later, George W Bush is running for reelection as a \"war\" president. At the Republican Convention, delegates pass out Purple Heart stickers mocking Kerry's Vietnam wounds as \"a self-inflicted scratch,\" and George HW Bush, speaking on CNN, lauds the Swift Boat Veterans' claims against Kerry as \"rather compelling.\" Karl Rove tells the Associated Press that Kerry's opposition to a war that Bush avoided had served to \"tarnish the records and service of people who were defending our country and fighting communism.\" Barbara Bush tells USA Today: \"I die over every untruth that I hear about George - I mean, every one.\" </p> <p>Linda Allison watches it all from her New York apartment. About George W Bush's disputed sojourn in Alabama, she asks simply: \"Can we all be lying?\" Mary Jacoby is Salon's Washington correspondent.</p> <p>This article has been provided by Salon through a special arrangement with Guardian Newspapers Limited. \u00a9 Salon.com 2004 </p> <p>Visit the Salon site at <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/\"> Salon.com</a></p>",

The capital, Grozny, is still a \"barely habitable bombsite five years after its last sustained pounding from Russian artillery and aircraft,\" the paper points out, and the recent, questionable election of a Kremlin-backed president for the region has further alienated the population. </p> <p>The Guardian questions the support for Mr Putin among western governments, given his failings in Chechnya and the bloody terrorist response. \"The US wants Russian support for its own 'war on terror', so turns a blind eye to Chechnya...

  "The entry in the official \"Master Calendar of Events\" looked too good to miss: \"The Right Stuff - Conservative Comedy Show (invitation is not required)\". <p>The humour began long before the mike was switched on. The Laugh Factory club on 42nd Street seems to share an address with one of 8th Avenue's many midtown sex stores, which perhaps accounts for the fact that only a few dozen politicised punters made it along for the opening act at 7pm. </p> <p>\"Are you a journalist?\" said one intense-looking man who slid along next to me, as I sat fingering my notebook. Around my neck was a plastic photo id card emblazoned with the word, PRESS: \"Ah, in that case I don't want to sit next to you. Are there any real Republicans here?\"</p> <p>It was the same opening question put to the small audience by The Right Stuff's compere, \"Big Daddy\" Jeff Wayne. From what I could see, there were only three genuine delegates present, but the room stayed completely silent when he asked if there were any Democrats in the house. </p> <p>\"I've had people telling me there were no protesters at the Democratic Convention - well that's because they were all at the convention,\" was the opening salvo, fired leftwards. </p> <p>Mr Wayne is a self-styled \"white trash\" native of Kentucky, who now lives in California. Together with seven other right-leaning comics, he has been touring the country and Republican-friendly media circuit for the last year now. Performing in the Democratic bastion of New York City during convention week is the icing on the cake for The Right Stuff team. </p> <p>Sometimes really funny, sometimes tasteless, and sometimes just extreme, the jokes were aimed at familiar enemies of the party faithful. John Kerry, Bill Clinton, and of course, the French: </p> <p>\"I'm still angry about France, aren't you,\" said Mr Wayne, to heavy applause. \"They gave us the Statue of Liberty and we thought so much of it, we threw it right in the damn water. I want to take that torch off and put a finger on it instead.\"</p> <p>Julia Gorin, a Jewish Republican New Yorker (\"not so much a minority, but an extraterrestrial\"), performs wearing a diamond choker and a locket around her neck, containing photographs of President Bush and Condoleeza Rice. For her, Europe is a burgeoning anti-Semitic superstate: </p> <p>\"When I first heard that Europe was unifying, I gave away all my Star of David necklaces. I locked the door, turned out the lights, hid in the attic, and started a diary.\"</p> <p>On the opposition to war in Iraq, she said liberals everywhere should rejoice at the lack of WMD: \"They shouldn't think of it as a war, they should think of it as an expensive social programme. We did find Sarin and Mustard Gas - two banned chemical agents. But the Democrats even downplayed this... 'Sarin and Mustard Gas; big deal - I did those at college'.\"</p> <p>Bill Clinton never fails to raise a derisive laugh, and Ms Gorin had the best Clinton one-liner of the night: \"Bill takes the L right out of public service\". Mr Wayne's most withering gag was aimed at John Kerry's wife, Teresa, who inherited billions from her first marriage to Ketchup scion, Senator John Heinz. </p> <p>He asked if anyone had heard her convention speech last month in Boston: \"It was slow, full of vinegar, and when it was finished you just wanted to smack her bottom.\" </p> <p>The most irreverent comic on the bill was Chris Warren, who comes from a \"military background\" and owns his own comedy club in the north-western outpost of Spokane, Washington. He was wearing a white T-shirt bearing the slogan: \"comedy for real Americans\". Last year he joined US troops in Baghdad, as part of the official entertainment to lighten the post-invasion mood: </p> <p>\"I spent 22 days over there, covered that country north, south, east and west, and I'm now qualified to say about Iraq - what a shit-hole this place is... It was 130 degrees, there was no alcohol, you can't touch the women... I was ready to strap on a bomb, ok?\" </p> <p>His act was peppered with self-deprecating jokes at the expense of American redneck culture, but it was certainly no place to be for Democrats of Arab descent, or anyone with west coast environmentalist sensibilities, or - yes, the French:</p> <p>\"The next time I see Shock and Awe, I want to see the Eiffel Tower in the background,\" was Mr Warren's contribution to the diplomatic debate. There was no Machiavellian hand of Karl Rove in the script writing here.</p>",
  "The US vice-president, Dick Cheney, attacked the character and credibility of Democratic challenger John Kerry last night, describing him as a politician who has repeatedly \"made the wrong call on national security\". <p>In his address to the Republican convention, Mr Cheney praised Mr Kerry's Vietnam war record - an issue of some controversy since he has been accused of lying by rightwing veterans - but accused him of getting it wrong on national security in the three subsequent decades. </p> <p>He said the senator had opposed Ronald Reagan's defence initiatives, which he claimed had brought victory in the cold war, opposed Operation Desert Storm when Saddam Hussein stood poised to dominate the Persian Gulf and even opposed an adequate response to the September 11 attacks on America. </p> <p>The vice-president went on to ridicule Mr Kerry's plans to lead a \"more sensitive war on terror\" and his promise to defend America if it is attacked. </p> <p>\"My fellow Americans, we have already been attacked and faced with an enemy who seeks the deadliest of weapons to use against us. We cannot wait for the next attack.</p> <p>\"Senator Kerry denounces American action when other countries don't approve, as if the whole object of our foreign policy were to please a few persistent critics. </p> <p>\"In fact, in the global war on terror, as in Afghanistan and Iraq, President Bush has brought many allies to our side. But as the president has made very clear, there is a difference between leading a coalition of many and submitting to the objections of a few.\"</p> <p>With his executive past running the military supply group Halliburton, Dick Cheney has come to symbolise all that is rotten in the current White House as far as the Democratic tendency is concerned. </p> <p>A few months ago the Washington rumour mill was talking about his likely last-minute replacement by a \"balancing\" moderate - Colin Powell or Rudy Giuliani, perhaps - in order to shore up a faltering Bush campaign. </p> <p>Cheney's frail heart (he has had numerous bypasses) provides a convenient excuse for bowing out and is the reason he has made it clear he will not seek the presidency himself. </p> <p>Last night, however, he formally accepted the vice-presidential nomination, all question marks over his credibility for another term dispelled. </p> <p>Full of confidence in his central role for the remainder of the campaign, he even managed a joke at his own expense.</p> <p>\"People tell me that Senator Edwards [John Kerry's running mate] got picked for his good looks, his sex appeal and his great hair. I say to them: 'How do you think I got the job?'\"</p> <p>Few people find anything warm, charismatic or charming about Mr Cheney. Even the appearance of several generations of his immediate family on stage just after the speech failed to make him appear softer - but this is why the conservative heart of the party loves him. </p> <p>Even in that staged photo opportunity there was a hint of cold calculation: Mary Cheney, his openly lesbian daughter and campaign manager, was missing from the tableau so as not to upset the anti-gay base or divert from the night's message. </p> <p>By the time Mr Cheney took the stage, compassion fatigue had already set in, with an old-school Democrat demolishing the character and credibility of the Democrat challenger. </p> <p>When the Georgia senator Zell Miller gave the keynote address on behalf of his fellow southerner Bill Clinton in Madison Square Garden 12 years ago he had harsh words to say about the president's father, but last night the 72-year-old lambasted his own leadership and declared John Kerry unfit to even be running for the presidency. </p> <p>\"What has happened to the party I've spent my life working in? I can remember when Democrats believed that it was the duty of America to fight for freedom over tyranny,\" he said. </p> <p>\"George Bush wants to grab terrorists by the throat and not let them go, to get a better grip; from John Kerry they get a 'yes, no, maybe' bowl of mush that can only encourage our enemies, and confuse our friends.\"</p> <p>The former marine, who says he will never leave the Democratic party despite his disgust, delivered a tirade that would have sounded more like a crazed rant had it come from the lips of a veteran Republican. </p> <p>The conservative base of the party inside the hall lapped it up, especially when he tore into the Massachusetts senator's record of voting against military spending. </p> <p>\"This is the man who wants to be the commander in chief of our US armed forces. US forces armed with what - spit balls? </p> <p>Zell Miller has long been outside the Democratic fold, and the personal bitterness evident in his speech will not have surprised seasoned party strategists. </p> <p>In the fluid world of American party politics it is impossible to say what extra weight his fratricidal attack may have carried for voters watching at home. </p> <p>It was certainly the most aggressive and damning assault yet on John Kerry's values by any mainstream politician. </p> <p>\"Twenty years of votes can tell you much more about a man than 20 weeks of campaign rhetoric,\" he said. \"Senator Kerry has made it clear that he would use military force only if approved by the United Nations. Kerry would let Paris decide when America needs defending. I want Bush to decide.\" </p> <p>In praising the president towards the end of his briskly delivered attack, he slipped heavily into hyperbole that delighted the audience. </p> <p>\"I have knocked on the doors of this man's soul and found someone home: a God-fearing man with a good heart and a spine of tempered steel.\" </p> <p>The address prompted Mr Cheney, master of the understatement, to ad-lib a line at the very top of his prepared speech: \"I'm sure glad Zell Miller is on our side.\"</p>",

  "<p>Last week, at the Edinburgh television festival, John Humphrys had a go at television. He spoke of mind-numbing, witless vulgarity, and of television's obsession with sex. </p> <p>Humphrys doesn't think it's all bad. The best is very good, he says, better than it ever was. But there's an awful lot of mediocre stuff out there. And the bad TV is not just bad, it's damaging, meretricious, seedy and cynical. </p> <p>Of course, reality television took a bashing, with Big Brother getting a special mention. Reality isn't just mediocre, puerile and pointless, said Humphrys, it's actually damaging. He spoke about the ritual humiliation of the people who take part, and about humans being turned into freaks to be gawped at. </p> <p>So last night I tuned in to <strong>Junior Mastermind</strong> (BBC1), to see how television should be made. Junior Mastermind, like its big brother (whoops, sorry John), is presented by Humphrys. </p> <p>Imagine my surprise then, when I found myself gawping at four humans who were being ritually humiliated for my entertainment. And it gets worse, because these were also children. Daniel, Laura, Charles and Yolanda, all aged 10 or 11, exposed and lonely in that enormous leather chair. The room was darkened, a spotlight trained on the victim, and then the great interrogator began his grilling. </p> <p>There was a winner at the end: Daniel scored by far the most with 25 points and goes through to the final on Friday. But there was also a loser. National television is a very public place to get the fewest points. Poor Yolanda, I wonder if she'll ever get over it. </p> <p>Between rounds Humphrys made conversation with the children. Laura spoke Japanese on demand, like a parrot. And Daniel had to explain why he liked the Volkswagen Beetle, the history of which he'd chosen as his specialised subject. </p> <p>\"The Beetle is not exactly the sort of sexiest car really is it?\" said Humphrys, bringing sex into it. Inappropriately, I'd say. </p> <p>\"You don't have to have a good-looking car to be car of the century,\" said Daniel, tactfully removing sex from the discussion. </p> <p>Humphrys tried avarice: \"So if someone offered you a choice between a Beetle and a Ferrari, what would you say?\" </p> <p>Daniel stuck to his principles, and the Beetle. But Humphrys wouldn't let it go. \"You could have a Ferrari and sell it and buy 100 Beetles, couldn't you?\" he said, trying to impose his own materialistic values on the poor child. Luckily Daniel is made of pretty strong moral fibre and successfully deflected Humphrys' attempts at corruption. A lesser man than Daniel would almost certainly been tempted into Humphrys' evil traps. </p> <p>So it's clearly a highly damaging experience for the contestants. But that would possibly be justified if it was great entertainment for the viewer. It isn't. It's just a quiz show, and not a particularly imaginative one. Humphrys asks questions, the contestants answer them, their answers are either right or wrong. Sometimes, thrillingly, they pass on a question. And, as in the grown-up version, you have to sit through the boring specialised subject round first, before you can compare - usually depressingly - your own feeble knowledge of trivia with theirs. Yolanda may be interested in the Girls in Love series by Jacqueline Wilson, but I'm not. Nor am I particularly interested in how much Yolanda knows about the Girls in Love series by Jacqueline Wilson. </p> <p>It's not bad television, but it certainly isn't thought-provoking, imaginative or original. Mediocre probably best describes it. And possibly puerile and pointless too. </p> <p>From <strong>The L Word</strong> (Living TV), I learnt the expression \"bush confident\", which I first took to mean the certainty some people have that the Republicans will prevail in the November US presidential elections. But then I was thrown when the phrase \"nipple confident\" came up a bit later. I thought he was called Kerry. And then it occurred to me that this wasn't actually a political debate at all. </p> <p>This new American import, which is causing all sort of ripples over there, is about the lively love lives of a lot of libidinous Los Angeles lesbians. The L Word itself I think refers to the last of those, though it could be any of them. Or possibly licking, as a fair amount of that goes on too. It's all thoroughly educational. I wonder what John Humphrys would make of it.</p>",
  "The sacked Blairite union leader Shaun Brady was privately supported by a government minister and rail company director in his battle with leftwingers for control of the industrially powerful Aslef train drivers' union, according to private correspondence seen by the Guardian. <p>The transport minister Kim Howells, and BAA, operators of the Heathrow Express link, were accused last night of interfering in the running of the Labour party affiliated union. </p> <p>In a handwritten message to the Aslef general secretary in April, Mr Howells, the minister of state responsible for the rail industry, said he was unable to attend the union's annual conference in Scarborough but he sought an urgent chat with Mr Brady, \"so that you might fill me in on the situtation re the national executive\". </p> <p>Potentially more damaging to Mr Brady's hope of overturning last month's dismissal after a disciplinary hearing is the disclosure that the inaugural speech he was to have delivered to the conference in June was written by a senior manager. </p> <p>An email marked \"private and confidential\" shows that the 12-page address, including a strong attack on the executive, was produced by Stephen Hardwick, BAA's director of public affairs. </p> <p>The involvement of an employer in the writing of a union leader's keynote speech is highly unusual if not unprecedented in recent years, and the Aslef general secretary faces charges of collaborating with bosses. </p> <p>Aslef called strikes on the Heathrow Express last year under Mr Brady's leftwing predecessor Mick Rix, and the company's involvement will fuel suggestions that rail companies secretly campaigned to defeat Mr Rix in an Aslef election last year. </p> <p>Andy Reed, Aslef's national organiser, said: \"You have to ask yourself how is it that the general secretary of Aslef had so few allies in the union that he had to use a bosses' mouthpiece to write his speeches? </p> <p>\"Our members will want to know why employers, ministers and government advisers were invited to interfere in our union's internal affairs when it is our duty to be wholly independent to represent our members.\" </p> <p>Mr Brady, who is planning to appeal against his sacking afster May's now infamous barbecue punch-up with the president, Martin Samways, in the garden of union-owned flats next to its Hampstead headquarers, rejected the allegations last night </p> <p>He said he had never met Mr Howells to discuss his confrontation with the executive. The BAA director's aid with the speech, never delivered because the Aslef conference was postponed, was received in a personal capacity after Mr Hardwick's involvement was proposed by a mutual political contact, a figure the Guardian understands is a Labour MP. </p> <p>\"I asked him to help me, I just needed a bit of assistance. Certainly it was nothing to do with BAA,\" said Mr Brady, who met Mr Hardwick twice, once to discuss the speech and then to receive a 12-page draft. </p> <p>Mr Rix, on holiday in Scotland, said: \"I said when the election result was announced that we had been beaten by powerful and vested interests and that dark forces were involved. </p> <p>\"These revelations prove that there was collusion and a concerted campaign by employers and some politicians, not only to remove me from office but to destabilise and wreck a proud and historic trade union.\" </p> <p>Mr Hardwick, who advised the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, when he was in opposition, said he wrote the address in a personal capacity. </p> <p>\"I have got no relationship with Aslef. I was asked to write a speech by a friend to help out someone who he supported.\" </p> <p>A spokesman for Mr Howells said: \"It was nowhere near interfering with the internal workings of a union.\" </p> <p>Mr Brady accused Aslef opponent of leaking letters to undermine his appeal. </p> <p>\"This is not a witch hunt against me, it is a witches' coven. They are trying to twist an angle against me. There was no deceit. If there was deceit in this, there would be no emails,\" he said.</p>",
  "The Bush campaign last night sent vice-president Dick Cheney on the attack against John Kerry, portraying the Democratic challenger as a man ill-suited to lead the country at a \"defining moment\" in its history. <p>In his speech to the Republican convention, Mr Cheney dwelt on what he described as Senator Kerry's shifting positions on critical issues of war and peace, and said he did not have the resolve the country needed. </p> <p>\"Moments come along in history when leaders must make fundamental decisions about how to confront a long-term challenge abroad and how best to keep the American people secure. This nation has reached another of those defining moments,\" he said, according to early excerpts from his speech. </p> <p>\"And on the question of America's role in the world, the differences between Senator Kerry and President Bush are the sharpest, and the stakes for the country are the highest.\" </p> <p>The president arrived in New York last night to watch his deputy's performance from a fire station in Queens, reinforcing a persistent theme of the convention - the president's resolve following the September 11 attacks, and his supposed bond with survivors. </p> <p>His speech tonight is expected to restate his determination to mount an offensive war against foreign terrorists and set out a programme of domestic reform aimed at rewriting the tax code and privatising government pensions. </p> <p>Earlier yesterday, Karl Rove, the president's chief political strategist, also went on the offensive, alleging that Mr Kerry's anti-war activism after his return from Vietnam \"tarnished the records and service\" of fellow veterans. </p> <p>The Kerry campaign denounced the remarks as \"outrageous\" but they again put the Democratic camp on the defensive over his war record. </p> <p>Attacks by anti-Kerry veterans, accusing him of lying about his war record, appear to have had an impact at the polls. A narrow Kerry lead at the beginning of last month has been turned into a small edge for Mr Bush in the past two weeks. </p> <p>Rumours spread yesterday of dissatisfaction among senior Democrats over how Mr Kerry has handled the Bush assault on his Vietnam record. He showed signs he was taking the criticism seriously by hiring new staff, including such veterans of the Clinton era as the former White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart. </p> <p>Mr Kerry also hit back yesterday, attempting to switch the debate from the Vietnam war to the Iraq conflict. He ditched a political tradition under which a presidential candidate refrains from campaigning during his opponent's party convention, and appeared before the annual meeting of the biggest veterans' group, the American Legion, in Nashville, Tennessee. </p> <p>\"I would never have gone to war without a plan to win the peace,\" he said. \"President Bush now admits he miscalculated in Iraq. In truth, his miscalculation was ignoring the advice that was given to him, including the best advice of America's own military.\" </p> <p>Mr Kerry criticised the president for admitting on Monday that the \"war on terror\" could not be won, an admission Mr Bush retracted in his own address to the American Legion on Tuesday. He said the US \"is winning\" and \"will win\". </p> <p>Adding to Mr Kerry's woes was the news yesterday that Ralph Nader, the independent third candidate in the race, had succeeded in collecting enough signatures to put his name on the ballot in the pivotal swing state of Florida.</p>",
  "Simon Hughes, the former London mayoral candidate, pledged the Liberal Democrats would become the next party of government yesterday after he was elected party president with a resounding majority. <p>The former home affairs spokesman used the analogy of the Olympics to claim the Lib Dems had normally won bronze, were now winning silver, but needed to \"go for gold.\"</p> <p>Referring to Lib Dem claims that the party could be in power in 2009, he said: \"You don't overstate it. You don't claim you're going to win every seat in the country at the next election, but you keep on building. </p> <p>\"Our aim is to be the next party of government and we will get there as soon as the electorate allow us.\" </p> <p>Mr Hughes's optimism came after he polled 71% of the vote in the contest, with 47% of the party's 75,000 members returning ballot papers - the highest turnout since 1988. </p> <p>His rival, the leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats, Lembit Opik, who polled 10,002 votes to Mr Hughes's 24,333, said he was \"obviously disappointed\" not to have won, but indicated he would re-apply when the job comes free in four years' time. He offered Mr Hughes his \"absolute support and loyalty\". </p> <p>Mr Hughes, MP for Southwark and Bermondsey, said that, as president, he would \"build our appeal ... and make sure the message reaches members more effectively than, to be honest, it has.\" </p> <p>His experience as an MP for 21 years in inner-city London, who was brought up in rural England and Wales, would prove a welcome addition to his leader, Charles Kennedy's more limited experience, he suggested. </p> <p>\"There is a difference I hope I can bring. Charles represents a very rural seat in Scotland. I represent a hugely urban, mixed community seat in inner city London, and was brought up in rural villages ... I hope I can bring an understanding of how we need to win rural ... suburban ... and urban seats in England, Scotland and Wales,\" he said. </p> <p>The party is ambitious to win up to 80 seats - up from its current 56 - at next year's anticipated election, and he pledged to work \"flat out\" to boost income and membership. </p> <p>Mr Kennedy, who beat Mr Hughes to the leadership in 1999 and forced him to step down from his home affairs brief this year, was swift to congratulate him. </p> <p>\"He has been an excellent constituency MP for the last 21 years and I know he will serve the party with the same commitment and enthusiasm as president,\" he said.</p>",
  "Russia last night called an emergency session of the UN security council as it sought to drum up international support for its battle against the sudden upsurge in terrorist acts committed by suspected Chechen militants in the past eight days. <p>Andrei Denisov, the Russian ambassador to the UN, requested the evening meeting to secure formal international condemnation of the kidnapping of scores of children in a school in southern Russia. </p> <p>The White House was swift to offer Vladimir Putin support. \"We stand with the Russian people,\" a spokeswoman for George Bush said last night after the US president put in a personal call to his Russian counterpart. </p> <p>\"Both leaders stressed their strong commitment to working together to defeat global terrorism,\" the spokeswoman said, in a message the Kremlin interpreted as an offer of American help in its own war on terror. </p> <p>Yesterday's attack on the school in Beslan, North Ossetia, followed a suicide bombing outside a Moscow metro station the previous day and last week's double bombing of two passenger aircraft. More than 100 people have been killed. </p> <p>Analysts said the UN move was aimed at shoring up international support for any military action Russia might take against militant attacks. </p> <p>Russia is unlikely to approach the UN for logistical support in any military action, given its proud assertion that the Russian military can deal with the Chechen problem. Yet a UN security council resolution backing Russia's right to take military action to secure its population from the terrorist threat would silence critics of its continuing military actions in Chechnya. </p> <p>It could place any future military activity on a par with Washington's decision to invade Afghanistan after September 11, with which last week's double plane crash has been compared. </p> <p>The Kremlin had remained silent for hours after news of the attack on the Beslan school, struggling to square its fiery rhetoric about vanquishing terrorists with the potential public outrage at a bloody outcome to its second major hostage crisis at the hands of militants in two years. </p> <p>Just before news broke of the Beslan crisis, President Putin reiterated that Russia would have no truck with terrorists. Reacting to the suicide bombing in Moscow, he said he was prepared to talk to anyone in Chechnya, bar separatists and terrorists. </p> <p>\"There can be no dialogue with those who wanted to fight and who made war a way of earning money,\" he said. \"We shall fight against them, throw them in prisons and destroy them.\" </p> <p>President Putin's top two law enforcement ministers, security service head Nikolai Patrushev and interior minister Rashid Nurgaliyev, were sent to the Beslan school to take command of the rescue operation. </p> <p>The Kremlin faced considerable public criticism for its handling of the boldest terrorist act to hit the Putin presidency: the October 2002 Dubrovka theatre siege in which more than 800 theatregoers were taken hostage by 40 gunmen. </p> <p>The siege was ended when special forces released a gas into the building, killing 129 hostages and the gunmen. The victims' relatives remain incensed at how opaque the events of the siege remain and the poor medical care given to their relatives immediately after the event. </p> <p>Mr Putin's opinion poll rating slumped recently to its lowest since he sought re-election in March. His image as a man of stability and order lifts him above his competitors, yet he cannot afford another show of Russian force to end in hundreds more dead hostages.</p>",
  "Tony Blair yesterday placed \"seven key policies challenges\" - designed to improve opportunity and security for all classes - at the centre of Labour's strategy for winning a third term. <p>He used a brief speech to party workers at Labour's HQ in Westminster to reject any suggestion that the government can campaign either on its record or on Conservative failings. \"The key to renewing our political support for the coming years is policy,\" Mr Blair declared. </p> <p>One No 10 aide explained: \"We want to keep up the momentum we had before the August break. It's policy that drives the politics.\" </p> <p>Explaining that economic stability, high employment, reformed public services and constitutional modernisation had been the main Labour challenges since 1997, Mr Blair listed the new policy areas: </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> wider economic and educational opportunity for a \"larger majority\" as Europe faces growing US competition; </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> personalised public services that meet higher voter expectations for health and education; </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> doing more for the minority of poor people and neighbourhoods amid affluence; </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> balancing tougher law and order policies with respect for civil liberties; </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> promoting retirement \"as an opportunity not a threat\"; </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> tackling immigration abuses while defending multi-culturalism against extremism; </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> building international support for vital policies such as climate change. </p> <p>Mr Blair said: \"There is one key test that every policy decision should pass. Does it, in practical terms, advance and improve the lives of Britain's hard working families in the future? Does it help provide opportunity and security for them in a world of constant and rapid change?\" </p> <p>Though the prime minister offered no specific new remedies he promised initiatives in a dozen policy areas over the next six months - ranging from cutting red tape for business and better vocational education to universal childcare options for the under-fives and better pensions planning. </p> <p>Dismissing his critics as peddlers of \"the politics of pessimism and anxiety,\" Mr Blair twisted the knife in Michael Howard who was also in campaign mode yesterday. </p> <p>\"This responsibility to address the future clearly is ever more important to us as, frankly, the Tories flounder, incapable of the bold renewal, top to bottom, that their party needs. Only this party, Labour, is facing the future with confidence,\" he claimed. </p> <p>It is Mr Blair's conviction that the Tory leader is an attack dog without a strategic vision who is quickly coming to grief. Speaking during a walkabout in Hove yesterday, Mr Howard warned that politically correct attitudes and red tape are preventing the police from doing their job properly. </p> <p>\"We are told that it will take seven minutes on average for a police officer to fill in the forms, and we are not talking about stop and search here. </p> <p>\"We are talking about every time a police officer simply stops someone in the street and says 'what are doing here and where do you live?'\" Mr Howard said. </p> <p>It was Mr Howard's bad luck that he attacked Labour's anti-social behaviour orders (Asbos) on the very day they were praised by the Daily Telegraph. Mr Blair, though not all Labour MPs, will take comfort from that.</p>",
  "<p>My dear prime minister, thank you for inviting me to take over as head of e-government following the unexpected election of the previous appointee, Ian Watmore, as president of Iraq. Perhaps it was a mistake to test e-voting technology in such a volatile environment as Baghdad. None the less, Ian will relish the challenge of sorting out the Middle East. </p> <p>As my computer does not have PowerPoint, I was unable to read Ian's briefing material. In any case, I thought some a priori propositions might be welcome. Here are some early thoughts. </p> <p>First, we should halve the number of websites run by central government. My office will take a lead by amalgamating two web portals, Directgov and Government Gateway, together with the Cabinet Office's own site, at the single address <a href=\"http://www.direct.gov.uk\">www.direct.gov.uk</a>. </p> <p>This would prepare the way for a campaign to drive up usage. The current strategy, relying on the site's indeterminate nationality to attract hits from every English-speaking country, is having limited success. We should immediately activate phase two and display a small EU flag on the home page. The resulting furore should increase the number of unique visitors. </p> <p>Across government, we should implement Sir Peter Gershon's efficiency review suggestions for increasing the take-up of online transactions. Car tax renewals and company VAT returns are an obvious place to start. Both services need to stop pussy-footing around with pilots and soft launches, even if back-office systems still leave much to be desired. </p> <p>Companies could be encouraged to file their VAT returns electronically with a small discount. I suggest 5%. Car owners likewise. Electorally, these measures would do you no harm in two crucial constituencies. </p> <p>Important as the efficiency drive is, it should not be allowed to dominate the e-government programme. Apart from anything else, there is still little evidence for a connection between the two. Rather, I suggest that e-government be considered as an enabler in two other policy themes: new localism and freedom of information. </p> <p>Local authorities should have the option of offering residents access to central e-services. This is a reversal of the current policy of assuming that citizens will sign on for local government through a Whitehall-run portal. Councils working this way would, of course, receive a share of the money they save central government. </p> <p>As for freedom of information, it should be policy that every document produced by government should be posted on the deep web, unless there is a good reason not to. Documents withheld should be publicly identified with a reference number and the reason for secrecy. </p> <p>First, however, we need to shed a millstone. The target of e-enabling every single service by the end of 2005 has served its purpose. We should abandon it as superseded, replacing it with \"priority outcomes\", along the lines of those handed down to local authorities. A grown-up government should not be afraid to admit changing its mind in the light of developments. We are a grown-up government, aren't we? </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Send comments to <a href=\"MAILTO:online.feedback@theguardian.com\">online.feedback@theguardian.com</a>.
