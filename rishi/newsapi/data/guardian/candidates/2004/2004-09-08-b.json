  "John Kerry accused the Bush administration of raiding state pension funds to pay for its \"mistakes\" in Iraq yesterday as the campaign rhetoric expended on the \"war on terror\" continued to grow. <p>The previous day Vice-President Dick Cheney suggested that Mr Kerry's victory could lead to another terrorist attack on the US, and the row about the Vietnam war was given a new turn by the publication of documents suggesting that George Bush failed to fulfil his obligations as a National Guard pilot. </p> <p>Mr Kerry was speaking in the very Cincinnati hall that heard the president make his case for going to war in Iraq nearly two years ago. </p> <p>Addressing a few hundred trade unionists and war veterans in Ohio city's old railway terminal, he accused the president of breaking his pre-invasion promise to go to war only as a last resort and then at the head of a coalition. </p> <p>\"George W Bush made the wrong choices. He himself now admits he miscalculated in Iraq,\" Mr Kerry said. </p> <p>\"Because of this president's wrong choices, we're spending $200bn in Iraq while we're running up deficits that threaten social security. In fact, they're raiding the social security trust fund to pay for their mistakes in Iraq.\" </p> <p>The Bush campaign responded by accusing Mr Kerry of hypocrisy, pointing out that a year ago he had called for more war spending: in August 2003 he told an interviewer that the US should spend \"whatever number of billions of dollars it takes to win. It is critical that the United States of America is successful in Iraq\". </p> <p>\"Kerry's constantly shifting positions on the war on terror are hurting his credibility with the American people,\" Steve Schmidt, its spokesman said. </p> <p>Mr Kerry was aiming to tie the costs of the war with economic dissatisfaction at home. </p> <p>His campaign has been criticised by other Democrats for focusing too much on security policy, on which the president has his strongest ratings, and not enough on economic problems, where Mr Bush is weakest. Yesterday's speech appeared to represent an attempt to bridge the two strategies. </p> <p>A new Kerry campaign advertisement broadcast yesterday made similar charges, linking war spending with lost jobs and rising healthcare costs, concluding: \"George Bush's wrong choices have weakened us here at home.\" </p> <p>It reflected the increasingly shrill tone of the contest less than two months before polling. In his address on Tuesday, Mr Cheney went further than anyone in the administration. </p> <p>He said: \"It's absolutely essential that eight weeks from today, on November 2, we make the right choice. Because if we make the wrong choice, then the danger is that we'll get hit again.\" </p> <p>Democrats were outraged. John Edwards, the party's vice-presidential candidate, said it was \"un-American\", adding: \"Dick Cheney's scare tactics crossed the line today.\" </p> <p>The attack on Mr Bush's National Guard record responded to the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth attack on Mr Kerry's Vietnam record. </p> <p>Advertisements by Texans for Truth questioned whether Mr Bush had turned up for duty in the Air National Guard in Alabama and the Boston Globe published an article which concluded that \"Bush fell well short of meeting his military obligation\". </p> <p>The Bush campaign rejected the allegation, saying the president \"served honourably and was discharged honourably\".</p>",
  "Republicans marched out of their convention intoxicated with the sensation of victory. President Bush, the \"war president\", was the most honest, moral, decisive, and strongest leader in the world. (The unvarying encomiums eerily echoed those of the brainwashed soldiers about the sleeper agent in The Manchurian Candidate: \"Raymond Shaw is the kindest, warmest, bravest, most wonderful human being I've ever known in my life.\") <p>After Bush's defiant speech - \"Nothing will hold us back!\" - his lead was reported by Time magazine to have climbed to 11 points, which was inhaled like pure oxygen by the Republican cadres. (Both John Kerry's and Bush's internal polls gave Bush only a four-point lead.) </p> <p>Kerry seemed to be reeling in retreat. His disciplined campaign management had suppressed criticism of Bush, supposedly on the basis that swing voters are attracted by vague swirls of optimism. But the effect was that voters remained confused about the contrast between the candidates and Kerry's commitments. Kerry had delayed defending himself against the torpedoes of falsehood fired at his heroic military record by the Orwellianly named Swift Boat Veterans for Truth. </p> <p>Perhaps his gravest self-inflicted wound was replying to Bush's challenge to answer whether he would still have voted for the war resolution on Iraq, knowing what he does today. Kerry said he would and tangled himself in a thicket of sticky nuance. </p> <p>Bush could hardly believe that Kerry had fallen for the gambit. This sucker would buy a bridge in Brooklyn. The triumphant Republicans felt unrestrained in delivering blows to the prone Kerry. Dick Cheney announced that a vote against Bush was tantamount to a vote for a terrorist attack: \"If we make the wrong choice then the danger is that we'll get hit again.\" </p> <p>On the day that former President Clinton had his heart surgery, Cheney attacked him as weak on terrorism, and for good measure set upon Ronald Reagan too. The venerated Reagan had served his purpose as an icon at the convention, but now he was unceremoniously thrown overboard. </p> <p>Only Bush was tough enough. Bush, adopting the tone of the fraternity house president he once was, sarcastically derided Kerry: \"No matter how many times Senator Kerry flip-flops, we were right to make America safer by removing Saddam Hussein from power.\" </p> <p>In fact, on the third day of the Republican convention, Kerry had given a penetrating and highly specific speech on the war on terrorism and Iraq, detailing how Bush's strategy amounted to a series of catastrophic blunders. \"When it comes to Iraq,\" he said, \"it's not that I would have done one thing differently, I would have done almost everything differently.\" </p> <p>Kerry's speech was pointedly ignored by Bush who, with Cheney, rained a steady fire of ridicule down on Kerry. Meanwhile, the report on Iraq by the Royal Institute of International Affairs was buried in the back pages. \"Iraq could splinter into civil war and destabilise the whole region if the interim government, US forces and United Nations fail to hold the ring among factions struggling for power.\" Civil war, the institute said, was \"the most likely outcome\". Kerry remarked that because of Bush's errors \"terrorists have secured havens in Iraq that were not there before\". The New York Times reported that Fallujah and many other cities in the Sunni triangle are under the control of Islamist insurgents. But Bush steadfastly refused to engage Kerry in debate. A report chronicling the undermining of the war against terrorism by James Fallows in The Atlantic, in which numerous military officials described how Afghanistan became a \"sideshow\" as resources were siphoned to Iraq, received almost no attention. \"Our strategy is succeeding,\" Bush told his jubilant rallies. </p> <p>Bush campaigns before the faithful; distressing facts are dismissed with sarcasm and ideology is implacable. Yet at this moment of disdain a discovery that cast light on Bush's character suddenly emerged, having the potential to alter the momentum of the campaign. </p> <p> On Wednesday, the Boston Globe published documents proving that Bush, whose spotty record in the National Guard was always mysterious, \"fell well short of meeting his military obligation\". Maj Gen Paul A Weaver Jr., who retired in 2002 as the Pentagon's director of the Air National Guard, was quoted: \"It appears that no one wanted to hold him accountable.\" </p> <p>That night, CBS's 60 Minutes broadcast the first interview with former Texas lieutenant governor Ben Barnes, who explained how he contrived to get young George his safe posting in the \"champagne unit\" of the Texas Air National Guard during the Vietnam war. The programme also revealed further documents showing he never fulfilled his service. </p> <p>Abruptly, the Republican marchers stumble as Kerry is galvanised. \"His miscalculation was going to war without planning carefully and without the allies we should have had,\" he said yesterday. Meanwhile in the White House, aides anxiously wonder how to explain the president's haunted past and his long years of hiding it and who will have the task of facing the cameras. </p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>Sidney Blumenthal, a former senior adviser to President Clinton, is Washington bureau chief of <a href=\"http://www.salon.com\">salon.com</a> </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:sidney_blumenthal@yahoo.com\">sidney_blumenthal@yahoo.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan appeared to clear the path for another rise in US interest rates yesterday when he delivered a moderately upbeat assessment of the country's economy which has slowed in recent months because of high oil prices. </p> <p>Testifying before the House of Representatives Budget Committee, Greenspan said: \"The most recent data suggest that, on the whole, the expansion has regained some traction. We still have problems ... but I think I agree with you in general that the economy is doing reasonably well.\" </p> <p>Greenspan's remarks are likely to be seized upon by President George Bush as proof that the economy, which threatens to be his weak point in the run-up to the presidential election on November 2, has turned the corner. Democratic challenger John Kerry repeatedly talks of the job losses and economic weakness under Bush since 2001. </p> <p>Economists and financial markets had billed Greenspan's testimony as key to whether the Fed would decide that the economy's recent \"soft patch\", as Greenspan has dubbed it, would mean it could hold off raising its Fed Funds rate from 1.5% when it meets on September 21. </p> <p>The Fed has raised rates twice in the past three months from a 46-year low of just 1%. Analysts are expecting the central bank to raise them to 1.75% in two weeks' time and that they will keep gradually rising after that. </p> <p>Greenspan said factors like consumer spending and housebuilding had picked up after a slowdown in the spring and early summer. </p> <p>The 78-year Fed chief also appeared fairly relaxed about the impact of record highs in oil prices which have been blamed for slowing economy activity. The economy grew 2.8% on an annualised basis in the second quarter of this year, sharply down from 4.5% in the January to March period. </p> <p>Oil prices hit a record $49.40 a barrel last month but have since dropped back to the low $40s. </p> <p>\"Despite the rise in oil prices through mid-August, inflation and inflation expectations have eased in recent months,\" Greenspan said, although he added it was extremely difficult to say what impact high oil prices were having on the economy. </p> <p>On the issue of the government's swelling budget deficit, Greenspan warned of the importance of a balanced budget in the long term. He appeared to offer implicit backing to Mr Bush's tax cuts, however. </p> <p>\"If we cut taxes, we will, other things equal, increase economic growth. I ... would much prefer to have both lower taxes and lower spending, but of necessity a balanced budget. </p> <p>\"Others may choose higher taxes and higher spending. I think that would make the level of economic activity less, but that's a debatable point.\"</p>",
  "For three and a half hours he didn't duck a question, though he occasionally showed flashes of anger and slapped the table to make his point. He didn't take notes, but gave complex answers point by point. <p>If Vladimir Putin was feeling the pressure after possibly his worst week in office, it didn't show. During a rare and wide-ranging interview at his country house outside Moscow, the president enthralled a group of handpicked journalists and academics, giving candid comments that offered surprising insights. </p> <p>He was tough on Chechnya, but soft on George Bush. He castigated the west over terrorism, but was ambivalent about Nato. </p> <p>Addressing questions surrounding the Beslan massacre, Mr Putin elaborated on comments he had made in a national TV address on Saturday evening in which he accused outside powers of wanting to \"tear juicy bits off Russia\" and supporting terrorists who were doing the same thing. </p> <p>\"I didn't say western countries were initiating terrorism, and I didn't say it was policy. But we've observed incidents. It's a replay of the mentality of the cold war. There are certain people who want us to be focused on internal problems and they pull strings here so that we don't raise our heads internationally,\" he said. </p> <p>At several points during the conversation, Mr Putin outlined his fears of a \"domino effect\" if Islamists succeeded in detaching Chechnya from Russia. Other parts of the Caucasus would then go too. He saw a parallel with the collapse of the Soviet Union which he, like many Russians, clearly regretted. </p> <p>He does not want to follow in the footsteps of Mikhail Gorbachev, who is widely reviled for supposedly letting the Soviet Union fall apart. </p> <p>\"Has anyone given a thought to what would happen if Russia were eliminated? We will not allow that to happen. We understand what it would mean for the people of Russia,\" he said, striking the table again with his hand. </p> <p>He said Russia's open southern and central Asian borders could not easily be defended against infiltrators, and would have to be strengthened gradually. But the president made it clear beyond doubt that he had not changed his policy on Chechnya after Beslan. </p> <p>Despite all the differences over Iraq, Mr Putin gave a strong hint yesterday that he is privately hoping that Mr Bush wins the US presidential election. Asked about a poll which showed that 25% of Russians favoured a Kerry victory and only 7% a Bush one, the president smiled and said: \"Russians don't vote in American elections but the 7% includes a few very influential people.\" </p> <p>He then launched into a long paean of praise for his American counterpart. </p> <p>\"Bush is a man of consistency. He's predictable. Even if we have some differences of opinion, for example on Iraq, he's been very reliable. I feel he's a good man, a decent man.\" </p> <p>He added: \"Positive relations between the United States and Russia should be preserved.\" </p> <p>Mr Putin made no mention of the Democratic challenger. </p> <p>Although Russia would not send troops or join in training the Iraqi army and police, he said: \"We want to do everything to normalise things there. I think Bush has done a lot to normalise the situation. Given all the complexities, he's been able to achieve his aims. We will refrain from anything which might be met negatively by the Iraqi people.\" </p> <p>The Russian leader's remarks came during an extraordinary meeting at his country house at Novo Ogaryevo. The participants were veteran experts on Russia, from Britain, the US, France, and Germany, who had been invited for a two-day conference long before the school siege. </p> <p>Fears that pressure of work or irritation with western criticism of his policies in Chechnya might prompt him to cancel the meeting proved unfounded. Although he began stiffly by saying the events of the last few days would probably preclude discussion, he took searching questions. </p> <p>The president frequently smiled as he parried criticisms of his policies or slipped in a few English words like the \"US is a melting pot\" into his answers. On some issues, he even joked. </p> <p>Challenged about the pressure on the media, which saw the editor of the newspaper Izvestiya sacked yesterday - the latest of many recent moves against the independent press - Mr Putin said: \"What about Mr Murdoch's empire? Are his media free?\" </p> <p>On Chechnya, he was angered by what he saw as western hypocrisy. In spite of the west's stated willingness to cooperate on terrorism, \"when we register cases when western special services establish contact with so-called rebels, they say it's an exceptional case, and it won't be repeated, and then they send us a letter saying they need to maintain contacts with all sorts of people\". </p> <p>He singled out Britain and Spain, apparently having in mind the decision by Britain to grant asylum to Akhmed Zakayev, the European envoy of Chechnya's last freely elected president, Aslan Maskhadov. </p> <p>In spite of repeatedly talking about the threat to Russia's future from terrorism, he was relaxed on the other traditional bugbear, Nato. Like Boris Yeltsin, his predecessor, Mr Putin vigorously opposed eastward expansion of Nato. </p> <p>Now he sees Nato as both prone to irrelevance and internal decay, but also as a broadly positive institution. </p> <p>\"We no longer regard Nato as an enemy, nor do we consider it effective from a military point of view. We see it as a political tool,\" he said. \"It's obvious that processes are under way in Nato to find a new opponent. Otherwise what's its point?\" </p> <p>Spelling out even more directly that, in his view, Nato is mainly an instrument for Washington to retain hegemony in Europe, he went on: \"I don't think Nato is so democratically organised. Some members are not very happy with their status.\" </p> <p>With an element of contradiction, he added: \"That being said, I wouldn't want to see Nato's burial. It exists, and it's important for international security and we want international security.\" </p> <p>The Russian leader made it clear he has no problems with neighbouring Ukraine joining the European Union. </p> <p>He was also strongly critical of Georgia and its new president, Mikhail Saakashvili, for attempts to get the breakaway region of South Ossetia back under its rule after 10 years of de facto independence. </p> <p>The Russian president foresaw a scenario in which Georgian troops moved into the rebel region. </p> <p>\"I suspect they may use force. It won't be productive even if in the initial stage they capture the capital, Tskhinvali. It will be a long and exhausting process,\" he said. </p> <p>Although some analysts have seen a parallel between Russia's military move into Chechnya and Georgia's possible invasion of South Ossetia, Mr Putin clearly saw none. </p> <p>Russia's policy in Chechnya was different. He had organised a referendum in Chechnya in 2003. \"I was the only one in the Russian leadership who favoured the idea. It was a risky decision. But Chechens turned out and voted to stay in Russia,\" he said.</p>",
  "Forecasts of John Kerry's political demise may have been exaggerated in recent days, and he could still be clinging to a narrow lead in the US presidential race, according to a poll published yesterday. <p>The poll, by Zogby International, reflected the state of play in 20 swing states, and found that the surge in George Bush's support there after last week's Republican convention, was less pronounced than the double-digits suggested in two weekend polls. </p> <p>Those surveys, in Time and Newsweek, triggered alarm and finger-pointing in the Democratic camp, and a reshuffle in the Kerry team. But other surveys have since suggested the Bush convention \"bounce\" was much smaller and the contest remains a close one. </p> <p>The Zogby poll says the president has made up ground in many of the 20 battleground states, but Mr Kerry retains a slim lead in most of them - enough to give him a majority in the electoral college, if the vote was held now. </p> <p>The college, which chooses the president, is made up of 538 delegates drawn from the 50 states and Washington DC, according to population. Assigning electors according to the way each state is leaning now, the Zogby poll gives Mr Kerry a lead of 273 to 222, down from the past two months, but a significant edge all the same. </p> <p>\"There's no doubt that Bush got a bounce ... but no way is he up 11 points,\" John Zogby, the head of Zogby International, said yesterday. </p> <p>Newsweek showed the Mr Bush with an 11 percentage point lead among registered voters, while Time gave him a nine-point lead. But another survey by Gallup, CNN and USA Today showed only a one-point advantage. </p> <p>The confusion may reflect the volatility that follows the impassioned speeches and allegations made at conventions. It may also be explained by different surveying methods, and some of it is simply a result of polls being taken over the Labour Day holiday weekend, when many Americans are away from home. </p> <p>Charlie Cook, an experienced US election analyst, said: \"To be dependent upon getting a representative sample over a holiday weekend is enough to make any pollster wince. Polling conducted this week, after people are back from Labour Day and had a chance to digest the Republican convention, will be a far better test.\" </p> <p>US electoral history suggests that leads established at party conventions can often dissipate in the last two frenetic months of the campaign. Al Gore had a double-digit lead over Mr Bush after the Labour day weekend in 2000, but lost it after lacklustre performances in the three presidential debates. </p> <p>Mr Bush, who had not previously shown much aptitude for public speaking, surprised many doubters by avoiding serious mistakes and scoring a few points in the debates. Mr Kerry must hope to do better than his Democratic predecessor in knocking his opponent off balance. </p> <p>The Zogby results suggest the president's emphasis on his role as a wartime leader at the New York convention helped him reassert control in traditionally conservative southern states where Mr Kerry had been making headway before August, such as North Carolina, Tennessee, and Virginia. But elsewhere the Democratic contender is holding on, and in some states - Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico and Washington - has even strengthened his position since the attacks made on his fitness to be America's commander-in-chief. </p> <p>Matthew Dowd and Doug Sosnik, top strategists in the Bush and Kerry camps respectively, both predict that as the race nears the November 2 finishing line, money and manpower will increasingly focus on three large swing states, Florida, Pennsylvania and Ohio, which have a combined total of 68 electoral college votes. </p> <p>Both candidates have been spending more and more time campaigning there. Mr Bush is due to inspect storm damage in Florida today before heading to Pennsylvania. Mr Kerry will be in Cincinnati, Ohio. </p> <p>Both Mr Dowd and Mr Sosnik forecast that whoever wins two of the three big battlegrounds will probably be the next president. </p> <p>At present, according to Zogby, Mr Bush is ahead in Ohio by 11 points. Mr Kerry has a smaller edge of three points in Pennsylvania. Florida is a dead heat, as it has been for much of the year. By that reckoning, this election could be fought and won once more in the Sunshine State, currently being pummelled by hurricanes, just as it was four years ago.</p>",
  "First the bad news. Bill Clinton has unexpectedly been diagnosed with a serious heart condition, George Bush has bounded to an 11-point post-convention lead over John Kerry in Newsweek and Time polls, and there is an instant sense among the transatlantic political class that the president will now win re-election to the White House. But be careful. Not so fast. Don't panic. For now here is the good news. Mr Clinton's bypass operation was successful, the Come-Back Kid has passed his election-winning advice to Mr Kerry, and Mr Kerry has decided to follow it. <p>There are still 55 days to go in the 2004 US presidential election. It was a tight race before last week's Republican convention, and it remains a tight race after it. Polls taken over a holiday weekend need to be read with caution. In any case, this contest will remain tight right down to the wire. What is more, it will be won and lost in the dozen battleground states that tip the electoral college. And here the news is better for Mr Kerry. The new Zogby International poll in the key states shows much less of a post-convention \"Bush bounce\" than the instant national polls. On the basis of these state-by-state surveys, Mr Kerry remains on course to capture the presidency. Tot up the electoral college votes based on the state-by-state polls, award Mr Bush all of the current dead-heat races, and Mr Kerry still takes the White House by 273-265. </p> <p>That is not a prediction. The result will probably be very different (though it is likely to be close). The point, though, is that anyone who says with certainty that either Mr Bush or Mr Kerry will win does not know what they are talking about. The 2004 election is still in play. The outcome is in doubt. The lead will shift back and forth and take different directions in different states. Given the tightness of the race, this year's presidential debates, starting in three weeks, are likely to be even more important than usual. Key economic indicators will also be closely watched. Unknowable events, in the US and elsewhere, not least Iraq, will have an impact that no one can accurately foretell. Yes, Mr Bush has momentum. He is gaining in the state-by-state polls as well as in the broader-brush national surveys. And yes, Mr Kerry is slipping back. But bear in mind that Mr Kerry is a good debater. And he has a track record as a good finisher. It ain't over yet. </p> <p>But Mr Kerry clearly needs to regain the initiative from his resurgent opponent. How does he do that? First, he does not need to panic. But, second, he needs both to broaden and to sharpen his message. Mr Kerry was right, not wrong, to promote his own credibility as someone who can fight the terrorist threat, and it may even be that he was tactically clever to draw the attack ads against his Vietnam experience into the open early in the campaign. But the election will not be won in Vietnam. It may not even be won in Iraq, although Mr Kerry could do more there. It will be won and lost on whether Americans feel confident that things will get better under Mr Kerry or Mr Bush. The president was smart to spend a lot of his convention speech talking about domestic programmes; Mr Kerry should have done the same in his speech a month previously - but didn't. </p> <p>Beware of believing that all Mr Kerry has to do is hand over his campaign to the Clintonites and all will be well. And be careful of assuming that Mr Clinton is seen as such a pivotal figure in the US as he is here. Even so, Mr Clinton's message from his hospital bed to Mr Kerry was the right one. These are not easy times for many Americans. Tell the voters how and why they will be more prosperous, better cared for and more secure under a Kerry presidency. Concentrate on the economy, health care and the budget deficit. Mr Kerry has eight weeks to turn the 2004 election in his favour. It will not be easy. But it is certainly achievable.</p>",
  "The spectacle of George Carey in his post-archiepiscopal retirement has not been an edifying one. His autobiographical indiscretions about private meetings with Mrs Parker Bowles combined a vulgar taste for self-publicity and a creepily adoring attitude to royalism. He reproduced cliches about Princess Diana's \"manipulative\" attitudes and ignored her embrace of the outcast - deeds that showed she had more practical Christianity in her little finger than in some expansive episcopal girths. <p>His forays into international affairs have been equally crass. Carey's rebuke of Islamic leaders for failing to condemn terrorism was surprisingly ill-informed for one who had favoured dialogue. It was, perhaps, Islam's scriptural simplicities that led him once to look so kindly on it. For Carey's evangelical Christianity, with its uncritical attitude to the Bible, has something in common with the Qur'an-reverence of the more obscurantist mullah. </p> <p>But his attack on Islam revealed evangelicalism as an aspect of the west's politics. It is self-satisfied, prosperously middle-class and monopolises Christianity as a convenient ratification of its own life choices. Anything that threatens such security has to be anathematised. </p> <p>Next week Carey travels to the US to confirm several hundred adults and children from parishes in Virginia that have rejected the authority of their own bishop, Peter Lee, on account of his support for Gene Robinson, American Episcopalianism's first openly gay bishop. Carey is at all times a deliberate character with an acute sense of his own significance. Comparatively early retirement and nostalgia for high office have played their role in his decision to put himself about so vigorously. No recent archbishop of Canterbury displayed quite so obvious a love of position and so passionate an attachment to the privileges of the Anglican establishment. Every gig he gets is a chance to trail clouds of archiepiscopal glory. </p> <p>Never keen on his successor, Carey is as blunt as the present archbishop is opaque. Now he seems determined to give a voice to the church within the church, a movement that rejects not only liberal tolerance but also the church authority that once gave him a career. For the striking thing about the gay-phobic evangelicals of the US and Britain is that they are not really Episcopalians. They reserve the right to follow bishops they approve of and then to withdraw diocesan subscriptions if the local bishop fails to toe their line. They are, in effect, Congregationalists running their own churches and selecting their own theology. </p> <p>But administrative confusions of this kind pale before deeper hypocrisies. Anglican evangelicals have as selective an attitude towards the Bible as any other Christians. Many evangelical priests will now remarry divorced persons, the overwhelming majority accept women priests, and they all accept the validity of charging interest on loans: all developments inconceivable on a literalist view of biblical authority - while Old Testament dietary rules are happily ignored when evangelicals tuck in. </p> <p>On gay issues, evangelicals parrot St Paul's throwaway remarks, whose origins lie in the tentmaker's outsider attitude to classical culture. However, they are deaf to the real thrust of Paul's theology of grace, which takes the heart and mindbeyond self-satisfied assurances of legalistic observance. Paul would recognise the Virginians for what they are - Pharisees using Christianity to ratify secular family values. </p> <p>Carey's intervention assumes extra importance with the publication this week of the report of the archbishop's special commission set up in the wake of that Robinson consecration. The report will threaten the liberal-inspired American church with expulsion from the Anglican communion if its leaders fail to repent in time. In the meantime, bishops and clergy who stick by their truth will be excluded from Anglican \"decision making\". So, no invites to Lambeth Palace garden parties for them. And this exclusionist policy is directly attributable to the Anglican Communion Institute, an evangelical thinktank sponsored by one George Carey. </p> <p>Carey's actions presage years of dreary dissidence about \"the church in danger\". It may be that even this former archbishop, a figure not given to much introspection, knows he has to make up for time lost in the 90s. That, famously, was to be a decade of evangelism - part of Carey's proclaimed mission, but whose result was a collapse in communicants and increasing numbers of those appalled by the sight of parsons quarrelling about the correct policy on penises. As that serious religious thinker, Derek Jarman, said when contemplating Anglicanism with Carey on top: \"This is where shit gets you.\" </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> <a href=\"mailto:taliesin.hywel@virgin.net\">taliesin.hywel@virgin.net</a></p>",
  "Welcome to the Backbencher, Guardian Unlimited's weekly insider's guide to Westminster. <p>In this week's Backbencher: Andrew's liberation, Alan's temptation and Alex's resurrection</p> <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; FROM WESTMINSTER</p> <p>The Backbencher buttonholed Guardian political editor Michael White after the first prime minister's questions since the summer recess.</p> <p>\"Everyone's excited about the coming reshuffle - politicians love nothing more than who's up, who's down, who's in, who's out, who's doing what to whom and why. And of course Michael Howard attempted - not very successfully - to stick it on the PM. He concentrated on all this 'anonymous, poisonous briefing' we've been reading about in the papers and said that Andrew Smith, the outgoing work and pensions secretary; Nick Brown, the former chief whip and well-known Gordon Brown supporter; and Ian McCartney, the party chairman, had all been criticising Mr Blair's style. </p> <p>\"Mr Blair said 'isn't it pathetic, all he wants to talk about is trivia, not about substance. Why doesn't he want to talk about his pensions policy or his new student loans policy? I'll tell you why - they're no good!' Perhaps I'm biased, but I thought Mr Blair got much the better of him. </p> <p>\"Mr Howard said Labour had reneged on its promise to provide free higher education, and the Tories were going to restore it. But that claim lasted about a minute and a half, because Mr Blair pointed out, in his inconvenient way, that there's at least a \u00a3500m gap in the new Tory spending plans, they're going to reduce the level of support, and in any case student loans would not be charged at the current 3.5% but at 8%.</p> <p>\"Even Charles Kennedy had a go at the prime minister over women being discriminated against in the pension system, and Mr Blair counterattacked criticising the Lib Dem plans to save \u00a38bn by scrapping the DTI. 'What you don't seem to realise,' he said, 'is that \u00a38bn isn't the DTI budget but all the budgets related to it, including scientific research'. So, as Labour MPs tittered cruelly, Mr Blair said it was time for a serious debate about properly costed savings if we're going to talk about pensions. Mr Kennedy fought back as best he could, but again, despite all his difficulties, Mr Blair and his eager team are still ahead of most of the policy issues they tackle.</p> <p>\"So, what of the reshuffle? Mr Blair wants it all to be completed on one day. But it's a bit like buying and selling a house - you have to get all the dominoes lined up in the right way along the chain before you can announce things, because if one minister refuses that puts everything out of kilter. Or, as Andrew Smith showed on Monday, if you resign suddenly the prime minister has to redo all his calculations.</p> <p>\"If Mr Blair announces his reshuffle today, then I infer from that that maybe Alan Milburn has decided it isn't worth it if he isn't going to get Ian McCartney's job. He might decide he would prefer to spend even more time with his family than get into a firefight with Gordon Brown.\"</p> <p> &gt;&gt;&gt; LAST WEEK'S COMPETITION</p> <p>The Backbencher asked readers what - according to Miss America 2004 - the \"W\" in Dubya stands for.</p> <p>\"Sorry, I can't handle this: the man's a complete walker,\" writes Eddie Dougall.

She certainly did, James, and in the spirit of cooperation the Backbencher will post the book just as soon as you let her know your address.

She finds her own remarkably tedious in large doses. Perhaps Mr Milburn found he feels the same.

Will the government's formerly most boring minister (step forward Alun Michael, now's your chance) find more time to speak in the Commons? Will he want to stop for a friendly chat when MPs pass him in the corridor? And worse, will the dalek-voiced Mr Smith try and corner them in the Stranger's bar?</p> <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; OUR FRIEND IN THE NORTH</p> <p>The Backbencher advises her parliamentary friends to look on the bright side. Mr Smith's exit may ensure the much-anticipated return of the deliciously caddish <a href=\"http://alanmilburn.co.uk/diary/picture.cfm\">Alan Milburn</a> to frontline politics. She has missed his Geordie charm and his way with the ladies - and chides those who have questioned his commitment to family life. With a job-share in the offing with Labour's pint-size party chairman, Ian McCartney, he won't be far from the patter of tiny feet. </p> <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; SALMOND LEAPS AGAIN</p> <p>Return or no return, Mr Milburn still isn't Westminster's comeback kid. That honour goes to the Scottish National party's new leader, Alex Salmond, who only resigned from the post four years ago. Celebrating the double, he promised to start campaigning for the 2007 Scottish election straight away. True to his word, the SNP media machine has been churning out press releases in earnest. The latest congratulates Scottish art-rockers Franz Ferdinand for their Mercury music prize win and backs the Scottish football team in the World Cup qualifiers. The Backbencher is relieved that wee Alex hasn't lost his populist touch.</p> <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; LIKE IT OR LEMBIT</p> <p>Those curious about why loveable Lembit Opik's bid to become president of the Liberal Democrats went the way of the meteorites - it crashed to earth - need only examine his campaign <a href=\"http://dilatedsky.bitpusher.co.uk/sherry/liberal/say.htm\">website</a>.

  "<p>The US economy has come out of its recent soft patch and regained some momentum, the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, said today.</p> <p>In upbeat testimony before the House of Representatives budget committee, the world's most powerful central banker said consumer spending and housing starts had rebounded in July and that business investment remained on a solid upward trend - although he acknowledged that early readings on retail sales in August were mixed. </p> <p>\"The most recent data suggest that, on the whole, the expansion has regained some traction,\" Mr Greenspan said, in testimony that was sure to be closely followed by the White House and the Democratic presidential hopeful, John Kerry.</p> <p>With an economic record that gives him little to boast about, President George Bush has mentioned the economy as little as possible in his speeches. Mr Kerry, on the other hand, has begun to focus on bread and butter issues on the advice of Bill Clinton, who won the presidency on the mantra: \"It's the economy, stupid.\"</p> <p>Mr Greenspan's positive assessment will be welcomed by Mr Bush amid debate about whether the US economy was losing steam just a couple of months ahead of November's presidential vote. Private economists largely agree with Mr Greenspan that the economy has picked up, although they thought he hedged his bets today. </p> <p>\"Greenspan has edged away from the 'soft-patch' story and taken a step towards the 'regaining of traction' theme, but has put in enough hedges, perhaps reflecting his lack of conviction,\" said Ian Morris, an economist with HSBC. </p> <p>Still, last week there was encouraging news on the jobs front for the Republicans. The US labour department reported last Friday that non-farm payrolls - among the most watched of US economic indicators - rose 144,000, about in line with economists' forecasts. Figures for the previous two months were revised up, from 32,000 to 73,000 for July and to 96,000 from 78,000 in June. The unemployment rate fell to 5.4% from 5.5% in July, the lowest in almost three years. </p> <p>On a more negative note for the White House, Mr Greenspan voiced implicit criticism of Mr Bush's handling of the budget, which has ballooned into an enormous deficit, from a surplus under the Clinton presidency. The Congressional Budget Office yesterday said for the year to September 30 2004 the deficit would set a new record of $422bn (\u00a3236.5bn) . </p> <p>Mr Greenspan said the record deficit would likely narrow in the year ahead but that the long-term outlook was worrying. </p> <p>\"With the economy continuing to improve, the deficit is more likely to decline than to increase in the year ahead,\" he said. \"Nonetheless, the prospects for the federal budget over the longer term remain troubling.\" </p> <p>The Fed chairman reiterated his concerns about the sustainability of social security (state pensions) and Medicare (health insurance for elderly) programmes. Mr Greenspan avoided policy prescriptions to address the fiscal strains that the retirement of the baby-boom generation would create, but again urged discipline in the budget process. </p> <p>\"Re-establishing an effective procedural framework for budgetary decision making should be a high priority. But it is only a start,\" Mr Greenspan said. \"As we prepare for the retirement of the baby-boom generation and confront the implications of soaring expenditures for medical care, a major effort by policymakers to set priorities for tax and spending programs and to start making tradeoffs is long overdue.\"</p>",
  "The issue of pensions dominated the first prime ministers' questions since the summer recess today, as Tony Blair ridiculed a new Liberal Democrat policy to raise the state pension to over \u00a3100 a week and a thousand pensioners lobbied MPs outside parliament. <p>As the three main party leaders clashed for the first time since the holidays, the prime minister took issue with the Lib Dems - whose policy closely echoes the new <a href=\"http://www.pensionersmanifesto.co.uk\" target=\"_new\">\"pensioners' manifesto\"</a> launched by the National Pensioners Convention (NPC) today - over how they would fund the triple-figure weekly pension payments and a restore the link with average earnings.</p> <p>Charles Kennedy called for action to end \"blatant discrimination\" which sees the average woman receive just \u00a351 a week in basic state pension and said that two-fifths of pensioners - two million people - were not receiving the means-tested benefits to which they are entitled. </p> <p>However, Mr Blair appeared to score a decisive victory over the Lib Dems, saying the \u00a32.7bn savings to pay for the pensions increase from abolishing the Department of Trade and Industry in fact represented scrapping two-thirds of the state support for science and cutting all of its regional assistance. </p> <p>Michael Howard, meanwhile, rhetorically wondered who \"could possibly have been responsible\" for the three months of \"poison and briefing\" that friends of the resigned pensions secretary Andrew Smith has complained of.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a thousand pensioners are were lobbying MPs outside parliament over Britain's provision for the elderly, the NPC was launching its manifesto for pensioners' rights and the Pensioners' Voice organisation was holding its 65th annual conference in Weston-super-Mare.</p> <p>With Mr Blair still weighing up who will receive the vital pensions portfolio, Rodney Bickerstaffe, the NPC president - and former general secretary of the public sector union Unison - called on the prime minister to ensure that whoever got the job would abolish means-testing for pensioners.</p> <p>As his organisation prepared to lobby MPs at Westminster, he told Guardian Unlimited: \"Means-testing is unfair and unnecessary in the fourth richest economy in the world. I want to know who in government is driving the means-testing agenda.\"</p> <p>Asked who he would like to see as the new work and pensions secretary, he joked: \"Whoever agrees with me the most!\" However, he said the NPC could take some credit for forcing the pensions issue, with both the Lib Dems and, to a lesser extent, the Tories now committed to restoring the pensions' rise link with average earnings.</p> <p>He said: \"The Tories have pledged to maintain the link for at least four years - and the Lib Dems yesterday met the NPC's demand for a \u00a3100-a-week basic state pension - because of public concern at the pensions crisis and pension income and future income. </p> <p>\"We have forced everyone to think again.\"</p> <p><b>Power of the grey vote</b></p> <p>With up to 1,500 of the NPC's 1.3m members in Parliament Square today Mr Bickerstaffe, who refused a knighthood from the Labour government, claimed that gathering 5,000 to 6,000 pensioners \"would not have been a problem\" but said today's lobby was about speaking to MPs individually, not numbers.</p> <p>The event is part of a year-long campaign being organised by the NPC to wield the power of the \"grey vote\" in the run-up to a general election, and the creation of a pensioners' manifesto.</p> <p> It hopes to lobby between 100 and 200 MPs today to gain their support for the manifesto, and plans to speak to every candidate standing in the general election, which is widely expected to take place next year. </p> <p>Candidates' responses to the manifesto will be published by groups in their constituency to help pensioners there decide how to cast their vote. Proposals in the NPC manifesto include: </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Raising the basic state pension to the guaranteed level of the pension credit of \u00a3105.45 a week for all pensioners and increasing it in line with average earnings each year</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Giving all people of pensionable age a free annual health check</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Introducing good quality and affordable home care services to enable people to remain in their own homes for longer</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> All long-term care and accommodation to be provided free</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Council tax to be abolished and replaced with a fairer system based on government grants and increased localised business rates and income tax </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> The introduction of a nationwide travel scheme enabling pensioners and disabled people to use all buses, coaches, trains, ferries and tubes free of charge </p> <p>Although many, if not all, of those demands closely mirror new Lib Dem policy, Mr Bickerstaffe reiterated that the NPC was non-partisan and pointed out that the question was \"who was in power\".</p> <p>\"The manifesto could chime with the Socialist Workers party or the Socialist Alliance too, but it needs to be implemented,\" he said.</p> <p><b>Current entitlements</b></p> <p>Speaking ahead of the lobby today, the pensions minister Malcolm Wicks defended Labour policy on pensions. </p> <p>He told GMTV the guaranteed pension level was \u00a3105 for a single pensioner and more for a couple with people also possibly eligible for help with rent and council tax. </p> <p>He said: \"If people have not got that second pension, the occupational pension, or the savings, they are guaranteed that \u00a3105. </p> <p>\"The difficulty here ... is do you use the extra money that you are spending - and this Labour government is spending \u00a310bn each and every year more than we were when we came to power in 1997 - by spreading it relatively thinly so all pensioners gain or do you try to focus extra help on the poorest who tend to be the most elderly?\" </p> <p>He insisted it was fair to help the poorest pensioners. </p> <p><b>Pensioner conference</b></p> <p>Meanwhile, away from Westminster, delegates from across the country will meet in Weston-super-Mare for the annual conference of the pressure group Pensioners' Voice today. </p> <p>Topics for debate will be private pension rights, proposed increases to council tax, and MRSA \"superbug\" in hospitals. </p> <p>Pensioners' Voice national vice-president Charles Connell said: \"For 65 years this federation, with branches spread from Dover to Plymouth, Bristol to Darlington and from south Wales to Glasgow has fought on behalf of pensioners and their rights. </p> <p>\"Still, the most important promise that pensioners should share in the rising prosperity of the nation is being glossed over. </p> <p>\"All that New Labour offers pensioners is the outrageously complicated means-tested pension credit. </p> <p>\"Private pensions are in crisis, council tax bills soar and now we are hearing of rising power and water bills. </p> <p>\"Pensioners are bullied into giving up their pension books and have little confidence in the computerised system that is now replacing them.\" </p> <p>Delegates at the conference will hear 14 motions relating to pensioners' rights including the low take up of means-tested benefits and the closure of post offices.</p>",
  "<p>Students today labelled Tory plans to charge commercial rates on loans \"abhorrent\", as university bosses gave them a cautious welcome.</p> <p>The president of the National Union of Students (NUS), Kat Fletcher, expressed \"grave concerns\" over the plans, which would see tuition fees dropped and replaced with a commercial rate of interest on student loans of up to 8%. She immediately sought to distance the union from the Conservative party after sharing an uneasy alliance since it announced it would abolish fees. </p> <p>\"Though the Tories stood by the NUS in our battle over tuition fees, we now recognise that their promises for a fairer funding situation for higher education were merely rhetoric. It is naive for the Tories to believe that this will win the student vote in the run-up to the general election. </p> <p>\"Such proposals will only serve to burden those already severely in debt with more debt over a period of time, marking a regressive response to the funding crisis in higher education.\"</p> <p>However, Universities UK (UUK), which represents university vice-chancellors, said the plan recognised its concerns over getting more money into universities. UUK has vigorously supported the government's plans for top-up fees.</p> <p>Its president, Ivor Crewe, said members had been consulted over the plans. \"We look forward to discussing the detail with the Conservative team, particularly with regard to the voucher scheme. One of our top priorities will be to ensure a commitment to maintaining the unit of funding per student.\"</p> <p>The fully-costed details of the plans are expected to emerge later today, but speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme this morning the shadow education secretary, Tim Collins, claimed the plans would raise as much money for the universities as the government's plans for top-up fees, but students would be better off. </p> <p>At present, all students are able to take out student loans of up to \u00a33,695. They start repaying once they earn more than \u00a310,000 at the rate of 9p on every pound earned above this threshold - plus an inflation-only interest rate. </p> <p>Under the proposals being released today students would be charged 2% above the bank base rate to a maximum of 8%. The plans would help dissuade students from taking out expensive credit cards, Mr Collins said. </p> <p>Universities, rather than the treasury and the government-owned student loans company, would control the loans and would be able to borrow against future earnings to raise money now. And they would honour the government's plans to introduce a \u00a31,500 grant for the least well off from September 2006.</p> <p>Professor Nicholas Barr, the original architect of the government's top-up fees plans, said: \"The Conservative proposals unambiguously help students from better-off backgrounds (who no longer have to pay fees) and harm students from poorer backgrounds, who will be hurt by the higher interest rate.</p> <p>\"This policy direction is problematical in two ways: it is deeply regressive, benefiting merchant bankers at the expense of nurses and teachers; and, by impeding access, it risks losing the talent of bright people from poorer backgrounds. It is good policy if the aim is to curry favour with the middle classes, but has no other redeeming features.</p> <p>Phil Willis the Liberal Democrat education spokesperson, said: \"Michael Howard is now showing his true colours. Under his plans only the wealthy should apply to universities. </p> <p>\"Tory policies will see poorer students being priced out of universities by huge hikes in the cost of student loans. </p> <p>\"By introducing commercial interest rates poorer students will end up with astronomic levels of debt and many will be put off going to university all together.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Conservative party will today promise to stick to its plans to abolish top-up fees but make students pay commercial rates of interest on their student loans, should they win the next general election.</p> <p>The fully-costed details of the plans are expected later, but speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme this morning the shadow education secretary, Tim Collins, claimed the plans would raise as much money for the universities as the government's plans for top-up fees, but leave students better off.</p> <p>The higher education minister, Alan Johnson, however, called the plans \"massively unfair\", while the Liberal Democrats' Phil Willis said they would see \"poorer students being priced out of university\".</p> <p>Under the plans, from the September after the Tories won a general election students would not have to pay any university fees but instead a commercial rate of interest on their student maintenance loans.</p> <p>At present, all students are able to take out student loans of up to \u00a33,695. They start repaying once they earn more than \u00a310,000 at the rate of 9p on every pound earned above this threshold - plus an inflation-only interest rate. </p> <p>Under the proposals being released today students would be charged 2% above the bank base rate, to a maximum of 8%. The plans would help dissuade students from taking out expensive credit cards, Mr Collins said.</p> <p>Universities, rather than the Treasury and the government-owned student loans company, would control the loans and would be able to borrow against future earnings to raise money now.</p> <p>The Tories would also honour the government's plans to introduce a \u00a31,500 grant for the least well-off from September 2006, but all other students would be treated the same, with the abolition of means-testing.</p> <p>Mr Collins said the plans would leave the public purse better-off as the subsidy for the interest free loans, and the payment of tuition fees for the least wealthy, would be lifted.</p> <p>Universities would get more money than under the government's plans, he said: \"Not only do they get the same amount as the government plans but very substantial new sums. Up to \u00a33bn over the first three years. And \u00a320bn over 20 years.\"</p> <p>And students would benefit considerably too, he claimed. The average debt would be \u00a310,000 - compared with an expected average of \u00a319,000 once top-up fees are introduced.</p> <p>He defended the plans to introduce commercial levels of debts, saying they would still be lower than some of the rates students pay on credit cards. \"Many students have additional debts which they often take out at much higher rates of interest. Overall, students will be considerably better-off under our plans compared with the government's.\"</p> <p>Asked whether people who opted for lower-paying jobs in the public sector would pay back more as it takes them longer and they accrue more interest on their loans, he said: \"It's not true that someone who works in a public sector job will be worse off. NHS clinical researchers take 19 years to repay their debt; under our plans they pay it off earlier and save money.\"</p> <p>However, Mr Johnson, the higher education minister tipped for promotion to the cabinet in this week's reshuffle, condemned the Tory plans as \"massively unfair\".</p> <p>\"They would mean that repayment of student loans would not be based in any way on the ability to pay,\" he said. \"Repayment would not be through the tax system and so would be massively unfair and expensive for the universities to administer. </p> <p>\"And, most importantly of all, universities would simply not get the money they need for raising the quality of their courses.\" </p> <p>The Liberal Democrats' education spokesman, Mr Willis, also criticised the Tory proposals, saying they would see \"poorer students being priced out of universities\".</p> <p>\"By introducing commercial interest rates poor students will end up with astronomic levels of debt and many will be put off going to university altogether,\" he added.</p> <p>Further details were expected to emerge with the full publication of the plans later today.</p> <p>A year and a half ago the Conservatives made the surprise announcement that they planned to abolish fees, but they have has since been reviewing the policy in an admission that their first version of the plans would leave universities short of cash.</p> <p>EducationGuardian.co.uk first confirmed the Tory plans to up the rates of interest on student loans last month. The plan was defended then by Paul Bristow, the chairman of young Tories' group Conservative Future. \"I think students will be delighted by this,\" he said. \"This is the best possible deal students will get. They pay loans back in the end but the crippling up-front fee is not there [in the Tory policy] any longer.\" </p> <p>However, the National Union of Students condemned the plans. The vice-president of the NUS, Hannah Essex, said: \"Any increase in the interest rate of student loan repayments would prolong the lifespan of debt and punish those who need to take out the maximum loan, which is often students from low-income backgrounds.\"</p>",
  "To Sen. Zell Miller: <p>You seem to have forgotten that loyal Democrats elected you as mayor [of Young Harris] and as state senator. Loyal Democrats, including members of my family and me, elected you as state senator, lieutenant governor and governor. It was a loyal Democrat, Lester Maddox, who assigned you to high positions in the state government when you were out of office. It was a loyal Democrat, Roy Barnes, who appointed you as U.S. senator when you were out of office. By your historically unprecedented disloyalty, you have betrayed our trust. </p> <p>Great Georgia Democrats who served in the past, including Walter George, Richard Russell, Herman Talmadge and Sam Nunn, disagreed strongly with the policies of Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, John Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson and me, but they remained loyal to the party in which they gained their public office. Other Democrats, because of philosophical differences or the race issue, like Bo Callaway and Strom Thurmond, at least had the decency to become Republicans.</p> <p>Everyone knows that you were chosen to speak at the Republican National Convention because of your being a \"Democrat,\" and it's quite possible that your rabid speech damaged our party and paid the GOP some transient dividends. </p> <p>Perhaps more troublesome of all is seeing you adopt an established and very effective Republican campaign technique of destroying the character of opponents by wild and false allegations. The Bush campaign's personal attacks on the character of John McCain in South Carolina in 2000 was a vivid example. The claim that war hero Max Cleland was a disloyal American and an ally of Osama bin Laden should have given you pause, but you have joined in this ploy by your bizarre claims that another war hero, John Kerry, would not defend the security of our nation except with spitballs. (This is the same man whom you described previously as \"one of this nation's authentic heroes, one of this party's best-known and greatest leaders - and a good friend.\") </p> <p>I, myself, served in the Navy from 1942 to 1953, and, as president, greatly strengthened our military forces and protected our nation and its interests in every way. I don't believe this warrants your referring to me as a pacifist. </p> <p>Zell, I have known you for 42 years and have, in the past, respected you as a trustworthy political leader and a personal friend. But now, there are many of us loyal Democrats who feel uncomfortable in seeing that you have chosen the rich over the poor, unilateral pre-emptive war over a strong nation united with others for peace, lies and obfuscation over the truth, and the political technique of personal character assassination as a way to win elections or to garner a few moments of applause. These are not the characteristics of great Democrats whose legacy you and I have inherited. </p> <p>Sincerely, and with deepest regrets, </p> <p>Jimmy Carter</p>",
  "She's famous for her scandalous portraits of iconic figures, and her victims know she has no interest in being kind to the powerful. <p>So George Bush has good reason to feel queasy about the latest work of Kitty Kelley, the muckraking celebrity biographer, who has turned her poisoned pen on America's pre-eminent political family. </p> <p>The Family: The Real Story of the Bush Dynasty is not scheduled for publication for another week, but details of its revelations are already circulating on US websites and in gossip columns - much to the delight of Democrats and the chagrin of Republicans. </p> <p>They include claims that Mr Bush snorted cocaine at the Camp David retreat when his father was president, and may have helped a girlfriend obtain an abortion. </p> <p>Though she is not regarded as a serious biographer by any stretch, Kelley is undeniably a bestseller. The initial print run for the book is 600,000 copies, and anticipation about its contents sent a frisson through Republicans at last week's convention. </p> <p>And, after a highly effective campaign to smear the wartime record of John Kerry, the Kelley biography is seen as an occasion for Democrats to sling some mud of their own against a Christian president who claims to stand for conservative values. </p> <p>Next week also promises a fresh examination of President Bush's activities during the Vietnam war. CBS 60 Minutes is due to broadcast an interview with a former lieutenant governor of Texas, Ben Barnes, speaking out for the first time about his shame in arranging Mr Bush's assignment to the air national guard, which spared him being sent to Vietnam. </p> <p>Kelley's publicists say her book will minutely examine Mr Bush's service record, including the so-called lost year when he transferred from Texas to Alabama, ostensibly to work on a Republican Senate campaign. </p> <p>It claims to dig behind the jealously guarded public facade of the family to reveal \"the matriarchs, the mistresses, the marriages, the divorces, the jealousies, the hypocrisies, the golden children, and the black sheep\". </p> <p>It is uncertain what effect the revelations will have on Mr Bush's re-election effort. He acknowledged his mis-spent youth during the 2000 elections - including a 1976 arrest for drunk driving - and while the bad behaviour raised doubts among conservative supporters, it did not seriously damage his campaign. </p> <p>He has admitted that alcoholism nearly cost him his marriage but claims to have turned over a new leaf in 1986 after giving up alcohol and becoming a born-again Christian. </p> <p>While some revelations will be familiar to Americans, Kelley claims the 700-page tome has extraordinary new detail. For the first time it airs allegations that Laura Bush, the first lady, might also have experimented with cocaine. </p> <p>Pre-publication leaks say Kelley had access to Sharon Bush, the ex-wife of the president's younger brother, Neil. Since their bitter divorce, Ms Bush has been eager to air her insights on the family inner circle, and was quoted yesterday as being the source of the Camp David allegations. </p> <p>Mr Bush's use of alcohol is reported in the book to have started at school and followed him to Yale, where he is first alleged to have used drugs. </p> <p>The book also claims to have circumstantial evidence that he helped a girlfriend obtain an abortion, a charge that has circulated in the past on left-leaning websites.</p> <p><b>What Kelley said about ...</b></p> <p><b> Frank Sinatra</b><br> </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> His mother was a New Jersey abortionist </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> He ate bacon and eggs from a prostitute's breasts </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> He bought $200,000 worth of furniture in cash in wrapping paper from a Las Vegas casino </p> <p><b>Nancy Reagan</b><br> </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> She is a witch who managed to trap Ronald into marrying her by getting pregnant </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> She seduced Sinatra during lunch at the White House </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> The Reagans smoked marijuana when he was governor of California </p> <p><b>The royal family</b><br> </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> The Queen Mother may have been the illegitimate daughter of a maid </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> The Queen and Princess Margaret were conceived by artificial insemination </p> <p><b>Jackie Onassis</b><br> </p> <p> <b>\u00b7</b> She had electric shock therapy, while John F Kennedy's sister had a lobotomy</p>"
