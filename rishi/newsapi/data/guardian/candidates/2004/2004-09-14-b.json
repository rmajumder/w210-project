  "Former cabinet minister Estelle Morris is to quit parliament at the next election, she announced tonight. <p>Ms Morris, who surprised the whole of Westminster two years ago by resigning as education secretary because she did not feel up to the job, will leave her Birmingham Yardley constituency at the next election.</p> <p>She is currently the government's arts minister, and tonight said that - so long as Tony Blair was willing - she would remain in that job until the general election.</p> <p>In a short statement, Ms Morris, who has been the MP for Birmingham Yardley since 1992, said she had not \"lost her enthusiasm or energy\" for politics, but was looking for a \"new challenge\".</p> <p>She entered the cabinet following the 2001 general election, replacing David Blunkett as education secretary.</p> <p>Ms Morris stepped down from this post after becoming engulfed in a string of rows relating to teaching, exams and targets - compounded by pressure from tabloid newspapers.</p> <p>She told Mr Blair at the time that she did not feel her strength was in \"strategic management of a huge department\", adding that she was \"not good at dealing with the modern media\". </p> <p>In her statement, she said: \"It has been a huge privilege to represent Yardley in parliament and I owe a debt of gratitude to my constituents and my party members for giving me that opportunity. </p> <p>\"I am tremendously proud of the achievements of the Labour government and the contribution I have been able to make in two departments of state. </p> <p>\"I have not lost my enthusiasm or energy for politics but I want a different focus and a new challenge outside the House of Commons.\" </p> <p> Mr Blair paid tribute to Ms Morris, saying: \"Estelle has been a brilliant Labour MP for Birmingham Yardley. She has, throughout her time in parliament, championed the interests of the city and her constituency with vigour and determination. </p> <p>\"I will be really sorry to see her go but I know, up to the election and beyond, she will continue to work for and support the Labour government.\"</p> <p>The home secretary, David Blunkett, with whom Ms Morris worked as a minister when he was education secretary, also paid tribute to his colleague. </p> <p>Mr Blunkett said: \"I was tremendously sorry to hear this news. </p> <p>\"Estelle has been a fine minister and a superb MP who has made a lasting contribution to raising education standards in this country. </p> <p>\"I wish her all the very best for the future.\"</p> <p>At the 2001 election she had a 2,576 majority in her constituency, one of the relatively few Labour marginals where the Liberal Democrats are in second place. They need a 4.3% swing to win next time round - highly achievable in the context of the recent 20% plus swings the party has secured at recent byelections.</p>",
  "After weeks of bracing by the Bush White House, the category 5 storm has hit: Hurricane Kitty. Bestselling author Kitty Kelley's withering portrait of the Bush dynasty, The Family, is landing in bookstores on Tuesday - more than 720,000 copies of it. And the White House is already on high alert. \"This book is fiction and deserves to be treated as such,\" snarled Republican spokeswoman Christine Iverson, as the RNC fired off an anti-Kelley talking-points memo to friendly media assets. <p>The media blowback against Kelley, author of controversial biographies of Nancy Reagan and Frank Sinatra, has already begun. On the Monday morning Today Show, host Matt Lauer showed how tough an interviewer he can be when not questioning presidents and other potentates, pressing Kelley on who she's going to vote for in November (\"Who're you voting for?\" Kelley shot back) and the timing of the book's publication, weeks before the November election (\"Why not? It's relevant,\" countered the author, who's been working on the book for four years). </p> <p>The hottest dispute sparked by the book involves the allegation that George W Bush, who claimed to be clean and sober at the time, snorted cocaine with one of his brothers at the Camp David presidential retreat when his father was president. One of Kelley's sources - and the only one on the record - was Sharon Bush, the deeply aggrieved ex-wife of W's younger brother Neil. She is now in strong denial mode, even though her own publicist, who was present at a lunch where she told Kelley the story, confirms the accuracy of Kelley's account. Nonetheless, Lauer produced the Bush divorcee after his interview with Kelley to repeat her denials. </p> <p>While the Camp David coke party is getting the headlines, Kelley's book is filled with many other tawdry stories about the Bush dynasty. Here is a family that looks \"like The Donna Reed Show, and then you see it's The Sopranos\", Kelley tells Salon. </p> <p>As Kelley tells it, the dynasty had respectable origins - in the form of family patriarch Prescott Bush, the distinguished, moderate Republican senator from Connecticut - but rapidly slid into cynical opportunism, skulduggery, and a mean-spirited sense of entitlement. The first President Bush is presented as a weak yes man, driven not by political vision but a savage preppy spirit of competition instilled in him by his whirlwind of a mother. But it is his wife, Barbara (whom the ex-wife of White House counsel C Boyden Gray calls \"bull-dyke tough\"), and their eldest son, George, who are the true pieces of work in Kelley's book, a mother and son team brimming with such spite and ambition they would give the ruthless duo in The Manchurian Candidate the shivers. </p> <p>In one of the creepier passages of the book, a family gathering from hell at Kennebunkport, Maine, Barbara is shown mercilessly baiting her dry-drunk son, then governor of Texas, as a teetotalling 'Chosen One', while he keeps pleading to skip the cocktails and put on the feed bag, and his elderly father \"drools over [TV newswoman] Paula Zahn's legs\". </p> <p>One of the major themes in Kelley's book is the family's weakness for liquor and drugs. Alcoholism, she writes, runs deeply in the family and among its victims, according to one Bush family friend, was Prescott, a \"major-league alcoholic\", who was in the habit of checking himself into his men's club and country club to go on benders. And Kelley writes that George W Bush is not the only one in the first family who enjoyed illegal substances. While a student at Southern Methodist University in the 1960s, first lady Laura Bush was known \"as a go-to girl for dime bags of marijuana\".</p> <p>But, as one of W's Yalie frat brothers tells Kelley, it's not the substance abuse in Bush's past that's disturbing, it's the \"lack of substance ... Georgie, as we called him, had absolutely no intellectual curiosity about anything. He wasn't interested in ideas or in books or causes. He didn't travel; he didn't read the newspapers; he didn't watch the news; he didn't even go to the movies. How anyone got out of Yale without developing some interest in the world besides booze and sports stuns me.\" New Yorker writer Brendan Gill recalls roaming the Kennebunkport compound one night while staying there looking for a book to read - the only title he could find was The Fart Book.</p> <p>According to Kelley, the Bushes aggressively maintain their all-American family image by scrubbing government files of embarrassing facts, stonewalling journalists, and terrorising critics. \"Some people felt that George's past did not seep out and embarrass him and his family,\" she writes of the White House's current Bush, \"because he was protected by a coterie of former CIA men with an allegiance to his father.\" An Austin, Texas political consultant named Peck Young told Kelley that when a woman claiming to have been a call girl from Midland showed up in Austin with \"intimate knowledge\" of W during his oil wildcatting days, she was approached by what she described as \"intelligence types\" and left town abruptly. According to Young, the men \"made her realise that it was better to turn tricks in Midland than to stop breathing\". </p> <p>George HW Bush and wife Barbara dismissed Bill Clinton as a pathetic hillbilly when he challenged the incumbent in 1992. But, Kelley writes, Clinton was one of the few Bush opponents who knew how to back them down. As colourful stories from Clinton's sexual past in Arkansas began to surface during the campaign, a Clinton aide began digging into the senior Bush's own robust adultery. This included, writes Kelley, two long affairs.</p> <p>The Clinton aide told Kelley: \"I took my list of Bush women to his campaign operatives. I said I knew we were vulnerable on women, but I wanted to make damn sure they knew they were vulnerable too.\" After the eruption over Clinton's mistress Gennifer Flowers died down, sexual infidelity did in fact become a moot issue in the campaign. </p> <p>While Kelley is being savagely attacked as a tabloid sleaze queen, her book is more heavily researched and documented than Bush advocates allege. On occasion, she relies on sources that are less than reliable - inserting the story Hustler publisher Larry Flynt tried to put in media play about a girlfriend's abortion that W allegedly paid for before it was legal. Kelley says she decided to put the story in her book after interviewing the two investigators Flynt had hired to track down the story. But despite her flaws, Kelley has vigorously pursued leads about the powerful American dynasty - from Bush senior's shady CIA past to W's missing National Guard records - that the rest of the media should have. </p> <p>Salon spoke with Kelley on Monday afternoon at the midtown New York offices of Doubleday, her book publisher. </p> <p>[Salon:] The Bush forces are coming after you very strongly. And now the media is too. <br> [Kitty Kelley:] Yes, they are, this is what they do, this is how they operate. It's interesting, from talking with the media today, the European media is much less intimidated than the American press. The Americans are all saying, \"well, why should we listen to you. Look at the books you've written.\" Well, excuse me, those books have stood up, I stand behind everything in those books, they've stood the test of time. And this book will too. So I see how this media spin is working, and I'm not surprised. You'd think the media would look at my book and follow up on it - all right, she says here they instituted drug testing in the National Guard at such and such time, let's call up and find out if that's true. But don't beat me up just because I've come to you with almost a thousand sources. You know, I've gone through four sets of lawyers, because I'm dealing with a sitting president. </p> <p>[S:] You've gone through this before, of course, when Frank Sinatra tried to block publication of your unauthorised biography of him. How would you compare the heat you felt from Sinatra and his crowd and what you're going through now? <br>[KK:] It's worse now, because there's more at stake. With Sinatra, you just worried about getting the bejabbers beat out of you. But with the Bushes, they work on all sorts of levels to destroy the messenger so the message can't come through. But the message is the message. The stuff I've done is solid. Did I get everything? No. And you know something, we better hurry and try to get all the information we can get - because this president is trying to lock it all up through executive order, which means you won't be able to get presidential history, because the files and everything will be locked up. </p> <p>[S:] You write that the Bushes are particularly good at cleansing anything in government files that will besmirch the family reputation. How does that work? <br> [KK:] Well, you see it on all sorts of levels, from the trivial on up. For instance, I got a copy of the Bush family tree from the Bush presidential library. And at first we just thought a couple things were left off, but it was a number of things. Mentally retarded children from one branch of the family erased. Too many divorces in one family - that doesn't fit with the family-values image, so some ex-wives simply disappear. You could say that's just an oversight or mistake here and there. But when you see a pattern as I've seen over the past years of files redacted, too many mysterious fires that destroy records, state department files simply missing, gone, National Guard files. </p> <p>[S:]You also allege that the Bushes have tried to block people from talking with you and put pressure on your publisher. <br> [KK:] Yes, imagine the former president of the United States calling your publisher. I wrote George Herbert Walker Bush requesting an interview. He always responds to letters; he's famous for it. He even responded to Bob Woodward for a book. But he didn't respond to mine - he had an assistant phone the publisher of Doubleday, Steve Rubin. Imagine that pressure. All of a sudden, your publisher is told that not only does the former president of the United States not want this book to be written, he's not going to talk, he's not going to verify anything. Most publishers would have caved at that point. And I think Bush thought it would work. </p> <p>[S:] Let's talk about Sharon Bush - she is your only on-the-record source for the Camp David cocaine story. But she's now gone public denying she ever told it to you. Why would she do that? <br>[KK:] I don't know; my guess is she's scared. She talked about everything with me that day, mostly about the breakup of her marriage, and how the Bushes don't have family values. And she said to me that the affair that Neil had that broke up her marriage was aided and abetted by his parents, Barbara and George. </p> <p>She was crying and crying and she said, \"they let him have an affair. And I called up Barbara and threw myself on her mercy and said please, please tell him to come back home.\" And I said: \"How can his mother tell him to come back to his wife?\" And she said, \"you don't understand - they'll do anything she tells them.\" But she said her mother-in-law wouldn't do that, she was cold as ice. And she cried, \"you'd think Barbara would have been more sympathetic to me, considering all the infidelities she's had to put up with.\" </p> <p>Now over that lunch Sharon and Lou told me that she was in the midst of an alimony battle, she was angry that she was only being paid $1,000 (\u00a3557) a month alimony. And they told me they thought that if they leaked the fact she was having lunch with Kitty Kelley to the press, the Bushes hate you so much, that will scare them. And it might be leverage for her in her divorce. And Lou said: \"Well, this lunch might find its way into the New York Observer.\" And in fact it came out in the Observer the next week.</p> <p>[S:] So Sharon Bush was using you to put some heat on the family to get a better divorce deal? <br>[KK:] Yes. And I understand that. And she did get a better deal. Her alimony went up to $2,500 (\u00a31,400). So that told me something else about the Bushes and how they operate. So she got a better alimony deal out of it. But then she goes on The Today Show Monday morning to say you're wrong. That takes nerve, to go on network TV to challenge a bestselling author. </p> <p>[S:] Why would she have done that? <br>[KK:] Her kids. Her kids are in touch with her grandparents and they go, \"mom, how could you, how could you?\" I think it was pressure from her kids, coming down hard from her grandparents. Absolutely. She has three kids - one who's still a minor, Ashley, one, Pierce, who just started Georgetown University and wants to be a politician, and then she's got the model, Lauren. And I think kids are the first casualty, and they didn't ask for this and just want it all to go away. They probably love their family and are just appalled at what their mother did. And Sharon was probably at a very vulnerable time, and is not quite as vulnerable now. But she got on nationwide television and denied what she said, and I have a witness. </p> <p>[S:] Why didn't you tape it? <br>[KK:] It was in a restaurant, I never tape in them. It's loud and clattery. Also I knew it would probably be a sensitive interview. I don't tape every interview, but I have a lot on tape. </p> <p>[S:] In another explosive part of your book, you tell the story of a Midland prostitute peddling embarrassing stories about George W Bush who's suddenly run out of Austin by some threatening \"intelligence types\". You name one source for that story. Do you have others? <br>[KK:] One on record, and two unnamed sources. <br>[S:] Why didn't you name them? <br>[KK:] I don't remember why in that case.<br>[S:] With a charge like that, it seems like you'd want more than one named source. I'd also want to know if the source you named, this political consultant in Austin named Peck Young, had an axe to grind, if he was a Bush hater. What made you give that story credit?<br> [KK:] Because he was impeccable, that source, I feel very comfortable with him.<br> [S:] And you believe the Bushes are capable of doing something like that - of threatening a woman who is shooting her mouth off like that? You think the family really operates that way?<br>[KK:] I know the family operates that way. I wish you could see the stuff that's on the cutting room floor, that got left out of the book. There are other people who will tell you stories like that, but they won't go on the record. And you can't blame them. And I don't know how to convince them, that it's history, that it's important. Because I can't in good conscience tell them that. But I do feel comfortable with that story. I'm surprised by the number of people who did go on the record. </p> <p>[S:] Another inflammatory passage in the book is about the girlfriend whose abortion George W Bush allegedly paid for as a young man. There again it seems like you go with one source, and it's somebody many people don't find credible - Larry Flynt. <br>[KK:] Not just him - I relied on his two detectives.<br>[S:] So you went and interviewed them as well?<br>[KK:] Yes.<br>[S:] Again, I'm trying to figure out your methodology and why your enemies come after you and say: \"She relies on shaky sources or she'll lump a variety of sources together, no matter how they vary in credibility.\"<br> [KK:] Yes, I've read that one too.<br>[S:] So how do you respond to that - say on this one in particular, this abortion story?<br>[KK:] Well, I took the public record a little further and went to the investigators and asked for their stuff, and got their stuff. I have the woman's name, address and phone number ... <br>[S:] Did you make an effort to reach her?<br>[KK:] Of course. <br>[S:] And she wouldn't talk? <br>[KK:] No. <br>[S:] But you found the two investigators credible after talking to them? <br>[KK:] Yeah, I did. </p> <p>[S:] So your method is to leave it to the reader to make up their minds? <br> [KK:] Right. And to tell you how far I went. <br> [S:] That falls short of the standards of the New York Times, say, or the Washington Post. Why do you feel it's legitimate to fall short of that standard? <br> [KK:] I don't think that falls short of the standards of the New York Times or the Washington Post in every single instance. I think that especially the Washington Post has pushed things in the past, far beyond where I would go.<br> [S:] What's an example of that? <br> [KK:] Janet Cooke. <br>[S:] Well, that was exposed as a work of fiction! <br> [KK:] Jayson Blair ... <br>[S:] But the Times and the Post were both humiliated by those scandals. <br>[KK:] And I would be too if you find something in my books that didn't stand the test of time. I honestly would. <br>[S:]So you wouldn't have put a story like that in unless you'd done enough work on your own to satisfy yourself that there was something there, that it would hold up? <br> [KK:] Right. </p> <p>[S:] What do you think W will do if he loses in November? Will he happily go back to baseball? <br> [KK:] No. You know something that I have found out from this family after four years - he doesn't plan to lose. They know how to win - no matter what. <br> [S:] What does that mean?<br> [KK:] That means these people can put the Sopranos to shame.<br>[S:] Does that mean vote stealing? <br> [KK:] That's a bit overt. But nothing will stand in the way of these people winning. Nothing. You start out looking at the Bush family like it's The Donna Reed Show and then you see it's The Sopranos. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> David Talbot is Salon's founder and editor in chief</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> This article has been provided by Salon through a special arrangement with Guardian Newspapers Limited.<br> \u00a9 Salon.com 2004 <br> Visit the Salon site at <a href=\"http://salon.com\"> salon.com</a></p>",
  "<p>The Liberal Democrats will launch a \"pre-election manifesto\" today carrying a strong message of redistribution in an attempt to swing voters behind the party in a general election expected next year. </p> <p>The mood in the Liberal Democrat camp is probably its best for decades with even some Labour MPs in safe seats admitting they fear the Liberal Democrat challenge. The 5,000 word manifesto, largely assembled by Matthew Taylor, chairman of the parliamentary party, will come in a tabloid newspaper format and is entitled Freedom, Fairness and Trust. </p> <p>The manifesto will refuse to make any concession to the party's big strategic dilemma: what direction to take as a centre-left party that needs to win Tory held seats to score an election breakthrough next year. </p> <p>It will offer 10 reasons to vote for Charles Kennedy's party. None of them are markedly new, though the Liberal Democrats are stressing the virtues of consistency and consolidation rather than innovation. </p> <p>One reason to vote Lib Dem that will not be included on the list is the proposal to switch to social insurance funding for the national health service, put forward by the party's rising star, its shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, David Laws, in his contribution to the Orange Book. However, the idea was rejected yesterday by party officials as unfair and inefficient. </p> <p>The pre-election manifesto is being published early largely because the party's strategists believe it takes six to nine months for the basic campaign teams to reach an only half-listening electorate. </p> <p>The party has long rejected the vocabulary of left and right but believes new seats can be won by appealing to disenchanted Labour voters in Tory held marginals. </p> <p>The manifesto will reiterate the commitment to fund some of its spending pledges through a 50p tax rate on income above \u00a3100,000 a year. It will also fund its pension increases by switch from rich to poor. </p> <p>Mr Taylor's work will not explicitly use the word redistribution but party leaders will not shy away from what they describe as \"the fairness agenda\". The long-held pledge to increase the basic rate of tax by 1p has been shelved for many years. </p> <p>The second major theme of the manifesto will be the loss of public trust in politics. It contains sharp criticisms of the case for war made by Tony Blair - a subject that will be taken up at repeated sessions of the party's conference next week. </p> <p>A recent Election Commission study cited Iraq as the chief reason for 60% of the public losing faith in politics. </p> <p>The third major theme of the manifesto will be decentralisation of public services, an idea first advanced two years ago but largely lost subsequently in the Iraq furore. </p> <p>The conference will be watched closely to see if there is a grassroot backlash against the pro-market, deregulatory and Eurosceptic stance increasingly adopted by the treasury team of Vince Cable and Mr Laws, MP for Yeovil. </p> <p>The proposals in the book caused consternation in sections of the party this month. </p> <p>Mr Laws, a former investment banker claimed the party had mislaid its traditional economic liberalism, allowing it to be captured by \"soggy socialism and corporatism\". </p>",
  "<p><strong>Dave Prentis</strong> Unison general secretary<br> </p> <p>\"You cannot ignore the fact that there was a degree of scepticism in the hall after seven years of trade unions having been seen as not at the heart of the Labour party. That scepticism doesn't go away with one speech but it's a welcome start. </p> <p>\"Tony's speech was a remarkable change of tone and the election must be a lot closer than even I expected. We were really pleased to hear what he said about the Warwick commitments on a public platform and it is the first time I have heard him say in public that he will end the two-tier workforce across the public services. </p> <p>\"The test will be whether or not the prime minister will be speaking in a similar vein at the Labour party conference and when he speaks to the CBI. </p> <p>\"Or was this just a speech tailored to a union audience?\" </p> <p><strong>Patrick McCourt</strong> Amicus branch secretary, Sedgefield council<br> </p> <p>\"I believe he could have gone further. There was a lot of talk about past glories but we have to deal with the issues facing us. I work in the public sector myself and I feel that there is a sense of betrayal. </p> <p>\"We need to start building bridges, getting rid of the idea that the private sector is better than the public sector and accusations that the public sector is wasteful and inefficient. I wanted more reasons to go out and persuade people to vote Labour at the election. I'm pleased though that Tony Blair made the effort to come to the TUC conference. I'm sure that's gone some way to addressing concerns that he's not interested.\" </p> <p><strong>Jane Aitchison</strong> PCS branch secretary in Leeds<br> </p> <p>\"Blair was even more sickening that I expected. He talked a lot about public services and what the government is doing when 100,000 of us face the sack not because we are not doing a good job but because a political decision has been taken to reduce the number employed. </p> <p>\"He talked about the bread and butter issues but in the public services pay is so low that thousands are entitled to benefits. He encouraged people to join a trade union but his departments are ignoring agreements and attacking trade unions.\" </p> <p><strong>Tony Woodley</strong> T&amp;G general secretary<br> </p> <p>\"We went into the speech saying we wanted to hear the prime minister say that Warwick was going to be honoured and he said it. </p> <p>\"This was a speech that sent clear signals to the union movement and the party that we have to focus on domestic issues. </p> <p>\"There is now clear blue water between us and the incompetent Conservatives.

  "The accessory of choice in the New York fashion shows of last week was, apparently, a campaign badge for one political party; or the other one, depending on your point of view. One well-regarded stylist, Mary Alice Stephenson, had a Bush/Cheney pin on her list of What Not to Wear. But it's safe to say that, were the Bush twins to turn up to any shows, with or without a dad pin, they wouldn't have been turned away. Both Bush and Kerry have made substantial use of their pretty offspring in the battle for the hearts and minds of voters who can't be bothered to read a manifesto - the Kerry daughters feature in a shoot for this month's Vogue; the Bush twins have already been there and done that. <p>Politicians will line up behind anything that might give voters a warm, fuzzy feeling. They care not for the likely political leanings of their photo-companions - they'll use babies, dogs, horticulture, fish-and-chip shops. There's an interesting comparison to be drawn here with royals, who will mainly only use children for PR purposes if they're terminally ill, and save their big photo-opportunity smiles for posing behind a beer pump in a boozer. </p> <p>Anyway, suffice it to say that Bush and Kerry will be equally delighted by fashionista support, and, lagging 10 points behind, Kerry must be glad that his daughters got the modishly lanky genes, a nice contrast to the Bush family legacy of we-look-like-people-who-enjoy-a-drink-or-two. </p> <p>But just for future fashion week/election crossovers, it might divert us to nail down which party is the most fashionable, to avoid those shaming accessory errors. Socially, Bush-era Republicanism is as unfashionable as it's possible for a political position to be. Interestingly, although fashion has a reputation as one of the flightiest and most changeable of cultural forms, it has actually stuck resolutely to a liberal social agenda. Abstinence and celibacy cults have taken hold in much of American culture; pop stars preach virginity; the largely rightwing news media reports on organisations like True Love Waits with admiration rather than bafflement. The sexual politics of the fashion industry have remained basically unchanged since the 1960s. </p> <p>Where primness pops up, it is ironic. The music and film industries tend to use nudity cynically and misogynistically. It will only be required of young women; they will then feel compelled to launch self-justifications, in the style of the evangelical Beyonc\u00e9. She defended her skimpy outfits with the remark: \"I honestly believe He [God] wants people to celebrate their bodies - as long as you don't compromise your Christianity in the process.\" </p> <p>Fashion has a much more bohemian attitude to bare flesh, admiring it equally from men and women, never grubbying itself with a side-order of 50s morality. Homophobia, likewise, is anathema to the industry. People have detected a dodgy attitude to women in the fact that models have to be so thin, but that's about no more than the line of the garment - the men have to be thin as well. All models have to look perfect for clothes. There's no malicious subtext. </p> <p>The emphasis of couture is on iconoclasm and originality, which would also be at odds with any conservative agenda. And yet, at the same time, it can be read as the most capitalistic cultural form there is. Its sine qua non is that newness is valuable for no better reason than that it is new. It relies on reckless consumption, since the very nature of the changing seasons is entirely unrelated to weather, addressing itself instead to the utterly curious idea of six-month-old items being pass\u00e9, ergo worthless. </p> <p>No other industry pursues acquisition so baldly as an end in itself, nor relies so totally on obsolescence as a given, regardless of whether the product in question is broken, or has an egg stain on it. Of all strands of culture, fashion probably has the purest and least abashed relationship with capitalism. This is what makes it so irritating when it borrows the imagery and language of civil rights and/or leftist movements in its advertising; not the fact that clothes are trivial and rights aren't, rather the fact that it panders to our basest instincts, the rotten core of us that makes us want to spend a pony on some teal boots and sod the family that could live on that for a month. </p> <p>In conclusion, then, a Bush badge is too conservative to be fashionable. A Ralph Nader badge is too hypocritical to be fashionable. Had Howard Dean won the democratic leadership, he'd be too left wing. The triangulated, socially liberal but politically centrist views of Kerry - and, should an election ever bisect London Fashion Week, Blair - dovetail perfectly with what's in vogue. Just remember, boys, no carbs at the after-show parties. </p> <p> <a href=\"mailto:zoe_williams@ntlworld.com\">zoe_williams@ntlworld.com</a></p>",
  "Normally, a giant explosion that sends a mushroom cloud high into the sky would not be counted as good news. But the explanation by the North Korean authorities that last week's mysterious blast was caused by demolition work for a hydroelectric dam is far less alarming than what was briefly feared: a test of the nuclear weapon the secretive Stalinist state is believed to be developing. Happily, there is no evidence of a nuclear detonation, though some of the experts who monitor the \"hermit kingdom\" believe that Pyongyang's official admission may conceal an accident in a closed military-industrial zone on the remote border with China. <p>Others suggest whatever happened could have been deliberate, citing the fact that it took place on September 9, the date of North Korea's foundation. The way the regime seals itself off from the outside has often encouraged rumour, as was the case with a massive train crash earlier this year. Whatever the truth, this episode is a troubling reminder of the big issue that rightly worries the entire world. Having admitted two years ago that it had the know-how to develop nuclear weapons, North Korea is still refusing to resume stalled talks with South Korea, Japan, China, Russia and the US, although it has been able to exploit reports that Seoul has experimented with plutonium enrichment. </p> <p>International aid to the victims of famine and the train disaster has not persuaded the leadership to change tack, despite internal reforms and signs it wants to improve its dire international image. Other changes may be needed to achieve a breakthrough. At the weekend, John Kerry launched an attack on George Bush for breaking with the Clinton administration's policy of direct engagement with Kim Jong-il, and then for being so preoccupied by Iraq that he has let a \"nuclear nightmare\" develop in the country he famously included in his \"axis of evil\". Americans worry about an \"October surprise\" in the run-up to presidential elections. But mountains that go bang in the night make people nervous far beyond the Washington Beltway.</p>"
