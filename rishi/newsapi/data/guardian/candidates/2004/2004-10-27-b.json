  "Vladimir Putin is not averse to voicing his opinions on other countries' elections. <p>He recently endorsed George Bush's re-election bid. And when it comes to Ukraine, there is little doubt where he stands. He favours Ukraine's prime minister, Viktor Yanukovich, a man in the authoritarian mould of the outgoing president, Leonid Kuchma. Protests of interference from supporters of the pro-western candidate, Viktor Yushchenko, have gone unheeded. </p> <p>Russia's reasons for wanting a biddable, like-minded government in Kiev are numerous. It is a strategic part of what Moscow calls its \"near abroad\" - countries once part of the Soviet Union. It is of particular importance in defence. The Black Sea fleet is still based at Sevastopol in Crimea, now part of Ukraine. </p> <p>Mr Putin's revived interest has led to heightened tensions with Georgia. Moscow's tolerance enabled the dictator of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, to tighten his grip on power this month. The prevalence of \"controlled democracy\" in the former Soviet central Asia republics matches Russia, where political pluralism is becoming a thing of the past. </p> <p>Trade and oil are other reasons why Mr Putin's embrace of Ukraine is tightening. Russia would also be dismayed were Ukraine to join Nato - it has associate status under the partnership for peace programme. Much the same goes for the EU. </p> <p>Full membership of both organisations, and closer ties to the US, are advocated by Mr Yushchenko - but he fears trends may be dragging Ukraine backwards. \"There are ominous signs of a neo-Soviet revival here,\" he wrote recently. Ukrainians \"always considered ourselves part of Europe, not just neighbours\". But following EU enlargement in May, the danger was a bipolar Europe with opposing centres in Brussels and Moscow. </p> <p>\"The dividing line established during the cold war has not totally vanished - it has only shifted a few hundred kilometres to the east,\" Mr Yushchenko said. The EU faced the prospect of \"an entire bloc of authoritarian, corrupt regimes on its borders\". </p> <p>Mr Yanukovich has a different view. \"The question of EU membership must take into consideration Ukraine's economic cooperation with Russia,\" he said. \"Our neighbour is our friend as well as our largest trading partner.\" Ukraine would further integrate with Europe \"when the time is right\". </p> <p>Like Mr Kuchma and Mr Putin, Mr Yanukovich backs media controls and a state-oriented, oligarchic business structure. Stern measures are planned should the opposition contest on the streets next Sunday's result or the expected run-off. </p> <p>The EU is watching Ukraine's polls closely, as are the Council of Europe and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Each is concerned at possible intimidation or fraud. </p> <p>Influenced by Mr Kuchma's contribution of troops to Iraq, the US's criticism is muted. But the US embassy in Kiev said it was launching a $13m (\u00a37m) programme \"to support free and fair elections\". </p> <p>According to Richard Holbrooke, the former US ambassador to the UN, tipped as secretary of state should John Kerry win: \"Good relations with Mr Putin need not be purchased at the price of democratic regression in Russia or Moscow's intimidation of Ukraine, Georgia and other former Soviet republics.\"</p>",
  "Ohio Republicans have challenged the eligibility of 25,000 registered voters, accusing Democrats of fraud. <p>Ohio's county election boards are not equipped to handle the huge caseload. It is likely to balloon further on election day, when the Republicans will dispatch more than 3,000 volunteers to thousands of polling stations around the state to challenge voter credentials. And it might result in the state being a post-election legal battleground. </p> <p>The Ohio Democratic party claims the tactic is designed to create chaos on November 2 and thereby discourage voters, especially those newly registered. The Republicans point to a review of electoral rolls which found 120,000 duplicate names, and an unknown number of ineligible voters, including a murder victim and two suspected terrorists. </p> <p>The Republican party initially issued challenges against 35,000 Ohio names, the Washington Post reported yesterday, but then withdrew some. There remain 25,000 chal lenges, each supposed to get a hearing from a county board, an impossible task. Moreover, each board consists of two Republicans and two Democrats, hugely increasing the likelihood of deadlock, and thousands of unresolved legal battles by next Tuesday. </p> <p>The John Kerry campaign has written to the boards asking them to dismiss the challenges as an \"arbitrary\" attempt to use state law to suppress the vote. </p> <p>Theodore Olsen, a former solicitor general who argued the Bush campaign's case during the 2000 recount, wrote in the New York Times that the sheer presence of thousands of lawyers at the polling stations virtually guaranteed election gridlock across the country.</p>",
  "<p>George Bush will be back in Austin, Texas, on Tuesday as America's voters pass judgment on his presidency. He is unlikely to receive the warmest of welcomes. </p> <p>Four years ago, Bush was holed up in the governor's mansion as the votes from Florida were checked and rechecked amid talk of hanging chads and political chicanery. At the time, Austin was humming. It was a symbol of America's industrial renaissance in the 1990s and a testament to the country's enduring dynamism. The city was one of the centres of the dotcom boom and jammed with internet millionaires (at least on paper). </p> <p>It is a rich town, with almost 30% of households bringing in more than $75,000 (\u00a341,000) a year, compared to the national average of just under 25%, but it has never cared much for Bush, and cares even less for him after the downturn in the hi-tech sector over the past four years. </p> <p>Geographically and culturally, it is a world apart from Cleveland, Ohio, but it has still suffered over the past four years. </p> <p>The dot bomb - as the local chamber of commerce puts it - cost around 40,000 highly paid jobs. Employment, while recovering, is still not back to the levels of 2000 and the unemployment rate is 2.4 percentage points higher at 4.4%. </p> <p>\"The city has been through a terrible period of lay-offs and downsizing,\" says Dave Porter, vice-president of economic development at the Austin Chamber of Commerce. Austin has a reputation as a liberal town. With the United States' second biggest university, it has a large student population and a laid-back, prosperous air. On the campus, as well as among the city's young entrepreneurs, the war being fought in Iraq is no more popular than was the war waged by another Texan president, Lyndon Johnson, in the 1960s. </p> <p>The other side of Johnson's legacy, however, was his Great Society programme of reforms designed to bring help to the disadvantaged. The Johnson museum and library provides a record of the vast number of education, health, social security and civil rights bills pushed through by the president as part of his \"unconditional war on poverty\". </p> <p>There are few in the city who would make the same claim for the current incumbent. </p> <p><strong> 'Corporate junta' </strong><br> </p> <p>\"This administration is a junta of major corporate interests\", says Professor James Galbraith of the University of Texas. \"You can start with oil and energy and move on through defence, the pharmaceutical sector, Rupert Murdoch, mining and logging and insurance. The fund managers are salivating over the privatisation of social security in a second Bush term. </p> <p>\"What Bush has done is carve up federal policy and pass it out to these interest groups one piece at a time. They have been feeding at the trough these last few years,\" he said. </p> <p>It is certainly not difficult to see why so many corporate executives support Bush, and why Wall Street would prefer the status quo to a Kerry win. The personal tax cuts of his first term were hugely skewed in favour of the already wealthy. Someone in the bottom 20% of wage-earners would have received an extra $2 a week this year, whereas someone in the top 1% would have pocketed an additional $800 a week. </p> <p>The big corporations have also been able to write smaller cheques to the government, in part because profits have been weaker than in the 1990s boom and in part because the government has hugely reduced their tax bills. General Electric enjoyed $9.5bn worth of tax breaks in 2001-03. In a pre-election giveaway, Bush handed out an additional $145bn corporate tax break this month. </p> <p>In an effort to reassure voters that the economy would be safe in his hands Kerry recently published a list of 200 business leaders backing him. While these include a large number of entertainment executives, the field is outnumbered by the corporate giants backing Bush. </p> <p>The irony, says Galbraith, is that the company presidents and chief executives were a lot better off four years ago because the boom on Wall Street meant their share options were a lot more valuable. When Bill Clinton left office Wall Street was booming and records show that the stock market historically has performed better under Democrats. </p> <p>\"I have never voted for them [the Republicans]\", says Michael Trafton, president of a software company, Blue Fish, based in the heart of the city's trendy 6th street. With its fish tank and drum kit so that the 15 staff can chill out, the offices are archetypal new economy. Trafton says he wants the business he started five years ago to make him rich, but has little good to say about Bush. </p> <p>\"I'm looking out for myself and I'm able to do that. I'm going to be OK but there are people out there who are not going to be OK without the government's help. We should be directing help at people who need it rather than at those who don't. It is lunacy to give tax breaks to the rich and burden future generations with the cost.\" </p> <p>The size of the budget deficit is but one of the problems that will face the winner of next week's contest. Action to reduce the amount of red ink - either through higher taxes or lower spending - would increase the risk of a softening of the economy becoming a hard landing so both Bush and Kerry will be hoping that they can grow their way out of trouble. </p> <p>On the plus side, the US has a deserved reputation for resilience and those who write it off do so at their peril. On the other hand, the economy is facing considerable headwinds, including oil prices that are eating into consumer spending, spiralling health costs that are as much of a burden to US employers as high social insurance costs are to European firms, the threat posed by China, and the debt burden of consumers. </p> <p>James Welch, a local businessman whose company, Getagadget, sells Chinese-made novelty items, identifies his main fear as further terrorism. \"After 9/11 it was really rough. Our business fell off a cliff. We didn't have a single order in 30 days. I'm worried about a further terrorist attack. It's a question of when not if.\" </p> <p>The threat posed by outsourcing varies from sector to sector. For Getagadget the savings from manufacturing in China amount to 70%, even after the hassle of doing business. Trafton says that firms looking for high-quality software prefer to do business at home rather than go to Bangalore, although increasingly he is facing competition from firms undercutting his business with overseas workers. </p> <p>China, like healthcare and social security, will rumble on as issues over the next four years. The priority, however, is to prevent the economy stalling. Galbraith says there is a strong risk that the economy will perform far less well than either Kerry or Bush is anticipating. Any boost to demand leaks out into higher imports, creating jobs in the Far East rather than the US. Meanwhile, the position of households is precarious, with interest rates rising and tax cuts spent. </p> <p>Or as Welch puts it: \"There are people in Austin who four years ago were making $60,000 a year and are now making $40,000 a year. The trouble is they still expect to live $60,000-a-year lifestyles.\" </p> <p><strong>Who's backing whom</strong></p> <p><strong> Supporters of George Bush </strong></p> <p>Bill Gates, chairman, Microsoft<br> Steve Ballmer, chief executive, Microsoft<br> Lee Scott, chief executive Wal-Mart <br> Meg Whitman, chief executive, eBay <br> Carly Fiorina, chief executive Hewlett-Packard <br> Rupert Murdoch, chairman and chief executive, News Corporation <br> Sumner Redstone, chairman and chief executive, Viacom <br> Henry Kravis, founding partner, Kohlberg, Kravis and Roberts <br> Stan O'Neal, chairman and chief executive, Merrill Lynch <br> Sam Palmisano, chairman and chief executive, IBM <br> Michael Dell, chairman, Dell <br> Craig Barrett, chief executive, Intel <br> Terry Semel, chairman and chief executive, Yahoo! <br> Philip Purcell, chief executive, Morgan Stanley <br> Brian Roberts, chairman and chief executive, Comcast<br> James Quigley, chief executive, Deloitte and Touche <br> Charles Cawley, chairman and chief executive MBNA <br> James Cayne, chairman and chief executive, Bear Stearns <br> Hank Greenberg, chairman and chief executive, American International Group <br> Thomas Hicks, chairman and chief executive, Hicks Muse Tate &amp; Furst <br></p> <p><strong> Supporters of John Kerry</strong> </p> <p>Harvey Weinstein, co-chairman Miramax </p> <p>Edgar Bronfman Jr, chairman, chief executive Warner Music </p> <p>Donna Karan, founder Donna Karan </p> <p>Barry Diller, chairman and chief executive, InterAtiveCorp <br> Peter Chernin, chief operating officer, News Corporation </p> <p>Robert Fisher, chairman, Gap </p> <p>Steve Jobs, chairman, Apple </p> <p> Warren Buffett, chairman Berkshire Hathaway <br> George Soros, chairman, Soros Fund Management </p> <p>Eric Schmidt, chief executive, Google </p> <p> Charles Gifford, chairman, Bank of America <br> Jim Clark, Netscape founder </p> <p>Jann Wenner, chairman, Wenner Media </p> <p> August Busch IV, president, Anheuser-Busch <br> Owsley Brown II, chief executive, Brown Forman </p> <p> Robert Hormats, vice-chairman, Goldman Sachs </p> <p> Thomas Lee, president, Thomas Lee Company </p> <p> Arthur Levitt, former chairman of the securities and exchange commission <br> Jeffrey Katzenberg, co-founder Dreamworks <br></p>",

Now many horrible things have been said about Michael Martin, and one of them is that he's far too nice to ministers in this government.</p> <p>\"Tony Blair was in reasonably good form; you always end these sessions realising why he's prime minister and the others aren't. He was tackled initially by Michael Howard over the seemingly straightforward question of military cuts. Last week Mr Blair said there wouldn't be cuts in the army, and apparently the chief of the defence staff said there would be, so who was right? And Mr Blair did what I'm afraid he often does. He spends five minutes avoiding saying 'yes, I made a mistake'.</p> <p>\"The PM reminded everyone listening that the Tory shadow chancellor, Oliver Letwin, is committed to freezing spending on defence - and 'freezing' usually means cuts. There is a difference of opinion on this between Mr Letwin and Nicholas Soames, the mountainous Tory defence spokesman, and Mr Blair hurled that back at Mr Howard. The Tory leader was well pleased: 'I think finally we've got an admission that the number of soldiers is going to fall', he said.</p> <p>\"Then Mr Howard asked when the prime minister was going to sign the EU constitution. 'Hang on a minute,\" replied Mr Blair, \"I want to go back to that defence question first -\" and he tried to get another blow in below the belt on that. That's when the Speaker stepped in and told the prime minister to answer the question - which he did in predictable fashion.</p> <p>\"Mr Howard kept coming back with Eurosceptical quotes from the former chief economic adviser at No 10, Derek Scott: 'Doesn't this all prove that the prime minister is being gutless on the EU?' At that point Mr Blair went for the jugular, saying 'I'll tell you what gutless is, it's not standing up to the United Kingdom Independence party but following them!' There was an enormous roar from the Labour benches - which of course outdid the Tory roars, because there are so many more of them.\"</p> <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; PRIME MINISTER'S QUESTIONS</p> <p>\"'... a true leader would stand up to Ukip,' Mr Blair says pointedly at the Tory leader. A chorus of 'ohs' follows ...\" Matthew Tempest reports on a bare-knuckled <a href=\"http://politics.theguardian.com/commons/story/0,9061,1337064,00.html\">session of PMQs</a>.</p> <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; LAST WEEK'S COMPETITION</p> <p>The Backbencher asked you why Tony is always asked about his engagements at the start of PMQs. And many readers replied.</p> <p>\"I am ashamed that I know the answer to this question. I am more ashamed that I am bothering to write an e-mail containing it,\" writes a member of an Oxford college whom we shall refer to only as Oscar. \"I am most ashamed that if I win I expect I'll read the prize eagerly from cover to cover.\" Don't be ashamed, Oscar! There's a job for you in the Commons information office.</p> <p>\"Before 1957, there would be a list of questions tabled each day by MPs, and the most relevant departmental minister on the frontbench during the generic question time would rise to answer, and then also to take supplementaries if the Speaker allowed them,\" he explains. \"Since nearly any question on any matter of substance is clearly going to have a departmental minister to answer it, the only way to get the prime minister on his feet to take a question was to table 'To ask the prime minister to list his engagements for x date'.</p> <p>\"Once he'd answered that question, the Speaker would usually then allow supplementaries, which could be on anything, but since they were supplementary questions, the prime minister would be in the answering hot-seat.\" Oscar continues with an explanation of why the practice was maintained despite Tony's PMQs reforms in 1997, but sadly space doesn't permit it. Congratulations, and How Parliament Works - as if you needed it - will be in the post shortly.</p> <p>&gt;&gt;&gt; THIS WEEK'S COMPETITION</p> <p>The Backbencher was thinking of descending from the sublime to the ridiculous by giving away Boris Johnson's dreadful Seventy-Two Virgins. The best thing about this \"effortlessly brilliant page-turner\" (the Daily Telegraph, oddly enough) is the extremely flattering photo of Boris on the jacket.

But security turned her away: \"You don't have permission to access <a href=\"http://www.georgewbush.com/\">georgewbush.com</a> on this server.\" Was it something she said? No: it turns out that no one outside the US can visit the home of the US president. Thank God, then, for the White House site, which is rightly avoiding all mention of the election. And thank God for the <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/interactive/\">White House Interactive section</a>, which invites inquiries from Americans on policy matters. \"We are a small manufacturing firm in Livonia, MI,\" writes Tom. \"Been in business since 1969.

Clearly bored with early pictures of Barney \"striking a classic pose\", \"casting a shadow\" and \"looking out for cicadas\", the White House web staff have been forced to liven up the daily portrait.</p> <p>On August 3, for example, \"To no avail, Barney attempts to persuade his Secret Service friends to help him dig up the Rose Garden.\" What was his master doing the day before? Why, delivering a speech on reforming the intelligence services. Or take July 7: \"Barney, on a walk in the woods, considers the road not taken.\" George, meanwhile, was preparing a speech on the American Dream. On September 12, the day after the third anniversary of 9/11 and the occasion for a broadcast on 'Three Years of Progress in the War on Terror': \"After talking Faith Based Director Jim Towey into attempting to jump over the White House on a motorcycle, Barney heads up the safety response team.\" By September 26, George is assuring Florida of federal assistance after Hurricane Jeanne. \"A believer in delegating responsibility, Barney ignores specific directions to sweep the White House driveway and tells Willie the Cat to start working.\" Call it coincidence if you like. But a visit to <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/barney/\">Barney's site</a> today confirms that he is waiting impatiently for \"Willie the Cat\" to choose a Halloween pumpkin.

  "<p>In Europe the impact of next week's presidential election will be felt directly - the countries of \"old\" and \"new\" Europe will react very differently to the result - and indirectly on the EU's relations with the middle east, central Asia and Africa.</p> <p>Emil Kirchner, professor of European studies at Essex University, sees the possibility of a surprising amount of cooperation in a second Bush term - but also the potential for even deeper splits, notably over Iran.</p> <p>Europe is divided over President George W Bush, with the \"new Europe\" of former Soviet bloc countries like Poland and the Baltic states much more favourably disposed towards him than France, Germany and (since this year's election) Spain.</p> <p>The European security strategy adopted at a summit last September is clearly at odds with the Bush policy of pre-emptive force, Professor Kirchner points out. Europe's recipe for dealing with conflict is \"pre-emptive engagement\" - the use of diplomatic, economic and political tools to head off conflict rather than getting your retaliation in first. Iraq is the most glaring example of how the US and its European allies - apart from Britain of course - have fallen out over this. \"Europeans would feel there would be continuous clashes with Bush at the helm unless he learns from Iraq and changes policy.\" </p> <p>He may learn something different from Iraq, of course. If, as expected, Colin Powell steps down from the State Department, the influence of Donald Rumsfeld and the vice-president, Dick Cheney, could grow and a successful assault on Faluga might reinforce their belief that force is working and could be applied to Iran, the other member of the \"axis of evil\". The question of how to deal with Iran could strain relations with Europe further. Even Tony Blair would find his loyalty stretched if a future Bush administration opted for military measures there.</p> <p>Professor Kirchner doubts whether president John Kerry would change policy radically but he would be viewed more favourably. \"At least there would be a feeling that we have a fresh start and we're not dealing with the same adversary.\"</p> <p>In his view Kerry would try for a more multilateral approach but he would be unlikely to back the Kyoto agreement on global warming or the international criminal court. Professor Kirchner, who has lived and taught in the US, adds: \"I don't think the American character will change. The 9/11 attacks have done something to their psyche that will carry on for some time.\"</p> <p>It's not clear whether the Poles and other east Europeans are pro-Bush or simply pro-American, and in any case their involvement in Iraq could have repercussions on the incumbent president's popularity there, he says. Professor Kirchner does not see the fractured state of Europe being healed by the new constitution, even if it is adopted, but by growing prosperity. </p> <p>\"Europe has always delivered economically. If it can do that sufficiently for the new countries they will come around much more to a kind of shared understanding and similar values. The ethos of the EU is peaceful coexistence.\" </p> <p>When it comes to the admission of Turkey to the EU, the US has always been strongly in favour because it fits with its policy in the middle east; that won't change under Kerry. What is changing, argues Professor Kirchner, is the attitude of Germany and France. Joschka Fischer, the German foreign minister, has spoken strongly in favour of Turkey as a secular state that could bridge Islam and Europe and Jacques Chirac has been making similar noises. With the UK broadly in favour, Professor Kirchner argues Italy will fall into line. Beyond Turkey, Europe's attempts to build partnerships with the kingdoms of the middle east and achieve a settlement in Palestine will become even more important - but a potential source of argument with the US.</p> <p>Europe's borders have shifted to the east and Turkey would bring it into contact with the states of the Caucasus like Georgia and Armenia, and with central Asia. </p> <p>\"The Americans understand there is a rough division of labour if the EU gets involved in the Caucasus and central Asia - that's burden-sharing. Take Afghanistan - the Europeans are running the peace-building programme,\" notes Professor Kirchner, who concludes that Germany is still anti-war but behind the scenes is prepared to work with the US. </p> <p>\"I think there will be more of a division of labour emerging in the next four years, certainly under Kerry but even under Bush - but there are still the risk of rupture points, especially Iran.\" In November the issue of Iran's nuclear programme comes to the UN and if Bush is in belligerent mood that would provoke a deeper split with Europe.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The University of Essex is holding a one-day conference on the European constitutional treaty next Wednesday November 3 at the Moot Hall, Colchester.

The fact that the site was not protected is in itself criminally negligent.\"</p> <p><strong>Little Green Footballs</strong> had a problem. The story, if true, appeared to back up the senator's charge of inadequate postwar planning. But in the blogosphere there is always an <a href=\"http://littlegreenfootballs.com/weblog/?entry=13288\">answer</a>. \"I guess John Kerry feels we were safer when the material was in the hands of Saddam Hussein, because after all ... Saddam was no threat, even though ... he had hundreds of tons of high explosives that could be used to manufacture nuclear weapons, but ... he had no plans for WMD ... uh ... but ... I'm getting a headache.\"</p> <p>That post was logged at 8.27am on Monday. Twelve hours and four minutes later, came <a href=\"http://littlegreenfootballs.com/weblog/?entry=13295\">a line pro-Bush bloggers could run with</a>. \"Drudge has an NBC report that the explosives stockpile at al-Qaqaa vanished before US troops arrived in the area,\" read the top post at the site.</p> <p>\"Vanished\" was not quite the word NBC used but it was enough to put the pro-Kerry bloggers on the back foot.</p> <p>Within hours, <strong>Talking Points Memo</strong> had a <a href=\"http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/week_2004_10_24.php#003800\">rebuttal</a> detailing its problems with the \"Drudge/NBC 'It was gone when we got there' hypothesis\".</p> <p>\"Military and non-proliferation analysts say that a detachment of soldiers not specifically trained in weapons inspections work and certainly an NBC news crew simply wouldn't be in a position to make such a determination,\" wrote Joshua Micah Marshall, the blog's author, as he outlined his first line of defence. \"We're not talking about a storage unit with a few boxes in it, but a massive weapons complex made up of almost a hundred buildings and bunkers.\"</p> <p>But those were not the doubts on the Bush supporting sites. With his wind in his sails, Captain Ed steered his <strong>Captain's Quarters</strong> blog onto <a href=\"http://www.captainsquartersblog.com/mt/archives/002862.php\">questioning what the New York Times was up to</a>, especially as it was running with the story for a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/26/politics/campaign/26campaign.html\">second day</a>. \"This agenda-driven journalism threatens to deflate the Paper of Record's reputation just as surely as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uselections2004/story/0,13918,1308988,00.html\">Rathergate</a> did CBS, fake documents or no. The Times needs to place a moratorium on further articles on missing weapons until it does proper research, and it owes its readers and the Americans in Iraq working munitions demolitions a big apology.\"</p> <p>This is probably where it would have ended \u2013 Bush supporters attacking the NYT, Kerry supporters doubting the explosives were already gone \u2013 had NBC not neglected to run the weapons-already-gone story on its <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/\">MSNBC</a> website and, by Tuesday night, issued a clarification. Evening anchor Tom Brokaw said it had reported the 101st airborne could not find the explosives, not that they had gone before the Americans arrived. \"That is possible, but that is not what we reported,\" he told viewers.</p> <p>So 24 hours after the first twist you got a second, and the happiest faces were on the Kerry side. <strong>Talking Points Memo</strong> suggested the White House staff should have <a href=\"http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/week_2004_10_24.php#003812\">heeded Bush's advice</a> from the last debate not \"to quote leading news organisations\" before basing their line \"on a short blurb on NBC Nightly News that fell apart about as quickly as it took to get all their surrogates to start talking about it.\"</p> <p>Not that the pro-Bush bloggers have stopped talking about it. <strong>Power Line</strong> accuses the pro-Kerry spin of slandering US soldiers on the ground by taking the word of NBC correspondents that the complex was not searched. \"This story now really is about the performance of our troops at the al-Qaqaa facility, and there appears to be no credible evidence that they did not perform competently there.\"</p> <p>When a story has been running this long and at this intensity no one wants to give it up.</p>",
  "Denver resident and Democrat Aaron Gottlieb, 27, was so convinced John Kerry had no chance in Colorado, he nearly caught a flight to Oregon to canvass in a closer race. But yesterday he found himself sitting at a phone in Kerry headquarters in downtown Denver, with a long list of undecided voters in front of him, hoping he could give Kerry an edge in a race that seems - just possibly - winnable. <p>\"I just started doing this 10 minutes ago,\" he admits. \"I never got involved before because it was always a given that this would be red [Republican] state. But now we have a chance to make it blue.\"</p> <p>The election in Colorado should be a foregone conclusion. This is Republican country, a state with two Republican senators and five out of seven Republican members of the House of Representatives. Bill Clinton managed a win here in 1992, but only because third party candidate Ross Perot ate into George Bush Sr's natural lead. Before Clinton, you have to dig back to Lyndon Johnson in 1964 for a Democratic victory.</p> <p>So why has Colorado - long a state safely ignored in presidential elections - become such a popular stop on the political itinerary of both parties? George Bush has been to Colorado twice in just over a week, and Dick Cheney and John Kerry were both here on Saturday. The state's TV networks are so jammed with politicians trashing each other in ads that the normally ubiquitous SUV and truck commercials have all but disappeared from the airwaves.</p> <p>Bill Ray, spokesman for the Colorado Republican party, says the answer is simple: this spring, two-term Republican senator Ben Nighthorse-Campbell announced his retirement, giving the Democrats a chance to take a critical Senate seat. A popular Colorado Democrat, Ken Salazar, stepped into the race against Republican beer magnate Pete Coors, and suddenly things began to look very different. Kerry, Ray says, is riding Salazar's coattails. </p> <p>\"The Senate race will go right down to the wire, and Salazar is very popular in this state. People who are going to come out to vote for Salazar are probably going to vote for Kerry,\" he admits. Salazar has also energised Latinos, an increasingly important group in Colorado, explains Jim Tankersley, political reporter for the Rocky Mountain News. As Latinos tend to vote Democratic, a candidate who convinces this powerful demographic to turn out on election day will benefit Kerry. </p> <p>Over at Kerry's Denver headquarters, spokesman Andy Davis insists that Colorado is in play because moderate Republicans feel isolated from the Bush administration, and that those voters have turned to Kerry.</p> <p>\"Colorado has a moderate, independent-minded electorate, and that's true of the West as a whole. This electorate is not wed to either party, and they do not like the deeply ideological bent of this particular administration,\" Davis says. </p> <p>Tankersley agrees. He believes Bush has alienated a certain class of conservative, particularly moderates who are environmentalists, a key issue in a state proud of its vast wilderness and reliant on tourists who flock to hike, ski and fish in it. Fiscal conservatives have also felt let down by Bush's rocketing deficit, he says.</p> <p>Nonsense, says Ray. \"The president appeals to Colorado Republicans. He's from Texas, so he's not an east or west coaster. Bush is a man with convictions, who stands by his decisions and is not swayed by opinion polls or political expediency. Colorado Republicans respect that.\" Both parties point to the state's considerable military ties - Colorado features the hollowed-out Cheyenne Mountain military complex, where Norad is based - as important for their candidates. Ray says military voters respect Bush as a strong commander in chief, while Davis argues that Iraq has weighed heavy on military families and gained ground for Kerry. </p> <p>Jobs and the economy have also been a central feature of the campaign in Colorado, as they have elsewhere in the US. The Democrats say Colorado has been hard hit by job losses in the last four years, but Ray claims the state's unemployment rate is well below the national average, at 4.9%. The Democrats' unrelenting focus on Bush being the first president to preside over a net loss of jobs since Herbert Hoover ignores the impact of the September 11 terrorist attacks on the economy, he adds. </p> <p>Both parties agree that unaffiliated voters will be crucial in Colorado. According to the Denver Post, the state has 1.1 million registered Republicans, 936,500 registered Democrats, and 1million independent voters. And Davis, for one, is happy to have forced the president to fight for the support of those voters. </p> <p>\"We forced the Republicans to spend money and resources and time here, and that's money they won't be spending in Ohio or Florida or Pennsylvania,\" he says. \"The fact that Bush is spending time and money on a state he won by eight points in 2000 is an indication of our success.\"</p> <p>Even given his sense that moderates have been uncomfortable with Bush, Tankersley still expects to wake up on November 3 with Bush taking the state. Ray points out that Kerry has pulled his ads in Colorado for the week before the election, which he reads as a sign that the Democrats no longer consider Colorado a battleground. The Kerry campaign insists they simply want to focus on mobilising those undecided, independent voters. </p> <p>At the Kerry campaign's Denver headquarters, Connie Dotson, 58, who has been working the phones for the last month, feels the race for undecided voters is largely over. She does not know which way the election will go on November 2, but her experience of cold calling independent voters says there is little room left for persuasion.</p> <p>\"This last week, most of the people that were undecided have pretty much made up their minds,\" she says. \"In the last two days I worked here, I spoke to no one who was undecided.\"</p>",
  "There's no question that if France was voting for the next US president, John Kerry would be victorious. The Bush administration era has been catastrophic for Franco-American relations, and France is impatient for a new leader with a more multilateral approach to foreign affairs. <p>The French distaste for the Bush administration is evident in all the polls. A recent survey showed that Kerry would win as much as 82% of the French vote, while George Bush would secure a mere 16%. Around 70% of French people say that their opinion of America has deteriorated over the past three years, 75% of the population say that they have a poor opinion of Bush, and 77% say that they believe the US-led campaign in Iraq was a mistake.</p> <p>Even a cursory glance at relations between France and America over the past three years explains this thirst for a change. Before the row over Iraq, there was already growing French irritation with the US for its refusal to sign the Kyoto protocol, its decision to withdraw its support for the anti-ballistic missile treaty and its opposition to the international court on war criminals. Then the French opposition to the US-led campaign in Iraq triggered a furious exchange of transatlantic insults. Donald Rumsfeld sneered at the \"old Europe\" of France and Germany, which was quickly dubbed the Axis of Weasel. There was the charge that the French were nothing more than cheese-eating surrender monkeys, then there was the enthusiastic rush to rebrand chips as Freedom fries. </p> <p>President Chirac in turn berated the Americans for opening up \"a Pandora's box which none of us can shut\" in Iraq. </p> <p>Such is the current climate of Francophobia in America, that Kerry has been encouraged by his Democratic campaign team not to flaunt the fact that he speaks fluent French and has relatives in France. And in the last weeks of the campaign, Bush has sought to score new points by hardening his tone still further towards the French. \"The use of troops to defend America must never be subject to a veto by countries like France,\" Bush told supporters in Allentown, Pennslyvania last month. Even the mention of France drew boos from the crowd.</p> <p>Given this background of mutual hostility, the powerful desire across France to see a change of administration is understandable and expectations are unfeasibly high. But as France watches the last stages of the US presidential race with interest, there is an awareness that this \"anyone but Bush\" approach may lead to disappointment. </p> <p>There is no guarantee that Kerry will improve relations with France as much as France would like, and there is uncertainty over whether Kerry's policies are really set to be sufficiently different from those of Bush to justify this level of support. \"If Kerry were to be elected, the honeymoon [of France-American relations] would be short,\" Le Figaro warned this week, citing a long list of issues on which Europe was set to be pitted against America, whoever becomes its next president - Iraq, Iran, China and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Commercial disputes could worsen under Kerry - the Democrats are traditionally more protectionist than the Republicans. The risk of disappointment is very great and analysts warn that France could see old divisions re-emerging very quickly, even if there is a change of president.</p> <p>Guillaume Parmentier, director of the French Centre on the United States told the newspaper that the French hopes of a new friendly era under Kerry were misplaced. \"Europeans believe that it's possible to see a return of a multilateralist America. But since 9/11, it's over. Their America is an America of their own fantasy.\"</p> <p>Kerry has stated his desire to see French and German troops in Iraq, but France has made it equally clear that it is unwilling to provide any support for the campaign. Foreign minister Michel Barnier has ruled out the possibility of any troops \"now or later\".</p> <p>\"If Kerry is elected, he will have to establish his position and prove that he is capable of having better international relations than his predecessor,\" Pascal Boniface, director of the Institut des relations internationales et strat\u00e9giques in Paris, said.</p> <p>If the Democrats win, there is no suggestion that the transatlantic abuse will stop. US newspapers reported that the Democratic Senator Joe Biden, a contender to become Kerry's secretary of state, recently criticised French President Jacques Chirac for having \"an ego as big as this room,\" adding that the French have \"been a pain in the you-know-what.\" </p> <p>But France's media are nevertheless gunning for Kerry. In an editorial published this week, the left-leaning Lib\u00e9ration said that a victory for Bush would mean that America would remain an \"arrogant, imperialistic superpower\" which would worsen the international \"anti-American hatred which has grown spectacularly under his presidency\".</p>",
  "Kremlin officials say Mr Putin is attending a celebration of the liberation of Kiev from the Nazis, but the opposition has claimed the visit was timed to allow him to influ-ence the electorate with his choice for president, the prime minister, Viktor Yanukovich, six days before the crucial vote. <p>Mr Putin told Ukrainian television that visa restrictions between Russia and Ukraine would be eased. He also floated the possibility of dual citizenship for Ukrainian and Russian citizens, a popular move among voters. </p> <p>Mr Putin said that, in relations with Russia, the recent government had positively \"structured our relationship not only in economics... [but] in politics as well\". </p> <p>The trip was expected to add to the tension surrounding the poll. A pro-opposition lawmaker said he escaped unhurt when his car was firebombed on Monday, and a student group claimed its offices were raided by the country's secret service. </p> <p>The opposition candidate, Viktor Yushchenko, has claimed he was poisoned and opposition journalists have gone on hunger strike to protest at what they call a government clampdown. </p> <p>The government has dismissed the incidents as publicity stunts. </p> <p>The incumbent president, Leonid Kuchma, said campaigning so far had \"exceeded the framework of human decency\". He cancelled a trip to neighbouring Poland after thousands took to the streets at the weekend. </p> <p>Mr Putin has met Mr Yanukovich several times in Moscow to express his support, and pro-Yanukovich posters have been put up all over the Russian capital. </p> <p>In comments carried on his website, Mr Yushchenko called Mr Putin's visit \"untimely\". </p> <p>He said he was not among those who \"overestimate Russia's influence on Ukraine's election results\". But added: \"Yanukovich lacks his own authority to win these elections.\" </p> <p>Mr Yushchenko has also complained at not being allowed on nationwide television during prime-time. </p> <p>Dmitri Pskov, a Kremlin spokesman, said Mr Putin was in Kiev at the invitation of the incumbent president, as were the presidents of Azerbaijan, Belarus and Kazakhstan. He said Mr Putin was giving an interview, as \"he often does when travelling\". </p> <p>He rejected accusations that the visit was timed to influence Sunday's vote. </p> <p>\"There are norms of political ethics and Mr Putin is a wise enough president not to use such trips to make public his preferences,\" he said. </p> <p>The opposition has also protested against Russia's decision to set up 41 polling booths for ethnic Ukrainians living in Russia, who are more likely to support Mr Yanukovich. </p> <p>The Yushchenko campaign has said the stations are for an alleged 150,000 voters living abroad yet, they added, Ukraine does not recognise dual citizenship and most of those targeted were ineligible to vote. </p> <p>An MP and leading ally of Mr Yushchenko, Volodymyr Bondarenko, said yesterday his car had been firebombed in a village near Kiev. No one was injured. </p> <p>The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe said the lead-up to the vote had been marred by biased use of the media in favour of Mr Yanukovich. </p>",
  "<p>I've been searching around for a count of US newspapers' endorsements for the US election, and hit the jackpot with Editor &amp; Publisher's <a href=\"http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000684814\">daily endorsement tally</a>. The journal's latest figures show that Kerry has secured the backing of 142 US papers, compared to 123 who have plumped for Bush. Kerry is also ahead in terms of total circulation of his backers, according to E&amp;P, at about 17.5m to 11.5m. Perhaps the most interesting figure to be drawn from E&amp;P's research is the fact that 37 papers have \"flip-flopped\" from Bush to Kerry, compares to just six who've changed from Kerry to Bush since 2000. </p> <p>Meanwhile in the UK, the Financial Times has <a href=\"https://registration.ft.com/registration/sub/barrier.jsp?location=http%3A//news.ft.com/cms/s/daed85d4-2622-11d9-81d9-00000e2511c8.html&amp;resource=ftarc\">endorsed </a> Kerry (registration required but there is a free 15-day trial), while Dan Gillmor has <a href=\"http://weblog.siliconvalley.com/column/dangillmor/archives/010933.shtml#010933\">reported rumours</a> that the Economist is also going to back the Democrat candidate.

  "If George Bush took a break from election campaigning to ponder Africa he might feel aggrieved. After all that effort, all those bold policies to tackle poverty and disease, Africans want him to lose next week. <p>From the US administration's point of view that must rankle. Here is a continent which for the past four years basked in Washington's attention and money, pocketing favours in trade and aid from a generous president. </p> <p>Before his election in 2000, Bush bluntly stated that Africa was of no strategic interest to the US. But in office he became passionate about boosting economic ties and treating millions of people with HIV/Aids. He visited Senegal, South Africa, Botswana, Uganda and Nigeria, called leaders by their first names and invited them to the White House.</p> <p>So for Africa to wish him a speedy farewell from office must strike Bush as ingratitude on a grand scale. </p> <p>\"If Africa was to vote, Kerry would get a landslide,\" said Robert Kabushenga, a political analyst in Uganda, told Reuters. </p> <p>\"All public opinion surveys show the publics of the world don't know Kerry but they don't like Bush. Someone sitting in Chad doesn't know who Kerry is, but he sure knows who Bush is,\" said John Stremlau, a professor of international relations at Johannesburg's Witwatersrand University. </p> <p>Why does Africa not cheer for Bush? Here is a man who entered the White House in 2000 giving the continent no reason to expect him to care but to everyone's surprise he did.</p> <p>His administration continued and extended a preferential trade pact, called Agoa, which boosted employment and exports in places like Lesotho and Madagascar.</p> <p>The president also pledged $15bn over five years to combat the HIV/Aids pandemic and launched the Millennium Challenge Account fund, which offered aid to countries that demonstrated good governance.</p> <p>Critics picked holes: Agoa was no substitute for serious trade reform; the Aids money was slow in coming and downplayed condoms to appease right-wing Republicans; Bush's sole visit to Africa was a five-day whistle-stop of photo-ops with just a few hours in Botswana and Uganda.</p> <p>Even so, many were impressed by the administration's commitment. The musician and veteran activist Bob Geldof praised the Texan as Africa's best friend since John Kennedy and contrasted him with Bill Clinton who he said made sweeping promises but delivered little.</p> <p><b>Loud and proud</b></p> <p>Yet Africa roots for Kerry. Few premiers are so undiplomatic as to say it publicly but commentators and ordinary people across the continent are loud and proud in voicing support for the Democrat.</p> <p>It is not that they know or like him. Besides promising a more robust challenge to Sudanese abuses in Darfur Kerry has said little about Africa. Nor are they especially impressed by his wife, Teresa Heinz Kerry, romanticising her upbringing in Mozambique and South Africa. It is enough that Kerry is not Bush. </p> <p>Partly it is a matter of style. Clinton's empathetic touch drew huge crowds in Nigeria, where boulevards were named after him, whereas heightened security for Bush's visit distanced him from ordinary people. </p> <p>Partly it is the unilateralism. Africa cherishes organisations like the United Nations as a forum where poor, weak states can speak to rich, powerful ones. Bush's overt disregard for the UN went down badly. </p> <p>The war in Iraq is extremely unpopular with a continent full of memories of western imperialism. Nelson Mandela was not alone in accusing Bush of not being able to \"think properly\". When the president refused to take his calls Mandela complained to his father, George Bush Sr.</p> <p>Regardless of who wins on November 2, US policy in Africa is unlikely to change much. Kerry may send troops to Sudan but his administration would almost certainly continue Bush's championing of west African oil, to lessen dependence on the Middle East, as well as the deployment of small military units in north and east Africa to train the region's armies in counter-terrorism.</p> <p>A report commissioned by Congress, called Rising US Stakes in Africa, said it had assumed a new, strategic place in US foreign policy and in the definition of vital US national interests. </p> <p>\"This shift moves the United States away from the past habit of treating Africa as a humanitarian afterthought and begins to reverse a decade-long decline in the United States' presence and engagement in Africa,\" said the report.</p> <p>Kerry or Bush, Africa will stay on Washington's agenda.</p>",
  "The grenade was about 60cm tall, and leaned against the wall of the Ukrainian interior ministry. Fortunately for the Kiev police special-forces and opposition activists surrounding it, it was made out of papier-mache and sausages. <p>The device had been planted last Tuesday around the ministry's outside wall by Pora, a group of activists sided with the Ukrainian opposition's presidential candidate, Viktor Yushchenko. It was their response to police raiding their headquarters the weekend before and allegedly finding a grenade planted there.</p> <p>Comprised mainly of volunteers Pora's aim is clear: they will protest against the results of Sunday's presidential elections on Monday, irrespective of what the results are.</p> <p>Vladislav Kaskil, a senior coordinator or Pora, has said, presumably referring to biased campaign coverage by state TV: \"We can already say that these elections have not been democratic.\" He added that the group had 15,000 members, only peaceful intentions, but was set on change. \"We [in Ukraine] have the biggest experience of peaceful protest in all of Europe. This is our only opportunity and Ukrainian citizens will be to blame if we cannot use this chance to bring about democracy.\"</p> <p>As he and Pora's other main activists stood around the grenade talking to TV cameras, two soldiers from the special forces joked with each other and a journalist nearby. It was a worrying sign for a small man in a long dark leather coat, who whispered into a walkie-talkie and did his best to look just like a member of the security services as he watched the protest. The police seemed like they would not take that seriously any order to turn on these protestors - either then or during any protests that follow the election.</p> <p>The security services agent approached the two police and barked: \"What are you doing? This man [the journalist] could be a criminal. And then you would have compromised yourself by talking to him and being filmed doing it. Are you idiots?\"</p> <p>The policemen grinned again, at each other and the journalist. The journalist asked the small man who he was. He replied: \"It is good that neither of us know who the other one is.\" The journalist asked again to get the reply: \"Do you have a problem? Do you have a problem?\"</p> <p>Ukraine's fourth presidential vote this Sunday has been predictably overshadowed by the comparatively paltry shenanigans happening across the Atlantic. In Kiev, protests have already begun and talk of revolution is omnipresent. The president has cancelled his planned trip to Poland to stay at home and firefight, and the mayor of Kiev has also already banned any further opposition protests from the capital.</p> <p>It is the endgame of a surreal battle lasting several months that has only deepened the average Ukrainian's disillusionment with democracy and politicians. After a decade of rule by the authoritarian Leonid Kuchma, voters face a bewildering backdrop as they try to choose his successor.</p> <p>First the opposition candidate, Mr Yushchenko, claimed he had been poisoned and fell ill for weeks. Then Viktor Yanukovich, the pro-Russian and government candidate, claimed opposition activists pelted him at a rally with metal objects, not eggs.</p> <p>Next, the opposition said President Kuchma intended to assassinate his chosen successor so he could declare a state of emergency and stay in power. Then 90 tonnes of posters comparing the opposition candidate to an American mosquito sucking Ukraine's blood dry turned up in a warehouse near the capital, Kiev. A campaign office was blown up. Yesterday, an opposition MP said his car was pelted with firebombs.</p> <p>Russia has set up 41 polling stations inside its own borders for Ukrainian citizens, despite the opposition claiming dual citizens do not have the right to vote. They have protested the move which most accept would make vote falsification a lot easier for Mr Yanukovich's side. President Putin flew in today to give his blessing to Mr Yanukovich, and star in a live question-and-answer session broadcast simultaneously on three nationwide TV channels.</p> <p>Sympathy will doubtless fall on the side of Mr Yushchenko in the coming weeks, even if he leads his supporters in peaceful protests designed to hand him victory in the election. He told The Guardian he wants an \"honest, democratic election that does not reflect the interests of Russia, the EU or US, but of the Ukrainian electorate\". </p> <p>He said: \"If we see a significant falsification, then I will be on the side of the people and we may take mass action. I will be with the people.\"</p> <p>From thousands of miles away, it is possible to see this election unashamedly in terms of black and white. A Washington Post columnist this week roared that Mr Yushchenko would: \"Lead an independent and democratic country toward partnership with the west\", whilst Mr Yanukovich would probably ensure Ukraine \"slides toward authoritarian rule\".</p> <p>Yet try asking Ukrainians how they feel and broader dissatisfaction with each candidate emerges. Alexander, 32, likes \"Yushchenko the person, but Yanukovich's policies\". Grigori Parkhomenko, an engineer, will vote for Yushchenko, not because he is the people's moral champion, but because any change is good for the future.</p> <p>Alina Inayeh, head of the Freedom House organisation in Kiev, said one of the main problems of the election is that it has been portrayed in: \"black and white, as a choice between Russia and the EU, between the future and the past, between being poor and being well-off. In reality, their policies will not be that different from each other.\"</p> <p>One analyst remarked: \"The bandits [of big business] will go to jail immediately under Yushchenko, and a few months later under Yanukovich.\" Granted, the political future for Ukraine that Mr Yushchenko's supporters envisage will be freer than the quasi-Russian slide back into authoritarianism and Soviet control that Mr Yanukovich's Moscow backers may be expecting. </p> <p>Mr Yanukovich, the current prime minister, has become very close to the Kremlin, who are not renown for their visions of transparent, reformist politics. One senior western diplomat said Mr Yanukovich, had \"made a lot of people frightened\". But Mr Yushchenko is perhaps not the white knight his US supporters portray him as: he too has served in the Kuchma government, and has a few rich backers.</p> <p>When it comes to the 1,650 Ukrainian troops in Iraq, which most Ukrainians oppose, the candidates have different rhetoric, yet the same shade of grey as a reply. Mr Yushchenko's promise to withdraw the men is tempered with the pledge not to \"discomfort\" Ukraine's allies - the new Iraqi government and the US. Mr Yanukovich counters that the troops will come home some time after the election, in January.</p> <p>Yet black and white is the chosen language of revolution. Ukraine's political future has lost its ideal focus on which political leader and party is best for its development and been transformed into a hi-calorie battle between two former cold war superpowers - the US and Russia.</p> <p>Moscow fears that if Ukraine - Europe's largest country - faces west, it will lose a large part of its geopolitical influence in eastern Europe. Kremlin hawks seek to create a \"unified economic zone\" between Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and Kazakhstan - a privatised Soviet Union of sorts what could wield its economic clout from China to Poland.</p> <p>Washington wants Ukraine to join NATO and be another ally in New Europe, another former dictatorship swept up in the \"march of freedom\".</p> <p>The US government has openly put money into voter education and democracy support. Yet the money has an unspoken consequence, in a country where the state tries to control the electoral process and its media coverage, it boosts the opposition.</p> <p>The US ambassador, John Herbst, was sure to add to the pre-electoral drama when he noted in a speech on October 7th: \"Some observers suggest that this is the most important vote since the referendum on independence. Still other observers speak of the election in Manichean terms as a struggle between good and evil.\"</p> <p>Yet a quick glance at Kiev's high streets can explain where the country is inevitably headed. Where two years ago there were empty Soviet-style shops, today there are chain stores and booming shopping centres.</p> <p>Ukraine used to carry the moniker of one of the former Soviet Union's most impoverished states, yet now its government boasts - and a senior western diplomat can almost vouch for - 14% growth. Economic growth will speed Ukraine towards its European neighbours and eventually foster a society where people expect a government that respects their property rights, and their ability to do business and speak their minds freely, wiping away the cobwebs of the Soviet era. </p> <p>The high-noon showdown that Moscow and Washington have engineered here will perhaps have done little other than set Ukraine up for a brittle and fractious handover of power. There will be protests. There may be blood. There may be a new set of people in power. Yet the difficulties and new extremes that lie ahead for the Ukrainian voter - be that the mass sacking of an old government's bureaucrats or a lurch back towards authoritarian Russia - have simply grown since the former cold war enemies chose to duel over their future.</p> <p>Again, politically indifferent and disillusioned Ukrainians want little to do with their soiled brand of democracy. As Yuri, one taxi driver, said last week: \"Tomorrow, I am taking my wife, kids and our stuff and heading for the dacha until it is all over. The police are behind Yanukovich and the army behind Yushchenko. I don't want to be here to find out what happens next.\"</p>",
  "<b> On the road</b> <br> <p><b> In the run-up to polling day, <b> Gary Younge </b> is driving the 2,147 miles from John Kerry's base in Boston, Massachusetts to George Bush's home town of Midland, Texas. Today he reaches Bill Clinton's old home state, Arkansas </b><br> </p> <p> Route 65 dips, rises and swings through the Ozark mountains, past rib shacks offering hickory hams and small stores emblazoned with the confederate flag. \"The past is never dead,\" wrote Mississippi's famous son, William Faulkner, of the south. \"It's not even past.\" </p> <p>And so it is as you pass through the whitest part of Arkansas, a former confederate state, where some residents openly embrace the lost cause to defend a discredited institution - slavery - almost 150 years after it was defeated.</p> <p>Arriving in Little Rock the sun is high and the air is humid. This is the deep south, where salad comes with fried chicken and race comes with everything: it remains the single most consistent indicator of where you live, whom you date, what TV programmes you watch, where you pray and, not least, how you vote.</p> <p>In his office at the state's Democratic party headquarters, Rodney Shelton, who is responsible for outreach to black voters, shows me two maps of Arkansas. One indicates the breakdown of the vote in 2000, with the heavily Democratic areas shaded in progressively darker tones; the other reveals the breakdown of the state by race, coloured in the same way. The patterns are virtually identical - the darker the shade on the map indicating Democrat support, the darker the people who live there.</p> <p>\"The black vote is absolutely critical to the Democratic vote,\" says Mr Shelton. \"We just can't win without it.\"</p> <p>What is true for Arkansas is equally true for the whole country. The Democrats have won only one election since the second world war (in 1964) without the black vote. African Americans make up more than 10% of voters in a third of the crucial battleground states, including Ohio, Florida and Michigan. Yet a recent poll by the Joint Centre for Political and Economic Studies shows that while black Americans have an incredibly low opinion of George Bush - giving him just a 22% approval rating - they have yet to warm to the Democratic challenger, John Kerry. In 2000 the Democratic nominee, Al Gore, got 80% of the black vote to Mr Bush's 9%. This year, the centre's polling shows Mr Kerry on just 68% while the president has doubled his share to 18%.</p> <p>\"This poll is showing a certain amount of black ambivalence in terms of election year issues that resonate within the community, and their relationship with Senator Kerry,\" said Eddie N Williams, the president of the centre. \"They have not yet embraced Senator Kerry to the extent that they did former president Bill Clinton and former vice president Gore.\"</p> <p>Of one of the central planks of Mr Bush's agenda, the war on terror, Hank Wilkins, 22, an African American, said: \"Black Americans have a history of being terrorised in America, so the idea that we could be attacked in our own country was not something new to us.\"</p> <p>The other plank, the war in Iraq, plays badly with most. \"The domestic issues and the foreign policy issues are inter-twined,\" said Vivien Flowers, 35. \"If you look at who's fighting out there it's the folks who don't have jobs or healthcare who joined the army. They were sent for a reason and that reason no longer exists.\"</p> <p>Added to this is the way Mr Bush gained office: the debacle in Florida when a disproportionate number of African American voters were either turned away at the polls or had their votes discounted.</p> <p>\"A lot of people feel that Mr Bush did not win the 2000 election and a huge number of black voters were disenfranchised in Florida,\" said Dale Charles, the chapter president of Little Rock's National Association for the Advancement of Coloured People, the country's oldest civil rights organisation.</p> <p>The joint centre's poll shows that 63% of black Americans are concerned that their vote might not be even be counted next Tuesday. It was an issue Mr Gore stressed on Sunday as he visited black churches in Florida, his presence searing the experience of 2000 into the minds of black voters in the hope that it would galvanise them next week. \"If any of you felt frustrated or angry about what was done four years ago, I want to encourage you not to ignore those feelings,\" he said. \"Don't turn it into angry actions. Love thy neighbour. But vote for your future.\"</p> <p>When it comes to black America in general and Arkansas in particular, Mr Kerry's greatest strength seems to be that he is not Mr Bush; his greatest weakness is that he is not Mr Clinton, who hails from Arkansas.</p> <p>\"I think we were spoiled with Bill Clinton,\" said Mr Charles. The former president's easy personality and southern ways made him a hit with African Americans, the Nobel laureate Toni Morrison once famously describing him as \"our first black president\". Mr Charles added: \"People are picturing someone coming close, so that's tough on Kerry because I don't see any candidate measuring close.\"</p> <p>Mr Clinton's heart condition has kept him away from the campaign trail in the past six weeks. Now he has sufficiently recovered, black Arkansans are hoping he will head home soon to work his magic.</p> <p>Republicans, meanwhile, have been out plying their socially conservative message, leafleting cars outside black churches, reminding voters of their positions on abortion and gay marriage, on which there will be a referendum on polling day. In a community where the church remains the single most powerful mobilising force, their strategy has had some traction but not enough to erase the impression that Republicans stand for the white and the wealthy.</p> <p>\"I know same-sex marriage is totally against the world of God, and I think John Kerry supports it,\" said John Nunn, at his soul-food restaurant near Marvell in the Mississippi Delta. \"But I'm voting Democrat for sure. I don't think Republicans have a clue about poor people.\"</p> <p>When the Democrat president Lyndon Johnson signed the civil rights act in 1964 he told an aide: \"We have lost the south for a generation.\" Forty years on it looks as if they may have lost it for ever.</p> <p>The political realignment of the south and racial realignment of the Democratic party is now virtually complete.</p> <p>The Democrats once dominated the south through their most loyal base, white racists. Now African Americans form the bedrock of their support. Meanwhile Republicans saw an opening by concentrating on the racial fears of whites, post civil rights, in what has become known as Richard Nixon's \"southern strategy\".</p> <p>Now the south is staunchly Republican. Integration of the races has brought about the segregation of the parties - southern whites vote overwhelmingly Republican; most blacks vote Democrat. With the exception of Florida, Arkansas remains the last southern state where the Democrats stand a chance. In 2000, Mr Bush won it by 51% to 46%; the latest poll this year puts the parties even, each on 48%.</p> <p>With six electoral votes at stake in such a close race you would think this would make it a much sought after prize. Other states with fewer votes - Nevada, New Mexico, New Hampshire - are showered with visits and bombarded with ads. But, to the dismay of local Democrats, Mr Kerry has not been here since May. Television ads are few and far between; the yard signs and badges are more scarce. Meanwhile Republican field officers have gone to Colorado, where Mr Kerry is making a strong challenge.</p> <p>\"Arkansas has been devalued,\" said one Democrat insider. \"I think they've given up on the south and that means we're carrying the south on our backs.\"</p> <p>But neither side has pulled out entirely. The Republicans remain a presence with automated phone calls, some ads and local volunteers. The Democrats have several field officers from out of town. \"It's man versus machine,\" said Mr Shelton.</p> <p>In one of the many states where early voting has begun, the scene from the Dunbar community centre last week suggested that it was human endeavour that was winning through. Old, black women in church hats were ferried to the centre two or three at a time; they trooped in and emerged with stickers on their jackets announcing \"I've voted\".</p> <p>As is the case in the rest of the country, most of those who have voted early are in heavily Democratic areas. \"We're dominating the ground game,\" said Mr Shelton. \"And that's where it's going to count.\"</p> <p><b> theguardian.com/uselections2004</b><br></p>",
  "Of all the 20 or so bright-eyed young disc jockeys who turned up for work on the first morning of Radio 1 back in 1967, the one for whom no sane person would have predicted a lasting career with the BBC was John Peel. <p>Yet while the rest of the recruits to the new station either fell by the wayside or evolved into figures of fun, it was the idiosyncratic Peel who became an institution within the corporation and, eventually, within the nation as a whole. </p> <p>Peel's death yesterday at the age of 65, following a heart attack during a working holiday in Peru, deprives British radio of its most distinctive contemporary voice. </p> <p>His self-deprecating mumble, with its distant traces of a Merseyside heritage, was as far from the standard mindless mid-atlantic DJ spiel as could be imagined, yet it cast a spell on generations of young music lovers who could thank him for coaxing them along unexpected pathways that would lead to lasting enthusiasms. </p> <p>In recent years that voice was heard in a different register, on Radio 4's Home Truths, a Saturday morning show whose unpretentious interest in ordinary people's extraordinary stories reflected another side of Peel's character, and whose huge success made many see him in a different light. </p> <p>He sounded just as much at home presenting the tale of a woman trapped by her lack of a birth certificate as he did introducing a demo tape by a new band whose music sounded to the untutored ear like a small truck crashing into a cage full of exotic birds. </p> <p>In his attitude to his vocation, Peel was 65 going on 16. If his fondness for strange music made him a figure of mockery among that first intake of Radio 1 jocks, his consistent support for the new and odd turned out to be a recipe for permanent self-renewal. </p> <p>Probably not even Peel himself could remember all the new styles that he championed throughout a 40-year career. </p> <p>First on Radio London, a mid-60s pirate station, with a show called The Perfumed Garden, and later on the BBC with Top Gear, The Sounds of the Seventies, and finally a show that needed only his name as a guarantee of quality, he promoted the virtues of psychedelia, folk rock, progressive rock, reggae, punk, post-punk, hip-hop, jungle, the Madchester bands, Britpop, drum 'n' bass and dozens of other sub-genres. </p> <p>No one in any medium could match his influence as a supporter of new talent, an influence all the stronger for being wielded without commercial interest or intent. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of musicians owed their careers to his willingness to put their early, sometimes unformed efforts in front of the public. </p> <p>Peel's trust in his audience's open-mindedness led him to take risks that no other disc jockey would have countenanced, as the present controller of Radio 1, Andy Parfitt, noted yesterday when he remembered the standard in-house response to Peel's wilder flights of enthusiasm: \"Is that playing at the right speed, John?\" </p> <p>Sometimes it was indeed playing at the wrong speed, but Peel would merely stop the record, offer a wry apology, and start again. </p> <p>His homespun style made a powerful contrast with the slick self-interest that characterised the majority of his contemporaries, and it won him the trust of listeners who, eventually, would be young enough to be his grandchildren. </p> <p>Born John Ravenscroft in Heswall, Cheshire, he found himself behind the microphone for the first time while living in the United States in the mid-60s. American audiences, newly in thrall to the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, loved his accent, particularly because he added an extra infusion of Scouse twang. </p> <p>On returning to England, where a Radio London secretary suggested a change to the snappier John Peel, he was able to capitalise on a first-hand knowledge of the American groups whose adventures in psychedelia were gathering momentum. </p> <p>Already he had become a friend to the arcane, the recherch\u00e9, the unconsidered and the unlabelled. Not all of it was destined to catch on with a wider audience, but much of it did. </p> <p>On The Perfumed Garden he presented the fey, folk-tinged music of the Incredible String Band, the whimsical English psychedelia of the early Pink Floyd, the poetry of Adrian Mitchell, and musical exotica from the BBC's archives. Top Gear's early regulars included Tyrannosaurus Rex, in the days before Marc Bolan became a pop star, the Soft Machine and King Crimson. </p> <p>The breadth of Peel's tastes in the early 70s could be seen from his championing of Bryan Ferry's Roxy Music and Bob Marley's Wailers, two bands who approaches to popular music could hardly have seemed more different. What they shared, when Peel first gave them exposure, was an unpromising situation. If few music industry people grasped the point of Roxy's raid on the dressing-up box, even fewer believed that reggae could rise up from its musical ghetto. </p> <p>When his proteg\u00e9s became public property, Peel moved on. They no longer needed his help and, unusually among his kind, he was more interested in the next thing. Those countless next things were to include the Clash, Elvis Costello, the Jesus and Mary Chain, the Smiths, Pulp, the White Stripes and Ash, some of whom had grown up listening to his shows. But he never lost his affection for the primal rock'n'roll represented by the work of an early master such as Bo Diddley, or for Captain Beefheart, of whom he was an early and devoted admirer. </p> <p>A man of dry wit, Peel also wrote beautifully and too sparingly. Not long ago he signed a contract to produce his autobiography, for an advance of more than \u00a31m. In it he would have told stories not only of life on the road, of numberless pop festivals and college gigs, but of a domestic existence based around his adored wife, Sheila, their four children, and a menagerie of animals in the family's Suffolk home, from which he continued to radiate powerful beams of support for Liverpool FC, the other significant love of his remarkable life. </p> <p><b>Pirate radio to punk pioneer</b></p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Born in Heswall in the Wirral on August 30 1939.

  "Some of the country's most successful rock musicians yesterday paid tribute to John Peel, the veteran Radio 1 DJ, whom they credited with having played a crucial part in their rise to fame. <p>Damon Albarn, frontman of Blur, said: \"John Peel's patronage was for me, like countless other musicians, one of the most significant things that happened to us in our careers.\" </p> <p>His sentiments were echoed by Feargal Sharkey, former lead singer of the Undertones, one of whose songs was Peel's favourite. \"In the autumn of 1978 something happened that was to change my life forever - John Peel played Teenage Kicks on the radio for the very first time. Today, it just changed again, forever. We have just lost the single most important broadcaster we have ever known.\" </p> <p>Peel, who was 65, died of a heart attack in the Peruvian city of Cuzco where he was enjoying a working holiday with his wife Sheila. </p> <p>He was having pre-dinner drinks at the lobby bar of the Monasterio Hotel, when he suffered a coronary attack at around 9pm local time on Monday evening. He received cardio-pulmonary resuscitation at the scene but died later in hospital. </p> <p>In a telephone interview, Peel's wife said he had been \"perfectly fine\" before the attack: \"We'd been walking around and he was okay until it happened.\" </p> <p>They were on a three-week holiday and had planned to visit the ruins at Machu Picchu before returning to London on Sunday. </p> <p>Peel had always acknowledged that there was a history of early death in his family and he had been diagnosed as suffering from diabetes in September 2001. </p> <p>Last night the DJ Andy Kershaw, a Peel proteg\u00e9, told Channel 4 News that Peel had told him the moving of his show to between 11pm and 1am was \"killing\" him: his regular slot had for years been 10pm till midnight. </p> <p>A hero of more than one generation, Peel's fans crossed the gamut of those who classed him as the godfather of punk and indie music because of his tireless promotion of new music on his Radio 1 show, to those of Middle Britain who loved him for his domestic dawdles on the award-winning Home Truths programme on Radio 4. </p> <p>Peel started his career as a DJ in the United States before returning to the UK to work on a pirate station in London. He began at the BBC in 1967. Through his Radio 1 evening show, Peel discovered dozens of bands and was largely responsible for the popularity of the Clash, the Undertones, the Smiths, as well as opening British ears to Jimi Hendrix, Captain Beefheart and the Velvet Undergound. </p> <p>Singer-songwriter Billy Bragg said Peel had \"defined independent music\". He said: \"Although he became an institution at the BBC, he was, in effect, running his own pirate radio station from within the corporation.\" </p> <p>Radio 1 controller Andy Parfitt said yesterday: \"Hopeful bands all over the world sent their demo tapes to John knowing that he really cared. His commitment and passion for new music only grew stronger over the years.\" </p> <p>Peel had signed a contract to write his memoirs in a publishing deal worth \u00a31.6m. His Who's Who entry lists his recreations as \"making plans to go and live in France, staring out of the window\". </p>",
  "George Bush will ask for $70bn in emergency funding for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan early next year if he is re-elected, as the US military considers raising troop levels by more than 20,000 to secure the planned Iraqi elections, according to reports yesterday. <p>The need for additional funding was one of a series of blows to the re-election hopes of the US president to emerge from Iraq yesterday. In another development, the Iraqi interim prime minister, Ayad Allawi, appeared to turn on his White House supporters when he accused US-led forces of \"major neglect\" over the weekend murder of 49 Iraqi army recruits by insurgents. </p> <p>Mr Allawi told the Iraqi interim national council that the slaughter \"was an ugly crime in which a large group of national guards were martyred. We believe this issue was the outcome of major neglect by some parts of the multinational [forces]\". </p> <p>Iraq's minister of state for national security said later that Mr Allawi was not assigning blame but waiting for the findings of an inquiry into the massacre, due in three weeks. \"The investigation will seek to determine whether inside information was obtained on the movement of troops and why the troops were unarmed,\" Kassim Daoud told Reuters. </p> <p>There was also another kidnapping, this time of a Japanese hostage. A group led by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi threatened to behead the hostage unless Tokyo withdrew its troops from Iraq within 48 hours. </p> <p>US officials said they could not confirm the details of press reports citing the need for extra cash in Iraq, but they said reinforcements would be necessary due to the widespread insurgency, and that the Pentagon would submit a substantial extra-budgetary request for funds to Congress in February. </p> <p>The effort to contain the mounting Iraqi insurgency is consuming about 85% of all spending on the \"global war on terror\" - expected to reach $225bn by the end of next year. </p> <p>John Kerry's supporters were quick to compare the estimates with a prediction made at the end of 2002 by Mitch Daniels, the administration's top budget official, that the war would cost between $50bn and $60bn. \"This is the incredible price of going it almost alone in Iraq,\" Mr Kerry said in Wisconsin. \"How much more will the American people have to pay.\" </p> <p>The mounting costs of the conflict went unmentioned by Mr Bush, who spent yesterday on a last-minute dash through the battleground states of Iowa and Wisconsin, where he continued to accuse his rival of lacking resolve to fight terror. \"We're in the middle of a global war on terror. In the war on terror, there's no place for confusion, no place for weakness, no substitute for victory,\" he said in Wisconsin. </p> <p>\"I believe if America shows uncertainty or weakness in this decade, the world will drift toward tragedy. This will not happen on my watch.\" </p> <p>He added: \"Even if you might not agree with me, you know where I stand.\" </p> <p>The president's campaign aides denied he was being forced on to the defensive. But with the race entering its final days, and with no sign of any steady Republican lead emerging, they were growing jumpy. </p> <p>In public, Mr Bush betrays no nervousness. But in a sign of the tightness of the battle, he launched an effort to win over disillusioned Democrats by accusing Mr Kerry of abandoning his own party's princi ples. \"The party of Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman and John Kennedy is rightly remembered for confidence and resolve in times of war and in hours of crisis,\" he said. \"Senator Kerry has turned his back on 'pay any price'.\" </p> <p>The emergency war spending request expected to be submitted in February would total $70bn, the Washington Post reported yesterday. That is in addition to $25bn already requested for 2005, suggesting the cost of the Iraq and Afghan conflicts is escalating. The administration requested $87bn for war costs this year. </p> <p>Concerned that the multi-national force requested by Washington was unlikely to arrive, US commanders believe they may have to increase American troop levels from an average of 138,000 to 160,000. Officials said the Pentagon is considering delaying the departure of some troops and speeding the arrival of others. </p> <p>A Pentagon spokesman, Lieutenant Colonel Barry Venable, said he could not confirm the troop figures.</p>",
  "The BBC broadcaster John Peel, who has died of a heart attack while on a working holiday in Peru, was perhaps the only British media figure admired by readers of both the NME and the Radio Times. When he turned 65 last August, it was noted that he was the sole senior citizen employed by Radio 1, and his laconic delivery made him popular not just with fans of rock music but also as a presenter of Radio 4's Home Truths and several TV programmes; his wide appeal also brought him voiceover work on commercials. However, he will be remembered above all for his almost religious devotion to seeking out and broadcasting unconventional rock music. <p>Born John Robert Parker Ravenscroft in Heswall, near Chester, he was the son of a successful cotton broker. He went to Woodlands school in Deganwy, north Wales, and Shrewsbury school, and became enamoured of Elvis Presley and rock'n'roll. Indeed, throughout his time on Radio 1 he enjoyed slipping a 1950s tune by Gene Vincent or Roscoe Gordon into his playlist. </p> <p>Peel spent his national service (1957-59) as a B2 Radar operator in the Royal Artillery, and then worked in a mill in Rochdale. In 1960 he moved to Dallas, Texas, and got an office job at radio station WRR. There, in 1963, he covered the assassination of President John F Kennedy for the Liverpool Echo, by attending the press conference at which the police produced Lee Harvey Oswald, about to be charged with the killing. </p> <p>Peel obtained part-time work as a disc jockey on WRR - while he hoped this was because of his musical knowledge, he suspected that it was really due to his accent. As America embraced Beatlemania, Peel found his voice in demand: an Oklahoma City radio station hired him as a full-time DJ. He worked there for 18 months, and then shifted to radio KMEM San Bernardino, California, for another 18 months. </p> <p>Returning to England in 1967, he settled in London, and was initially unable to find work. But an introduction to Alan Keane found Peel installed on pirate station Radio London. His midnight to 2am show, The Perfumed Garden, allowed Peel to broadcast the new album-oriented rock music he had returned from California with, so introducing the likes of Captain Beefheart and Frank Zappa to UK listeners. Listener response was strong, and from then on, Peel continued to broadcast his own leftfield taste. </p> <p>It was at Radio London that he adopted the name John Peel, and when he shifted to the new BBC pop music network, Radio 1, to present his Top Gear programme in late 1967, he kept it. Initially, Peel enjoyed recalling, he had a contract guaranteeing just six weeks' work. </p> <p>Peel's BBC contract specified that each show should feature two or three performers who had been recorded in BBC studios. Peel used this as a springboard to record young bands he favoured. The Peel sessions have since given several thousand bands free recording time and guaranteed airplay. </p> <p>Peel's devotion to promoting new music made him the DJ of choice for several generations of young British rock fans. After the hippies of the 1960s came the progressive rock fans of the early 70s. When punk rock erupted in late 1976, Peel was its radio champion. Punk divided Peel's listeners, and he received abusive, even threatening mail, yet he continued to champion non-mainstream music. He was the first BBC DJ to regularly play dub reggae, and through the 1980s and 90s he would embrace New York hip-hop, Chicago house, Detroit techno, Pakistani qawaali, Congolese soukous, ambient electronica, death metal and alternative country music - broadcasting at its most challenging and innovative. </p> <p>Peel's enthusiasm for new music meant that he helped launch several careers. In 1973, he played the electronic album Tubular Bells, by the then unknown Mike Oldfield, in its entirety: the album subsequently topped the UK charts, so giving Richard Branson's fledgling Virgin Records a massive boost. Peel's enthusiasm for Manchester's the Fall and Derry's the Undertones - whose Teenage Kicks (1978) remained his favourite - helped both win loyal followings. More recently, he was the UK champion of the White Stripes, from Detroit. </p> <p>In 1998, Peel was awarded an OBE: he summed up his work with the words, \"You get free records, you get paid for playing them on the radio, I choose all the music for my own programmes ... it seems to me to be almost the perfect life, really.\" </p> <p>He is survived by his wife Sheila and their two sons and two daughters.</p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>John Peel (John Robert Parker Ravenscroft), disc jockey, born August 30 1939; died October 25 2004</p>",
  "<p>The room where the specialist DJs work at Radio 1 is called G12. Over the past year or so it has become the most creative room Radio 1 has ever enjoyed. This large ground-floor office buzzes with sounds. From one side, the rock music of Zane Lowe's show. From another, the drum'n'bass of Fabio and Grooverider. From another, vibrant Asian-based rhythms from Bobby and Nihal. </p> <p>Into this maelstrom of music (listening on headphones is abandoned after 6pm) would come John Peel on weekday evenings, clasping CDs, vinyl, tapes, letters, cards. His entrance would be greeted with a low roar of approval from us all. </p> <p>\"How are you, sister?\" he would greet me, across our workstations. Our conversation often followed the same pattern. How were we going to find the time to listen to all the music sent to us? For John it had always been an endless problem. He had the widest taste, and so he would be sent a huge variety of music. With a view, of course, to a precious play on the John Peel show. How many careers has he launched? How many thousands of musicians' hearts have soared at hearing their name mentioned, along with the title of their tune, and the meticulous credit of the tiny label that had released it. \"Nottingham's [or wherever's] finest, I'm told,\" he would say, drily. </p> <p>John did not suffer hypocrites gladly. He was honest, sometimes dangerously so. But the BBC couldn't deny that exotic soul of his, which could so fully appreciate Captain Beefheart, the Fall, the Faces and Extreme Noise Terror. Of the latter he would say: \"I am the only person of my age in my neighbourhood who wears their T-shirts.\" </p> <p>Before his shows he would often take his team out for a curry and a glass or two of red wine, before returning to G12. Then it was down to the basement to broadcast his show live from his favourite studio Y1. </p> <p>In another studio, some years previously, John had stuck up a photo of Liverpool footballer Kenny Dalglish, with a handwritten caption: \"God, an informal pose.\" </p> <p>Two weeks ago, in a restaurant in Notting Hill, John was a guest at a Radio 1 dinner for its specialist DJs. He was, as always with his peer group, the centre of attention and originator of many of the laughs we had. His latest discovery, he said, was a band called Steveless. \"They make an LP [John never said album] every week. They're called Steveless because there's no one in the band called Steve.\" </p> <p>I don't know what Steveless or I, or anyone else who loves music, is going to do without John.</p>",
  "Escaping to Rome in 1947 to avoid the gloom of postwar London, the painter John Grome, who has died aged 93, found himself immediately welcomed into the nourishing and sympathetic world of artists in the Italian figurative movement. <p>At a London exhibition of contemporary Italian painting, Grome's eye had been caught by the work of the neorealist Renato Guttuso. Grome set out on a quest to discover more about him, but could hardly have guessed that, soon after arriving in Rome, Guttuso would be offering to share his studio in the Villa Massimo - and become his mentor and friend. </p> <p>Grome quickly became part of a circle of artists and intellectuals who shared a bond in the leftwing politics of postwar Italy. They included the writers Alberto Moravia and Carlo Levi, film directors Pier Paolo Pasolini and Francesco Rosi, and the painter Corrado Cagli. </p> <p>Grome identified completely with Italian life and culture; some of his most beautiful work was inspired by the light and landscape of the Mediterranean when he and his family were living on the Appia Antica and later, in the 1950s, in a small farmhouse at Zagarolo. </p> <p>Grome knew from an early age that painting was at the core of his being. The son of an Irish clergyman, he was born in London and educated at a public school for clergymen's sons, though he resisted all attempts to steer him in that direction. He studied painting at Goldsmiths School of Art. </p> <p>In the early 1930s, Grome taught art at a choir school in Durham. This was a brief appointment; Grome was adventurous and longed to see India. Therefore he joined the Royal Fusilliers, but bought himself out of the army after only seven months. He stayed on in India for nearly five years, teaching English and exploring the country. </p> <p>Soon after Grome returned to England, war broke out. As a conscientious objector, he spent the war years as an ambulance driver in London and was badly injured while rescuing victims of the blitz. </p> <p>He resumed painting in 1945 and rented a studio in Manresa Road, Chelsea. He paid the rent by giving life-drawing lessons; one of his pupils was the actor Alec Guinness. The studios were rented to painters and writers, among them Dylan Thomas and Mervyn Peake. </p> <p>Grome met his wife Mave Beadle in 1950 in Rome, where she was working as a midwife; she remained an extraordinary support throughout their 54 years of marriage. In 1965 they moved back to London so that their three children could be educated there. Grome taught at Hornsey School of Art, but he hated the grey London light and the family returned to Italy after a few years. </p> <p>Grome's work was received with critical acclaim and hangs in private collections in many parts of the world. Guttuso described Grome's paintings as \"keyed to the maximum, passionate, warm and luminous\". In 1964 the critic John Russell said that his paintings revealed that he was completely in tune with Italian life, but had not given up his roots as an English painter. </p> <p>Grome's work was often contemplative and reflective, his subjects sometimes symbolic. One exhibition held in Milan in 1972 was entirely devoted to paintings produced after his introduction to Zen Buddhism. His last public exhibition was a major retrospective in Rome in 1986. </p> <p>Grome had great vitality, optimism and humour. He was a free spirit, ahead of his time in many ways, whose independence gave him the freedom to change his style. He continued to work in his Rome studio every day until a few months before his death. </p> <p>He is survived by Mave and their three children Allegra, Renato and Simon.</p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>John Patrick Grome, painter, born March 14 1911; died July 12 2004</p>",
  "Don't say \"professionalisation\", insists the cabinet secretary sternly. Civil servants are already professionals, but, Sir Andrew Turnbull argues, they never thought it necessary to put a framed certificate on the wall, saying MBA, or member of the Institute of Bankers, or whatever. <p>\"Professionalism is not the exclusive preserve of those disciplines where it is possible to earn letters after one's name,\" says Turnbull, who seems determined to leave as one of his memorials long-lasting changes in the Whitehall skill set. (It is widely assumed, though he won't say, that he would retire next September, provided the general election is held in May.)</p> <p>At a think-in for several hundred officials at a London hotel last week, he unveiled a new scheme. Drafted by a committee led by Sir Richard Mottram, permanent secretary in the Department for Work and Pensions, it involves reskilling the entire civil service. Turnbull does not demur when you prompt him with phrases such as accreditation revolution - though it will take years to work through the system.</p> <p>In future, civil servants must pass through \"gateways\" before setting foot on the next rung of the career ladder. They will have to show they can deliver services and master such corporate skills as finance, statistics and human relations. These gateways will loom at the point of entry to the senior civil service, and again on admission to departmental boards. The gateways will coexist with separate ladders of advancement for specialist accountants, lawyers and scientists.</p> <p>As a result, the terrain of competence in Whitehall is being mapped. Anne Gregory, president of the Institute of Public Relations, has been brought in to review how government press officers are trained. Operational delivery (what big outfits such as the Inland Revenue do) has been given its own \"head of profession\". He is Ian Magee, a social security wizard who is now chief executive for operations (mainly the courts) in the Department for Constitutional Affairs.</p> <p>There will not be specific numbers for staff who have to train in finance, the law, statistics or other specialisms; nor will the Cabinet Office be laying down curricula. Turnbull presents the change as a more gradual move to boost the stock of professional skills for government. \"It's another brick in the edifice of modernisation,\" he says.</p> <p>There is another, intriguing new title that Turnbull has just dispensed. He has created the job of head of profession for policy, to be filled by Sir Brian Bender, permanent secretary at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and formerly in the Cabinet Office. This is an altogether new departure, policy never before having been recognised as a separate territory.</p> <p>The thinking here is both positive and negative. It is about time Whitehall stood up and extolled its own \"traditional\" skill set, including providing ministers with advice. Our own fault, says Turnbull. The skills and leadership needed to negotiate an international treaty or to write then shepherd a piece of legislation through parliament have lacked \"parity of esteem\" with operational and delivery skills.</p> <p>Those older qualities are to be revalidated. To get to the top, civil servants will need to be good at \"political management\", working with ministers and policy advice. No, he does not think that young civil servants should have a master's degree in public administration. But he adds: \"We need to make clear that managing the processes of government, preparing a policy document, delivering public accountability through parliamentary questions and correspondence all require as much professionalism as drawing up the resource accounts or providing scientific advice.\"</p> <p>Turnbull is evidently fed up with outside attacks on \"the generalist culture\". A key document in the debate is a committee of inquiry into the civil service set up 36 years ago by Labour prime minister Harold Wilson and chaired by university vice-chancellor John Fulton. It lambasted Whitehall arrogance and amateurism and did lead to the abolition of the class distinctions that had kept clerks away from the \"first division\". The union for senior civil servants still calls itself the First Division Association.</p> <p>Turnbull says the Fulton inquiry failed because the reformers of the late 1960s \"overplayed their hand\". Change has, instead, to be internally generated.</p> <p>So the civil servant of the future will be neither a generalist nor a specialist. The labels have dogged Whitehall for years. \"One too easily morphs into the Fulton tag of the gifted amateur, drifting rapidly and superficially from one subject to another,\" Turnbull says. \"The specialist tag has too often contributed to a sense of isolation.\"</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> David Walker edits Public, the Guardian's magazine for public executives.

  "<p><strong> Watery graves </strong> </p> <p>The former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev, who now runs Green Cross International, has been celebrating Russia's signing of Kyoto, calling it \"energy perestroika\" and \"highly significant\" coming ahead of elections. This week he explained why he turned green: \"When I became a member of the Soviet leadership, many of our achievements lost their lustre because I learned the environmental price we paid. We built many hydro power stations and they produced a lot of energy, but they flooded vast areas. We saw the steeples of the former churches sticking out above the water, and they looked like funeral crosses.\" </p> <p><strong> Green giant </strong></p> <p> Mike Woodin was one of the Green party's most important leaders, a young Oxford academic, councillor and contributor to these pages. His death in July devastated the party, and there were many heartfelt tributes to him at the party conference. There was good news, too. Last week, another Green, Sushila Dhall, won Woodin's seat, which means they now have 62 councillors and a 10% share in local elections. </p> <p><strong> Dirty tricks </strong></p> <p> Wangari Maathai, Nobel peace prize-winning tree planter, has stated yet again that Aids/HIV is a product of western biological warfare. Where does she get such ideas from? A reader of AgBioView, a pro-GM website, writes: \"It began with a disinformation campaign of the SED [the East German Communist party]. It was later used as a fact by the Stasi security service and the Soviet KGB in a disinformation campaign aimed at Africa. Later, Gorbachev apologised to the US for this dirty campaign.\" Perhaps Maathai knows something else, though. </p> <p><strong> Seeds of doubt </strong> Monsanto and the US government claim that GM crops will not contaminate indigenous species but a report leaked to Greenpeace suggests otherwise. It's from the obscure Commission for Environmental Cooperation of the North American Free Trade Agreement and it recommends that all GM maize imports from the US to Mexico should be milled on entry to stop seeds being planted, intentionally or accidentally. Surprise, surprise: the Bush administration has suppressed the report for three months. </p> <p><strong> GM clone </strong> Good to know that the Democrats' presidential contender, John Kerry, is a firm supporter of GM. \"I will push for the acceptance of safe agricultural products in the US and around the world,\" he says. \"The Europeans and other countries should not use this as a pretext to unfairly close their markets to US exports.\"</p>",
  "<p>Real men wear pink. Not fuchsia or acid pinks - \"the equivalent of wearing a loud Hawaiian shirt\" - but \"your old-fashioned Wall's strawberry ice-cream colour\", according to Jo Adams in the <strong>Observer</strong>. </p> <p>Any item of pink clothing is fair game for the fashion-conscious male if he adheres to a few simple rules, Adams advised. \"Avoid ending up like a City boy trying to do casual; never go near the combination of ruffles and pink; keep it classic and simple.\" </p> <p>Jude Law's Alfie has made it acceptable to display masculinity with this traditionally feminine colour. Indeed, the <strong> Daily Telegraph</strong>'s Jim White was so taken with Law's wardrobe in the cinematic remake that he took the plunge himself and \"walked down the street in warm tones of freshly boiled lobster\". </p> <p>Of course, it happened first in America. Over the pond, men everywhere are head to toe in pink, claimed Tanika White in the <strong> Philadelphia Inquirer</strong>: \"Rappers, politicians, business types, inner-city boys on the bus - all dressed in bubble gum, cotton candy, sunset pinks.\" Even presidential hopeful John Kerry \"has been spotted in pink ties\". </p> <p>The \"carefree colour\" has made its way to coats and boots, too, and pink trainers are \"so hot\" that men have been spotted \"standing in line to buy women's shoes\", reported Nara Schoenberg in the <strong> Chicago Tribune</strong>. But why now? \"Uneasy times call for upbeat colours,\" Schoenberg mused. </p> <p>Pink was spearheaded in the US by hip-hop artists, said the New York <strong> Daily News</strong>. But it is Harlem rapper Cam'ron Giles who deserves particular credit. He went further than most by sporting \"a pink cell phone\" and \"a pink Range Rover\". </p> <p>Yet the pink tides are changing just as soon as they have arrived on our shores. Cam'ron declared himself \"over\" the colour in the <strong> New York Times</strong> last week. \"He wants to move on,\" reported Jon Caramanica, and \"plans to adopt a new colour\". Although Cam'ron was \"cagey\" about what that would be, Caramanica judged it was possible to make \"an educated guess\": his new album, released in December, is called Purple Haze.</p>"
