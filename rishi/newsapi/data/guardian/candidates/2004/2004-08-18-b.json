  "It is billed as \"the loveliest castle in the world\", a moated, fairytale concoction where black swans swim in formation and Cliff Richard and Donny Osmond play live at sunset. But as Chinook helicopters swooped over the duck pond at Leeds Castle in Kent this week, corridors hung with military paraphernalia from centuries ago were being readied for an exasperated Tony Blair's latest drive to secure the Northern Ireland peace process. <p>Next month Mr Blair will bring the Irish prime minister, Bertie Ahern, and Northern Ireland's polarised political parties to the romantic castle near Maidstone in an attempt to thrash out the deal of all deals to restore devolution. If he gets it right he will have rescued his greatest legacy - the Good Friday agreement - and begun to repair his tarnished reputation. </p> <p>Mr Blair's love of symbolism - his awareness of history and his own place in it - could not be more obvious in his choice of location for the three-day talks. The castle's sumptuous boudoir-turned-seminar room was the scene of 1978 negotiations between Egypt, Israel and the US which led to the historic Camp David agreement. </p> <p>But while Israeli flags flap on loyalist streets in Belfast and Palestinian flags hang on the nationalist Falls Road, marking the old sectarian divisions, Mr Blair is aiming for a once unthinkable political arrangement. Ian Paisley's hardline Democratic Unionist party, the biggest party in Northern Ireland, must sit down in a power-sharing government with the biggest nationalist party, Sinn F\u00e9in, if the peace process is to move forward. </p> <p><b> Ambiguity</b><br> </p> <p>The DUP will not negotiate directly with Sinn F\u00e9in until the IRA is disbanded as a paramilitary force. Indeed, there will be no direct talks between the two parties in the castle's narrow, panelled rooms. Observers have spoken of an \"outside chance\" of progress. </p> <p>But the Sinn F\u00e9in president, Gerry Adams, has stolen the thunder in recent weeks by indicating that the IRA could disband. Mr Adams has spoken before of taking the gun out of Irish politics, but he is a master of ambiguity. This time, political commentators felt he was sending the clearest signal yet that he was preparing his supporters for the day the IRA might leave the stage. He appeared to be saying goodbye to what some see as the cherished republican strategy of the Armalite in one hand and the ballot box in the other. </p> <p>Mr Adams said unionist politicians were exploiting \"justifiable fears\" about the IRA and using them as an \"excuse\" not to share power with Sinn F\u00e9in. \"I think that republicans need to be prepared to remove that as an excuse,\" he told the Irish state broadcaster, RTE. Mr Adams said any progress hinged on devolving powers over Northern Ireland's reformed police service from London to Belfast. He said the army in Northern Ireland - currently numbering more troops than in Iraq - must be scaled back, the government must stop \"protecting\" human rights abusers, and on-the-run republicans should be allowed to return home. </p> <p>As all parties prepared their positions for the talks this week, the DUP's deputy leader, Peter Robinson, has played down chances of a quick deal, saying he needs to \"weigh the semtex\" and not Gerry Adams's words. He ruled out devolving policing powers in the near future. While nationalists want the implementation of the Good Friday agreement, the DUP seeks to scrap the agreement and start again. </p> <p>Mr Blair has threatened to dissolve the Stormont assembly if no agreement is reached in September. Anniversaries are creeping up on him. It is 10 years since the first IRA ceasefire. Stormont has lain empty for almost two years since it was suspended after allegations of an IRA spy ring. It is almost a year since the assembly elections polarised Northern Ireland politics, with the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in doing their best to kill off the middle ground. </p> <p>But Jeffrey Donaldson, the DUP MP for Lagan Valley, has been appearing on platforms all summer making speeches that suggest a deal is possible - first in his address to a field of Orangemen on July 12, then on a platform with Sinn F\u00e9in's Martin McGuinness across the border in Donegal. Last week he ignored security advice and attended a public meeting in west Belfast. With Gerry Adams in the audience, he said that if the impasse in the peace process was to be broken, IRA decommissioning would have to be completed within a defined timescale. Ideally it would happen before Christmas, he said. </p> <p>Meanwhile, locals in the heart of Ann Widdecombe's Tory constituency were bemused by the choice of venue for the talks. </p> <p>One retired businessman from Ashford said locals might picket the talks, insisting the prime minister returns to \"more pressing issues\", such as asylum seekers. </p> <p>Deirdre Diggins, assistant manager of the pub next door to the castle, was from Kerry. She sighed: \"Even if they do make a deal, what's it going to change exactly? We will have to see proof it will work.\" </p> <p>Leeds Castle's prized collection of antique dog collars might strike fear into the DUP, which is adamant it will not be led by the neck into government with \"terrorists\". The ivory carving of Augustus the Strong's overfed whippet might symbolise the \u00a336.6m spent on Stormont since its suspension, infuriating voters. </p> <p>But Leeds Castle, for all its beauty, is largely fake: a confection of mock Tudor courtyards and hidden staircases. The one thing Northern Ireland parties do not want is a short-term mocked-up deal that will collapse in six months. The Stormont assembly has already been suspended four times. A dangerous scenario, said David Ford of the Alliance party, was a \"simple quick fix\" to rush the DUP and Sinn F\u00e9in into government together.</p>",
  "<p>I like comedy with ambition, and saving the world is as ambitious as it gets. Such is the goal that John Oliver and Andy Zaltzman have teamed up to achieve. If the news pages this morning suggest that they've failed, that may be because the duo don't apply any great passion to their task. Their stock-in-trade is the kind of urbane wit that we associate with their regular employer, Radio 4. You sense that they'd treat Armageddon and Nirvana with the same arched eyebrow. But their jokes are as intelligent as they come. </p> <p>Oliver and Zaltzman are better writers than performers, and their tag-team relationship here can seem slightly stilted. But there are some expressive set pieces. I may not agree that public opinion is as rightwing as they portray it, but Zaltzman ruthlessly spoofs the kind of politician who adapts his speech, phrase by phrase, to reflect the vox populi. </p> <p>There's a persuasive simplicity, too, to the advice Oliver and Zaltzman finally offer to those engaged in the petty conflicts afflicting the world. \"It was ages ago!\" says Zaltzman. \"Whatever it was, it was fucking ages ago!\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Until August 30.

  "Welcome to the Backbencher, Guardian Unlimited's weekly insider's guide to politics. <p><b>FROM AN EMPTY WESTMINSTER</b></p> <p>The Guardian's political editor Michael White looks at the implications of a poll suggesting that the NHS - not Iraq - is still the number one issue for voters.</p> <p>\"I'm sitting in a very quiet mid-August Westminster mulling over this morning's Guardian/ICM poll. It's a salutary reminder to politicians who are very concerned about Iraq that voters tend not to share their view.</p> <p>\"In fact, it was tenth out of 10 in the priorities of 1,005 voters questioned on the phone last weekend. It's worth stressing that Labour voters and Conservative voters are equally unmoved by the subject, though Lib Dems rank it seventh. </p> <p>\"The number one issue for all of them - no prizes for guessing - is the NHS, rated first by 59% of all voters. Everyone except the Conservative supporters put education second (the Tories choose 'tax and spend') and, interestingly, everyone puts 'law and order' third.</p> <p>\"So just a reminder that Iraq doesn't loom as large in the minds of most voters as it does, perhaps, to Labour-supporting broadsheet readers. But even that has to be qualified, because the poll says 12% of voters say Iraq is a 'crucial' issue for them in deciding who to support at the next election. Well, you may say 12% isn't a lot, but it could certainly make a big difference in an election. Those people who do care about Iraq certainly care a great deal.</p> <p>\"The EU and its proposed constitution, which is another issue looming large for all political leaders across the Union, is not rated so highly among ordinary voters as it is among party activists - particularly Tory ones. Another reminder that voters are often more interested in domestic bread-and-butter issues than those that get the political class excited.</p> <p>\"One wider point arising from the Guardian poll is that the Tories are up three points at 33%. They've been flatlining at around 30% for months now: Michael Howard has been impressing people at Westminster because he's a highly professional and intelligent leader but he hasn't really made a breakthrough with the voters. I think people probably feel he's a credible leader of the Tories and a man who could run the country but they are not particularly attracted to what the party is saying - although the Tories are working very hard this month. They have a policy coming out pretty much every day. Yesterday it was better use of bus lanes, today it's allowing companies to sue the government over excessive EU red tape.</p> <p>\"So the Tories have been busy, and they have a three-point gain to show for it. They seem to have scored them off the Lib Dems and the minor parties who have inevitably faded from view since the European and local elections in June. The main casualty was Ukip, whose share fell from 4% in the June Guardian/ICM poll to less than 1% this month. Ukip, let's not forget, eclipsed the BNP as a rightwing alternative vote for Tories who are a bit despairing of the official opposition at the moment. </p> <p>\"The Lib Dems are down a little on 22%, but Charles Kennedy will be pleased with that as its much higher than his party was polling at a comparable point in the last parliament and it's a pretty good base for a third party to go into an election. Mr Kennedy is hoping to benefit considerably from those Labour voters who do believe Iraq is the touchstone issue. Lots to play for. We'll have to see what the conference season brings.\"</p> <p><b> MIND YOUR OWN BLUNKETT</b></p> <p>Now, if any readers were under the impression that the Backbencher might seek to make any capital out of the home secretary's alleged [words omitted], they would be quite wrong. As yesterday's excellent Guardian editorial <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/leaders/story/0,,1284407,00.html\">points out</a>, the Sun's interest in Mr Blunkett's private life is voyeuristic, none of our business and has no bearing on his ability to do his job. Indeed, for all the criticisms of the home secretary's approach to privacy - of which more below - it's worth noting that he legislated against voyeurism in a bill too racy to be mentioned by name here. ID cards? Bring 'em on. Peeping through keyholes? Go straight to jail. And with that, the Backbencher is moving on.</p> <p><b> LAST FORTNIGHT'S COMPETITION</b></p> <p>Unfortunately, however, the theme of her last competition drags her - much against her will - back to Mr Blunkett and privacy. She had asked readers to identify the three freedoms the home secretary believes the introduction of ID cards will help to protect.</p> <p>Some readers are clearly unfamiliar with the New Labour approach to public services. \"Employment, free health service, claim benefits,\" wrote a Nottingham University student. Carl, it's a touching suggestion, but you may find the months after graduation are tougher than you thought. \"I like the idea of people scanning my eyes, though,\" he added, a remark that caused the Backbencher to whimper aloud. She also received an entry from a precocious Minneapolis high school student. \"I am writing a paper on the 1945 general election and subsequent Labour government for my IB extended essay,\" writes Evan, who claims to be able to \"distinguish Nye Bevan from Ernest Bevin\". The book's in the post, young man, and the Backbencher will see you on your Fulbright.</p> <p>The other winner is Mark Pryce, who sent a delightful email from the Hague pointing out that the Dutch presidency of the EU, backed by Britain, is about to table legislation obliging telephone and internet ISPs to store their traffic records.</p> <p>And those freedoms Mr Blunkett prizes? \"The freedom to live without being exploited, to prove quickly and decisively who we are, and to travel freely.\" You can run, citizens. But you can't hide.</p> <p><b> THIS WEEK'S COMPETITION</b></p> <p>One of the Backbencher's colleagues has kindly passed on a US president's first work of fiction for her to give away. No, it's not Bill's memoirs - she wouldn't make a cheap gag like that. It's Jimmy Carter's magnificent Civil War novel, The Hornet's Nest, published by <a href=\"http://www.simonsays.co.uk\">Simon and Schuster</a>.</p> <p>Of course, there's an element of fighting, tragedy and smallpox, but the Nobel Peace prizewinner can still do romantic: \"She was surprised by his passion, and thankful that she could help relieve his torment...\" To win it, just tell the Backbencher what John Prescott has been up to today (Wednesday).

  "Israel announced plans for 1,000 houses in the West Bank yesterday, accelerating the expansion of the settlements. <p>The pace of construction is in marked contrast to the slow pace of its much-publicised withdrawal from the settlements in the Gaza Strip. </p> <p>Peace Now, an Israeli group opposed to the settlements, said a minimum of 3,700 houses were being built, in addition to 600 announced earlier this month and the 1,000 yesterday. </p> <p>Earlier this month the Guardian revealed that big infrastructure projects were under way to prepare for a new settlement to link Ma'ale Adumim and Jerusalem, enclosing Palestinian east Jerusalem. </p> <p>The announcement came on the eve of a meeting of Ariel Sharon's Likud party, whose right wing is hostile to the prime minister's plan to abandon Jewish settlements in Gaza. </p> <p>Mr Sharon is attempting the difficult balancing act of moving ahead with the Gaza plan while holding together his coalition government. </p> <p>Yariv Oppenheimer, of Peace Now, said Mr Sharon was talking of disengagement from Gaza but doing nothing, while increasing the occupation of Palestinian territory in the West Bank. </p> <p>The total of 5,300 houses in the present wave of settlement expansion constitutes almost a house each for about 7,000 settlers who live in the Gaza Strip. </p> <p>Mr Sharon said the Gaza Strip would be clear of Jewish settlements by the end of next year. Eighty families have already submitted their claims for compensation. </p> <p>The road map peace plan, which was endorsed by Israel and the US in June last year, calls for all settlement activity to be frozen. But it is being ignored by Jerusalem and Washington. </p> <p>A western diplomat said that Israel had never accepted limits on settlements and Washington had never insisted on them. </p> <p>\"The US tacitly agreed, via the exchange of letters and other meetings, that the Israeli position has validity,\" the diplomat said. </p> <p>\"The US showed that limited building was permissible. However, it is not clear that this scale of building is consistent with that understanding.\" </p> <p>Other sources said President George Bush would not confront Israel in the run-up to the presidential election, but would not take kindly to Mr Sharon taking advantage of this situation. </p> <p>Although the road map was formulated by the UN with the help of the EU and Russia, Israel has tried to ensure that it negotiates only with the US. </p> <p>It has also reneged on undertakings to dismantle more than 100 illegal outposts in the West Bank, some of which consist of a few caravans. </p> <p>Paul Patin, a US embassy official, said yesterday that a US delegation would visit Israel's unauthorised settlement outposts in the West Bank to push for their removal. </p> <p>\"Israel has accepted the road map and we expect them to honour their commitments. Having said that, it is now August 2004 and the commitments were made in June 2003,\" he said. </p> <p>In Washington a state department spokesman, Adam Ereli, said last night: \"Our concern is to determine whether these tenders are consistent with Israel's commitments [to freeze settlements].\" </p> <p>The Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz described Mr Sharon's failure to dismantle the outposts as \"pathetic and shameful\". </p> <p>Kobi Beich, a spokesman for the housing ministry, said all the 1,001 housing units whose construction was announced yesterday were within the boundaries of existing settlements. The boundaries are drawn to allow for expansion. </p> <p>A spokesman for the Palestinian Authority president ,Yasser Arafat, denounced the plans and asked the international community to intervene.</p>"
