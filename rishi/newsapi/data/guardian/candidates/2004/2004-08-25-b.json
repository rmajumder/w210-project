  "Russian investigators today said they had found no evidence that terrorists were to blame for the near simultaneous crashes of two passenger planes last night. <p>The two aircraft, which had taken off from Moscow's Domodedovo airport, disappeared from radar screens within four minutes of each other at around 11pm (1900 GMT) yesterday. </p> <p>One plane crashed, while another apparently broke up in mid-air, killing a total of 89 passengers and crew members.</p> <p>Security was stepped up at Russian airports as experts voiced fears that the loss of two aircraft from the same airport at almost the same time must be more than a terrible accident. One of the planes had reportedly issued a hijack warning before it disappeared from radar. </p> <p>The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, ordered the Federal security service (FSB) to investigate - something it is normally only asked to do when terrorism is suspected. </p> <p>However, later in the day the FSB said studies of the wreckage had revealed no evidence of terrorism. Investigators had recovered black box recordings from both planes by this morning, and the FSB said it was looking at other possible causes such as technical failures, the use of poor quality fuel, breaches of fuelling regulations and pilot error.</p> <p>The airlines that had operated the two lost planes rejected the possibility of human or technical faults, saying the aircraft were properly checked before the flights and had experienced crews.</p> <p>Authorities said rescuers had found wreckage from one of the planes, a Tu-154 jet that had been on its way to the Black Sea resort of Sochi, around nine hours after it had disappeared from radar screens 600 miles south of Moscow over the Rostov region. The Sibir Airlines flight had been carrying 46 passengers. 'We are considering an act of terror as one possibility, especially after we received an automatically generated telegram from the Sochi air control centre that the plane had been hijacked,' an airline spokesman said earlier. </p> <p>Officials, however, seemed unsure whether the signal indicated a hijacking or another severe problem on the aircraft. </p> <p>At around the same time the Sibir flight vanished, a Tu-134 aircraft carrying 43 people crashed in the Tula region, around 125 miles south of Moscow, officials said. The emergency situations ministry later said everybody on board had been killed. The Volga-Aviaexpress flight had been travelling to the southern city of Volgograd.</p> <p>Suspicion immediately centred on Chechen rebels. Russian authorities had expressed concern that Chechen separatists could carry out attacks linked to this Sunday's presidential election, and rebels have been blamed for a series of terror strikes that have claimed hundreds of lives in Russia over recent years. </p> <p>Moderate Chechen separatists, however, denied any role in the crashes. \"Our government has nothing to do with terrorist attacks. Our attacks only target the military,\" Farouq Tubulat, a spokesman for the Chechen separatist leader Aslan Maskhadov, told al-Jazeera television.</p> <p>\"This is part of the Russian propaganda plan to besmirch the struggle of the Chechen people.\"</p> <p>Officials said the crew of the Volga-Aviaexpress flight had given no indication that anything was wrong, but witnesses on the ground reported hearing a series of explosions. </p> <p>Emergency workers reported seeing a fire in the Rostov region where the Tu-154 went missing. However, search efforts were hampered by rainy weather, and it was hours before the wreckage was found. </p> <p>The emergency situations ministry's regional chief in Rostov, Viktor Shkareda, said the plane had apparently broken up in the air, with wreckage strewn over an area of around 25 to 30 miles. Body parts were said to have been discovered along with fragments of the plane near Gluboky, a village north of the regional capital, Rostov-on-Don. </p> <p>In the Tula region, rescuers found the Tu-134 jet's wreckage in a field. It was broken into two parts with the fuselage upside down and severed from the tail. </p> <p>Nikolai Gorokhov, a local resident who was at home at the time of the crash, said: \"There were three loud bangs on the window, like someone knocking.\"</p>",

  "The US vice president, Dick Cheney, yesterday spoke supportively about gay relationships, saying: \"Freedom means freedom for everyone.\" <p>Mr Cheney made the remarks at a campaign rally in the Mississippi river town of Davenport, Iowa, where he was speaking to an audience that included his lesbian daughter, Mary.</p> <p>He said that, while he did not personally support a constitutional amendment against gay marriage, he accepted the decision of the US president, George Bush, to pursue it as administration policy.</p> <p>\"[My wife] Lynne and I have a gay daughter, so it's an issue our family is very familiar with,\" Mr Cheney said. </p> <p>\"With respect to the question of relationships, my general view is freedom means freedom for everyone ... people ought to be free to enter into any kind of relationship they want to,\" he added. </p> <p>\"The question that comes up with the issue of marriage is what kind of official sanction or approval is going to be granted by government? Historically, that's been a relationship that has been handled by the states. The states have made that fundamental decision of what constitutes a marriage.\"</p> <p>Mr Bush's backing of a constitutional amendment prohibiting gay marriage was a move Mr Cheney said had been prompted by various judicial rulings that had made gay marriage legal.</p> <p>The president backed a ban after the Massachusetts supreme court ruled, in February this year, that homosexual couples had the right to marry. However, the ban was defeated in the US Senate when Republican politicians broke party ranks to join Democrats in opposing it.</p> <p>\"I think his perception was that the courts, in effect, were beginning to change, without allowing the people to be involved,\" Mr Cheney said. \"The courts were making the judgment for the entire country.\" </p> <p>Last month, speaking just days after the Senate had blocked the ban, Lynne Cheney said states should have the final say over the legal status of personal relationships. </p> <p>The Cheneys have two daughters, both of whom are working on the campaign. Mary Cheney is the director of vice-presidential operations for the Bush-Cheney re-election campaign. She held a public role as her father's assistant in the 2000 campaign, and helped the Republicans to recruit gay voters during the 2002 mid-term elections. </p> <p>During the 2000 campaign, Mr Cheney adopted the stance that individual states should decide legal issues about personal relationships, saying people should be free to enter relationships of their choosing - a view held by many Democrats. </p> <p>The Democratic challengers in November's presidential election, senators John Kerry, of Massachusetts, and John Edwards, of North Carolina, oppose the amendment. </p> <p>They oppose gay marriage, but defend a gay couple's rights to the same legal protections as those conferred in marriage. </p> <p>Steven Fisher, spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign, a gay and lesbian group, said Mr Cheney's remarks contrasted starkly with Mr Bush's efforts \"to put discrimination in the constitution.\" </p> <p>Mr Fisher said: \"President Bush is feeling the heat. The administration has been using gay Americans to drive a wedge into the electorate. </p> <p>\"There are millions of American families who have gay family members and friends, who are offended by the president's use of discrimination.\"</p>",
  "A Russian airliner crashed and another apparently broke up in the air almost simultaneously last night, killing all 90 people on board and raising fears of terrorism. <p>Both planes, which had taken off from Moscow's Domodedovo airport, disappeared from radar screens within minutes of each other at around 11pm local time (1900 GMT). </p> <p>Federal security service experts were trying to determine whether explosions had preceded the crashes, the Interfax news agency reported. At least one of the planes - which took off within 40 minutes of each other - appeared to have issued a hijack warning before it crashed.</p> <p>The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, ordered an investigation to be carried out by the nation's main intelligence agency, the federal security service, and security was tightened at airports. By this morning, investigators had recovered black box recordings from both planes. </p> <p>Authorities said rescuers found wreckage from one of the aircraft, a Tu-154 jet that had been en route to the Black Sea resort of Sochi, around nine hours after it had disappeared from radar screens over the Rostov region, around 600 miles south of Moscow.

The Volga-Aviaexpress flight had been travelling to the southern city of Volgograd.</p> <p>\"The fact that both planes took off from one airport and disappeared from radars around the same time can show it was a planned action.

It could be triggered during a hijacking or a potentially catastrophic technical problem. </p> <p>Interfax said emergency workers had seen a fire in the Rostov region where the Tu-154 went missing. However, rainy weather hampered search efforts, and it was hours before any wreckage was found. A flight data recorder was recovered, Sergei Shoigu, the emergency situations minister, said, according to Interfax.</p> <p>The ministry's regional chief in Rostov, Viktor Shkareda, said the plane had apparently broken up in the air, with wreckage strewn over an area of around 25 to 30 miles. </p> <p>Body parts had been found along with fragments of the plane, Interfax reported.

Its fuselage lay upside down, severed from the tail. Interfax, citing the emergency ministry, said one of that jet's flight data recorders had been found. </p> <p>Nikolai Gorokhov, a local resident who was at home at the time of the crash said, \"There were three loud bangs on the window, like someone knocking.\"</p> <p>Interfax quoted a Domodedovo airport spokesman as saying there had been no foreigners on the passenger lists for either plane.</p>",
  "<p>The sudden death of Professor John Clark, at the age of 52, has robbed Britain of a world leader in animal science and biotechnology, and an individual whose commitment to science was based on a genuine concern for others. A visionary, energetic and resolute leader, he made outstanding contributions not only in research, but also in translating it to the commercial environment. </p> <p>Clark was director of the Roslin Institute, near Edinburgh, one of the world's leading centres for research on farm and other animals, funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Science Council. He pioneered the development of techniques for the genetic modification of livestock that led to the cloning techniques and the birth, in 1996, of Dolly the sheep, the first animal to be cloned from an adult cell. This event created entirely new opportunities in research and regenerative medicine. </p> <p>Appointed to the then Animal Breeding Research Organisation in 1985, Clark soon assumed leadership of a project to produce human proteins in the milk of sheep. Its success required an understanding of the mechanisms that regulate the functioning of genes, the technical ability to manipulate DNA sequences and methods for the introduction of gene sequences into sheep embryos. While these are now commonplace, this was not the case at the time, and the project was technically challenging. </p> <p>The birth, in 1990, of Tracy, the first sheep to produce very large quantities of human protein in her milk - alpha-1-antitrypsin for the treatment of cystic fibrosis - was a milestone in the field, and a success that laid the foundation for the continuing reputation of the Roslin Institute (as it became in 1993) as pioneers in transgenic technology. </p> <p>The development of cloning techniques at Roslin in the mid-1990s provided the first opportunity to introduce precise genetic changes in animals other than mice, and Clark and his colleagues were the first to produce a large animal from which a specific gene had been removed (a prion protein gene from a sheep). </p> <p>Characteristically quick to recognise scientific opportunities, Clark responded to the news, in 1997, of the isolation of the first human embryonic stem cells by rapidly establishing his own projects building on that research. Currently, the laboratory he managed is working on the derivation of liver cells and neurones from human embryonic stem cells for potential use in the testing of new drugs and the treatment of Parkinson's disease, stroke and spinal cord injury. </p> <p>Scientists in the UK are often criticised for failing to convert scientific advances into practical benefit. Clark was an exception in that he had a clear commitment to commercialising research - and the entrepreneurial flair to achieve this. The successful project to produce human proteins in sheep milk was carried out at Roslin, but provided the intellectual basis for the establishment of PPL Therapeutics in 1987. Clark's experience with the creation of that company was invaluable when Dolly followed. </p> <p>The establishment of another company, Roslin BioMed, and its subsequent acquisition by the US Geron Corporation in 1999, delivered a six-year commitment to fund human stem cell research at the institute, and has underpinned its status as a leader in this exciting new field. </p> <p>Most of Clark's career was driven by setting a strategy in which possible applications provided the rationale and justification for research. Thus, he was ideally suited to provide the scientific leadership and direction when he became director of Roslin on August 1 2003. Irrespective of the level at which he was operating, from team leader to director, he always ensured he had time for his staff, especially for the many students he personally supervised. </p> <p>Clark was born in Blackpool, but the family moved to Lincolnshire, where he was educated at Barton grammar school. After he graduated in natural sciences at Christ's College, Cambridge, in 1973, he and his wife Helen began what they later called their \"world tour\". First, they went to the University of Western Ontario, Canada, where Clark obtained an MSc for studies on the regulation of development in a mudsnail. </p> <p>They then travelled for a year through the US and South America. This experience had a lasting impact on Clark, and he could always amaze with anecdotes of their many adventures, such as horseback journeys to visit remote archaeological sites in the Colombian rainforest. </p> <p>Back in Britain, Clark began research in what were still the very early days of molecular biology. Working in Edinburgh, he completed a pioneering study on human satellite DNA, for which he was awarded a PhD in 1982, before working, with John Bishop, of the Institute of Genetics at Edinburgh University, on genes that function in the liver of mice </p> <p>Clark was awarded the OBE in 1997, elected a fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1999, and was a valued contributor to numerous scientific committees and working groups. A widely read man, he enjoyed music, dancing and a broad circle of friends. </p> <p>Though he, Helen and his two sons, Charlie and Laurie, travelled widely together, they returned repeatedly to the tranquillity of Colonsay, in the Inner Hebrides. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Anthony John Clark, scientist and entrepreneur, born September 18 1951; died August 12 2004</p>",
  "There was only one message on the banners and posters dotted around Islamabad's streets as the motorcade whizzed past amid tight security: \"Pakistan welcomes Hamid Karzai\". But the warm greeting belied the sensitivity of the moment for the interim Afghan leader and his host, President Pervez Musharraf. <p>Mr Karzai is worried about Taliban insurgents, who are threatening to upset next month's presidential elections. Many are thought to use Pakistan as a base. General Musharraf offered his unqualified help. \"Anybody trying to disrupt the election process ... will not be allowed from Pakistan. We will act against them,\" he vowed. </p> <p>These days Gen Musharraf's promises carry extra weight, following a six-week drive against al-Qaida in Pakistan. From the back-streets of Karachi to the tribal highlands, his security services have prosecuted an unrelenting campaign against Osama bin Laden's network. </p> <p>Hardly a day passes without the announcement of fresh arrests, foiled bomb plots, or military operations along the Afghan border. So far the security services - invigorated by a wave of suicide attacks on government and army figures - have detained over 70 suspected militants. They include Ahmad Khalfan Ghailani, a Tanzanian wanted in connection with the 1998 US embassy bombings in east Africa, and Mohammed Naeem Noor Khan, a Pakistani computer expert whose plans for new attacks sparked alerts in London, New York and New Jersey. </p> <p>Britain and the US are delighted with the sweep, which has burnished Gen Musharraf's standing as a central strategic ally. But they also admit that beneath the successes of the Pakistani army lies an underbelly rooted in its long-standing links with Islamic extremism. Many of the suspects being rounded up were originally recruited by the ISI, the army's intelligence service, to fight in Kashmir or Afghanistan in the 1980s and 1990s. Now cut adrift from Pakistan, many have found a calling in al-Qaida. It is unclear whether some of their handlers have gone with them. \"It's great having a savage dog that attacks other people,\" said a diplomat, \"but not if it turns on you.\" </p> <p>In the past week suspected hideouts have been bombed in the mountains and forests of South Waziristan, where militants are sheltering under the protection of tribesmen. There is also frequent speculation that Bin Laden or his deputy, Ayman al-Zawahri, are hiding in the same area. </p> <p>Last week Gen Musharraf's government published a \"wanted\" poster for its six most wanted militants, offering rewards of up to $340,000 per head. The highest price was offered for Abu Faraj Farj, a Libyan, who is suspected to have coordinated much al-Qaida activity in Pakistan. </p> <p>The hunt for suspects appears to have encouraged police brutality. Last week a radical cleric, Qari Noor Mohammed, died in custody after a raid on an Islamic school in Faisalabad. Police said Mr Mohammed suffered a heart attack; human rights activists said he had been tortured. </p> <p>In response, al-Qaida has transformed its tactics. Having long considered Pakistan as a rear base, it has now turned its sights on the violent overthrow of the Pakistani state. In the past year suicide bombers have nearly succeeded in killing Gen Musharraf, an army commander, and Shaukat Aziz, due to be appointed prime minister this week. Last weekend the security services claimed they had foiled a plot to blow up the national convention centre, Gen Musharraf's house and the US embassy. </p> <p>But although outsiders are thought to have coordinated the terror operations, Pakistani militants have provided the manpower. Many are drawn from radical Islamic groups once nurtured by the ISI. They include Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, a sectarian Sunni group that fought alongside the Taliban in Afghanistan, and Harkatul Mujahideen, which has supported the Pakistan army in its war with India. </p> <p>Not only have the militants turned against the Pakistani state, but diplomats worry that some of their handlers - mid- to low-level intelligence operatives - have not shed all their ties. \"There's a lot of dirty laundry,\" said one. \"If you have spent 15 years running Jihadis in Kashmir and Afghanistan, and then one day someone tells you to stop - it's very difficult.\" </p> <p>The army denies any such fissures persist. \"This is a professional army where orders are followed. Anyone who refuses to do so will get his ass kicked,\" said Major General Shaukat Sultan. </p> <p>Analysts say the army is struggling with the product of its longstanding association with Islamists. \"I think we are reaping what we sowed in the 1970s and 1980s,\" said Talat Masood, a retired general. \"The process of the militarisation of society, strengthening the forces of radicalism - has come back to haunt us. </p> <p>The militants are also being drawn from less traditional strands. In contrast with the Islamists, who mainly come from poor backgrounds, computer expert Mohammed Naeem Noor Khan was a qualified engineer from a middle class Karachi family who had studied at City University, London.</p>",
  "<p>Turn to the Guardian's university clearing pages and there are many vacancies for a subject that was once hugely popular. Until recently, American studies departments sprang up everywhere. But no longer. </p> <p>Now 28 universities still have American studies places unfilled, and they include many at well-regarded institutions - Essex, Keele, Kent and Swansea among them. Due to lack of demand, five universities have closed American studies departments while others have cut staff. Keele, traditionally the top-ranking American studies department, with a maximum, grade five ranking for research for the past few years, has had to fire half its staff. Professor Ian Bell at Keele says: \"Students don't want to be branded by doing American studies. They still want to do American modules as part of English or history but, after Bush, they shy away from being labelled as pro-American - not after the obscenity of Iraq.\" </p> <p>It's only a straw in the wind: student choices are notoriously fickle. But it fits the picture of a groundswell of anti-American feeling. Where in the world could you walk down the street and not collect overwhelmingly negative vox pops on Bush's America and its global impact? Last year's BBC/ICM poll, taken in a string of countries across the continents, found only Israel in support of Bush - with Canada, Australia and Korea least unfavourable, but still with a majority against. </p> <p>That is not necessarily the same as anti-Americanism. The Bushites in their daily, foul-mouthed email assaults on Guardian writers try to portray current anti-American sentiment as racist, akin to anti-semitic. They try to pretend \"old\" Europe is just effetely snobbish about the Ugly Americans. They dismiss anti-Bush disgust in developing countries as envy and as ignorant support for terror. </p> <p>But opinion polls make it clear that people are well able to separate their feelings about Americans from the politicians and policies now occupying the White House: 81% of the British say, \"I like the Americans as people\", according to Mori, but only 19% admire American society. They overwhelmingly reject the proposition \"We would be better off if we were more like the Americans in many respects\" - the view of the right and of younger Tories infatuated with US neo-conservatism. </p> <p>How much wider the Atlantic has grown under Bush. A Mori poll for the German Marshall Fund examined European attitudes towards America. It found massive condemnation of US Middle East policy (among the British just as strongly) and equally strong opprobrium for US policies on global warming and nuclear proliferation. Most Europeans - the British too - want the European Union to become a superpower to match the US, with a strong leadership in world affairs. (Americans said they wanted to be the only superpower.) Yet there was also surprisingly strong support among two-thirds of Europeans for strengthening Nato - even in France. </p> <p>However, President Bush's election pledge this week to withdraw 70,000 troops from Germany and Korea may bring an abrupt end to Europe's old doublethink on Nato. If the troops go, it may force Europe to confront the hypocrisy of detesting America while relying on it to provide the defence European nations refuse to pay for. The Bushite emailers are justified in sneering, \"We pulled your sorry asses out of two world wars\" (the printable version), and it's just as well Fox News hasn't covered celebrations in Paris this week that pretend France liberated itself, with never a mention of Europe's American saviours. </p> <p>If a Bush victory brings a major withdrawal from Europe, it should prod the EU into coordinating its defence capability, without having to beg the US for a transport plane to mount every tiny border peacekeeping operation in Macedonia. If the EU starts to put its still considerable defence spending to better collective use, Bush won't like it: his ministers protested when Blair and Chirac began the task. </p> <p>If Bush wins it may galvanise Europe into a stronger sense of what it must do in response. Forget Blair's phantom \"bridge\" across the Atlantic, and start building across the Channel. (Sadly there has been no growth in university applications to read European studies or languages.) </p> <p>The world waits on the US elections with particular trepidation this time. The fall of the Berlin wall was a great opportunity missed for America the victor to become the global force for good it thinks it is. The fall of the twin towers was a chance to reclaim that lost global respect, but in every action Bush has swelled the ranks of those who cheered in the streets when it happened. </p> <p>ICM's poll reveals a world that thinks America arrogant, less cultured, a worse place to live than their own countries and a threat to world peace. Is that hatred now irreversibly hardwired? </p> <p>A Kerry win might still do much to heal the rift, just by showing America publicly renouncing Bush and all his works. Peering into Kerry's muddy campaign messages, it is unclear whether the man can be far-sighted, brave and decisive. On Nato troops, for example, he first said he would consider withdrawing them, then said it was a mistake, then that it should be done but more slowly. </p> <p>The insane necessities of a presidential campaign make it impossible to know what manner of president will emerge at the end, but if Kerry does indeed make it his mission to repair America's global standing, he will have a brief window of global goodwill in which to try his best. </p> <p>The underlying picture of attitudes towards America suggests a miasma of confusion and deep emotion: the idea of America is woven deep into the universal imagination. When prompted, the world can also admit to seeing the US as that beacon of liberty and opportunity that Americans dream themselves to be. </p> <p>Hardly a child born can avoid drinking in the great American myth from those Disney realms where the simple, humble and virtuous win through every time against the rich, corrupt and greedy. How is that self-image squared with the monster the world perceives? The old Hollywood morality tales from Shane and It's a Wonderful Life still spin out into Spiderman or I, Robot, celebrating the little guy who beats the monster corporation. Homespun American goodness warring with the cruelties of raw capitalism is the dominant Hollywood theme, yet little of this culture enters the US political bloodstream. </p> <p>Between the American ideal and the American reality falls the longest shadow. Discuss. It's well worth more study. If John Kerry wins and sets about repairing the damage Bush has done, it may get American studies flourishing again - and stem the global tide of anti-Americanism. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:p.toynbee@theguardian.com\">p.toynbee@theguardian.com</a></p>"
