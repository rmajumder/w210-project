  "Come August and the Indonesian papers face the same difficulties as those in Britain: deciding what constitutes news when little is happening. The result is that every paper has been splashing with different stories, as demonstrated by yesterday's editions. <p>\"Golkar leaders fighting for crumbs\", was the lead in <b>Rakyat Merdeka</b>, after the largest party in parliament saw its candidate defeated in the first round of the country's first direct presidential election. </p> <p>\"Hundreds of legislators-elect have problems\", was <b>Koran Tempo</b>'s preference, in an article that discussed the legal difficulties facing members of provincial and district councils, and the national parliament. </p> <p>\"Government sees limited oil-hike impact\", was the duller choice of the English-language <b>Jakarta Post</b>'s newly appointed editor, although that was brightened by an unrelated photo underneath of a full washing line - the country's longest, at 2.4 miles. </p> <p><b>Republika</b>, a newspaper whose owner is the campaign manager of President Megawati Sukarnoputri's closest rival in the elections, used a quiet day to have another go at Ms Megawati, accusing her and her running mate of refusing to admit accepting illegal campaign contributions. </p> <p><b>Kompas</b>, the nation's most widely read broadsheet, told its readers: \"Bosses pay for processing of Indonesian workers' documents\". The story covered the impending crackdown by Malaysian authorities on illegal foreign workers. Malaysian plantation workers are hastily \"legalising\" their workers to escape sanction. </p> <p>Perhaps the only consistent newspaper was the capital's leading tabloid, <b>City Post</b>, which stuck to its usual fare with the following: \"After angering her foster mother, young orphan girl is burnt\". The strap underneath read: \"Enraged mob try to destroy the foster home\". </p> <p>The weeklies, however, were all on the same page, playing catch-up on the previous big story, the constitutional court's decision to deem as invalid the prosecutions of the perpetrators of the Bali bombing in 2002, because they were conducted under a piece of legislation enacted after the atrocity. \"Will they go free?\" was <b>Tempo</b>'s simple headline, above photos of four of the ringleaders. </p> <p>The inside pages of the papers, too, were concentrating on some of the same stories. One is the murder of Amanda Devina, a 22-year-old student at one of Jakarta's more prestigious private universities. What made this case unique for Indonesia was the double life the woman, who had committed what is - in the eyes of many Indonesians - the sin of becoming pregnant outside marriage. She paid for it with her life. </p> <p>In a leader headlined \"Amanda is a portrait of our society\", the conservative Republika blamed the tragedy on the fact that \"our society's lifestyle is changing\". It urged the government to reflect that \"political life should not just be about power ... We want our families to be protected. We want a different world where our children are not deviating. We are in a transitional phase and our destruction at this time is the result of the negligence of those in power. Save our soul.\" </p> <p>The Jakarta Post, meanwhile, was outraged that Indonesia will be the only country competing at the Athens Olympics not broadcasting the games. In an editorial headlined \"Indonesia's Greek Tragedy\", the newspaper complained: \"We believe there is a problem of scheduling, and commercial stations are simply reluctant to sacrifice their prime-time, money-spinning reality and quiz shows for the Olympic games.\" </p> <p>Guessing that Indonesia's declining sporting fortunes in recent years could be partly to blame for the lack of broadcast interest, the newspaper continued: \"Given Indonesia's low standing in international and regional sports, our failure to broadcast the event, live or otherwise, would further undermine our national interest in sports and in our capacity to understand the age-old Olympic traditions of honouring excellence, international friendship and solidarity.\" </p> <p>Indonesia's slow season is unlikely to last much longer, however. Yesterday the government carried out its first execution in three years, of an Indian drug smuggler, and, if the TV news is anything to go by, that should dominate today's front pages.</p>",
  "<p>California is proposing to add solar power to a million homes in the next 10 years, paid for by a surcharge on consumers' electricity bills equivalent to about 15 pence a month. </p> <p>The plan, proposed by the California Environmental Protection Agency, is intended to honour the election pledge of California's governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, to ensure that half of all new homes in the state are built with solar power facilities. </p> <p>The surcharge would raise $1bn (about \u00a3570m) in 10 years for the installation programme, with the state using the money to give rebates to home builders who install solar panels on new homes, and incentives for installing panels on existing homes. </p> <p>Homeowners would be able to reduce their power bills and even make money by selling \"unused\" solar energy back to the electricity companies via two-way meters. </p> <p>Electricity supply has been a sensitive issue since the energy crisis in 2001 when a free-for-all market pushed prices so low that many stations shut down leaving the state short of power. Solar power became more popular. According to the California Energy Commission, while 900 photovoltaic systems were installed from 1998 to 2000, more than 11,000 systems were installed from 2001 to mid-2003. </p> <p>Most of the changes were to older properties, but with 150,000 new homes being built a year the greater potential led to a campaign for the state to use its \"greatest asset\" - sunshine. </p> <p>Tim Coyle, the senior vice president of the California Building Industry Association, said home solar systems could cost from $17,000-20,000 (\u00a39,714-\u00a311,428) and did not pay for themselves as customers would typically pay $120 a month to repay the purchase price and receive about $70 in \"returns\" in electricity generated. </p> <p>The state grants are designed to make the system pay. </p> <p>According to the draft plan, presented by Drew Bohan, under-secretary of the EPA, \"each month the homeowner will save more money in reduced electricity charges than [will be paid] on the solar mortgage\". </p> <p>Environmental groups said the proposal would once again make California a national trendsetter while encouraging technical advances that would help make solar power more affordable worldwide. </p> <p>\"This is so far ahead of any other state ... there's no comparison,\" said Bernadette Del Chiaro, of the group Environment California. </p> <p>Together the solar installations would equal 36 new, 75-megawatt natural gas plants, and would avoid adding 50m tons of carbon dioxide into the air annually. </p> <p>The incentives should be enough to get solar panels on 40% of new homes by 2010 and 50% by 2013, the EPA believes. The hope is that 1.2m homes will be producing solar energy by 2017, including 884,000 new and 313,000 older houses. </p> <p>Mr Schwarzenegger has yet to endorse the plan publicly, despite the election pledge. </p> <p>Ms Del Chiaro said: \"My hope is the governor comes out even stronger by increasing the incentives and mandates, and applying the requirements to commercial buildings as well. There's no guarantee builders will take advantage of incentives, though [they] are great.\" </p> <p>Many environmentalists are also backing solar home incentives. A solar incentive bill, approved by the California senate, would require 15% of new homes to be built with solar panels by 2006. By 2010 more than half of homes would come equipped with solar systems. </p> <p>The building industry opposes the solar homes bill but said the proposed incentives were the way to encourage technological and economic improvements that will make widespread use of solar energy more realistic.</p>",

Still great fun though: an assured blend of humour, suspense and romance, it stars sweet Leonardo DiCaprio as Frank the teenage fraudster, who posed as a doctor, lawyer and airline pilot to cash forged cheques during a hedonistic round trip of the States. He's impeccably supported by Christopher Walken as Frank Sr and Nathalie Baye as Mum, and Tom Hanks as the FBI man who tracked him obsessively for years.

On its release there was much media excitement about the explicit sex scenes, but Chereau, aided by courageous performances, has crafted an intriguing, serious-minded little existentialist drama. </p> <p><strong> The Big Heat</strong><br> (Fritz Lang, 1953)<br> 12.25am, Sky Cinema 1<br> A definitive film noir that books its place in cinema history with the infamous scene in which Lee Marvin's brutal gangster throws scalding coffee into Gloria Grahame's face. The world is indeed a savage place here, the protagonists trapped in the confining interiors of Charles Lang Jr's shadowy photography. But hard-boiled as it is, there is redemption for Glenn Ford's haunted cop, hunting the killers of his wife, and retribution for the scarred Grahame. </p> <p><strong> Oscar and Lucinda</strong><br>(Gillian Armstrong, 1997) <br>3.20am, FilmFour <br>A richly textured adaptation of Peter Carey's Booker prize-winning novel, set in the 19th-century Australian outback. Ralph Fiennes and Cate Blanchett are superb as Oscar, rebellious son of a stern minister and Lucinda, fiery founder of a glass factory, thrown together by their love of gambling.

  "In his Letter to the Bishops of the Catholic Church on the Collaboration of Men and Women in the Church and in the World, the Pope has taken on feminism, which most people outside universities thought dead and buried years ago. The attack, written by 77-year-old Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, to which his Frailness merely gave the nod, need not cause too much shock and horror. Anything denounced from the papal throne is instantly catapulted into the awareness of the poor in the Catholic third world, whose view of the Roman hierarchy is already profoundly disenchanted. Family planning workers in the vast slums of Catholic Latin America will tell you that whenever the Pope is known to have been inveighing against contraception, and the cry is taken up by every local pulpit, people flock to the clinics, avid for pills and IUDs. His Holiness's grief and wrath is far more effective in persuading the indigent faithful that contraception actually works than anything the family planners might say. Now that his nibs has turned his attention to feminism, oppressed women may very well begin to suspect that there must be something in it after all. <p>Bavarian Ratzinger, described by some as the Panzerkardinal, was once an academic theologian, with lamentable tendencies towards essentialism. What he says could not bind the faithful unless his Holiness agreed to ventriloquise ex cathedra, and definitely to lay down a doctrine of faith or morals. This Pope has never made an ex cathedra pronouncement and now for sure never will. Ratzinger is free, and has been free for years, to air his convictions as and when he pleases, generating sententious humbug as specious as anything spun by secular authorities. On the global scandal of sexual abuse of children by the Catholic clergy and the condonation of such abuse by the higher clergy, the Pontiff and his enforcer have remained shtoom for years, while believers left in droves and bishoprics took bankruptcy rather than pay damages. When it comes to excoriating feminism, tight-lipped Ratzinger, head of the Vatican Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith, once known as the Inquisition, allows himself to babble like an advertising copywriter. The church, run by celibates and pseudo-celibates in their own interest, is declared to be \"expert in humanity\", a claim that those of us who endured Catholic schools from the ages of four to 17 would find ludicrous. </p> <p>The Ratzinger-Wojtyla axis is worried about \"certain currents of thought which are often at variance with the authentic advancement of women\" that have arisen in \"recent years\". The \"expert in humanity\" has invoked this notion before, in 1988, with the apostolic letter Mulieris dignitatem; the main points were reiterated in the Pope's Letter to Women, issued on the occasion of the Beijing Conference of 1995. The purpose of these 10-year utterances is not to reveal new thinking on the part of the Vatican, but to rephrase the old thinking so that it appears to be a hip response to new pressures. As far as the Church is concerned, there has been no change; for women, though not for men, \"to serve is to reign\". What is new is that the papal thinktank has deliberately taken on feminism, probably because it considers that feminism is now a straw man, a sort of Iraq, enfeebled and incapable of retaliation, to be devastated with impunity. The effects on the church itself could prove disastrous. Parish priests are rapidly losing their hold over the common people, who are better educated and more sceptical than they were when Wojtyla and Ratzinger were boys. The worshippers to be found in parish churches are mostly female and mostly elderly. Women of reproductive age, aware that in practising contraception they are considered to be living in sin and unfit to receive the blessed sacrament, are staying away from mass. Their children will stay away, too. </p> <p>According to the papal thinktank, the false prophets of feminism have had a tendency \"to emphasise strongly conditions of subordination in order to give rise to antagonism\". The subordination, it would appear, is real, but feminists who refer to it will be accused of having no higher aim than to \"give rise to antagonism\". Such contempt for the motives of others explains how Wojtyla supported Solidarity, the Polish workers' movement, when he was archbishop of Krakow, but as Pope refused to support the worker priests led by Archbishop Helder Camara, the only articulate people fighting the cause of the dispossessed peasants in Brazil, the largest Catholic nation on earth. The priests were already vulnerable to the Brazilian authorities because of their involvement in organising mass protests. Wojtyla's intervention reassured the posseiros and their allies that the church's resources would no longer be used in the struggle against them. </p> <p>The long-term result has been a waning of faith even among the suggestible poor in Brazil, who were drawn off into evangelical sects. Now only 13% of Brazilians ever go to mass. Brazil, which was 99% Catholic 50 years ago, is still three-quarters Catholic, but its Catholicism is now less than lukewarm. The phenomenon is repeated all over Latin America; the people still call themselves Catholic but their participation in the life of the church is notional rather than actual. Globally, Catholics use as much contraception, have as many abortions, and divorce as often as non-Catholics; the difference is that they must accept that they have sinned, and endure guilt and punishment, hence the ban on condom use for Catholics, even if they have full-blown Aids. </p> <p>Wojtyla's refusal to support liberationists in Brazil was in no way motivated by reluctance to involve the church in politics. Neither Wojtyla nor Ratzinger would hesitate to intervene in any political situation that threatened religious orthodoxy. In June this year, Ratzinger issued \"Worthiness to Receive Holy Communion. General Principles\", arguing that support for abortion rights and euthanasia would render a Catholic unworthy of receiving the sacrament. The purpose of this paper, which was originally written in English, was to pressure American bishops into refusing to allow John Kerry to receive communion, thus effectively excommunicating him, and frightening Catholics away from voting for him. Kerry's persecution is the more remarkable because nothing of the kind had ever been attempted in Italy, where a succession of Catholic politicians have made no secret of their liberal principles. The attempted interference in US politics is likely to prove another own goal, as non-Catholics are reassured about Catholic Kerry's liberal credentials. To their credit, the American bishops resisted the call to direct action, taking refuge in a verbal fudge that Ratzinger had not had the foresight to pre-empt. </p> <p>Those people who see in the encyclical a rapprochement between feminism and the papacy have got to be more concerned for their faith than for their sanity. Although Catholics will argue passionately that no human being should be brought into existence for the benefit of another, and Ratzinger, the hammer of heresy, would lead them in their rejection of human cloning, they are happy to accept the biblical account that says that Eve was cloned from Adam's rib because it was not good for him to be alone. Though Ratzinger believes that man and woman are made in God's image (which would seem to mean that God is hermaphroditic rather than sexless), he is a confirmed heterosexualist. For him there can be no blurring of the essential contrast, man = hammer, woman = anvil. Woman can only exist within a male context, carrying out male-defined functions, for which she should be praised and rewarded. </p> <p>Catholic feminists who snatch at the straw of the Pope's statement that housework should be paid for should remember that Wojtyla cannot imagine a world in which housework is done by anyone but women. His Holiness's lavatory is cleaned by nuns. </p> <p><b>Catholic women respond ... </b></p> <p><b>Frances Kissling, president of US-based Catholics for a Free Choice</b> </p> <p>It's funny that some women have to find some good in this document when it's not there. Maybe it speaks to the Vatican view that women are basically nicer. The points that have been welcomed are not new. Moreover, the reason put forward for wanting women in the workplace is that they have some kind of 'feminine' civilising influence. This seems to me offensive, to men and to women. And where are the men in this document? Apart from Adam, they don't get a mention. What about men's values? The Vatican has this notion of the hedonistic northern woman and the pure southern woman, who doesn't want freedom or equality - but women in Latin America and Africa want just as much in terms of rights and freedoms, if not more. </p> <p><b>Esther Chavez, women's rights activist, Mexico</b> </p> <p>This letter presents women as people with limited consciousness, who do not know the difference between right and wrong, and it ignores those who are abused and have no access to justice. What about those women whose fathers or husbands take away their pay packet? It's a big disappointment. </p> <p><b>Dr Mary Condren, lecturer in gender and women's studies, Trinity College, Dublin</b> </p> <p>Presented by a first-year undergraduate, this essay would barely merit a pass. So why bother to respond? The continued assault on lesbian and homosexual relationships fuels homophobia. Faulty logic, backed by the veto power of the Vatican and aligned with rightwing fundamentalisms will, at forthcoming UN meetings, have serious consequences for non-western women struggling for self-determination. If Jesus were here today he would be crying out, \"Not in my name.\" </p> <p><b>Alessandra Mussolini, rightwing MEP, Italy</b> </p> <p>The Pope says women are important - but we should stay at home and be important there. He is telling women to stop fighting when there's more fighting to do. But this isn't a fight against men; it's a fight for our rights. Why can't women say mass, I wonder? What I'd like to see is the Pope with a beautiful female cardinal at his side. </p> <p><b>Maria Jose Rosado Nunes, lecturer at the Catholic University of Sao Paulo, Brazil</b> </p> <p>These men have no right to speak for us. The document equates women with maternity, and gives them no intrinsic value: they are for others, for men, for their children, for the church. </p> <p><b>Matilda Musumba, anthropologist and NGO worker, Nairobi, Kenya</b> </p> <p>This speaks to my mother's and grandmother's generations. When I came to the section on work I thought, 'Great,' but then it seems we cannot forget the kids or the house either.

  "The latest round of terrorist arrests in Pakistan has sparked a security alert in New York and Washington, rumours of a Heathrow bomb plot in London, and claims of victory in the war on terror in Islamabad. They have also made observers wonder about the trigger for the arrests, and the extent to which the Pakistani security services are producing terrorists out of a hat at politically expedient moments rather than cracking down on extremism. <p>Officials in Pakistan have rounded up 20 terrorists in the last month, including Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani, a Tanzanian indicted for his role in the 1998 bombings of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. He was arrested along with 13 others on July 25, and at least six other people have been held since then. </p> <p>Those arrests followed the capture of computer expert Muhammed Naeem Noor Khan, whose computer allegedly held details of a planned attack on Heathrow and five financial institutions in New York, Washington, DC and New Jersey. In addition, the Pakistani interior minister, Faisal Saleh Hayyat, said his country was holding two senior al-Qaida fugitives of African origin, one of whom had a multi-million dollar bounty on his head. He has refused to name them, say where they were from, or reveal when they had been arrested. </p> <p>The Pakistani security services made their most high profile catch to date in March 2003 when they seized Sheikh Khalid Mohammad, allegedly the mastermind of the September 11 2001 attacks on the World Trade Centre and Pentagon. He has been extradited to the US.</p> <p>Pakistan's president, Pervez Musharraf, told English language newspaper Dawn that the latest arrests proved his government had the courage to confront Islamist terrorists and was meeting with significant success.</p> <p>\"Nobody was touching religious organisations, now we are touching them,\" he told the paper. \"Therefore, they will set off bomb blasts, they will create problems for you. Because we are arresting them, and ... we are eliminating masterminds.\"</p> <p>In the past, however, roundups of terrorists have often coincided with politically convenient moments for Pakistan. The latest arrests come after Mr Musharraf pardoned the father of Pakistan's nuclear programme, Abdul Qadeer Khan, after the US accused him of selling nuclear expertise and equipment to Libya, Iran and North Korea. </p> <p>Such blatant promotion of nuclear proliferation would normally earn a country the status of rogue state, and the sanctions that come with it. But the US held off, some believe because the US president, George Bush, wanted Pakistan to come up with some senior al-Qaida figures before the US election in November. </p> <p>But Gareth Price, senior research fellow at the Royal Institute of International Affairs, said the shift in Mr Musharraf's motivation could be traced to an assassination attempt in December, and the fact that he and his government are the most obvious targets for extremists within Pakistan. </p> <p>\"Musharraf is not hedging his bets anymore. It is not clear how much the ISI [Pakistani security services] act autonomously, but they clearly are finding people, arresting them, and handing them over the US.</p> <p>\"Pakistan does tick most of the boxes of a rogue state, so it has to demonstrate that it is not,\" Dr Price said.</p> <p>Muhammad Ali Siddiqi, the assistant editor of Dawn, said the reason for the success of the anti-terror strategy was simply one of resources. With a peace process underway along the line of control in Kashmir, Mr Musharraf had been able to move troops to the tribal areas where many of the terrorists have sought refuge.</p> <p>\"By a rough estimate, Pakistan has deployed 70,000 troops in the Wana area in South Waziristan. This could not have been possible earlier,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Siddiqi also felt that no deal between the US and Pakistan was necessary to convince Mr Musharraf to crack down on terrorists, as the country itself had been the victim of devastating attacks. Last week nine people died in an unsuccessful assassination attempt on Pakistan's prime minister-designate, Shaukat Aziz. </p> <p>\"I do not think there is a bargain of that sort. Trial or no trial [of Dr Khan], the US would expect Pakistan to continue the war on terror. At Camp David last year, the US pledged a $3bn (\u00a31.64bn) economic and military package spread over five years. Each year Congress will approve $600m only when it is satisfied that Pakistan is behaving,\" he said. </p> <p>In the long term, Dr Price said, the combination of US aid money and an internal crackdown on terrorists could result in a different kind of Pakistan. With money for education, he said, \"people won't feel so radicalised and they won't be educated only in madrasahs [schools for Islamic religious instruction].\"</p> <p>Change on that scale takes a long time, he added, and there was reason to fear that Mr Musharraf may not live to see it.</p>",
  "<p>Senator John Kerry, the Democratic presidential candidate, has offered his most detailed plans yet to halve the US budget deficit while increasing spending on healthcare and education.</p> <p>Healthcare is a major ingredient of Mr Kerry's programme. He wants to extend health coverage to tens of millions of uninsured Americans while reducing premiums for the insured - a proposal that will cost $650bn (\u00a3357bn) over 10 years. He also wants to spend more than $200bn on education.</p> <p>To pay for that spending, Mr Kerry plans to claw back the recent tax cuts for the roughly 3% of the US population with incomes above $200,000, although he will make tax cuts for the middle class permanent. </p> <p>So, for a start, his tax plans are fairer. According to a non-partisan thinktank, the Tax Policy Centre, the largest tax cuts would go middle and upper middle income households, while those earning more than $1m would face a substantial tax increase, at an average of more than $93,503 more in tax in 2005. The Democratic candidate's tax plans would also cost less. The Tax Policy Centre calculates that his plan would cut tax revenues by around $602bn over 10 years, including $361bn to make the middle class tax cuts permanent. </p> <p>That compares with Mr Bush's budget plans, which would slash revenues by $1240bn, of which around $990bn can be attributed to making most of the 2001 and 20003 tax cuts permanent.</p> <p>In pushing his plan, Mr Kerry has harked back to the Clinton years, saying he would bring back the kinds of policies that brought about sustained economic growth and a balanced federal budget. </p> <p>His economic advisers certainly include many Clinton alumni, including Robert Rubin, the urbane former Treasury Secretary, and the former national economic adviser Laura Tyson. </p> <p>Moreover, Mr Kerry yesterday issued a list of some 200 business figures who are backing him, including the former Hollywood mogul Barry Diller and Peter Chernin, the chief operating officer of News Corporation, to boost his business-friendly image.</p> <p>As Mr Kerry points out, the US enjoyed a big budget surplus when Mr Clinton was in the White House. </p> <p>Now, however, the nation has a big budget deficit. The White House last week said it expected this year's budget gap to reach $445bn - less than it had previously estimated, but still a record in dollar terms. </p> <p>But Mr Kerry should not too be too quick to claim that he will restore fiscal responsibility to the White House. While the fact that his tax proposals put the onus on richer Americans, making them fairer, his spending plans - especially on health insurance coverage - will put pressure on government coffers.</p> <p>\"On balance, these elements of the two plans would add roughly the same amount to the federal debt over the decade,\" says the Tax Policy Centre.</p> <p>True, Mr Kerry has pledged to raise money from eliminating \"corporate welfare\" and closing tax loopholes that he says will lead to $500bn in savings over 10 years. But if the Republicans retain control of the House and the Senate, he will have a tough time achieving the changes he wants. </p> <p>The Kerry-Edwards team has also ruled out spending cuts from swathes of the budget, limiting their freedom of manoeuvre. They say they are committed to ensuring domestic discretionary spending does not grow faster than inflation. </p> <p>In the next breath, however, they say that defence, homeland security, health, education, medicare (health care for the elderly), social security (state pensions) and other mandatory programmes are off limits for cuts. Talk about tying one hand behind your back.</p> <p>Total discretionary spending for this year under the Bush budget will come to $875bn. Of that, education, homeland security, health and defence come to $605bn. </p> <p>Making defence safe from spending cuts seems odd, unless it is designed to reinforce the point that Mr Kerry would make a tough commander-in-chief. That is a shame, because he would save a quick $10bn if he axed the national missile defence programme - known as son of Star Wars - which has \"white elephant\" written all over it.</p> <p>In the end, the figures that his team is bandying about will probably be soon forgotten, even if he gets to the White House. </p> <p>Economic growth is the key to whether the budget deficits come down or not. If the economy grows at around 4% annually, the pool of red ink will dry up. </p> <p>Whoever is installed in the White House after November will probably have less influence in that respect than Alan Greenspan, the man at the Federal Reserve, and whoever succeeds him.</p> <p>What really worries analysts is whether the Fed has allowed inflationary pressures to build up too fast. If this proves to be the case, it will have to drop its \"measured approach\" and raise interest rates more aggressively. That would inevitably put the brakes on the economy, and would really blow a hole in the deficit.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Mark Tran is the business editor of Guardian Unlimited</p>",

  "\"I think they intend to go to Chicago or some place and fly into a building - Don't worry, Dad - If it happens, it'll be very fast - My God, my God.\" Peter Hanson, a passenger on United Airlines Flight 175, is talking to his father, Lee Hanson, at 9am on Tuesday September 11 2001. He thinks that he's about to die. A son's instinctive compassion leads him to look beyond the grave and help a father's grieving: \"Don't worry, Dad - If it happens, it'll be very fast.\" Three minutes later, his plane strikes the World Trade Centre in New York and Peter Hanson is dead. <p>This phone transcript from the recently published 9/11 commission report reminds us why the United States is a country that still considers itself to be at war. As I write, Washington has just joined New York on the second highest level of alert against terrorist attack. President Bush has announced the creation of a new national intelligence director and counterterrorism centre, swiftly implementing key recommendations of the bipartisan 9/11 commission. According to a recent poll, the military is by far the most trusted institution in the United States. Four out of five Americans say they have confidence in the military, compared to just one in five who trust Congress. In the presidential election, warlike images prevail. It's as if Bush and Kerry are standing mainly for the office of commander in chief. </p> <p>John Kerry started his acceptance speech at last week's Democratic convention by giving a military salute and saying, \"I'm John Kerry, and I'm reporting for duty.\" He was introduced, very movingly, by a veteran who lost both legs and one arm fighting in Vietnam. On stage were other Vietnam veterans who served with Kerry on one of the so-called swift boats going up the Mekong river. That swift boat provided the metaphor for Kerry's whole speech. Evoking \"our band of brothers\" he said: \"We may be a little older, we may be a little greyer, but we still know how to fight for our country.\" Pointing to a giant stars and stripes flag, he recalled how \"Old Glory\" used to fly \"from the gun turret right behind my head and it was shot through and through and tattered, but it never ceased to wave in the wind.\" And he came back to the gunboat at the end, claiming that the men who served on it cared nothing for their differences of race and background. \"That is the kind of America that I will lead as president: an America where we are all in the same boat.\"</p> <p>This unabashed, emotional, militant patriotism is something unimaginable in contemporary Europe. Watching many hours of it, glued to the television screen here in California, I felt conflicting emotions: some envy of a nation that still has the confidence and optimism to evoke those simple, primary colours, \"freedom and faith and family\" as Bill Clinton put it, in a brilliant speech; some alarm at the way in which my own emotions could be manipulated, for this Democratic convention was directed like a Hollywood movie. (Steven Spielberg helped with the documentary film introducing Kerry.) Then a fit of old European irony at the patriotic kitsch. John Kerry served bravely in Vietnam, but only for four and a half months. We shall be hearing about his service for a lot longer. </p> <p>I was reminded of an old Czech joke about the much mythologised Slovak national rising against the Nazis: \"Which lasted longer, the Slovak rising or the film about the Slovak rising?\" And yet, through it all, I had an overwhelming sense that here, amid these enthusiastic men and women of every colour and background, was the other, better America, which has got lost from European view amid the Cheneys, Rumsfelds and Bushes. </p> <p>Of course we all understand what is behind this war show. Here are the Democrats defiantly occupying the high ground of patriotism and national security on which the Bush White House has chosen to fight this election. Swing voters should trust the seasoned Vietnam veteran Kerry to win the war on terrorism rather than the Vietnam draft-avoider Bush. Kerry's critique of the way the Iraq war has been prosecuted, alienating America's friends around the world and without any proper plan for winning the peace, is compelling. In fact, almost every point that critical Europeans have made against the Bush administration was made by Democrats at the convention. They spoke passionately about the environment. They pilloried America's dependence on \"foreign oil\". They talked again and again about how America cannot win this war on its own. </p> <p>Will this campaign strategy work? Although people say Kerry is a strong finisher, I have a nagging feeling that he may still prove too remote and wooden for the undecided swing voters, when contrasted with the folksy Bush. (A reporter who has followed Kerry as a senator in Boston pays him a deadly compliment. John Kerry, he says, is perfectly qualified to be the president - of France.) So much will depend on what happens in the last weeks of the campaign; in America, and in Iraq. If it were possible for this to happen without more American soldiers coming home in bodybags, and tens of ordinary Iraqis dying for every one American, I would express the Machiavellian hope that things should get visibly worse in Iraq until election day, then dramatically better from November 3 on. </p> <p>If Kerry does scrape home, Europe will find a president who leads a more congenial America in almost every respect. But we won't be back to business as usual before September 11 2001. The key difference is now clear. All American leaders think we are at war; most European leaders think we are still at peace. </p> <p>The Bush administration started out believing that the United States could, if need be, win this war on its own. A Kerry administration would start from the position that this war can only be won by working with America's friends and allies around the world. It will therefore ask us to step straight up to the plate. Kerry's carefully unspecific recipe for the future of Iraq is that bringing more allies on board should help to reduce the American troop presence there. </p> <p>If Europe has any wisdom at all, we should start thinking now about how we answer this Democratic challenge. Our answer should be, \"Yes, so long as _ \" Yes, so long as you rededicate yourself to a peace process between Israel and Palestine. So long as you recognise that Iraq has to be embedded into a much larger project of reform and development in the broader Middle East, which America and Europe can only achieve together. So long as you deliver on your promises to develop alternative energy technologies, address your own excessive carbon dioxide emissions, come back to the international treaties and institutions that the Bush administration abrogated and scorned. </p> <p>We're all in the same boat, too, and we want to be. However, before skipper Kerry pulls the throttle, we have to agree not just the rules of engagement but who exactly the enemy is and what creek we're up. </p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>Timothy Garton Ash's new book, Free World: Why a Crisis of the West Reveals the Opportunity of Our Time, was recently published by Penguin </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.freeworldweb.net\">www.freeworldweb.net</a></p>",
  "<b>Filthy lucre</b> <br> <p><b>Oil, oil - everywhere!</b><br> </p> <p>Oil prices are soaring, stock markets are falling, the end of the world is nigh. Purnomo Yusgiantoro, the Indonesian president of Opec, has warned that the cartel will not be able to increase production to bring down prices, the rise in which has been fuelled by uncertainty over the future of Russian oil giant Yukos and attacks on pipelines in Iraq. Better fill up now before we hit $50 a barrel. </p> <p>The 11 members of Opec - Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela - supply more than 40% of the world's oil and have more than 75% of all proven reserves. They have us over a ... well, they've certainly got us where they want us. Yusgiantoro's statement may even be a bargaining ploy. So the answer, surely, is to start looking beyond Opec. </p> <p>Hampshire may be a good place to start. Last summer, Northern Petroleum struck oil near Winchester, between the A31 and A272, and it thinks the field could be good for 100m barrels. The company is also exploring widely in West Sussex and on the Isle of Wight. That's the spirit. The Campaign to Protect Rural England is objecting to drilling, but let's hope Northern's valiant efforts are not blocked by such stockbroker-belt nimbyism. </p> <p>And what about Rajasthan? Shell had more or less abandoned prospecting there, but oil minnow Cairn Energy made several major finds this year and reckons Rajasthan could be the new Texas; it has already found fields with an estimated 360m barrels of recoverable oil and is now planning exploration in Nepal. Cairn is run by former Scottish rugby international Bill Gammell; playing rugby for Scotland is the perfect pursuit for unquenchable optimists. Cairn invested $7.2m in the search for oil in Rajasthan; the find could be worth $500m. Gammell was recently named Scottish entrepreneur of the year. </p> <p>BP's latest Statistical Review of World Energy pinpoints reserves in improbable places: Denmark has 1.3bn barrels, Peru 1bn, Papua New Guinea 400m. Greece looks promising; Kazakhstan has huge potential (though there are fears that drilling could trigger earthquakes); the North Sea is by no means exhausted, with major new finds still being made; there are hopes that substantial reserves will be found in the Falklands; and \u00a335m is being spent on offshore exploration in North Wales. Today Colwyn Bay, tomorrow the world. We should stop panicking and start drilling.<br> <b>Stephen Moss</b> </p> <p><b>Secret history</b><br> </p> <p><b>Getting the measure of a president</b><br> </p> <p>Forty years ago this month, President Lyndon Johnson used an apparent North Vietnamese attack on US boats to demand that Congress give him powers to wage war. But he also had more mundane concerns. This is an excerpt from a taped phone conversation on August 9 1964. </p> <p><b>Operator:</b> Go ahead, sir. <br> <b>LBJ:</b> Mr Haggar? <br> <b>JH:</b> Yes, this is Joe Haggar. <br> <b>LBJ:</b> Joe, is your father the one that makes clothes? <br> <b>JH:</b> Yes sir - we're all together. <br> <b>LBJ:</b> Uh huh. You all made me some real lightweight slacks, uh, that he just made up on his own and sent to me three or four months ago. There's a light brown and a light green, a rather soft green, a soft brown. <br> <b>JH:</b> Yes, sir. <br> <b>LBJ:</b> And they're real lightweight now and I need about six pairs for summerwear.<br> <b>JH:</b> Yes, sir. <br> <b>LBJ:</b> I want a couple, maybe three of the light brown kind of a almost powder colour like a powder on a lady's face. <br> [. . .] <b>JH:</b> Yes, sir. <br> <b>LBJ:</b> I need ... they're about a half a inch too tight in the waist. <br> <b>JH:</b> Do you recall, sir, the exact size? I just want to make sure we get them right for you. <br> <b>LBJ:</b> No, I don't know - you all just guessed at 'em, I think, some - wouldn't you have the measurement there? <br> <b>JH:</b> We can find it for you. <br> <b>LBJ:</b> Well, I can send you a pair. I want them half a inch larger in the waist than they were before, except I want two or three inches of stuff left back in there so I can take them up. I vary ten or 15 pounds a month. <br> <b>JH:</b> All right, sir. <br> [. . .] <b>LBJ:</b> Now the pockets, when you sit down, everything falls out, your money, your knife, everything, so I need at least another inch in the pockets. And another thing - the crotch, down where your nuts hang - is a little too tight, so when you make them up, give me an inch that I can let out there, uh, because they cut me, it's just like riding a wire fence. These are almost, these are the best I've had anywhere in the United States. <br> <b>JH:</b> Fine. <br> <b>LBJ:</b> But, uh, when I gain a little weight, they cut me under there. So, leave me ... you never have much of a margin there. See, if you can't leave me an inch from where the zipper (burps) ends, round, under my back to my bunghole, so I can let it out there if I need to. <br> <b>JH:</b> Right. <br> <b>LBJ:</b> Now, be sure you have the best zippers in them. These are good that I have. If you get those to me, I would sure be grateful. <br> <b>JH:</b> Fine. Now where would you like them sent, please? <br> <b>LBJ:</b> White House. <br></p> <p><b>Childish things</b><br> </p> <p><b>Don't play with me, dad</b><br> </p> <p>So children up to the age of 12 would rather play with their mothers, siblings, friends, grandparents, lumps of wood - anything other than their fathers, according to a poll commissioned by the Children's Play Council and the Children's Society. Apparently fathers lack imagination, are often at a loss as to how to play games - or are simply too competitive. \"Children will get fed up if they lose all the time,\" said Tim Gill, CPC's director. \"It's frankly demoralising and not much fun.\" </p> <p>Leaving aside questions of what the Children's Play Council is or does, and what Gill's office looks like (I imagine him wading to his desk through a sea of brightly coloured plastic balls), what we seem to have here is yet another pronouncement from the Department of the Bleeding Obvious. Of course fathers are rubbish at playing with their children. Children have suspect bowling actions, are easily fooled at most card games, and the rules of What's the Time, Mr Wolf? are, famously, of Byzantine complexity. </p> <p>The big issue is letting them win. The Competitive Dads who refuse to lower their game to the child's level are, basically, jerks. Those who always let little Timmy win lest his self-esteem takes a knock are, on the other hand, creeps. </p> <p>Personally, I steer a middle course by being genuinely atrocious at almost all sports, and playing left-handed at any for which I possess a shred of talent. The simplest technique involves avoiding playtime altogether, but this can be hard in the summer holidays and lead to rebuke. </p> <p>The trick is to find a game that you both like, and that it is important for youngsters to learn. Snooker is one. You can get a small table from Argos for a song. Pinball is another. Not all households can run to a pinball machine, but mine can, so nyaah. </p> <p>If all else fails, remember the way fathers are traditionally supposed to interact with their offspring. Your job is to puff on your pipe, look absent-minded for a minute or so, and then say: \"Ask your mother.\" Regardless of the question. <br> <b>Nicholas Lezard </b><br></p> <p><b>Foreign affairs</b><br> </p> <p><b>Arnie: the second act</b><br> </p> <p>It isn't easy to separate the businesses of being Arnold Schwarzenegger, governor of California and famous Austrian, and Arnold Schwarzenegger, action movie star, and former Mr Universe. Earlier this week, the governor settled a legal action against an Ohio firm for selling a bobble-headed likeness of him holding a gun. It was not the bobble-headed likeness that he objected to - the Bosley Bobbing Head Doll Co makes big-headed puppets of all sorts of people, including Bush and Hillary Clinton - rather, it was the machine gun that spooked Schwarzenegger's lawyers into action. Guns, it seems, are no longer part of the Terminator's arsenal. </p> <p>It will be interesting to see how the governor will react to Color Me Arnold: The Unofficial Arnold Schwarzenegger Coloring and Activity Book, to be published by Manic D Press, a San Francisco publisher, next month. Activities inside include connecting the dots to find Arnold groping a woman, colouring in the governor as Conan the Barbarian, and driving a Hummer from Hollywood to Sacramento. </p> <p>Co-author Lawrence Gipe says the book was inspired by the governor's own words and actions. \"It recontextualises the silliest of our governor's quotes - 'I think that gay marriage should be between a man and a woman' - into the juvenile setting they deserve,\" he says. </p> <p>And yet, while Schwarzenegger's prop, in a costly new ad campaign, is a sober state flag (along with the caption \"Arnold says California Wants Your Business\"); while the Austrian post office has just announced that it will produce 600,000 stamps bearing his face (prominently labelled Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger); and while his official website celebrates the passage of California's balanced budget, it also promotes the release of his Predator movies on DVD: extras include an If It Bleeds, We Can Kill It: The Making of Predator documentary. </p> <p>It doesn't seem to hurt: his political coffers are filling up faster than those of any California governor before him, and he has raised $2m a month since January - more than enough to repay the debts incurred during last year's recall vote and to begin salting some away for his 2006 re-election campaign. And in fact, he still sees himself as the Terminator, as he admitted to an interviewer on Monday - \"because I'm relentless, and will not stop until something gets done\". <br> <b>Edward Helmore </b></p>",
  "America's religious right claimed a victory yesterday in the campaign to cast November's elections as a struggle over public morality after a battleground state voted for a constitutional ban on gay marriage. <p>Some 71% of voters in Missouri supported amending the state's constitution to ban same-sex unions. \"I'm very gratified ... that the people of this state understand our current policy is a wise public policy and they want to see it protected from a legal challenge,\" said Vicky Hartzler, from the Coalition to Protect Marriage in Missouri. </p> <p>Hours later, a county court judge in Washington state arrived at a different conclusion about the institution of marriage, ruling that it would be unconstitutional to deny gay couples the right to wed. However, the state will await the legal opinion of a higher court before it issues marriage licences to same-sex couples. </p> <p>The high-profile divisions on gay marriage all but guarantee the issue a place in the elections, especially in battleground states across the American midwest. </p> <p>Missouri was the first of as many as 12 states scheduled to vote on the constitutionality of same-sex marriages in the coming weeks. </p> <p>A number of those ballots are in fiercely contested states such as Ohio and Michigan, and gay activists said yesterday they feared the issue would be used to mobilise conservative voters. </p> <p>\"The vote indicates that we have some work to do in educating people on why these amendments are discriminatory, and why it is not good to use the constitution to decide these kinds of social issues,\" said Seth Kilbourn of the Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights organisation. </p> <p>Gay marriage became a touchstone of the conservative agenda last year after judges in Massachusetts legalised same-sex weddings. </p> <p>While conservative states moved to legislate against such unions, cities from San Francisco to Plattsburgh in New York state tried to push the boundaries of the law by officiating over same-sex weddings. </p> <p>On one level, bans such as Missouri's are symbolic. It, like about 37 other states, has statutes restricting marriage to heterosexuals. Opponents of gay marriage say they fear courts could force the recognition of unions conducted elsewhere. Others dismiss the bans as bigotry. </p> <p>But the importance of gay marriage in the elections is undeniable. </p> <p>In February George Bush said he supported changing the US constitution to ban gay marriage, although it is acknowledged he has no chance of marshalling the required votes. </p> <p>John Kerry, his Democratic challenger, opposes a constitutional ban but he does not support gay marriage either.</p>",
  "John Kerry, the Democratic nominee for president, published a list of about 200 entrepreneurs supporting his run for the White House, in an effort to reassure voters of his moderate credentials. <p>The list, not unexpectedly, included endorsements from players in the entertainment and fashion industries. </p> <p>Among the signatories were Miramax boss Harvey Weinstein; former Hollywood mogul Barry Diller; the chairman of Warner Music, Edgar Bronfman Jr; Dreamworks co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg; Peter Chernin, the chief operating officer of News Corporation and Jann Wenner, chairman of Rolling Stone magazine's publisher, Wenner Media. Designers on the list included Donna Karan, Vera Wang and Diane von Furstenberg. </p> <p>But there was backing from other industries. Mr Kerry has public support from Robert Fisher, chairman of The Gap, August Busch, president of Budweiser's brewer, Anheuser-Busch, Jim Clark, the founder of Netscape and Eric Schmidt, the chief executive of Google. He also lists a handful of senior Wall Street figures. </p> <p>Mr Kerry released the list on the campaign trail in Iowa, a key swing state in the midwest where he is currently neck and neck with George Bush in the polls. Bill Clinton employed a similar tactic in his successful run for the White House in 1992. Publication of the list hints at the erosion of a traditional Republican party base. </p> <p>Mr Kerry has already enlisted the respected investor Warren Buffett and Apple founder Steve Jobs to his team. But the Republicans have deeper support among the business community and Mr Bush has raised more than Mr Kerry from corporate donors. </p> <p>Owsley Brown II, chairman of Brown-Forman, the maker of Jack Daniel's, is a former Bush supporter now backing Mr Kerry. He told the Wall Street Journal: \"It's not something someone does lightly and certainly not for someone like me, a registered Republican all my life. But it seems pretty clear that our choice last time has not been such a good one for the United States.\" </p> <p>Former Chrysler chief, Lee Iacocca, campaigned for Mr Bush in 2000 but has switched to Mr Kerry. </p> <p>He said Mr Bush was taking the US \"in the wrong direction\". </p> <p>The list appeared to be aimed at calming the nerves of some voters concerned that some of Mr Kerry's campaign promises might herald a hostile environment for corporate America. </p> <p>He has promised tax breaks for companies which employ workers in the US to discourage outsourcing and to close tax loopholes for companies registering overseas. </p> <p>He has also promised to end the special interests which have infiltrated Washington, especially the influence of the oil and gas industries in shaping government energy policy. </p> <p>Mr Kerry has also said he would roll back some of the tax breaks for the rich, awarded by Mr Bush. </p> <p>Releasing the list, Mr Kerry said: \"George Bush has been bad for American business. His irresponsible mismanagement of the economy has led to record deficits, job loss and decreased confidence in the economy.\" </p> <p>The music industry is also backing Mr Kerry. More than 20 acts including Bruce Springsteen, REM, Pearl Jam and the Dixie Chicks are to perform fundraising concerts in an effort to unseat Mr Bush. Nine concerts are planned, all in swing states. </p> <p>\"We're trying to put forward a group of progressive ideals and change the administration in the White House,\" Springsteen told the Associated Press. \"That's the success of failure, very clear-cut and very simple\". </p> <p>Wall Street chiefs backing Mr Kerry include Robert Hormats, the vice chairman of Goldman Sachs, Thomas Lee, who runs the venture capital firm Thomas Lee Company, Arthur Levitt, the former chairman of the securities and exchange commission and the investment banker Bruce Wasserstein.</p>",
  "The fog of war has descended over the campaign. Within 72 hours of the end of the Democratic convention, the department of homeland security declared a new terror alert, and the colour-coded level was jacked up to orange, verging on red. The reason, the government reported, was that the computer of an al-Qaida operative captured in Pakistan contained precise information about threats to five financial institutions in New York and Washington. <p>Then additional information was released: the intelligence was mostly three years old, the al-Qaida surveillance of US buildings had been mostly conducted through the internet, the computer file had been opened again in January for uncertain reason and with no new surveillance data added to it, and Pakistani officials said that the captured material indicated no new al-Qaida planning. </p> <p>The effect of the alert has been to throw the campaign into turmoil and momentarily freeze it. John Kerry decided to accept the administration's explanations at face value. His critique of Bush's war on terrorism must be made with iron discipline, based on the facts, not suspicions. Yet other Democrats claimed the administration was using the situation for political advantage, putting additional pressure on Kerry, who has to hold fast. </p> <p>In part, the level of partisanship increased because of the clumsy performance of Tom Ridge, the secretary of homeland security, who turned the announcement into a political rally. \"We must understand that the kind of information available to us today is the result of the president's leadership in the war against terror,\" he said. Whether planned politically or not, the alert exposed that, for Bush, it is the irreducible basis of his campaign. And while it starkly elevated his profile as the \"war president\" again, it also revealed indirectly the vacuum of his second-term programme. His hard-right issues are insufficient for a national majority, he is weak on the realities of homeland security, and he is desperate to smudge the history of his inactions leading to 9/11 and his responsibility for the deterioration of the Iraqi situation. </p> <p>The widespread cynicism about the alerts, which may have no grounding, is a product of Bush's intense politicisation of national security and his record of misleading statements about almost every aspect of war. </p> <p>The 9/11 commission report is a devastating record of Bush's passivity on terrorism, beginning with his first act: the demotion of the counterterrorism chief, Richard Clarke. The report documents that the administration \"was not ready to confront Islamabad\" on its support for the Taliban or to \"engage actively against al-Qaida\" and that it \"did not develop new diplomatic initiatives on al-Qaida with the Saudi government\". Bush told the commission that the August 6 2001 presidential daily brief, \"Bin Laden Determined To Strike In US\" was \"historical in nature\", though it contained current information. The neoconservatives, such as deputy secretary of defence Paul Wolfowitz, are depicted as dismissive - Wolfowitz opposed retaliation for the al-Qaida attack on the USS Cole as \"stale\" -and obsessed with Iraq as the source of all terrorism. </p> <p>Bush's campaign must try to blur memory of his history. When Kerry seized upon the commission's recommendations, Bush reacted by endorsing a new national intelligence chief. But he would give this new post no control over budget, no White House office, no power over personnel, and no authority over intelligence operations. Once again, he appeared to be acting only on political motives. </p> <p>Various bills for homeland security languish before the Congress, as Bush neglects them. His paltry $46m proposal for port security is more than $1bn short of what the US Coast Guard says is required. On port security, 10 Democratic amendments have already been defeated while Bush has slept. He prefers the money to be appropriated for tax cuts for the upper bracket. </p> <p>Bush is haunted not only by the ghosts of his own past but the ghosts of other presidents past. While he attempts to redeem his father's political fall by avoiding his mistakes, his effort at reversal is creating a similar estrangement from the voters. Elder Bush won his war against Iraq and withdrew without toppling Saddam; his ratings were then at their peak. But his obliviousness to economic circumstances undermined the heroic image. Lyndon Johnson had an ambitious domestic agenda backed by a landslide mandate. But he squandered it in the Vietnam quagmire; his political credibility undermined his party's for a generation. Now, Bush's faltering credibility is tearing at trust in US national security. Perversely, his campaign must exploit the fears that his failures have helped engender. For him, this is not a war of choice, but necessity. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Sidney Blumenthal is former senior adviser to President Clinton and Washington bureau chief of <a href=\"http://www.salon.com\">salon.com</a> </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:sidney_blumenthal@yahoo.com\">sidney_blumenthal@yahoo.com</a></p>",
  "<b> Denver Post</b> <br> Editorial, August 4 <p>\"The country is already on edge over the possibility of election-year terrorist attacks, so it's jarring to see that the Bush administration is playing politics with post-September 11 intelligence. Yet again. That's the only way to look at ... the breathless 'new' al-Qaida warning issued over the weekend by the homeland security director, Tom Ridge ... Much of the information is actually three to four years old - yes, some of it predating September 11 2001 ... </p> <p>\"The alert was issued immediately after the Democratic National Convention, with White House advisers wanting to reclaim control of the national agenda. The nation is jittery as the third anniversary of September 11 looms large. Anti-American terrorists would love to disrupt the US election process. The Bush administration would do well not to overplay politics and underplay the nation's security needs.\" </p> <p><b> Patrick Sabatier</b><br> Lib\u00e9ration, France, August 4  </p> <p>\"By invoking a menace that is undeniable but invisible, imperceptible, and above all unforeseeable, the US president can present himself in front of American voters as the guarantor of their security ... </p> <p>\"As far as the fight against terrorism goes, it is no doubt better to be guilty of doing too much than not doing enough. But it is a measure of the prevailing crisis of confidence in George Bush that he can be suspected of playing the Osama card in the hope of saving his threatened presidency. His previous history invites such suspicion. He has demonstrated, in the run-up to the war in Iraq, that he won't hesitate to use partial information, sometimes dubious and always subject to interpretation, from his intelligence services in order to justify his political choices.\" </p> <p><b> USA Today </b><br> Editorial, August 4  </p> <p> \"It is the most serious of allegations - that the nation's leaders would selfishly manipulate the gravest threat we face. While no one should be naive enough to think that the White House - or John Kerry's campaign - doesn't discuss the politics of terrorism, any evidence of terror alerts called for political advantage is lacking ... </p> <p>\"Mr Bush said on Monday that the reasons for alerts should be 'as transparent as possible' - letting the public know what's going on. The administration missed that mark by not explaining the threat more clearly. If its actions raised suspicions of political motivation, it has itself to blame. Facts to support such suspicions, though, are mighty scarce.\" </p> <p><b>New York Post</b><br> Editorial, August 4 </p> <p> \"Imagine the outcry if an attack succeeded without the public having been warned. And weren't many of those who are criticising the administration for over-reacting now equally critical of alleged underreaction to vague warnings in the months before 9/11? </p> <p>\"The fact remains that the terrorists are planning something big, and Americans - New Yorkers, in particular - need to be cautious ... Besides, it's better to be proven wrong in sharing information about a possible attack - than to be proven wrong in predicting that no such event will occur.\" </p> <p><b> Kathleen Parker</b><br> Orlando Sentinel, August 4 </p> <p>\"Logic gets lost amid such cynicism and paranoia. Except in the twisted logic of the bitterly partisan, there is no reason for Mr Bush to fake terrorist threats, especially against financial institutions, when he needs economic growth and stability for re-election. No real-world benefit accrues to him from threats that could shake market confidence. </p> <p>\"What is nearly as frightening as terrorist chatter is the degree of cynicism that makes the war on terror political. As we count down the weeks to the November election, each political party attacking the other, the terrorist sets his clock by eternity, patiently biding time for his window, which some seem willing to leave open. In the arsenal of terror, surely the cheapest and most effective weapon is our own self-defeating cynicism.\"</p>",
  "In a move seen as marking the end of more than a decade of civil war between Islamists and the military in Algeria, the country's army chief, General Mohammed Lamari, has stood down. <p>He blamed ill health for retiring at the age of 65, but many see political reasons for the retreat of a leading member of the group of generals who hijacked power to prevent Islamists taking charge after election victories in the early 90s. </p> <p>A guerrilla war in which 120,000 people were killed followed, with the army accused of being involved in atrocities as it fought Islamists who, in turn, massacred civilians. </p> <p>The portly Gen Lamari, his eyes hidden by sunglasses, had for the past decade been the leading figure among the so-called pouvoir or decideurs, the men who ran the country and, in effect, appointed its presidents. </p> <p>But he surprised many by insisting the army stand back at the presidential elections in April, despite his differences with the man who was re-elected and who looks to have taken control, Abdelaziz Bouteflika. Gen Lamari disagreed with President Bouteflika's attempt to persuade Islamists to give up armed struggle in exchange for a place in politics. \"The time has come for the military to ... go back to barracks,\" El Watan newspaper said yesterday.</p>"
