  "I admit it, I live in a fantasy world of spin. <p>That's where John Kerry recently accused George W. Bush of living. But Kerry was talking about Iraq. My own fantasy world has more to do with the campaign I'm trying to cover: who's winning, who's losing, and when it's time to call a winner. This fantasy world moves with the growing, swirling camp around each candidate - reporters, political operatives, donors, and volunteers, who all talk to each other and only to each other - swinging from elation to despair, hard to justify and harder to resist.</p> <p>By last Monday, for example, three days before Kerry officially romped over the president in a Florida debate, the press had essentially called the race for Bush. </p> <p>Monday night, I was waiting for John Edwards to arrive at a $1,000 a head fundraiser in a ballroom at a midtown hotel, the reporters were loosely confined behind a velvet rope in back as the disappointing crowd, mainly beefy labour union types, ate miniature apple pies and drank cheap red wine. A veteran city reporter from a New York tabloid sauntered up.</p> <p>\"Who actually thinks Kerry's going to win this?\" he asked the group of ten or so journalists. \"Raise your hand.\"</p> <p>There were a few snickers. Nobody raised his hand. The race was all but over. And when the actress Glenn Close stepped on stage to introduce the vice presidential nominee, you could tell that the dour mood had gotten to her. At one point she warned that if this election goes the wrong way, \"Our country will be no more.\"</p> <p>Of course, this was the second time the press had called the race. In midsummer, it had become increasingly clear that the Democrat would win. The Democratic convention, in Boston, focused relentlessly on Kerry's war record, and it seemed to work. One warm night in Boston, I speculated to a friend at Harvard that the tide had already turned, that Bush would be swept aside, and that what had looked to that point like a close race would seem, in retrospect, a historically compelled return to normalcy.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Iraq got messier and the economy sputtered on. David Broder, the Washington Post columnist who stands at the heart of Establishment opinion laid it out for us.</p> <p>\"Bush's Two Albatrosses\" was the title of Broder's August 15 column. He made the utterly compelling argument that Bush made two big policy gambles: the tax cuts and the Iraq invasion. </p> <p>\"If Bush can win reelection despite the failure of his two most consequential - and truly radical - decisions, he will truly be a political miracle man. But as his own nominating convention approaches, the odds are against him,\" Broder wrote. Kerry's supporters, beginning with the bloggers, took Broder's words and others as confirmation of their own hopes; and soon we could all write about the high morale in the Kerry camp. </p> <p>Then the Republicans had their turn. In New York, they broke all the rules. Democrats had tiptoed around the mass murder of September 11, worried they would be punished for \"politicizing\" it. The Republican convention featured widows introducing former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who recounted thinking, on September 11, \"Thank God George Bush is our president.\"</p> <p>Beat that, Democrats.</p> <p>This was quite a show, we all knew, and some post-convention polls showed Bush with a strong lead. Soon, coverage of the Kerry campaign had turned to post-mortems. One of Kerry's closest advisers for much of the campaign, Bob Shrum, submitted to a detailed profile in the New Yorker that revealed the kind of internal splits that, if they even exist in the Bush campaign, aren't aired in the press. Last Sunday, September 26, the New York Times ran a page 1 examination of the Senator's \"deliberative\" style. Its \"downside,\" the Times wrote, \"is a campaign that has often moved slowly against a swift opponent, and a candidate who has struggled to synthesize the information he sweeps up into a clear, concise case.\"</p> <p>In New York, I talked to Democratic Party operatives and financiers and came away with a story titled \"Kerry's Backers A Little Panicky As Bush Surges,\" which was true. Chatting with the same Harvard friend with whom I'd speculated on Kerry's impending victory a month earlier, I wondered whether, for all the chatter about how this election was set to be a close one, perhaps the floodgates were open, and that Bush would win a sweeping mandate like the one Ronald Reagan took in 1984, when he won 49 states. He reminded me of my earlier opinions, and accused me of being \"procyclical.\" My mood, it seemed, was always exaggerating the trend.</p> <p>Things had gotten so bad that the public opinion polls - themselves notoriously fluid --seemed an anchor to reality. Another friend, a young Democratic political consultant, started emailing me daily poll results, which showed the race consistently close. \"There's a separate conversation\" going on among the decisive voters in places like Ohio, he told me, one that reporters in Washington and New York don't even know about.</p> <p>Then came the debate, where Kerry was sharp. Bush seemed at sea. These were, I like to think, my inchoate, unspun impressions immediately after the debate. But they firmed up fast. The Democrats had benefited from the same low expectations that once helped Bush. I watched it on television, which cut quickly across the street from the debate hall in Florida to \"Spin Room\" - that was an official label. Kerry's spinners had the Republicans on defense. The New Republic's Ryan Lizza noted a particularly telling exchange when Karl Rove, the president's top political adviser, emerged to speak to the press.</p> <p>\"It was one of the president's better debate performances and one of Kerry's worst,\" Rove said. A reporter from the pro-Bush New York Post met him with incredulity.</p> <p>\"Can you say that with a straight face?\" he asked.</p> <p>The Democrats dominated the spin. By Friday morning, Republican press releases merely argued that the debate had been a \"draw.\" And we in the press are just looking for an excuse to call the race, again, for Kerry. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Ben Smith writes for the New York Observer.

  "<b>The following correction was printed in the Observer's For the record column, Sunday October 10 2004</b> <br>  In the article below we stated that several large donors to George Bush's campaign had also given to Nader. We should clarify that the Center for Public Integrity reports that while the 51 donors have given $54,300 to Nader, they have given the Democrats $66,000 and the Republicans $415,000. Nader's total from donors who have also contributed to the Republicans represents about 4 per cent of the $1.5 million he has raised.      Ralph Nader surveyed a packed hall of Florida students who had come to hear about his third-party tilt for the presidency. 'I am not here to flatter you. I'm going to take you to task,' he warned in his opening sentence. <p>'I am looking at the future,' he said dismissively, glaring at the sea of, in his view, apathetic and politically unaware young faces. 'And the future looks much like the past.' </p> <p>Many politicians start campaign speeches with an attack on an opponent. Few start with an attack on their audience. Then again, Nader is no ordinary campaigner. Nor is it an ordinary campaign. </p> <p>No figure divides America as much as Nader, the long-time liberal consumer activist turned political revolutionary, who is standing this time as an independent. Democrats blame him for robbing Al Gore of vital votes that cost him the 2000 election. Republicans love him for the same reason. Now both think it might happen again. </p> <p>Democrats are right to be worried. Nader has defied the odds and is in the final stages of crafting a presidential challenge across most of America. He is on the ballot in 31 states and expects that number to end up as nearer 40. Many are battleground states. </p> <p>That prospect has Democrats terrified. Last week, several new opinion polls showed how crucial Nader could be. In New Jersey the independent has just 2 per cent support, but Bush and Kerry are tied at 48 per cent. </p> <p>In New Hampshire, Bush and Kerry are tied at 46 per cent, while Nader again has 2 per cent. In Colorado, the former consumer crusader has 3 per cent, leaving Bush with a one-point lead over Kerry. Without Nader, Kerry would probably be winning there. Some Democrats are starting to see the nightmare of 2000 all over again. </p> <p>Nader can still draw crowds, as he proved when he criss-crossed hurricane-torn Florida last week, touring the swing state that still haunts Democrats. In the steamy resort town of Sarasota more than 300 people packed a university hall, overflowing into the corridors outside. They clapped and cheered his speech. </p> <p>In Tampa a day later another 150 people came to a theatre to hear him. 'Not even the hurricanes can stop you coming,' Nader told them. </p> <p>Hurricanes may not have put people off Nader, but the Democrats have tried to: they have launched a huge legal effort in many states to keep Nader off the ballot. Nader activists have been harassed and the signatures of support that the campaign has collected have repeatedly been challenged in court. </p> <p>At some Nader meetings Democratic stooges have stood up to beg the audience to vote for Kerry to stop Bush. High-profile liberals, such as Michael Moore, publicly begged Nader not to run. Democrats refer to Nader as 'a spoiler' candidate who will let the Republicans win. </p> <p>The effort has backfired, however. Nader comes across as a very angry man, and much of that anger is directed at Democrats, not Bush. At press conferences and rallies the same message is pumped out again and again: the Democrats are the same as the Republicans. </p> <p>'They are gutless, clueless and spineless. The Democratic Party is a shell of its former self. The fact that they can't landslide Bush shows their decadence,' Nader says. </p> <p>He is also fired up by the Democratic lawsuits, which have cost many thousands of dollars to defend. 'They are going to pay a woeful price for this. People don't like bullies.' </p> <p>For Democrats, people like Adam Tebrougge, 42, a lawyer who has been active in the Sarasota Democratic Party but is now supporting Nader, are a deeply worrying sign that their plans to eliminate Nader have hurt only themselves. </p> <p>In Sarasota, Tebrougge listened as one Nader aide begged the crowd for a $500 donation. His hand shot up and a few minutes later he handed over his cheque. </p> <p>Tebrougge said: 'I was very affected by Kerry's attempts to get Nader off the ballot. That might even have made the difference with me.' </p> <p>Nader is clear what he thinks will happen in this election: Bush will win. He is clear too about who will be to blame. 'Kerry is taking away more votes from himself than I ever could,' Nader said. </p> <p>The truth is more complex, however. Behind Nader's campaign lies a complex web of Republican support - often unsolicited but usually welcome - that seems to play into the hands of the Bush White House. Many Republicans see Nader as another weapon with which to beat Kerry. </p> <p>Nader denies that it is a concerted Republican effort, but it seems widespread. Nader's legal fight to get on the ballot in Florida was crucially backed by Governor Jeb Bush, the President's brother. In other states it is Republican law firms that have successfully fought Democrat attempts to stop him standing. </p> <p>Some Republican groups have collected signatures to try to get him on the ballot. In Nevada, the man behind the effort was Steve Wark, a top Republican consultant. The Nader campaign has also used the Florida-based firm JSM, whose parent company previously helped the election campaigns of Ronald Reagan and the elder George Bush. JSM has been dogged by repeated allegations of collecting fraudulent Nader signatures, especially in the swing state of Ohio. </p> <p>Republicans have also played a role in financing Nader. Several large donors to Bush's war coffers have dug in their pockets for Nader. They include billionaire John Egan, one of the most prominent financial backers of Bush's political career, and Houston businessman Nijad Fares. One study showed that nearly one in 10 of those who gave Nader $1,000 or more also gave to the Republicans. </p> <p>As some Democrats complain about dirty tricks, however, Nader is striking a chord with others on the main issues. Unburdened by the prospect of success, he is free to make his unbridled opposition to the Iraq war a popular part of his platform. </p> <p>He is lobbying for a withdrawal of US forces in six months' time. Nader's biggest cheers always come with the mention of getting out of Iraq. He compares Iraq to Vietnam, warning darkly of a reinstatement of the draft. All this makes good ammunition for attacks but it is Kerry, not Bush, who is the target. </p> <p>'I have never seen a Democrat be so reluctant to have an exit strategy. He now says he wants out in four years. Well in four years it will be worse than Vietnam,' Nader said. His speeches are unlike those of the main candidates. They change with each venue, appear to be mainly ad-libbed and attack the system, especially big business, with ferocity. Nader poses as an outsider aiming to bring the house down. That is not hard to do when, as Kerry and Bush whizz around in hired jets, your air tickets are bought at a pensioner's discount price. </p> <p>The crowds Nader is attracting this time, however, are much smaller than those of four years ago. Some of his speeches can also veer into the bizarre. He can sound like an angry old grandad, lecturing troublesome children. 'What happened to playing kick the can in the backyard?' he cried at one meeting in Miami as he ranted against Nintendo. </p> <p>But the real problem for Nader is people such as Vanessa White. Clutching Nader's book after the Sarasota meeting, she was fired up by his speech. Yet her vote was going to Kerry: the overriding thing was to get rid of Bush. 'I just really don't like Bush,' White said. 'That's what matters this time.' Nader knows he cannot hope for victory, especially when both major parties have combined to deny him any hope of appearing in the two remaining presidential TV debates. Nader jokes he may gatecrash the final debate, planned for Arizona. </p> <p>'I am talking to Zorro about sneaking through the air conditioning system and landing on the stage,' he quipped. </p> <p>But for Democrats, Nader's jokes are not funny. Even when denied a place in the debates, his campaign is a thorn in the Democrat side in several swing states, and in an election that could be decided by a few closely fought contests, even a small thorn can be fatal.</p>",
  "Bruce Springsteen hunched over his guitar with furious intensity, the stage lights flashing around him. As he belted out America's national anthem the sell-out crowd, who had come to hear Springsteen kick off America's biggest political concert tour in a generation, began to sing along. <p>For a moment it was the 1960s again and Springsteen was Jimi Hendrix at Woodstock. He then moved straight into another song. It was his famous hit 'Born in the USA', a paean to the lost generation who fought in Vietnam. </p> <p>But the war that loomed large over the Philadelphia concert hall was Iraq. It has sparked an almost unprecedented politicisation of America's entertainment industry. From documentaries such as Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11 to plays like Tim Robbins's Embedded, the entertainment industry has taken sides. Now it is music's turn. </p> <p>Springsteen's show in Philadelphia on Friday night kicked off the Vote for Change concert tour that will see some of the biggest rock stars in the world touring America's swing states. Their message is simple and direct: vote for John Kerry. Kick out George W Bush. </p> <p>Springsteen, in his first ever direct foray into trying to influence an election, took the stage hot on the heels of REM. 'Did you hear the presidential debate last night?' Springsteen asked the audience. 'We are on a roll,' he said and then he began another number. </p> <p>At the same time as Springsteen and REM were playing in Philadelphia, country band the Dixie Chicks were on stage in Pittsburgh on the other side of the state. Meanwhile, the Dave Matthews Band, Bonnie Raitt, John Mellencamp, Pearl Jam and a host of others were playing elsewhere. All in all, six Pennsylvania cities were hit on the same night. </p> <p>After Pennsylvania, the Vote For Change tour will head for Ohio, Florida, Michigan, Iowa and Wisconsin in a 10-day blitz of 34 shows in 28 cities. It will end in a televised concert in Washington DC. Along the way it will raise millions of dollars for two organisations, MoveOn and America Coming Together, which are the Democrats' main weapons in the election, registering voters and campaigning on the ground. </p> <p>Organisers hope the concerts will energise Democrat supporters in the swing states, or even convert Republicans to Kerry's cause. Certainly much of the Philadelphia concert seemed more like a political rally than a normal music concert. Young volunteers worked the queues of fans, registering them to vote and signing them up for the campaign. The message was working on many fans, though often it was preaching to the converted. Brian Dworkin was wearing a t-shirt with a picture of a puzzled-looking Bush on the front and the slogan: 'A village in Texas is missing its idiot'. </p> <p>But not all of the crowd were what the tour's organisers were looking for. Overwhelmingly middle-aged, full of lifelong fans of Springsteen and REM, quite a few of them were Republicans with no intention of switching sides. The videoed speeches were largely ignored and a brave few even wore pro-Bush t-shirts. Lawyer Randy Maniloff said: 'This just looks like the usual Bruce crowd. I mean, I am here and I am voting for Bush.' </p> <p>He had no time for Kerry but also no regrets his $75 ticket would be going towards the anti Bush campaign. 'With luck they will be so inefficient that my $75 will end up more like two dollars and will only buy a Kerry bumper sticker,' he laughed.</p>",
