  "An informal poll of Guardian Unlimited users shows huge support for the Democratic presidential nominee, John Kerry, but considerable pessimism over his chances of entering the White House in November's election. <p>With George Bush riding high in the opinion polls after last week's Republican national convention in New York, a growing uncertainty over the Kerry campaign is reflected in our self-selecting internet survey, with nearly 40% of users conceding that Mr Bush's end-of-convention speech was likely to bring wavering voters out in support of the Republicans. </p> <p>While an overwhelming 78% of respondents would like to see Mr Kerry become America's 44th president, only 64% believe he actually will do so.</p> <p>The findings came after we asked Guardian Unlimited users around the world to participate in a \"world college\" to provide a snapshot of your views on the US elections. </p> <p>Only 6% of the 1,000 users who took part in our online survey admitted supporting, or having voted for, Mr Bush, while a sizeable 16% said their preferred candidate in the 2000 election was the independent Ralph Nader. </p> <p>Mr Nader, a radical leftwinger by US standards, was blamed by many for undermining Al Gore's presidential bid in 2000 by splitting the liberal vote. Fear of this happening again seems to have had an effect: fewer users say they would support Mr Nader this time round.</p> <p>A more detailed breakdown of the vote reveals some interesting trends among our users. Half of the respondents lived in the US, and showed themselves to be considerably more optimistic about Mr Kerry's chances than those from the rest of the world, with 71% of US users doubting the efficacy of Mr Bush's speech and the same number expressing a belief that Mr Kerry would make it to the White House. </p> <p>Non-US respondents were more circumspect, with only 54% believing that Mr Kerry would win the election, despite 75% wanting him to.</p> <p>In gender terms, both sexes were strongly supportive of the Democratic candidate. However, male respondents tended to be more pessimistic, with 75% of women anticipating a Kerry victory compared with 59% of men.</p> <p>Women were less likely to vote for other candidates, too, with Mr Nader more than twice as popular among men than women.</p> <p>The poll also dispels the myth of optimistic youth. Support for Mr Kerry was consistently high - more than 75% - across the ages, but whereas that support translated directly into electoral optimism among the older voters, the under-35s were almost evenly split on whether Mr Bush would be ousted from the White House.</p> <p>But while the younger respondents may not be hopeful of Mr Kerry beating Mr Bush, they are certainly more idealistic, with the highest percentage of Nader votes (20%) coming from the 18-24 age group.</p> <p>Of course, our poll is neither comprehensive nor statistically significant as it was compiled by canvassing the views of visitors to Guardian Unlimited who chose to answer the questions. However, the scepticism it indicates among Mr Kerry's supporters about his chances of success does mirror the findings of two recent polls carried out in the US. Surveys carried out for Time and Newsweek show the Democratic candidate trailing 11 points behind Mr Bush, the largest poll deficit yet in what has so far been a neck-and-neck race.</p> <p>Having established that there is a problem, the next question is what Mr Kerry should do to reinvigorate his campaign. And that's what we're asking you in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uselections2004/worldcollege/poll/0,15002,-137,00.html\">the next Guardian Unlimited world college poll</a>. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Click <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uselections2004/worldcollege/results/0,15003,1296810,00.html\">here</a> for the full results of the Guardian Unlimited world college poll.

  "The first of Mr Blair's monthly press conferences since the summer recess, and it seems the reshuffle, partly pre-empted by Andrew Smith's surprise resignation last night, will dominate. <p>Downing Street is apparently saying the rest of the reshuffle will not begin today, with speculation it will be carried out on Thursday. However, reporters will undoubtedly be intrigued by the apparent ruptures the departure of the work and pensions secretary, and the predicted return of Alan Milburn, have revealed between the prime minister and the chancellor.</p> <p>Of course, apart from all this there are also the forthcoming party conferences, the Queen's speech in November, and a byelection in Hartlepool to consider. Not to mention a likely general election next year. </p> <p><b>12.06pm</b><br> Mr Blair begins - with a few words about recent events in Beslan. \"We share Russia's grief in this dark hour,\" he says, adding that he has spoken with President Putin on the phone. \"We live in a world where this form of terrorism without limits, of appalling extremism, can occur anywhere in the world,\" he concludes.</p> <p>Before taking questions, he tackles two other topics - \"the best ever school results this country's achieved\" and the improved prospects of London winning the 2012 Olympics bid.</p> <p>He singles out Hackney and Hartlepool for credit in improved school results. </p> <p>On the Olympics, he says: \"It was a fantastic performance from Team GB in a Games which thrilled the country.\" London's bid is \"strong, and getting stronger\", with Wembley and the Dome both available as venues within the next few weeks and a Kings Cross-Hackney link up and running for 2012 if needs be.</p> <p>Oh - \"the reshuffle will not be today but it will be before the end of the week,\" he adds. </p> <p><b>12.15pm</b><br> As ever, Andrew Marr gets the first question. \"Do you look at candidates [for reshuffle] and ask 'are they one of mine?'\" asks the BBC man. </p> <p>Sky's Adam Boulton immediately comes in to ask about \"morale and the quality of your leadership\" considering the number of people who have left - citing Alan Milburn, Andrew Smith and Estelle Morris.</p> <p>\"You've done your statistics have you?\" asks Mr Blair testily, saying all prime ministers face ministers leaving after several years' work.</p> <p>\"You don't always take your decisions on the timetables other people assume,\" he concludes.</p> <p>Nick Robinson asks why Gordon Brown appears to have a \"veto\" over a cabinet reshuffle. He doesn't, and nor does anyone else, says Mr Blair.</p> <p>Andy Bell offers up a patsy question - forget the \"who's in, who's out\", he says. Give us a flavour of a third-term Labour government, he asks meekly. </p> <p>Mr Blair largely regurgitates his speech from last week spelling out the challenges facing Labour as it looks ahead to the next election.</p> <p>\"We are the most ideologically united government for a long time,\" he concludes.</p> <p><b>12.20pm</b><br> \"My personal position remains the same, but we will make an announcement to parliament first,\" he deadbats, when asked by Oonagh Blackman whether there will be ban on hunting before the next election.</p> <p>Onto Ulster, and Mr Blair says there is a chance of a deal at the Leeds Castle negotiations next week, but that \"all\" paramilitary activity must be forsaken, he insists - twice. \"They must stop it completely,\" he says, but refuses to be drawn into criticising the Rev Ian Paisley personally, despite the promptings of a journalist from Northern Ireland. </p> <p>The Daily Express, unsurprisingly, contrasts the treatment of \"radical clerics who preach hate\" with the \"delay\" at the Home Office over giving ex-Gurkha soldiers British citizenship.</p> <p>Mr Blair says he can understand people's concern, and an announcement on the Gurkhas is forthcoming. </p> <p>The Sun's Trevor Kavanagh tells Mr Blair that after seven years the government's pension is a \"complete failure\" - if you weren't going to sack Andrew Smith anyway, can you give us one good reason why not, he asks?</p> <p>The prime minister denies that Mr Smith was a \"failure\" and says every government in the world is grappling with the problems of pensions provision. </p> <p>The Daily Telegraph asks on the future of the 90 or so remaining hereditary peers if they frustrate the government over foxhunting, Lords reform or the children's or pensions bills.</p> <p>Mr Blair says his view hasn't changed on Lords reform and it is unrelated to specific bills.</p> <p>The prime minister is asked if he is ever going to get involved in campaigning for the north-east assembly, or just leave it to John Prescott. </p> <p>Mr Blair makes a vague assurance that he will be \"involved\", but says the final decision is for the people of the north-east.</p> <p>\"We have a very, very strong technical bid,\" the prime minister says of the Olympic bid, but denies the need for an \"Olympics minister\" saying he will be taking a very personal interest.</p> <p>Channel Four's Elinor Goodman gets no further in asking about Alan Milburn - \"why not wait for the reshuffle?\" he asks. </p> <p><b>12.30pm</b><br> \"That's a very good question,\" says Mr Blair of a demand as to whether the IRA is a threat to British security or if it's all over bar the symbolism.</p> <p>\"You can't have a peace settlement based on only 'a little bit' of violence,\" he finally answers, saying republicans have now realised that \"violence is a complete cul-de-sac.\".</p> <p>The Guardian's Michael White asks of the contrast between \"intolerance\" of hunting and a \"wildly permissive\" attitude to alcohol licensing and gambling. </p> <p>\"We are extending licensing hours - and why shouldn't we? All over Europe people drink without experiencing these kinds of problems.\"</p> <p>After two more interruptions, Mr Blair ignores Mr White. </p> <p>Mr Blair refuses to be drawn by the Independent on the comments by the Dutch prime minister over how Russia should now get involved in negotiations over Chechnya.</p> <p>\"Using children in this way has taken terrorism into a new, more depraved level,\" Mr Blair says.</p> <p>Back to Ulster, and Mr Blair says the negotiations cannot simply descend into a final press conference where everyone says \"we've had warm constructive talks\" again.</p> <p>CNN's Robin Oakley is back to Beslan, and whether Chechnya is part of the war on al-Qaida terrorism or a separate entity? </p> <p>\"There are legitimate issues, but today is a day of mourning for Russia and not the time to discuss them,\" says Mr Blair. \"It is terrorism without limits.\"</p> <p>\"We can win the war on terrorism, and ultimately we will win,\" responds Mr Blair when asked if he could define a \"victory\" in such a war. </p> <p><b>12.40</b><br> Mr Blair gets his best gag in so far. Asked if he still wants to be prime minister at the time of the 2012 Olympics, he pauses, then deadpans: \"Yes ... I also want to compete in them too!\"</p> <p>An LA Times reporter asks who Mr Blair will be backing in the US election. \"It's a matter for you and the American people,\" he stonewalls.</p> <p>\"Is \u00a3430m value for money?\" demands a Scottish reporter, speaking of the new Holyrood parliament building - that opened today. \"I refer you to Jack McConnell's answers earlier,\" says Mr Blair. </p> <p>\"Is there an exit strategy for Iraq?\" asks a Middle East journalist. \"Yes,\" says Mr Blair, pointing out the route of elections and the UN. \"We will achieve our objectives,\" he says, pointing to the 10 million people who have registered to vote in Afghanistan \"despite the threat of assassination\".</p> <p><b>12.45pm</b><br> How hard did you work to persuade Andrew Smith to say on, asks Central TV, cheekily. \"We've gone into all that,\" replies the prime minister testily. </p> <p>Mr Blair refuses to say more on hunting, beyond \"people forget that it's always been a free vote\" on the issue.</p> <p>\"I'll let you have that out with Dr Allawi,\" he says of an al-Jazeera reporter's complaint that the interim Iraqi government has closed down his media outfit. </p> <p>\"The loss of life in Iraq is terrible - but we're not causing the loss of life,\" says Mr Blair.</p> <p>Another reporter asks if the \"right message\" has been sent by the government, since only a \"junior minister\" (Bill Rammell) has been sent to North Korea.</p> <p>\"We're under no illusions about the regime in North Korea - you'll have to ask me whether it's been a success when he gets back.\"</p> <p>A Russian reporter asks point blank: \"What do you think about President Putin's policies in Chechnya?\"</p> <p>\"When Russia is in mourning we should concentrate our thoughts on the victims,\" says Mr Blair. </p> <p>The Press Association's Jon Smith questions the progress of investigations into British soldiers accused of brutality or criminality in Iraq. The attorney general will be reporting in due course, he is told, \"but the vast bulk are absolute heroes who do a fantastic job\".</p> <p>Three more questions, says Mr Blair. </p> <p>German TV asks what the exit plan from Iraq is - but Mr Blair has already answered that one - while a French reporter asks over the future of the two French hostages and whether this means France is not invulnerable to terrorism despite having been against the Iraq war. </p> <p>\"It's not helpful to rerun the issue of whether the Iraq war was right or wrong in that context,\" says Mr Blair. </p> <p><b>1pm</b><br> Finally: an Arab journalist complains that Mr Blair is using the word \"terrorism\" too freely. There is a distinction between the terrorists and state terrorists - especially the Israeli government's actions in the occupied territories.</p> <p>There's no equivalence between the actions of the Israeli government and the killing of as many innocent people as possible, says Mr Blair - although he has disagreed with some of Israel's actions.</p> <p>\"We've got to get back to the two-state solution which the majority of Israelis and Palestinians want to see,\" says the prime minister.</p> <p>After the election this has got to be a major priority for the international government.</p> <p>And that's it for September's press conference.</p>",
  "<b>Rachel Valladores, Democrats Abroad</b> <br> The campaign's not dead yet, folks. I know the media is going on and on in this campaign because of the polling right now which has Bush ahead by about 10 points. [But] we are not lying down and dying yet - far from it, actually. <p>I was on the BBC World Service this morning with John Zogby, who is one of the great American pollsters, and John's point of view on it is that this bounce is a temporary thing - this is the convention bounce, and there's still going to be one heck of a pitched battle. </p> <p>To me that was pretty obvious when I read in the Washington Post this morning that we had changed the entirety of the campaign staff around. Clinton decided to tell Kerry what to do about his staff, and ... they've moved John Sasso out of the Democratic National Committee and put him on the aeroplane, which means things are going to work very differently now. </p> <p>The mood of this campaign is really going to be markedly different. Reorganisation is a normal thing at this point in the campaign because we are changing phases, which means different stage management, different directions, and that's a good thing. It's going to be a meaner and leaner campaign. We have already seen that our hope is still the great message of this campaign - that was the message that came out of the convention. We spent a lot of time talking about hope being around the corner.</p> <p>Kerry is a strong finisher, so we are not giving up hope yet. To me it's really important to stress the fact that this is not an election that is going to be won or lost only on international issues. They are important - particularly Iraq and oil and the war on terror - but the truth of the matter is that the economy, which drives all those other things, is what is going to finally drive this. What's left right now is the swing voters, the voters who are going to worry about what's gonna happen to them; they don't really care what happens to other people.</p> <p><b>Clive Soley MP</b><br> There is an interest for us in what the US does, and that is for the US to be a team player, and that is what it is not likely to be under George Bush and the Republicans as they are at present. Let me say that since he first emerged on the scene, Kerry has struck me as being strong in personality and being strong in policies, so I have a positive approach to it. People ought to vote for him because he comes over as a good guy with also the right sort of policies and saying the right sort of things for today's world. It's a positive message. I don't think the Democrats could come up with someone better.</p> <p>His problem is partly about the economy. People tend to turn to rightwing parties when the economy gets a little bit rocky. Leftwing parties do best when things are getting better, which is why Kerry is having a bit of a problem with that issue. </p> <p>Kerry and the Democrats winning is very important to the rest of the world because the US, being the sole remaining superpower, does need to be on board on a lot of issues. The two most important challenges facing this planet in the 21st century are global warming and failing states. The two will dominate the politics, and economics, and social stability of this world I would say for the next hundred years, and we really have to work on that. We can only do that together. </p> <p>Europe and the US being close is very important, and that's important to Britain. Britain can have a unique bridging role between Europe and the US. There are problems in that relationship, big problems, but in a way we are better able to face that.</p> <p>The last point is that if there is a Kerry presidency, he has got take on board the Palestine-Israel issue. It is central and it is one that, although Bill Clinton did an awful lot on it, has not always been the strength of the Democratic party.</p> <p><b>David Aaronovitch, Guardian columnist</b><br> I think it is the right thing to support Kerry, but it won't make the slightest bit of a difference. First, there is absolutely nothing that we can do about this election. It is not up to British prime ministers to attempt to influence American presidential elections, for two reasons. First, it doesn't work. What do you do when you end up with the president you have campaigned so hard against? That's not how international politics work. Second, whatever the consequence, whatever the result is, we have somehow to manage it, we have to work with whatever it is, we have to think about how from that other position we try to get the things out of the situation that we decide we want. </p> <p>The third point is that it is the American presidential election, and consequently the result, is exceptionally important for us. I am going to add something which is very unpopular here. I think that the polls are probably the first major indication we have about how this election is going to go. We now know probably what are the issues that are going to define the results. The economic assault on George Bush has not yet, and probably will not, sufficiently convince a large number of people that they ought to drop a president that they see as strong in security in what they would regard as midstream. I too would like to see a Kerry victory but I think as at this moment it is very unlikely.</p>",
  "John Kerry, alarmed by a post-convention surge in the opinion polls for President George Bush, relaunched his campaign yesterday after taking the advice of Bill Clinton from his hospital bed. <p>In a 90-minute conversation from hospital, Mr Clinton was reported yesterday to have sketched out a detailed strategy to revive Mr Kerry's candidacy, warning him to tone down the emphasis on Vietnam and to re-focus on jobs and healthcare. Mr Kerry appeared to have adopted some of his suggestions, offering up a combative Labor Day speech in Pennsylvania yesterday. </p> <p>\"If you want four more years of your wages falling ... if you want four more years of losing jobs overseas and replacing them with jobs that pay $9,000 [about \u00a35,000] less than the jobs you had before, then you should go vote for George Bush,\" he told a morning rally. </p> <p>The timing of Mr Kerry's conversation with Mr Clinton reflects the concern within the Kerry camp and among Democrats in general that the party lost precious ground to the Republicans during August, and was badly damaged by attack advertisements from a small group of Vietnam war veterans virulently opposed to Mr Kerry. </p> <p>The charges in the ads, though largely discredited, tarnished the most heroic chapter in Mr Kerry's biography - his service in Vietnam as a young navy lieutenant. The Swift Boat Veterans' allegations also prevented Mr Kerry from laying out his agenda on Iraq or the economy, miring his campaign in a debate about a war that has been over for 30 years. </p> <p>Yesterday, Mr Kerry returned to the subject of Iraq, accusing Mr Bush of sending US troops to the \"wrong war in the wrong place at the wrong time\" and said he would try to bring them all home in four years. </p> <p>In return, Mr Bush retorted: \"After voting for the war, but against funding it, after saying he would have voted for the war even knowing everything we know today, my opponent woke up this morning with new campaign advisers and yet another new position.\" </p> <p>Mr Clinton was reported to have warned Mr Kerry that he will have to wage a more aggressive campaign if he is to recoup an 11-point deficit reported by polls in Time and Newsweek at the weekend. </p> <p>The polls, during last week's Republican convention, mark the first time that Mr Bush has opened a clear lead over Mr Kerry since last spring. </p> <p>Both magazine polls found 52% of likely voters were prepared to cast their votes for Mr Bush against just 41% for Mr Kerry. Newsweek offered an even gloomier forecast for the Democrats, predicting that Mr Bush's ratings would rise even further since some of the polling was conducted before his convention address. </p> <p>Concerns about a resurgent President Bush prompted the unveiling of a new strategy at Mr Kerry's campaign headquarters at the weekend, the New York Times reported yesterday. </p> <p>The paper quoted Joel Johnson, a former Clinton White House aide who recently joined the Kerry campaign, on the new strategy. \"Bush has taken us in the wrong direction. If you want more of the same for the next four years, vote for President Bush. If you want a new direction, John Kerry and John Edwards,\" Mr Johnson told the Times. </p> <p>The political chat with Mr Clinton and a drive to recruit several of the former president's advisers to the Kerry campaign were widely seen as intended to put the Democrats back on track in the final eight weeks of the campaign. </p> <p>Yesterday, Mr Kerry turned to John Sasso to join him as a political adviser, in a move intended to beef up Mr Kerry's response to Republican attacks. Mr Sasso has known Mr Kerry for 20 years. </p> <p>Among the old Clinton hands, Mr Kerry has recruited the former White House press secretary Joe Lockhart, and a former political director, Doug Sosnik. </p> <p>Several other former Clinton aides are also expected to play a bigger role in Mr Kerry's campaign, including CNN commentators James Carville and Paul Begala, and pollster Stanley Greenberg.</p>",
  "Bill Clinton was \"recovering normally\" yesterday at a New York hospital after a quadruple bypass operation, which doctors said had probably saved him from a \"substantial\" heart attack. <p>Allan Schwartz, the head of cardiology at the New York-Presbyterian hospital said that some of the former president's arteries had been 90% blocked when he checked himself in on Friday complaining of chest pains. </p> <p>Doctors began preparations for the operation at about 6.45am local time, hours after a New York Times report revealed the hospital had the worst death rate for heart bypass surgery of all hospitals in the state. </p> <p>\"Starting this morning at about 8am, he had a relatively routine quadruple bypass operation. We left the operating room around noon and he is recovering normally at this point,\" said Craig Smith, the heart surgeon who led the operation. </p> <p>According to Dr Schwartz, Mr Clinton was awake but sedated four hours after the operation ended. He was using a breathing tube and so had not yet spoken. </p> <p>The president's wife, Senator Hillary Clinton and his daughter, Chelsea, said they had stayed up late with the 58-year-old former president on Sunday night, talking and playing games. </p> <p>In a statement released after the operation, Senator Clinton said: \"Chelsea and I thank God and the incredible medical team and staff ... for taking such good care of my husband.\" </p> <p>Describing the past few days as \"an emotional roller-coaster for us\", she added: \"The president's optimism and faith will carry him through the difficult weeks and months ahead, of that we have no doubt.\" </p> <p>The family thanked the thousands of people who had expressed their good wishes, including Tony Blair, President George Bush and 26,000 people who sent messages of support through Mr Clinton's website. </p> <p>Addressing a campaign rally in Missouri, President Bush told a crowd of supporters: \"His surgery went well, which is good news, and we just pray for a speedy recovery for the former president.\" </p> <p>It was not clear yesterday when Mr Clinton would be able to rejoin the campaign to oust Mr Bush. Mr Clinton had promised to be a \"foot soldier\" for John Kerry, the Democratic challenger, and had planned a full schedule of appearances to help turn out the party faithful. </p> <p>Doctors said he will remain in the hospital for four or five days and should recover fully within two to three months. He is expected to be out of intensive care within a day.</p>",
  "If the polls are right, and I begin to think that they might be, then George Bush will be re-elected in November. And we on the left and centre-left of politics will somehow have to account for it. Popular explanations will include a rubbish Democrat campaign, corporate campaign money, the machinations of the rightwing media, Republican dirty tricks and - above all - the suggestion that Americans are dumb. Today we're doing dumb. <p>The argument goes something like this. Bush and the Republicans stand for policies that actively and rather obviously damage the ordinary American. If Jo Schmo was in her right mind she would realise what was going on and vote John Kerry. She won't, so she isn't. Therefore her behaviour and beliefs are so out of trim with her \"natural\" interests and her \"real\" experience that her consciousness, as Marx would have said, is false. </p> <p>A couple of weeks ago a book was published in America that elaborated on exactly this theme. What's the Matter with Kansas? by Thomas Frank gazes on \"a panorama of madness and delusion worthy of Hieronymous Bosch\". In this Bedlam of irrational behaviour - the state where the working-classes vote Republican - small farmers vote themselves off the land, proud parents ensure that their kids will never get to college or afford good healthcare and stolid factory-workers vote for closures and regional decline. </p> <p>But why do they do this? There must be a reason. Frank finds it, essentially, in Christian fundamentalism. The Republicans offer to sell homophobia, anti-feminism and covert racism to the dumb folks of Kansas, but what they actually buy is big-business liberalism and globalisation. They are gulled by the oldest trick of all, the one that gets the victim to look somewhere else. </p> <p>But suppose, for a moment, that the Kansas voters aren't so dumb. Suppose, first, that they don't buy the economic prospectus unwittingly along with the social populism, but consciously because they actually agree with it - because (and this hurts) it does actually tie in with their concrete experience. In other words, their consciousness is not false at all. Why might a poor person be opposed to tax increases and social benefits? Possibly because they hope to be richer themselves, maybe because they believe that high benefits are a disincentive to work and conceivably they believe both because that is exactly what they see happening around them - folks getting rich and folks idling. </p> <p>We, of course, tend not to look at things in this harsh way. But as the best book I have read recently about the US - The Right Nation: Why America is Different, by John Mickelthwait and Adrian Wooldridge - points out, American history and optimism are different. If you want, say, Hispanic votes, you don't go on about welfare - Mexican immigrants aren't big on it. </p> <p>And European social democrats have to concede that there is such a thing as a disincentive to work. As Will Hutton pointed out, writing about Germany in last Sunday's Observer, one \"vital prerequisite to restoring German economic health\" is for the authorities to \"stop offering what amounts to a generous pension for life\", cutting it down to something that tides people over between jobs. </p> <p>Then there's the question of the alternative. If the problem, as formulated by one Democrat commentator, is that the Republicans \"destroy the farm subsidies that have kept family farms out of the hands of giant, corporate mega-farms, deregulate every industry including the once dominant aircraft industry, and ship the rest of the jobs overseas or get underpaid migrant labour to fill the positions,\" then the answers would appear to be to increase farm subsidies, tightly regulate domestic aircraft production, increase protectionism and place restrictions on migrant labour. </p> <p>This is a formulation that would find favour with Pat Buchanan and the populist palaeo-conservatives, but it is hardly likely to resonate with modern voters who surmise - rightly - that the outside world cannot be locked out. It would also not find much favour with us here in Europe. </p> <p>No, the problem is the same problem as it always is really - giving people something better and believable to vote for. Starting from where they are. </p> <p> <b> Why passionate Prince Philip is Jung at heart</b> </p> <p>Not for the first time since being dis-elected by the people of Chester in 1997, the wit and former Tory MP Gyles Brandreth has come up with a fabulous image - one to warm the coldest pillow. It's of the Duke of Edinburgh passionately discussing great works of psychology with the nubile Duchess of Abercorn. </p> <p>\"I think it was at The Gables - when Nicky was running the shoots,\" Sacha Abercorn told Brandreth, \"that we particularly got interested in each other. What brought us together? Jung. Yes, Jung. I've always been interested in Jung, his work, his ideas. And Philip is interested in Jung. Prince Philip is always questing, exploring, searching for meaning, testing ideas. We had rivet ing conversations about Jung. That's where our friendship began.\" </p> <p>And - in terms of intimacy - ended, according to Lady Abercorn, refuting the claims of royal biographer, the Viscountess Bangor (sic) that, \"Philip and Sacha Abercorn certainly had an affair. Without a doubt\". And let's believe her and forget the salacious gossip because (a) we are too high-minded and (b) no one knows anything anyway. Being a newspaper of ideas we will concentrate instead on the prince and the psychotherapist and the question, why might a dry old \"pull yourself together\" stick like the Dook have an intellectual thing for Jung? </p> <p>First off, Jung isn't Freud. Rightwing nationalists hate Sigmund, but they quite like Carl Gustav because he believed that the unconscious was split into two parts, the individual and the collective. And it's a culturally specific collective unconscious, at that. So Swedes might be imbued with unconscious Vikings, and Bushmen with unconscious bush-trackers (Laurens Van Der Post loved Jung). In the 30s, Jung even described the God Wotan as \"the truest expression and unsurpassed personification of a fundamental quality that is particularly characteristic of the Germans.\" If Wotan, why not Windsor? If you were part of an unelected national dynasty, wouldn't you find attractive the notion of an unconscious that binds together a people and its myths? </p> <p>Then there's Jung's repudiation of Freud's idea of the libido. \"I can understand very well,\" wrote Jung, \"that Freud's ... reduction of everything psychic to primitive sexual wishes and power-drives has something about it that is beneficial and satisfying to the Jew, because it is a form of simplification.\" Jung preferred a libido where the sheer will to live substituted for sexual desire as the main driving force. </p> <p>Which brings us back to the boudoir. Imagine these two gazing at each other, the Duke and someone else's Duchess, both feeling that intense, that overwhelming, that passionate will to live.</p>"
