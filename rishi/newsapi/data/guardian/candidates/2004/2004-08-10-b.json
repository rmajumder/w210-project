  "Any British voter who hesitated between the candidates of the Labour party and one of the anti-war parties this spring will appreciate the dilemma facing some US citizens in November. The threat from Ralph Nader's independent campaign to the chances of the Democrats' John Kerry seems fairly obvious - except to Mr Nader himself, who insists that he will take more votes from George Bush. He has certainly taken campaign contributions from the Republicans, even if the sums involved are comparatively small - a total of $50,000 out of the $1m he has raised overall. Mr Nader has also been endorsed in several states by the rightwing Reform party, while in Michigan, Republicans collected 43,000 signatures for his nomination. <p>The aim of such moves is transparent: to divide the anti-Bush forces and chip away at the Kerry vote where it matters most. In Florida of \"hanging chad\" fame, where the average of latest polls shows Mr Kerry just three points in the lead, Mr Nader's projected 2% could become crucial in November. With memories still raw of Mr Nader's intervention last time, the Democratic machine is fighting back. On Monday, Democrats went to court in Pennsylvania claiming cases of fraud in Mr Nader's nomination papers; legal challenges are being mounted elsewhere, including in Florida itself. </p> <p>Mr Nader accuses the Democrats of organising \"dirty tricks\" against his campaign and says that Republicans hedging their bets contribute on a much greater scale to Democratic coffers. He is running, he says, against \"the corporate interests that dominate both parties\" and it is not the job of an independent candidate to ensure that one party wins or loses. More controversially, he also rejects the accusation that he \"cost Al Gore\" the last election: he claims to have appealed then, and now, to many who would otherwise not vote at all. Democracy, he insists, needs someone who can ensure that the issues which Washington insiders try to hide will get raised \"all the way to election day\". </p> <p>This is certainly not an unprincipled argument - but does it apply in the exceptional circumstances of this election? Mr Kerry's flaws and limitations are evident; but they are put in the shade by the neo-conservative agenda and catastrophic war-making of Mr Bush. This is an election in which almost the whole world will breathe a sigh of relief if the incumbent is defeated. Radical voices such as Noam Chomsky advocate voting for Mr Nader in \"safe states\" where Mr Bush cannot win. Well, maybe. Elsewhere, though, the stakes are too high.</p>",
  "The US president, George Bush, announced today that Republican congressman Porter Goss will take over as the new director of the embattled CIA. <p>Mr Goss, the head of the intelligence committee in the House of Representatives, is set to replace George Tenet, who resigned amid accusations that the CIA had failed to respond appropriately to the terrorist threat in advance of the September 11, 2001 attacks on New York and Washington.</p> <p>The agency was also slated for overstating the nature of the threat from former Iraqi dictator, Saddam Hussein, particularly the CIA's belief that he possessed weapons of mass destruction. </p> <p>Mr Tenet left the post on July 11, leaving his deputy, John McLaughlin, as acting director. Mr Goss still needs to be confirmed by the Senate. </p> <p>Mr Goss, 65, a representative from Florida and a former army intelligence operative, has served on the House intelligence committee for nine years. Earlier this month, the committee began hearings to look at the recommendations of the 9/11 commission, which had strongly criticised the CIA's performance in the run up to September 11.</p> <p>One of the headline findings of the 9/11 Commission was that the intelligence community had lacked the \"imagination\" to piece together evidence and assess the growing threat from al-Qaida. </p> <p>In a statement last month, Mr Goss said: \"Ultimately, I agree with [the commission], that we need to think more creatively about the threat we face, the enemy we need to defeat.\"</p> <p>The 9/11 commissions recommended the creation of a new intelligence tsar who would work from the White House and oversee the activities of the CIA and more than a dozen other intelligence agencies. </p> <p>Mr Bush said he would created the new post, but would distance it from the West Wing, causing some to wonder if the new intelligence director would have the necessary clout to institute reform. </p> <p>\"We cannot afford to make changes blindly, or in unnecessary haste ... The unintended consequences of an action we take could wreak havoc upon our ability to protect against the next attack,\" Mr Goss said earlier this month.</p> <p>If confirmed, Mr Goss would be only the second congressman to serve as CIA director, after George Bush Sr. He may prove too political an appointment for the Democrats. Senator Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia, the Democratic vice chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, had previously said he would not support someone from Congress as CIA director. </p> <p>Carl Levin, a Democratic member of the Senate intelligence committee, appeared to echo those concerns.</p> <p>\"Some of our greatest failures in the intelligence area over the last several years - particularly the massive intelligence failures before the war in Iraq - appear to have been the result of the shaping of intelligence reporting by the intelligence community to support the policies of the administration in powe,\" he said.</p> <p>\"I believe that objective, independently arrived at intelligence assessments are a matter of vital national importance. That will be a major focus for me both in the consideration of proposed reforms of the intelligence community and in my assessment of the Goss nomination.\"</p>",
  "The lack of an appreciable post-convention \"bounce\" in John Kerry's poll ratings is significant. The Democratic party's Boston shindig last month was supposed to present him as a strong, experienced replacement for President George Bush. But Boston's main achievement may have been to highlight the limitations and flaws of Kerry's candidacy. <p>The eviction of a White House incumbent is always an uphill struggle. It requires something special. Bill Clinton possessed that indefinable quality in 1992. </p> <p>If Kerry lacks Bubba's bounce, it may simply be because he is not, well, very bouncy. </p> <p>In truth, Kerry is not a lot of things. When it comes to participatory politics, he is not a natural; while worthy of respect, he is not loveable. </p> <p>He is no ordinary American. His money, upbringing and privileged Washington and New England existence separate him from the mass, marking him down as member of the east coast elite. </p> <p>Most of all, however, Kerry is not Bush, which is the principal reason why he holds the nomination. </p> <p>From Iowa onwards, it became evident that Democratic primary voters were picking Kerry not because he enthused them but because they felt he could win. </p> <p>Yet that is no reason to excuse Kerry's policy positions from more considered scrutiny. A central, underpinning theme is his attempt to present himself as a unifier in contrast to Bush's perceived divisiveness. </p> <p>But analysis of his campaign contributor base, for example, suggests otherwise. According to data gleaned from independent campaign watchdogs by the Washington Post, Kerry's donor base is overwhelmingly bi-coastal. </p> <p>He dominates in California and New York; Bush eclipses him in middle America. </p> <p>Although Kerry claims to have significant business backing, Bush leads massively in terms of campaign contributions from company presidents and chairmen. </p> <p>Conversely, Kerry has an almost total lock on contributions from professors, social workers, authors, actors, librarians, journalists and gays. </p> <p>In this sense at least, Kerry's candidacy is entrenching America's divisions, expressed in hard cash. </p> <p>A closer look at his policy platform also reveals the fault-lines in his overall appeal. Much of what he proposes on healthcare, education, taxes and deficit reduction is familiar to the point of being mundane. </p> <p>There is no \"big idea\", no reason to believe a Kerry presidency will make a difference in these areas. </p> <p>The rest is often vague and unpersuasive. On Iraq, as the Republicans rightly say, Kerry is disingenuous. </p> <p>Apart from a more consultative approach, he offers no clue as to why US allies should suddenly change their minds about contributing more troops and money. </p> <p>While he is right to make an issue out of America's addiction to foreign, especially Middle Eastern, oil, he offers no clear cure. </p> <p>His prescription - which includes tax credits for fuel-efficient vehicles and greater emphasis on renewable energy - will, even if enacted, have little or no impact over the lifetime of a four-year presidency. </p> <p>On trade, his vow to safeguard American jobs and to review all treaties has a nationalistic, almost protectionist, feel. </p> <p>On the other hand, he gives little thought to the developing world's trade priorities and poverty reduction goals. </p> <p>On Israel-Palestine, Kerry appears to promise a continuation of the Bush administration's lopsided approach. </p> <p>In a speech to the Anti-Defamation League last May, he pledged \"never\" to pressurise Israel to compromise its security, \"never\" to push it into unwanted peace agreements, and \"never\" to halt US political, military and eco nomic aid. </p> <p>It would have been refreshing to see him offer similar guarantees to the Palestinians. </p> <p>On terrorism, WMD proliferation and defence, as his Boston address made plain, Kerry is bent on hanging tough with the toughest, promising - in sum - to prosecute the same, endless, unconfined \"war\" that Bush declared after 9/11 while somehow rendering it more acceptable to Muslims and Europeans.</p> <p>For example, he would open direct talks with Iran. But he would also double US army special forces and train them specifically to infiltrate countries (such as Iran) tasked with \"finding and destroying the most dangerous weapons before they can be used against us\". </p> <p>Even Dubya has not yet dared go that far. Paradoxically, Kerry is likely, overall, to be a non-interventionist in the Clinton mould. </p> <p>Those who understandably desire, above all else, to see the back of Bush should not be blind to the weaknesses of his would-be replacement. </p> <p>If Kerry wins, all this will suddenly matter an awful lot. </p> <p>This November, it may come down to a choice between being bombed or bored to death. Bush can be relied upon for the high explosive. </p> <p>From Kerry and his \"band of brothers\" comes a whole new brand of blather. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:s.tisdall@theguardian.com\">s.tisdall@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Ralph Nader, the consumers' champion who became the scourge of Democrats for his determination to run for US president, faced a concerted challenge yesterday to his candidacy in a battleground state. <p>In two separate lawsuits, Democratic activists in Pennsylvania sought to keep Mr Nader off November's ballot. </p> <p>The move intensifies the war between Republicans and Democrats over Mr Nader's candidacy, a conflict fuelled by the maverick's willingness to accept funds and help from some of George Bush's most ardent supporters. </p> <p>Republicans are eager to see Mr Nader do well - not because of his stand on the environment or Iraq - but in the hope that he will tip the balance towards Mr Bush in the race against John Kerry, the Democratic challenger. But the Democrats have stood their ground, with activists harrying Mr Nader's effort to get on the ballot in several states. </p> <p>In the Pennsylvania lawsuits Democrats accused the Nader campaign of falsifying thousands of names on petitions endorsing his candidacy in the Philadelphia and Pittsburgh areas. His campaign was also accused of failing to pay the contractors who organised the petition and who allegedly paid homeless people a dollar for each signature. </p> <p>A spokesman for Mr Nader said only petition gatherers who turned in fraudulent signatures were unpaid. </p> <p>The Democrats took Pennsylvania by a relatively slim margin during the last election and party activists defended the law suits against Mr Nader yesterday. </p> <p>\"The bottom line for us is that we are partisan Democrats, and we are very much interested in getting John Kerry elected,\" said Michael Manzo, aide to a Democratic state legislator. \"We view Mr Nader's candidacy as a threat. Will it be a large threat? We hope not, but we are not willing to take any chances.\" </p> <p>Similar scenarios are unfolding in other states with Democrats fighting a rearguard action to keep Mr Nader out of the presidential race. </p> <p>In the battleground state of Arizona he was knocked off the ballot on a technicality, and the party is raising funds for legal challenges in Florida, Michigan, West Virginia and Nevada. </p> <p>Mr Nader dismissed the challenges as a display of insecurity. \"It shows the lack of confidence Democrats have in their own candidate,\" he told Businessweek magazine. </p> <p>However, among Mr Nader's new supporters this election is the billionaire Richard Egan, who was appointed ambassador to Ireland after raising hundreds of thousands of dollars for President Bush. Campaign monitors say other big Republican donors have contributed as well. In Oregon, also poised for a tight contest, two conservative groups admitted telephoning supporters to help put Mr Nader on the ticket. </p> <p>But even with the new-found patrons, he has made slow progress in his effort to get on state ballots. He missed a chance to get on the ballot in California at the weekend when supporters raised only half the 153,000 signatures required. </p> <p>But Democrats say that was Mr Nader's due when he decided to contest these elections, reopening the feud on the American left begun when Mr Nader drained off crucial support for Al Gore in the 2000 elections, handing Mr Bush his victory. </p> <p>With memories of that defeat still rankling, even some of Mr Nader's closest associates were outraged when he announced his candidacy earlier this year. </p> <p>That anger grew further when Mr Nader rebuffed a request from Mr Kerry to stay out of the race in key states. </p> <p>That is when the Democratic machine stepped in with Howard Dean, a hero to the party's left wing for his anti-war stance, deployed to herd wayward Democrats. </p> <p>One of Mr Dean's aides from his failed campaign for the Democratic leadership founded a website called the Nader Factor which documents Republican support for Mr Nader. </p> <p>Mr Nader is not expected to match the 2.8m votes he won last time. But some like John Zogby, the Democratic pollster, say that hardly matters. </p> <p>He said Mr Nader could hold the balance in several states - should he succeed in getting on the ballot. </p> <p>But his candidacy presents another challenge for the Democrats. </p> <p>\"He is the ghost of the left, he is the one who rallies the anti-war sentiment and Democratic populism, and so his presence in the race is casting a shadow on Kerry,\" Mr Zogby said. </p> <p>\"It's not going to be enough for him just not to be George Bush.\"</p> <p><b>States of flux </b></p> <p>A poll last week had Kerry on 48%, Bush 43%, and Nader 3%. If Nader gets on the ballots, and taking into account polls' margins of error, he can turn several states, including: </p> <p><b>Florida </b><br>Kerry 1% up on Bush <br>Nader 1.5% </p> <p><b>Minnesota </b><br>Kerry 1% up on Bush <br>Nader 2% </p> <p><b>New Hampshire </b><br>Kerry 4% up on Bush <br>Nader 4% </p> <p><b>Pennsylvania </b><br>Kerry 5% up on Bush <br>Nader 5% </p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>Source: Zogby International, Mason Dixon, the University of New Hampshire</p>",
  "<p>Bernard Levin, who has died aged 75, after many years of Alzheimer's disease, was one of the most famous as well as one of the most controversial British journalists and broadcasters of the second half of the last century. His ever-restless pen provoked emotions that varied from rage, even hatred, to affection and admiration. Employed during the last three decades primarily on the Times and the Sunday Times, his career had also taken him to such publications as the Observer, the Manchester Guardian, the Spectator, the New Statesman, the Daily Mail and the Daily Express. </p> <p>Bernard's mother was the daughter of Ukrainian Jewish emigrants. His father, of Lithuanian extraction, a St Pancras tailor, left her shortly after Bernard's birth in London. Bernard met him only once when he was at university. The family lived in Camden Town and Bernard was brought up, though not strictly, in the Jewish faith. His illiterate grandparents' stories about life in Russia must have instilled in him the passionate belief in the freedom of the individual that lasted his whole life. In return, as he grew older, he used to read to them. Bernard could not read Hebrew, but he could get by in Yiddish. </p> <p>He was a bright child and won a London County Council scholarship to Christ's Hospital, the charity boarding school in Horsham, West Sussex, where he was to experience, for the first time, being mocked in the street and to encounter strong attacks on his opinions. Merely getting to the school was an ordeal, as the sight of a small boy in his uniform with its swirling cloak and tight stockings sometimes provoked jeers. </p> <p>At the school he announced that he was a communist and set up on his desk a small collection of books from what was known as the Little Lenin Library. His fellow pupils, mostly from a very different kind of background, renamed them the Little Levin Library - eventually throwing them out of the window. </p> <p>Another scholarship, in the late 1940s, took Bernard to the London School of Economics where he was much more at home in the pervading leftwing atmosphere. He was soon very active in the student union and politics generally. He also found he could give rein to his penchant for causing mischief and for teasing authority. His impersonation of the LSE's much revered professor of political science, Harold Laski, arguing with himself, knocking down his own propositions one by one, revealing the fallacies in each, was evidently a tour de force. </p> <p>Briefly, after graduation in 1952, he worked as a guide on coach tours, doubtless providing the passengers with more diverse and arcane information than they had any right to expect. Soon, however, he got a job with the BBC North American Service. He had the rather menial task of having to read all the newspapers and weekly journals, cutting out pieces that might be useful to quote on the air. </p> <p>In 1953, he came across an advertisement in Truth, a weekly edited by the liberal journalist George Scott, appealing for editorial staff. At the time, Truth had a very rightwing, even anti-semitic, reputation that Scott was anxious to get rid of. Bernard arrived at their offices and explained that he was applying for a job. When the secretary told Scott the name of the applicant he was delighted by the Jewish name and said: \"Show him in, he's got a job.\" </p> <p>Shortly afterwards, Philip Oakes arrived, also for a job interview, and passed Bernard on the stairs. He mistook him for the office boy. \"He looked about 16, phenomenally clean with scrubbed nails and a coil of dark hair like a bedspring lunging from his forehead ... his suit was dark and well-cut, his handkerchief like an exploded white rose in his breast pocket. His shoes twinkled against the grubby carpet.\" </p> <p>Bernard's first piece for Truth dealt with his disillusionment with the Labour party. Soon he, Oakes and Alan Brien were all sharing an office. It was a tempestuous room. Alan was forever arguing some involved point; Bernard, always capable of doing two things at once, would be contesting the point while correcting proofs. Philip, more likely than not would be laughing at them, while pondering on a poem he was writing. </p> <p>Bernard was beginning to be noticed. During a long newspaper strike, when Truth, as one of the few publications available, enjoyed a surge in circulation, the quality of his contributions stood out. In 1954, the Spectator's then owner, Ian Gilmour, appointed Brian Inglis as the editor of the weekly. Inglis invited Bernard to be his deputy, together gradually building up a distinguished band of contributors, including Karl Miller as literary editor, Brien as theatre critic and arts editor, and Cyril Ray, the wine expert. </p> <p>In 1957, Bernard started to write the column which was to set the seal on his fame. He called it Taper. The subject was the doings of Parliament. He invented comical names for politicians - thus did the then Conservative attorney general Sir Reginald Manningham-Buller became Sir Reginald Bullying Manner. </p> <p>Apart from this column, which earned him the hatred of many MPs, he wrote separate articles commenting on the law - in particular what he saw as the folly of judges - civil servants and other public figures. These articles were frequently rash, giving one to wonder why he was never prosecuted. His ferocious attack on Lord Goddard, the vindictive Lord Chief Justice, a few days after his death in 1958 affronted many people's sense of good taste. </p> <p>Many others confirm Bernard's extraordinary ability to do two or even three things at once; holding forth on Sir Oswald Mosley while typing his column, then switching without pause to an appreciation of the opera he had seen the night before. At the same time, his concentration on himself was on occasion perilous. He told Brien one morning that at dinner in a restaurant the night before, he had been so engrossed in the story he was telling that he did not notice that a man at the opposite table had had a stroke and died until ambulance men came to gather him up. </p> <p>Bernard's capacity for mischief had by no means abated. He and Cyril Ray used to shout abuse at each other across the office, with such insults as \"little Jewish runt\". Brien recalled him going into Karl Miller's office and switching all the jackets of the books to be sent out for review so that Field Marshal Lord Montgomery was puzzled to receive not a book on military strategy, but one on the traditions of the Chinese circus. </p> <p>Considering its impact, it is a surprise to realise that the Taper column ran for only two years. Disappointed by the result of the 1959 election, which saw Harold Macmillan's Conservatives register a third election victory in succession, with a majority of more than 100, Bernard came to dislike Macmillan more and more, believing that he should, and would be thrown out. When this did not happen, he decided to move on, at first going to the Daily Express as theatre critic, and from 1962 to 1965 working at the Daily Mail in the same capacity. He then became a Mail feature writer - and in 1969, What The Papers Say's columnist of the year. Bernard had become well aware of the fickle ways of Fleet Street and had become canny. His contract specified that he should have complete freedom and that no one should ever change anything he wrote, either for its opinion or its style, without his consent. </p> <p>But in 1963 had come a move into television that was to make him a household name. He became an important figure on BBCs late Saturday-night satire show, That Was The Week That Was, and later on its less renowned successor, Not So Much A Programme More A Way Of Life. </p> <p>His role on TW3 each week was to interview someone in the news. He did so in a way that was, then, a trifle shocking. He was one of the first TV interviewers to deploy rudeness as a technique. The result was that the public came to loathe him. In the Daily Express he even featured in a series, The Hate Makers, penned by a then prominent rightwing journalist, Robert Pitman. </p> <p>Going into the theatre, people even spat at him. Some viewers were delighted one evening, when a man strode on to the set and punched Bernard, knocking him off his stool. It was Desmond Leslie, an expert on unidentified flying objects. Bernard had given a bad review to Leslie's wife, Agnes Bernelle. Years later, Leslie came into a Dublin restaurant where Bernard was dining. They chatted for a while. Neither of them referred to the incident. </p> <p>Back at the Daily Mail, in the week of the 1970 general election, Bernard wrote on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday columns of impartial comments on the merits of both sides. For the polling day that Thursday he promised definite advice. On Wednesday evening he wrote his column saying, Vote Labour. The editor called him in and asked him to change it. He refused, reminding him of his contract. </p> <p>Next, he was summoned by Vere Harmsworth, then the proprietor's son. Again he refused to change a word. He was threatened with dismissal, but stuck to his guns. He decided to resign, but was strangely apprehensive, fearing that he would never get another job. In the event, as soon as his resignation was announced he was inundated with offers. Characteristically, he turned down the Guardian on the grounds that he was too much in agreement with their views. He chose the Times, then edited by William Rees-Mogg, where he was to stay until the end of his life. </p> <p>There were many contradictions in Bernard's character. He saw himself as a strong man, physically. When we went to the opera together and there was no possibility of my getting up the stairs, he would insist on carrying me in the way that more brawny friends would do. Once, in the office, he was boasting that he could pick up the journalist Jackie Gillott and whirl her round his head. Instead she threw him to the floor, which did not prevent their being friends. </p> <p>For a man of such erudition who took so passionate an interest in literature and had so consuming a feeling for music, he had surprisingly little visual taste. </p> <p>This lack of taste was most noticeable in his clothes. He loved dressing up in the evening, always wearing to the opera a swirling cloak lined with bright-coloured silk. He imposed this taste on to the women he took with him. When he arrived to pick them up, he brought with him a spray of flowers which they had to pin on their dress, or sometimes, even more embarrassing, a garland for their hair. So fussy was he that he once suggested Katherine Whitehorn go home to change because one of her stockings had a ladder. </p> <p>Equally strange were his insecurities. He never learned to drive, and this could upset him. Being driven by a woman to Glyndebourne, he became convinced that other drivers were sneering at him. He asked her to stop, went into a chemist and bought a sling. He put it on, reasoning that people would now understand why he was not at the wheel. </p> <p>His life in those times was very agreeable. He had an exceptionally wide circle of friends who, for some reason, he kept in separate compartments, a characteristic common perhaps to bachelors. No one was better at keeping his friendship in repair. He never lost or fell out with a friend. His generosity was exceptional, only with great reluctance allowing anyone else to pay for a meal with him. When Cyril Ray's house burnt down, Bernard offered to lend him a large sum to tide him over. </p> <p>Bernard's romantic nature meant that he was usually in love, but wary of commitment. He had a succession of women friends whom he spoilt with lavish presents. In the bedroom he was enthusiastic, but excessively modest, always locking the bathroom door when having a bath, never letting a girl see him naked. In some moods, he never wanted to marry. He and I sat listening to a wife's tearful account of the wrenching break-up of her marriage. When she left us, Bernard said, \"And then people ask me why I don't get married.\" </p> <p>Towards the end of the 1970s, Bernard entered on a strange phase. He fell more in love than ever before with Arianna Stassinopoulos (now Arianna Huffington, and a political commentator in California). Through her he became involved in an organisation called Insight. Part of its ritual was to encourage each other to act out their fantasies. There were stories of Bernard's dressing up in a tutu that boggled the minds of his friends. </p> <p>Thus did he invite some 80 members of his circle to an evening at the Cafe Royale, at which he encouraged us to enrol. It was a strange experience to hear this paragon of logic, sceptical of all humbug trotting out stories that normally he would have scoffed at. At the end of it my neighbour turned to me and said, \"I feel I have lost a friend tonight.\" </p> <p>This embracing of odd ideas led him on to writing articles in praise of the spurious guru Bagwan Rajneesh. It was part of a recurring pattern which led him to support figures he should have detested such as Richard Nixon and his vice-president Spiro Agnew. </p> <p>There are those who believe that the edge of his writing was blunted thereafter. Against that, Alan Wood feels that Insight gave him a measure of confidence, so that he was no longer so vulnerable and no longer shuddered when strangers approached him in the street. A thread of self-doubt ran through the fabric of his life. </p> <p>A quarter of a century ago, Arianna organised a 50th birthday party for him in the south of France. For once, all his disparate friends of all ages were gathered together for this lavish occasion. Wood recalls how many people told him that day that when they had been ill how Bernard had visited them in hospital. \"He was the great visitor.\" </p> <p>Bernard certainly wanted to marry Arianna. She agreed, but made conditions. Somehow, it never materialised. She went to America. </p> <p>In some senses, he had mellowed. He enjoyed the best relations with successive editors of the Times. They liked and admired him for several qualities, loyalty being the most outstanding. His capacity for work was legendary: if he was going away for a few weeks, he would write 12 articles to be used in his absence. Difficulties could arise through his sensitivity about his work and his great reluctance to talk about any problems that he had in his writing, even though he was worried that he was stuck in a series of ruts and was specialising in about five subjects. Gradually, he came to write fewer vituperative articles and more ruminative ones on music (especially Wagner), literature and the arts, though never forsaking his pet hates - lawyers, especially judges, and home secretaries, nor his second love after music - food. </p> <p>Bernard's books included collections of his columns for The Times - the column being his natural form. But there were others too, The Pendulum Years (1971) a history of the 1960s, Conducted Tour (1981), a survey of the music festivals of Europe, and in 1985 he undertook a walk across Spain and France which led to In Hannibal's Footsteps, an informative and entertaining account of his walk and the places he passed through. He followed this with The End Of The Rhine (1987), another excellent account of a walk down the length of the river. A Walk Up Fifth Avenue (1989) was not so successful. His last book, published in 1998, was Enough Said. He became a CBE in 1990. </p> <p>A decade ago, Bernard mentioned to his friends that he was suffering from some unidentifiable illness. Indeed, it was plain to see. Five years passed before he revealed what many had suspected, that he had Alzheimer's disease. The fates could never have devised a more cruel torment for a man who prided himself on his memory, who could without fail dredge up the most apt quotation from his prodigious store of reading. </p> <p>For his friends, it was unbearably painful to watch his struggle to retrieve even the simplest word. He was lovingly supported and encouraged by his devoted friend Elizabeth Anderson. </p> <p>He is survived by his sister who lives with her family in America. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Henry Bernard Levin, journalist, born August 19, 1928; died August 7, 2004 Quentin Crewe died in 1998, and the above obituary has been revised.</p>"
