  "Less than 24 hours after it was disclosed that former secretary of state James Baker and the Carlyle Group were involved in a secret deal to profit from Iraq's debt to Kuwait, NBC was reporting that the deal was \"dead\". At The Nation magazine, which broke the story that was then carried on these pages, we started to get congratulatory calls. <p>They were commending us for costing the Carlyle Group $1bn, the sum the company would have received in an investment from the government of Kuwait in exchange for helping to extract $27bn of unpaid debts from Iraq. </p> <p>We were flattered (sort of), until we realised that Carlyle had just pulled off a major PR coup. When the story broke, the notoriously secretive merchant bank needed to find a way to avoid a full-blown political scandal. It chose a bold tactic: in the face of overwhelming evidence of a glaring conflict of interest between Baker's stake in Carlyle and his post as George Bush's special envoy on Iraq's debt, Carlyle simply denied everything. The company issued a statement saying that it does not want to be involved in the Kuwait deal \"in any way, shape or form and will not invest any money raised by the consortium's efforts\" and, furthermore, that \"Carlyle was never a member of the consortium\". A spokesperson told the Financial Times that Carlyle had pulled out as soon as Baker was appointed debt envoy, because his new political post made Carlyle's involvement \"unsuitable\". </p> <p>Mysteriously, there was no paper trail - just Carlyle's word that it had informed its business partners \"orally\". You have to hand it to them: it was gutsy. In the leaked business proposal from the consortium to the Kuwaiti government - submitted almost two months after James Baker's appointment - the Carlyle Group is named no fewer than 47 times; it is listed first among the companies involved in the consortium; and its partner James Baker is mentioned by name at least 11 times. In interviews, other consortium members, including Madeleine Albright's consulting firm, the Albright Group, confirmed that Carlyle was still involved, as did the office of the Prime Minister of Kuwait. Shahameen Sheikh, the consortium's CEO, told me that when Baker was named envoy in December, Carlyle was \"very clear with us that they wanted to restrict their role to fund managers\", but she said the firm was very much still a part of the deal. </p> <p>That was exactly what Carlyle spokesman Christopher Ullman had told me. He also admitted that Carlyle would land a $1bn investment if the proposal was accepted. After I reported these facts, Ullman even called to thank me for quoting him accurately. So when I heard about Carlyle's about-face, I called Ullman to see what was up. I felt like I was talking to one of the brainwashed characters in The Manchurian Candidate, the Jonathan Demme remake about a Carlyle-esque company that conspires to put a mind-controlled candidate in the Oval Office. \"We learned today that we did not even join the consortium,\" Ullman told me. \"When I spoke to you yesterday, I did not know that.\" Amazingly, it worked. The story - which made front-page news around the world - vanished. </p> <p>The New York Times has not printed a word about Baker's conflict, despite the fact that when Baker was first appointed envoy, it called on him to resign from Carlyle in order to \"perform honourably in his new public job\". The Kerry campaign has been equally silent, apparently for fear that any criticism would boomerang onto the Democrats because of Albright. This was Carlyle's stroke of genius: when Baker was appointed, the consortium recruited Albright to front the deal; when they got caught, Carlyle denied all involvement and left a prominent Democrat holding the bag. As the story disappeared under Carlyle's spell, it was as if the entire US media had been implanted with Manchurian memory chips. Here was hard evidence that the Carlyle Group - the \"ex-presidents' club\", run like a secret society - had participated in a scheme to use Baker to undermine US policy, possibly in violation of conflict-of-interest regulations, including criminal statutes. Yet Carlyle was slipping out of reach once again. </p> <p>The central question remains unanswered by the White House: have Baker's business interests compromised his performance as debt envoy? That question does not go away simply because $1bn will stay in the coffers of a wealthy oil emirate rather than in a Carlyle equity fund. The week after losing the deal, Carlyle handed a record-breaking $6.6bn payout to investors. </p> <p>In Iraq, the last 18 months have been markedly worse, and the stakes for Baker's job performance there are considerably higher. This was underlined on October 13, when Iraq's health ministry issued a harrowing report on its post-invasion health crisis, including outbreaks of typhoid and TB and soaring child and mother mortality rates. A week after the report, Iraq paid out another $195m for war reparation debts, mostly to Kuwait. Meanwhile, the state department announced that $3.5bn for water, sanitation and electricity projects was being shifted to security in Iraq, claiming that, according to deputy secretary of state Richard Armitage, debt relief is on the way. </p> <p>Is it? In fact, Iraq is being plunged deeper into debt, with $836m in new loans and grants now flowing from the IMF and the World Bank. Meanwhile, Baker has not managed to get a single country to commit to eradicating Iraq's debts. Iraq's creditors know that while Baker was asking them to show forgiveness, his company was offering Kuwait a special side deal to push Iraq to pay up. It's not the kind of news that tends to generate generosity and goodwill. And the timing couldn't be worse: the Paris Club is about to meet to hash out a final deal on Iraq's debt. </p> <p>But that doesn't happen until November 17. And if 2000 is any indication, by then Baker could be on to bigger deals. Look out for him in swing states, if another election needs stealing. </p> <p>A version of this column was first published in The Nation <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com\">www.thenation.com</a></p>",
  "I am, as some Guardian readers know, just about the only gay in this village. When it came time to decide for or against the invasion of Iraq, the huge majority of my colleagues could not support it, and many bitterly opposed it. But I could not oppose the removal of Saddam and this, to say the least, has left me exposed - though increasingly tempted to flaunt my political perversion in the faces of the many detractors. <p>So when Tom Wolfe says that he wants George Bush to win the election because of those who are against the cowboy oil-chimp from Hades, I get it. I have had it with the people who try to \"understand\" those zealots who blow up women trying to register to vote in Afghanistan but are horrified by born-again Christians going to church in Grand Rapids. I have had it with Chiraciennes, Pinterites, Palaeo-conservatives, Zarqawi-symps, isolationists, Srebrenica-avoiders, conspiracy theorists, know-nothings, low-level Jew-dislikers, former Conservative foreign secretaries, the anything-we-do-is-wrong army, the let's-do-nothing brigade and those who cannot wait for China to compete with the US as an equal superpower. </p> <p>On domestic grounds, if I were an American I would always vote for the Democrats, for abortion rights, help for the poor, equal treatment for minorities and a new health-care system. But what I care about, more even than these questions, is the fumbling towards a new world order, a new United Nations, a state of things where we are ashamed not to help and not to intervene, and conscious that our negligence will cost us dear in the end, from Palestine to the Congo. </p> <p>Right now, in Iraq, a disparate bunch of extraordinarily brave men and women are trying to bring about a new future. They are Shia clerics, communists, academics, trade unionists, Kurdish autonomists and even some feminists. The kind of people that George Galloway, who supped with the Saddamites even as these others languished in jail, calls - using his trademark moral inversion - \"quislings\". They're the ones who will be risking everything to register their compatriots to vote, to formulate a new constitution and give birth to a new Middle East. No wonder then, that other corrupt regimes and violent bigots so loathe them. </p> <p>So why vote for Kerry? Hasn't he flip-flopped? Hasn't he tried to cuddle up to the smooth while rejecting the rough? Wasn't this the wrong war, in the wrong place at the wrong time? So isn't his strategy going to be all about exit? </p> <p>I was reminded the other day by an American blogger of how things went in the last war but two - the one in the Balkans. Clinton was the cowboy bomber then (you remember, CND-niks - to divert us all from the dress and the cigar), and the Republicans were against. The Senate majority leader Trent Lott described involvement in Kosovo as a \"quagmire\". Diplomacy, the Republicans argued, had not been given a chance. </p> <p>In 1999, at the height of the Kosovan crisis the chief political correspondent of the web magazine Slate predicted that, \"You can be sure of only two things: Each party is arguing exactly the opposite of what it argued the last time a Republican president led the nation into war, and exactly the opposite of what it will argue next time.\" He had that right. Even here in Britain an opposition that consistently urged action against Saddam from 1998 to 2003, without once demanding evidence, now discovers that it was somehow being duped all along. Well, Michael, that's politics. </p> <p>And actually Kerry has been better than that. Many of his objections to the war have concerned the extraordinary incompetence of the planning and execution of the occupation. Not enough troops, the absence of proper plans, the hubristic assumptions about the postwar period, the vile own-goal of the Abu Ghraib torture revelations - a scandal for which no one in the administration, despite its symbolic importance, has taken personal responsibility. </p> <p>The administration has, understandably, made a great virtue of its determination. But, as anyone who finds themselves debating with a Bushite will attest, you soon get to the point when judgment is clouded over by rhetoric and argument obscured by assertion. The opponents are all Ba'athists, the UN is a sink of corruption, those who are not with us are against us. They kick up the dust and obscure the path and Kerry is right, we need to be more intelligent and more focused than this. </p> <p>I believe that - because they see the world the way I do - American Democrats will not let down Iraqi democrats. I believe that Kerry is in a better position to seek help and support from the rest of the world. I believe he is a more thoughtful man than Bush, and I believe that that thoughtfulness is what we now need. I hope that by midday tomorrow John Kerry will be the next American president. </p> <p><b>Are you wearing your poppy yet? If not, why not?</b></p> <p>On Sunday, just before we went on air, the presenter of the programme for which I was punditting along the lines above was told by the gallery that she had to wear a Remembrance poppy. She dashed out, had one fixed to her jacket, and ran back. Unfortunately this left her two guests conspicuously poppyless and there will, I know from experience, be a couple of letters on their way to me right now complaining of our lack of respect for our fallen soldiers. </p> <p>Yesterday morning the new all-tabloid Times carried what appeared to be a small and angry-looking zit on its masthead. Inspection with a magnifying glass revealed the pustule to be another teeny-weeny poppy. A larger, more confident one adorned the London Evening Standard. Yet there was more than a week to go before November 11. </p> <p>Poppy-wearing is fine by me. People now make what they want out of such institutions, choosing for themselves whether they are commemorating our glorious dead, or mourning the futility of war. It is a bit like wearing a one-minute silence. You can think what you like while you stand there, head bowed. </p> <p>What is slightly coercive, however, is the increasing insistence on some outward show of inner piety - and the gradual inflation in date and length of such demonstrations. The poppy must be worn by everyone and must be worn by the end of October; the silences must now be one minute for just about anybody who has died and two minutes for someone special. </p> <p>I know where this is headed. Five years ago Halloweens at our house were a witch's hat, a badly carved pumpkin and a bag of sweets. This year there was a party for 10, ghostly lights, face- painting, half-a-dozen pumpkin sculptures of Rodinesque brilliance and - finally - a mass sortie on to the streets of north London. </p> <p>In a decade we will be wearing poppies in June, building our own porch-cenotaphs and holding half-hour silences for those members of the Light Brigade who never returned.</p>",
  "George Bush zig-zagged across the American heartland yesterday in an intensive seven-stop surge to keep his job, playing to his natural strengths: discipline and incumbency. <p>The electoral advantages of being president were vividly displayed in the rural Ohio town of Wilmington, which appeared to have been seduced by the arrival of Air Force One and the vast presidential retinue. </p> <p>Max Allen, a local farmer, woke up at 4am to witness the spectacle. \"I never saw a president before,\" he said. </p> <p>This was an ideal time. </p> <p>Every vote in this potentially decisive battleground state is precious, and no effort has been spared on either side to galvanise support. </p> <p>By six in the morning the line of cars stretched for miles around the local airport. No one could have been left unimpressed by the display waiting for them when they arrived in a packed aircraft hangar. The doors had been pulled open, framing the looming blue and white head of Air Force One like a movie screen. </p> <p>The presidential jet was there to await Mr Bush's arrival, and he appeared bang on time at 7.30am, dropping out of the clouds in one of a squadron of green marine helicopters. </p> <p>As it approached the hangar, the sound system played the grandiose theme tune to Air Force One, a thriller starring Harrison Ford as a tough, embattled president. The crowd found itself part of a movie and erupted with delight. </p> <p>The president, dressed in a bomber jacket, delivered a speech similar to one he must have repeated a thousand times. He is not an improviser. Even his jokes are the same ones he was telling when he set off on the campaign trail months ago. </p> <p>\"Sometimes, I'm a little too blunt - I get that from my mother. Sometimes I mangle the English language - I get that from my dad,\" Mr Bush said. If his hosts had heard it before, they were too awestruck to let it show. </p> <p>The laugh raised the hangar roof, and they cheered the payoff line: \"But all the time, whether you agree with me or not, you know where I stand.\" </p> <p>The campaign song also remained unchanged. It was by country singers Brooks &amp; Dunn, and belted out a simple patriotic creed: \"Only in America, Dreamin' in red, white and blue. Only in America, Where we dream as big as we want to, We all get a chance, Everybody gets to dance, Only in America.\" </p> <p>Only in America, arguably, could God and country provide such a powerful political platform. President Bush's born-again Christianity alone has probably guaranteed him a 30% bloc of the population, and that was abundantly clear in Wilmington. Mary Cales, an accountant from the nearby settlement of Sinking Springs, explained her fervour with a single concise sentence. </p> <p>\"It's probably because I'm a Christian and he is,\" she said. </p> <p>This is Bush country. </p> <p>Two thirds of the county voted for him four years ago, and his grip is still firm. He was there to inspire, so that the conservative turnout in the countryside will match the Democratic legions in Ohio's big cities. </p> <p>And if there were floating voters in the crowd they cannot fail to have been impressed by the heady sense of being in the presence of extraordinary power. Most of the crowd stayed until Air Force One had taken off and the president disappeared once more into the clouds.</p>",

  "Uruguay's first leftwing president in its 170-year history yesterday celebrated his election victory, consolidating a political swing to the left across South America. <p>Tabare Vazquez, 64, the leader of a coalition of former extreme leftwing guerrillas, socialists, communists and social democrats called the Broad Front-Progressive Encounter, won in the first round. </p> <p>Mr Vazquez polled 50.7% of the vote, the centre-right Blanco party got 34%, and the outgoing centrist Colorado party had its worst election ever with 10%. </p> <p>Mr Vazquez, a cancer doctor and the former mayor of Montevideo, told jubilant crowds: \"Celebrate, Uruguayans, celebrate. This is your victory.\" </p> <p>Supporters waving the red, white and blue flags of the Broad Front gathered beneath the balcony of the Hotel Presidente in the Uruguayan capital to hear Mr Vazquez speak. </p> <p>His victory follows similar moves to the left in Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Venezuela, Paraguay and Ecuador. </p> <p>It ends the long two-party dominance of the conservative Colorado and Blanco parties in the small South American country. Known for cattle farming and offshore banking, Uruguay has recently been battered by trade dependence on its giant neighbours, Brazil, which devalued its currency in 1998, and Argentina, whose economy collapsed in 2001. </p> <p>Argentinian withdrawals started a run on Uruguayan banks in 2002 which was overcome only by huge borrowing from international financial institutions, leaving the country with a debt equal to its $14bn annual output. </p> <p>The signs of the crisis can be seen in the unfinished construction projects, rubbish pickers and shanties that have proliferated around Montevideo, despite a boom in exports of beef, soya and agro-industrial products which means the economy is growing again at 11% this year. </p> <p>Mr Vazquez, who will take office on March 1 2005, last week said that he would \"review\" the ambitious bilateral investment treaty that his predecessor signed with the US last September. </p> <p>He has talked of finding a \"third way\" between protectionism and state-organised economic activity on one hand, and the privatisation of state-run industries and lowering of trade barriers on the other. He favours closer ties with other South American states in the Mercosur customs union, subsidised agriculture, and public works projects financed by higher taxes. </p> <p>\"The change has already started in other Latin American countries,\" Mr Vazquez told the crowd at his last rally before the vote. \"We have to stop being a rich country with a poor population.\" </p> <p>One supporter, Diego Garro, 25, said: \"We are a rich country that exports food, yet people are hungry here. Our standard of living has not improved since the 1970s. </p> <p>\"People are disillusioned with the traditional parties. They think, 'Let's give this guy a go, he can't do any worse'.\"</p>",

  "Criticisms of Americans for being insular, while often valid, usually fail to grasp the sheer scale of the place. Texas, the country's second largest state, is the size of Germany, Italy and Denmark combined; its population would fill Switzerland, Portugal and Ireland. Those who accuse Americans of being parochial must first concede that America is a huge parish. <p>New England, where I started my journey, and west Texas, where I ended it five weeks later, could be in two entirely different nations. Not only had the topography, climate and architecture radically altered, but so had the people and their attitudes towards everything from religion and government to taxes and guns. </p> <p>In that time the political landscape had changed too. I left the Democratic challenger's home town of Boston with John Kerry fighting to defend his purple hearts and stay in the race as he languished eight points behind Bush in the polls. I left Mr Bush's home town of Midland with the contest tied and Mr Bush explaining a looted weapons cache in Iraq. </p> <p>One of the few things that has remained constant while on the road has been the ubiquity of the stars and stripes. The national flag billows everywhere. It flies from porches, hangs from store fronts and decorates the bumpers of many cars ahead of me. The interstate highway, network television and chain stores aside, the ever-present national flag has been the one constant indicator that I have remained in the same country all along. </p> <p>But these demonstrations of patriotism offer little or no suggestion of which side of the political divide people are on. You are as likely to find them among Republicans as Democrats. In normal times this strong sense of national identity is the thread that keeps this diverse patchwork of states, cultures and ethnicities together. </p> <p><b>Frayed</b><br> </p> <p>But these are no normal times. Indeed, over the last month it has occasionally felt as though these threads may be becoming perilously frayed. For at its heart this election has highlighted the thorny, divisive issue of what that flag stands for. For many, at stake is not just who will run the country, but who owns it and what core values should underpin it. </p> <p>On the left are those who believe the nation is being transformed by a corporate theocracy. Trekking through the suburbs of Derry, New Hampshire, Pam and Patrick Devaney overcame their shyness to go knocking on doors in search of progressive voters. \"I'm not comfortable doing this but it has to be done,\" said Pam. \"Our democracy is at stake. This is the most important election in my lifetime.\" </p> <p>\"I always thought someone else was out there doing the job for us,\" said Patrick. \"Now I wonder what we're doing in New Jersey.\" </p> <p>On the right are those who fear the encroachment of secular liberalism. \"I fear for this country if Kerry wins,\" said Burton Kephart, from Franklin, Pennsylvania, whose son Jonathan was killed in Iraq. \"God has a plan for the ages. Bush will hold back the evil a little bit. He is a God-fearing man. He believes in praying to a God who hears his prayers. He's a leader.\" </p> <p>Many Americans, of course, lie in between these two extremes. Like the hotel worker in Dearborn, Michigan, weighing her opposition to abortion with her opposition to the war who was rooting for Mr Kerry with reservations, they do not fit easily into either camp. </p> <p>But when the nation goes to the polls today they will only have two camps to choose from and what little common ground there may have been between them has effectively been torched. </p> <p>Watching the third presidential debate with about 40 students in Iowa City, the Republicans sat on one side and the Democrats on the other. At moments the Republicans would break into cheers or laughter at a phrase or facial expression of one of the two candidates, to the bewilderment of the Democrats. A few minutes later the Democrats would do the same, leaving the Republicans similarly confused. </p> <p>They were not just watching the candidates on a split screen. They were viewing the entire event as though from a split screen, each side hermetically sealed from the other as though they were witnessing two completely different events in a parallel universe. </p> <p>On these rare occasions when people are presented with the same raw data, the two camps have managed to fashion conclusions that are not just different but almost entirely contradictory. So rather than partisan arguments adjusting to take account of reality, reality is altered to suit the argument. </p> <p>So it has been throughout the trip, with both sides rejecting negative polling results as rigged and denouncing the media for being biased in favour of the other side, leaving few basic facts that anyone can agree on. </p> <p>A recent poll, released by the Programme on International Policy Attitudes, showed that the overwhelming majority of Bush supporters still believe that Iraq had ties to al-Qaida or the September 11 terrorist attacks and had weapons of mass destruction or a programme to develop them. They also believe that the world favours a Bush victory. In each case only a minority of Democrats shared those views. </p> <p>It follows that from this different understanding of the problems come entirely polarised conclusions about the solutions. </p> <p>Rick Sapareto in New Hampshire supports Mr Bush and the war in Iraq. \"I'm very concerned that my boys may end up fighting a war in 15 years because we failed to take action,\" he said. </p> <p>Lisa O'Neill, who lives just a few minutes away, supports Mr Kerry and opposes the war for almost entirely the same reason. \"I have an 11- and 13-year-old who could be drafted if this carries on,\" she said. When I called them both the day after the first debate each one thought their side had won. </p> <p>The Democrats that I have met seem much more aware than Republicans that the world will be watching nervously today. Indeed Republicans seem quite bullish in their indifference. But while the rest of the world has been watching the US these past few months, the US has not been particularly interested in the rest of the world. </p> <p>In his classic book, Democracy in America, the 19th century French intellectual Alexis de Tocqueville wrote: \"All the domestic controversies of the Americans at first appear to a stranger to be incomprehensible or puerile, and he is at a loss whether to pity a people who take such arrant trifles in good earnest or to envy that happiness which enables a community to discuss them.\" </p> <p>This is an election about America and its obsessions, old and new, and many of them are indeed incomprehensible. Guns, gays, God, abortion, stem cells, jobs, health care, social security and the shortage of the flu vaccine have all been raised at one time or another. </p> <p>\"You'd think with everything else going on in the world they'd have something better to worry about than gays getting married,\" said Ann Fuhrman, a lesbian living in Springfield, Missouri. </p> <p>But the United Nations, global warming have not come up once; the Middle East is a big issue for Arab-Americans and Jews everywhere, but nobody else has mentioned it. </p> <p><b>Invasion</b><br> </p> <p>So, when they discuss Iraq and the war on terror they do so in terms of the human and financial costs to America. If the occupation were going well you do not get the impression that the invasion of a sovereign country and the lack of weapons of mass destruction would be a major issue. </p> <p>\"I know we're making an attempt to help the Iraqi people,\" said Yvonne Shostack, in Derry. \"But I thought things would be more resolved than they are. People are still getting killed and we're still out there.\" </p> <p>But what is most bizarre about this polarisation is that all the emotional energy appears to be concentrated around one pole. </p> <p>Over the past five weeks I have not met one person who had a passionate word to say about Mr Kerry one way or the other. Though I don't doubt that some exist, the Democrats I have encountered are primarily motivated by their hatred of Mr Bush. \"If they put up a vacuum cleaner against Bush we'd vote for it and just ask them to change the bag every now and then,\" quipped Gene Lyons, a columnist for the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. </p> <p>Republicans are adversely galvanised by their love of Bush. \"He stepped up to the plate and showed the world what we can do,\" said Chris Paxos, at a job centre in Canton, Ohio. </p> <p>This is not an election about platforms or ideas. It has brought the issue of who owns America and what its values should be into stark relief. But it cannot answer them. </p> <p>Today will be a referendum on one man - George Bush - and his record. Whoever wins will do so by a narrow margin and inherit a deeply divided nation. But, legal challenges notwithstanding, that will be tomorrow's story. And nobody is looking that far ahead.</p>",
  "For the party volunteers responsible for making sure their partisans make it to the polls before closing time, this is the toughest day of the campaign. At the International Union of Operating Engineers, about 150 Democrats in winter coats and solid shoes are preparing for a hard day of grassroots organising. They have 8,000 potential voters - people who need rides to the polls, people who need a little gentle persuasion - to contact by phone or in person. <p>A young woman at the front of the hall waves a sheet of paper at a group of volunteers: \"Can anyone go drag this person to the polls?\" she yells. </p> <p>People with Kerry/Edwards stickers plastered over their sweatshirts are downing coffee and bagels and donuts, one shift just in from waving placards on street corners, another preparing to walk the streets with voter lists and make sure every registered Democrat in House District no. 2 casts their vote for Kerry and Democratic senate hopeful Ken Salazar. </p> <p>Les Berry explains that he needs to increase voter participation in this heavily Democratic area due to the traditionally low turnout. </p> <p>\"We registered about 2,000 new people in this district, and we need to get them to the polls,\" he says. His volunteers have been out since 7am trying to shore up support for Kerry and Salazar. </p> <p>Mike Stratton, the chairman of Salazar's senate campaign, makes a brief visit to rally the troops. \"You are at ground zero of this campaign. These voters will show up today if you drag them out of their houses,\" he says. </p> <p>Republicans get their voters out early, so the day will get harder for the Democrats between 2pm and the polls closing 7pm, he says.</p> <p>\"Our people are working people, and most will not vote until they get home from work today,\" he warns. \"In House District 2 we have a lot of Hispanics, and they are motivated to put Ken Salazar in the senate. Colorado could be the deciding state for Kerry, and it will definitely be the deciding state for the US senate.\"</p> <p>Gary Dreiling and Will Miles are in the very front line of this campaign. They grab their 'walk lists' from a precinct captain and head out together to knock on doors in a neighbourhood dominated by pawn shops, auto repair stores and taquerias. Most of their target voters are receptive, though, and all say they're voting Kerry. </p> <p>Despite his opposition to abortion, Dreiling supports Kerry and Salazar because he wants to see an economic change. After he was laid off from his last job, Dreiling has struggled to make child support payments for his seven-year-old son. </p> <p>\"It's all about the money with Bush. There's people like me who get laid off and can't find a job. There's no room for the small guy in the Republican party, and that's who I am,\" he says. </p> <p>Miles, a psychologist, has always voted Democrat, and his biggest concern this time is the make up of the supreme court. \"If you know anything about the civil rights movement, you'll know we always made our gains under Democrats and not Republicans,\" he says.</p> <p>Miles is also angry over Iraq, which he sees as an unnecessary war. \"Minorities fight the wars disproportionately,\" he adds. </p> <p>Across town, Clare Morey has spent the early part of this morning in the crunchy leftover snow outside a polling station at St Barnabas church in the Denver's middle class Congress Park neighbourhood. She is making sure voters who registered with Move On show up to vote, and she has stacks of Krispy Kreme donuts on hand to bribe potential voters into the polls. </p> <p>This is the first year she has done anything like this, but she's impressed by the turnout today.</p> <p>Inside the church hall, Ted Oyler and Ruth Baker have neared the front of the line after a wait of only 15 minutes or so. This is the third time Oyler has attempted to vote, with waits of up to two hours trumping his plans to take advantage of early voting. Still, St Barnabas is a busy place today, and Baker says she has never seen it so packed for an election. </p> <p>Oyler, though, is convinced that he will not be waking up tomorrow to a clear winner in this election. \"I think whichever party loses will challenge the result,\" he says. He also believes there has been a good deal of voter fraud in Denver. \"Someone tried to register at my home address,\" he says. \"I called the election office and they said this was happening a lot.\"</p> <p>Baker remains optimistic that the election will end cleanly on November 3, but admits she received a phone call asking if someone else lived at her address, as someone was trying to fraudulently register themselves to her home. </p> <p>Volunteers, both Republican and Democrat, have a long day ahead of them before they can retire to what both optimistically refer to as 'victory parties', at separate Marriott hotels across town from each other in Denver. But by 7pm mountain time, there will be nothing any of them can do except wait, drink and hope.</p>",

  "The Downing Street switchboard staff will be hoping for a clear winner in the US presidential election today, so they will know who to place the prime minister's congratulation call with tomorrow. Four years ago No 10 had to wait until Al Gore finally conceded defeat, amid the chaos that surrounded Florida's contested election, before Tony Blair could speak to George Bush. <p>\"Getting on with the US president whatever his party\" is at the top of Mr Blair's own job specification, according to his former press secretary, Alastair Campbell. Downing Street went to great lengths to establishment a close relationship with the Bush administration in early 2001. Mr Blair's chief of staff, Jonathan Powell, and foreign affairs advisor, John Sawers, were dispatched to meet the new president's team. </p> <p>So as not to alienate the eventual winner - as John Major did when he sanctioned a trail through Bill Clinton's security service records in 1992 - the government has gone to great pains to stay out of the presidential race. Mr Blair has resisted every effort to get him to state a preference, while Peter Hain was the only cabinet minister to drop in on John Kerry's campaign when he visited the States in the summer.</p> <p>Links with the Democrats have, however, been built up by John Casson, political first secretary at the British embassy in Washington. He has been following the Kerry and Bush campaigns as they have criss-crossed America. It is the job done by Mr Powell in 1992, before he was poached from the diplomatic corps by Mr Blair when he became Labour leader.</p> <p>Mr Casson's reports have contributed to the Foreign Office's assessment of what a Kerry administration, or a second Bush term, will mean for the \"special relationship\". This will inform the \"PS-to-PS\" letter that the Foreign Office's permanent under secretary, Sir Michael Jay, will send to the cabinet secretary, Sir Andrew Turnbull, tomorrow morning ahead of Mr Blair's call to the winner.</p> <p>Inevitably a Kerry victory will spark the most activity in Whitehall, as the government scrabbles to work out exactly where his administration will stand on Iraq and the other key issues. The task will be made easier, though, by the fact that many of the leading candidates for Beltway jobs, such as James Rubin and Richard Holbrooke, have already served under Mr Clinton, and are therefore known to ministers and civil servants. The government will also have until the January inauguration to get things straight. </p> <p>Though Senator Kerry's criticism of the war in Iraq has embarrassed Mr Blair - leading to reports that the prime minister is secretly hoping for a Bush win - Downing Street is enthusiastic about a Democratic victory. No 10 advisers think that he shares the prime minister's \"muscular multilateral\" approach to foreign affairs. They also believe that a change in Washington will allow progress on such deadlocked issues as the Middle East peace process and climate change.</p> <p>The Tory opposition will, meanwhile, take heart from the defeat of another pro-war world leader if Mr Bush follows Spain's Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar into the political wilderness. A Kerry victory would inevitably identify Mr Blair as the likeliest next political casualty of the war. No 10, however, hopes that Bush's departure would help drain some of the poison from the Iraq debate.</p>",
  "As the blogger <a href=\"http://denbeste.nu/cd_log_entries/2004/07/Hystericallyshriekingleft.shtml\">Steven Den Beste</a> wrote: \"I was tired of the November 2004 election in November 2003.\" Me, too. By this time tomorrow, God willing and the creeks don't rise (as we say in these parts), we'll know who won. <p>I hope it is Bush, of course, and the final round of polling makes that look likely. But polls are always doubtful, and I have trusted them even less than usual this cycle. But more, even, than I hope for a Bush win, I hope that whoever wins gets a clear victory. Otherwise - especially as no one has chosen to take <a href=\"http://www.techcentralstation.com/110502A.html\">my advice on dealing with voter fraud</a> - we may be in for a rerun of the 2000 election, with all the partisanship and rancour that it involved. </p> <p>That was bad back then, when we were all still drowsing in the afterglow as the dot-com bubble deflated, and when the only people who realised we were at war with terrorists who wanted to bring down the west were the terrorists themselves. It would be worse now, when - after elections in Afghanistan and a notable lack of success by the terrorists in Iraq - the war is going well enough that even Osama bin Laden is <a href=\"http://belmontclub.blogspot.com/2004/10/osama-bin-ladens-surrender-proposal.html\">trying to sound reasonable</a>. </p> <p>Division in wartime is bad, and those people who feel the war hurts their domestic political interests would like us to forget that we are, in fact, at war - and winning. Still, the division in America has been quite noticeable and, contrary to the received wisdom, it existed both before, and immediately after, September 11 2001. As the blogger Larry Ribstein <a href=\"http://busmovie.typepad.com/ideoblog/2004/10/a_reflection_on.html\">notes</a>:</p> <p>\"As the lefties age, folks who used to pride themselves on tolerance now turn to virulent and destructive hatred. They justify their attitude by speaking of the intolerance of those they hate - of gays, of the poor, of African-Americans, etc. They also claim to be disturbed by Bush's inflexibility and insularity. But hatred distorts their vision. They ignore, for example, the irony that these supposed lovers of all the world's people should scorn Bush's idealism, denigrate the Iraqis' impulse for freedom and despair about the economic rise of third world countries at the expense of our own jobs. And in any event such hatred cannot be justified by the supposed errors of its target ...\"</p> <p>Bush-hatred antedated Iraq. Consider the following excerpts from an email Michael Moore broadcast on September 12 2001. It is worth reading now, a couple of days before the election (and a couple of days after OBL has officially taken credit for 9/11):</p> <p>\"Many families have been devastated tonight. This just is not right. They did not deserve to die. If someone did this to get back at Bush, then they did so by killing thousands of people who DID NOT VOTE for him! Boston, New York, DC, and the planes' destination of California - these were places that voted AGAINST Bush! Why kill them? Why kill anyone? Such insanity ... Let's mourn, let's grieve, and when it's appropriate let's examine our contribution to the unsafe world we live in.\"</p> <p>As Ribstein continues: \"Reflect on what this initial reaction to 9/11 says about the attitudes of Moore, and of those in his wide and enthusiastic audience. A day after 9/11, Moore's impulse was to blame Bush and his policies. As the identity and nature of our attackers became apparent, Moore and his friends had to devise more elaborate explanations of how Bush was at fault.\" </p> <p>Indeed. Since then, Moore has likened the terrorists in Iraq to the minutemen of the American revolution and spun elaborate conspiracy theories. The Lord Haw-Haw of this war, he has become rich and famous attacking his own countrymen.</p> <p>But Moore is a symptom, not the disease. America, and the west in general, has somehow bred a class of elites who think that their own countries, and societies, are presumptively wrong. Hit from outside, their first instincts are to look inward - to conspiracies, or to some sort of flaw that might justify the attacks. Say what you will of the old-time elites, but at least they did not suffer from this vice. </p> <p>It has been hard for Bush to run a war in the face of this sort of attitude. I think that it will be impossible for Kerry to do so, since it is endemic among many of his strongest supporters. Will the American electorate agree with me? We will know tomorrow.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Glenn Reynolds, a law professor at the University of Tennessee, runs the <a href=\"http://www.instapundit.com\">instapundit</a> US political blog.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Comment on this article <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/news/archives/us_elections/2004/11/for_a_decisive_victory.html\">here</a>.</p>",
  "<p>For months leading up to today's election, George Bush and his campaign team have been criss-crossing the US in a fleet of red, white and blue buses bearing the words \"A Safer World - A More Hopeful America\", followed close behind by several coachloads of journalists. Amid the mayhem that attends the motorcade, few people seem to have noticed anything odd about the occasional appearance of another, unauthorised bus, bedecked with near-identical patriotic graphics and a huge photograph of the president's grinning face. </p> <p>The somewhat defensive slogan \"I'm telling the truth!\" should probably have rung alarm bells. So should the fact that the zealous campaigners on board claimed to represent a pressure group called Yes Bush Can. Mainly, though, alarm bells did not ring - which is why, over recent weeks, numerous loyal Republicans have happily signed a pledge in which, among other things, they agreed to host a permanent nuclear waste storage facility in their neighbourhood, promised not to have sex before marriage, and specified which branch of the military they would prefer their children to join to fight America's forthcoming war against North Korea. </p> <p>\"That's what's amazing about the discourse in this country,\" says Mike Bonnano, one of the two weapons-grade ironists behind Yes Bush Can. \"People are so used to complete absurdity that nothing surprises them any more.\" </p> <p>Bonnano and his accomplice, Andy Bichlbaum, are used to people not getting their jokes. Fury and incomprehension were the main reactions to one of Bonnano's most celebrated youthful stunts when, in the 1990s, he and some friends bought crateloads of Barbie Dolls and GI Joe toys, swapped the voiceboxes, and smuggled them back onto the shelves in time for Christmas. Children and parents across America were confronted with testosterone-drenched killing-machine Barbies, and soldiers who just wanted to go shopping. </p> <p>But for failure to bat an eyelid in the presence of satire, the Oscar must go to the delegates at a textiles convention in Finland, featured midway through Bonnano and Bichlbaum's forthcoming documentary, The Yes Men. The film recounts what happened when the pair set up a fake World Trade Organisation website, then began to receive - and accept - speaking invitations from unsuspecting conference organisers. Jonathan Swift, meet Ali G. </p> <p>The textiles experts don't blink when Bichlbaum, posing as a WTO economist named Hank Hardy Unruh, delivers a thoughtful lecture on slavery, explaining that the real problem with forced labour is the unfortunate burden of having to house and feed your unpaid workers: paying exploitative wages to workers in the developing world, he notes, is really far more cost-effective. </p> <p>\"We call it identity correction,\" says Bonnano, sipping coffee with Bichlbaum on a rickety bench outside a cafe in Manhattan's East Village. Bush, and the WTO, \"are doing all these things and then presenting them through this weird distorting lens - this bizarre convex lens that makes them reversed, so that the Clean Air Initiative is really about making the air dirtier, and the Healthy Forests Initiative is about cutting down the trees. We're just providing the reverse lens so that it comes out clear again at the other side. But a lot of people aren't ready to accept that clarity yet.\" </p> <p>Both men used to teach media theory, and it shows: they have a ready scholarly answer to the question of why people tolerate their absurdity. \"Often, I think they just respect the authority of the World Trade Organisation,\" Bonnano says, citing the 1950s experiments of the psychologist Stanley Milgram, who found that members of the public would deliver what they thought were fatal levels of electric shock to strangers if commanded to do so by a figure of authority. The Milgram experiment \"actually involved them doing something. This just involves them listening without reacting negatively. It's a straightforward psychological phenomenon.\" </p> <p>If there is something a little disturbing about Bichlbaum and Bonnano's activities - which are now a full-time job, funded by a handful of particularly indulgent charitable foundations - it has to do with the vulnerability of some of their victims. The Yes Bush Can team, for example, recently solicited signatures in favour of tax cuts for the wealthy outside 99-cent stores, whose low-income clientele hardly seem like the ripest targets for mockery. They have an answer for that too, though: they're not just sending people up, they insist, but seeking to politicise them. \"We want them to figure out what's happening - that's the best thing!\" Bonnano says. </p> <p>The documentary is at its most satisfying, therefore, when a class of university students are provoked into open rebellion against Bonnano, posing as a representative from McDonald's. He begins his lecture by handing out free Big Macs, then strolls to his overhead projector and begins to outline his firm's latest act of corporate responsibility: converting first-world human waste into fast food for developing countries. The students begin to study their burgers sceptically. Then they start throwing them. </p> <p>Oddly, neither Bonnano nor Bichlbaum ever burst into laughter mid-performance. \"It's weird,\" says Bichlbaum. \"It just doesn't occur to you to crack up.\" And in any case, the response of an audience when realisation dawns is not necessarily amusing, as the two discovered recently when they attended a conference in Florida on how to protect children from internet pornography. (They were posing, needless to say, as representatives of the Bush campaign, having been contacted through their website CheneyBush.com.) </p> <p>\"It was organised by this strange, cultish group, the International Web Police - they're all about making people afraid about what lurks behind every corner of the internet,\" Bonnano recalls. \"So we worked up this lecture that involved a baby doll and a bucket of water labelled 'Porno', and we demonstrated how a normal baby, without any protection, could simply be dipped in the bucket and submerged in pornography.\" </p> <p>But the Bush campaign, the men told the largely conservative crowd, had a plan: the Patriot Act. \"The Patriot Act was a plastic bag,\" Bonnano explains. \"So we put the baby in the plastic bag and sucked the air out with a vacuum cleaner, and the baby collapsed into a shrivelled nothing, and we say: 'Look, the Patriot Act is working!'\" The audience looked on appreciatively. </p> <p>\"Then at the end, Andy's unpacking the baby, and he shouts: 'Now, if John Kerry gets his way, the baby's going right back in the bucket of pornography !' And he throws the baby from across the room, into the bucket. And somebody at the back finally says, 'What's going on here?' And then it was like all hell broke loose. We ended up being run out of the room. They were screaming at us about the horror of what we had done.\" </p> <p>Bonnano shakes his head, presumably at the memory of the conferencegoers' violent response, although quite possibly also at the concept of a lifestyle that involves travelling to Florida in order to throw a doll into a bucket of water in the first place. Such are the duties incumbent upon a liberal satirist in the era of George Bush. \"Of course,\" he adds, \"if Kerry wins, we'll immediately turn it all against him.\" </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Yes Men is released in the UK in January <a href=\"http://www.theyesmen.org\">www.theyesmen.org</a></p>",

  "<p>ITV's new digital channel ITV3 hit the ground running yesterday when its launch show, a previously unseen edition of John Hannah detective drama Rebus, attracted nearly 500,000 viewers. </p> <p>ITV3 was also the second most watched multichannel service between its launch at 9pm last night and 2am, beaten only by Living TV.</p> <p>The new Rebus, in which Hannah stars as the eponymous Scottish detective created by crime writer Ian Rankin, was watched by 492,000 viewers on ITV3 between 9pm and 11pm, according to unofficial overnights.</p> <p>Rebus was the second most watched non-terrestrial show during that period, behind Living TV's Most Haunted Live at Halloween, which attracted 704,000 viewers.</p> <p>The ITV3 launch show proved more popular than Sky One's Ewan McGregor motorbiking documentary, Long Way Round, which was watched by 275,000 viewers, and Toughest Villages in Britain, which attracted 340,000 from 10pm.</p> <p>Over on E4 from 9pm, The OC attracted 179,000 viewers, while from 10pm The Simple Life 2 was watched by 66,000.</p> <p>BBC3 documentary The Porn King vs the President was watched by 91,000 viewers in the same slot and ITV2 movie repeat Coming to America attracted 375,000.</p> <p>Later in the evening, ITV3's US crime import Hack attracted 193,000 viewers from 11pm and 48,000 stayed with a repeat of 60s movie In the Heat of the Night between midnight and 2am.</p> <p>Overall, ITV3 attracted a 3.5% share of multichannel viewing between 9pm and 2am, placing it second only to Living TV among non-terrestrial services.</p> <p>An ITV documentary about the trials of being a teenage parent had nearly 7 million viewers, beating the rather more glamorous fictional world of BBC1's Spooks.</p> <p>Britain's Youngest Mums and Dads featured some of the 100,000 teenagers who become pregnant in the UK every year, including 17-year-old Anita, who was just 12 when she gave birth to son Cameron.</p> <p>One previewer described the documentary as \"relentlessly grim\", but it didn't stop an average of 6.6 million viewers tuning in, nearly three in 10 of the audience, with a peak of 7.7 million.</p> <p>It was an impressive performance for a peak time documentary, and gave ITV a 9pm ratings victory over BBC1's Spooks, which averaged 6 million.</p> <p>Five also enjoyed documentary success at 9pm with the provocatively titled The Boy with a Tumour for a Face. The story of a five-year-old Indonesian boy with the largest facial tumour ever recorded, it had 2.5 million viewers, or one in 10 of the audience - the same as a Dead Ringers US election special at the same time on BBC2.</p> <p>Squeezed by a strong performance on the four other channels, the latest instalment of Channel 4's flagship history series - Monarchy, by David Starkey - trailed in fifth place with 1.8 million viewers, a 7% share.</p> <p>The second episode of BBC2's animated satirical series Monkey Dust had 1.2 million at 10pm. It lost out to Channel 4's Jerry Bruckheimer import Without a Trace, which had 1.9 million.</p> <p>BBC2's comedy night fared rather better with Michael Gambon's appearance on Room 101. The actor, whose pet hates included birthdays and the residents of Notting Hill, pulled 2.2 million viewers at 9.30pm.</p> <p>Earlier on Channel 4, Peter Oborne's The Dirty Race for the White House, about the flaws in the American electoral system, had 800,000 viewers, a 3% share of the audience. </p> <p>Little Mo's return to Albert Square for the first day of Graham's trial helped EastEnders to 11.3 million viewers at 7.30pm. It predictably had the beating of ITV1's Tonight with Trevor McDonald, which had 4.2 million, but the biggest audience of the night went to Coronation Street. A double whammy of the ITV soap had 12.5 million and 11 million respectively.</p> <p>The last in the latest series of They Think It's All Over, in its new 10.35pm slot, had 3.8 million viewers, just over a quarter of the audience and 1.2 million more than were watching the ITV News, which had 2.6 million.</p> <p>In the teatime sofa wars, ITV's Paul O'Grady Show celebrated its biggest audience yet with 2.2 million viewers, a 15% slice of the audience. It was 400,000 viewers ahead of Channel 4's Richard and Judy, with 1.8 million.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",

  "<p><strong>Pre-amble:</strong></p> <p>It's simple: Chelsea need a point to progress into the last 16. They should get it too, seeing as CSKA's defending at set-pieces is dodgier than a Mafiosi-run Moscow hotel. Jose Mourinho makes four changes, including a first European start of the season for Scott Parker, with Arjen Robben and Damien Duff let loose down the wings together for the first time.</p> <p><strong>ITV pre-match exchange:</strong></p> <p>ITV interviewer, Ned Bolton: \"So, Sir Bobby, what brings you to Moscow?\"<br> Bobby Robson [looking bemused]: \"Er, the match of course.\"<br></p> <p>And Sir Bobby's thoughts on Jose Mourinho? \"For an inexperienced coach he's a very experienced lad.\"<br></p> <p>You couldn't make it up, could you?</p> <p><strong>1 min:</strong> We're off! Meanwhile your emails are flying in. \"Wagner Love sounds like a German website fusing porn and The Ring Cycle,\" says Kate Carter. \"A truly horrible thought.\"</p> <p><strong>2 min:</strong> Chelsea are already pinging it around nicely - two passes become 10, then 20, and soon we're reaching Leeds-in-the-70s proportions. Incidentally, the temperatures have just dipped below freezing in Moscow and the long-sleeves are everywhere.</p> <p><strong>5 min:</strong> First attack of the night from CSKA. Zhirkov sends Johnson this way and that, but the Chelsea defender - while falling haplessly - does at least manage to get a tackle in. Three successive corners follow, until Chelsea finally clear.</p> <p><strong>8 min:</strong> CSKA win yet another corner, and Boris Yeltsin, looking on, nods in approval (although that could be the vodka.) The Russians can't take advantage, however: Rahimic's header goes harmlessly wide.</p> <p><strong>10 min:</strong> \"Is John Terry sticking with the short sleeves?\" asks Chris Baker. \"I understand he was sporting shorts and flip flops for a visit to Red Square.\" Yes to both points, Chris.</p> <p><strong>13 min:</strong> What a block from John Terry! Berezutsky hits a full-blooded blaster that catches the Chelsea defender full in the face - yet he barely blinks. CSKA are having the better of this at the moment.</p> <p><strong>15 min:</strong> \"Porn and the ring cycle? Maybe you had better inform Ms Carter that this has already been done on more than one occasion (Backdoor Babes Nos.1-2997873),\" reckons Matt Muir.</p> <p><strong>18 min:</strong> It's been a lively start, though still no real chances of note. The atmosphere is red-hot, however, with more whistles and klaxons than a Notting Hill carnival/Gay Pride crossover. CSKA win yet another corner (their fifth), but once again they waste it.</p> <p><strong>20 min:</strong> Glenn Johnson, who's come under steady pressure from Zhirkov, gives the ball away in midfield and suddenly CSKA steam forward. Just when it's looking dangerous, Makelele cynically chops down Vagner Love - but the referee doesn't dish a yellow card.</p> <p><strong>22 min:</strong> Now Parker, who's been quieter than Michelle McManus post-Christmas 2003, passes to a CSKA player. The Russians look like they could be in - until Carvalho makes an inch-perfect tackle.</p> <p><strong>24 min: CSKA 0 - 1 Chelsea </strong> A rare Chelsea attack - and a brilliant Arjen Robben goal! Robben feeds Duff, who backheels back into the Dutchman's path. He swivels his hips, diddling a CSKA defender before coolly slotting home. Genius.</p> <p><strong>26 min:</strong> Gone is the cacophony of klaxons and the ear-shrilling whistles: all you can hear now are the 500 Chelsea fans.</p> <p><strong>29 min:</strong> Plus ca change: CSKA waste yet another corner. \"There was a very serious academic tome on my music undergraduate reading list with the title: Penetrating Wagner's Ring,\" says Alex Fleetwood. \"How we sniggered.\" Students, eh?</p> <p><strong>32 min:</strong> CSKA again rack up the corners - we've just seen numbers eight and nine come to nothing - without ever looking like testing Cech. And Chelsea nearly nick another one on the break - Gudjohnsen rounds Akinfeev only for Berezutsky to block on the line.</p> <p><strong>35 min:</strong> Let's pause for a moment of propaganda. \"I hope all your American readers will be putting a cross next to George W. Bush's name,\" says Chad Davies. \"The future of the free world depends on it.\" You sure, Chad?</p> <p><strong>37 min:</strong> Meanwhile back at Locomotiv Stadium, it's very much as you were: CSKA dominating possession, but Chelsea's defence looking safer than a hip-hop-loving chav.</p> <p><strong>40 min:</strong> Brilliant save from Cech! Vagner Love turns past Parker, then twists around Carvalho before unleashing a vicious shot from 20 yards. Somehow the Czech keeper gets a fingertip to it - while Love seems to have tweaked his hamstring.</p> <p><strong>42 min:</strong> Love's back on, seemingly fit again. Meanwhile Grace Pickering is unhappy. \"I hope the Americans will be voting for Bush too, given that there's a free bar at Otto's Shrunken Head in NYC if Bush does win,\" she says. \"Maybe the hangover will blot out the pain for the next four years.\"</p> <p><strong>44 min:</strong> A break in play as Gusev gets treated for injury. CSKA win a corner, but once again ... actually, do you need me to tell you the rest?</p> <p><strong>Half-time:</strong></p> <p><strong>Half-time comments/rants/etc:</strong></p> <p>\"If Bush wins this one, I won't be the only American looking for a new home. Anyone interested in sponsoring my application for citizenship in UK/Ireland/Canada? Please? Pretty please?\" - Billy Lalor.</p> <p>\"I went to a wedding where they played 'Air on a G string' by Bach in the church. Almost got thrown out for laughing,\" Duncan Carmicheal.</p> <p>\"Remember Henry from Vancouver from the previous Chelsea v CSKA Moscow commentary? Could you post this for me? Hey Henry! I'm curious to know if you had a successful exchange with your 'striking partner' a fortnight ago. Give us the scoop if you're reading this!\" - John in Vancouver.</p> <p><strong>46 min:</strong> We're off again! And once again the emails are flooding in. \"I've been poll-watching in Minnesota since 6.00 trying to stop his people disenfranchising minority voters. I'm taking a break to warm up and I'll be back doing it later. Kerry in a landslide,\" says Magnus Blair.</p> <p><strong>47 min:</strong> Penalty to CSKA! Johnson, who's struggled all night, takes down Zhirkov for a stonewall spot kick. Love steps forward...</p> <p><strong>48 min:</strong> ...and blasts it high over the bar. It's entering orbit as we speak. What a terrible, terrible penalty.</p> <p><strong>49 min</strong> CSKA are still coming forward, without any success. First another corner comes to nothing, before Cech makes a superb smothering save at the feet of Love.</p> <p><strong>51 min:</strong> I forgot to mention earlier that CKSA made a sub at half-time, Aldonin coming on for Krsasnic. They're still just playing one up front though. \"I love Bush and I am in Canada!\" says Brooks Davis. \"Tell Billy Lalor in the States that I'm willing to swap countries with him if Bush wins again.\" Some people, eh?</p> <p><strong>53 min:</strong> It's all CSKA at the moment: Chelsea aren't harrying and hassling with the intensity they had earlier, and the Russians look like they could get something from this.</p> <p><strong>56 min:</strong> Chelsea sub: the injured Gallas off, Ferreira on. \"If Bush wins, I'll be applying to the Irish Embassy in Chicago for a passport for my two children so that they can have dual citizenship,\" says Sean V. \"The man has a love for battles and war and he may introduce the draft. I don't trust him for a minute.\"</p> <p><strong>58 min:</strong> CSKA win another corner. Incredibly, it actually reaches a Russian head, but Jarosik's header slides wide.</p> <p><strong>61 min:</strong> CSKA are subjecting the Chelsea goal to wave after wave of attack now: Cech's just saved well from Jarosik, while Johnson's picked up a yellow for fouling Zhirkov. If the Russians get an equaliser, I know who my money would be on...</p> <p><strong>64 min:</strong> Chelsea make another sub - with Tiago coming on for Parker. But Mourinho should really be replacing Johnson: he's just fouled Zhirkov again, and could easily get a red card here.</p> <p><strong>66 min:</strong> Another CSKA corner - I think that's their 14th or 15th - comes to nothing as Jarosik's weak header drops wide.</p> <p><strong>68 min:</strong> Another CKSA corner, etc and so on... \"Was No29 in line at 6:10am in New Jersey on my way to the train,\" says David Goodrich. \"Turnout will be heavy in the USA.\" First time for everything, eh?</p> <p><strong>70 min:</strong> Another Chelsea sub: Kezman on for Gudjohnsen. Meanwhile Olic replaces Semak, much to the CSKA fans' disapproval.</p> <p><strong>73 min:</strong> Still CSKA come forward: probing, pressing - and yet still not looking like they're going to score. Meanwhile Kezman picks up a yellow for a late challenge on Akinfeev.</p> <p><strong>75 min:</strong> Brilliant play from Robben, who jinks this way and that, taking on three players before being cynically chopped down by Rahimic. But Chelsea do nothing with the free-kick and CSKA clear.</p> <p><strong>78 min:</strong> It's all a bit patchy at the moment: the spate of substitutions seems to have knocked CSKA out of their rhythm. Meanwhile Edward Wilford is unhappy. \"Hasn't the Guardian taken enough guff of late for dipping its toe into American politics, especially where it concerns that feckless mouth-breathing Troglodite and his evil, evil cronies?\" he says. \"(Note: the person writing this carries an American passport...)\". Fair point, Ed.</p> <p><strong>80 min:</strong> Yellow card: Olic, for wrapping his legs around Makelele.</p> <p><strong>83 min:</strong> Tiago tries his luck from distance - but he shanks his shot like a once-a-year golfer on the first tee. Chelsea look comfortable now, though.</p> <p><strong>86 min:</strong> When Terry heads upwards and out, Jarosik suddenly gets a rush of blood to the head: he swivels his hips to allow the ball to drop over his shoulder before attempting an overhead kick ... which flies narrowly wide. Good effort, mind.</p> <p><strong>89 min:</strong> So nearly two-nil for Chelsea. Duff slips inside his marker and feeds Lampard, whose low shot is well saved at the near post. \"Looks like Chelsea are going to win, but it's close and we might have to have a recount,\" suggests Mel Bird. \"Perhaps we'll know the result in six weeks?\"</p> <p><strong>FULL-TIME:</strong> That's it: Chelsea are through to the last 16. It wasn't the prettiest of performances, but once again their rock-solid defence held firm. Mourinho will also be encouraged by the performances of Duff and Robben - on this evidence he's got every chance of winning the trophy for a second year in a row.</p> <p><strong>Teams:</strong></p> <p><strong>CSKA Moscow:</strong> 35-Igor Akinfeev; 2-Deividas Semberas, 4-Sergei Ignashevich, 6-Alexei Berezutsky; 5-Sergei Semak, 8-Rolan Gusev, 17-Milos Krasic, 18-Yuri Zhirkov, 20-Jiri Jarosik, 25-Elver Rahimic; 11-Vagner Love. <strong>Subs:</strong> Mandrykin, Olic, Ferreyra, Kirichenko, Laizans, Aldonin, Shershun.</p> <p>Chelsea: 1-Petr Cech; 2-Glen Johnson, 6-Ricardo Carvalho, 13-William Gallas, 26-John Terry; 4-Claude Makelele, 19-Scott Parker, 8-Frank Lampard, 11-Damien Duff; 16-Arjen Robben, 22-Eidur Gudjohnsen. <strong>Subs:</strong> Cudicini, Babayaro, Kezman, Cole, Paulo Ferreira, Huth, Tiago.</p> <p><strong>Referee:</strong> Massimo de Santis (Italy).</p>",

  "<p>More than 900 people attended a memorial service last Friday for former Superman actor and stem cell research activist <strong>Christopher Reeve</strong>, who died three weeks ago. Guests included Teresa Heinz Kerry, wife of Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry; actors Michael J Fox, Laura Linney, Mary Tyler Moore, Kim Cattrall and Susan Sarandon; and TV chat show host Larry King. \"His courage and inspiration will live on,\" former US first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton said of Reeve, who died of heart failure after his nine-year struggle with paralysis from a riding accident.</p> <p><strong>Saw</strong>'s Halloween bonanza, which saw the creepy horror take its US earnings to over $50m (\u00a327m), has got its producers rubbing their hands with glee - and planning a sequel.

What sounds like a textbook case of voter fraud is in fact a completely legal result of the early voting procedures introduced in many states, though laws about counting dead voters vary across the country. </p> <p>In Florida, government analysts estimated that, based on mortality rates and early voting figures, at least 20 people would have died since casting a vote. The number is likely to be relatively high in Florida, with its sizeable population of elderly people, and will probably be magnified by the popularity of early voting among senior citizens. With the election so finely balanced, deceased early voters could yet swing the election, without the arduous duty of having to stick around for the legal disputes.<br>Oliver Burkeman in Miami </p> <p><b> Parties for US expatriates</b><br> </p> <p>Expatriate Americans in Britain can watch tonight's results at a number of parties.

  "<i>All times GMT. Follow Guardian Unlimited for news reports and analysis through the night</i> <p>One of the many quirks of the presidential election is that a candidate who spends tens or hundreds of millions to persuade the voters relies on the say-so of the television stations to know if he has won.</p> <p>Until 2000 this worked well. A combination of exit polls and early counting meant networks could call the states and proclaim a president by bedtime. But then Florida was called for Al Gore. Then for George Bush. Then no one knew the result until December.</p> <p>Will it happen again? There may be more hesitation this time around, and a greater emphasis on being right than being first - but the statistical models and polling methods have been overhauled, and you should not be too surprised if states are being called for either candidate relatively soon after the polls close.</p> <p>If they are, this is how to read the results.</p> <p><b>Midnight</b></p> <p>It is 7pm in the US eastern time zone and polls are closed in <b>Georgia</b>, <b>Kentucky</b>, <b>Indiana</b>, <b>South Carolina</b>, <b>Virginia</b> and <b>Vermont</b>.</p> <p>This is an easy start. The first five are Bush states and Vermont is for Kerry. If either of these go the other way (Georgia was going 52%-42% for Bush in the most recent poll) it will be a major upset for the other side and the television pundits will start talking in terms of landslides. This is extremely unlikely.</p> <p>Turnout figures should now be emerging. The conventional wisdom is that a high turnout favours the Democrats, but Republican efforts to mobilise their supporters mean this cannot be taken for granted.</p> <p><b>12.30am</b></p> <p>Polls close in <b>Ohio</b> and <b>West Virginia</b> - now we are in the interesting part. The Democrats did some last-minute campaigning in West Virginia - a shaky Republican state - and a Kerry victory, even a strong showing, bodes well for his nationwide result. A clear Bush win would suggest he is holding his ground against the challenger.</p> <p>Ohio may take a while to come through. The polls are on a knife-edge and both sides have fought hard: Kerry visited it close to 30 times in the campaign and Bush almost 20. No Republican has won the White House without it, and if Kerry loses he needs to go on to take Florida and Pennsylvania to be in with a decent chance.</p> <p><b>1am</b></p> <p>Polls close in <b>Alabama</b>, <b>Tennessee</b>, <b>Kansas</b>, <b>Mississippi</b>, <b>Missouri</b> and <b>Oklahoma</b> and should go to Bush. <b>Connecticut</b>, <b>Delaware</b>, the <b>District of Columbia</b>, <b>Illinois</b>, <b>Maine</b>, <b>Maryland</b>, <b>Massachusetts</b> and <b>New Jersey</b> are expected to vote Kerry. If any of these votes the other way, it looks bad for the losing side. The most likely is for New Jersey to switch to Bush. If it does, Kerry is having a bad night.</p> <p>Three more swing states could now be called, though it may take a while for results to filter out. Kerry can expect to win <b>New Hampshire</b> and, according to the final polls, be feeling confident about <b>Pennsylvania</b>. A lot now depends on Ohio, which closed half an hour ago. If Bush has won it, and then wins <b>Florida</b> another term in the White House is looking likely. If Kerry loses Ohio, the Sunshine State starts to look like a necessity. If he wins all three he can start planning his first trip on Air Force One.</p> <p><b>1.30am</b></p> <p>Both <b>Arkansas</b> and <b>North Carolina</b>, where the polls are now closing are Bush states. Neither are likely to swap but a strong Kerry vote on the back of Bill Clinton's campaigning in Arkansas over the last week would point to a strong showing nationwide. If Bush loses it, he is having a bad night.</p> <p><b>2am</b></p> <p>You could now be getting an idea of who the winner is. Of the polls closing now <b>Louisiana</b>, <b>Nebraska</b>, <b>South Dakota</b>, <b>Texas</b> and <b>Wyoming</b> will go to Bush and <b>Rhode Island</b> and <b>New York</b> to Kerry.</p> <p>If the Ohio-Florida-Pennsylvania axis has not yet been called - or all you can see on the television are lawyers - the swing states of <b>Colorado</b>, <b>New Mexico</b> and <b>Wisconsin</b> will start to look crucial.</p> <p><b>Michigan</b> and <b>Minnesota</b> are historically solid Democrat states but could be vulnerable to Bush. The worst case scenario for Kerry would be if Michigan (which only carries three less electoral college votes than mighty Ohio) fell to the incumbent. He can win without it, but it starts to look like a less credible challenge. The same is true for Bush in <b>Arizona</b>. If he loses in the south-west he is starting to look weak on his home turf.</p> <p><b>3am</b></p> <p><b>Monatana</b> and <b>Utah</b> are Bush states. <b>Iowa</b> and <b>Nevada</b> are two swingers edging towards Bush. If Ohio has still not been called and Kerry wins Iowa (plus Michigan and Wisconsin) it points to a Democrat sweep of the Midwest that points to the White House. </p> <p><b>4am</b></p> <p>One candidate should really look in the lead now. <b>California</b>, <b>Oregon</b> and <b>Washington</b> should go to Kerry and <b>Idaho</b> and <b>North Dakota</b>. A toss-up state is normally Democrat <b>Hawaii</b>. Polls put it in the balance and in a very close election its three votes could be decisive.</p> <p><b>5am-6am</b></p> <p><b>Alaska</b>, the last state to close its polls, will go to Bush. If Bush has a lead but Kerry is three votes short, do not sit up expecting the result to hinge on Alaska. Go to bed.</p>",
  "Welcome to the Wrap, Guardian Unlimited's round-up of the best of the day's papers. <p><b>SLEEPLESS IN MILWAUKEE (NOT TO MENTION BRITAIN)</b></p> <p>The tension is growing almost unbearable. When George Bush and John Kerry held neighbouring rallies in Milwaukee yesterday, says Simon Jenkins, it was like \"Hector and Achilles finally meeting under the gates of Troy\". You'll recall that Achilles killed Hector before being killed by Paris's arrow. Make of that what you will.</p> <p>On election day, the broadsheets have turned to what unites Americans rather than what divides them. The Guardian's Gary Younge, who has driven from Mr Kerry's home town, Boston, to Mr Bush's, Midland in Texas, says the two towns \"could be in two entirely different nations\". Yet \"one of the few things that has remained constant while on the road has been the ubiquity of the stars and stripes. The national flag billows everywhere. ... But these demonstrations of patriotism offer little or no suggestion of which side of the political divide people are on. You are as likely to find them among Republicans as Democrats.\" </p> <p>\"The notorious political polarisation in the United States is something of an illusion,\" writes the Telegraph's Niall Ferguson in San Francisco. \"What we are seeing here is a sign of democratic vitality in a land that remains fundamentally whole.\"</p> <p>The pollster John Zogby confirmed the intensity of feeling. \"Among young voters between the ages of 18 and 29,\" he tells the Guardian, \"zero said they were undecided. That suggests a very high level of interest among people who historically were not that engaged - young African-American males, for example.\"</p> <p>The candidates are exhausted. But the Herald Tribune says Mr Kerry \"lightened up\" as the day of judgment approached. \"There is a calm confidence about him in these closing days.\" Mr Bush's \"playful optimism\" betrays no sign of tension, though he is \"greyer\" than he was on September 11 and is \"showing some wear and tear\".</p> <p>The FT lines up David Frum (\"[Bush] fights\") against Douglas Brinkley (\"Do not expect Mr Kerry to capitulate or roll over like Al Gore did\"); the Independent pitches Kerry campaigner George Soros against Matthew Hoffmann (\"Bin Laden has made it clear that his candidate for US president is John Kerry\").</p> <p>Also in the pro-Bush camp is Michael Gove of the Times - \"There's no denying that Hamlet is the more interesting guy. But there's a reason Fortinbras commands the stage at the end of the play ... It's one word. Will.\" Ranged against him are, unsurprisingly, the Independent, Thomas L Friedman of the Herald Tribune (who compares Bush father to son and finds the latter wanting) and the Daily Mail. The latter paper doesn't go quite so far as to endorse Mr Kerry. But America, it says, \"must now decide if it is time to see what difference a new leader can make.\"</p> <p>Finally, the Times asks the question many Wrap readers in the western hemisphere will be considering tonight: \"How soon can we go to bed?\" With the Ohio exit polls likely to come through at 12.30am, Florida's at 1pm, Wisconsin's at 2am and Hawaii's at 5am, the best advice is not to count on sleeping at all.</p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uselections2004/story/0,13918,1341276,00.html\">Let the people decide</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uselections2004/story/0,13918,1341331,00.html\">Gary Younge</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,11069-1340740,00.html\">Times: Michael Gove</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3-1340632,00.html\">Times: Simon Jenkins</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,11069-1340788,00.html\">Times: Insomniacs' guide to a long night</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2004/11/01/opinion/edfried.html\">IHT: Thomas L Friedman</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2004/11/01/news/kerry.html\">IHT: Kerry lightens up</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/2004/11/01/news/bush.html\">IHT: Bush stays positive</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml;sessionid=T0VLAOAHIZSVPQFIQMFSM5WAVCBQ0JVC?xml=/opinion/2004/11/02/do0201.xml&amp;sSheet=/portal/2004/11/02/ixportal.html\">Telegraph: Niall Ferguson</a></p> <p> <b>'SKIRMISHES' IN FALLUJA AHEAD OF ASSAULT</b></p> <p>Meanwhile, what of Iraq?

  "It's actually happening. <p>It was barely two years ago that a band of obsessive political bloggers set their sights on the nascent presidential campaign, positioning themselves for a front-row seat to the big show. It's hard to believe that the end is near.</p> <p>Bush's approval ratings were in the <a href=\"http://www.pollkatz.homestead.com/files/pollkatzmainGRAPHICS_8911_image001.gif\">70% range</a> when many of us wrote our first words of dissent. Bush seemed invincible, riding his Afghanistan victory and a terror-induced, panic-stricken nation to stratospheric approval ratings. Bush had all the political capital he needed to drive his political agenda and sail smoothly to a second term. Except his agenda consisted of a single item: Iraq. </p> <p>Veterans like myself saw Bush's rush to war as an inevitable mistake, wilfully ignoring the lessons of our past - lessons that Bush's father himself heeded when he refused to march on Baghdad in 1991. Bush's fate was now intertwined with that of Iraq: if his war was a success, nothing would stop him in 2004. If he failed, well ...</p> <p>Bush's post-war bounce lasted no more than two months as the war's costs, in both blood and treasure, started taking a toll on his approval ratings. Meanwhile, the Iraq disaster gave rise to a new face in national Democratic party circles: Howard Dean.</p> <p>While originally planning a healthcare-based campaign, the Democratic party's feeble response to Bush's war lust gave Dean an issue that resonated with the party faithful, and a new movement - fuelled by the blogs - was born. </p> <p>Dean ultimately faltered in the Iowa cornfields, but not before the good doctor had fused a new backbone into the Democratic party. Opposing the president - once viewed as political suicide - was suddenly en vogue. The strategy of \"Republican lite\", wielded by Democrats to disastrous consequences in the 2002 midterm election, was finally dead.</p> <p>The odds were still long. Bush had amassed a $180m war chest during the primary. No Democrat could be expected to keep pace with that kind of money, it seemed. Gore <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/2000elect/index/AllCands.htm\">had raised</a> just $50m in 2000 (before federal funds kicked in).</p> <p>But Republicans underestimated the fundraising machine pioneered by the Dean campaign. Donors also flooded the Kerry campaign with unprecedented amounts of money, forcing Bush to far surpass his original $180m goal. Bush still <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/presidential/index.asp?sort=R\">outraised Kerry</a> $360m to $317m including federal funds, but the Republicans wouldn't be able to blow Kerry out with cash alone. Not that they didn't try ...</p> <p>The Bush campaign had little to run on. The economy was bleeding jobs while Iraq had become a political liability. So Republicans placed the spotlight on Kerry instead, hoping to \"define\" him to the electorate before Kerry could fight back. Tens of millions of dollars in attack ads claimed Kerry was a \"flip flopper\", while the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uselections2004/markosmoulitsas/story/0,15139,1314558,00.html\">Rightwing Noise Machine</a> pushed the unrelenting attacks. </p> <p>A Washington Post report in May spoke of the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A3222-2004May30.html\">unprecedented negativity</a> of the Bush effort: \"Scholars and political strategists say the ferocious Bush assault on Kerry this spring has been extraordinary, both for the volume of attacks and for the liberties the president and his campaign have taken with the facts. Though stretching the truth is hardly new in a political campaign, they say the volume of negative charges is unprecedented - both in speeches and in advertising. </p> <p>\"Three-quarters of the ads aired by Bush's campaign have been attacks on Kerry. Bush so far has aired 49,050 negative ads in the top 100 markets, or 75% of his advertising. Kerry has run 13,336 negative ads - or 27% of his total.\"</p> <p>The lowest blow came from the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, who spread unsupported charges that Kerry had faked his medals to any media outlet who would listen - and just about all of them gave these attack dogs a forum. The nerve of these Bush-affiliated surrogates was breathtaking: they slandered Kerry for his well-documented Vietnam heroics, even though not one of them had served with Kerry. Meanwhile, Bush used his family connections to avoid Vietnam, and even then <a href=\"http://www.truthout.org/docs_04/102804L.shtml\">failed to complete</a> his national guard duties. There was no hypocrisy big enough, no slander slimy enough, to keep the Swift Boat liars and their gleeful allies from attempting to take down a genuine American hero.</p> <p>In 2000, the right might have gotten away with it. But the blogs, new progressive thinktanks, Comedy Central's The Daily Show, media watchdog groups and allied organisations helped Kerry beat back the Swift Boat liars and put a spotlight on a clueless-to-hostile mainstream media obsessed with trumpeting Bush's electoral advantages. One small but telling <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/story/2004/10/21/144623/93\"> example</a>: on October 21, an AP poll gave Kerry a 49-46 lead. The headline: \"AP Poll: Bush, Kerry in Dead Heat.\" The same day, a Reuters poll gave Bush a 46-45 lead. The headline? \"Reuters Poll: Bush Grabs One-Point Lead on Kerry.\" </p> <p>The mainstream press didn't want to believe that the \"wartime president\", he of the unprecedented approval ratings, could actually be vulnerable.</p> <p>Kerry faced $200m in negative attack ads, a hostile mainstream media, an administration that uses \"terror\" as a political tool and the combined might of the Rightwing Noise Machine. Yet Kerry entered election day in a strong position to win, both in the final round of polls and in early voting results in battlegrounds like Iowa and Florida.

Analysts said signs of stronger exports from Iraq, plentiful stocks in the US and the prospect of a slowdown in China had contributed to the continuation of last week's 10% drop in oil prices. </p> <p>Dearer energy has been a factor in slowing the US economy in recent months, with yesterday's snapshot of manufacturing the latest data to show a weakening of growth prospects. </p> <p>Brent crude fell $1.92 to $47.06 a barrel, while American light crude dropped below the $50 level. </p> <p>Although industry in Britain bucked its recent negative trend, the snapshot of manufacturers in America showed expansion easing for the third month in a row at the slowest rate since September 2003. </p> <p>The US index of national manufacturing activity fell to 56.8 from 58.5 in September. A measure above 50 shows the sector is still expanding and one below shows it in contraction. </p> <p>Elizabeth Denison, an economist at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein, said: \"It's down for the third straight month after being at relatively high levels right through July, which is an indication that growth is moderating ... The report is another indication that we may be losing strength in the recovery.\" </p> <p>In Britain the outlook was cheerier as a similar snapshot of the UK's industrial sector showed healthy growth, in sharp contrast to recent gloomy economic data. </p> <p>In spite of this, economists maintained their view that the Bank of England's monetary policy committee will not raise rates at their meeting this week. The latest survey by Reuters showed only one economist out of 45 polled expects the MPC to raise rates. </p> <p>The Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply said manufacturing grew at its fastest rate for three months at 53 for this month and beat City expectations of 52. The CIPS said it had revised its forecast for September up to 52.3. </p> <p>Paul Dales of Capital Economics said: \"This survey will encourage the monetary policy committee that the large fall in manufacturing output in the third quarter, which dragged overall GDP growth down to just 0.4%, may prove only temporary. Even so it will not be enough to prompt an interest rate hike on Thursday.\" </p> <p>Although the survey showed that manufacturers are beginning to raise their prices, commodity costs are increasing more quickly. </p> <p>\"The bad news for manufacturers is that input price inflation is close to decade highs and, although output price inflation has also picked up, it continues to trail well behind the rise in costs, so manufacturers' margins remain under pressure,\" said Ross Walker of the Royal Bank of Scotland. </p> <p>A separate survey showed a disappointing downturn in manufacturing in the eurozone. The region registered a large increase in input prices and a large fall in new orders, which economists said was \"worrying\". </p> <p>The eurozone purchasing managers' index for this month was 52.4, below forecasts of 53 and down from 53.1 in September. The headline indices for Germany, France and Italy - the three largest economies - all fell.</p>",
  "Americans will vote today in what many believe is the most important election of their lives - a bitter contest over national identity that has broken political records. <p>The two candidates ended their campaigns with every opinion poll showing the race as tight as it has ever been. </p> <p>In 10 polls of likely voters over the past three days, President George Bush led in five, John Kerry led in three, and the candidates were tied in two. The gap in every case was within the margin of error. Ralph Nader, the independent third party candidate, mostly scored between zero and 2%. </p> <p>The sheer intensity of the duel between Mr Bush and Mr Kerry was reflected in the fury of the last day's campaigning. The Democratic challenger made two stops in Ohio, two in Wisconsin and one in Michigan, while the president criss-crossed the nation making seven stops in six battleground states, from Pennsylvania to New Mexico. </p> <p>The frenetic pace brought the two campaigns to within a few blocks of each other in Milwaukee, holding noon rallies on a dismal Wisconsin day. </p> <p>With everything staked on the rival party machines galvanising their supporters, the sheer pressure of the race led both candidates to consider abandoning the traditional day of rest on election day. </p> <p>The president, who had been due to spend much of today at his Texas ranch before flying to Washington tonight, was reported to be considering a surprise dash to swing states, possibly Florida and Ohio. Mr Kerry was planning a visit to La Crosse, Wisconsin. </p> <p>Such a move would not be the only way that this election, contested against a backdrop of war abroad and deep cultural conflict at home, has broken the political mould. </p> <p>It is by far the most expensive vote in history, costing well over $1bn (\u00a3544m). Television advertising has cost an estimated $550m, with $60m in television spots broadcast in the last week alone to an already jaded audience in about a dozen swing states. </p> <p>The intense emotions stirred up by the battle have also reversed a long trend towards lower voter interest in politics. </p> <p>\"By virtue of the level of voter interest, it's clear people are voting as if their lives depended on it,\" John Zogby, the head of the polling company Zogby International, said. </p> <p>The intensity of feeling was particularly pronounced among young voters. </p> <p>Mr Zogby said that, according to his own polling, \"among young voters between the ages of 18 and 29, zero said they were undecided. That suggests a very high level of interest among people who historically are not that engaged - young African-American males, for example\". </p> <p>He expected the youth vote to account for 12% of the electorate, but two thirds of any youth turnout above that would be to Mr Kerry's benefit. </p> <p>The prospect of the highest turnout for at least a decade, and possibly much longer, could also benefit the challenger. </p> <p>\"A higher voter turnout ... is historically bad news for the incumbent,\" Mr Zogby said. \"My hunch tells me that we're looking at a Kerry victory.\" </p> <p>However, Karl Rove, the president's political adviser, predicted a comfortable win for Bush. </p> <p>\"We will win Florida and Ohio,\" he said backstage at a Bush rally. \"We'll take two or three or four states that were won by Gore in the last election.\" </p> <p>Among the quarter of the electorate who have taken the opportunity to vote early, the candidates were reported to be neck and neck. Last night, a line of more than 500 people snaked across a Miami forecourt, the last enthusiasts waiting to cast their vote early. </p> <p>Some had waited for up to five hours, gratefully taking bottles of water handed out by supporters of both candidates. </p> <p>\"Ain't no way Bush is stealing it this time,\" said 18-year-old Tia Martin. </p> <p>Ultimate victory will depend on party activists and their capacity to deliver their supporters to the polls today. Mr Rove claimed that the Bush campaign would today have 1.4 million volunteers making calls and ferrying people to the polls. </p> <p>\"It's more than doubled since 2000,\" he said. \"One lesson we learned last time is that we had to have centralised direction so that we made sure we had the volunteers where we needed them.\" </p> <p>The Democratic force is more decentralised, with the work being divided among unions, liberal interest groups and local party volunteers, but the party also reported doubling the foot soldiers it had at its disposal four years ago. </p> <p>Both sides are also ready for the possibility that the election will be so close that it may be resolved once more in the courts. </p> <p>Both have thousands of lawyers on standby to fly to the scene of a recount dispute. </p> <p>For the Democrats, there was one positive omen. </p> <p>It is part of US political lore that whenever the Washington Redskins football team lose their last Sunday game before the election, the incumbent will be defeated. It has held true since 1936, and on Sunday the Redskins lost.</p>",
  "John Kerry's quest for the White House, a journey he began 45 years ago as an earnest teenage debate champion, entered its longest day yesterday, with the Democrat racing through six rallies in four states in a last appeal to America. <p>By yesterday afternoon, on a miserable day in Milwaukee, a lifetime of striving was distilled into an instant of clarity. \"This is kind of a magical moment,\" Mr Kerry told an outdoor rally in the centre of town. \"The hopes of the whole nation, and the whole world are on the line.\"</p> <p>The fatigue was evident on Mr Kerry's face and in his voice. He has slept at a different location for each of the last 19 nights and his schedule yesterday, as on many days, stretched to 17 hours. But as he hugged his daughters Alexandra and Vanessa, he looked happy and genuinely touched as a sodden crowd in fluorescent campaign rain ponchos chanted: \"One more day.\"</p> <p>With the clock running down towards today's vote, Mr Kerry's was a day of perpetual motion: from Florida, today's biggest battleground prize, to Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio, another large state within the Democrats' reach, and back to Wisconsin.</p> <p>Democratic aides say that Mr Kerry has maintained an inner calm during the last hours of the campaign, occasionally tossing around a football on airport tarmacs, or doing stretching exercises in his seat. By the time he got to Milwaukee, he seemed almost nostalgic about the gruelling itineraries of recent days. \"You guys look so wonderful, wet and bundled and huddled up,\" he told the crowd, promising to remember Milwaukee no matter what happened.</p> <p>Although the latest opinion polls gave the Democrats no cause for confidence - demonstrating yet again that today's contest is a virtual tie - Mr Kerry, they say, betrays little sign of tension. But they also admit that he has taken to switching off the television when new poll numbers pop up.</p> <p>However, they say that this is a man who is focused on the completion of a mission that has consumed his entire life. Mr Kerry's presidential ambitions took root with his teenage infatuation with the late John F Kennedy, and was never extinguished even after losing his first election for Congress in the 1970s, and a disastrous early start in the Democratic primaries.</p> <p>A year ago, he was forced to mortgage his home in Boston to continue what then seemed a doomed campaign for the Democratic leadership. By last night, he had burned through an election season that was the most gruelling and expensive in history. But he seemed, at last, resigned to his fate - as did his supporters. \"All I can do is go out and vote. The rest is out of my control,\" said David Ollinger, a bass player and hunting enthusiast.</p> <p>While Mr Kerry's strategy has focused on wresting Florida and Ohio from Mr Bush, he has also had to protect his own turf, warding off Republican designs on Michigan and Wisconsin. He has his work cut out for him in Wisconsin, a fact he acknowledged by returning to the state to spend the night there last night. Al Gore eked out a bare bones victory in the 2000 elections, taking it by just 5,700 votes, and Mr Kerry is struggling against increasing conservatism in rural parts of the state.</p> <p>His supporters were there for him in Milwaukee yesterday. \"We earnestly want to see George Bush displaced. He has just been so bad,\" said Jeri Waldman, who dragged her family out in the rain. Now, Mr Kerry needs them to be out for him again today.</p>",
  "The independent candidate, Ralph Nader, limped into the home stretch of his presidential campaign yesterday, with barely 1% of voters behind him. <p>Despite a huge collapse in support compared to 2000 and little organisation on the ground, Mr Nader's meagre showing could still prove a decisive factor in a tight race. </p> <p>\"The reality is the Nader factor is arguably still there,\" Chris Kofinis, senior adviser to the anti-Nader group TheNaderFactor.com told the Associated Press. \"But we've been incredibly successful at minimising it in part because of Nader's own failings and in part because people don't buy his message anymore.\" </p> <p>Democrats accuse Mr Nader, an anti-corporate crusader, of handing the election to George Bush in 2000 by siphoning votes that would have gone to Al Gore. Mr Nader, who gained 2.7% of the vote nationwide, won more than the margin between Mr Gore and Mr Bush in New Hampshire and Florida. </p> <p>Exit polls from 2000 show that two thirds of those who voted for Mr Nader would not have voted otherwise and Mr Nader replies that he took more votes from Republicans in New Hampshire and Mr Gore was defeated because he could not win his own state, Tennessee. </p> <p>But many prominent left wingers who backed Mr Nader in 2000, including Noam Chomsky and Michael Moore, have abandoned him this year, arguing that his candidacy will be counterproductive. </p> <p>Democrats have successfully sought to keep Mr Nader off the ballot around the country by challenging the signatures he has submitted. Mr Nader has condemned \"dirty tricks, harassment and intimidation\" by Democrats. </p> <p>\"If you're not willing to lose in politics, and fight and lose again, and fight and lose again, your agenda will never prevail,\" he said last week. </p> <p>He will still be running in many battleground states, including Florida, Minnesota, Iowa and New Hampshire where the race between Mr Bush and Mr Kerry is effectively tied. </p> <p>But in many of the areas where he performed best last time, such as Minnesota and Colorado where he attracted 5% of the vote, his support has effectively collapsed, bumping along between 1% and the asterisk of an also ran. </p> <p>Polls vary on whom Mr Nader hurts most. A recent Gallup poll suggested 52% of those backing him would otherwise vote Republican, as opposed to 48% who would go to the Democrats. Others have shown his voters favouring Mr Kerry to Mr Bush by three to one.</p>",

  "The election is so near, and the polls so close, that it's now a mug's game to predict the outcome with anything approaching confidence, let alone certainty. <p>A few months ago, I was certain President George Bush would be re-elected, after he easily won the battle to frame the central question of the campaign around security and leadership. It was like taking the first three rounds in a 15-round bout. And while I understand why Senator John Kerry had to establish his war leadership credentials, I felt that he should have used his own Democrat convention to get a sharper focus on the economy, where the administration has nothing like the success story that our Labour government can tell. That was like giving away two rounds. </p> <p>Little by little, however, the Kerry campaign has improved. While his attacks on Bush's Iraq policy were high-risk, they energised his campaign and the election as a whole. He started to rebut the Bush attacks with greater skill after the woefully slow response to the attacks on his Vietnam record (how the Republicans turned the Democratic challenger's genuine war heroism into a Kerry weakness at a key stage of the campaign is one of its more compelling issues). Above all, perhaps, he did well in the TV debates, probably winning all three on points, which gave him momentum and confidence. </p> <p>Yet say \"confidence\" and I swing back to Bush. As a campaigner, to use a well-known Bushism, he has always been \"misunderestimated\" - particularly in Europe, where people judge him according to our own politics, not the politics of mainstream America. </p> <p>Both sides have worked hard to register more people to vote. Higher turnout should benefit the Democrats. Historically, a bigger share of those last-minute undecideds tends to go to the challenger. Another round for Kerry maybe. As for the Osama bin Laden video, it plays both ways, but on balance probably helped Bush. </p> <p>But if it is too close to call, there is another question arousing debate in Britain: who would Tony Blair want to win? I saw a television discussion involving two pundits recently. Both were said to know the prime minister's mind. One said with certainty he would prefer Bush; the other said Kerry. The truth is neither knows. </p> <p>Is it really four years since the pundits said Blair was praying for a Gore win because he would not get on with a rightwing Bush administration, while American pundits were saying Bush would not get on with someone so close to Clinton? Now the charge is that Bush and Blair are too close. </p> <p>They built that relationship in part because Blair so studiously stayed out of the Bush-Gore race. But he was surely right to stay neutral then, as he is right to stay neutral now, despite Labour's natural closeness to the Democrats. If Blair drew up his own job spec, \"getting on with the US president whatever their party\" would be high up the list of requirements. He worked at his relationship with Clinton, and with Bush. It will be the same if Kerry wins. </p> <p>There is no doubt the Bush relationship has given him enormous political difficulties. But Blair believes they are worth bearing for the benefits a strong relationship brings to Britain, economically and diplomatically. The political hit has been taken on this, and won't necessarily get worse if Bush wins again. </p> <p>If Kerry wins, we will hear lots of media blather about how this isolates Blair on Iraq. But one of the first foreign policy meetings a new president would want would be with Blair, to go over plans, not just on democratising Iraq, but the Middle East peace process, the threat posed by nuclear proliferation, global terrorism and relations between Europe and America. Blair's statecraft so far tells you such a meeting would go well, that both men would make sure they got along and reached decisions that took account of each other's political realities. </p> <p>In many ways it feels like only yesterday that I was part of the Downing Street team, meticulously planning Bill Clinton's visit in May 1997. A lot has happened since then - including the fact that Blair is now one of the most experienced and respected leaders on the world stage. He will be as interested as anyone to know the outcome as soon as it is clear. But of this I am certain: he will have worked out a plan for both outcomes, and the minute the result comes through, he will begin to put the relevant plan into action. </p> <p>There are not many areas in politics where sitting on the fence is the right approach. But a US presidential election, for a British prime minister, is one of them. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Alastair Campbell was Tony Blair's press secretary from 1997 to 2003 </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Almost four decades ago, during the Vietnam war, the great liberal, Senator J William Fulbright, captured more eloquently than any recent commentary what is a stake in today's US presidential election. There were, he said, two Americas: \"One is generous and humane, the other narrowly egotistical; one is self-critical, the other self-righteous; one is sensible, the other romantic; one is good humoured, the other solemn; one is inquiring, the other pontificating; one is moderate, the other filled with passionate intensity; one is judicious and the other arrogant in the use of great power.\" <p>Which of these two Americas prevails today is a question of huge significance for us all. It can be seen in the intensity of interest across the globe and in the large numbers of Americans who say this is the most important election of their lifetime. The outcome will determine whether America reaches out to the world in a spirit of partnership or continues with its posture of sullen rejectionism. It will determine whether this misdirected war on terror continues to escalate into a clash of civilisations that puts us all in greater danger, or can be turned into an effective campaign to address the political causes of terrorism. </p> <p>It will also determine the course of American politics for a generation. With up to four supreme court judges likely to be replaced in the next four years, the occupant of the White House will be in a unique position to influence the direction of American constitutional law. A Bush victory would enable him to entrench his harsh, moralistic conservatism in ways that would be impossible to reverse for many years. A Kerry presidency would have less room for manoeuvre, but might at least stop the rot that has seen American liberalism in almost continuous retreat since the 1960s. This is a battle for America's political soul. </p> <p>For most of the democratic world, there are good reasons for wanting a Kerry victory. His promise to create a much broader international coalition against terrorism carries with it an implicit acceptance that the views of countries other than America must once again be made to count for something. To lead, he will have to generate consent. Even so, it is important not to exaggerate the extent to which a change of president would lead to a change in American foreign policy. </p> <p>In order to mount a credible challenge to Bush, Kerry has felt the need to pander to Republican prejudices across a wide range of issues. Don't, for example, hold your breath for ratification of the Kyoto treaty or a tough line against Israel's land grab in the West Bank. The limits of the possible will be determined by, among other things, a Congress that looks set to remain firmly in Republican hands. Whoever occupies the White House, conservatism will remain America's governing ideology for the foreseeable future. </p> <p>The reasons for this need to be analysed and understood if there is to be any hope of bringing America back into the community of responsible nations on anything more than an occasional basis. This is about much more than one administration and the policies it pursues. It is fundamentally a question of global power relations and the distorting impact of American primacy. As Fulbright argued: \"Power tends to confuse itself with virtue and a great nation is particularly susceptible to the idea that its power is a sign of God's favour.\" Along with the preponderance of American power comes an unshakeable faith in the superiority of American ideas and an irresistible urge to act on them. The folly is to imagine that it could be otherwise. </p> <p>For Britain, this poses some uncomfortable choices. We could continue to pursue our \"special relationship\" in the hope that America behaves with enough self-restraint to avoid compromising other relationships that matter to us, most notably in Europe. This would certainly be easier with Kerry in the White House, but it would do nothing to address structural causes of America's lurch to the right. By putting fidelity to the \"special relationship\" first, we can only weaken Europe's collective voice and encourage America's unilateralist impulse, further souring transatlantic relations and leaving us exposed - the choice we have always attempted to avoid. </p> <p>The truth is that if we want a durable transatlantic partnership that works in the common interests of Europe and America, it will only become possible if Britain is prepared to abandon the illusion of \"specialness\" in its relations with America and give priority to the objective of forging a common European approach. This is not primarily a matter of treaties and institutions; it is much more a question of mindset. One of the most remarkable features of the Iraq war was the extent to which several European governments were willing to ignore the opposition of their own voters in order to support Bush. Like the native administrators of some colonised land, there is the tendency in parts of Europe, and Britain in particular, for the political classes to identify more with the \"colonial power\" than with the people they are supposed to represent. </p> <p>Tony Blair represents such an extreme example of this condition that it is difficult to imagine how a Europe that includes him among its leaders can ever hope to restore to the transatlantic relationship a necessary measure of balance. </p> <p>Yet what is the alternative? Michael Howard's adoption of a more critical position on the war and the Bush-Blair relationship is utterly unconvincing, and the Liberal Democrats, though sincere, are not yet ready for government. The only other potential prime minister, Gordon Brown, is still mired in third-way ambiguity, positioning Britain as equidistant from Washington and Brussels. Few doubt that he, like Blair, would have followed Bush into Iraq; yet even so, there is one important difference between them that at least raises the possibility that a change of leader might enable Britain to loosen the suffocating embrace of the \"special relationship\". It comes down to an issue of pride. </p> <p>It is entirely likely that Blair, in moments of private reflection, understands that he made an enormous mistake in selling his support to George Bush so cheaply. But even if this were the case, any public admission that he got it wrong would, at this late stage, destroy the little authority he retains. Consequently, he is obliged to plough ahead without any room for manoeuvre. Brown carries none of this baggage. The only limitations he has are the ones he chooses for himself by failing to signal a change of direction. Were he to do so, it would send a powerful signal to sections of the Labour party that remain far from convinced that a leadership challenge would be worth the trouble. </p> <p>Whether today's vote goes for Bush or Kerry, Britain and Europe need a fresh start in their relations with America. This will only be possible if we are prepared to take tough decisions and weather the inevitable storm of protest from Washington. The prize of a stronger and more balanced partnership between Europe and America is considerable. What it requires is an act of real leadership. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> David Clark is a former Labour government adviser </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:Dkclark@aol.com\">Dkclark@aol.com</a></p>",
  "We are all Americans now, announced that now famous Le Monde headline after September 11 2001. Back then, more than three years ago, it felt true. But we all know the feeling is not as strong now; and we also sense that it is not George Bush alone who has made it so. Indeed, irrespective of how Americans vote over the next 24 hours, today may even be the day when the rest of us should begin to stop being Americans at all. <p>The Bush administration's policy of \"America first\" is neither some personal obsession on Bush's part nor a spasm in response to the shock of September 11. It is part of a much older, wider and very specifically American conservative sense of exceptionalism whose militancy and energy are still greatly underestimated outside America. If Bush is re-elected today, that sense will deepen and strengthen further. But even if Bush loses, this same American exceptionalism is now so strong that it will aggressively constrain any other presidency, even one that seeks to reject the approach, as Bill Clinton's did and John Kerry's would do. </p> <p>The rejection of international institutions and stable alliances is a signature aspect of this militant new exceptionalism. It is inconceivable that it will be significantly reined in during a second Bush term. From the point of view of the administration and the bulk of its Republican supporters, however, this unilateralism is merely one aspect of a distinctive worldview which has little parallel in any other liberal democracy, and which might best be seen as a modern reincarnation of the old American preoccupation with \"manifest destiny\". </p> <p>The concept of manifest destiny first entered American political parlance in the 1840s, when continental expansionism first became physically sustainable. The phrase comes from a journalist, John L O'Sullivan, who proclaimed that it was America's \"manifest destiny to overspread the continent allotted by providence for the free development of our yearly multiplying millions\". It became the ideological justification for the annexation of Texas, followed by California and Oregon; was part of the thinking involved in the purchase of Alaska from Russia; provoked occasional 19th-century dreams about the subjugation of Canada; and resurfaced once more in the seizure of Cuba in 1898. </p> <p>The Lebensraum aspect of manifest destiny is less significant now. But the military power that always went with it is not. Yet the part of O'Sullivan's phrase that resonates most for many core Republicans today is the part that concerns providence's wishes for America. There has been this strand to American ideology ever since the Puritans first described their settlement in the new world as the creation of a city upon a hill, on which the eyes of the world were trained. It has always been part of many American religious cultures, most notably Scots-Irish Protestantism and the too often neglected phenomenon of Mormonism. But it has resurfaced in the past decade at the very heart of American politics. </p> <p>Bush's apparent acceptance of the view that he may be doing God's work in the White House has been much noted in this country as the campaign has wound through the autumn. But this is not some idiosyncratic hubris on the president's part. It is shared by millions of American conservative evangelical protestants, many of whom believe, along with the attorney-general John Ashcroft, that the very existence of the United States is proof of a divine purpose. In that context, the idea that America should reject ties with necessarily less blessed nations becomes existential, an exceptionalism of another order altogether. </p> <p>Most Americans don't think in these terms, of course. Yet sufficiently large numbers of them do for their conviction to be massively important, especially when they are so determined and have such powerful armed forces. If you believe that God has a higher purpose for your work, then you bring a special fervour to everything that you do, whether it is re-electing the president, challenging his opponent's credentials, stopping his voters from voting, challenging their votes or - if by some cruel fate the opponent wins the election - preventing him from governing. Just what they did with Clinton, in fact. </p> <p>The irresistible conclusion to be drawn from watching the Republicans at work for the past 10 years is that, because they want it far more intensely than even the most partisan Democrats ever do, they will always be more ruthless both in victory and in defeat. We are right to think that the Bush first term would be the model for a freshly energised Bush second term. But we also need to realise that Republican behaviour in Clinton's second term would be their model under a Kerry presidency. </p> <p>It is the centrality to American public life of this militant conservatism, more than any other single factor, which makes current British policy towards the United States so difficult to pursue productively or honourably and which has brought this country's relationship with the US to its present ebb. Tony Blair's policy has been entirely consistent - to stick fast to America under all circumstances. It will clearly remain his policy whether Bush wins or Kerry. </p> <p>But it shouldn't. It would be a more defensible policy if American parties were like European parties - but they are not, with the consequence that the policy becomes a hostage to the Republican right when the Republicans are in power and is constrained by them when the Democrats are in the White House. The invasion of Iraq, in this context, is more an example of British marginality than a good or a bad policy in itself. Unless British policy adapts and changes to these realities, it is doomed to be replayed over Iran or Cuba or whatever other adventure becomes the conservative right's next test of God's higher purpose. </p> <p>Breaking out of this vice is therefore the most pressing and serious task facing this country's foreign policy. Yet to do such a thing requires a revolution in thinking and a reorientation of perceived British interests in favour of Europe, which this country and its politicians have long resisted. Blair's belief that Britain can have the best of both worlds and be a bridge between America and Europe is not wholly absurd in itself. But the lesson of the last three years ought to be that it does not work - that it is a bad policy - when there is an administration in Washington that does not take other nations seriously. And since that is the case, and may remain so even if Kerry wins, the policy has to change. </p> <p>To do that, though, requires an effort on all our parts, not just on Blair's. It means, above all, thinking in a more informed way about the foreignness of America. It means a growing up and growing away process that need not and most certainly should not mean becoming anti-American. But unless and until we do it, unless we see that our centre of gravity in the 21st century should be as part of an alliance of liberal European states, we are fated to fall between America and Europe, not to be a bridge between them. It is a challenge to Blair, to whoever succeeds him, and to our very sense of ourselves. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:m.kettle@theguardian.com\">m.kettle@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<b>\u00b7</b> Without further ado, then, we present the Diary's Grand Election Night Drinking Game, an entertainment designed to get you through the magic of democracy in action the best legal way we know. Now, the rules. (And we recommend you avoid playing with beer unless you want to be painfully, terrifyingly conscious throughout the procedure.) Take one gulp for any mention of: chads, stem cells, God, lawyers, the words \"too close to call\", superstitions (everything from sporting wins to the winner always taking Missouri), and whenever you see Dick Cheney. Take two gulps for: every airing of the Kerry \"reporting for duty\" clip, every time Peter Snow says \"just for fun\", any mention of Bin Laden's October surprise, and all disenfranchisement references. Empty your glass: if Wisconsin goes to Bush, if Nader gets more than 1% of any state's votes, if a network brings a previously called state back into play, or if lingering on Fox News for more than four consecutive minutes. Down the bottle: if the idiot wins, obviously. As for when to resort to the stuff under the kitchen sink - well, pretty much if it all comes down to the swing to him in Clark County. <p><b>\u00b7</b> It may be a whole week since the Wall Street Journal published that soul-searching correction to an article which had suggested Fox News was \"sympathetic to the Bush cause\", but network personnel still refuse to provide liberals with ammunition. In a studio discussion of the Bin Laden video on Friday, a guest told Fox anchor Neil Cavuto that Osama's Bush criticisms amounted to an endorsement of Kerry. When another guest objected that it was hardly as if he had a Kerry-Edwards sticker in his cave, Neil stepped in as the moderator. \"He's all but doing that,\" he explained. \"I think I saw a button.\" Special. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Elsewhere, and mindful of the claim that Rupert Murdoch never interferes with his British broadsheets, we are confused by rambling pre-election leaders in both the Times and the Sunday Times which conspicuously fail to make any specific endorsement. Still, we'll put it down to one of those things, and merely marvel at an excerpt from Robert Thomson's Times effort. \"For all the wealth of a country supposedly in thrall to mass materialism,\" it sparkles, \"dialectical materialism is yet to be sold on hypermarket shelves and God still mans the checkout.\" A classic. And a timely reminder that fresh magic mushrooms are not illegal, kids. Only dried. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Surveillance: Capital radio DJ Dr Neil Fox, at 4.15pm on Saturday, waiting for transport outside Peter Jones in London's Sloane Square. Wearing his doctorate lightly as usual, Neil was holding sundry purchases, including a household mop. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> And so once more to Jane Griffiths, the deselected member for Reading West, who has reacted so sensibly to a Diary item detailing her appearance at a recent cocktail party at the town's Renaissance Hotel. Specifically, she has written three letters accusing a constituent of being the source - wrongly, as it goes - and dispatched them to him, the hotel, and the Labour party, of which he is a member. \"What fun,\" she concluded in her email informing us of this course of action. Indeed, and yet, like all the crazier kinds of fun, one tends to pay for it later. The gentleman has now instructed his solicitor to issue libel proceedings against Jane, and is demanding a public retraction at her earliest convenience. And our heroine? Alas, she's not around to talk. Developing, as they say. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Finally, following yesterday's interview in which he explained that the next election should not be \"a referendum on this government\", we feel the time is approaching to devote more space to Alan Milburn. Those with revealing anecdotes or even trivia concerning New Labour's election stategist are invited to get in touch.</p>"
