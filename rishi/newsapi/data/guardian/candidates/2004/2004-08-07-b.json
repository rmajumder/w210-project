  "<p><strong>George Melly, Nuts &amp; Son Of Nuts </strong><br>(Warner) </p> <p>Thirty years of not entirely well-behaved entertaining around the globe started with Nuts , recorded live at Ronnie Scott's in 1972. 'A night to remember for those who can. Some can't', as the notes have it. When the album came out, Melly chucked his job on this paper and hit the road. Everyone should have a George Melly CD in the house, for those moments when life gets a bit too solemn, and this is the one to have. Two, actually, because it's a double. It features the original Feet warmers, with Wally Fawkes (also formerly of this paper) on clarinet and Bruce Turner on alto saxophone, both playing beautifully, as does trumpeter John Chilton. George excels himself, especially in the title song, a masterpiece of single entendre. </p> <p><strong>Weather Report, I Sing The Body Electric</strong><br> (Columbia) </p> <p>Dating from 1972, this was Weather Report's second album, and the one that launched a whole new approach to what came to be known as 'fusion'. With the perspective of foreground and background in constant motion, and melodic lines melting into one another, the effect was indeed rather like speeded-up changes in the weather. The two dominant figures are Joe Zawinul at the keyboards and Wayne Shorter on tenor and soprano saxophones. If this CD sounds typical of its time, that's because its lead was soon followed by others. It retains a freshness that most of the imitators never had in the first place. </p> <p><strong>Ken Peplowski, Easy To Remember</strong><br> (Nagel Heyer) </p> <p>If you want to hear some masterly clarinet playing, listen to Peplowski's long, unaccompanied introduction to 'Everything I Love' on this CD. It will give you the shivers. His albums are always meticulously planned, with just the right mixture of the new and the familiar and little surprises dotted about. There are two here - the Paul McCartney song, 'Junk', prettily sung by Kim Liggett, and Bobby Short singing 'It's Easy To Remember'. But it is Peplowski's clarinet that dominates, even to the extent of overshadowing his own very good tenor saxophone playing.</p>",
  "It is rare for a politician to be so feted in Africa. Young, good-looking and articulate, the rising political star whose name means 'blessed' in Swahili has become a symbol of hope for the continent.Yet he is not an African. Barack Obama, whose father is Kenyan, is in fact running for election in America where he is favourite to become the country's only African-American senator in November. <p>His autobiography, Dreams From My Father, an account of his search for his African roots, is set to soar up the bestseller lists when it is published in the US on Tuesday. </p> <p>In Africa, however, he is already becoming a political superstar. Obama is hero-worshipped in Kenya, partly because of disillusionment with the ruling elite in a country where politics is synonymous with corruption and tribal feuding. </p> <p>His dazzling speech to the Democratic party convention in Boston last month, in which he cited his African roots as proof that America was 'a magical place' for hard-working immigrants, struck a chord here. </p> <p>He may have been thinking of Kenya when he listed among America's 'small miracles' the fact that 'we can have an idea and start our own business without paying a bribe; that we can participate in the political process without fear of retribution'. </p> <p>Obama, 42, who is fighting for election in Illinois, told the convention: 'My father was a foreign student, born and raised in a small village in Kenya. He grew up herding goats, went to school in a tin-roof shack. His father was a cook, a servant to the British.' </p> <p>In the village of Kogelo, in western Kenya, where his father is buried and his paternal grandmother still lives in a two-room house with a chicken coop outside, local people dream that an Obama victory will end their poverty. </p> <p>The dream is not confined to Kogelo. 'People believe he will come to Kenya and build schools, build Aids orphanages,' said Njeri Rugene, chief parliamentary reporter for Kenya's Nation newspaper. </p> <p>'We have had so many letters from people asking our politicians to emulate him - saying he is a sign of hope.' </p> <p>Kenyans were promised a new dawn 18 months ago when the regime of Daniel arap Moi - so notorious for plundering public coffers that the International Monetary Fund suspended aid to the country - was swept from power by a rainbow coalition. </p> <p>Despite delivering a popular pledge to bring in free primary education, the new government of President Mwai Kibaki has lost momentum and become mired in a sleaze scandal over contracts for a passport computer system. </p> <p>Against that backdrop, Obama's style and rhetoric is inspirational. While politics in Kenya is still driven by tribal loyalties, his oratory emphasised embracing fellow Americans across political, religious and class divides. </p> <p>By referring to his immigrant roots, Obama identified himself with 'the larger American story', but his speech struck a chord with Africans who dream of a new life in the US. </p> <p>In his book, Obama writes of a journey to the graves of his father and grandfather in Kenya's Nyanza province, a region of lush sugar cane fields which dip down to the shores of Lake Victoria. </p> <p>Obama's father, also named Barack Obama, went to the US as a student and met Obama's mother, Ann, who had moved from Kansas to Hawaii with her parents. </p> <p>Obama Senior won a scholarship to Harvard, left his family while his son was a toddler and eventually returned to Kenya, where he became a government economist and a prominent figure in the tight-knit ruling elite. </p> <p>Aside from one brief visit, Obama never saw his father again. He died in a car accident in 1982. </p> <p>Obama Senior had a reputation for intellectual brilliance, but a weakness for drink, which his son found out about while tracing family history in Kenya. </p> <p>His father's home province has the highest rate of HIV-Aids infection in Kenya and its capital, Kisumu, a once-thriving lakeside port, has dwindled with the decline of trade across the lake. </p> <p>As elsewhere in Africa, society and politics in western Kenya is dominated by conservative older men. Obama 'is young, and we do not have young leaders who express themselves like he does,' said Dr Wangare Mwai, a cultural researcher at Maseno University in Nyanza. 'They leave it to the older generations. He is an example we would wish everybody to follow.' </p> <p>Africans hope a half-Kenyan senator will encourage US policymakers to pay closer attention to the continent. A powerful domestic motivation underlying US concern over the slaughter in the Darfur region of Sudan has been the desire to appeal to African-American voters in an election year. </p> <p>Black US churchgoers take an interest in Sudan because of the civil war in the south, in which a predominantly Arab and Muslim government has been fighting black Christian or animist rebels. </p> <p>African-American politicians were key in getting Congress to declare the Darfur violence to be genocide. </p> <p>Africans would see Obama's election as a step as big as fellow African Kofi Annan becoming secretary-general of the United Nations. 'It will show America is not racist,' said Wangare Mwai.</p>",
  "<p>The American election is about terrorism, not the economy, right? The evidence so far suggests so: George W Bush and John Kerry have sought to persuade Americans that they are the 'safety-first' choice. Even economists themselves say the economy is not the key issue. </p> <p>'Is the economy an election issue? No,' says Citigroup chief economist Robert DiClemente. 'It could have been. There were people who thought we would never see the job market recover at the beginning of this year. It has.' </p> <p>But could priorities be changing? Last week a Washington Post /ABC News poll showed 25 per cent of voters listed the economy as the most important issue, with 23 per cent saying Iraq and 20 per cent terrorism. </p> <p>Kerry sought to push economic policy up the agenda on Tuesday, unveiling a health and education spending package financed by revoking tax cuts to the super-wealthy that was designed to claim fiscal responsibility for the Democrats. The following day he boasted the endorsement of 200 business leaders. </p> <p>He would have been pleased to see that 52 per cent of those polled thought he was the more trusted than Bush (41 per cent) on the economy: perhaps reflecting a post-convention 'bounce'. </p> <p>Meanwhile Bush's trump is wearing exceedingly thin: 46 per cent believed he was the right person to deal with Iraq, while 48 per cent chose Kerry. But the disapproval rating for his handling of the economy has fallen throughout the summer, only rising after the Democrat convention. Might he see the economy as suitable ground to join battle? </p> <p>Events of the past week are making it difficult to ignore. Oil prices reached a record $44.3 a barrel in New York. The persistent rise in prices this year was blamed for the 0.3 per cent decline in consumer spending in June, the biggest since 2001. Then, last Friday, weaker- than-expected US employment figures were released. The budget deficit, swollen by spending on war in Iraq and security, is of increasing concern with expectations that it will reach nearly half a trillion dollars this year. Tax and spending plans are under the spotlight. </p> <p>There are also worries over inflation: not just because of oil, but also a global recovery that is happening everywhere at the same time. And then there are buoyant property prices, with talk of a crash in the middle of next year. </p> <p>Could this combination reverse what has always been seen as a remarkably pain-free recovery from the 2000 technology bubble? History shows that oil shocks combined with asset bubbles are a dangerous mixture. </p> <p>Some economists believe the US is on a knife edge. For the partisan who have the election in mind there are two questions: in a year's time, will the winner be glad he won; and will the identity of the winner influence the outcome? </p> <p>Ian Morris, US economist for HSBC in New York, says the winner could be facing very difficult times:'The general expectation is that the economy will grow at about 4 per cent over the remainder of this year and into next. But the high oil price, combined with increased saving, caused a soft patch in consumer spending in June, and the outlook suggests there is no reason for that to change. That will make it very difficult for consumption to grow above 2 per cent, and I think there is the potential for a very serious downward revision to growth - maybe to 2 per cent.' </p> <p>He points to lower growth knocking the employment market recovery and exacerbating budget and trade deficits. </p> <p>Corporate earnings are also under pressure, according to HSBC's global equity strategist John Velis, who believes profits, particularly in technology and banking sectors that account for 35 per cent of the Standard &amp; Poors 500, have peaked, and are likely to be weaker in the second half of this year. But Morris and others believe the property market could be the worst problem. </p> <p>Morgan Stanley chief economist Stephen Roach recently warned that the belief that America had transformed itself from being an income to an asset economy, where people's wealth and decisions are driven not by what they earn but by what they own, has resurfaced in the housing market. </p> <p>He dismisses the idea of this 'new paradigm' as more dangerous than the last - the productivity miracle and the dotcom boom - because to join in, millions of Americans have indebted themselves, spurred on by low interest rates. Household sector debt in the US was up to 85 per cent of GDP last year, from 70 per cent in 1995. People don't borrow on that level to buy shares. </p> <p>Morris says: 'The bubble has moved from technology to real estate - that is where to find irrational exuberance now.' </p> <p>He adds that house prices relative to income, rent and replacement cost are at historic highs, and believes that the likely upward trend in Fed rates will trigger a fall, possibly a crash. He argues that, while much of this debt is tied up in long-term, low-rate mortgages, it is homebuyers who determine the housing market, and they will be exposed to rising rates. He warns: 'Consumer hard landings are typical in housing busts because wealth effects from real estate are more powerful than from stocks.' </p> <p>These views are not universally shared. DiClemente of Citigroup says: 'We have already seen a major adjustment of the long-term price of oil, and I think it can be dealt with if the rise occurs gradually. The problem comes if you get a $30 hike in two to three weeks. That is possible, but it would need a massive supply disruption.' </p> <p>Meanwhile, he says, the property bubble 'relates really to six or seven hotspots such as New York City, and does not affect the majority of the US'. </p> <p>His optimism is shared by Tim Bond of Barclays Capital, who points to rising employment and incomes, which can withstand what he be believes will be gradual increases in rates by the Fed. He adds that June consumption figures were driven as much by the withdrawal of credit terms by car makers than by the oil price. But even optimists highlight short-term risks. DiClemente says: 'Inflation is a risk. We need to see what the causes of the upturn in inflation this year are - is it simply oil?' </p> <p>Bond says: 'We are seeing a synchronised recovery around the world, and we have not seen that throughout the 1990s when inflation was low. This is why investment in capacity by business will be vital in the coming year.' </p> <p>Bond believes that who wins the election is key. 'The Republicans are so well disposed to the wealthy, that if they win, the immediate reaction in markets will be positive.' But he adds that a longer view is needed. 'There are two reasons. First, fiscally, Kerry would redistribute from the very wealthy to those more likely to consume - the middle classes - while remaining fiscally neutral. That is wise, given the outlook, and reflects the presence on his team of some of Clinton's top economics team: Robert Rubin and Roger Altman.' </p> <p>Second, geopolitically, a Kerry win says America is less likely to be involved in foreign wars. 'This is good for business confidence, which is vital to investment which, we believe, is the key to growth in the next phase of the economic cycle.' </p> <p>In this, war, terrorism and the economy are tied up. The noise from the campaign may be about security and war. But Americans at home and at work may really be saying again 'it is the economy, stupid'.</p>",
  "America's ailing economy has become central to the battle for the White House, amid growing signs that the country's recovery from recession is stuttering to a halt. <p>The economy is now seen as a potentially winning issue for Democrat challenger John Kerry, who made it one of the key planks of his campaign speeches as he stumped last week through the Midwest swing states. </p> <p>Kerry's tactics were given a boost yesterday when a new poll in two key battleground states showed the Massachusetts senator in a healthy lead over President George Bush. The study showed that in the key state of Florida, which decided the 2000 election, Kerry led Bush by 50 per cent to 43 per cent. In New Hampshire, which only narrowly went Republican in 2000, Kerry was ahead of Bush by 49 points to 42, the American Research Group poll showed. </p> <p>Experts believe that Kerry is benefiting from positive press after staging a successful recent party convention. 'You can logically conclude that the convention brought wayward Democrats back to Kerry,' said ARC president Dick Bennett. </p> <p>At the same time Bush has been slammed by a wave of bleak news on the economy. On Friday, the government released its latest job creation figures which showed a mere 32,000 new jobs were added to the economy last month. That was way below forecasts which had envisaged at least a quarter of a million new jobs. </p> <p>The disastrous figures scotched hopes earlier this year that America's economic recovery was roaring along and about to deprive the Democrats of one of their strongest criticisms of Bush's record. Now the opposite appears to hold true. </p> <p>As well as the job figures, recent weeks have seen a huge slide in the stock market, which now stands at the same level as it did at the start of the year. A huge rise in oil prices has also knocked US consumers as petrol prices have rocketed above $2 a gallon. That might still seem cheap to many Europeans, but in America it is seen as highly expensive and the price of petrol has become a staple complaint. </p> <p>For the Republican campaign team the grim spectre of the electoral fate of Bush's father is beginning to haunt the campaign. The elder George Bush was ousted in 1992 after just one term by Bill Clinton, as Democrats coined the now famous taunt: 'It's the economy, stupid.' </p> <p>To drive home the point Kerry's campaign has released a new ad that accuses Bush of sacrificing US jobs in favour of tax breaks for companies that move overseas. </p> <p>Since Bush took office in January 2001, the US economy has lost a net 1.1 million jobs. In response, Bush's campaign has centred far more on highlighting the issue of national security. Polls consistently show that Bush leads Kerry when it comes to dealing with the war on terror. But that has fuelled claims that Bush is exploiting a terrorism scare which last week saw the threat level raised in New York, Washington and Newark, New Jersey.</p>",
  "The fattest factor in America's election year hasn't flamed, or even singed, yet. But another hot week of orange alerts, white knuckles and scarlet blushes begins to pose the inevitable awful problem. Who exactly will Osama bin Laden be voting for this November? Is he (whisper it gently) a closet Republican? <p>Take almost any current terror scenario and put it to public opinion. Suppose that the 9/11 commission is right. Suppose that the obvious risk of another al-Qaeda attack turns to bloody reality sometime over the next four months. Who gains? Why, the sitting President, the Commander in Chief. George W Bush declared this 'war' and took his country into battle. It would not desert him if true crisis suddenly returned. </p> <p>Suppose there are significant arrests which net more of Osama's operatives, perhaps even the thin man himself. Who gains? A no-brainer. </p> <p>Or suppose that nothing much happens except the usual blinkings as orange lights return to green, that the dear old Wall Street homeland remains inviolate. Who gains? The Bush boys, though not yet the President himself, are already talking openly about a broken, defeated al-Qaeda, two-thirds of its leadership dead or behind bars. No news for them is the best sort of news. After all, their boss retains most of his approval ratings for handling terrorism. The numbers may be slipping, but they're positive - better than for the economy, far better than Iraq. </p> <p>Anything that keeps in the public eye library pictures of masked Muslims training somewhere in the Hindu Kush, and so-called terrorism 'experts' peddling their TV wares, must be good politics for Bush. Come in Abu al-Hindi, this is your moment. Perhaps there wasn't much of a bounce for Kerry after Boston: the race is probably too frozen, too polarised for that. But the underlying figures in swing states are promising for Kerry and Edwards, their statistics for trust and recognition improving by 10 points or more. </p> <p>So Tom Ridge's amazing discovery of hoary, non-activated plans to blow up some big banks certainly came in useful. Kerry was forced to squirm through his macho saluting act all over again, lantern jaw jutting from here to Vietnam. Not the most fruitful tack. </p> <p>Like all presidential hopefuls, he wants to talk education, health and jobs - none of them a great Bush success story. The July unemployment figures are desperately disappointing for the administration. Kerry beats the President 53:43 there. </p> <p>But Osama keeps dragging Kerry back and nothing, at root, can be decided until the weeks to election day pass without incident. And the memory of the Madrid train bombings casts a miserable shadow. Did al-Qaeda, last March, aim to overthrow Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar's government and set Spanish forces scurrying home from Iraq? Subsequent trial evidence doesn't wholly confirm that. The effect of those bombings may never have been precisely calculated - or slotted into any rational scenario. Osama runs a diffuse agglomeration of an organisation, not the tight-knit hit squads of American imaginings. </p> <p>Nevertheless, if al-Qaeda didn't realise that random carnage can equal precise political power before Madrid, it surely realises it now. Opportunity knocks in America this autumn, just as it will knock in Britain next spring. Knock-knock, who's there? </p> <p>While Mr Bush, like Mr Blair, remains in charge, he has a practical advantage that can't be brushed aside. He is the C-in-C, the main man, the flag-waver supreme. Attack my country and you attack me - which (haplessly, narrowly, deplorably) redounds to my advantage. </p> <p>Stumping round in the wake of Bush and Kerry last week, I was struck by how strained the President looks, and how thin his message sounds. Does the tale of a million jobs created bring crowds to their feet? No: especially after July, it shuffles into silence. Tax cuts? You've had them. Add in health and education spiels which might have been lifted entire from his 2000 election manifesto and the rest is tired rhetoric. 'Four more years, four more years...' </p> <p>Bush's warm-up act, a toxic Texan country and western star, Larry Gatlin, sang what he might have called the Ballad of Abu Graib - shout out that chorus: 'We are the good guys' - but the great leader doesn't even try to be as complicated as that. Between complexity ('flip-flop' in the Bush lexicon) and simple assertion, he picks assertion every time. Saddam was a bad man. The world is safer for his toppling. Other bad men are out there somewhere. He will confront them. God bless America, its veterans, honest folk and happy families; God rot trial lawyers, meddling judges and weapons of mass destruction. He deals with little local difficulties in downtown Najaf by ignoring them completely. What the President chooses to ignore doesn't exist. Four bore years 'moving America forward' (as opposed to down the drain). </p> <p>It is not much of a pitch, and he seems to know it. There's an anxiety about his campaign you can cut with a Bowie knife. But plentiful cash and basic mantras may be enough if terror remains on the front-burner. War cries are potent for George. War brings out the worst in Kerry. </p> <p>Back, then, to the imponderable Osama. Is he still alive? Is his network quite as ropey as the CIA would have us believe? Can he make his electoral mark, a November surprise? And how many voters salute when Howard Dean hints that the Wall Street scare was all got up by the President? </p> <p>A slur too far. America's secret services are too demoralised and leaky to launch a neat conspiracy. They'd fracture when the heat came on. But that, in turn, doesn't mean that assorted agencies from Washington to London aren't working hectically to bring in every suspect or sleeper through the final stages of the election. </p> <p>More activity, more arrests, more bloodcurdling claims, more headlines. The frenzy called Fox News grows almost of its own volition. Timbers shiver by sheer habit. </p> <p>Not all of this should be taken at face value, of course. George Tenet, when he was a revered director of the CIA last year (as opposed to this year's departed stumble bum), cheerfully admitted to Bob Woodward that the agency would make a big noise about tiny scraps of information because it made al-Qaeda think that they knew more than they did. Disinformation was the name of the essential gain - and still is. Feeding four pages of quivering detail to the New York Times last week went far beyond reverence for a free press. Nothing is quite as it seems. The harder the claims, the frailer the handle on truth. </p> <p>Is al-Qaeda quite as fearsome an adversary as both Bush and Kerry now paints it? Does it really take four years of supposedly 'intense surveillance' to mount a truck bombing in Newark, New Jersey? Whatever became of the grand old Duke of York? </p> <p>The peril for Bush is too much continuing strife in Iraq, too many body bags - and too much empty hysteria about terror alerts at home. He could grossly mishandle it. Tom Ridge - anxious to quit at the end of the year to make some money - is a bumbler. Scepticism and cynicism will stalk him through the coming months. But Osama bin Laden, where is he? </p> <p>The Clinton Democrats were sourer on Saudi Arabia than Bush, and Kerry makes jibes at the House of Saud which Osama so despises. You can see a malign logic in sitting this one out. But you can also see an empty stage and a curtain rising. It's an almost operatic challenge - and it beggars certainties till the last hanging chads drop.</p>",
  "<p>At every railway crossing in France there is a solid notice, a panel with writing on it which reads: 'Attention! Un train peut en cacher un autre.' Cartier-Bresson, whatever the event he was photographing, saw the second train and was usually able to include it within his frame. I don't think he did this consciously, it was a gift which came to him, and he felt in the depths of his being that gifts should continually be passed on. He photographed the apparently unseen. And when it was there in his photos it was more than visible. </p> <p>Yesterday he joined the second train. At the age of 95 - with all his agility - he jumped it. He has joined his inspiration. Six years ago he wrote something about inspiration: 'In a world collapsing under the weight of the search for profit, invaded by the insatiable sirens of Techno-science and the greed of Power, by globalisation and the new forms of slavery - beyond all of this, friendship and love exist.' He wrote this in his own handwriting, which was open like a lens which has no shutter. </p> <p>Bullshit! I now hear him saying, look at my drawings, there is no second train in them! So I look at some reproductions of some of his drawings. How drawings change - even 24 hours after a death; their tentativeness disappears, they become final. He said repeatedly in his later years that photography no longer interested him as much as drawing. Drawing - or anyway drawing as he drew - has less to do with the sense of sight than with the sense of touch, with touching the substance and energy of things, with touching the enigma of life without thinking about eternity or the second train. Drawing is a private act. Yet Cartier-Bresson returned to it, knowing very well that it was an act of solidarity with both those who see the second train and those who don't. </p> <p>That's better, he says. </p> <p>An epitaph for him? Yes, a photo he took in Mexico in 1963. It shows a small girl in a deserted street carrying a framed daguerreotype portrait of a beautiful and serene woman which is almost as large as the child. Both are about to disappear behind a tall fence. </p> <p>The last second of visibility, but not of the woman's serenity or the girl's eagerness.</p>",
  "It was a searingly hot summer day in the Pakistani city of Lahore. At the airport, the usual chaos of relatives, taxi drivers and hotel touts stood and sweated outside the concrete concourse. Broken baggage trolleys lay skewed to one side. Bored traffic policemen wearily searched vehicles. <p>In the throng, no one noticed the clean-cut, slightly chubby young man on his way to the airfreight offices to pick up a package. Nobody, that is, except the men who had been watching Muhammad Khan, a key al-Qaeda target, for six weeks. </p> <p>They had begun surveillance following the arrest a month earlier of a man identified as Musaad Aruchi. Aruchi was picked up by Pakistani paramilitary forces, with CIA help, in Karachi. He had been in touch with Khan regularly. Street maps of New York were found in his apartment, as were some computer disks containing information on other American buildings. </p> <p>It was CIA telephone and internet intercepts that led to Aruchi's arrest. He was held by Pakistani intelligence for three days, before being flown out of the country in an unmarked CIA plane. </p> <p>Then the agents pounced on their next target. Khan was surrounded and swept off the pavement into a waiting vehicle to a high-security prison. The Pakistani security forces, which had resisted American pressure to allow the CIA to run the operation, had reason to be pleased with themselves. The 13 July arrest did far more than take down a one-man communications hub for al-Qaeda. </p> <p>When American intelligence experts arrived in Pakistan and started trawling through the 25-year-old's computers and documents, they were astonished. Khan had been in touch with dozens of other activists all over the world, passing on messages given to him by more senior al-Qaeda figures. </p> <p>It was a massive breakthrough. Laid out in front of them was information that could, if played right, lead them to the heart of al-Qaeda's current operations. Plans were hastily laid. Anti-terror specialists were mobilised. Some of Khan's associates were rapidly traced out. One was Khalfan Gailani, a Tanzanian wanted since 1998 for his part in the bombing of the US embassy in his homeland and one of the FBI's 22 most wanted criminals. Gailani was apprehended two weeks ago in Pakistan, after a 12-hour firefight. </p> <p>As American intelligence officers continued to sift through Khan's records, they realised there was a treasure trove of information. 'It is obviously a very serious victory. It is obvious that there is a real find here,' said Gideon Rose, a former member of the National Security Council during the Clinton administration. </p> <p>Khan, it transpired, had attended an al-Qaeda training camp in Afghanistan in the late 1990s and is thought to have associated with Khaled Sheikh Mohammed, the architect of the September 11, 2001 attacks and a militant with extensive experience of aviation. A series of planning documents was stored on disks and a laptop's hard-drive found at Khan's home in a wealthy Lahore suburb. They were surveillance reports, meticulously compiled in a style taught in al-Qaeda training camps, as laid out in the 11-volume 'manual of jihad' compiled by militants in Pakistan. </p> <p>But the most concrete information found on Khan's computer and disks was the existence of five compact files, each one devoted to a separate building in the US. They were the Stock Exchange and Citigroup HQ in New York, insurance giant Prudential Financial in Newark and the IMF and World Bank buildings in Washington. </p> <p>Each document was about 20 printed pages long and mapped out in exact detail a lengthy and comprehensive 'casing' operation that evaluated each building as a target. The files included meticulous logging of pedestrian traffic, the routines of security personnel at the buildings and discussion of which sort of explosives would be best used at each site. The files were written in perfect English. </p> <p>Although it seemed that the research had all been done in 2000 or 2001, at least one of the files on the computer had been opened in January. Nor were documents found on the computer limited to the five buildings. Buildings in other cities, including San Francisco, were mentioned. At least 10 sites in New York alone were found on the computer. In all, there were 500 photographs, drawings and diagrams. Some of them showed underground garages. </p> <p>According to Pakistani officials, there was also evidence of preparations for an attack on Heathrow by British-based activists. There were photographs of terminal buildings and the refuelling centre, as well as of tunnels used by passengers and freight companies. Precise measurements of roads, buildings and underpasses had been recorded. Intelligence sources elsewhere in the region told The Observer last week that the reports had included surveys of underground parking lots so detailed that the gradient of the ramps had been noted. </p> <p>The same sources said the planning also recorded traffic flows on roads around the airport, as well as details of the sequences of traffic lights around the perimeter. </p> <p>Pakistani officials told their American counterparts, and have told The Observer, that the threat was 'present'. They said that Khan had been in touch with six 'jihadi associates' in America. Washington's biggest alarm bells rang. </p> <p>Khan was believed to be a courier of messages between al-Qaeda groups or terrorists. He would receive messages on computer disks and then post them briefly on the internet, using websites hosted in places like Pakistan, Turkey and Nigeria. Though most of the information was old, anti-terrorism experts pointed out that major al-Qaeda attacks were almost always years in the planning. The 11 September attacks were planned for six years and the 1998 attacks on US embassies in east Africa were planned for five years. </p> <p>'I am not alarmed by the age of the intelligence found. I think that just reflects the world view of al-Qaeda operations. They can take years,' said Larry Johnson, a former deputy director of counter-terrorism at the US state department. </p> <p>But, though the material was useful, it was deeply troubling, too. Despite the fact that many of the reports were compiled about 2001, officers around the world knew that a race was on - to find the authors before they could strike. </p> <p>A classic sting was set up. Pakistani intelligence officers prevailed on Khan to work for them. It is not known how he was persuaded to co-operate. The 'deal' was thrashed out at a prison where abuse is commonplace. Last weekend, the young militant finally sent emails to scores of activists in America, Indonesia, Malaysia, Pakistan, India and Bangladesh. He requested that they get in touch urgently. As the emails came back, intelligence officers all over the world went into action. </p> <p>President George W. Bush was on board Air Force One when he was told about the news. It was Friday, 30 July, and the Boeing 747 was flying on the campaign trail through the blue skies of Missouri for another stop on his bid for re-election to the White House. </p> <p>The night before, at Langley, Virginia, top CIA officials had been briefed for the first time on the intelligence on Khan's laptops and disks. After 72 straight hours of work by agents and analysts, translating and compiling the information flowing from Pakistan, officials had decided the information was extremely serious. It was put into a morning briefing paper for the president. </p> <p>Bush told national security adviser Condoleezza Rice they had to counter the threat. The operation was already in the works. Frances Fragos Townsend, Bush's domestic security adviser, had acted immediately on Friday when she saw the reports on her desk. It was not just the CIA report from Pakistan that was worrying her: another stream of intelligence, possibly gleaned from interrogations of recent detainees, was also hinting strongly that an attack in New York was in the works. </p> <p>By the end of Sunday morning, the homeland security secretary Tom Ridge had briefed the Democratic challenger John Kerry by phone on the threat. He then called senior news executives on various television channels and newspapers in a conference call. Ridge described a 'most unusual set of circumstances where, from a variety of different sources that we continue to exploit, there's a convergence of information that compels us to talk publicly about specific potential targets'. </p> <p>A few minutes later Ridge appeared live on American television to tell the world that New York, Newark and Washington were under threat. </p> <p>British authorities had also been alerted, and moved quickly. It was clear from the start that Khan was likely to have connections to the UK. It is thought that Khan - a fluent English-speaker - had visited the UK a number of times, possibly as recently as November 2002. Khan's father worked for Pakistan's state-run airline, PIA, and had obtained five tickets in his son's name for travel between Pakistan and London over the past four to five years. Khan also had relatives in England, at least some of whom shared his political beliefs. </p> <p>Last Tuesday, British police and security services moved in, arresting 13 (and then releasing one immediately) in north London, Watford, Luton and Blackburn under suspicion of terrorism-related offences. All were men, aged between 19 and 32. No names were released by UK authorities, but American officials revealed that one of those arrested was Eisam al-Hindi, whom they alleged was 'chief of al-Qaeda in Britain'. Details about al-Hindi have been thin. One man arrested last week in a separate raid was Babar Ahmad. American officials want to extradite him for terrorist offences relating to Afghanistan and Chechnya. Ahmad is currently in detention. </p> <p>Direct links to senior al-Qaeda figures among British Muslim activists are rare. However, many have had links to other militants in Pakistan who themselves may have connections to al-Qaeda figures. 'That's the nature of modern Islamic militancy,' he said. 'It's all about who you know. It's about personal connections and being able to source the right materials at the right time to carry out your own schemes.' </p> <p>The vast bulk of these men are British citizens of Pakistani descent, although some are from the Middle East who have been naturalised after emigrating to the UK. Many were active in Kashmir during the 1990s, travelling from the UK to Pakistan to join militant outfits launching guerrilla attacks on Indian forces in the parts of Kashmir that are under New Delhi's rule. Such activities were not illegal at the time - though they now are. </p> <p>Many of Britain's Pakistani community are from the Mirpur region, close to Kashmir, and sympathise with the cause, if not the means, of the militants. Hundreds of young Pakistani-descended British citizens have spent a few weeks or months with 'mujahideen' groups, many sponsored by the Pakistani government, in Kashmir or training in Afghanistan or Pakistan in the past decade. </p> <p>'A lot just did a few weeks one summer and then came home, got married and settled down. They are devout Muslims whose faith is an important part of their identity, but not active any more in any kind of radicalism,' said one Islamic activist. </p> <p>However, there are concerns that more recent recruits to militancy may be missed. Sources within the Islamic activist community speak of 'several dozen' young men from Britain who have made their way to Afghanistan since 2001 to fight the Americans. Such men are far more likely to have contact with al-Qaeda and, terrorism experts say, pose a far more imminent threat than 'old warriors'. </p> <p>Police are also concerned that low-level training of militants may be continuing. There are reports of radical Muslim groups organising 'martial training' in east London. 'There's nothing wrong with people practising karate, but we don't know exactly what they are doing. The idea of small groups of young radicalised Muslims getting together after prayers in a mosque to plan any kind of activity that is based in ideas of any kind of violence is concerning,' one security specialist said. 'No one has the resources to monitor these things and it may well be wrong to do so. It could be totally innocent ... but it is also well-known that these kinds of small group activities are a classic conduit to terrorist recruitment.' </p> <p>Despite the arrests, Pakistan is continuing to provide a 'production line' of new terrorists. Along the Afghan-Pakistani frontier, with their high mountains, rugged valleys and fiercely independent, devoutly Muslim and heavily armed inhabitants provide perfect cover for fugitives. Among these dusty, dry hills, a senior Pakistani military officer told The Observer recently, that up to 600 'foreign' militants are hiding. They included Khan and Ghailani and, almost certainly, Osama bin Laden and his closest aides. </p> <p>Most analysts last week agreed that bin Laden was still alive - and probably in relatively good health, despite being on the run for nearly three years. Although al-Qaeda's leader has issued frequent statements on cassettes, he has not appeared in any new video images for some time. </p> <p>The reason, experts say, is that the Saudi master of propaganda is waiting for the right moment, such as after a strike on the scale of 11 September, to appear on the worlds' television screens. Such a return would have a devastating impact on the morale of his pursuers and lift the spirits of his followers immeasurably. </p> <p>The Americans, the Pakistanis and their allies want to stop that happening. But a major push in March, involving regular US troops, the Pakistani army and Afghan militia forces - as well as specialist American units transferred from Iraq - failed to turn up any substantive leads. </p> <p>To launch an attack 'real-time' data is needed, telling the planners where bin Laden is, not where he was. And even should this be obtained, Bush will have to decide whether to use a cruise missile to obliterate the terrorist leader - and risk destroying evidence of his death - or try an immensely risky operation to kill or even capture him. Recent efforts by the Pakistani army to push into the tribal areas - acting as beaters for the American guns - have failed in the face of concerted local resistance. </p> <p>The Pashtun tribes were particularly angered by the assassination of a popular resistance leader, Nek Mohammed, by an American missile that struck while the tribal chief was using a satellite phone to talk to the BBC. </p> <p>'There are grave obstacles, of course in operating in these areas,' a senior Pakistani general said recently. 'But the real problems are caused by the global situation. We are not fighting a campaign in a vacuum.' </p> <p>Analysts no longer talk about al-Qaeda as an organisation. 'It's as much an ideology as a definable group,\" said one security expert. 'It's impossible to estimate how many people are involved. You are a member of al-Qaeda if you say you are and that makes it very hard to tracking individuals and interdict plots,' said one former CIA counter-terrorism agent. 'There are a lot of very angry people out there.' </p> <p>Another trend picked out by analysts is the increasing co-operation between differ ent militant groups. Until recently, Pakistani militants fighting in Kashmir rarely co-operated with Arab militants dedicated to a 'global jihad'. Increasingly, the groups have become indistinguishable. The same phenomenon has been noticed elsewhere. 'It's all fusing into one worldwide \"Jihadi international\",' the former agent said. 'It's moved well beyond bin Laden or a few guys in a cave somewhere. It's now far more fragmented and diverse.' </p> <p>A British intelligence expert who has advised the government said that there were no 'metrics' for judging progress in the war on terror. </p> <p>'Police and intelligence services worldwide are doing their job - taking down cells, locating operatives, breaking up plots - well, and that is having a significant short term impact,' he said. </p> <p>'But long-term success in defeating terorrism doesn't necessarily follow. Four thousand people have been killed or imprisoned since 2001 and, although the loss of experienced, skilled men has an impact, the vacancies are being filled. </p> <p>'In Saudi Arabia they keep arresting \"leaders\" and new one's come forward. There's no shortage of recruits anywhere and that means there will be no shortage of threats in the coming years.' </p> <p>Perhaps the web of contacts uncovered by arresting Khan will reveal further links to al-Qaeda sleepers in America and Britain. But it also might not. 'This is not the key that will unlock all of al-Qaeda,' Rose added. </p> <p>On Thursday, police in Albany, in upstate New York, arrested two local Islamic clerics. They had been caught after a year-long sting operation in which the pair had believed they were laundering money in connection with the purchase of shoulder-fired missiles. The swoop had nothing to do with Khan's network, but showed conclusively that other terrorist dangers still exist. </p> <p>They may have started rounding up Khan's alleged contacts, but the war goes on. The intelligence agencies continue to probe for leads; the enemy continues to regroup and plan for a new 'spectacular'. And the police hunt them. And so it goes on. </p> <p><b>Combating the international jihad</b></p> <p><b>Vigilance is the watchword</b> </p> <p>Since September 11 2001 there have been 622 people arrested under the powers in the terrorism 2000 act. So far 97 of them have been charged with terrorism-related offences and only 15 have actually been convicted. Of the total 152 were charged under other legislation (commonly relating to identify fraud of credit card offences) or released into the custody of the immigration service. 284 have been released without charge. </p> <p>Spending on protecting the UK from terrorism is expected to reach \u00a32.1 billion by 2007-8, more than double the amount before the September 11 attacks. MI5, MI6 and GCHQ are to receive funding for 1,000 extra intelligence staff and local authorities will have additional resources for civil defence preparations. Worldwide, 625 people were killed in terrorist attacks during 2003. The number of individual attacks rose from 205 to 208. The number of deaths was down from 2002 when 725 were killed but the numbers wounded rose significantly from 2,013 in 2002 to 3,646 in 2003. The increase has been attributed to an increase in the number of attacks on 'soft targets' including places of worship, hotels and commercial districts which are intended to produce large numbers of casualties. </p> <p>Despite the threat of a possible terrorist attack on London, tourists are visiting the capital in record numbers. The latest statistics reveal that 6.5 million visitors came to the UK between March and May, a rise of 21 per cent and the highest number ever recorded during this period. Around half stayed in the capital. Passenger numbers arriving at British airports increased by 7 per cent in June alone. There has also been a 17 per cent rise in the number of Americans visiting the UK, something credited to the huge popularity of Tony Blair across America. Last month twenty five million copies of a government booklet, 'Preparing for Emergencies', which gives advice on what to do in the event of a major terrorist attack and other emergencies, were sent out to households across the country. The Government has denied the publication of the booklet is any indication of an imminent attack.</p>",
  "The party that built apartheid and turned South Africa into a pariah state completed its march to oblivion yesterday by deciding to merge with its one-time nemesis, the African National Congress. <p>The New National Party, heir of a mighty movement that jailed Nelson Mandela and built nuclear bombs, said its shrunken membership would dissolve and fight future elections under the banner of the black ruling party. </p> <p>A meeting of the NNP's federal council proposed that members join the ANC, a bitterly ironic twist for a party founded almost a century ago to promote the interests of white Afrikaners and keep blacks from power. </p> <p>Officials are to retain their party membership and parliamentary and local government seats as a transitional arrangement until September 2005. 'Individual members of the NNP would be encouraged to join the ANC in their respective localities. The NNP will in future contest elections under the banner of the ANC,' the NNP said in a statement. </p> <p>Moisua Lekota, the Defence Minister, an ANC heavyweight nicknamed Terror during the struggle, welcomed the decision. </p> <p>Just a decade ago such a marriage would have been dismissed as a surreal impossibility, but the NNP is so enfeebled from successive electoral batterings that the wonder yesterday was how it managed to last so long since dismantling apartheid. </p> <p>In the first democratic elections in 1994 it won 20 per cent of the vote by promising to defend the rights of whites and coloureds, those of mixed race, in a black-dominated ANC-led government. </p> <p>When F.W. de Klerk stepped down as leader two years later, the party lost a towering figure and direction. The Nobel laureate's successor, Marthinus van Schalkwyk, was derisively nicknamed kortbroek (short pants). Tasked with trans forming a racist dinosaur, he borrowed from Tony Blair by putting 'New' in front of National Party and rebranded it as a mixed-race movement committed to the ideals of Desmond Tutu's 'rainbow nation'. </p> <p>Its shrivelled support in Western Cape bought an alliance with the ANC, which was a few votes shy of a majority in the provincial legislature, but the writing was on the wall in April's election when its national vote collapsed to 1.7 per cent. </p> <p>Whites disgruntled with the ANC backed the Democratic Alliance and other opposition parties that were more vocal in criticising the ruling party, which won more than two-thirds of the vote. </p> <p>Van Schalkwyk was appointed Tourism and Environmental Affairs Minister by President Thabo Mbeki, but his party lacked resources and morale. Yesterday he said he would join the ANC within weeks. </p> <p>Formed in 1914 by General J.B.M. Hertzog, the NNP became a hardline Afrikaner party under Daniel Malan and in 1948 took power and entrenched the politics of racial separation. As opposition grew, it turned South Africa into a police state which murdered, tortured and jailed dissidents. It is difficult to find anyone today who admits supporting them, but the party enjoyed widespread white backing for decades. </p> <p>South African politician Mangosuthu Buthelezi said yesterday that Aids had killed his daughter, his second child to die from the disease this year, and slammed the government's handling of the pandemic. </p> <p>Buthelezi, head of the Inkatha Freedom party, is one of the few high-profile figures to talk candidly about the disease that affects 10 per cent of the population. 'Tragically, Mandisi's untimely death should have been averted, for she also succumbed to the disease that is unmercifully mowing down many of our people,' he said at his daughter's funeral in Mahlabathini in KwaZulu-Natal province.</p>",
  "The European Commission needs a radical shakeup to combat complaints that it is 'remote and out of touch', one of the Prime Minister's closest allies admits today. Parliaments should approve or reject programmes from Brussels before commissioners start work on them, former minister Stephen Byers said. <p>With polls showing Britons becoming increasingly Eurosceptic, Downing Street is planning a 'softening-up' campaign of tackling grievances about the EU in the run-up to the referendum on the European constitution.</p> <p>The call from Byers - who remains close both to Tony Blair and to the new EU commissioner Peter Mandelson - is the first sign of the emerging strategy. </p> <p>'This new commission will be one that makes or breaks Europe: if it's seen to be a remote, out-of-touch elite then it will fail,' Byers said.</p> <p>'The commission must never seek to deny that, for most Europeans, cultural and political identity is rooted in the nation state. The network of national parliaments must have an increased role in shaping the future of Europe.</p> <p>Mandelson is expected to lead the argument for reform when he takes up the job formally this autumn.</p> <p>The commission president - Portugal's Jos\u00e9 Barroso - and individual commissioners should publish a manifesto detailing their draft programme, which would then have to be debated and cleared by national parliaments first, Byers said.</p> <p>Commons committees should also be able to interrogate commissioners - who wield most of the active power in Brussels - as they do ministers. The Leader of the Commons, Peter Hain, is already studying plans to make them more accountable to parliament.</p> <p>Byers said such reforms would give the government 'a chance of persuading people that Europe provides us with a partnership from which we can benefit, and not a conspiracy against us'.</p> <p>Downing Street and the Foreign Office have already begun 'focus grouping' potential messages on the benefits of Europe, with a fledgling referendum campaign structure meant to be in place by autumn. Polls currently show public opinion against the constitution by two to one.</p> <p>Although ministers insist the referendum, which must be held by October 2006, is winnable, the stakes are high, with Blair arguing that the choice is effectively to be in Europe or out of it.</p> <p>Although next autumn remains the most likely date - particularly if Labour wins the election by another big majority, giving it a 'honeymoon period' to force through the constitution - some aides are arguing for it to be deferred until 2006.</p> <p>Some MPs are sceptical that it will ever happen, since the constitution could then be killed off by other countries voting against it before Britain voted. But Blair has insisted that Britain would hold a referendum regardless.</p>",
  "<p>As crude prices reached record levels in London and New York last week, the spectre of an oil shock derailing global economic recovery began to rise. </p> <p>Prices spiked to $44.77 in New York in response to Opec president Purnomo Yusgiantoro's assertion that there was 'no more supply' to meet spiralling demand. They did not cool in response to a statement later in the week that, thanks largely to Saudi Arabia, the cartel could find another 1million to 1.5 million barrels a day (mb/d) after all. </p> <p>Analysts are agreed that supply is struggling to keep up with demand, and that it is unlikely to do so until next year. </p> <p>David Fyfe of the Paris-based International Energy Agency, says: 'We do see spare capacity within the system as being very tight.' Leo Drollas, chief economist at the London-based Centre for Global Energy Studies (CGES) agrees: 'The worrying thing is spare capacity. We were running at the end of July with 2 per cent spare capacity in the world. There is none outside Opec.' That is why Yusgiantoro's remarks sparked such a reaction last week. </p> <p>There are wider concerns feeding the price. Fears over disruption of supply have been present for months - an attack on an oil installation in Saudi Arabia, political instability in Venezuela or Nigeria, or, more recently, disruption in supply from Russia because of problems at producer Yukos. </p> <p>The 'Problem', says Drollas, is that while previously it would have taken a combination of these to bring serious supply/demand difficulties, now, with things so tight, one alone could do it. </p> <p>The key difficulty is continued strong demand, par ticularly in China, the Far East generally and India. </p> <p>The most visible hot-spot, however, is America, where shortage of oil is ratcheting up gasoline prices during the 'driving season' at a time when suppliers need to start stockpiling heating oil for the winter. In addition, US refineries are already at historically high levels of production - running rates are in the high 90 per cent range. It makes for a potentially inflammatory combination leading up to November's presidential election. </p> <p>Drollas says that America has 18.5 days of supply when it would expect to have 20. The US consumes some 20mb/d. This means it is short of something like 25 million barrels of stocks. 'That is an awful lot short of what they should have in their tanks,' he says. </p> <p>But there is a mystery in the figures. Global oil demand is approximately 81mb/d. With non-Opec crude production at 49.92mb/d and Opec's at 29.36mb/d, plus 3.51mb/d extra for gas and other liquids, total production is 82.8. This suggests that stocks should be building by 1.8mb/d globally, which would normally be enough to see prices fall. </p> <p>So the question is, where is that oil going? Some believe it may be going undisclosed to China or India. Drollas believes that there is stock-building, but because of the tightness in immediately available capacity and the wide range of credible threats to supply, nerves are keeping the price up. </p> <p>So when will there be a fundamental shift? </p> <p>Fyfe points to investment in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Algeria, Libya and Nigeria within Opec that will see increased production. Outside, he points to investment in Russia, Africa and elsewhere in Latin America that will see non-Opec capacity rise from 50.1mb/d this year to 51.3 next. CGES estimates Opec growth at 1.5m barrels in 2005, so the total figure should be about 2.6mb/d. </p> <p>With predictions for a moderation of growth in the US and elsewhere, there should be a cooling at some point. </p> <p>But Drollas says: 'You will have to wait until there is a decline in demand growth [rather] than extra supplies coming on, and that will not be until next year.' </p> <p>The question economists will be puzzling over in the meantime is, will that be soon enough to avoid a shock?</p>",
  "<p>Here's a question that dare barely speak its name. Is the New York Times ... well, you know, sort of ... liberal? The awful L word. And here comes the NYT's increasingly notorious outside ombudsman, Daniel Ockrent, confirming every conservative suspicion. Yes, 'of course it's a liberal newspaper'. </p> <p>Much writhing in the political marsh. The Times aspires to high-quality reporting and lofty commentary. It hates the idea of being cast as some kind of pinko clone of Fox News. All the hate that fits, we print. But maybe the point goes rather deeper than that. </p> <p>One Times ploy, coming away from the Democratic convention, was to mount a slightly ad hoc poll of 153 political journalists. Which candidate do you like best? Correspondents from the country at large backed Kerry three to one. Correspondents based in Washington made that 12 to one. The bulk of the US press corps covering this election is overwhelmingly Democrat. </p> <p>No huge surprise there, perhaps. Much the same is probably true almost wherever you look in the British press. (Remember: it was a freshly re-unionised Daily Telegraph, led by the paper's fiery society gossip columnist, which threatened strike action as the Barclays first came knocking.) But, in a US context, the balancing act seems particularly odd. </p> <p>Fox glories in its conservatism and ratings. Radio talk shows of the Rush Limbaugh ilk snarl at Kerry day after day. Right-wing newspapers - such as the one Teresa Heinz Kerry, left, wished would 'shove it' - throw constant punches without breaking sweat. But what does the rest of press and broadcasting do? They know what side they're on. In private, they can be as vitriolic about Bush and Cheney as Limbaugh about Edwards and Kerry. Al Franken is building a radio following as a non-rightist Rush. But in public they have to be 'fair and independent', which seems to mean never quite saying what they believe, always fudging along behind the neo-con agenda. Be a closet Democrat: be guilty about it: be neutered. And anyone in search of a decent debate, be damned.</p> <p><strong>Another Foot in the grave of journalism that mattered</strong></p> <p>A few days ago, after more than half a century at typewriter and terminal, an 81-year-old reporter with Parkinson's disease finally gave up his syndicated column and put himself on journalism's final spike. </p> <p>So farewell, Jack Anderson. Once upon a time, pretty conclusively, the Nixon White House tried to poison you (via Mafia intermediaries). Once upon a high old time, 30 years ago, more than 1,000 papers - and 40 million readers - rode on your Washington Merry-Go-Round, a ripe old brew of revelation, gossip, innuendo, leaden prose and self-aggrandisement. </p> <p>But the question asked as the ancient showboater limps into the sunset is also the question that ran through British journalism after Paul Foot's emotional funeral. When shall we see his like again? </p> <p>Foot, in doggedness, eloquence and principle, was far ahead of Anderson, of course. He deserved - and would have hooted at - the tributes showered upon him, while Anderson has merely subsided into obscurity. </p> <p>Nevertheless, Anderson built a career because that syndicated column made him his own master, a voice across America that swayed votes and influenced people - and Foot, Boxing and Coxing between Private Eye, the Mirror and (later) the Guardian, had a roughly similar range of access. He could nip and bite and follow through. He didn't have to strive for the big bang. He was always, always trouble. </p> <p>Their like again? Forget it, alas, until that access - a relic in America, a lost dream in Britain - rises again. Despite the sneers, syndication was the strength that launched 1,000 scoops.</p>",
  "<p>Overdosed on plastic convention pap? Ready to hit the great open campaign trail, breathe fresh air, raise real issues, meet real people? Poised to run a more serious, more meaningful media circus? Forget it. </p> <p>Whether you're cooped up in a giant Boston auditorium or following campaign convoys through heartland Iowa, the message is curiously similar. People - your readers or viewers - are just props and photo-ops. You're not serving them, merely exploiting them. </p> <p>That, of course, has long been broadly true of British as well as American elections. Remember John Major bleating from his soapbox or Shirtsleeves Tony holding his town forums. American candidates since Reagan have criss-crossed the country only because a local stop gets them on local TV. The point is not to meet or to greet, just to be seen on screen. </p> <p>But the age of terrorism has pushed such distancing to an ever more remote level. Take Davenport, Iowa, along the Mississippi, last week, and one of those rare coincidences which finds John Kerry and George W Bush in town - only three blocks apart - at the same time. </p> <p>Can you catch a glimpse of both of them? No. Kerry is indoors, talking to an 'invited' audience (which means 'business leaders' and his own travelling press). Bush is outdoors in a local park, but the gates are shut at 9.30 am and the President doesn't turn up until more than two hours after that. The only way to get out - pursued by at least one valiant political junkie -is to have a heart attack and be wheeled to freedom. </p> <p>Coming into the park to begin with means five separate credential checks, an electronic search and various Secret Service interventions. You need to have collected your ticket much earlier from the local Republican offices - and flourished those credentials individually - even before starting the obstacle race. </p> <p>In other words, this is not an ordinary political meeting, but a rally for the faithful. It is an utterly contrived, insulated event, the crowd coached in chants and flag-waving long before Air Force One touches down. The banners saying 'Sportsmen for Bush' or 'Veterans for Bush' are distributed to anyone who can raise an arm. Advance men make sure that the crowds nearest the President have paper tassels to wave. </p> <p>It is a media show, the press tribes from Washington swarming off the President's plane, driving at high speed in his wake, then hopping back on the plane. They are there, but that is all they are. So are the local press waiting on a lowlier stage - but they have their local stations to serve once Bush has sped away to Minnesota and his next cocoon. </p> <p>What did it amount to? Ritual news clips of greater or lesser length according to station proximity. The Davenport paper saw 'Bush roll up his sleeves' (take his jacket off) and 'campaign on results' (give his bog-standard stump speech). Kerry ('We can do better') did no better. </p> <p>And so the convention issue continues. We constantly write editorials lamenting the decline of democratic involvement, but succumb to coverage which leaves any involvement on the back of the bus. </p> <p>It would have been cheaper - and as meaningless - to have chartered a 747 to take Davenport trusties to Washington to hear the President, then flown them home again. Same speech, same pictures, same inexorable lack of time. </p> <p>Security hasn't merely restricted the way America does its electoral business. It has totally changed it. The crux of this election - as everybody from the Washington Post to the Washington Times agrees - is getting out the undecided vote. But the one group you never hear from or see on television is the undecided. They 'um and er' too much, you see. They're too much of a risk to let into the rallies.</p>",
  "<p>What have John Kerry, Angelina Jolie, Robin Williams, Andre Agassi and Bono got in common? They are all donning 2004's must-wear fashion accessory - a yellow wrist band inscribed with the words 'LIVE STRONG'. </p> <p>Forget the $20 red string Kabbalah wrist band worn by the likes of Madonna and Britney Spears. This season Kevin Federline - Spears's fianc\u00e9 - has upped her in the trend stakes by strapping on the yellow wristband that has taken America and now the UK by storm. And it only costs $1. </p> <p>The force behind the bracelets is the Lance Armstrong Foundation - the charity set up by the cyclist in 1997 when he was diagnosed with testicular cancer - in a bid to raise $5m. The first five million bands were produced by Nike, who also gave $1m to the foundation. By mid July the bands had all been sold. Six million more were produced and already half have sold. So far the charity has raked in $8m from the bands. </p> <p>After recovering from the cancer, Armstrong won the Tour de France in 1999. Since then he has won it every year - taking the crown for the sixth time last month and entering the record books as the first man to achieve such a feat. </p> <p>His message for people to 'live strong' is aimed at helping cancer sufferers and survivors to cope with it, using education, research and support. It also aims to show that cancer is not a disease only for the elderly. </p> <p>'Young people with cancer should be empowered to fight hard, dream big and live strong,' Armstrong said when the bands were launched. His popularity in America has ensured the success of the campaign and stamped the colour yellow down as a symbol of his determination to 'raise awareness, funds and even spirits.' </p> <p>In New York punters have searched the streets for the precious fashion accessories, which are snapped up as soon as they appear on the shelves of Niketown or other sports shops. In the UK Niketown has also started to stock the bands, and they can be ordered on the website. </p> <p>'It is a fashion statement but we will happily take that because it is raising so much money for our cause,' said Michelle Milford from the Lance Armstrong foundation. 'It is great that the summer's hottest accessory is also raising money for cancer. During July we sold half a million in one week alone.' </p> <p>On the last day of the Tour de France, as Armstrong made his way up the Champs Elysees, 25,000 were sold. Another 400,000 were snapped up in the next three days. Jay Leno distributed them to his audience in July and got his guests to sign a yellow jersey that was also sold to raise funds. </p> <p>Fashion expert Ollie Picton-Jones said: 'We welcome any alternative to the Kabbalah bracelet. This wristband is healthy because it is not about celebrity brainwashing. 'Live Strong' is a great message.' </p> <p>Bill Clinton, Ben Affleck and Gwyneth Paltrow - who lost her father to cancer - are the latest to have purchased it along with sports stars including Serena Williams and Armstrong's rival Ivan Basso, whose mother is battling with pancreatic cancer. Many athletes are expected to wear the bracelets at the Olympic Games. </p> <p>'One in three people experience cancer in a lifetime,' said Milford. 'We are very appreciative of all the people who have bought the bands. Wearing the wrist band shows support for people battling cancer or can be to honour someone you have lost to cancer.' </p> <p>And the campaign has gone beyond wrist-bands. Last month saw a charity auction of one-off yellow garments and accessories made by some of the world's top fashion designers. Featured items included an Oscar de la Renta yellow dress and clutch worth $15,000 and a Louis Vuitton custom-made yellow Epi hatbox and an 18-carat gold bracelet worth $7,000. There was also a pair of thigh high suede banana boots donated by Manolo Blahnik. </p> <p>The charity currently has no plans to produce more bands once the final three million are sold as they have made more than they planned to fund this year's events and projects. The popularity of the bands is similar to the red ribbon for Aids and the pink ribbon for breast cancer, but has the added value of being extremely fashionable. The fact they are the hardest fashion item to get hold of makes them even more desirable. </p> <p>Tavo Zavala is a project co-ordinator of Teen Impact, a programme at children's hospital in Los Angeles that supports adolescents with cancer and also contributes to the Lance Armstrong website. Now 31, Zavala survived leukemia when he was 12 and thinks that Armstrong's work has done exceptional things for awareness of cancer. </p> <p>'Lance has done something that no man has ever done before and in America that is how we judge heroes,' he said. 'Then you add to that the fact that he did it when he should not even be alive. He has raised awareness about the fact people do get cancer in their 20s and it does not have to be a instant death sentence. The wrist-bands have been a great vehicle for awareness and the celebrities are helping tremendously in raising attention and money. It is fantastic that people are picking a trend that has a human aspect as well as being cool and flashy.'</p>",
  "<p>Hollywood has always been an acutely political place but with rare exceptions it has generally shied away from projecting its allegiances on to the screen. But with politics as the single most energising - and polarising - subject in a presidential election year, the film business is no longer so squeamish about divisive material. </p> <p>In the wake of Fahrenheit 9/11, Michael Moore's polemical anti-Bush documentary that has taken more than $100 million at the box office, making it the most successful documentary of all time, the business is preparing to release more films with overt political messages than at any time since the collapse of the Nixon administration. </p> <p>At the very least, says Bob Thomson, media studies professor at Syracuse University, Hollywood is less afraid than it was immediately after 11 September: 'People were wondering if anyone would ever tell a joke about the President again, or if there would ever be another explosion in the movies.' </p> <p>Last week Paramount Pictures released director Jonathan Demme's remake of a 1962 classic of paranoia and global misgivings, The Manchurian Candidate. With a sinister multinational conglomerate in place of the original's communist power, and Denzel Washington standing in for Frank Sinatra, the $80m film took $20m in its first three days. </p> <p>While it is not overtly partisan, it is hard not to view it through the lens of current events. </p> <p>It is a very, very angry movie, says producer Scott Rudin, identifying the central emotion of the electoral season. The film-makers acknowledge that the global corporation at the centre of the plot is a virtual stand-in for Halliburton, and Republicans who have seen the film tend to view the candidate - a decorated war hero from a good family - as a stand-in for Senator Kerry. </p> <p>With the nation so bitterly divided in the run-up to the November election, Paramount studio head Sherry Lansing says the film is a Rorschach test. 'With the nation's eye focused on a presidential election this year, I couldn't think of a better time to address darker themes about the political process and the forces that try to undermine it,' says Demme. </p> <p>According to Thomson, the political allusions are less significant than Hollywood's realisation that national politics can make for successful programming. 'Like The West Wing, The Manchurian candidate is cashing in on the fact that the news cycle has turned national politics into a rich mine of entertainment,' he says. But he cautions that political entertainment should not be read as necessarily political. 'Regardless of the politics of the executive or the star, the one thing they want to do is to make everybody lots of money. It's still showbusiness.' </p> <p>Not all the politically oriented films out between now and November are drenched in paranoia. Trey Parker and Matt Stone, makers of South Park, are soon to release their own look at runaway US imperialism, Team America: World Police . With the tagline 'Putting the \"F\" back in freedom', and a plot described as 'Superheroes fight to end terrorism and put tired celebrities out of their misery', the film's satire is likely to be as offensive as South Park. </p> <p>Film-makers look back to the last time Hollywood had its finger on a political pulse - to the mid-Seventies and films like Chinatown, The conversation and All the president's Men. 'People felt galvanised then just as we do now - it galvanises you to be living through a nightmare,' says producer John Calley, who was head of Warner Bros when the studio released All the President's Men. </p> <p>'There was a terrible sense of discontent about our society, though I have to say that Watergate was nothing compared with what we have now.' </p> <p>Emerging from a long period in which Hollywood has produced little more than comic-book fantasies and teen comedies, films with social and political import are finally fashionable again. And not all of them are sub tle. Next month, John Sayles releases Silver City, a thriller about an Enron-style energy company that selects a born-again son of a powerful senator to run for high public office with the backing of the oil industry. </p> <p>She Hate Me, Spike Lee's take on our current condition, is about a corporate whistleblower who supports himself by being a sperm donor for lesbian couples. 'Most mass entertainment is an opiate - it puts you in a stupor,' Lee told the Los Angeles Times. 'When I look at great films like On the waterfront, A Face in the Crowd or The Battle of Algiers, those are movies about people trying to make something happen. They make you want to do something when you get out of the theatre.' </p> <p>Exactly what, Lee does not say, but there's no shortage of stimulation and all of it - with the exception of Walt Disney Pictures' patriotic America's Heart and Soul - anti-Bush or anti all those perceived to do the administration's bidding. </p> <p>Already out or soon forthcoming are the documentaries Outfoxed: Rupert Murdoch's War on Journalism, The Hunting of the President, Uncovered: the Whole Truth about the Iraq War, Bush's Brain, profiling Bush's political mastermind Karl Rove, and Persons of Interest, a provocative look at the detention of Arab and Muslim immigrants in the US. And coming this autumn are two pro-John Kerry documentaries, Inside the Bubble and Tour of Duty. </p> <p>According to Thomson, the political documentary has the potential to be for the left what talk radio is for the right. 'The left has finally found a medium,' he says. </p> <p>Of the entertainment industry's most famous political sons, Ronald Reagan was Republican, as is Arnold Schwarzenegger, but Hollywood is unlikely to let up with the anti-Bush drumbeat between now and November. With the sense that the administration is weak, those that might otherwise keep their affiliations to themselves are becoming vocal. Last week, Bruce Springsteen announced he would take part in a 'Vote for change' tour that sets off in early October. </p> <p>'Our goal is to change the direction of the government and change the current administration come November,' he said, and accused Bush of undertaking an 'unnecessary war in Iraq', running record budget deficits, cutting spending on social programmes and giving tax cuts to the richest Americans - himself included. </p> <p>Anger and paranoia is only so entertaining, and Hollywood is getting set to indulge the romantic idealism of the revolutionary again with at least three films completed or in production about Che Guevara. </p> <p>Still, as Joel Achenbach of the Washington Post pointed out last week, paranoia, a permanent element of American politics, is adaptive. 'The question you have to ask yourself is: Who am I worried about now? If it weren't for fear, loathing, paranoia and anxiety, the American electorate would have almost no feelings whatsoever,' he wrote. </p> <p>How long the entertainment industry can remain so politicised is an open question. Thomson predicts that the success of Fahrenheit 9/11 will ensure that the political documentary is here to stay. 'The fact that it can bring in $100m and people are going to see it by choice is tempting to so many people who'd love to get overt ideological stuff out and have people pay for it. My guess is that this is just the beginning.'</p>",
  "I guess it was an odd choice of assignment that as a stand-up comedian I would choose to make a television documentary about working and living on low wages. <p>Between April and November last year, I had a go at four traditionally low-paid jobs in Ireland -- working at a kebab house in Waterford, a swimming pool in Tralee, County Kerry, a hotel in Dublin and a supermarket in Dundalk, County Louth. </p> <p>The first two jobs paid the statutory minimum wage in Ireland at the time - \u20ac6.35 (\u00a34.20) an hour. The third paid \u20ac6.60 (\u00a34.35) and the last paid \u20ac7.45 (\u00a34.95). I worked in each job for a month and started each month with \u20ac150 (\u00a3100). The rest of the money came only from payments received from the employers who had given us permission to film. </p> <p>As an American, I've always looked at Britain and Ireland through the eyes of an outsider, but the following steps will work for any native too. The best way to drum up massive amounts of resentment in yourself about the now much-publicised dark side of Britain and Ireland's night-time social habits, is to work 48 hours a week in a fast food outlet. </p> <p>To thoroughly water the plants of bitterness, it should be the night shift and it must end with a good clean-up of the massive amounts of slop that the drunken hordes leave behind. For best results, sweep the streets as the late spring sun begins to rise and meditate on the uneaten chicken baguette meal lying soggy at your feet amid the other rubbish. Let your thoughts ponder on the fact that, at a cost of \u20ac7 (\u00a34.65), this is worth 65 cents more than an hour of your labour and has been tossed on the ground as worthless. It does not do wonders for your self-esteem. </p> <p>We all know about the crime associated with rampant alcohol abuse, but it's easy to forget the victims of our modern nightlife who deal with it night after night. Most of my colleagues were foreign, predominantly Chinese and persistently subjected to abuse. I had to personally explain to one of my Chinese colleagues what \"chink\" meant after a man left shouting the word, too drunk to be served. </p> <p>So what about the money? Well, in Tralee, the real annoyance of my lowly swimming pool job was the fact that you got paid every two weeks. My unfortunate arrival date meant it would be nearly a fortnight before I got my first pay cheque. And I had no moral support - these were summer jobs for most of my colleagues. At least half the staff were under 18 and receiving only \u20ac5 (\u00a33.30), which they considered, spending money. They didn't have to worry about the basics of survival. </p> <p>After a week, I had to get a sub from my employers. However, I miscalculated how it would affect my first real pay cheque. In the meantime I called in sick one day and had to go to the doctor, which cost me \u20ac35 (\u00a323) plus the loss of pay for the day off. The doctor wrote me a prescription, and I had to wait until payday before I could collect it. Because of my miscalculation, and the fact that my prescription turned out to be quite expensive, I had to get another sub. As a result, on the day I finished my month in Tralee, it was only the second scheduled payday of my time there and I re ceived only one week's pay. </p> <p>I finished with one question in my head: how long does it take to get your head above water? My expenses in Tralee were the cheapest of the whole documentary. My rent was only \u20ac40 (\u00a326) and I never spent a penny on alcohol, never went out to eat, didn't buy any clothes and obviously had no dependants. After one month, I was a week behind on my budgeting. </p> <p>You start to get funny thoughts when you're on your third month of working on what I discovered to be a subsistence wage. Thoughts such as: \"If there is a minimum wage, how come there is no maximum wage?\" </p> <p>Despite the fact that when I got to Dublin I would be getting an extra 25 cents an hour, the big city didn't do me any favours. I tried bedsit living and at \u20ac90 (\u00a360) a week, with my Tralee experience in mind, I had worries. The cost of Dublin was unbearable. Recently it was listed as one of the top five most expensive places to live in the Euro zone. With that came an incredible loneliness as my ability to do anything was seriously inhibited by the tightest of budgets. For the first time in the whole documentary I ended up with no money, two days before my second pay cheque. Due to the higher rent, my food stocks were at their lowest as well, and for those two days I lived on tuna and pasta that I had stocked up on from Tesco, and was helped by the fact that you could get a meal in the hotel I was working in. </p> <p>At this stage I realised the only way to survive on these wages was to work more hours. The average 40-hour week was insufficient for even the basics of survival, especially considering that emergencies always seem to arise. </p> <p>Most people in Ireland believe that foreign workers are coming over here to save money as it compares well against what they could earn at home. This is true, but they have to work at least six days a week and more than eight hours a day. Now perhaps I am spoiled, but that does not seem like the greatest quality of life to me. I found it hard enough working 40 hours. I'm aware that it's a means to an end but it seems like a huge sacrifice. </p> <p>During the final month I tried to live with a looser budget due to my increase in wages but, unfortunately, tax kicked in and although I had a little more money it was not the release I was looking for. No matter what, I always ended up with no money just before payday. </p> <p>So now, as I write this, I sit in my comfortable flat in a fairly affluent part of the city with a Dublin 4 postcode, which is associated with privilege. When I had finished my stint I came home and bumped into a quite wealthy acquaintance from the local area. Knowing what I had been doing, he asked me: \"What's it like to be back in reality?\" It occurred to me at that moment that I had just left it. In my state of mind I could not help thinking that this \"mochas for \u20ac3 and panini for \u20ac6\" Dublin 4 lifestyle is not reality. Panini is half the sandwich for twice the price and when you're on the minimum wage you don't eat panini. In fact, you don't eat anything with \"-nini\" in it because it just means small. You eat mega sandwiches and you shop in Spar for luncheon roll. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Des Bishop is appearing in his one-man show, The Des Bishop Work Experience, in Edinburgh at The Pleasance Beside until August 31.</p>",
  "<p>Oil prices are dominating the financial headlines. Suddenly every share trader has to be an expert on Opec-speak, Vladimir Putin's spat with Yukos, and the impact of terrorist attacks on Iranian pipelines. Do not be fooled, though, into believing that all stock markets require is a reversal in the rising price of a barrel of crude oil. Their problems run much deeper. </p> <p>The allied forces' swift success in last year's war in Iraq was thought to remove the threat of a surge in oil prices. As the conflict approached, the cost of crude oil rose in anticipation of a prolonged struggle and consequent disruptions to supplies. The war was swift; the peace has been anything but peaceful and the flow of oil from the Middle East has continued. Now, though, crude prices have risen to record levels, breaching those set at the time of the first Gulf war. </p> <p>Those with cool heads and powerful calculators have been swift to counter the headlines about these records. The general rise in inflation over the past 13 years means that oil at $44 a barrel is much more affordable than it was at the same price in 1991. And through changes in consumption and production patterns the world has reduced its dependence on the black stuff. Then, the developed world slid into recession. Now, the edge may simply be taken off economic growth that otherwise remains healthy. </p> <p>While it may be true that there are no grounds for widespread economic panic, the jump in oil prices may yet cause a jolt to the system. At the margin, inflation will be higher and growth slower. The net effect on interest rates might actually be to dampen pressure for dearer money. That presupposes, of course, that inflation doesn't work its way into the general psyche, having effectively lain dormant for the best part of a decade. </p> <p><strong> Glass chins</strong><br> </p> <p> Economic policymakers might view the rise in oil prices with interest, but not yet alarm. Others will be suffering severe palpitations. The airline industry, barely profitable at the best of times, must be terminally unprofitable at $44 oil prices - especially as it insists on waving \u00a31 flights under consumers' noses. Manufacturing industries will be wondering how they can pass higher input prices back out through the factory gate and in many cases concluding that instead they will just have to take them on the chin. </p> <p>Politicians, particularly those with chins of glass, will be concerned about the impact of higher petrol prices on electoral sentiment. This may be no big deal for the British government, with a flexible election date and the reassuring memory that the last fuel price protest left no apparent lasting damage to its popularity. However, President Bush will have his advisers sweating to work out how they can possible neutralise the electoral impact of higher gasoline prices with only three months to run until polling. </p> <p>Equity markets are unsettled by these economic, corporate and political uncertainties. The oil price surge is exacerbating investors' existing worries on all three of these fronts. Sometimes uncertainty is embraced as an opportunity to make money, but only when prices are unambiguously low to start with. However, there is far too much ambiguity about valuations right now for the opportunists to hold sway. </p> <p>Share prices slid lower for the first three weeks of July, rallied sharply at the tail of the month as President Putin appeared to ease his boot off Yukos's throat, but then slumped again this week as it became clear that the oil price slip was merely temporary. This slump came in spite of generally positive corporate news and, in Britain, an expected interest rate rise that was accompanied by unexpectedly reassuring noises from the monetary policy committee. </p> <p><strong> Tense periods</strong><br> </p> <p> The market's malady is a function primarily of valuation. The early stages of interest rate cycles, as policy is tightened in order to head off inflationary pressures, are typically tense periods. The direction of rates is usually clear, but the steepness and scale of their ascent can only be the subject of speculation. Dearer money directly and indirectly cuts into future corporate profits. It also makes alternatives to equity investment - bonds or simply holding cash - look relatively more appealing. </p> <p>The more inflated share valuations are heading into an interest rate upswing, the more difficult it is to live with the uncertainty. And, in this cycle, equities started with pretty rich valuations. Although the decline in share prices, before and after 9/11, was dramatic, it started from a grossly overinflated base. Furthermore, although corporate prospects have improved considerably over the past two years, share prices have risen by just a third from their pre-Iraq war lows. </p> <p>It is difficult to envisage what could cause a decisive recovery in investor confidence. Takeovers, profit surprises, terrorist captures or even oilfield discoveries are likely to founder on the rock of valuations. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Edmond Warner is chief executive of IFX Group </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:edmond.warner@theguardian.com\">edmond.warner@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>George Bush's re-election prospects received a severe setback yesterday when government figures from Washington showed the United States economy producing far fewer jobs than Wall Street had been expecting. </p> <p>The 32,000 July increase in non-farm payrolls - described as \"shockingly low\" by one financial analyst - was almost 200,000 down on market predictions and led to a sharp sell-off in shares and the dollar. </p> <p>With jobs one of the main issues in the race for the White House, analysts said the economy would have to put in an improbably strong performance between now and early November to spare Mr Bush the charge of having presided over a loss of jobs during his tenure. </p> <p>\"It's a huge disappointment, a big surprise,\" said Scott Brown, the chief economist at Raymond James in St Petersburg, Florida. \"It implies a very sharp revision to the overall outlook for the economy.\" </p> <p>John Kerry, the Democratic candidate for the White House, has been campaigning hard on the issue of the loss of more than a million jobs during Mr Bush's stewardship - particularly in the swing states of the midwest, where the labour market has been the weakest. </p> <p>Mr Bush's treasury secretary, John Snow, reflected the administration's disappointment that the gain in jobs last month had failed to match Wall Street's 228,000 forecast. </p> <p>\"We're not satisfied,\" Mr Snow said after the release of data from the US labour department. He added that he still expected the economy's underlying strength to keep expansion intact during the second half of 2004. </p> <p>Financial markets, already rattled by rising oil prices, responded negatively to the news on jobs and started to reconsider their view that the Federal Reserve - America's central bank - would raise rates when it meets next week. </p> <p>The possibility that the Fed might leave rates on hold on Tuesday rather than raise them by a quarter-point, to 1.25%, helped to contain the market's fall. </p> <p>After a fall of more than 150 points on Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average lost a further 90 points in New York yesterday morning to trade well below the 10,000 level. The broader-based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 and the technology-dominated Nasdaq were both at their lowest levels this year. </p> <p>In London, the FTSE 100 index closed down 75.5 points at 4337.9. The dollar lost two cents against the euro and the pound, and was down 1.5% against the yen. Sterling ended the day at $1.8464. </p> <p>On the oil markets, fears that the world's biggest economy might be in danger of losing momentum put a temporary halt to the rise in crude futures, which edged close to $45 a barrel on Thursday night. By lunchtime yesterday, US light crude for September delivery was trading at just over $44 a barrel, slightly down on the day, but traders warned that it might hit $50 a barrel over the coming weeks. </p> <p>A refinery fire in the US coupled with the latest twist in the drama of Russian oil group Yukos added to the nervousness among oil traders. </p> <p>Yukos said its production - which accounts for 2% of global crude supply - could be threatened as early as next week as a result of a Russian government collection order which will confiscate from its bank accounts the $900m required to pay next month's taxes and transportation costs. </p> <p>The justice ministry's news sent Yukos shares dropping yesterday, with the price falling more than 7% in the first 15 minutes of trade on the Moscow Micex currency exchange. Shares were down more than 11% on the Russian stock market at the close of yesterday's trading.</p>",
  "The impulse to exaggerate one's own role in events, while morally reprehensible, is a very human one. Sir John Falstaff does it compulsively; it is one of the reasons why theatre audiences love him. So, some allege, does Jeffrey Archer, though the acclaim seems less widespread in his case. Tony Blair, incautiously reminiscing about seeing Jackie Milburn play for Newcastle in matches that the prime minister was too young to attend, is another to have been caught gilding the lily. <p>The latest public figure to be charged with sexing up his CV is senator John Kerry. Students of Mr Kerry will know that he has indeed occasionally added a percentage point or two to his life story, implying, for example, that in his youth he played a bigger role in John Kennedy's presidential campaign and the voting rights struggle in the deep south than was in fact the case. But now Mr Kerry faces more serious accusations. A group calling itself Swift Boat Veterans for Truth is claiming that he lied about his Vietnam war record. A new televised ad charges that Mr Kerry exaggerated his wounds to win medals, then betrayed his comrades by joining antiwar protests after his discharge. As well as the ad, the group is publishing an anti-Kerry book titled Unfit for Command. </p> <p>With some justice, the Kerry campaign see this as a dirty trick by surrogates of George Bush. Even Republican senator John McCain dubs the ad \"dishonest and dishonourable\" and has called on the Bush campaign to condemn it (the White House has conspicuously failed to do so). In the end, though, negative tactics have a satisfying tendency to backfire. While one of Mr Kerry's war wounds is a matter of some dispute, his others are not. Every time the ad is aired it cannot help telling viewers that Mr Kerry put himself in the line of fire far more often than Mr Bush, who famously avoided going to Vietnam. At the end of a week in which Mr Bush inadvertently said his administration never stops \"thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people\", it is a reminder that the unintended consequence, like the reflex to lay it on a bit, is never very far away.</p>"
