  "The Labour conference will debate the withdrawal of British troops from Iraq this week, after local party delegates voted for it to be included on the agenda. <p>The result of the party's priorities ballot could be profoundly embarrassing for Tony Blair if delegates vote for an early pullout after Iraq's January elections.</p> <p>It could also undermine the party leadership's efforts to focus the conference on \"bread and butter\" domestic issues designed to appeal to voters ahead of next year's expected general election.</p> <p>Alan Milburn, Labour's policy and elections coordinator, said earlier that he wanted the conference to succeed in \"reclaiming the banner for hard-working families - showing people that government is on their side\".</p> <p>While in the first of a series of policy announcements, the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, promised to make new houses available to first-time buyers for \u00a360,000, by earmarking surplus government land for homebuilding. </p> <p>But events in Iraq continued to cast a long shadow over the conference in Brighton, with many fearful about the fate of British hostage Ken Bigley.</p> <p>In an effort to secure his release, Dr Daud Abdullah and Dr Musharraf Hussain of the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) met with the Iraqi president, Ghazi Yawer, and Muslim scholars in Baghdad today.</p> <p>The MCB's Yusuf Islam - formerly known as Cat Stevens - also released a statement pleading for the release of the 62-year-old engineer. </p> <p>Mr Blair, meanwhile, prayed for Mr Bigley at a pre-conference church service this morning, but warned against \"raising false hopes\" when he appeared on BBC's Breakfast with Frost. </p> <p>The prime minister said that the government was \"doing everything we properly and legitimately can\" and that he hoped that \"despite all the difficulties, we can do something\".</p> <p>\"But I just don't know if we are able to or not,\" he added.</p> <p>Mr Bigley will again be at the forefront of the minds of delegates when his brother, Paul, appears by live video link-up at a Labour Against the War fringe meeting tonight.</p> <p>Delegates opposed to the war will be satisfied that it will be debated this week, unlike last year when a specific debate was kept off the agenda. </p> <p>Local party delegates who submitted motions on the issue, many calling for the withdrawal of troops, will meet this evening to meld them into one or two motions.</p> <p>Local party and trade union delegates also voted for debates on the issues of public services, pensions, employment rights and manufacturing.</p>",
  "<p>The caravan three vehicles in front, complete with satellite dish, go-faster stripes and 'Jesus is my Co-Driver' bumper sticker is labouring around the bends of this winding Somerset road and up shallow inclines with all the dynamism of John Kerry. So cumbersome is the beast that the driver apparently cannot see the long zig-zag of cars feinting and retreating in a long queue behind him like a school of stressed-out pilot fish. </p> <p>I'm tempted to overtake but then I check my rearview mirror and catch sight of a sleek, silver, teardrop shaped lump of metal with pleasing retro curves. The T@B, le dernier cri in caravan design, is so compact that it's easy to forget that you are towing it. It doesn't slow you down that much, just keeps you exactly to the speed limit, a wonderfully effective fibreglass and aluminium conscience. </p> <p>It was love at first sight for Andrew and Julia Holder when they spotted a picture of the T@B caravan in a magazine, so they decided to import one from Belgium. They have since bought another and hire them out for the week or weekends, under the name Swiftsilver. </p> <p>How cool is caravanning? Talking to friends two theories emerge. One, that it's like having an ugly best friend - surrounding yourself with uncool stuff makes you look all the cooler. Two, that caravanning is cool in a retro, hippyish kind of way, with overtones of the traveller movement and circuses. </p> <p>(Incidentally, people tell me the word 'cool' is no longer cool, or, that is to say, no longer 'phat'. To paraphrase Grandpa Simpson: 'I used to be with it, but then they changed what \"it\" is.') Whatever. In a totally square, Famous Five (ie un-phat) way, there is something fun about the idea of a weekend's caravanning. </p> <p>My girlfriend Siobhan and I had spent one night in the caravan site attached to the National Trust property at Stourhead, in Wiltshire, and were now heading for one at Kentsford Farm, just outside Watchet, where Coleridge wrote The Rime of the Ancient Mariner. The caravan site at Kentsford Farm is a vast and beautiful orchard, trees groaning with cider apples, begging to be scrumped, peacocks, guinea fowls and strange turkey-like ducks grimble around the place, a brook babbles past, and to complete the Enid Blyton theme there's a steam train that toots past every hour or so. Irritatingly we are not presented with fresh eggs although, lacking Julian's initiative, we didn't ask for any. </p> <p>Both places we stayed at were Caravan Club sites, and if the others are as stunning and well located as this, then I can see the appeal of caravanning. Basically you pitch up, hand over a fiver, untether your caravan, wind out the legs etc in a process that lasts about five minutes and, with the night's billet secure and snug, are then free to head off on an adventure - or alternatively make a cup of tea. </p> <p>The T@B is a very neat piece of design indeed, weighing just 520 kilos - that's three Marlon Brandos circa 1995 - it manages to fit a good-sized double bed, table, booth, fridge, sink, cooker, storage space and even a chemical toilet in its snug interior. Electric lights and a heater ensure an ambient, liveable space - albeit tiny. It also looks phat. A stately pleasure dome indeed. </p> <p>So off we zip to Nether Stowey and take a look around Coleridge's tiny cottage, the one where he hung out with Will Wordsworth, got mumbled on opium and was fortunate enough to be disturbed by a postman just when his poem 'Kubla Khan' was threatening to go the way of Jilly Cooper's Riders. We yomped off onto the spine of the heather-coated Quantock hills and the wonderful 360 degree view that so inspired the royalty of romantic writing. </p> <p>Here's a teaser: on one hand we could cook on the tiny two-ring stove in the caravan (and wash up) or we could get a Michelin-starred chef to do it for us at the Rising Sun at West Bagborough. Hmmmm. If you're ever anywhere in Somerset go to this place. The food was absolutely delicious, the young staff very friendly, and the prices reasonable. After a drink at a harbourside inn in Watchet we headed back to the caravan for a game of chess. What else is there to do? In bed by 11.30pm - oh the joys of the countryside. </p> <p>Waking up in a caravan is weird. First, you have to work out where you are ('oh yes, in a caravan') and then you have to work out where it is. Without leaving the bed (I told you it was compact), I griddled some mushrooms we'd bought at Frome farmers' market. </p> <p>I've always suspected that caravanners were misanthropic creatures (no need to grunt a good morning to the proprietor of the B&amp;B) and my prejudices seemed to be justified by the fact that most Caravan Club sites have a maximum capacity of five vans even though they are often gigantic fields. However, the sight of our quirky abode was enough to break down their instinctive reticence. Apologising for bothering us, they came over to shyly offer their congratulations on having such an 'unusual' looking caravan. </p> <p>'I just had to come over ...' was a common opening gambit to justify this breakdown of caravan-site decorum. I felt like the Pied Piper. I had visions of a phalanx of caravans, our T@B in the front, picking up converts en route, heading off o'er hill and dale towards London to preach the joys of caravanning at Hyde Park Corner. </p> <p>But on site the T@B was singing to the choir. So for research purposes Siobhan and I tried to gauge the reactions we evinced from the youthful general public we passed in the small towns. It's hard to be sure, but I swear the slack jaw of one youth, hanging from the branch of a horse chestnut tree, tightened considerably as we swept past, and at one pedestrian crossing a baby gave a shy smile and possibly even a wink. Comments about the tallest pygmy be damned, I hadn't been this popular since I broke my arm at primary school. </p> <p>Then I got into a bit of trouble when we took a wrong turn out of Bridgwater. Trying to do a three-point turn was a mistake. A crowd of people stood and stared as I jackknifed the caravan, stymying further attempts to move backwards. Red faced and panicking I drew unwanted attention by mistakenly honking the horn. Siobhan helpfully doubled up in laughter as I ploughed on to find the next industrial estate large enough to turn in. When I got there I realised that the turning circle was tiny anyway. </p> <p>Ego aside, does the hiring and hauling of a T@B improve the weekend in the country? Well it's an encumbrance (but not much of one) when you're dragging it, and somewhere between a tent and a B&amp;B room when you stay in it. There's no shower, and due to bad planning we ended up at caravan sites without one, so it was a washing-free weekend. I have no nostalgic memories of caravanning as a kid to draw pleasure from, so it may not be right for me, but judging from the admiration we met in the caravanning fraternity, it obviously is with many. </p> <p>Staff at Swiftsilver told me they've already got a few bookings for next year's Glastonbury festival, so what dry bate is tellin' me caravanning's not phat?</p> <p><strong>Factfile</strong></p> <p>Swiftsilver (01373 473073; <a href=\"http://www.swiftsilver.com\">swiftsilver.com</a>) offers T@B caravans for hire and sale.

  "<p>You come home from work to find that you have no clean clothes, the fridge is empty and your back aches from sitting at your desk all day. No problem, you pick up the phone, tell the person on the other end of the line your troubles, and within minutes your laundry has been collected, a massage has been booked and a three-course meal arrives on a silver tray. </p> <p>You don't have to be a hotel guest to enjoy this sort of high life any more. Quick to capitalise on the current insatiable desire for property investment, several market-leading hotel chains have started to incorporate independent homes into their city and resort developments. </p> <p>So, instead of just holidaying at a glamorous Four Seasons or Ritz-Carlton resort, you can buy one of their luxury apartments or villas outright. This means you get the best of both worlds - a second or permanent home, with access to all the facilities of a world-class hotel thrown in with the title deeds. It's what has become known as five-star living. </p> <p>'One of the attractions of owning a property in a development such as this is that they can piggyback the facilities on offer from the hotel,' says Richard Power, managing director of UK operations for the Forte Hotel Group, which is currently building its first resort with real estate in Sicily. 'For example, residents can use the golf courses and other leisure facilities, as well as having high-quality cleaning and maintenance services on tap. Plus they can have an arrangement with the hotelier to rent out the accommodation when they aren't using it, and they know everything will be properly looked after in their absence.' </p> <p>It's this combination of holiday-style living and investment potential that's attracting buyers to hotel properties. Premier Resorts has had huge interest from both foreign and local buyers in its current development, CampoReal, a Westin Hotel-backed golf and spa complex just north of Lisbon. The estate includes a championship golf course, health club, equestrian centre and five-star hotel. </p> <p>'It's all about guarantees,' says James Dawson of Premier Resorts. 'When you buy a property in a development like this, you also get the respectability of a hotel brand. All the properties are maintained as part of the resort to the high standards you would expect.' Such guarantees needn't cost the earth either. Launch prices of a furnished, two-bed apartment at CampoReal start at \u00a3195,000. </p> <p>At the first-class Four Seasons resort in Sharm El Sheikh, on Eqypt's Red Sea coast, with its tennis courts, private beach and lush gardens, a two-bedroom, exquisitely furnished chalet costs from\u00a3132,000. More extravagant villas with private pool, outdoor spa and views of the sea are also on offer, with prices starting at around \u00a3400,000. These are meant to be holiday homes, but there will be every temptation for owners to stay permanently. </p> <p>The concept hasn't yet found a foothold in the UK; only London's The Knightsbridge comes close. This development of luxury apartments opens next summer and will be the first to offer properties with the services of the Hyatt hotel group included in the purchase price of upwards of \u00a3500,000. </p> <p>'We wanted to offer first-class accommodation with the kind of service people would expect at a top hotel,' says The Knightsbridge's Kerry Simpson. 'Then we realised that a hotel company could do a better job.' Every resident will have an interview when they first move in so that the Hyatt management can tailor its service to suit their lifestyle, and extras such as daily cleaning, dog walking and the attentions of a concierge will be included in the yearly service charge. </p> <p>For full-on five-star living, however, nothing compares to Ritz-Carlton's new development on Grand Cayman's Seven Mile Beach, scheduled to open in November. The company already has a portfolio of prestigious, hotel-linked real estate stretching from New York to Berlin, but Grand Cayman is its crown jewel. Owners of the luxury residences, which cost from $2.9 million to a staggering $25m, will have their every desire taken care of. One of the pampering services included is a luxury car and a powerboat, complete with crew, available for the duration of your visit. In addition, you get two lifetime memberships to the resort's golf course and use of the on-site La Prairie spa, tennis courts and watersports. Hotel management will also take care of any routine maintenance in your absence, plus stock up the freezer, clean the house and make the beds ready for your return, if requested - though there is a charge for this. </p> <p>Developer Mike Ryan says: 'The idea is to provide all the services and amenities of a fully staffed, luxury private estate without the hassle and at a fraction of the expense homeowners would incur if they did it all themselves.' </p> <p>Living in a hotel means never having to do anything for yourself ever again. It's a no-fuss option for a new generation of property owners - and you even get to raid your own mini bar when you come home.</p>",
  "He called himself a man of little consequence. 'Mr Blair, I am nothing to you,' he said. Kenneth Bigley was too modest. The lurid coverage of his ordeal has repelled and gripped a nation following every twist of a story infused with hope but always likely to end tragically. Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the murderer of Mr Bigley's two American housemates, plays a short and and vile game. <p>The past week has seen a revolution in the history of fear. A Britain consumed by worry that terror was coming home imagined gas on the Tube, bombs at Heathrow or Beslan inside the beltway. Instead, the capture of a middle-aged engineer touched a bedrock of dread. Few visions are more horrible than helplessness. </p> <p>That impotence, his and ours, was exacerbated by the shrewdness of Mr Bigley's captors. Zarqawi, a small-time thug now tilting at a pan-Islamist caliphate, has advertised his animal tactics on the front pages. His website flashes are geared to the US lunchtime news, his murders pored over by voyeurs in dark corners of the internet, and his profits plumped up by snuff DVDs sold for a dollar each in Baghdad markets. Even the Bigley family's televised pleas for clemency underlined Zarqawi's leverage. </p> <p>There is a narrow line between the last resort of the despairing and an eBay of human life, in which escalating bids - first a brother, later a distraught mother - are posted for all to see. Intrusion makes a case, powerful but wrong, for the media to back off. In America, the beheading of Mr Bigley's friends received little coverage, partly because dead hostages are old news there, but also because of the instinct for suppression that, from the outset, offered too little challenge to George W Bush's war plans. </p> <p>Media restraint is hard to unravel from censorship and blackouts were rarely feasible, even before global networks. Since the Crucifixion, agony and death have been a public spectacle. Onlookers may be brutalised by terrible sights, but the greater danger lies in all the Calvaries we do not climb. The 12,800 Iraqi civilians killed since the war began are faceless, as are many of the soldiers killed in action. On the day Ken Bigley's video played in millions of British living rooms, 22 people were murdered in Baghdad. When history is a string of macabre Kodak moments, those slaughtered off-camera evaporate as if they had never lived. </p> <p>But in every conflict, one face encapsulates a war. It did not have to be Ken Bigley's, for there are many like him. A friend of my family, another ageing wanderer whose life had removed him from his roots, was blown up in Baghdad last month. He knew the risks and hoped to be lucky. Mr Bigley, working one last lucrative assignment before he quit, must have made a similar calculation. </p> <p>Instead, he became a condemned man holding a Prime Minister to account. Tony Blair, content to explain himself to God his maker over Iraq, had first to answer to Mr Bigley. 'Help me live,' the captive had asked, with a faith that resonated like an echo. Throughout the Iraq debacle, no citizen has ever placed such blind trust in Blair, bar Blair himself. And yet he could do nothing. </p> <p>There was no dilemma, since the state rightly debars negotiating with insurgents holding knives to throats. There was no hypocrisy, for those who complain that Mr Blair takes tea with terrorists are wrong. To call all such people irredeemable is to sketch a world in which the IRA, Baader-Meinhof and the Red Brigades still hold sway. If, on some tomorrow, Bush sits down with Zarqawi, that may be a mark of a retreat from mutually assured destruction. </p> <p>But, for now, Mr Blair has no decision to make. Of all the questions thrown up by Iraq, the case of Mr Bigley was the least taxing. Even the Prime Minister's personal anguish may be salved by his iron sense of rightness. Yet he is no more free of responsibility than hostages are victims of unmediated chance. The events of last week showed almost as little randomness as the opening scene of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead , in which the two characters toss a coin that always comes down heads. </p> <p>The current turmoil in Iraq was inevitable in a fissile country where order, for many years, has only been maintained by brutal tyrants. That does not render future democracy impossible, but it was never going to be imposed by a botched and illegal war. Mr Blair's disregard for advice, history and law helped usher in a nemesis compounded by errors ranging from disbanding the Iraqi security services to the brutishness of Abu Ghraib. Zarqawi, disgusting beyond words, is also the beneficiary of conditions in which the wicked thrive. </p> <p>So get the troops out now, some say, but running would be likely to herald another hardline Baathist overlord or civil meltdown. Defenders of the war eulogise Iraq, hotspots apart. But even assuming the three-quarters of the population cited by Donald Rumsfeld could stroll to the polls as peaceably as George Orwell's idealised old maids once cycled to church through the morning mist, limited elections would be impossible. The time for denial is over. Two Italian women aid workers are abducted and, maybe, murdered. Death is the only service with guaranteed delivery in Baghdad. </p> <p>So what now? As Paul Rogers, professor of peace studies at Bradford University, has argued, the US presidential election is likely to presage all-out assaults on Falluja and elsewhere, should Mr Bush get his second term and his second chance to bomb Iraq into secular democracy. </p> <p>In that context, it seems curious that Mr Blair's remark last week about 'a new Iraqi conflict' attracted so little exploration. If Iraq is 'the crucible in which the future of global terrorism is decided', that is because the actions of Bush and Blair have made it so. The question is what the Prime Minister plans to do now, beyond praying that elections work. Will he stand by the President if Mr Bush goes for Shock and Awe Mark Two or will he be bold enough to step aside? </p> <p>For now, it seems probable that more innocents will beg on grainy videos for help from politicians rendered powerless not only by the monstrosity of others, but through their own folly. Onlookers will stare again in sorrow and unease at the pain of strangers. Human impulses prompted good people of all faiths to yearn for Ken Bigley's freedom, but so did the awareness that we are all part of his story. </p> <p>As international affairs analyst Fred Halliday has said, universalism is dying. The US, post 9/11, has put hardline survivalism first and last. Islamic extremists move further towards medieval savagery. As the world converges on the edge of the abyss, the fate of individuals shows what may lie ahead if politicians cannot heed the warning signs. Kenneth Bigley, never a figure of little consequence, is the unwitting signalman on the road to hell. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:mary.riddell@observer.co.uk\">mary.riddell@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "The air was hot and the mosquitoes were biting as Tom Brown sweatily trudged from house to house on the leafy suburban street. An elderly woman opened her door and eagerly took a leaflet from the Republican campaigner. Her next words brought a grin to Brown's face. 'I was going to vote for you anyway,' she said, before adding: 'And I'm a Democrat, too.' <p>Brown is campaigning on the streets of Clay County, Missouri, one of the most crucial battlegrounds in the US elections. The message was loud and clear: President George Bush is winning in the swing states. </p> <p>That is a key development as the election enters its final stretch. Most of America is starkly divided into red and blue, but the swing states are the only place where the political palate is mixed. They are the places where the battle for the White House will be won or lost. They mainly stretch in an arc from the rust belt of Pennsylvania through Ohio and down into the Midwest. This is purple America, and nowhere is more purple than Clay County. </p> <p>In the 2000 election Al Gore won Clay County by a single vote, making it the narrowest victory in the United States. But things do not look so close this time around. Clay County's Republicans are openly confident of victory. In fact, Brown knows things cannot stay this good. 'It is going so good right now it's scary. That will change. There is no way Bush can maintain this level of support,' he said. </p> <p>All across the swing states, Bush has moved ahead as Republicans have begun to win the fierce ground war of the election. Republicans have taken leads in Pennsylvania and Ohio, which should have been firm Democratic territory. At the same time they have secured their own turf, taking double-digit leads in states like Nevada and Missouri. </p> <p>That is bad news for Democratic challenger John Kerry. Missouri is the most reliable bellwether state. It is a unique crossroads of American demographics: where north meets south and east meets west. Missouri has the same percentage of black Americans as the US as a whole, the same goes for union members, and its rural and urban mix is also a reflection of the national average. In all presidential elections but one since 1900 Missouri has backed the winning candidate. And at the moment Missouri is backing Bush. He has an 11-point lead. </p> <p>The reason is simple: the 'war on terror'. It is the centrepiece of the Bush campaign, and Clay County's Republicans are ruthlessly on-message. 'The biggest issue is keeping America safe. It is keeping our families safe,' said Kate Porter, an attorney who is the Republican county chairwoman. </p> <p>That echoes what the Bush campaign is saying nationally. The threat to America from terrorism has been used as the focus of the campaign. Bush's stump speech, repeated each day, pumps the terrorism theme relentlessly. Democrats have accused the Republicans of scaremongering, but the move has struck a chord. Even here, in the pretty county seat of Liberty, seemingly so far removed from any outside threat, fear of terrorist attack is rife. </p> <p>America's heartland is afraid. As Maggie Boyd, 66, sat in the picturesque town square she spoke of the recent school massacre in Russia as having a direct relevance to life in Clay County. 'You just don't know if someone is going to go into my grandson's high school and do that here,' she said. </p> <p>Boyd is voting for Bush. She sees the war in Iraq as an integral part of the 'war on terror'. For her, the pictures aired daily on TV news of bombs in Baghdad are part of the same fight that brought down the World Trade Centre. '11 September changed everything for me. Bush was right to go into Iraq,' she said. </p> <p>For Democrats, however, there is now relief that the war in Iraq has at last become an electoral issue. After weeks of damaging insults over Kerry and Bush's respective Vietnam records, America's political debate has finally tackled the real war that is happening today. Kerry has re-emerged as aggressive on the war. Last week he openly attacked Bush for creating the Iraqi mess. It is now Kerry's mission to win the election by slamming the Iraq war. It is no simple task. Bush has consistently held healthy poll leads over Kerry on issues of national security. But the new Democratic strategy mirrors the ploy used by Bush's campaign guru, Karl Rove: hit the candidates on their strengths, not their weaknesses. </p> <p>Certainly, anti-war opinion is out there. Both campaigns in Clay County admit that the war has polarised people like nothing else in a generation. Mike Springer, a local businessman, is not shy about his thoughts on Bush. 'I loathe him,' he said as he drew on a cigarette outside his office. 'I grew up in the Vietnam era. I see a lot of the same stuff as then. The lies, and you see all these boys coming home with no arms, no legs,' he said. </p> <p>There is deep anger about the war in the swing states and on the streets of Clay County. Phil Willoughby is a local Democratic candidate. His father, a lifelong Republican and a Korean War veteran, is now about to vote Democrat for the first time in his long life. 'He feels like he is being sold out. He thinks his President lied to him,' Willoughby said. </p> <p>But the Republicans are not just a one-trick pony, hammering away on terrorism. They have amassed a formidable campaign machine that outguns and outspends the Democrats in most states. They have been organised in Missouri far longer than the Democrats, and have more staff. The Democrats are relying on outside campaigning organisations, like America Coming Together, to do much of the crucial legwork of voter registration. </p> <p>Republicans have also fine-tuned their campaign to play on local issues. Much of the swing state battlefield is rural or semi-rural. Clay County is typical. At one end it bleeds into the metropolis of Kansas City and at the other is farmland and small towns. </p> <p>These are the 'exurbs': the new political front line. Religious and moral issues play big here, and Bush's folksy style and religious rhetoric go down well. Kerry's liberal north-eastern manners do not. </p> <p>'I believe Bush is a Christian man and that pleases me. It is not fashionable these days to say you are being led by a higher power,' said Boyd. </p> <p>Much has been made of gay marriage, which Bush has pledged to make a constitutional issue. The swing states, even where they are Democratic, are often conservative in their social values. Clay County is no exception. Republicans in Missouri organised a ballot in August on banning gay marriage in the state. It passed overwhelmingly, galvanising the local Republican party. 'Since we got them out to vote once, it is easier to get them out to vote again,' said Porter. 'There are still some Democrats we haven't run out of Clay County. But we are working on it.' </p> <p>Willoughby believes the Democrats can still win. 'Missouri is still a swing state. We are more mobilised in Clay County than we have been in a generation. It is still early. We have six weeks left,' he said. </p> <p>That is true. As the election moves into its final stages, many voters are starting to pay attention for the first time. Messages that took months to deliver earlier in the year can now be got across in just days as every newspaper and television station is full of election coverage. With the crucial presidential debates about to start, Kerry can still turn around the swing state battle. </p> <p>But the backdrop is still one of fear and terrorism. No one is immune. Margene Thorpe, doing a volunteer shift in the Liberty local museum, voiced her fears. 'We wish we could go back to where we do not have to be so afraid. But that will never happen again.' She, too, is voting for Bush. Her husband, Derle, sat beside her and echoed her thoughts. 'Freedom is not free,' he said. 'It has high costs.' </p> <p>If the Democrats' new strategy of making the election a referendum on Iraq is to succeed, then the Thorpes' fear and support of the Iraq war as part of the 'war on terror' will have to be overcome. It will not be easy. 'How do you tell someone not to be afraid of terrorism?' Willoughby asked. 'We are all afraid of terrorism.'</p>",
  "<p>With little more than five weeks before America goes to the polls, the US media is experiencing the bitter effects of an acutely divided country. At no time in the past has the media, and especially the news media, drawn such anger for perceptions of bias, and at no time has the media been so sensitive to those accusations. </p> <p>If the US media industry could once rise above the partisan divide, it has now fallen or been pulled into the thick of the struggle. The degree to which the media is now politicised beyond its control was shown by the recent controversy at CBS News. Dan Rather, heir to Walter Cronkite and the seemingly unimpeachable voice of reason, took the full force of the storm. The fake documents may have spoken the truth on George Bush's war record, but that point was lost. </p> <p>In presenting a false report, CBS had seemingly exposed its own bias and was easy to vilify. On both sides of the political divide, the media is now seen as the key battleground. The extent to which both sides perceive that the media is biased against them speaks not to any bias itself, but to how important the media has become to political life. </p> <p>'If you don't win the media battle, you don't win,' says Vanity Fair media columnist Michael Wolff. 'What's happened is that the media is the entire game. There is no political life outside of the media. Political consensus is created in the media, political careers are created in the media, and campaigns are won and lost in the media.' </p> <p>Political campaigns grow ever more sophisticated in how to use the media, and the media itself has been overwhelmed by the speed and momentum of the spin it is now subjected to. While Republicans complain about an innate liberal media bias, and Democrats see an outrageous pro-administration bias at Fox News and elsewhere, others believe that inherent weaknesses, coupled with advances in technology, have rendered the media powerless to cope. </p> <p>The Columbia Journalism Review recently published an editorial saying it had found that 'in the modern media bubble, where technological advances have reporters on what amounts to a constant deadline, processing a never-ending torrent of digital spin, it's often debatable who is actually framing the stories - the journalist or the campaigns.' </p> <p>'The main problem is that the media has been overwhelmed by spin,' says executive editor Michael Hoyt. </p> <p>Others believe that market forces have forced the press to adopt more opinionated positions because that's what people want. A recent Pew research poll found that 43 per cent who pay close attention to the news prefer news that suits their point of view. </p> <p>At a dinner last week, Rupert Murdoch said that had the CBS debacle been Fox's 'we would have been crucified'. He acknowledged that 'the traditional media is against us' and accused it of being 'in tune with the elite, not the people'. </p> <p>Brent Cunningham, managing editor of Columbia Journalism Review, does not believe the US is necessarily entering an age of partisan media. Instead, he says, 'the mainstream press has been manipulated by both sides - the Bush and Kerry camps - and both have exploited the weakness of this \"he said/she said\" journalism'. He says the US press is too beholden to official sources, and has become essentially passive and content to lean on someone else's version of the truth instead of assembling its own, more complete version. </p> <p>'The press seems like it's partisan, but it's not... it's just weak-kneed,' Cunningham adds. 'When you have political candidates and operatives who are willing to say whatever is politically expedient because they know it'll get uncritical play before the press rushes on to something else, it starts to read like partisan coverage.' </p> <p>The Swift boat story is a prime example. With no strong and immediate come-back to Republican accusations that John Kerry had not served valiantly in Vietnam, he lost the debate. But, says Cunningham, 'the press did nothing to challenge that infinitely challengeable claim. It is not comfortable injecting issues into the public discourse that are not put out there by some official source, so if the Kerry camp doesn't do a good job defending itself the press doesn't feel any obligation to point out what's inaccurate.' </p> <p>If that's true, the last few weeks of this election will be as fascinating as they are unnerving. Democrats believe that any story not favourable to John Kerry must be the work of Bush's Dr Evil, Karl Rove; Republicans that Bill Clinton and James Carville must be behind any strategic success Kerry achieves. </p> <p>With a computer and an internet connection anyone can have a media opinion. Bloggers and internet insta-pundits consistently beat the more traditional news media to the spin. The sense that this election is a charade fought through dissipated mediums is unavoidable. The Republicans, having long felt disadvantaged by a liberal-leaning press, know how to transmit their message below the radar of the mainstream media, academia and Hollywood, and are far better at spinning the media. </p> <p>As many are now predicting, the coming mediated debates between Kerry and Bush may be the deciding factor. But the institutionalised failure of the press to protect itself from becoming helplessly politicised is unlikely to get better until it recovers the will to challenge officialdom. </p> <p>In small measure there may be a change afoot. The New York Times recently started publishing a facts box that seeks to elevate political debate with... facts. </p> <p>'It's as if the press has been in retreat ever since 9/11,' says Cunningham. 'It has stiffened up in spots, but it has not been able to set or influence the agenda. And without that ability, all you have is spin.'</p>",
  "<p>George Bush and Gordon Brown are heading for a dramatic showdown at the G7 summit in Washington this week over plans to write off developing countries' debt.</p> <p>The American president, desperate for policies to emphasise his 'caring conservative' credentials before November's presidential election, is advancing a plan to cancel billions of dollars in debt owed by some of the world's poorest countries. </p> <p>The plan, disclosed by members of aid groups, would increase previous debt relief programmes for at least 27 poor nations such as Uganda, Bolivia, and Ethiopia. The US Treasury Department, which is putting the plan forward, says the current approach has been too slow and piecemeal to free developing countries from the burden of repaying money borrowed from the World Bank, International Monetary Fund and other global lenders. </p> <p>The US Treasury is also proposing that, for very poor countries, all future IMF and World Bank assistance come in the form of grants rather than loans. </p> <p>But Brown is strongly against the plans because it would mean debt cancellation paid out of World Bank and IMF funds. This would mean the World Bank, in particular, would have less scope for poverty alleviation. </p> <p>Brown's plan, to be outlined tonight at a Trade Justice Movement fringe meeting in Brighton tonight, is for all G7 countries to put up extra funds directly for debt cancellation. He is prepared for the UK to contribute an extra \u00a3100 million every year.</p> <p>A UK Treasury spokesman was worried that Bush's proposals 'would rob Peter to pay Paul'. He added: 'We want to see [Brown's plan] happen. What we need to be clear about is that it needs to be fully financed.'</p> <p>The rival plans will be decided by other G7 nations. Canada is expected to back Brown's plan. France is thought also to be sympathetic. Germany is not in a position to put extra money on the table because of its fiscal situation. Japan and Italy are thought to be undecided.</p> <p>Campaigners are divided over which plan to back. Some are delighted that Brown is promising extra cash for debt cancellation, but others believe that Bush's plan could have greater impact, particularly if other countries fail to follow Britain's lead. </p> <p>Peter Hardstaff, head of policy at the World Development Movement, said: 'Whatever plan gets accepted, we are concerned about the conditions attached to any debt cancellation, which could see poor countries forced to privatise and deregulate their markets.'</p>"
