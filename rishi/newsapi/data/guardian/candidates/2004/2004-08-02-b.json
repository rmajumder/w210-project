  "<p>Another day, another win: the way the game is scheduled these days success is coming so thick and fast that one victory seems to blend into another. We will be getting blas\u00e9 next. </p> <p>But the England cricket team, once every stand-up comic's metaphor for abject failure - occasionally justifiably - really is surfing the big one at the moment. </p> <p>Not without reason are Michael Vaughan's side ranked second best in the world, behind Australia and closing the gap. The next 13 months, during which England go to South Africa and Australia go to India and then next summer to England for the Ashes series, will answer a lot of questions. Nothing is quite so clear-cut any more. </p> <p>Vaughan and his side are on a roll the like of which has not been seen from an England side since the mid-1970s, when Kerry Packer stole the jewels from many national crowns. For a period of 33 matches then, following immediately the drubbing by West Indies in 1976, England, under Tony Greig initially and then Mike Brearley, won 18 matches and lost only four: to India, Australia twice and New Zealand. </p> <p>The current team have won 15 of 22 matches since they lost to Australia in Melbourne the Christmas before last, losing only to South Africa twice and Sri Lanka. Furthermore there have been eight wins in the last nine matches without defeat and, of course, five in a row this summer. </p> <p>They have some way to go before matching the remarkable achievement of Steve Waugh's Australians, in winning 16 straight Tests, or even the 11 in a row attained by the marauding West Indians under Clive Lloyd. Two other teams, Sri Lanka and South Africa, have managed nine straight wins. </p> <p>The best by England is seven, first by Arthur Shrewsbury, Walter Read and Allan Steel between 1884-5 and 1887-8 and again by Percy Chapman between 1928 and the end of the following winter. </p> <p>Given a fair wind, Vaughan (and Marcus Trescothick, of course, who captained in the first match of the summer to set off the sequence) will equal that by the end of this series. </p> <p>It was a year ago last Wednesday that an emotional Nasser Hussain relinquished the captaincy he so valued and handed it on to Vaughan. With the series against South Africa midstream, it seemed a hospital pass at the time and under the circumstances no one could reasonably have foreseen the manner in which the side has blossomed since. </p> <p>In the process Vaughan, determined but understated when compared with his predecessor, has remarkably, for the time being anyway, become the second most successful captain in the history of the game, of those who have led their country more than a dozen times. </p> <p>Way out ahead is Waugh, who won 71.9% of matches in which he led Australia. But Vaughan has won 11 of 17 games - 64.71% - better than any other England captain. (WG Grace with 61.54%, Douglas Jardine with 60%, followed by Brearley and Chapman's 58.06% and 52.94% respectively, are closest.) It is better, too, than Don Bradman with his \"Invincibles\" (62.5%) and Clive Lloyd (48.65%) and Viv Richards (54%) with the all-conquering West Indies. </p> <p>In fact the record of recent England captains is an illustration of how the side has grown up: Graham Gooch managed 29.41%, Mike Atherton 24.07%, Alec Stewart 26.67% and Hussain 37.78%. Vaughan is reaping the dividends of the hard work that went in to create the environment for his players to flourish. </p> <p>But there is a glaring anomaly. Brearley's figures might be distorted by the fact that he never led England against West Indies, the best side in the world at the time, as Vaughan has yet to be tested against the Australians. We will have more idea after next summer as to his real worth, although his strategic good sense seems to be coming on apace with the performances of his players. </p> <p>As it stands, though, it is hard to assess the relative strengths of the two sides. More England players - Vaughan himself, Andy Flintoff, Graham Thorpe and Steve Harmison - would get into the Australian side than a year ago, when Vaughan alone would have made the cut. </p> <p>A year hence, fitness allowing, the England bowling attack will be significantly better: more experienced, fitter, greater in depth. That of Australia will be a year older, which is not the same thing. Glenn McGrath is scarcely the force he was, Jason Gillespie is brilliant but physically fragile and Brett Lee was panned all over the park by the Indian batsmen last winter. England play spin better now than two years ago. </p> <p>Australia's batting will be formidable, but then so, when the confidence is flowing, is England's. </p> <p>But, when McGrath feels the need to start his pathetic war of words this early (only 3-0 because the weather is bound to interfere, he says), one has to wonder if the Australians are not just a bit concerned that the wheel is turning perceptibly. This is going to be a mighty year. </p> <p><strong> Current world Test ratings </strong></p> <p><strong>1</strong> Australia 129 </p> <p><strong> 2</strong> <strong> England</strong> 107 </p> <p><strong> 3</strong> South Africa 106 </p> <p><strong> 4</strong> Pakistan 105 </p> <p><strong> 5</strong> India 104 </p> <p><strong> 6</strong> Sri Lanka 99 </p> <p><strong> 7</strong> New Zealand 94 </p> <p><strong> 8</strong> West Indies 76 </p> <p><strong> 9</strong> Zimbabwe 51 </p> <p><strong> 10</strong> Bangladesh 1 </p> <p><strong> The leading England Test captains</strong> </p> <p><strong> Michael Vaughan</strong> </p> <p>Matches 17, wins 11, win%64.71 </p> <p> <strong> WG Grace</strong> </p> <p> Matches 13, wins 8, win%61.54 </p> <p> <strong> Douglas Jardine</strong> </p> <p> Matches 15, wins 9, win%60 </p> <p> <strong> Mike Brearley</strong> </p> <p> Matches 31, wins 18, win%58.06 </p> <p> <strong> Percy Chapman</strong> </p> <p> Matches 17, wins 9, win% 52.94</p>",
  "<b>\u00b7</b> It would take a hard heart not to feel for Dick Cheney. The problem with being hired as the guy who'll make George Bush look good by comparison is that when the president's in a tight spot, you have to sink to quite a level to deflect attention. And so, with Bush hit by the so-called Kerry bounce after last week's Democratic convention, it fell to Dick to pull something pretty special out of the bag on his visit to a campaign rally in Arizona on Saturday. But the vice-president's nothing if not a closer. Preparing to cover the event, the Arizona Daily Star submitted its photographer's name and credentials in the usual manner, but were amazed on Friday to receive a call from the White House asking the paper to disclose the journalist's race. Having never heard such a request in her 26-year career, managing editor Teri Hayt refused to divulge the information and asked if the photographer - Mamta Popat - had been singled out for racial profiling because of her name. Cheeringly, a Republican campaign spokesman declined to elaborate, so we'll have to leave this everyday story of homeland security folk here. <p><b>\u00b7</b> Just when we were starting to enjoy the FA personnel haemorrhage - it's like one of those movies where the entire royal family gets wiped out, leaving Jim Carrey as the closest heir - the smile is wiped off our stupid lowbrow faces. One man, we recall in horror, has long been rumoured to be interested in the top job at Soho Square, so can it be long before Alastair Campbell's name finds its way on to a list of runners and riders to replace long-faced former chief executive Mark Palios? Admittedly, Alastair's a slightly more savvy media operator than erstwhile communications director Colin Gibson - although on the basis of the latter's News of the World fiasco, so is Sooty. But unless the whole episode has been some elaborate FA plot to test the credulity of the nation (certainly possible), this conclusion to it would seem ill-advised. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Speaking of assaults on the national psyche, we shall finally reveal our plans for Noel Edmonds tomorrow. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Many thanks, meanwhile, for all your suggestions as to which Guardian staff could be masons. Unfortunately, we're still in the dark as to whether any of the myriad people in the building with the power to fire us might be compromised by such speculation, so Shop A Guardian Mason remains tantalisingly on hold for now. We are, however, most aggrieved to discover that being female rules us out of joining the organisation for personal gain, and will be proposing a replacement campaign - Let's Make Corruption Equal Opportunities - in a call to the Grand Lodge later today. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> We're grateful to Channel 4 News for broadcasting Craig Unger's visit to an event celebrating Saudi culture last Saturday, which took an amusing turn when the Saudi ambassador, Prince Turki al-Faisal, approached the House of Bush, House of Saud author for a chat. The pair exchanged a few pleasantries at the Syon Park venue, before the ambassador suggested that, had Craig actually visited Saudi Arabia, he wouldn't have written his book. A visit would have been lovely, agreed Craig with studied politeness, but unfortunately the Saudi government had turned down his request for a visa. A short pause, then back to the studio. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> There are further developments, finally, in the tale of Islamophobe Sunday Telegraph columnist Will Cummins and British Council press officer Harry Cummins, who a Diary source alleges to be one and the same person. Harry - who denies being Will - has been suspended on full pay, we are told by communications chief Christopher Wade, while the British Council investigates the claims. As for Will, he did not appear in the Sunday Telegraph this weekend, but we trust he enjoyed the sunshine.</p>",
  "America's department of homeland security has often been accused of crying wolf for raising the alert after overhearing \"chatter\" on the terrorist grapevine. <p>This time, however, the US authorities really believe they have caught a rare glimpse of the wolf at work - an al-Qaida operation in preparation. </p> <p>The high alert sounded at financial institutions in New York, New Jersey or Washington was the most specific to date, and it marks the first time this year that the colour-coded alert status has been raised to orange (high). </p> <p>It is also the first time that the homeland security department has named specific buildings as possible al-Qaida targets. </p> <p>The warning is based on the blueprint of a proposed operation found on an al-Qaida computer belonging to Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani, a Tanzanian-born terrorist suspect arrested in Pakistan last week. </p> <p>Even more important is the evidence provided by the al-Qaida computer expert and web manager, Muhammad Naeem Noor Khan, who led investigators to Mr Ghailani. </p> <p>The computer files pointed to an extensive and meticulous plan to attack a financial target, such as the World Bank, the Citigroup headquarters in New York, or the Prudential Financial building in Newark. </p> <p>Al-Qaida operatives had clearly scouted out those buildings, gaining access to upper floors by posing as couriers and delivery men. Ways in and out had been mapped, and the number of potential casualties assessed. </p> <p>\"It is a treasure trove,\" a US intelligence official said yesterday. \"It provides an incredible level of detail regarding potential targets.\" </p> <p>However, there were no clues about the timing of the attacks. Workers at the buildings mentioned on the al-Qaida files were told to go to work as normal, with instructions only to be concerned. </p> <p>Tom Ridge, the US homeland security secretary, suggested that for \"the workers going to work today, there are very anxious moments\". </p> <p>Meanwhile, one tunnel leading into New York was closed to lorries, while police in New York, Newark and Washington were supposed to be stopping cars and lorries near the would-be targets, questioning drivers, and in some cases searching vehicles. </p> <p>Critics of the measures argued they did more to raise anxiety than to provide real security against attack. Larry Thompson, a former CIA and state department counter-terrorist official, accused the administration of perpetuating \"a cry wolf phenomenon\". </p> <p>He added: \"You're showing the terrorists that if they make enough of a specific threat, they can shut down a city.\" </p> <p>Howard Dean, a former Vermont governor and outspoken Democrat, suggested that the alert was a political ploy by the Bush administration. </p> <p>\"I am concerned that every time something happens that's not good for President Bush he plays his trump card, which is terrorism,\" he told CNN. \"It is just impossible to know how much of this is real and how much of this is politics.\" </p> <p>However, John Kerry, the Democratic party presidential candidate, who was briefed on his campaign bus, disowned Mr Dean's remarks, saying: \"I believe you take these threats seriously. I think people of good conscience are working on these issues.\" </p> <p>Given the specificity of the al-Qaida plans uncovered in Pakistan, there was never any question that an alert would be raised. US intelligence has just emerged from a televised grilling for its failure to spot the warning signs of the September 11 attack. It is not about to repeat the mistake.</p>",
  "The US president, George Bush, said tonight that he would ask Congress to create a post for an intelligence adviser and a national counter-terrorism centre, as called for by the Senate report into the September 11 attacks. <p>Speaking at the White House, Mr Bush announced his administration's first major policy revamp since last month's recommendations from the 9/11 committee - an inquiry which convened after initial resistance by the president. </p> <p>Mr Bush has decided to embrace, with some changes, the two main recommendations from the commission's 567-page report that outlined lapses in intelligence that left America vulnerable to the 2001 attacks. </p> <p>The new intelligence chief will oversee the main security agencies, including the CIA and the department of homeland security. The appointee will be the president's main intelligence adviser, responsible for daily briefings, which are currently the responsibility of the CIA director, Mr Bush said. </p> <p>Mr Bush's announcements came as warnings of a specific and detailed bomb threat from al-Qaida prompted increased security around five prominent financial institutions in New York, Washington DC and New Jersey. </p> <p>\"We are a nation in danger,\" Mr Bush said in the Rose Garden. \"The work of security in this vast nation is not done,\" Mr Bush said. \"The elevation of the threat level in New York, New Jersey and Washington DC is a serious reminder - a solemn reminder - of the threat we continue to face.\" The Senate 9/11 committee envisioned a national terror centre as a joint operational planning and intelligence centre staffed by personnel from all the spy agencies. </p> <p>The commission's chairman, Republican Thomas Kean, had insisted that the centre and the national intelligence director be placed in the executive office of the president to give them White House clout in dealing with intelligence agencies. </p> <p>However, Mr Bush said he wanted them set up outside the White House. \"I don't think the person should be a member of my cabinet,\" he said. \"I will hire the person and I can fire the person ... I don't think that the office should be in the White House. I think it should be a stand-alone group to better coordinate.\" </p>",
  "The latest US polls found that Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry has managed what few before him have done: he walked away from four days of party cheerleading in Boston without creating a post-convention \"bounce\" of public support. <p>A <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/content/?ci=12565\">CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll</a> concluded that not only had Mr Kerry's campaign not benefited from the party's national conference, but the president, George Bush, had actually gained ground. Among likely voters, Mr Bush led Mr Kerry by 50% to 46%, compared to a pre-convention poll where Mr Kerry led 47% to 46%. Independent candidate Ralph Nader held fairly steady at 2%. </p> <p>Registered voters favoured Mr Kerry over Mr Bush 50% to 47%, a slight change from his 49% to 45% lead in a similar poll two weeks ago. However, with a margin of error of 3.5%, that effectively indicated a dead heat. </p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5568072/site/newsweek/\">Newsweek poll</a> also released yesterday recorded a four-point bounce for Mr Kerry on the strength of his performance in Boston, but that is the smallest ever climb in a Newsweek poll following a convention speech by a presidential challenger.</p> <p>Newsweek gave Mr Kerry 49% to Mr Bush's 42%, with Mr Nader on 3%. </p> <p>Mr Kerry's bounceless convention could be interpreted a sign of strength, his campaign argued, as he went into the convention more or less tied with Mr Bush, while most challengers facing an incumbent go into a convention 15 points down. </p> <p>Newsweek found that voters are deadlocked at 46% over who they would trust more to handle the situation in Iraq. In March, Mr Bush had a 15-point lead. </p> <p>The 1,010 adults polled gave Mr Bush a 48% to 43% advantage over Mr Kerry when it came to handling the terror threat. However, Mr Kerry had a higher rating as someone who can be trusted \"to make the right decisions during an international crisis\", leading 53% to 48%. </p> <p>Mr Bush's approval rating continued to slip, with just 45% approving of the job he is doing, and 49% disapproving. 58% of those polled were dissatisfied with the direction in which the US is heading. </p> <p>In an interview with Newsweek, the editor in chief of Gallup polls, Frank Newport, said the race was still too close to call and that the effect of the Democratic convention and the upcoming Republican convention in New York this month would not be clear until September. </p> <p>\"Based on all of our intensive Gallup poll analysis in the past, those incumbents who have breezed on to re-election since 1950 all were considerably ahead of where Bush is at this point. </p> <p>\"On the other hand, Bush is not as badly off as the last two incumbents who lost: Bush the elder and [Jimmy] Carter. Bush's father had a 29% job approval rating [in] July of 1992. Bush's is 49, so he's clearly not in as dire straits as his father was. But it's unclear whether Kerry can take advantage of that vulnerability and win,\" Mr Newport said.</p>",
  "<p>Warnings of a specific and detailed bomb threat from al-Qaida terrorists prompted increased security measures today around five prominent financial institutions in New York, Washington DC and New Jersey. </p> <p>The US secretary for homeland security, Tom Ridge, had warned that intelligence sources had uncovered a plot involving car or truck bombs directed at the Citigroup Centre building in New York and the New York Stock Exchange, the International Monetary Fund and World Bank buildings in Washington and Prudential Financial's headquarters in Newark, New Jersey. </p> <p>As Americans today read details of the plan to attack the country's economic heartland, their president, George Bush, said the warning came as \"a solemn reminder of the threat we continue to face\". </p> <p>Mr Ridge said the intelligence did not offer an idea of the timing of any possible attack, but a cache of recently obtained information, including photos, drawings and written documents, indicated that al-Qaida operatives had undertaken meticulous preparations to case the five buildings. </p> <p>\"The quality of this intelligence - based on multiple reporting streams, in multiple locations - is rarely seen, and it is alarming in both the amount and specificity of the information,\" Mr Ridge said at a hastily arranged news conference yesterday. </p> <p>Mr Ridge refused to reveal the sources of the intelligence, but acknowledged the warning was a result of international cooperation and specifically thanked Pakistan. </p> <p>The Pakistani information minister, Sheikh Rashid Ahmed, said today his country's agents had discovered plans to attack the US and UK on a computer seized during the arrest of a suspected senior al-Qaida operative. Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani, a Tanzanian arrested on July 25 after a 12-hour gun battle in the eastern city of Gujrat, was wanted in connection with the 1998 bombings of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. </p> <p>A senior US intelligence official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the intelligence gathered from several sources indicated that terrorists had carefully observed security in and around the buildings. They had identified the best places for reconnaissance, worked out how to make contact with employees who work in the buildings, researched traffic patterns and noted the locations of hospitals and police departments. </p> <p>The official said he had not seen such extraordinary detail in his 24 years in intelligence work. He cited as an example a midweek pedestrian traffic count.</p> <p>Mr Ridge raised the terror threat level for financial institutions in Washington and Newark to orange, or high alert, the second highest level on the government's five-point spectrum. New York was already at orange. Elsewhere, he said, the alert would remain at yellow, or elevated. </p> <p>Following the US warnings, the British Home Office said it continued to monitor the \"real and serious\" threat from terrorism, but did not warn of any specific risk. </p> <p>\"We do not discuss the threat level. If a specific threat arose we would inform the public,\" a Home Office spokesman said. </p> <p>Mr Ridge acknowledged that in the aftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks the government had changed the threat level \"about a half a dozen times\". He said that he knew generalised warnings alarmed the public and imposed a public cost in extra security, but that the specific nature of these plans made it possible to raise the threat level only for the financial institutions.</p> <p>Some in the US have criticised the government for seeking political advantage with vague terror threats. The latest warning came just days after the end of the Democratic national convention, which gave George Bush's rival in the presidential race, John Kerry, a particularly high profile in news reports. </p> <p>However, the New York Times reported that many Democrats appeared to take yesterday's threat seriously. </p> <p>Briefing reporters in New York, police commissioner Raymond Kelly said that, starting today, trucks would be banned from the Manhattan-bound side of the Williamsburg Bridge, which connects Brooklyn and lower Manhattan. Among other measures, commercial vehicles were banned from using the Holland tunnel to travel into the city from New Jersey. </p> <p>In Newark, police set up metal fences surrounding the Prudential Plaza building, blocked off two city streets and patrolled the area with assault rifles. </p> <p>Washington's mayor, Anthony Williams, put the entire city on an orange alert, although the homeland security department has not officially raised the threat level outside financial sector buildings. The city's police chief, Charles Ramsey, said teams of bomb-sniffing dogs would sweep areas around the World Bank and IMF headquarters and officers would conduct more traffic stops of large vehicles in the area. </p> <p>Officials have warned that the al-Qaida network may launch a large-scale assault in the hope of disrupting the November 2 presidential election and demonstrating that it remains capable of offensive actions despite international efforts to combat terrorism. </p> <p>The stock exchange and the Washington institutions were to open for business today, as was Prudential, with employees expected to report to work. Officials in New York, New Jersey and Washington encouraged people to continue their normal activities but remain vigilant.</p> <p>Mr Bush announced today that he would implement many of the intelligence reforms recommended by a national inquiry into the September 11 attacks. He said he would create the post of national intelligence director and a dedicated counter terrorism centre called for in the September 11 commission's report.</p>",
  "<p>The president of the Royal College of Physicians (RCP) has denied saying there are \"too many\" women doctors.</p> <p>Professor Carol Black today distanced herself from the front page headline in the Independent which ran over an interview in which she discussed the increasing number of women entering medicine. </p> <p>The headline - The medical timebomb: 'too many women doctors' - sparked controversy, especially coming from one of the most senior women figures in the NHS. Prof Black is also only the second woman to hold the royal college presidency in its 500-year history. </p> <p>But asked this afternoon if she was saying there were too many women in the profession, Prof Black told SocietyGuardian.co.uk: \"No of course I'm not. I'm saying we are a profession of women. That's a fact, it's been going on for several years.\"</p> <p>Prof Black also distanced herself from the suggestion that the increasing proportion of women doctors would result in the profession losing status. She stood by comments in the Independent that in Russia, where medicine was an almost entirely female profession, doctors had \"lost influence as a body\" - as had teachers in Britain - but said she was unsure how this had happened.</p> <p>\"If you look at the profession in Russia, that's a reality ... in other professions that appears in a superficial glance to be what's happened. Why I don't know.\" The RCP was carrying out some research into the issue this autumn, she added.</p> <p>Between 55% and 60% of all medical school graduates were now women, Prof Black said, while the figure at three schools topped 70%.</p> <p>Although the majority of student and newly qualified doctors were now women, they were still largely being channelled into a limited number of specialties. Areas such as cardiology were still dominated by men, she said.</p> <p>\"In order to have enough women in every branch of medicine we're going to have to change some structures to make sure people choose [their specialism] freely.\"</p> <p>Prof Black said it was important to look at the issue now because of the impact the changing gender balance of doctors could have in the future. She suggested that because women were seeking specialties that allowed more flexible or family-friendly working, there could be problems ensuring 24-hour services or sufficient doctors in specialties with long hours in future.</p> <p>She said there was a need for more flexible working opportunities and support, such as mentoring, to support women doctors</p> <p>Professor Black refused to say categorically whether she thought a shortage in specialties such as cardiology was a possibility.</p> <p>Liz Hewett, executive director for service delivery at the Royal College of Nursing, said: \"We do not accept the assertion that the feminisation of a workforce automatically leads to a loss of power, status and influence. </p> <p>\"Nursing provides a great example of a predominately female workforce that has taken on new and innovative roles, often working as equals with doctors and other healthcare professionals and pioneering new ways of practice. </p> <p>\"However we do strongly support Professor Black's comment that traditional structures and working patterns are inadequate and do not reflect the needs of working women in today's society,\" she said.</p>",

A survey by recruitment consultants Office Angels has found that two-thirds of office workers would like to work abroad. Unfortunately, just 8% of those questioned can speak a foreign language at even a basic level. The other 92% presumably rely on the tried and tested method of moving as one giant British pack and speaking to the foreigners they need to provide them with the necessary beer and lard repasts VERY LOUDLY and V-E-R-Y S-L-O-W-L-Y. </p> <p>Meanwhile, employers are insisting that a second language is the make-or-break factor in hiring a new recruit. The top five languages which will currently cause interviewers to fall on your CV like Prince Harry on a comely maiden are: French, Spanish, Japanese, Italian and Chinese. But just 49% of workers know how to say \"How are you?\" in French (\"Comment \u00e7a va?\" for those of you who wish to blag your next survey, if not your next interview), only 33% could ask for the bill in Spanish (\"La cuenta, por favor\"), and a meagre 9% could count above 20 in any language. A further fifth thought \"Quelle heure est-il?\" meant \"What day is it?\" when clearly it means \"Whose prostitute is this?\" </p> <p>Eight out of 10 people questioned reckoned they could get by at work without speaking another language because \"everyone speaks English\" and 90% admitted to letting what little language knowledge they once had (courtesy of enforced GCSE travails) lapse.

Relax. Just in time, UK ISP Tiscali has brought out a survey which proves that UK women are not - I repeat, not - a clutch of Stepford Wives. They loathe housework and would hire help in a heartbeat if funds permitted, especially to relieve them of ironing and cooking duties. When you've finished reeling backwards in shock, the survey did reveal some slightly more puzzling figures. When asked which wives they most admired, 19% of the 1,300 women polled said Kerry McFadden, 15% said the lovely Jennifer Aniston and 12% said Jules Oliver.

  "<p>Once I was a cabinet minister. But as I enter my 70s, I find it hard to accept no one is interested in me any more. So I've decided to publish a risque diary to indulge my attention-seeking behaviour. </p> <p>The idea of a journal began when my wife and I booked a cruise of the Norwegian fjords. It had been a while since I danced and it occurred to me I had better practise if I wasn't to embarrass myself on the ship. In the Yellow Pages, I discovered someone called Mr Wonderful was running tea-dancing sessions in a place called Wandsworth. </p> <p>I checked the map and found Wandsworth was some far-off suburb of London. I motored up from our Cornish estate, stayed overnight at my Chelsea pied-a-terre and took a bus in the direction of Mr Wonderful. The journey was remarkable because there were some funny black people on board speaking in an accent I couldn't decipher. How England has changed. </p> <p>The dancing was held in an old bingo hall and offered me the perfect opportunity to patronise and insult the lower middle-classes. I also managed to patronise Mr Wonderful, who turned out to be an Indian fellow and didn't recognise me. How my wife and I chuckled about the day's events later. </p> <p>My adventures had given me a taste for travel and I found myself in a place called Tooting. I don't know why so many British people are so keen on going abroad: travelling to Tooting was just like being in south-east Asia, as there were so many Indians, Pakistanis and Bangladeshis on the streets. </p> <p>You might like to know that my member is still fully functional. I went to the doctor to request some Viagra and he told me in no uncertain manner I had no need of it. Still, with my priapism stirred, I decided to make a tour of London's underwear emporia. Some of the items on sale are shocking and I was happy to buy some lacy thongs from Agent Provocateur. I also dropped into Bradley's and saw the sort of negligee a Saudi prince might give his mistress. </p> <p>I entered an establishment called Spearmint Rhino and a charming filly danced naked for me. I engaged her in conversation and found her to be highly intelligent and, if I'm not mistaken, not unattracted to me. </p> <p>Mr Wonderful was advertising another dance in Bromley, so my perambulations took me there, where I encountered many more foreigners. Returning home, I found London full of men and women in tweeds. How splendid to see so many white faces on the countryside march. Blair's phoney multi-culturalism is destroying this once great land. </p> <p>The day of the cruise came and we arrived to find there was to be no dancing on board. Bless my soul. I must confess, I found the other passengers somewhat dull. Bring back national service. </p> <p><strong>The digested read ... digested</strong><br> </p> <p>Mr Nobody finds himself all at sea</p>",
  "Last week's Democratic convention went off like a well-choreographed wedding. Nothing unexpected happened, there was no news, the outcome was assured, but it was magnificent nonetheless. The speakers leading up to the nomination performed like a series of perfectly scripted ushers, and, on Thursday night, the Democrats' groom was unveiled. <p>And, just as at a wedding, while there is that sense of promise and potential, one can't help wondering if the marriage will last. </p> <p>Will John Kerry be able to convert the bounce of this convention into a binding contract with the American people that will propel him to the White House?</p> <p>Despite attaining wide plaudits, Kerry's speech was somewhat overshadowed by the soaring oratory of his best men, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. The novice on the national stage made arguably the most stirring remarks of the week.</p> <p>Kerry's acceptance speech, however, while it was good on paper, while it hit all the marks needed to woo the party faithful and reach beyond to all Americans, fell down on delivery. </p> <p>Kerry's speaking style dragged what could have been a home run down to merely good enough. The lack of modulation in his voice turned what should have been inspiring into something much more ordinary. </p> <p>Without wishing to dwell on cosmetics over substance, Kerry did not look entirely comfortable in the spotlight. Midway through the speech he broke into a sweat that reminded me of the beginning of Albert Brooks' perspiration meltdown in Broadcast News. Unlike Brooks, Kerry held it together and rallied at the end, but it could have, and should have, been much better. </p> <p>For George Bush, despite his flaws as a president, is a formidable campaigner. As much as we like to mock his malapropisms, he always manages to pull it together for the big one. As painful as it is to admit, on his day, George Bush is a far clearer communicator than John Kerry.</p> <p>Bush did not let a news cycle go by before launching into his opponent. A retooled stump speech struck a populist tone in attacking Kerry on substance (\"he'll raise your taxes, we won't\") and style (\"he thinks the heart of America is in Hollywood\"). </p> <p>His speechwriters are also calculating that Kerry's exotic wife is a drag on the candidacy, Bush slyly remarking that the best thing about re-electing him is that Laura will continue to be first lady. </p> <p>Offering a pointer to where this election will be won and lost, Bush campaigned in four key battleground states this weekend: Missouri, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania. In 2000, Bush narrowly won Missouri and Ohio and narrowly lost Michigan and Pennsylvania. Sunday's visit to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania was his 31st since being elected to a state that carries a potentially crucial 23 electoral college votes.</p> <p>August is traditionally a slow month in election year, but both sides predict that this year's will be so close that they can ill afford to take a day off between now and election day, some 90 days away.</p> <p>John Kerry and John Edwards set off on a trail of campaign hopscotch similar to Bush's this weekend, shadowing the president with stops in Pennsylvania and Ohio. They also dropped in on West Virginia, a state that Bush won by six points in 2000. Democratic strategists believe that the manufacturing downturn, combined with a southerner on their ticket has put that state back in play.</p> <p>Over the next fortnight, Edwards and Kerry will visit 17 states, at times splitting up to take advantage of Edwards' perceived southern advantage. He'll make solo visits to Louisiana, Arkansas and Florida; all went to Bush in 2000 and all are in the margin of error this time.</p> <p>It is worth remembering that Al Gore did not carry a single southern state in 2000, not even his home state of Tennessee. Democrats are convinced that if they can prevent a GOP sweep in the south this time it will be the key to their victory nationwide.</p> <p>The single greatest advantage Bush has over Kerry is in campaign ad money. Due to the arcane campaign finance laws - written at a time when $75m bought a lot of ad time - Kerry is limited to that figure between now and election day. That cap only kicks in for Bush after his convention at the end of the month. </p> <p>Consequently he can go on a spending spree in August while Kerry has to husband his resources to last through November. Bush will be relentless in trying to turn Kerry's 20-year Senate voting record against him, replacing the war hero image with that of a liberal flip-flopper, whose one consistency has been in opposing increases to military spending.</p> <p>Kerry must rely on surrogate soft money organisations to keep the negative focus on Bush. Kerry's stump speech, which will get prominent play in the affiliate markets of his campaign stops, will be the main vehicle by which voters get to know him in the coming weeks.</p> <p>That's why it has to be better than good enough. Kerry should pay heed to a line from his own nomination speech: \"We can do better, and we will.\"</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Philip James is a former senior Democratic party strategist</p>",

  "John Kerry intensified his efforts to persuade Americans to change their commander in chief yesterday, saying he would move more swiftly on national security than President George Bush, and promising to lessen the burden on US forces in Iraq. <p>The focus on security came on a day when Washington issued unusually detailed warning of a possible al-Qaida terrorist attack on financial institutions in the US. </p> <p>The homeland security secretary, Tom Ridge, said intelligence agencies had identified five potential targets of an al-Qaida truck or car bombing: the IMF and World Bank headquarters in Washington, the New York stock exchange and the Citicorp building in New York, and the Prudential Bache building in Newark, New Jersey. </p> <p>The heightened state of alert is the most specific warning since the September 11 attacks, and deepens the focus on national security. </p> <p>Aides to Mr Bush said he could respond as early as today to the conclusions of the congressional commission investigating the September 11 attacks, which called for sweeping reforms to intelligence gathering. </p> <p>Mr Kerry, the Democratic party's presidential challenger, appears determined to put his points across before Mr Bush returns to the campaign bus tomorrow. </p> <p>Reacting to the administration's initially cool response to the commission's central recommendation for a White House intelligence tsar, Mr Kerry said America needed a more proactive leader. </p> <p>\"What America wants is leadership that's ahead of the curve, that doesn't have to be told by an independent commission - which they, incidentally, fought to prevent,\" he told Fox television. </p> <p>The theme of national security ran through Mr Kerry's appearances on the morning television shows yesterday as he worked hard to capitalise on his military credentials at last week's Democratic convention. </p> <p>Apart from swift action at home, he promised that a Democratic administration would lead to more friends for the US abroad, improving its standing in the world and reducing the burden on its 140,000-strong force in Iraq. </p> <p>The key words for Mr Kerry were \"fresh start\", which he claimed would repair relationships with European and Arab states and make Nato allies more willing to send forces to Iraq. </p> <p>\"I think a fresh start for America, a new president with a new credibility, has the capacity to bring people to the table who are not there today,\" he told CBS television. </p> <p>\"I know that I can do a better job of providing a rationale for those countries to understand their stake in the outcome and I believe we can put together a very different kind of alliance.\" </p> <p>He promised that he would send no additional troops to Iraq and, for the first time, that he would reduce the level of the force during the first term of his administration. </p> <p>\"I will have significant, enormous reduction in the level of troops,\" he told ABC television. </p> <p>\"If the diplomacy that I believe can be put in place can work, I think we can significantly change the deployment of troops, not just there, but elsewhere in the world; in the Korean peninsula, perhaps; in Europe, perhaps.\" </p> <p>The intensity of campaigning marked a departure from election etiquette, which normally requires a holiday hiatus in August. In this year's heated atmosphere an extended break could be fatal to either contender. </p> <p>According to a Newsweek poll, Mr Kerry's speech to the Democratic convention gave him a four-point lift, boosting his standing to 49%, compared to 42% for Mr Bush. </p> <p>However, a post-nomination poll by CNN and USA Today gave Mr Bush the advantage, leading Mr Kerry by 50% to 47%. </p> <p>That was still too close to comfort for Mr Bush, who is going to use the days ahead to lay out his second term agenda before the Republican convention at the end of the month.</p>",
  "Detectives hunting the killer of a mother of four who was stabbed to death on Saturday were questioning her former partner after he presented himself to the police last night. <p>Kerry Edwards, 39, from Rhydymwyn, near Mold, was found by passers-by in her car on Saturday morning in a lay-by on the main A541, also known as Denbigh Road, in Mold. </p> <p>They tried to revive her. </p> <p>She was taken to hospital and pronounced dead. </p> <p>A postmortem examination revealed that she had died of multiple stab wounds to her chest and abdomen. </p> <p>Her former partner Peter Davies, 49, from Mold, was being interviewed on suspicion of murder last night after turning himself in at Mold police station in the early hours of Sunday morning. </p> <p>The North Wales police had begun a manhunt for Mr Davies shortly after Ms Edwards was found. </p> <p>Officers sealed off the scene of the stabbing yesterday while forensic teams examined the red Nissan car in which she was found. </p> <p>They later surrounded a corner house in a road called Bryn Garmon in Mold. </p> <p>The area where Ms Edwards was found is flanked on one side by bushes and on the other by a factory. </p> <p>The police appealed yesterday to anyone who might have seen anything suspicious in the area of the incident to come forward. </p> <p>Ms Edwards, who was brought up in the Rhydymwyn area, worked as a team manager for a company which cleans industrial premises. </p> <p>A statment released by Ms Edwards's family said: \"Kerry was a happy-go-lucky lady who enjoyed life to the full. </p> <p>\"She was totally devoted to her four children, a son and three daughters aged nine to 20, and had recently returned from a holiday with them in Spain. </p> <p>\"Her children meant everything to her.\"</p>",
  "The initial euphoria at the rescue of the world trade talks over the weekend may prove premature. But at least the Doha round of negotiations - vital to boost world trade and jump-start the economies of the poorest nations - is still alive. A repetition of the disastrous failure to agree at Cancun last year could have killed the talks for years to come. In theory there ought to be celebration because rich countries have agreed to scrap agricultural subsidies, the main source of bitterness among developing nations. OECD figures show that industrialised countries spend a staggering $350bn a year bribing their farmers to produce crops, many of which could be produced more economically in developing countries. Abolishing these subsidies - 32% of all revenues - is the best thing we could do to help poor countries and it would be in our interest also since we would have $350bn to spend elsewhere. <p>In these circumstances it is very good news that rich countries have at least agreed to end their export subsidies (the worst part but not the totality of subsidies). The trouble is they have not agreed a starting date and when it does happen - and that is anybody's guess - the initial cut will be only 20%. Some of the poorest African states were delighted to have wrung special concessions on cotton out of the US at the last minute. But this should not have needed to happen because the World Trade Organisation is reported to have ruled that US cotton subsidies are illegal anyway. US taxpayers shell out $3bn a year to cotton growers, a mind-boggling subsidy of 100%, which has enabled th US to capture 40% of world cotton exports at the expense of third world growers. Another section of the latest deal enables concessions to be made to countries with special needs. Does this mean that Japan - which imposes an almost unbelievable tariff on imported rice of nearly 500% - will be allowed an escape clause? </p> <p>The optimistic scenario looks like this: having bought time until the elections are over (when no one is realistically expecting President Bush to confront his farmers), the US administration may be more susceptible to agreeing to attack subsidies before Washington's \"fast track\" powers (limiting the power of Congressional special interests to obstruct) expire in 2007. The trouble is that it is difficult to imagine President Bush, who increased protection to farmers when he came into office, suddenly seeing the light - and, judging by his speeches, John Kerry won't do much better either. But at least the show is still on the road. The agricultural gravy train is starting to run out of steam even if the brakes have not yet been applied.</p>",
  "President George Bush has been lobbying Tony Blair over the last few months to veto an EU plan to lift a 15-year-old arms embargo on China. <p>Mr Blair, who is on holiday, has been left squeezed between Washington and France and other European governments, which argue that the time is right to end the embargo. The US secretary of state, Colin Powell, has expressed alarm at the possibility of EU arms being used against American troops in the Taiwan Straits.</p> <p>A Downing Street spokesman said this weekend: \"At the moment, ministers are reviewing proposals with European Union partners. Until we see the findings of the review, we are not saying anything.\" </p> <p>A government official said that though Mr Blair would \"probably\" still vote for lifting the embargo, the prime minister was having second thoughts. </p> <p>Mr Blair's difficulty is compounded by renewed tension in the Taiwan Straits over the last fortnight. China has mounted the biggest military operation in the straits for 20 years and on Friday threatened invasion if the Taiwanese government pushed ahead with constitutional plans which would cement separation. </p> <p>China's defence minister, Cao Gangchuan, warned Taiwan this weekend that the People's Liberation Army would \"smash\" any moves toward independence by the island: \"We will never allow anybody to separate Taiwan from China in any form,\" he added. \"The will of 1.3 billion Chinese people cannot be infringed upon.\" </p> <p>China claims sovereignty over Taiwan but the US has pledged to oppose militarily any attempt by China to regain Taiwan by force. </p> <p>The spokesman for the European foreign affairs commission said yesterday that no decision would be made until at least the end of the year. In effect, the decision has been postponed until after the US election in November. </p> <p>The review has divided the British government's foreign policy makers, with some arguing that Downing Street blundered by agreeing to the review in the first place without realising the implications for Washington. </p> <p>Others argue that China is strategically important to the EU economically and it would do Mr Blair no harm to distance himself from the US on this occasion. The embargo was imposed in response to the Tiananmen Square massacre by Chinese troops in 1989. The French president, Jacques Chirac, last year led a campaign to have the embargo lifted. </p> <p>Mr Blair was caught by surprise towards the end of a dispirited European Union summit last December at which leaders failed to agree on a new constitution. The French government brought up the issue of a reviewing the arms embargo late in the summit and Downing Street agreed, not fully realising the consequences for Washington. </p> <p>At further meetings in April and June, Mr Blair backtracked, pressing for further discussion, including of China's human rights record. Bill Rammell, the Foreign Office minister, who held talks in Beijing last week on a range of issues, said: \"The arms embargo remains in place. The EU is reviewing the embargo. We need consensus and cannot pre-empt that. Every government is engaged and we have not reached a position yet to say the embargo will be lifted. We support the review.\" </p> <p>He added: \"The US has voiced its views on this issue. Our position on Taiwan has been a consistent one. Conflict across the straits would be disastrous. You need dialogue.\" </p> <p>The initial assessment of the British government was that China is so desperate to stage the next Olympic games, in 2008, that it would not do anything to jeopardise the bid, such as stirring up the Taiwan issue. </p> <p>On Friday, the Chinese press carried a report in which Wang Zaixi, vice-minister of the Chinese government's Taiwan affairs office, said military action could not be ruled out if Taiwan pursued constitutional change. </p> <p>The Taiwan president, Chen Shui-bian, said the planned amendments were only concerned with local issues, but Beijing suspects he has a pro-independence agenda.</p>"
