  "<p>FOR A WOMAN who had got off the red-eye from New York just a few hours earlier, Pamela Thomas-Graham seemed surprisingly bubbly and energetic when I met her recently. </p> <p>The 40-year-old chief executive of CNBC was in London for just a day - welcoming her new European chief, Mick Buckley - before heading off to inspect another part of her global business TV empire. She showed no sign of jetlag or airport fatigue. But then I remembered reading that she was one of those infuriating people, like Napoleon and Baroness Thatcher, who could exist, indeed thrive, on just a few hours sleep a night. </p> <p>That ability must be one of the reasons for the achievements she has chalked up in her remarkable professional career. She is one of the few black women at the helm of a US corporation, as she was the first to break into the almost exclusively male preserve of partnership at the waspish management consultant, McKinsey. She is about to start work on her latest novel, the fourth in a series of mystery tales involving a black female economics professor at an Ivy League college (Thomas-Graham went to Harvard); and she is the mother of three children, including twins just approaching their second birthday. </p> <p>It makes me tired just thinking about it, but she takes it all in her stride. Her day begins at 4am, with a couple of hours' writing before the children wake up. 'I always read lots when I was a child, and when I went to Harvard Law School I wanted to exercise the creative side of my mind. Mysteries are such a fun genre,' she explains. </p> <p>She has some 'quality time' with the children before heading to her office, and is sometimes home to put them to bed. Other responsibilities - she is on the board of the New York Opera and the American Red Cross - can make it a very long day. </p> <p>The heroine of the novels, Nikki Chase, is 'smart and sassy and sexy', according to the blurb of the latest, Orange Crushed . She too puts in the hours, ruffles feathers and upsets reputations in her quest for the truth about a murdered Princeton academic. It is no surprise to find that Thomas-Graham admits to a touch of autobiographical inspiration for her character. </p> <p>'Sure, she deals with lots of the challenges I've also faced. In the USA in the 1990s, you didn't find women or coloured people in senior management roles. They faced a set of issues which were quite unique, in that most people in business simply did not know women of colour. As you began to advance in your career, it made you very visible, and got you noticed at work. That was good if you were getting noticed for positive things, but if you made mistakes they got extrapolated onto the rest of the minority.' </p> <p>From respectable middle-class origins in Detroit, she was made chief executive of CNBC in the summer of 2001, just a few weeks before the 11 September terrorist attacks that changed everything for America. 'The first six months were like The Perfect Storm ', she remembers. 'The financial markets were in recession after the internet bubble, then came the corporate scandals like Enron and WorldCom. And 9/11 on top of all that. Overnight, we went from being a peacetime to a wartime economy.' </p> <p>This presented unique problems for CNBC. The channel, with its running ticker-tape of Wall Street share prices, market updates and talking heads assuming 'buy' or 'sell' positions, was a score board for the financial community. Its interviews with business leaders had the air of a papal audience, where the anchor and the audience were content just to listen to the great man's words. That changed. 'Suddenly, the business leaders became con artists in many people's eyes,' says Graham. 'What do you do then?' </p> <p>The answer was to go 'broader and deeper', she says. 'From being a stock-market channel we became a business news channel, and that was a big difference. We had to become multi-dimensional, with a greater focus on the economy, on Washington, on security and foreign affairs. We realised that how safe people feel at home was probably the most important factor in how they invest. And we had to become more sceptical and probing.' </p> <p>The channel had to expand its global coverage. This was partly a response to the greater importance of international events and how they impacted on US business, but it was also a sound commercial strategy. 'We have access to 200 million households around the world, and we'd never fully leveraged that.' </p> <p>It was a business opportunity just waiting to be exploited. </p> <p>According to the market surveys, CNBC viewers are 'high net worth individuals', with average assets of $1m each. Some 90 per cent have degrees, and they are intelligent, sophisticated and discriminating. 'Our audience will hang on in there and won't feel the need to have things dumbed down for them,' she says. She calls the channel the business network of record, and compares it to the Wall Street Journal in reliability and depth of its coverage. The link to the Journal goes further than that - Dow Jones is a CNBC partner, via the ultimate holding company, the giant General Electric Corporation. </p> <p>Other media organisations have learnt that foreign news networks are expensive and management intensive, but CNBC's business model is different, says Graham. Broadcasts from outside the US are centred on the great financial capitals of the world - London, Frankfurt, Dubai, Hong Kong and Tokyo - where business news can be presented in a direct way. </p> <p>This allows CNBC to fund more 'in-depth' analysis of national and regional economies, and industrial and financial sectors, in special reports and set-pieces from, for example, the Davos summit or Paris airshow. </p> <p>The channel's financial performance is not stripped out from its parent NBC Universal, but, with premium advertising rates for its top-notch audience, she says it is 'highly profitable. GE is a very demanding parent.' </p> <p>After her whistlestop tour of CNBC's global network, she is back in the States (homes in Manhattan and Westchester) to supervise coverage of the presidential election. 'There are two issues: Iraq and the economy. Obviously we will focus on the economy, and we have to answer the question of how the CEOs vote.' </p> <p>If this is a sign that she's going to tell me whether she is for George Bush or John Kerry, she never follows through, and we become diverted to another subject before I get the chance to ask. So I don't know how Pamela Thomas-Graham is going to vote in this election. </p> <p>Her background and east coast lifestyle say Democrat, her position as a self-made business leader says Republican. Take your pick. </p> <p>But for what it's worth, I reckon Nikki Chase would definitely be for Kerry. </p> <p><strong>Thoughts of Nikki Chase:</strong></p> <p><strong> ON RACE</strong> </p> <p>'Now we were both successful black women at Harvard. We should have been close friends and allies - but apparently Janice felt the place was too small for the two of us. And she would be thrilled to see me gone. It was sad, but true: the old school HNIC phenomenon (that would be Head Nigger In Charge) was very much alive and well in our generation.' </p> <p><strong> ON MEN</strong> </p> <p>'One of the well-established perks of an academic conference is the opportunity to flirt shamelessly. But after the autumn I'd just had, flirting with handsome dark-eyed men fell into the high-risk category' </p> <p><strong> ON CAREERS</strong> </p> <p>'In another life, Gwen might have been one of those smart, wise-cracking secretaries in a 1930s screwball comedy. Now it was a different century, and she was going to night school to get a degree in education'</p>",
  "<p>Some people have asked me why there has been more politics than economics in this column recently. The answer is that this column has always been about politics and economics - 'political economy' - and in recent months, the politics has been far more interesting than the economics. </p> <p>But this does not mean that Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, has succeeded in his aim of making the work of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) so boring that nobody pays any attention to it. Indeed, the governor can hardly open his mouth without being quoted on the front pages and the airwaves. </p> <p>There have been two interesting speeches on the economy in the past fortnight, one by the governor, and one by Sir Alan Budd. There have also been some interesting statistics, surveys and corporate statements suggesting that the pace of growth in the economy is slowing down. </p> <p>First to Budd, who was chief economic adviser to the Treasury during the chancellorships of Norman Lamont and Kenneth Clarke. His period in this role, 1991-97, included the more torrid phase of our membership of the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM), though when we entered it he was still in the private sector. </p> <p>He argued in the 2004 Wincott Foundation Lecture that the 'final objective' of ERM membership was to control inflation, after all other devices, including the monetarist approach he once advocated, had failed. Or, as he gently put it: 'I hope I can say without offending anyone that the experiment in seeking to control inflation by setting quantitative monetary targets did not match the hopes of its most enthusiastic supporters [among whom I am willing to count myself].' Professor Milton Friedman made a similar confession just over a year ago. </p> <p>Leave aside any thoughts that joining the ERM was about wanting to be more 'European'. For Budd, and many in the Treasury, the ERM was the counter-inflation policy of last resort. </p> <p>In a somewhat revisionist view of history, Budd argues that the ERM episode was, in this respect, a resounding success. 'I believe we joined at the right time and left at the right time, but that was a matter of luck rather than skill.' </p> <p>His thesis is that, having failed to devise a successful monetary policy before, 'somehow, when we left the ERM, we discovered how to do it'. Disarmingly, he recalls a 'particularly painful' City lunch in the (financially) hot summer of 1992 when he remarked that, if Britain were to leave the ERM, 'our credibility would be completely destroyed'. His host replied: 'That depends on what replaces it'. </p> <p>I recall a lunch around that time when I asked a certain Treasury official why they had (at the time) made it a policy of 'double' rather than 'quits' (the quits came on Black Wednesday, 16 September that year). His reply was: 'The Treasury has lost one Chancellor [reference to Nigel Lawson's dramatic resignation in 1989]. We cannot afford to lose another.' </p> <p>Well, as Budd points out, what replaced ERM membership was the system of inflation targets and monthly meetings of the Chancellor and governor (which became known as 'the Ken and Eddie Show'), publication of the Bank of England Inflation Reports and, hey presto, the deus ex machina of Gordon Brown and his granting of operational independence to the Bank of England in 1997. </p> <p>Post hoc, ergo propter hoc? (After this, therefore on account of this?) I wonder. Budd may proclaim 'it is universally acknowledged that the current framework for monetary policy in the UK is as close to perfection as fallible men can hope to achieve', but the fact of the matter is that all this coincided with a remarkably disinflationary climate around the world. And, of course, Brown and Ed Balls would argue that it was only after 1997 that inflationary expectations in the UK were really brought down. </p> <p>Budd's thesis is superficially appealing, but does not seem to this observer to justify the extraordinary pain inflicted on the British economy by the ERM episode - from which many businesses and individuals may never have fully recovered. </p> <p>Which brings us to Mervyn King, and his speech last week at the Eden Project in Cornwall. Is the victory Budd has declared over inflation a permanent one? The governor is not so sure. </p> <p>'Eden' is the reference point of the month. In his lecture, Budd half-joked that 'My usual preference, when talking about economic issues, is to start with the garden of Eden and work slowly forward, leaving the events in question to be discussed in a great rush in the closing minutes of the lecture.' </p> <p>I know the feeling. King, speaking on the site of the environmental exhibition at the Eden Project where, among other things, there is a tropical area, decided to hot things up. 'After all,' said the governor. 'Starting from the garden of Eden, there can only be a fall from grace.' </p> <p>The Chancellor must occasionally wonder about the day he made the Bank independent, and the second day (not the next day) on which he appointed King as governor. It was King who said on 14 June on the Chancellor's own territory (Scotland): 'It is clear that the chances of falls in house prices are greater than they were.' </p> <p>His remarks, producing headlines such as 'Governor warns of house price crash', had a huge impact. Indeed, some advanced economic historians already date the turn in the housing market to that speech. The Treasury was furious. 'The Bank is so amateurish in these matters', said the spinners. But the Bank was not amateurish at all. Indeed, internal Bank betting was pretty accurate at forecasting the following day's headlines. They wanted to make that kind of impact. </p> <p>So, here we go, onwards to the Eden Project, or backwards to the garden of Eden. King first reminds us that, about a year ago, he had described the period since the 1980s as a Non-inflationary Consistently Expansionary - or 'Nice decade - in which economic growth was above trend, unemployment fell steadily and inflation remained 'low and stable'. </p> <p>But, he asks, will it last? What he did not go on to say is: Do you want political spin, well-timed for the next General Election, or do you want the views of a serious, analytical, and hawkish governor of the Bank of England? 'What is clear,' he then said, 'is that the combination of low and stable inflation and continuously falling unemployment must come to an end at some point.' In case you are not fully awake, the sting in the tail was 'and may already have done so'. </p> <p>Mindful of the lessons of history and the burgeoning crisis caused by a $50-plus price of oil per barrel, King warned about future fluctuations 'in growth and unemployment, as well as inflation'. </p> <p>According to King, the Nice decade will be followed by the Not So Bad Decade. We shall see. This government has succeeded beyond its expectations in avoiding financial crises. It is not in the garden of Eden from the economic point of view, but it has a Prime Minister who has been as rash as Anthony Eden was over Suez. Despite the abysmal condition of the Tory Party and Michael Howard's position over the war, I still believe Britain intends to punish Blair for the biggest foreign policy misjudgment since Suez. </p> <p>Even George W Bush is on record, with regard to the countries that opposed the war, as saying: 'I know how these people think. I meet with them all the time ... They're not going to follow an American president who says follow me into a mistake.' </p> <p>Those who do, economic success or no, must be the Fall guys.</p>",
  "<p>Here they come. They have been called, but the movement is hardly noticeable at first. People shuffling along rows of seats, excuse me, ma'am, excuse me, sir, in ones and twos. Married couples in matching shirts holding hands. Now, some groups of giggling teenage girls, wondering if they should, smoothing their hair, checking their bags. Young men holding Bibles. Enormous people in outsize shorts, following their bellies, manoeuvring gargantuan backsides through gaps in the crowd, gripping half-gallons of Coke. People with sticks, on the arms of carers, watching every step. A silent army descending solemnly in bright white Reeboks and Nikes. </p> <p>Soon the first few make it down on to the magic green of the floodlit grass of Arrowhead Stadium, home of the Kansas City Chiefs. They are drawn to the centre, the few joining with others, the luminous turf steadily covered. At either end of the stadium - a great concrete oval of orange plastic seating soaring up to the black night sky - on enormous flat screens a vast face is watching their progress, unmoving. </p> <p>It is a face that demands to be on a stamp, or the back of a dollar bill, or carved into rock: the slightly hook nose, the firm jaw, the eyes darting under heavy brows, the silver hair swept back just so. It is a face that has been on screens just like these, framed by advertisements for Budweiser and Pizza Hut and First National Bank, all over the world. A face that created this very spectacle 60 years ago, has seen it unfold inevitably a thousand times and never tired of it. Occasionally, a hand, shaking now a little with Parkinson's and age, moves up to those huge projected eyes, as if maybe ( who knows? ) to stop a tear in its tracks. </p> <p>This is the third night of Billy Graham's crusade to Kansas City, to the heart of the heart of America, and the numbers of the saved are slowly growing. Evangelists normally love lightning - apocalyptic forks of it appear on the covers of several of Graham's million-selling books, including Storm Warning and Approaching Hoofbeats - but on the first night of this mission, violent thunder had kept the attendance down to a handful hunkered under stadium overhangs in polythene capes. 'Hell,' as Robert Frost once observed, 'is a half filled auditorium.' </p> <p>Tonight, though, the banked seats are full and Graham can mould that initial adversity, the heavenly downpour, into his sermon, just as he can talk of the great natural disasters that have spared him this year: how he and his family endured at their home in North Carolina hurricanes Ivan and Jean; how 169 bridges were swept away from their neighbouring valleys; how a huge mudslide passed within 12 feet of their timber house; how they lost their generator and lived in darkness for several days, Graham himself bedbound recovering from a broken pelvis. And so on. Until it is hard not to believe, as bright-eyed people have been telling me all evening, that it is a miracle the 'America's pastor' is here at all. </p> <p>That opening night was the first time Graham had preached to an audience all year. 'I feel,' he said, his rich voice cracking a little, ever the showman, 'like a teenager. Like I'm starting over.' </p> <p>He approaches the microphone these days, at 85, on a Zimmer frame, helped by his son. He pauses halfway through his text, a loose aggregation of good ol' boy anecdote and scaremongering scripture, to take a seat. As he watches the people come on down to be born again, he leans forward every now and then to remind them of the urgency of the moment, the lateness of the hour. And all the time he speaks, as his volunteer tellers take the names of those baseball-capped souls who will, no doubt, be joining him in paradise, you are invited to think of the numbers whose names have been entered in this way before, of all the statistics that stack up behind him. </p> <p>America loves zeroes and, if nothing else, Billy Graham provides the reassurance of noughts, the comforting economies of scale. This is his 435th Crusade; he has preached live to 210 million people in 185 countries; more than any man who ever lived. He has provided guidance for almost every American President since Truman. He was Nixon's close confidant, Reagan's devout ally. He stood at George Bush senior's side, Bible in hand, when the President launched Operation Desert Storm. He helped George W Bush through his drinking problems. He has more appearances on Time magazine's annual list of the 10 most admired people in the world - 46 - than anyone else. </p> <p>Though these facts come thick and fast, it is another of the evening's big numbers that gives me particular pause. Each night in Kansas City, the Crusade proceedings are opened with a brisk bit of business. This four-day event will cost, we are told, $4.8 million. This is to be raised by donations. 'Pull the envelope out of your programme, pay by credit card, write a cheque or simply put cash in it,' says one of Billy's sharp-suited warm-up men. 'Better still, just give us your wallet,' he suggests, before adding, 'I'm kidding about that last one.' </p> <p>The faithful may have only to walk out on to a football field to ensure ever lasting life, but, it seems, salvation does not come cheap. As the lines of people file down I do a quick calculation. Each saved soul is currently coming in at about $750 a pop. </p> <p>Then, as soon as the God-fearing men and women of Kansas are assembled, Billy Graham gets up, his work complete. Tomorrow, he says, he'll talk about 'the Day of Judgment, and about the great tribulation of the end times when some will be taken up to heaven and many will be left behind'. 'It should,' as Graham's sidekick of 50 years, Cliff Barrow, points out, 'be a very enjoyable afternoon. Bring your friends!' </p> <p>In essayist Thomas Frank's book, What's the Matter With Kansas? (published here as What's the Matter with America?) , he explores the reasons why the American heartland and, particularly, his home city, has turned so resolutely to God and the right. Historically, Kansas is a blue-collar state, the most 'normal' place in America, where Superman grew up and where Dorothy yearned to return. These days, conservative commentators like to call Kansas City the capital of 'red America', the great swath of the country that has come out in recent elections for Republicans and shows up crimson on electoral maps. It is, for them, a 'region of humility, guilelessness, and, above all, of stout yeoman righteousness ' as compared to the blue of the coastal conurbations, where people are 'unobservant, liberal-minded, relativistic'. </p> <p>David Brooks, writing approvingly in the Atlantic Monthly , described the population of red America as 'perfectly happy to be slightly overweight and a little underpaid'. Ann Coulter, the author of the number one bestseller How to talk to a Liberal (If you must), calls Kansas City her 'favourite place in the world ... they're Americans, they are great, they are rooting for America. I mean, there is so much common sense!' Billy Graham shares this feeling: 'You are the best people in America!' he repeatedly tells his heartland audience, by which he means, really, you are the best people in the world. </p> <p>'Kansas,' Thomas Frank argues, 'may be the land of averageness, but it is a freaky, militant, outraged averageness.' The Kansas state-school board has cleansed the curriculum of the necessity of teaching evolution. Public events, including the Billy Graham Crusades, are picketed by people with banners proclaiming that God Hates Fags. Pro-life spectaculars are routine. There is something very appropriate about the fact that Kansas City's biggest export is Hallmark Cards, flogging overpriced platitudes to the world (the Hall family, who own the company, are the Republicans' biggest donors in the state). </p> <p>In this climate, Graham's brand of commercial self-righteousness plays perfectly. ('God,' as Frank says, 'meets Mammon'). The evangelist, I am repeatedly told, is the 'real deal', progenitor of any number of similar Christian enterprises, but the original and still the best. He offers a version of Christianity which is shaped to fit American capitalism and individualism and, moreover, which supports a traditional, parochial American way of life and American power in the world. </p> <p>He is not so much a preacher as a broker offering stock options in God's corporate plan. Unlike most pastors, he does not have to bury the dead, perform weddings or organise bring and buy sales. 'I would love to see you all for a cup of tea,' he says to those who come forward, 'but we will have plenty of time for that in heaven.' </p> <p>What he - and the rest of his far more wacko imitators - offers to the heartland is certainty and safety, as well as a sense of affirmation of their morals. This sense of shared value is more a style than a rigorous programme. Frank argues that of all the divides in America, the key one is between the perceived authenticity of tradition-minded red America and its godless liberal nemesis. 'While liberals commit endless acts of hubris, sucking down lattes, driving European cars, trying to reform the world, the humble people of the red states go about their unpretentious business, eating down-home foods, whistling while they work and knowing they are secure under the watch of George W Bush, a man they love as one of their own.' </p> <p>The great lie of this position, Frank argues, is that Bush has done more to undermine those traditional American values, by pandering to vast corporations, by slashing the tax burden of the rich, by rushing America to war, than almost any President in history. In this, though, Bush is convinced, he has God (and Billy Graham) on his side. Rarely has it been more straightforward for a rich man to feel eligible for a celestial upgrade than in Bush's America. </p> <p>At 85, Billy Graham is planning just two more Crusades, one in Los Angeles next month and one in New York next year. Then he will see how he feels and probably hand all of the work over to his son, Franklin. This process of the succession has already begun. Franklin is 'CEO of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association', which has just moved into a new $13m headquarters in North Carolina (and which has an annual turnover, used mainly to run its Crusades, of $109m). He draws a 'modest' salary of around $200,000 (his father, reluctantly, takes a little more) plus the use of the corporate plane, which he flies across the globe. He provided the blessing at the inauguration of Bush, just as his father had blessed Bush's father. </p> <p>In a hotel room in Kansas City, I ask Franklin Graham if he feels ready to take on his father's work. </p> <p>'Well,' he says, in his quiet, measured voice, 'nobody can take his place in the world. But I have already done 100 Crusades of my own.' He is off to Nova Scotia in a couple of weeks, then Chile, and so on. </p> <p>Does he share his father's love of the heartland? </p> <p>'People can come and visit New York,' he says. 'But that is not America. Los Angeles is not America. These small places are America: a good work ethic, where people will take care of themselves. And where they live by Christian values.' </p> <p>I wonder if he sees that divide in political terms? </p> <p>'The difference between the political system in this country and many others is that religion is a big part of our life. The media in our country are mostly liberal and they have their ideas. But we have ours.' </p> <p>Franklin Graham became notorious in the first Gulf War by sending thousands of GIs biblical tracts in Arabic, to spread the word among their Saudi hosts. General Norman Schwarzkopf, trying to keep peace with Riyadh, was outraged. Does he regret that? </p> <p>'Here's my feeling,' he says. 'Saudi Arabia asks the United States to come in. But while the Saudis were willing for the blood of American soldiers to be spilled to save their oil fields, US army chaplains were asked to take the cross off their uniforms. I thought that was wrong. The Saudis gave every American soldier material to introduce them to Islam, and I thought we had every right to tell the Saudis what we believe.' </p> <p>Since the inauguration, he says, he has maintained a very close relationship with the current President. </p> <p>'I'm at the White House next week to do a Bible study for the President's staff,' he says. 'I speak to the President's advisers on issues all the time.' </p> <p>Graham has been most involved with formulating the Bush administration's policy on HIV/Aids. It was he who helped to secure the surprise $15 billion earmarked to address the disease worldwide and it was he who helped to shape a policy which favours the preaching of sexual abstinence over the distribution of condoms. </p> <p>'We [should] obey God and his laws,' he says in this regard. 'God has given sex to be used between a man and a woman in marriage, not between two women, not between two men. [If you deviate] sooner or later it is going to destroy your health. It could end your life.' (To protect himself from such temptations of the flesh, like every other man in the Billy Graham organisation, he never allows himself to be alone in a room with a woman other than his wife, Jane Austin, whom he married soon after he was 'born again'.) </p> <p>It is not clear quite how much advice Franklin Graham offers to the White House on foreign policy, though he says he has helped to shape thinking on Sudan, which he has visited on Crusades. After 9/11, he infamously denounced Islam as 'an evil and wicked religion'. I wonder if he stands by that? </p> <p>'It is certainly a very violent religion,' he says. 'You hear the calls from the mullahs every day on the internet. The vast majority are calling for the death of Jews, the killing of Christians. I have not heard one Anglican or one Baptist say we should kill Muslims.' </p> <p>Does he therefore see the current conflict as a struggle between good and evil as his President appears to? </p> <p>'We are in a Third World War. Tony Blair understands that. George Bush understands that. It is a global fight against Islamic fundamentalism.' </p> <p>And do such events, in his opinion, signify the imminent approach of a Judgment Day? </p> <p>'Certainly. I think Judgment Day is approaching fast. I think there are major prophecies that have been fulfilled. The rebirth of Israel. All of this was foretold. The great tribulation will come then. And this world will be judged for rejecting Jesus Christ. In America now, you cannot mention His name on television, you cannot teach the Bible in school, but you can talk of Muhammad all you want. Why is that? Because the great tribulation is coming. The true followers of Jesus will be taken up and the remainder left behind. </p> <p>Does he feel ready for Judgment Day? </p> <p>Franklin Graham flashes a quiet smile, as if the answer were self-evident. </p> <p>There is a measure by which Americans can determine how close we are to the Last Days. They can just log on to the RaptureReady website which monitors the world's press and comes up with a daily 'rapture index'. On the final day of Graham's Crusade, appropriately enough, this index is at an annual high of 155, owing to a couple of reported earthquakes. On the bus to Arrowhead Stadium, along a flat road on which Baptist churches stand side by side with truckstop lap-dancing bars, this sense of impending doom is almost palpable. Particularly for the one man who has turned up with a Kerry/Edwards badge on his coat. </p> <p>'The one thing that Kerry hasn't shown is how he is going to secure America,' the man is told, when he sits down. 'He keeps getting asked, but he doesn't know. He's a flip-flopper.' </p> <p>'At least,' another says, with some certainty, 'Bush doesn't lie to us.' </p> <p>'How can you tell when a liberal is lying?' another wonders, by way of a joke. 'When he opens his mouth.' </p> <p>The man with the badge points quietly to the President's failures in Iraq. </p> <p>'There's more people get killed every day on the freeway than soldiers getting killed in Iraq.' </p> <p>He mentions the trillions of dollars racked up in budget deficit. </p> <p>'You have got to keep a positive approach to life. If you don't, you are going to miss so much about America.' </p> <p>The chief defender of the President's record in this one-sided debate is a man wearing a jacket emblazoned with the logo of the Smiling Bus Chapel, of which he is the proprietor. The Smiling Bus Chapel, he explains, will tour from Minnesota to Texas, saving souls at Greyhound stations and truckstops. It will have an altar and pews on board, as well as 'satellite communications'. </p> <p>'I want American people in heaven,' he explains of his mission. 'The Lord told me to make it easy for people. Billy Graham started all of this, by bringing God out of the church. I make it even easier by coming to them. I tell them they don't have to go to church, they don't have to do any of that. They have to make a commitment in their hearts on my bus.' </p> <p>And do they? I ask </p> <p>'Well,' he explains, 'the bus is not licensed yet.' </p> <p>Shouldn't salvation be a bit more tricky than getting on a bus? I wonder. </p> <p>But by now, the conversation has moved on to the relative merits of Jesus Christ Superstar against The Passion of the Christ. The Andrew Lloyd Webber musical is the work of the devil apparently (and not just its melodies); the television networks which insist on broadcasting it should be shut down with immediate effect. Mel Gibson's epic, meanwhile, is the Word of God, or as close as we are ever likely to come to it. On this, there is agreement from Republicans and Democrats alike. </p> <p>At the Arrowhead Stadium, after the usual preamble about the shortfall in contributions and a plea to stump up the remaining $1.8m ('We're not leaving until we have it'), Graham launches, as promised into his apocalyptic stride. He is not going to talk politics, he says, it is not appropriate at election time. 'Still,' he suggests with a smile, 'I have my views. I think you can guess 'em.' Fifty thousand Kansans can. </p> <p>And, really, politics is what he does talk. In between anecdotes about down- home folks from Texas, he lists the world's horrors, the things all right- thinking Kansans should fear. The papers are full of crime, killing and rape. There are hurricanes in Florida; there are locusts in West Africa. In Haiti, apparently, they are 'eating each other'. All these are signs, signs that the Second Coming is upon us, that the End Times are approaching. And chief among these celestial signals 'is what is happening in the Middle East ...' </p> <p>Graham hardly needs to elaborate further, before allowing the stadium to fall silent and offer his audience their solution. 'The choice is yours,' he says. </p> <p>And right on cue, here they come again. Slowly filing down the aisles. Ready to join their fellow Americans in eternal life. </p> <p><strong>All Americans believe in God - <br>True or false?</strong></p> <p>Mostly true. 64% of Americans believe in God, 17% believe but sometimes have doubts, 4% believe only part of the time; only 15% of the population are atheists. All of the believers are convinced to a greater or lesser extent that America has a special place in God's plan, with around 25% believing that it is God's chosen country - offering as evidence the US's 'superior' democracy and fabulous wealth.</p>",
  "<p>In a community college deep in the Bronx, two smart-suited men are struggling to stick to the rules of a presidential-style debate. Fernando Mateo, a businessman and community activist who spoke at the recent Republican National Convention, is defending his President. Miguel Mart\u00ednez, a Democrat councillor in Manhattan and former teacher, is pointing out that 1.6 million jobs have been lost during this administration. The main issues are education, healthcare, employment - issues significant for all Americans, but this debate has been staged in order to focus on the specific needs of a community that both parties are courting ferociously this year as never before: Latinos. </p> <p>Mateo and Mart\u00ednez are Dominican-Americans. Despite a Yankees game going on nearby, the auditorium is filled with young brown faces, and the opponents are drowning out the miked-up moderator. 'Our children are disproportionately in bad schools!' Mart\u00ednez exclaims. 'There are 1.5 million Latinos looking for work! 13.2 million without health insurance!' Mateo counters with even less favourable figures under Clinton. </p> <p>The most oft-repeated fact of this election is that it will be won in the 'swing' or 'battleground' states. It's less commonly known that in five of those states - Florida, New Mexico, Colorado, Arizona and Nevada - Latino voter turnout and preference will be decisive. </p> <p>Last year, the Census Bureau announced that Hispanics were the majority minority in the United States. They are 20 per cent of New Yorkers, 40 per cent of Angelenos, and there are cities in Texas that are 80 or 90 per cent Hispanic. One in eight Americans is of Hispanic origin. More of them than ever before - about eight million - are expected to go to the polls this year, and a large number of those people are not tied to either political party. </p> <p>So far, however, their voting strength is not equal to their proportion of the population; many of them are not yet US citizens, though a legalisation programme in 1986 increased those numbers, and they will continue to rise. Perhaps more surprisingly, one third of Latinos are under 18 - they are the youngest minority in the country, which means the groundwork done by the candidates in this election will have an even greater effect in the next one. A Democrat pollster in Florida recently announced that 'the battleground voter is the Latino'. But Latinos are more than that - they are the future. </p> <p>It's striking that this vote is so genuinely up for grabs: although 60 or 70 per cent of Latinos now vote Democrat, that's nowhere near the 80 to 90 per cent the party gets from the black community. Cecilia Mu\u00f1oz, vice president for policy at the National Council of La Raza (NCLR) in Washington, the largest Hispanic civil rights organisation in the US, explains: 'What we've been saying is, the first candidate that figures out how to talk to us about education and healthcare in a compelling way, from either party, can lock up this vote. What is a source of great frustration is that the political process tends to look at immigration as the number one issue affecting Latinos, and then move on.' </p> <p>Immigration is an important issue - the last census counted 28 million first-generation immigrants, the highest number in history, and a significant proportion of those are Hispanic. But in every nationwide poll among Latinos, it has not been the number one issue. Sixty per cent of Latinos are US-born citizens; many live in mixed-status families, and so are more likely to be won over by the sort of immigration reform proposed by John Kerry (offering a path to equal citizenship for 8 million undocumented workers). But their prime concerns are those of any other American - only, you might say, more so. </p> <p>'The bottom line is, we are more likely than any other Americans to lack health insurance,' Mu\u00f1oz says. 'We are twice or three times as likely to drop out of high school, we are both more likely to be working and more likely to be poor.' That disadvantage has not been addressed by either candidate - though, to be optimistic, there may be some truth in the suggestion by one Bush-Cheney campaign official that 'Latinos are better off and more empowered if both parties are fighting for them'. </p> <p>The term 'Hispanic' came into official use in 1973, when the Nixon administration formally divided Americans into five races. As a result, according to the political commentator Michael Lind, the category reflects 'political imperatives, not cultural realities'. (Now the terms 'Hispanic' and 'Latino' are used interchangeably, though liberals prefer the latter, on the grounds that the Spaniards were the very people who destroyed the indigenous cultures of Latin America.) Many people call themselves Latino, but the people referred to in this way come from 22 countries of origin - how could they all be the same? </p> <p>There are Mexican-Americans (predominantly), Dominican-Americans, Puerto Rican-Americans, Cuban-Americans, and so on; first-generation, second-generation, third-generation immigrants. All have different cultures and views. As Ruben Mart\u00ednez, a writer and professor at the University of Houston, puts it: 'To say that a Cuban who fled the Castro regime in 1959, has voted Republican in every election and lives quite well-off in Miami has anything in common at all with a recent Mexican immigrant who's picking strawberries in California and lives in a trailer home, is just an utter illusion. It's a marketing term, and it's a term used by politicians at election time.' </p> <p>What is common to them all is their increased visibility - not just in numbers, but in terms of power, in all spheres. Jennifer Lopez, Salma Hayek and Benicio del Toro are some of the best-known actors in the world; then there are pop acts like Enrique Iglesias and Ricky Martin; bestselling writers including Sandra Cisneros and Fran cisco Goldman; baseball heroes like Sammy Sosa; fashion designers like Oscar de la Renta. Latino political voices are getting louder - the last US Treasurer, Rosario Marin, was Latina; Bill Richardson, a Native American-Mexican-American, is the Democrat governor of New Mexico. Latinos are excelling in business, and are more prominent in the military. Lieutenant General Ricardo Sanchez is the Coalition ground commander in Iraq, and 10 per cent of the soldiers fighting there are Latino. And there lies a crucial issue: whatever their origins, these people are American - and even prepared to die for it. </p> <p>Earlier this year, the Harvard political scientist Samuel Huntington published Who Are We? , an extravagantly controversial tome which claimed that this wave of Hispanic immigration was a threat to America's national identity. Spanish-speaking immigrants, he argued, consistently failed to assimilate. But demographic studies show quite the opposite, that Latinos assimilate overwhelmingly. 'You know,' says Cecilia Mu\u00f1oz, 'the whole purpose of immigrants coming here is to achieve the American Dream, which is in some ways the ultimate in assimilation.' </p> <p>Douglas Knight, chairman of ImpreMedia, the largest Spanish-language newspaper publisher in the US, thinks the issue is slightly different. 'What's happening is this kind of parallel culture - in other words, it's not like it's a continuum that goes from no assimilation to complete assimilation. There's actually this middle ground of people who are completely assimilated, thank you very much, but also have a very strong Spanish language heritage. I mean, these are Americans, and they love being in America. But they speak two languages and share two cultures.' </p> <p>My name is Maria Elena Durazo, vice president at large of the Here International Union. My parents are immigrants from Mexico and our family of 10 children worked in the fields of California as migrant farmworkers until I was in high school.' </p> <p>Durazo was speaking to a committee on education and the workforce at the House of Representatives. She is one of the highest-ranking Latinas in the labour movement. Her story might have been scripted for Ken Loach: she began as one of the least empowered, and is now instrumental in obtaining power for those like her. Although the membership of her union is 70 per cent Hispanic, she was the first Latina to head a local union in southern California. Durazo has ensured that large numbers of Latino workers - and they are almost half of the new entrants to the American workforce - are informed and organised enough to vote. Behind the scenes, her work has an enormous knock-on effect on national politics. And her personal history means she is perfectly placed to understand the needs of the people she now represents. </p> <p>'I started as an organiser in the gar ment sweatshops,' she says. 'I got hired as an organiser at Local 11 [the union of hotel and restaurant employees of which she is now the president] and for four years I witnessed a union deteriorate right before my eyes. The meetings were held in English only; the office closed down at 4pm - the time most members were getting off their shifts.' Durazo earned her law degree while working at the union, and managed, among other things, to quadruple pension benefits for members. Nationally, she has created allianceswith the immigrant rights and civil rights movements, and has got civil rights leaders from the black community to say: 'this movement and ours are the same'. </p> <p>In his book Crossing Over , Ruben Mart\u00ednez followed a family of migrant workers not unlike Durazo's. The son of Mexican and Salvadoran immigrants, Mart\u00ednez felt compelled to document the lives of 'outsiders' because, as he remembers, 'up until the third grade, I was the only Latino kid. I didn't want to stand apart, I wanted desperately to fit in - I felt I was pushed into that outsider's role. And from that point on, this became the essential question of my life. </p> <p>'I consider myself an American,' he continues, 'but I am often not considered one. I've been accused of traitorist tendencies, but the fact is I was born here. For the better part of my adult life I've used the term American to describe myself, and tried to claim the real promise of what American means, and to define it in terms that do include me.' </p> <p>In the last lines of Sandra Cisneros's bestselling novel, The House on Mango Street , the narrator whose name means 'hope' leaves her Latino community armed with books and paper. 'They will not know,' the book ends, 'I have gone away to come back. For the ones left behind. For the ones who cannot out.' [sic] In a sense, Cisneros and other writers of the so-called 'Latina boom' have done just that. By mixing English and Spanish, by giving a voice to a people who had none, they have brought them into the mainstream - fetched the ones left behind. Nina Marie Mart\u00ednez, whose first novel, Caramba! , has just been published to great acclaim, might be seen as a liberated descendant of that movement. But Mart\u00ednez herself resists that kind of categorisation. </p> <p>'When I sat down to write Caramba! - and this is the biggest clich\u00e9 in the world,' she tells me, 'I wanted to write the Great American Novel, because this is what my slice of America looks like.' Mart\u00ednez was brought up by an American mother and a Mexican father, speaking no Spanish at all (she learnt it as an adult, and became 'an immigrant to my own culture'). She dropped out of high school, became a single mother at 20, and to support her child when she went back to college, started selling vintage clothes in flea markets in California. </p> <p>'We all have different dreams,' she reflects. 'I just got almost $700 for a purse I paid 50 cents for. It's like what I do for a living is a metaphor for my life. I look very vulnerable on paper - high school dropout, single mother, Latina, no real job - but I'm not. My daughter's a straight-A student, she's very mature for her age, she dresses like Audrey Hepburn. I consider myself to be very blessed that I've figured it out. You know,' she says, offering up an image that might stand for the hopes and rewards of many new Americans, 'you get the purse for 50 cents and you sell it for $700.' </p> <p><strong>Americans don't like to leave America -<br>True or false?</strong></p> <p>Yep. Fewer than 20% of Americans actually own a passport, though 70% have been to Disneyland. Reasons Americans give for not wanting to travel: 51% cite fear, 26% express no desire to go overseas, 6% say they want to see the USA first and 7% just don't like to fly. For those who would travel abroad, European destinations are the most frequently named as the preferred destination, with Britain just edging out France and Germany at the top of the list.</p>",
  "'Bring a bottle, I'm making lasagne for 10,' is not a line that is frequently heard in New York. Here, where people are flakier than a Martha Stewart piecrust and most live in tiny apartments, dinner parties were dropped long ago in favour of eating and meeting out. <p>But lately, a strange thing has been happening to the social scene of Manhattan. People who once would have died rather than invite guests into their poky living rooms have been dusting off their wine glasses, breaking out their cheese plates and having friends over for dinner. </p> <p>Election frenzy in the States has spawned an old style of socialising, that of having people round to your house to talk about politics and stuff. 'As the election gets closer, it has suddenly become OK to stay in,' notes Elisa Lipsky-Karasz, the New York Post 's party columnist. 'Even my most flaky friends, who never cared about issues, now want to hang out at people's apartments to watch the news instead of going out to bars.' </p> <p>For the past two weeks, email inboxes have been jumping with invitations to 'debate parties', affairs that were unheard of in the run-up to the 2000 election. Four years ago, no self-respecting scenester would have wasted time staying in to watch dull Al Gore. </p> <p>But this time, the three televised presidential debates and one VP head-to-head confrontation provoked more enthusiasm and were more widely watched than Oscars night. </p> <p>Now that the debates are over, many people are wishing the candidates had agreed to a few more, so that they might have an excuse for more socialising. Instead, the rush is on to send out invitations for election night. It's as if New Year's Eve is coming early. </p> <p>What will happen in November when it is all over remains to be seen, but many admit that while once their after-work life consisted of hanging out in bars to talk about getting laid, they have now found a new satisfaction in turning up at friends' houses to mingle with like-minded people and talk about more important things. </p> <p>One girl about town I know confessed that the only people who'd made it into her petite one-bedroom apartment in the West Village during the previous three years were those who would be staying the night. But last Wednesday, she ended up cooking roast chicken for four girlfriends who had planned to meet in a bar but then admitted that they wanted to watch the final Kerry-Bush debate. </p> <p>'It was really cool having people over. We squashed up on my sofa and ate with plates on our laps. Then we hit the red wine and ended up talking for hours,' she said. Realising that her cooking skills have been wasted for a long time, she's now planning another dinner party for this week. </p> <p>Maybe it's the war, the threat of terrorism or that so many people want George W Bush out of office, but it seems that hard-nosed New Yorkers are suddenly looking for a little more intimacy in their social lives and a way to hang out that brings greater emotional rewards. Sex and the City now feels very last year. </p> <p>How else, for example, could anyone explain another bizarre activity that has sprung up recently. Cuddle parties, which many initially dismissed as a fad, are gatherings at which peo ple are invited to lie around and hold each other, but in a strictly non-sexual way. </p> <p>Six months ago, when word started getting around that Manhattanites were turning up to these events and spending an afternoon touching strangers they couldn't make a move on, most dismissed cuddle parties as a barmy gimmick that would never last. After all, what normal person would pay for the pleasure of having some needy weirdo in pyjamas trying to hold your hand? </p> <p>But, instead, the love is spreading. Cuddle parties are now being held in Los Angeles, Las Vegas and Washington DC. Cuddle party founders Reid Mihalko (a former bartender, model and actor) and Marcia Baczynski (a former life coach) have achieved cult status and are now in the process of training other cuddle-party hosts to keep up with demand. </p> <p>Their theory is that people, and not just those in that fast-paced singles' city New York, have gradually become deprived of intimacy and physical affection. That in an age where the currency of socialising is increasingly about sex, people have forgotten to enjoy the simple and healing power of the human touch. </p> <p>I can see their point. I, however, am sticking to a more traditional way of emotional enrichment - the joys of a bottle of wine, a good discussion and a plate of someone else's home-cooked food. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Bridget Harrison is a columnist with the New York Post</p>",
  "<p>From a solemn TV studio in New York, a news presenter is interviewing Rudolph Giuliani, the city's former mayor. Giuliani, a Republican, is commenting on the first presidential debate of 2004 and criticising John Kerry's wavering stance on the war. 'I agree with you,' says the presenter politely, 'he's had trouble articulating that in the past, but tonight he seemed relatively consistent.' </p> <p>'Really?' shouts Giuliani, leading the presenter to smirk in faux-submission: 'Coulda been my TV. Might well have been my TV.' The studio audience dissolves into laughter and Giuliani is doomed. The presenter is The Daily Show 's Jon Stewart, a man advertised on billboards as 'the most trusted name in fake news'. The phrase is a spoof of CNN's motto and Stewart's show, which airs at 11pm on Monday to Thursday nights, has made him a cult hero. </p> <p>So much so that, in some respects, the news he brings is not fake at all. Part news bulletin, part talk-show, The Daily Show features a set of 'fake' correspondents and a series of celebrity guests. But The Daily Show , now in its sixth year, is considered to be so influential that its correspondents are actually invited to political party conventions. No longer entirely artificial, they wield far more clout as a new breed of reporter: comedians with press passes. And the celebrity guests are real, too: both Bill and Hillary Clinton have been on, as has John Kerry. Once you get to that level, what exactly is fake? </p> <p>A survey conducted by the Pew Research Centre earlier this year showed that 21 per cent of 18- to 29-year-olds got their regular campaign news from The Daily Show and Saturday Night Live . The show has won five Emmys (two of them this year) - and, more unusually for a comedy programme, a Peabody Award for its reporting of the 2000 presidential campaign. It has been argued - by politicians themselves as well as pundits - that an appearance on The Daily Show will do a politician more good among a younger crowd than, say, an appearance on Meet the Press. Research has shown The Daily Show audiences to be highly informed, and General Wesley Clark, a former guest, has said Jon Stewart has 'tremendous influence'. </p> <p>Stewart, however, has staunchly defended his phony position. 'Our politics are fuelled by comedy,' he has said. 'We are not a power base in any way.' When John Edwards announced on the show that he would be running for President, Stewart's response was: 'I have to warn you we are a fake show, so you might have to do this again somewhere.' </p> <p>Stewart was born Jonathan Stuart Leibowitz, and brought up in New Jersey. His father is a physicist and his mother taught gifted children. He grew up fascinated by politics, but disdainful, in his own description, of politicians themselves. After college, he moved to New York and changed his name once on the comedy circuit, to avoid the kind of racial taunting he'd received at school. In the early 1990s, he had his own show on MTV, and then spent time writing and performing on The Larry Sanders Show . Since taking over at The Daily Show in 1999, he has changed the format, so that it is a sharper, more serious satire on politics and the media, and tripled the viewing figures. The show, which is on cable, now has an audience of more than a million. </p> <p>Part of the show's success is Stewart's intelligent and low-key screen persona. He has a trademark raised-eyebrow look of scepticism, but his most striking feature is that of being a softly spoken, all-round nice guy. Ben Karlin, who was hired by Stewart as head writer in 1999 and is now executive producer of the show, explains that although Stewart is 'the main force on the show', he 'realises that not having to be the subject of the story himself actually strengthens everything. Those other late-night shows ... I think Conan O'Brien's show is excellent, but it is driven by Conan's personality. </p> <p>'Most comedy,' Karlin goes on, 'aims to distract - it's not so intently issue-driven, and when it is issue-driven, it gets didactic and shrill. And Jon, because he's such a performer, is able to deliver material that's actually quite substantive and still keep it genuinely funny. And I can't think of anyone else who's able to do that.' </p> <p>Stewart, Karlin and the other writers of The Daily Show have just produced a book, which has instantly shot to number one in the New York Times bestseller list. America (The Book): A Citizen's Guide to Democracy Inaction is designed like a school textbook. One 'Fun Task' is an empty outline of the Middle East, with the instructions: 'What do you think the borders of the Middle East should be? Don't be afraid to group people with no regard for history and ethnicity. It worked for the British and the French!' A guide to Europe lists 'famous Europeans: Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, Johnny Depp and Jim Morrison'. </p> <p>Karlin is proud of the book, but, like Stewart, he will not admit their team has any public influence. 'There aren't scientific machines sensitive enough to detect how negligible our effect is,' he says. Stewart is contracted to stay on at The Daily Show through the 2008 election. We'll see how wrong they turn out to be.</p>",
  "<p>It is no coincidence that the two most popular books at my father-in-law's beach house this summer both revolved around conspiracies to murder and challenged readers to unpick byzantine narratives replete with false leads and murky religious imagery. But whereas Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code provided light relief from the increasingly depressing news flowing from Iraq and a potentially neutral conversation-opener, the 9/11 Commission Report was, in the hands of my father-in-law at least, literary anthrax - a lethal weapon that unlike Saddam's WMD, was very much primed and ready to go. </p> <p>Hoping to avoid argument, my brother-in-law Jimmy and his wife, Brenda - Democrats both - had packed The Da Vinci Code for their August break at the New Jersey shore. Knowing that in a presidential election year, especially one as charged as the present campaign, argument was inevitable, my father-in-law, Jack - a confirmed Bush supporter - had brought the 9/11Commission Report. The ceasefire lasted about as long as it took us to change into our swimming trunks. </p> <p>I can't recall what started it now. Probably, I made some passing reference to Michael Moore. The next thing I knew, Jimmy had raised the so-called 'Saudi flights' issue - the claim, central to Moore's film Fahrenheit 9/11, that in the days after al-Qaeda's attack the Bush administration had shown favouritism to members of bin Laden's family and other prominent Saudis by allowing them to charter private jets out of the country. Out of the corner of my eye I saw Jack reach for the report and turn to a page he'd marked earlier. Suddenly he was reading aloud: 'We found no evidence that any flights of Saudi nationals, domestic or international, took place before the reopening of national airspace on the morning of 13 September, 2001.' </p> <p> 'Do you hear that?' he shouted, thrusting the book under Jimmy's nose. 'A bipartisan committee of the House and Senate found no evidence ! Look, even your beloved Kerry signed up for it.' </p> <p>Two months later, the argument is still raging. This time the venue is Jack's apartment in midtown Manhattan where Brenda, Jimmy, his elder brother, also called Jack, and their sister Susie, have gathered to watch the Sunday afternoon football game. It is two days after the second presidential debate, the New York Giants are trailing Dallas 6-10 at half-time, and the subject this time is media bias. Jim, a union organiser and bartender at a hotel in Times Square, and Brenda, a book-keeper for a fashionable downtown restaurant, are convinced the debate was a victory for Kerry. Jack senior, a retired senior partner at the accounting firm Ernst &amp; Young, and Susie, who teaches first graders at a Catholic parochial school in the South Bronx, are equally adamant it was a tie. However, Susie and her father are incensed that nearly all the networks called the debates in Kerry's favour, while Jim and Brenda are still fuming that on the day of the first debate the New York Post and Fox, both Murdoch-owned organisations, published pictures making it look as though Kerry had spent too much time under a sun lamp (their brother, Jack, who runs his own video-conferencing business, is somewhere in the middle). </p> <p>'It was a made-up story,' fumes Jimmy. 'If anyone had a fake tan it was Bush.' </p> <p>'Why didn't he deny it, then?' his father shoots back. </p> <p>'Because then it becomes more of a story.' </p> <p>'In the latest debate he looked totally different,' says Susie in support of her dad. </p> <p>'No, I disagree Sue,' says Jack junior, sounding a conciliatory note. 'I saw the photo in the newspaper where he looked orange, but I didn't see it in real life.' </p> <p>'He probably got the tan out parasailing,' scoffs Jack senior. </p> <p>'He might have,' admits Jimmy, 'but then he didn't have an orange tan - he had a tan tan, a real tan!' </p> <p>Susie laughs, then turns to her father. 'You see, this is the Democrats,' he tells her. 'I don't have a tan, yes I do have a tan. Flip-flop, flip-flop.' </p> <p>Welcome to the Armageddon election, an election which pits fathers against sons, and brothers against sisters, and in which no one can agree any longer on the time of day. Never mind the war in Iraq. The battle for the hearts, souls and ultimately the votes that will decide who gets to occupy the White House for the next four years is far more bloody and divisive. </p> <p>America has always been polarised along racial and geographic lines. What makes the 2004 presidential election campaign such depressing viewing is that the war of words between Republicans and Democrats is increasingly dividing families along generational and cultural lines. In New York this summer I heard countless stories of children who were no longer on speaking terms with their parents because, while they were holding up placards outside the Republican convention in Madison Square Garden that read 'Somewhere in Texas a village is missing its idiot', their parents were back in Branson, Missouri, running Bush registration drives. </p> <p>Take Nancy Kricorian, an American-Armenian novelist and activist in 'Code Pink Women for Peace', a liberal grouping of New York women opposed to the war in Iraq. Kricorian says she has long given up trying to engage her father in reasoned debate. Although her parents live in Massachusetts - Kerry's home state - both are born-again Christians and, under pressure from their Bible studies group, have all but pledged their votes to Bush. </p> <p>'The problem is that if you're at all informed about what's going on, then, from my point of view, it's impossible to vote for Bush,' explains Kricorian. 'What's depressing is my children are now beginning to pick up on the divide. Djuna, my youngest, says, \"Grandpa Eddie's a Republican, right, but we still love him don't we?\" ' </p> <p>In Code Pink, she says, nearly every woman has a similar tale. 'It's like there's no common ground. People are tearing their hair out.' </p> <p>What makes the divide so baffling is that it has very little to do with substantive issues, such as abortion and taxation, and everything to do with perceptions about red-state versus blue-state America. Thus in the Republican heartlands or the red states, the myth is that voters live simple God-fearing lives punctuated by shopping expeditions to Wal-Mart and patriotic rallies for the troops in Iraq, whereas in the blue states, or the coastal Democratic regions, voters drink latte, drive Volvos and sneer at ostentatious displays of religion and militarism. </p> <p>Just as in The Da Vinci Code, everything hinges on arcane symbols and covert meanings, so in this proxy war it's not what you say so much as who you are and the way you say it that counts. That is why Moore's attempt to undermine Bush's image as a regular red-state kind-of-guy by exposing his family's ties to the Saudis so rankles Republicans and results in books with screaming titles like Why Michael Moore is a Stupid, Fat White Man . And that's why Fox's attempt to undermine Kerry by drawing attention to his tan - an effeminate blue-state signifier if ever there was one - gets under the skin of Democrats. </p> <p>If anything, this proxy war seems to be getting nastier. Driven by ruthless party machines backed by shadowy single-interest groups and pliant radio and cable TV pundits, it offers little pretence any longer at reasoned debate. Instead we have yah-boo playground exchanges in which tired allegations get endlessly recycled and everyone tries to shout louder than the next person. </p> <p>But is the divide between the red states and blue, between Michael Moore's America and Rush Limbaugh's America, as deep as it appears? After all, nothing sells newspapers like conflict. Even Graydon Carter, the normally well-mannered editor of Vanity Fair, a glossy title to which political partisanship has hitherto been anathema, has declared an interest, arguing in his new book, What We've Lost , that under Bush Americans 'are more divided than at any time since the Civil War'. </p> <p>But what if the chasm between red and blue is little more than a media construct? For example, although my American in-laws can take fiercely partisan positions, a lot of their arguments are less about the policies than about their perceptions of the candidates. And when it comes to bedrock issues such as taxation, balancing the budget and healthcare, the differences between them rapidly shrink. Both Jimmy and Jack, for instance, would like to see cheaper prescription drugs from Canada made legal, whereas their father agrees with Bush that there are safety considerations and there shouldn't be a rush to legislate. But none of them wishes to see America go over to a system of socialised medicine such as we have here, and though Jimmy thinks Bush misled Americans over the threat posed by Saddam's WMD and his supposed link to al-Qaeda, he agrees with his father that America needs to stand tough against terrorism. </p> <p>This interpretation - that Americans are far more united than they think - is supported by a number of leading academics. In Culture War? The Myth of a Polarized America, Stanford political scientist Morris Fiorina cites polling data showing minuscule differences between red- and blue-staters on a slew of issues ranging from the death penalty to gun control to race. Majorities in both camps strongly oppose giving black people preference in hiring while also wanting government to guarantee that black people are treated fairly by employers. Similarly, majorities of both blues (64 per cent) and reds (62 per cent) believe that corporations in America have too much power, and they're against outlawing abortion completely or permitting it under any circumstances. </p> <p>Fiorina concludes that reports of a culture war are mostly 'wishful thinking'. 'The bulk of the American citizenry is somewhat in the position of the unfortunate citizens of some third-world countries who try to stay out of the crossfire while Maoist guerrillas and right-wing death squads shoot at each other.' </p> <p>Alan Wolfe, a political scientist at Boston College, and the author of One Nation After All , goes further, arguing that Graydon Carter and other media commentators are just plain wrong. 'Compared to earlier periods - the Civil War, the 1930s, the 1960s - our disagreements now are not that deep,' says Wolfe. 'Indeed, it is only because we agree so much on so many things that we can allow ourselves the luxury of thinking we are in a culture war.' </p> <p>But hang on. If it's simply a phoney war got up by the media, why did half a million protesters take to the streets of Manhattan in August? I was in New York that week, and the divisions couldn't have been starker. On one side, wearing face paint and parading effigies mocking Bush and his justifications for war, were the massed ranks of the angry and disfranchised - what the Conservative commentator David Brooks in his bestselling book Bobos in Paradise stereotypes as the 'the New York Times -reading, body-piercing, Hollywood-loving, left-wing freak show'. </p> <p>On the other, dressed in neat polyester dresses and suits and holding aloft flip-flops mocking Kerry's vacillating position on Iraq, were the serried ranks of the conventioneers - good Republican 'folk' in Brooks's parlance, the sort of people who, when they aren't standing behind a New York police cordon in their convention best, dress in overalls and baseball caps and attend Nascar motor-racing rallies. </p> <p>One answer is that while Americans may be less divided than they think on economic and moral issues, they certainly are divided over the war in Iraq. And, in the case of Bush and Kerry, it's personal (according to aides close to Bush, Kerry really does make him 'scowl', reminding him of the haughty New England elite types he met, and disliked, at Yale). However, there's also more to it in that. Thomas Frank, the author of a new book, What's the Matter With America? , points out that the red state/blue state divide has its roots in the culture wars of the 1960s - a war that the conservative right lost. In the 1980s under Reagan, Republicans had no need of culture war rhetoric because free markets were in the ascendancy. It was only when the stock market bubble burst and Americans began looking critically at the new economy that conservatives began mobilising voters on such explosive issues as a foetus's right to life and a Baptist's right to teach creationism. </p> <p>According to Frank, this was mainly a political ruse, a way of harnessing the pent-up resentment at 'liberal values' - the gains made by the left in the Sixties on a range of social and cultural issues - in support of pro-business economic policies. Frank traces the genesis of this strategy - what he calls the 'Great Backlash' - to the early 1990s and Newt Gingrich's famous description of Democrats as 'the enemy of normal Americans'. </p> <p>'In the backlash imagination,' he writes, 'America is always in a state of quasi-civil war. On one side are the unpretentious millions of authentic Americans; on the other stand the bookish, all-powerful liberals who run the country but are contemptuous of the tastes and beliefs of the people who inhabit it.' </p> <p>Frank, like Fiorina, thinks this divide is largely an illusion - a myth put about by Brooks and Limbaugh and their allies at Fox. But where he differs with Fiorina is in recognising that it has immense rhetorical power - especially now that liberals are taking to the streets to demonstrate in an echo of the anti-Vietnam protests of the 1960s. </p> <p>'Democrats make a terrible mistake in not acknowledging the volatility of the backlash,' says Frank. 'They brush it off as crypto-conservatism but the passion and anger is very real. It's no use saying conservatives live in a parallel universe and that they're totally whack. The conservatives have succeeded in convincing people that the media lies to you, and in a very high-stakes election like this one, that can make a big difference' </p> <p>For my family, this process goes back at least to the Clinton impeachment process in 1998. Then, as now, I recall fierce cable TV-fuelled arguments at the New Jersey shore, with my father-in-law arguing that Clinton should go because, like Nixon, he had lied, and Jimmy arguing equally fiercely that there was no comparison between Clinton's understandable embarrassment about his affair with Monica Lewinsky and Nixon's deliberate cover-up of the Watergate break-in. There was a brief respite in the summer of 1999 when John F. Kennedy Junior took a wrong turn somewhere over Long Island Sound - a news flash I watched live from the shore (as for a lot of America, Kennedy's death underlined for my father-in-law the nation's loss in 1963 when Jack Kennedy, the only Democrat he'd ever voted for, was assassinated). But with the disputed 2000 election returns in Florida and the row over 'hanging chads', normal hostilities resumed, and since 9/11 it has only got worse. </p> <p>By this I don't mean to imply that my in-laws are for ever at each other's throats. In Irish-American families, as in many Jewish-American families, argument - even vehement argument accompanied by large amounts of alcohol - can be a form of communication, and usually the worst consequence is a hangover the next morning. But what has become more noticeable under Bush is how entrenched the sides have become and how much time is now spent disputing each other's sources. </p> <p>Take the row over John Kerry's Vietnam war record. Last week, one of America's biggest television companies, the conservative Sinclair Broadcast group, announced plans to air a documentary in which former Vietnam PoWs will accuse Kerry of 'lies, false testimony and distortions' for his remarks in Congress in 1971, saying US troops had been responsible for atrocities in Vietnam. Sinclair plans to screen the film nationwide the week before the election - a move which could potentially influence the outcome of the 2 November poll. </p> <p>But the attack on Kerry is nothing new. Questions about Kerry's record first surfaced in the dog days of August when another group of ex-Vietnam vets, the Orwellian-named 'Swift Boat Veterans for Truth', took out a series of ads saying Kerry did not deserve the three purple hearts he'd been awarded in Vietnam, and raised similar questions about his heroism. Although the New York Times published a detailed rebuttal of the group's claims and exposed their link to senior Republican campaign contributors, my father-in-law remained unswayed, and two months later it makes little difference that Jimmy has brought yet another newspaper cutting backing Kerry's version. </p> <p>'It says here that the navy officially credited Kerry with 20 kills in action,' says Jim, reading from the article. 'Commanding officers described him as \"gutsy\" in quotes. That's the final authority.' </p> <p>'You're assuming that article is quoting the entire record,' replies Jack senior sceptically. 'The one thing I can't accept is he's had three purple hearts in four months. That's impossible. You have to be seriously wounded to get a purple heart. When was there time for him to be in hospital?' </p> <p>This time even Jimmy's brother is exasperated. 'Why would the Department of Navy award him the medals if he didn't deserve them?' says Jack Jr. 'Come on Dad, be unbiased for a minute. If this were a flip and Bush had gone to Vietnam and the Democrats were on record as saying he deserved his medals, you'd be holding this up in Jim's face.' </p> <p>But if Jack senior refuses to accept evidence that contradicts his prejudices, the same might also be said of Jimmy. It's no use Jimmy and Brenda being incensed by Sinclair's plans to screen the documentary attacking Kerry's war record, says Jack. What about Michael Moore's announcement that he intends to show Fahrenheit 9/11on pay-for-view on 1 November. Isn't that a similarly blatant attempt to sway voters? </p> <p>'No, Michael Moore is right,' insists Jimmy, reaching into his wallet for another newspaper cutting. He holds up the headline for his father to read: '9/11 Probe Up In The Air On Osama Kin Flights.' </p> <p>'Listen to this: \"It's no longer certain that Saudis did not fly out of the country immediately after the terrorist attack.\" The Commission kept on going back and forth. First they said there was no flight on the 13th, then they said there may have been a flight from Tampa to Louisville.' </p> <p>Jack examines the cutting. It is dated 7 June - nearly a month before the commission completed its inquiries. </p> <p>'But Jim, the commission came out later with a separate report addressing that exact question. It didn't say we're not sure there weren't any flights, it said we are positive !' </p> <p>Later, when tempers have cooled, I ask my family what they think about the divisions in America. According to the latest analysis of voting intentions by pollsters Zogby international, Kerry and Bush have split the electorate right down the middle, with the Democratic contender leading the incumbent by the narrowest of margins. </p> <p>'There's definitely more animosity,' says Jack Junior. 'It's more mean-spirited.' </p> <p>'Fifteen years ago we had plenty of heated debates in this room - but it wasn't the same,' agrees Jimmy. 'There's so much more to play for today.' </p> <p>'In the past, it was more clear cut,' says my father-in-law. 'The Democrat candidate stood for this and the Republican for that. I think what we're arguing about here more is what the facts are.' </p> <p>He looks at Jack Junior for confirmation, then Jimmy and Brenda. For once, everyone nods. The next moment there's a cheer from Susie in the next room. The Giants have turned the game around in the second half and have beaten Dallas 26-10. </p> <p>Now that's one result everyone can agree on. </p> <p> <strong>Americans are very patriotic - <br>True or false?</strong></p> <p>True ... fully 84% of US citizens say they are very proud to be American. Almost everyone else (12%) says that they are 'somewhat' proud. Only 2% are ambivalent, while another 2% say they are downright embarrassed to hail from the US of A. The proud members of the American public are also in 100% agreement that the US flag is the best possible flag and are unanimous in their love for it.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Mark Honigsbaum's latest book is Valverde's Gold: a true tale of Greed, Obsession and Grit (Macmillan)</p>",
  "<p>FUGITIVE tycoon Asil Nadir is hoping for a spectacular return to his beloved Britain - as president of northern Cyprus. </p> <p>Nadir, who fled the UK after his Polly Peck business empire crashed 11 years ago, is preparing to declare his candidacy in the breakaway republic's presidential elections next April. If elected, he could visit Britain and claim diplomatic immunity: he still faces theft and fraud charges here. </p> <p>Northern Cyprus has been a haven for Nadir since his dramatic departure because it has no extradition treaty with the UK. But that could soon change: the pariah state is expected to gain international recognition as part of a unified Cyprus. </p> <p>Becoming head of state, however, would help Nadir to avoid being turned over to the Serious Fraud Office. Rauf Denktash, northern Cyprus's long-time president, is standing down at the next election. </p> <p>Peter Krivinskas, Nadir's lawyer in the UK, confirmed last week that the 63-year-old Nadir was contemplating a political career. He added that, if elected, Nadir would seek reunification with southern Cyprus in a deal that included a revolving presidency that would be shared between himself and his southern counter part. </p> <p>'Immunity [from prosecution] would follow from that.

  "<p>IF THE clever designers at Airbus had been asked to devise something to get up the nose of the Americans, they could not have come up with a better solution than their own chief executive. </p> <p>Noel Forgeard presses all the wrong buttons. First, he is in all but one respect (he prefers Coca-Cola to white burgundy with his lunch) very, very, French. </p> <p>And as Frenchmen will, he clearly delights in tweaking Uncle Sam's tail. So: he is bad at hiding his satisfaction in taking 'Aah-Boos' (as he calls the company he has headed since 1998) past Boeing, the once-untouchable totem of US civil aviation dominance. </p> <p>He is proud to bursting about the super jumbo A380, the most talked-about airliner since Concorde (another European production); and is happy to flaunt it as the US government and the European Commission enter a stand-off over subsidies that some fear could turn into a full-blown trade war. </p> <p>He insists that he does not wish to inflame an already volatile situation: 'We have never before or after the decision put any oil on the fire.' And given that civil airliner manufacturing is a duopoly scrapping for each of the expected 600 orders this year, a degree of zero-sum spatting is to be expected. But Forgeard's claim is frankly disingenuous. </p> <p>Everything about him seems calculated as a wind-up. Part of this he cannot help - his background, for example. Instead of hard-bitten entrepreneurialism, it reeks of effete elitism. After leaving the Ecole Polytechnique - the academy for high-flying French engineers - he luxuriated in the soft fluff of gallic corporatism, first at the industry ministry, then at steel giant Usinor. He then served time as a political adviser to the French Prime Minister before joining private missile maker Matra, where he worked for Jean-Luc Lagard\u00e8re, a mentor who would be instrumental in restructuring European aerospace, forming Eads with the Germans and the Spanish and helping Forgeard to the top Airbus job. </p> <p>Forgeard is diminutive, unlike the big brash boys who in the main run US aero space, and clearly enjoys understatement, self deprecation and mischief. Rather than lobbing intercontinental ballistic insults of the 'cheese-eating surrender monkeys' variety across the Atlantic, he prefers the droll kind of quip that a certain kind of American might only realise was an insult after he had left the room. </p> <p>Ahead of a Forgeard briefing at company HQ in Toulouse last week, one former Boeing executive forecast - accurately - that it would be crammed with the kind of one liners that 'drive them up the wall' in Seattle and Chicago, Boeing's home town and HQ, respectively. </p> <p>Forgeard ridicules US action against the EU on refundable state 'launch aid', which has seen Boeing demand the scrapping of a 1992 bilateral agreement setting limits on subsidies in both Europe and the US. He is even more scathing about the US's decision to take the EU to the World Trade Organisation over the subsidies, which immediately led to an EU counter-action. </p> <p>It has been called the worst dispute in the WTO's history. Serious stuff, for sure. Not according to Monsieur F. ' It is a very funny story,' he insists. 'We are strictly compliant with the 1992 agreement - and the Americans know this perfectly.' </p> <p>But surely there must be a case? The expressive brows knit, and his voice dives to a timbre that suggests nothing could be so ridiculous. 'I think it is helpful in the context of today for someone to have a case in the WTO with the bloody Europeans. But there are no facts, of course.' </p> <p>So what is the dispute about? Forgeard's face breaks into a grin that can only be described as an infectious weapon. He mentions a certain date in November of importance to US voters (he is speaking the day after John Kerry and George Bush's last televised debate, when they sought to make capital out of the trade war). </p> <p>But although Forgeard sees the funny side, he also foresees damaging consequences from the dispute. Component suppliers on both sides of the Atlantic would become 'collateral victims', he says, shamelessly deploying an Americanism. And the first, he reckons, is that other stalwart of US aerospace, General Electric, which last week lost the contract to power 50 of Boeing's proposed 7E7 aircraft to Rolls-Royce. Why? Forgeard reckons that because the Japanese are fearful of being dragged into the WTO battle - Tokyo provides subsidies to Japanese manufacturers, who are building up to 30 per cent of the 7E7 - it decided not to choose a US supplier. </p> <p>'The only company that cannot be a victim of anything is us,' he says gleefully. By the time either the 1992 agreement (which limits European launch aid to 30 per cent of development costs, and US subsidies to 3 per cent of industry turnover) is scrapped or subsidies ruled illegal, the major project requiring subsidy, the $12 billion double-decker A380, will have received its launch aid and be in production. </p> <p>The next critical project, a proposed long-range version of its wide-bodied A330-200 - slated for the A350 title - to take on the 7E7, can be financed without launch aid, he claims, observing that Boeing has applied for some $5bn of subsidies for its plane, which could be at risk. Rubbing salt into the wounds, he concludes: 'If tomorrow [the] 1992 [agreement] was cancelled and replaced with nothing, Boeing would lose $600 million of ebit [earnings before interest and tax] and we would lose $350m.' </p> <p>The \u00a32-3bn A350 may be financeable from Airbus cashflow, but if subsidies are available, they will be sought if the plane is developed. 'We will obviously apply for refundable loans,' he says, talking of a figure between $700m and $1bn. </p> <p>Meanwhile, he can't resist a side-swipe at All Nippon Airlines' order for 50 7E7s as 'political', dictated by Japanese manufacturers. Even China, a market every industrialist is sounding out, gives Forgeard an opportunity. He was expected to return from a recent trip there with up to 10 orders for A380s - for which there are currently 129 firm commitments from airlines. He did not, but 'is not at all worried'. This is because, he hints, an agreement with one of China's three airlines for six planes has been reached, but has been held up by politics. </p> <p>Not entirely Chinese politics, either. He claims Airbus has secured 50 orders for planes from the Chinese this year, while Boeing has only nine. 'Maybe - this is just a guess - the authorities there thought that in the month before a major milestone in American political life it would be a little bit much to make an additional order to the Europeans.' </p> <p>By now you can almost hear lawyers straining at the leash in Seattle. But Forgeard's record indicates that he would be a redoubtable foe in any face-off with Harry Stonecipher, his bull-like and famously short-fused opposite number at Boeing. </p> <p>His rise to the top in Europe indicates a shrewd political head. As an industrialist he is respected for his knowledge of detail. Colleagues recount how, shortly after his elevation to the top job in 1998, he intervened in a highly technical complaint made by an airline that turned out to involve defective steelwork in undercarriage assemblies. </p> <p>As an aside Forgeard mentions that Airbus, which has outsold Boeing in four of the past five years, aims to deliver between 315 and 320 planes this year. His sums imply an increase of up to 350 next year and more than 400 for 2006. This leaves Boeing forecasts of 280 this year and 300 next looking anaemic. </p> <p>As for Stonecipher, how do they get on? 'The answer is very well. Of course, we can't speak to each other without witnesses. He is a great character in the industry, and so we get on very well.' </p> <p>Apropos of nothing he adds: 'I am very confident that Harry will restore ethic to Boeing' - just in case anyone had forgotten last year's scandal over a contract for 100 air refuelling tankers that led to the resignation of his predecessor Phil Condit. Finally, he pays tribute to Stonecipher: 'I happened to meet him at the Conquistadors meeting in Wyoming [the annual get together of aerospace top brass, held earlier this autumn]. I think he obviously wants to renegotiate 1992. But I don't think he wanted a WTO case.' </p> <p>The message? Who knows. But it could be read either that Stonecipher is more reasonable than he has been portrayed, or that US politicians are running the process and he is not in control. </p> <p>Whichever, the smile that accompanies his words is that of a cat who has polished off the cream. 'It's my nasty smile,' he says. </p> <p><strong>What they say</strong><br> <strong> 'The right person at the right time for Airbus' </strong> Standard &amp; Poor's analyst Emmanuel Dubois-Pellerin, April 1998 </p> <p><strong> 'My gut feeling is that, by September, he will be gone' </strong> Insider on tensions as Airbus incorporated as a company, July 1999 </p> <p><strong> 'He is incredibly demanding and incredibly patient at the same time' </strong> Colleague </p> <p><strong>Profile:</strong></p> <p><strong>Name:</strong> Noel Forgeard <strong>Job:</strong> Chief executive, Airbus <strong>Born:</strong> 1946, Paris <strong>Career:</strong> Ministries of industry, transport, and defence; steel, manufacturer Usinor (1981-85); president Ascometal specialist steel maker (1985-86); industrial affaisr adviser to French Prime Minister (1986-87); senior vice president Matra (1987); president Lagardere (1992-98); managing director Airbus (1998); chief executive Airbus (2001) <strong>Family:</strong> married, three daughters, one son <strong>Interests:</strong> Fine art</p>",
  "US soldiers have far greater trust in President George Bush as commander-in-chief than in John Kerry, preferring the incumbent by a nearly three-to-one margin, a poll showed yesterday. <p>The University of Pennsylvania's National Annenberg Election Survey, which contacted 655 members of the US military on active duty and their families, revealed far stronger support for the Bush administration than among the civilian population - even among Republican civilians.</p> <p>Troops were far more positive about the war in Iraq and the economy - attitudes that could tip the vote in several key states. Florida, for example, has more than 150,000 registered voters in the military, and US soldiers tend to vote in far greater numbers than civilians.</p> <p>Sixty-nine per cent of the country's 2.3 million active-duty troops and reservists voted in the 2000 elections - compared with an overall turnout rate of 51% - and all indications point to an even higher rate next month.</p> <p>Ninety-four per cent of the troops in the Annenberg sample said they intended to vote. The survey, conducted around the time of the first Bush-Kerry debate, which gave the challenger a boost, did not directly ask soldiers their voting preferences, which is illegal.</p> <p>However, the troops made it clear they preferred Mr Bush. Some 69% saw him as a better commander-in-chief than Mr Kerry, who was backed by 24% of those polled. Mr Bush also scored better among civilians in a companion Annenberg poll, but only by 50% to 41%.</p> <p>Although Mr Kerry scored for his military record, with 40% seeing the experience as an important qualification for president, the troops were far less forgiving about his efforts to stop the Vietnam war following his return from duty, with 76% voicing disapproval.</p> <p>Some 64% of the military said it had been worth going to war in Iraq, while 32% disagreed. However, that support fell to 55% among those soldiers who had actually served in Iraq and Afghanistan. Among civilians, only 45% of those polled believed that the war had been worth it.</p> <p>The troops also appeared to have accepted Mr Bush's justi fications for going to war. Nearly twice as many said the war was fought to remove Saddam Hussein (29%) as said it was to remove the threat posed by weapons of mass destruction (15%). Eleven per cent said it was a war for oil.</p> <p>The soldiers were divided on whether the war had made America safer, with 47% saying it had, and 42% saying it had increased the risk of a terrorist attack. However, many acknowledged that America's standing had fallen in the world, with 42% saying the US had become more unpopular under the Bush presidency.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> The Pentagon plans to promote General Ricardo Sanchez, who was in charge of jails in Iraq at the time of the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse scandal, if Mr Bush is re-elected, the Los Angeles Times reported yesterday.

  "The Guardian's campaign to target undecided voters in a key swing state in the US presidential elections has attracted more than 10,000 responses, as well earning the ire of the conservative media. <p>By 6pm yesterday, 11,658 people had contacted the newspaper from around the world, after it encouraged readers in Britain to write with their thoughts on the election to voters in Clark county, Ohio. In the 2000 election, George Bush lost the county by 1% - equivalent to 324 votes.</p> <p>The Guardian promised to give emailers the names and addresses of unaffiliated voters, from a list purchased from electoral officials. In its launch article on Thursday, it urged: \"Remember that it's unusual to receive a lobbying letter from someone in another country.\"</p> <p>The paper will match voters with only one reader. No voter should get more than one letter. </p> <p>Most of the requests for addresses came from Britain, but some arrived from elsewhere, including France, China, Brazil, Eritrea and the US.</p> <p>Ian Katz, the Guardian's features editor, said: \"For millions of people around the world, this election will have far more of an impact on our lives than even elections in their own country, and this is a way for non-Americans to have some say.\"</p> <p>He said the article that launched the campaign was neutral: it provided contact details for the conservative Christian Coalition and the liberal National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. \"But it is no secret we are a centre-left newspaper and that our readers are likely to be pro-Kerry.\"</p> <p>The campaign has been picked up by the US media. The speaker of the House of Representatives, Dennis Hastert, has called for the Capitol Hill press accreditation to be withdrawn from the paper's Washington correspondents.</p> <p>Linda Rosicka, the director of the board of elections in Clark county, confirmed that the Guardian had obtained the 85,000-name voter file legitimately. \"We sell the information; it's public record,\" she told the Newhouse news agency.</p>",
  "Driving down Michigan Avenue in Dearborn a woman in a chador takes her hand off the steering wheel of her SUV to light a Marlboro. Through the half-open window she exhales smoke and Lebanese pop music. As she turns into Dunkin' Donuts her bumper reveals a frayed sticker: Vote Kerry/Edwards. <p>Dearborn, a suburb of Detroit, is the hub of Arab America. When the car plants of the Motor City had attracted all the labour they could from African-Americans fleeing tyranny and poverty in the deep south, they went for those fleeing poverty and war from the global south.</p> <p>And just as African-Americans brought gospel and turned it into Motown, so Arab-Americans are blending the culture of the old country with that of their new home.</p> <p>You will find more Arab-Americans in California and New York, but you will not find a greater concentration of them than here. One in three people in Dearborn is of Arab origin; Detroit is the biggest Iraqi city outside Iraq.</p> <p>It is by no means typical. \"Unlike anywhere else in America, you could live your whole life in Dearborn in an Arab-American bubble,\" says Jennifer Salan of the Arab American Institute (AAI).</p> <p>But, where electoral politics are concerned, it is important. The latest tracking poll shows the Democrats leading by four percentage points in the swing state of Michigan; Arab-Americans comprise 5% of the state's vote.</p> <p>By luck rather than design Arab-Americans are a sizeable force in many swing states, including Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida. In a third of the states needed to win the electoral college, Arab-Americans make up more than the gaps between the two parties.</p> <p>What is more they are up for grabs. In 2000 they backed George Bush. This year they are leaning half-heartedly towards his Democratic challenger, John Kerry. In a close race which will be decided in just a few places, Arab-Americans are a rare and precious phenomenon: a swing constituency in several swing states.</p> <p>\"In an election this close any small group makes a difference and this is one of them,\" says James Zogby, the head of the AAI. \"The way the polls look now will represent about 200,000 votes going from Republican to Democrat. What a party loses in one place they have to pick up somewhere else.\"</p> <p>\"It's not a community that any party has a lock on,\" says Ismael Ahmed, the executive director of Access, the biggest Arab-American social services agency in the country, which is based in Dearborn. \"Especially a community like this one where 60% weren't born here. We're not really committed to either party.\"</p> <p>And so it was that the Arab American Political Action Committee (Aapac) endorsed Mr Bush in 2000, leftwing campaigner Dennis Kucinich in the Democratic primaries, and Mr Kerry for president.</p> <p>\"We were motivated when we backed Bush and we are motivated now,\" says Osama Sablini, Aapac's chairman and publisher of the Arab American newspaper, who backed Mr Bush four years ago. \"The Bush administration has been a major disappointment to this community and we cannot afford four more years of this.\"</p> <p>To understand their initial enthusiasm for Mr Bush we must go back to the presidential debate in St Louis four years ago, when Mr Bush opposed the profiling of Arab-Americans. \"Arab-Americans are racially profiled on what's called secret evidence,\" he said. \"People are stopped. And we've got to do something about that.\" That was \"not the American way\", he said.</p> <p>\"You have to ask yourself why it took such a small thing to secure our votes,\" says Jumana Judeh, vice-chair of the Arab American Chamber of Commerce, who wanted to endorse Al Gore in 2000.</p> <p>\"Someone recognised our votes. Someone noticed us. We're the new kid on the block and the new kid is going to get kicked around the block until they stick up for themselves and then people move on to someone else.\"</p> <p>Add to that the fact that Mr Gore's running mate, Joseph Lieberman, was pro-Israel, and the Republicans looked to many like the best bet.</p> <p>\"A lot were opposed because he was so pro-Israel and then some were against him because he was Jewish and they thought he couldn't see beyond that,\" says Ms Judeh. </p> <p>On polling day Mr Bush beat Mr Gore by 45% to 38% while the independent candidate, Ralph Nader (who is of Lebanese descent), received 13%.</p> <p>Then came September 11. While none of the hijackers had American citizenship and Dearborn is home to few Saudis, the community felt besieged. Under Mr Bush not only profiling, but detentions, investigations and deportations became the American way for Arab-Americans. </p> <p>\"We were targeted in our houses, in our bank accounts, in charities and in our in our mosques,\" says Zouhair Abdelhak, a Democrat supporter who owns a jewellery shop.</p> <p>\"It was a total sea change,\" says Mr Ahmed. \"It raised us from below the radar to a focused-on group and put us literally physically at risk. Hate crimes went up five-fold. At the same time we went to war with Afghanistan and Iraq. And we were told that this is a war without end. All of that makes Arab-Americans feel at risk.\"</p> <p>With a sizeable proportion of Iraqi Shias in the the community, there was a split over removing Saddam Hussein by force. But those rifts have been mended by opposition to the manner in which the occupation has been handled.</p> <p>Accusing Mr Bush of betrayal, the Arab- American community started shopping around for another candidate.</p> <p>Most backed Howard Dean in the Democratic primaries. When Mr Kerry emerged the winner they went with him.</p> <p>Initially they were enthusiastic. A poll of Arab-Americans by the AAI taken in Michigan, Ohio, Florida and Pennsylvania in July showed Mr Kerry leading Mr Bush by 54% to 24% with Mr Nader on 13%. By last month Mr Kerry's lead had almost halved, down from 30 points to 18, with a large number of undecideds. Some fear Mr Kerry could slide even further.</p> <p>\"There will be a ceiling for the president,\" says Mr Zogby. \"And I think he's reached it. The question is do the rest vote for Kerry or not vote at all. Many of those in the undecided or even in the Nader category would switch to the Democrats, but have not yet found a reason to do so.\" </p> <p><b>Disappointed</b><br> </p> <p>On Saturday, when the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, John Edwards, came to Detroit, Ms Judeh went to the gym. Earlier in the week, during the vice- presidential debate, Mr Edwards was asked: \"What would your administration do to try to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict?\" </p> <p>Mr Edwards said: \"First, the Israeli people not only have the right to defend themselves, they should defend themselves. They have an obligation to defend themselves. What are the Israeli people supposed to do? How can they continue to watch Israeli children killed by suicide bombers, killed by terrorists?\"</p> <p>In a week in which Israel launched its bloodiest incursion into Gaza in four years, he did not mention Palestine once. \"After I heard that I thought I'm not going to go out and cheer for him,\" says Ms Judeh, who attended the Democratic national convention this year.</p> <p>\"I was a loyal Democrat. I distributed the tickets. But I wasn't going to go. We don't expect them to be pro-Palestinian. But they won't even say 'We support a just peace in the Middle East'.\"</p> <p>So while there is much loathing for Mr Bush, there is little love, as yet, for Mr Kerry.</p> <p>\"They are not giving us anything to work with at a grassroots level,\" says Fay Beydoun, who runs the AAI's branch in Michigan. \"People are very anti-Bush but we need to motivate them to go out and vote for Kerry and Edwards and they don't make it easy.\"</p> <p>In a community where alienation from the mainstream is pervasive, Republicans tell a similar story, particularly with regard to the Middle East and civil liberties.</p> <p>\"We disagree with the administration on them not dealing with the Palestinian leadership,\" says Jawad Allawi, a Republican businessman. \"You shouldn't give the other side a passport to kill people because those people have a bad leader... But I don't think any administration in the last 50 years has been even-handed in the region.\"</p> <p>Muhannad Haimour, who works for Access and recently founded a newspaper, Forum and Link, believes the community should have held out for more concrete promises before giving its endorsement. \"The community should have said, 'No you are not going to take our vote for granted'. If we have to throw our votes away then so be it. Instead, we're just going to just give our votes to them. If I vote at all I will vote for Nader as a protest,\" he says.</p> <p>An hour later he is challenged as to what he will do if wakes up to find Mr Bush has won by one vote.</p> <p>\"Well, I know, in the end I will vote for Kerry. I won't want to. Until the day of the election I will protest.</p> <p>\"But when I get into the booth I think I will have to because the prospect of four more years of Bush is more than we can take.\"</p>",
  "<p>On the surface there is little to commend Larry David. He'll obsess about his clothes and men who wear thongs on the beach. He'll arrange to play golf with his manager on his wife's birthday, wrongly accuse fellow passengers of stealing his airline tickets and even smuggle the head of a stolen doll down the front of his trousers to appease the daughter of an important television executive. On top of that, he's a compulsive liar worth $600m.</p> <p>But at a time when the British public finds itself short of genuine American heroes, this balding, disaster-prone, Brooklyn-born neurotic has emerged as the unlikeliest of saviours. Curb Your Enthusiasm, about David's cosseted LA life as the co-creator of Seinfeld, depicts a man at war with the world, yet prepared to own up to his many faults.</p> <p>In episodes past he has been variously branded a \"four-eyed fuck\", \"a self-hating Jew\" and \"a pool of wrong\", not to mention a misogynist. Gloriously glum, he is a curmudgeon, the bearer of a torch passed on by Woody Allen, Homer Simpson and Hank Hill. He rails against the foibles of polite society while finding a way to insult almost everyone he comes into contact with.</p> <p>David insists that the Larry David we see in the show is an exaggeration of the real thing - albeit someone he'd enjoy being in real life. On the recent evidence of a public dispute with an architecture magazine that ran a feature on his home in Martha's Vineyard, the divide between the real and fictional Larry is becoming increasingly blurred. He insists he will use the spat as the basis for a new episode.</p> <p>\"The show hugely exaggerates things,\" insists Jeff Garlin, who plays the repugnant if loyal Jeff Greene, of his famously media-shy colleague. \"In real life Larry's a real good guy. I'm about to enter my fifth year working with him. If he was like he is in the show in real life, there's no way I could do that.\"</p> <p>If the premise of CYE - Larry's life, Larry's friends, Larry's issues - sounds knowing to the point of self-indulgent, that's because it is. In real life, David is the failed bra salesman turned frustrated stand-up comedian, infamous in comedy circles for walking off stage. He happily admits scouting New York for places to doss if he hit bottom.</p> <p>After an unproductive year writing for Saturday Night Live he hooked up with old pal Jerry Seinfeld in the late 1980s and together they co-created and wrote the seminal US comedy \"about nothing\", Seinfeld. You might be forgiven for thinking that the fame and fortune from a global sensation would have cured Larry David of his melancholy, but you would be wrong.</p> <p>A recurring theme of the show, which starts filming on a fifth series in January 2005, is Larry's fretting about the minutiae of life. He worries about his pants forming a \"tent\" when he sits down, the heating at his aunt's funeral and whether his friend's grandfather did actually invent the Cobb salad.</p> <p>When Alan Partridge does this sort of thing it's because he's essentially an empty man with nothing else to occupy him. With Larry David, however, you feel that this rubbish really concerns him. Somehow it's comforting to know that a great home, whopping bank balance and a gorgeous, tolerant younger wife doesn't always add up to an easy life.</p> <p>Like its comic peers, Seinfeld and The Office, CYE scores with its realism, but unlike both it is unscripted. David prepares an eight-page plot outline and the actors are then required to improvise their dialogue. Multiple takes are filmed on handheld cameras. David and his team of executive editors then piece the best bits together and let the complex plots unfold to a now familiar Italian circus soundtrack. The results are consistently spectacular, compelling you to view unfolding disasters through the gaps in your fingers while tubas fart in the background.</p> <p>Curb Your Enthusiasm shines an unforgiving light on a vacuous world populated by characters such as Jason Alexander and Julia Louis-Dreyfus (George and Elaine from Seinfeld), Ted Danson and Rob Reiner, who all play versions of themselves. By season four, which has just finished its run in the States, Martin Scorsese, Ben Stiller, David Schwimmer and Mel Brooks have also joined the fray.</p> <p>Art is made to imitate life and vice versa. In season two, we find David pitching an idea for a show about an actor who finds it hard to get work because they are so identified with their character from a hit comedy. Spotters will know that Jason Alexander's character in Seinfeld, the stooge George Costanza, is largely based on the real Larry David.</p> <p>After a petty row with Jason Alexander, Larry takes the idea to Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who loves it. She is keen to pitch the idea to HBO, but her hopes are dashed when first Larry accuses the HBO president of stealing his prawns after a mix-up at the Chinese takeaway and then insults another HBO executive by calling him \"a cunt\" during a friendly game of poker. </p> <p>Their last remaining hope of getting a commission is extinguished when Larry traumatises the daughter of a key executive at ABC by cutting the hair off her prize doll. It is this belter of an episode in which Larry and his manager Jeff (alongside wife Cheryl, the only other main character played by an actor) are rumbled in the process of burgling the house of Jeff's estranged wife, played by the brilliantly foul-mouthed Susie Essman.</p> <p>\"I guess I'm a pretty likable guy,\" says Garlin, asked whether there's any resemblance to his character. \"Jeff Greene does some pretty horrible stuff. It would be fair to say that Larry and Jeff's friendship has survived against the odds. There are no lines that cannot be crossed. As you will see in future seasons there are some things that if I pulled them on anybody else, they'd say, 'Get the fuck away from me'.\"</p> <p>The genesis of the show could have been lifted from one of David's story outlines. He and Garlin were renting offices in the same Santa Monica block and one day, post Seinfeld, David invited Garlin to lunch. \"He was asking me questions about stand-up comedy and I told him that if he wanted to do an HBO special I had the perfect idea,\" explains Garlin, who had previously produced specials for comedians Denis Leary and Jon Stewart.</p> <p>The result was the hour-long HBO special, Larry David: Curb Your Enthusiasm, written by David and first screened in the US in 1999. Essentially a mockumentary about the making of an HBO special, it follows Larry as he prepares to make a comeback in stand-up. Forty shows and 20 hours of classic comedy later, David and Garlin, also an executive producer on Curb, continue to lunch both on screen and off.</p> <p>Going out on cable (HBO) has undoubtedly allowed David to trespass into areas restricted on mainstream American TV - even to the extent of poking fun at his paymasters. Politically incorrect gags about the disabled, racial minorities and the Holocaust, plus musings on topics as diverse as children getting drunk and incest survivor groups, ensure that the humour is rarely less than reassuringly dark.</p> <p>David recently wrote an open letter to John Kerry, offering his services as a vice-presidential running mate. In it he suggested \"whatever qualities Bush has that people find appealing... I have those same qualities in spades\". This from a man who caused a religious war at the baptism of his wife's sister's Jewish fianc\u00e9e, from someone who Mel Brooks describes in the final episode filmed to date as \"a storm that will destroy everything in its path\".</p> <p>Although he might hate me for saying it, I still believe Larry David is a man capable of restoring our faith in America.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Curb Your Enthusiasm - The Complete Second Series is out on DVD on Monday. Season three is showing on E4</p>",

  "Discipline and morale among US troops in Iraq was under fresh scrutiny last night as the military admitted that 17 soldiers were being investigated for refusing to operate a fuel convoy because of safety fears. <p>The soldiers, from a unit north of Baghdad, told family members that they considered the convoy destined for Taji to be a \"suicide mission\", citing the poor condition of their vehicles and the absence of ground and air support to protect the convoy. </p> <p>The refusal, confirmed by military sources in Baghdad, is the first time that concerns about equipment and safety have led to a major breakdown of discipline. Allegations about the state of US army equipment have been aired throughout the conflict and have become a feature of the US presidential campaign, with senator John Kerry airing the subject in presidential debates. But it is the first time that doubts about morale among US troops stationed in Iraq have surfaced so publicly. </p> <p>Refusal to obey orders in a combat zone is a serious military offence. Yet, the occupation has become a perilous situation, with more than 1,000 US troops killed since the invasion. </p> <p>Security fears have been heightened by near-daily ambushes and roadside bombs; yesterday a car bomb in Baghdad killed 10 Iraqis. On Thursday two blasts inside the heavily fortified Green Zone left six dead. </p> <p>All but two of the 19 reservists in the fuel platoon of the 343rd Quartermaster Company refused to operate a delivery on Wednesday morning. They were read their rights and moved from military barracks into tents, the wife of one of the soldiers told the Clarion Ledger newspaper in Jackson, Mississippi. </p> <p>A US army spokesman in Baghdad confirmed that a 19-member unit had failed to operate a convoy on Wednesday and that an investigation was under way. \"Preliminary findings show that there were several contributing factors,\" said Sergeant Salju Thomas of the Combined Press Information Centre in Baghdad. </p> <p>\"The soldiers raised some valid concerns. Unfortunately, it appears a few soldiers chose to express those concerns in an inappropriate manner, leading to a temporary breakdown of discipline.\" </p> <p>Sergeant Thomas stressed that the soldiers had not been detained or arrested. </p> <p>Two investigations have been set in motion by the 13 Corps Support Group. One, in Tallil, where the unit is based, will look at the nature of the soldiers' complaints, including the state of their equipment. The second will study \"whether any offence of a disciplinary nature has been committed and what other measures may be necessary\", said Ser-geant Thomas. </p> <p>The soldiers could be charged with wilful disobeying of orders, which could lead to dishonourable discharge, forfeit of pay and up to five years' confinement. </p> <p>According to the Clarion Ledger, Amber McClenny, one of the soldiers who refused to go out on the convoy, called her mother in the US on Thursday and left a message saying: \"They are holding us against our will. We are now prisoners.\" </p> <p>Ms McClenny told her mother that the convoys were normally escorted by armed Humvees and helicopters but that they did not have that support on Wednesday. </p> <p>\"They knew there was a 99% chance they were going to get ambushed or fired at,\" Ms McClenny's mother said. \"They would have had no way to fight back.\" She said her daughter had told her that the vehicles had been poorly maintained. </p> <p>Jackie Butler, the wife of Sergeant Michael Butler, was quoted as saying: \"When my husband refuses to follow an order, it has to be something major.\"</p>"
