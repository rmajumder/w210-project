  "There can be few jobs in the United States Secret Service as cushy as being one of Jimmy Carter's bodyguards. You get to wear the cool earpiece, and ride in the blacked-out SUV, but, seriously, who's going to want to attack the most decent man to have occupied the White House in living memory? Wherever they go, George Bush, John Kerry and Bill Clinton are surrounded by burly, paranoid-looking men, ready to wrestle you to the ground if you breathe at them wrongly. But on a crisp autumn day at the Carter Centre, a human-rights institute sprawled over 35 leafy acres in Atlanta, Carter's security detail are relaxing near one of the entrances, trading jokes, while their 80-year-old charge works unmonitored within. Nearby, the young researchers showing up for work in jeans exude the happy calm of people whose jobs mesh well with their consciences. As they pass in the pink-walled lobby, they pause, make eye contact, and wish you good morning like they really mean it. All of which makes the question of how to address Carter slightly fraught. The standard practice (though not, I later learn, the official etiquette) is to call all former presidents \"Mr President\". But somewhere this informal, can that really be appropriate? <p>Actually, yes. The 39th president of the United States, in shirtsleeves and loafers today, is a man forever caught between niceness and grandeur. One of the two condescending cliches about him is that he was too nice for the White House, and perhaps in defiance, his manner remains somewhat imperious. With its gold-fringed American flag and massive, intricately carved desk, his private workplace seems like a replica Oval Office; the rumour used to be that his laptop still played Hail To The Chief when it was booted up. His use of the first-person plural, meanwhile, can sound decidedly royal. \"What we did, in our time, was to keep the country at peace,\" he will say later, in honeyed vowels that combine a lifetime in the political aristocracy with his origins as a Georgia peanut farmer. \"We had a very good actual record.\" </p> <p>But the grandeur vanishes, replaced by beaming smiles, whenever he talks about The Hornet's Nest, the book that recently made him the first former president to publish a novel. \"Are you familiar with Patrick O'Brian?\" he asks with excitement, explaining part of the inspiration for his densely researched tale of the American war of independence. I confess that I haven't read my way through O'Brian's long list of cult seafaring tales. \"I have,\" he responds. \"I've read all the way through them, and I'm reading them for a second time now.\" </p> <p>The other Carter cliche is that he is the best former president America has ever had. The fading popular memory of his administration is still dominated by the 444-day hostage crisis in Iran, in which 66 Americans were kidnapped, 52 of them held for months, and eight US servicemen were killed in a botched rescue mission. The Carter \"post-presidency\", by contrast, has been a marathon of valuable diplomacy in North Korea, the Middle East, Haiti and Cuba, of election-monitoring and Nobel Peace prize-winning. The Carter Centre, besides its conflict resolution work, has helped nearly eliminate several major world diseases. More recently, Carter has broken with ex-presidential etiquette by attacking Bush and Tony Blair for invading Iraq on the basis of \"lies or misinterpretations\", and savaged Jeb Bush over the potential for a new election fiasco in Florida. In his spare time, he paints. He makes furniture in his workshop in Plains, the Georgia village where he was born in the era of segregation. He studies Native American history. He writes poems. He is, depending on whom you believe, either an exuberant polymath, or a man still flailing to find a secure historical legacy. </p> <p>If it's the latter, I'm not sure The Hornet's Nest is going to help much. At 465 pages, the detail-laden story of Pratt, a Philadelphian lured to the South to fight for the American cause, is something of a slog, leavened mainly by its unintentionally funny sex scenes. (\"He was overwhelmed with a feeling of tenderness,\" one already much-mocked passage runs, \"and was also aroused sexually, which his tight trousers made obvious to both of them.\") </p> <p>Still, one neglected truth about the revolutionary war, deeply ironic today, jumps out from the novel: America owes its independence to the French. \"I never dreamed that by the time the book went into print, America would be refusing to eat so-called french fries, and things of that category,\" Carter says. \"Quite a ridiculous development. We could never have won the revolutionary war had it not been for the French.\" He smiles. \"Although the French didn't do it out of altruism, or love of America. They did it out of hatred for Great Britain.\" </p> <p>The more Carter talks, the more he gently lectures on the lessons of history and the dangers of the present moment, the more difficult it becomes to accept the idea that he was too nice for the presidency. Now that we know what happens when macho posturing replaces niceness at the White House, Carter's decency - his quiet moralism, his intense but low-key religiosity, his rock-solid marriage to his wife Rosalynn - all come to seem less like unaffordable indulgences and more like urgent necessities. (When it comes to toughness, in any case, there is style and there is substance: Carter, on taking office, had spent more years in the military than any 20th-century president except Eisenhower.) </p> <p>So why does he think the US electorate punished him so badly over Iran - a crisis that wasn't his choice, and in which relatively few Americans died - while the polls are so split about Bush's arguably far worse, and certainly more deadly, adventure in Iraq? </p> <p>\"I think the basic reason is that our country suffered, in 9/11, a terrible and shocking attack ... and George Bush has been adroit at exploiting that attack, and he has elevated himself, in the consciousness of many Americans, to a heroic commander-in-chief, fighting a global threat against America,\" Carter says. \"He's repeatedly played that card, and to some degree quite successfully. I think that success has dissipated. I don't know if it's dissipating fast enough to affect the election. We'll soon know.\" </p> <p>The bitter truth seems to be that the Iranian debacle was received so badly precisely because Carter had proven so successful, in other respects, at keeping the peace - whereas now, there's a war on. \"When your troops go to war, the prime minister or the president change overnight from an administrator, dealing with taxation and welfare and health and deteriorating roads, into the commander-in-chief,\" he says. \"And it's just become almost unpatriotic to describe Bush's fallacious and ill-advised and mistaken and sometimes misleading actions. The press have been cowed, because they didn't want to be unpatriotic. There has been a lack of inquisitive journalism. In fact, it's hard to think of a major medium in the United States that has been objective and fair and balanced, and critical when criticism was deserved.\" </p> <p>Another hazard of being a former president, it seems, is that you feel the force of your successors' policy reversals with all the acuteness of personal slights. \"All of those long, tedious negotiations that were done by Dwight Eisenhower, John Kennedy, Nixon and me and Reagan, to control the spread of nuclear weapons have been abandoned by Bush,\" he sighs. Carter praises Kerry for \"bringing out the fallacies of Bush's foreign policy\", but warns that he must \"show consistency in his positions, and that he's a strong leader. That's the only advice I'd give.\" </p> <p>Carter rejects the worst criticism that could be made of his administration: that his alleged softness in the face of Islamist terrorism helped nourish the threat that culminated in today's al-Qaida. \"I don't think that's an accurate assessment. \"The entire Islamic world condemned Iran. Nowadays, because of the unwarranted invasion of Iraq by Bush and Blair, which was a completely unjust adventure based on misleading statements, and the lack of any effort to resolve the Palestinian issue, [there is] massive Islamic condemnation of the United States.\" </p> <p> Still, it must be tough, having held the most powerful position in the world, to have so many people continue to believe that everything you've done since has been more impressive. Does the \"best former president\" line irritate him? \"Maybe it did at the beginning. But I don't have any doubt that my post-presidency has made some historians go back and look at the administration with a more benevolent and approving attitude. We promoted human rights, we promoted freedom, we promoted peace between others - peace between Israel and Egypt,\" in the Camp David accords. \"I feel quite at ease about the presidential record, and also the post-presidential. But I like to do different things. Last April, I began to paint...\" And he is smiling again, plunging back into the details of his richly varied life. </p> <p>Perhaps it is no wonder that Carter is still most aglow when he speaks of Plains, where he will sometimes rise at five, in the morning stillness, and write for five or six hours at a time. \"And then, when I'm tired of my computer screen, I usually go to my farmland to visit my crops, or to my woodlands, or I build another piece of furniture, or paint a picture. It's a very wonderful opportunity I have. Almost complete isolation.\" </p> <p>But he is a long way from retiring there permanently yet. \"I've got to go,\" he says suddenly. \"I have to go to Grenada.\" He jumps from his seat and vanishes to a private room behind his office. The interview is over and, as you leave, you find, to your surprise, that you've caught a bit of his glow - that you feel genuinely hopeful for hurricane-torn Grenada, and nostalgic for the days when the worst that could be said about a president's character was that he made himself look silly when he admitted to feeling lust in his heart for women who weren't his wife. </p> <p>Meanwhile, outside in the cool air, the happiest Secret Service operatives in all of America are bouncing on their feet to keep warm. Their conversation is beginning to drift towards wondering when Carter will be ready to be driven to the airport. But it would be wrong to suggest that they seem particularly worried about performing this crucial bit of bodyguarding. </p> <p>\"Shall we go find him?\" one of them asks. </p> <p>His colleague performs an exaggeratedly nonchalant shrug. \"He knows where the van is.\" </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> The Hornet's Nest by Jimmy Carter is published by Simon &amp; Schushter at \u00a317.99.

  "<p>With a week to go before the election, the sounds of silence about the main cause of economic instability are deafening. Perhaps that is because for 17 years there has been one gatekeeper of US economic policy: Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan - reinstated for a fifth term partly because he's the most vocal cheerleader of Bush's plans to cut taxes for the rich, mortgage the federal budget and privatise social security. </p> <p>Since his appointment in 1987, Greenspan has glided over an epic savings and loans crisis and merely levied a token 25-basis point rate rise to curtail the runaway stock market of the 90s. As the market came crashing down, he cut rates 11 times, enabling ever-larger banks access to even cheaper money to pump into corporate America. Greenspan's reaction to fraud fallout and bank misconduct was to bless more mega-mergers. </p> <p>After the bank-inspired corporate implosions came finger pointing, job cutting, and benefit slashing. Inculpability ran rampant - in the boardroom, on Wall Street and in Washington. It was \"the economy\" that hurt the economy, not the corporate debt overhang, cooked books, faux stock market or loose policy. </p> <p>Criticism of conflicts of interest on Wall Street never came from the Fed, nor the Bush administration, the SEC, Congress, or even John Kerry, former member of the Senate banking committee. It came from Eliot Spitzer, attorney general of New York. </p> <p>The finance, insurance and real estate sector pays well to be so overlooked. It poured $775m into political pockets over the past three election cycles: 59% to the Republicans, 41% to the Democrats. My former employer, Goldman Sachs, outdid itself this election, leading corporate American campaign donations with $4.8m. </p> <p>During the third presidential debate, Bush cooed: \"We've come through a recession, a stock market decline, an attack on our country. And yet ... this economy is growing.\" He says he has created 1.9 million jobs. Kerry says he has lost more than any president since Herbert Hoover. Neither candidate broached the connection between job losses and the deregulated corporate environment. Yet US firms produced more bankruptcies over the past few years than in any other period in US history. They created the widest wage gap between the average worker and average Fortune 500 chief executive. They cut jobs and pension plans to compensate. </p> <p>In 1929, America experienced a market crash followed by years of depression in which 25% of the population lost jobs. It was caused by wild speculation, availability of cheap money, and deception. The Glass-Steagall Act in 1933 separated bank functions in order to avoid conflicts of interest. It fostered stability for decades. </p> <p>It has been ripped apart by Greenspan, bipartisan Congresses, Robert Rubin, Clinton's treasury secretary, and now Citigroup's vice-chairman, and by regulatory neglect. The bigger financial institutions become, the greater the competition among them and the more incentive to fabricate value. On this impending crisis, Bush is a lost cause, Kerry a disappointment and Greenspan the biggest economic danger no matter who wins. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Nomi Prins wrote Other People's Money: The Corporate Mugging of America (The New Press) released in UK this week</p>",
  "<p>Oil prices are heading for $60 a barrel. Motorists in the United States are getting their heads round the idea of paying $2 for a gallon of gas. Eighteen months after the ousting of Saddam Hussein was supposed to put the skids under the cost of crude, you might imagine America's reliance on imported fuel would be a crucial issue in the race for the White House. It isn't.</p> <p>America is racking up trade deficits of $50bn a month and anger is growing out in the industrial heartlands about China's refusal to revalue its currency. Yet trade policy is a peripheral issue as George Bush and John Kerry enter the last week of campaigning.</p> <p>You have to go back as far as Herbert Hoover to find a president with a worse record on jobs than the incumbent and poverty is on the increase in the world's largest economy. The stock market, which boomed under Clinton, suffered under Bush as a result of the dotcom boom's collapse, recession and a string of corporate scandals, as the chart above shows. Yet, if you listen to the candidates and monitor the media, jobs are not the real issue.</p> <p>What matters in this election is the fitness or otherwise of Bush or Kerry to be commander in chief. It is about who has the \"right stuff\", who can best defend the American homeland from terrorism, who can be trusted with national security.</p> <p>By his attacks on Kerry's integrity, Bush has avoided the problem his father faced when Bill Clinton persuaded voters that the economy was what mattered, not the victory over Saddam in the first Gulf war. If there was ever an election where \"it's the economy, stupid\" mattered, then this should be it. But that is not the case. As Mark Granakis, a branch president of the steelworkers' union in Ohio, puts it: \"Franklin Roosevelt told us the only thing we had to fear was fear itself. This president says: 'Be afraid'.\"</p> <p>That Bush has to campaign in this way, more like a challenger than the incumbent, is a sign of weakness, not strength.</p> <p>Consider the evidence. The statistics suggest that the economy has done well under Bush. After all, he came into office at a difficult time: the economy was heading south as a result of the dotcom bust and, just as there were signs that it might be on the mend, along came 9/11. What is more, the president can argue that the recession was short and shallow. The figures for growth out this week are expected to show the economy expanding at an an nual rate of about 4%. America has comfortably outpaced Europe over the past four years, but that says more about the weakness of Europe than the underlying health of the world's largest economy.</p> <p>In comparison to previous US economic cycles, the recovery has been weak. In the first 10 quarters of the upturn, annualised GDP growth averaged 3.4% In previous recoveries it averaged 5.4%. Over the same period, real wages and salaries rose at an annualised rate of 2.2%, way below the historical average of 10.6%. And there are fewer Americans in employment than when the upturn started.</p> <p>\"The jobless recovery since 2001 has created greater economic problems for Americans than the sluggish job performance of Europe in the 90s created for Europeans,\" according to Richard Freeman and William Rodgers in their analysis of what has gone wrong with the great American jobs machine. \"The United States has only a limited safety net for workers. Those who lose their jobs risk losing healthcare or seeing their family drop from the middle class into poverty. American welfare policy is full employment, not a social welfare state.\"</p> <p>Predictably, then, the failure to generate the number of jobs normally associated with an American economic recovery has seen an increase in the number of people living below the breadline. Poverty has risen and there are now 44 million Americans without health insurance.</p> <p>What may appear puzzling is that this has been accompanied by an increase in the share of the economy accounted for by consumption - which stands at a record level - and by a hefty increase in the trade deficit. If workers are not seeing real incomes rise very much, how come they are spending as though it's going out of fashion?</p> <p>The answer is that individuals have not just spent their tax cuts but been encouraged to borrow by the loose monetary policy of the Federal Reserve. \"Provided you've got a pulse, the banks here will lend you money,\" said Steve Newman, head of an organisation in Cleveland that seeks to find work for the unemployed.</p> <p><strong>Savings boost</strong><br> </p> <p>Domestic demand has been kept going by an unprecedented explosion in credit. Alan Greenspan has pumped trillions of dollars into the economy, and the extra liquidity has boosted asset prices. The stock market has recovered ground lost after 9/11 and the housing market has boomed. Consumers have remortgaged at low rates and simply carried on spending.</p> <p>There is an obvious limit to pumping up demand in this way and the US has reached it. The Fed is starting to raise rates in an attempt to reverse the decline in saving, and this heralds the end to the remortgaging boom. For the time being, households are trying to stave off the inevitable by increasingly plumping for variable rate products, which on average have interest rates two points below fixed rate products, but there have been signs in recent months that the squeeze on real incomes is having an effect.</p> <p>Fiscal policy has been expansionary, but in a spectacularly unhelpful way. Bush's tax cuts have helped those who are already rich. One example: America's lowest 20% income earners are paid an average $12,000 (\u00a36,500) a year. This year's tax cut would have put an extra $2 a week in their pockets. For the top 1%, the news was better. Already on more than $500,000 a year, they would have received an additional $39,000 from the government. Yet the poor person is much more likely to spend an additional dollar than a rich person. Economists call this a higher marginal propensity to consume, but it is really common sense. If you're on the breadline, you use an extra dollar to buy food or a new pair of shoes. If you're on $500,000, you already have everything you need, so you bank the tax cut.</p> <p>The counterpart to the US trade deficit is that countries in Asia - particularly China - are running huge surpluses. If America is consuming too much, China is investing too much. In the short term, this keeps prices of US imports low, but at the long-term expense of costing America jobs and of building up a colossal speculative bubble that will collapse as soon as the US takes action to reduce its trade deficit.</p> <p>Received wisdom is that the US economy is on the mend and the recovery - in Greenspan's words - will get traction. On this score, Bush is a classic Keynesian, using expansionary monetary and fiscal policy so the US can spend its way out of recession.</p> <p>An alternative view is that the economy has been grotesquely mismanaged over the past four years, as witnessed not just by the trade deficit and the job losses but the way Bush has squandered the budget surplus bequeathed by Clinton.</p> <p><strong>Client-conscious</strong><br> </p> <p>There is a third perspective. It is that Bush has finally buried the Republican party's reputation for fiscal prudence in favour of an approach to policy-making that dovetails with the conservative social views of his base. Michael Wolf wrote in the Spectator: \"The Republicans are the party of the Southern Baptist Conference. The Democrats are the party of Goldman Sachs.\" Kerry supporters such as Professor James Galbraith think this view is wrong. Bush, he says, doesn't have and never has had an economic policy other than to \"serve his clients\".</p> <p>The shortcomings of this approach are becoming evident. Over the next two days we will be looking at what they are.</p>",
  "George Bush has exploited the suffering of September 11 and turned back decades of efforts to make the world a safer place, the former president Jimmy Carter says in an interview with the Guardian published today. <p>Attacking Mr Bush and Tony Blair over Iraq, Mr Carter calls the war \"a completely unjust adventure based on misleading statements\". </p> <p>He also criticises Mr Bush for \"lack of effort\" on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and accuses him of abandoning nuclear non-proliferation initiatives championed by five presidents. </p> <p>The US \"suffered, in 9/11, a terrible and shocking attack ... and George Bush has been adroit at exploiting that attack, and he has elevated himself, in the consciousness of many Americans, to a heroic commander-in-chief, fighting a global threat against America,\" Mr Carter says. </p> <p>\"He's repeatedly played that card, and to some degree quite successfully. I think that success has dissipated. I don't know if it's dissipating fast enough to affect the election. We'll soon know.\" </p> <p>Mr Carter, 80, was president from 1977-1981, but did not win re-election amid the US hostage crisis in Iran. By comparison, support for Mr Bush's Iraq invasion is widespread, something Mr Carter attributes to a transformation in America's national mood. </p> <p>\"When your troops go to war, the prime minister or the president change overnight from an administrator, dealing with taxation and welfare and health and deteriorating roads, into the commander-in-chief,\" he says. \"And it's just become almost unpatriotic to describe Bush's fallacious and ill-advised and mistaken and sometimes misleading actions.\" </p> <p>Mr Bush and Mr Blair are blamed for helping to fuel the depth of anti-American feeling in the Islamic world. Denying any link between his handling of the Iranian crisis and the present threat, Mr Carter says: \"The entire Islamic world condemned Iran. Nowadays, because of the unwarranted invasion of Iraq by Bush and Blair, which was a completely unjust adventure based on misleading statements, and the lack of any effort to resolve the Palestinian issue, [there is] massive Islamic condemnation of the United States.\" </p> <p>American media organisations, he adds, \"have been cowed, because they didn't want to be unpatriotic. There has been a lack of inquisitive journalism. In fact, it's hard to think of a major medium in the United States that has been objective and fair and balanced, and critical when criticism was deserved\". </p> <p>On nuclear proliferation, the issue that the Democratic contender John Kerry has identified as the single most serious threat to national security, Mr Carter attacks Mr Bush for abandoning \"all of those long, tedious negotiations\" carried out by presidents Eisenhower, Kennedy, Nixon, Reagan and himself. </p> <p>In recent weeks he has also warned of the possibility of a new election fiasco in Florida. </p> <p>The two presidential candidates spent the weekend focusing their resources and words even more tightly on the small number of swing states considered crucial to the election on November 2. </p> <p>Mr Bush told supporters in Florida that \"despite ongoing violence, Iraq has an interim government. It's building up its own security forces. We're headed toward elections in January. You see, we're safer, America is safer with Afghanistan and Iraq on the road to democracy. We can be proud that 50 million citizens of those countries now live as free men and women\". </p> <p>Mr Carter's interview marks the UK publication of his book The Hornet's Nest, a story of the American revolutionary war and the first novel to be published by a former president. Ironically, he notes, those fighting for US independence could never have triumphed were it not for an alliance with the French.</p>",
  "Bill Clinton today made his first appearance on the campaign trail since his heart surgery seven weeks ago and urged voters to elect John Kerry as a president who \"wants you to think and hope\". <p>The former president told a boisterous rally in Philadelphia that Mr Kerry, the Democratic challenger, would be a champion of the middle classes who had been hit hard by the Republican administration of George Bush.</p> <p>Mr Clinton, who has been warned by doctors not to exert himself too much after his surgery, looked well as he walked out onto the stage in the biggest city in Pennsylvania, which is one of the key swing states that will settle the November 2 poll.</p> <p>His first words on stage were \"If this is not good for my heart I don't know what is.\"</p> <p>Mr Clinton said: \"From time to time, I was called the comeback kid. Well in eight days, John Kerry is going to make America the comeback country.\"</p> <p>He said that in four years of a Bush White House, 70,000 jobs had been lost in Philadelphia compared to a growth of 200,000 jobs when the \"last fella was president: me\". </p> <p>He said unemployment across the state was up 26%, compared to being up 25% in the first four years of his Democratic administration and that 333,000 people in the state had lost their health insurance. He said that under the Republicans the public got less cover for more money.</p> <p>He said that Mr Kerry's plans was to increase the numbers of police officers on the streets, to get the guns out of the communities. He would focus on the true threats facing America, and make fighting al-Qaida a priority. \"We still have six times as many troops in Iraq as we do in Afghanistan,\" the former president said. </p> <p>He described both Mr Kerry and Mr Bush as strong characters. But he said the Republicans did not want people to think and they wanted the public to be scared. </p> <p>Mr Clinton said that the Republicans had given \"two huge tax cuts to special interests and people with high incomes like me\" that hit the middle classes. \"John Kerry has a better plan,\" Mr Clinton said to huge applause. </p> <p>He paid tribute to Mr Kerry for his perseverance, saying that during the tough moments in his campaign he had \"just kept being John Kerry\" and had come back in the polls. </p> <p>Mr Kerry thanked Mr Clinton, who he said was loved by the American people. He said heart surgery was a \"big deal\" but that it was a tough job \"to keep Bill Clinton away from the campaign trail\". </p> <p>He revealed that when he went to see Mr Clinton in hospital the former president had promised him he would be back before election day to help Mr Kerry, \"Promise kept,\" Mr Kerry said. </p> <p>Mr Kerry said he had asked Mr Clinton before they took the stage what he had in common with Mr Bush. Mr Kerry said that Mr Clinton had said: \"In eight days ... we will both be former presidents\".</p>",
  "<p><br>A video image from the Bush campaign's 'Wolves' advertisement. Photograph: AP<br>Between now and election day an estimated $40m (\u00a322m) will be spent on television and radio advertising.</p> <p>The Kerry campaign has a series focused on \"hope\" and a \"fresh start\" for America; Bush's people are playing up the fear factor. One of the more recent ads - Wolves - showed a pack of the snarling beasts to represent the threats facing the US. The John Kerry-endorsing <a href=\"http://www.wolfpacksfortruth.org/index.html\">Wolfpacks for Truth</a> is shocked - others have mocked. <strong>New York Times</strong> columnist Maureen Dowd suggested a Democrat response ad could show goose-hunter Senator Kerry <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/24/opinion/24dowd.html\">turning his gun on the wolves</a>, while Wonkette is just plain <a href=\"http://www.wonkette.com/archives/bush-can-run-but-he-cant-hide-no-really-he-cant-like-secret-service-would-stop-him--024058.php\">baffled</a>.</p> <p>Didn't George Bush say this weekend that \"<a href=\"http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2004/oct/24/yehey/top_stories/20041024top5.html\">anyone who thinks we're fighting a metaphor</a>\" fails to understand the enemy?</p> <blockquote style=\"font-size:small\"> Eep! Does that mean that his new ad is more predictive than we thought? Those wolves aren't just terrorists but actual bloody-fanged monsters who just ate grandma? Oh, Jesus fuck \u2026 The war on terror really is bigger than we thought. First it's Osama, then the wolves. </blockquote> <p>To put the ad spend in a British context, Labour and the Tories spent only a million or so more on the last general election. And it doesn't work arguing the US is a vastly bigger country, nearly all the advertising will be directed at the swing states. So don't expect a break from the election if you just want to put your feet up in front of the television and live in Pennsylvania or Ohio. And try not to have nightmares about wolves.</p>",
  "<p>Staring at the polls too long can send you crazy.

  "A huge cache of 340 tonnes of conventional explosives has gone missing from a military facility that once played a key role in Saddam Hussein's efforts to build a nuclear bomb, the UN confirmed today. <p>The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Mohamed ElBaradei, will report on the materials' disappearance to the UN Security Council later today.</p> <p>According to a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/25/international/middleeast/25bomb.html?hp&amp;ex=1098763200&amp;en=fd35fdf4b6d46d61&amp;ei=5094&amp;partner=homepage\">report</a> in the New York Times, the IAEA had warned US officials to keep track of the cache, which had been monitored by UN weapons inspectors for many years. </p> <p>A spokeswoman for Dr ElBaradei did not comment on any warnings the IAEA had given in the past but she said it had received a declaration from the Iraqi Ministry of Science and Technology on October 10 that explosive material had gone missing. \"The most immediate concern here is that these explosives could have fallen into the wrong hands,\" she said. </p> <p>The cache of explosives missing from the sprawling al-Qaqaa facility, which is around 30 miles south of Baghdad, is so big it would need a fleet of around 40 large trucks to be transported. </p> <p>It was placed under US military control but has repeatedly been looted and the New York Times said as recently as yesterday the area was a 'no man's land'.</p> <p>IAEA inspectors pulled out of Iraq just before the 2003 invasion and have not yet been able to return, despite Dr ElBaradei's repeated urging that the experts be allowed back into the country to finish their work. </p> <p>Saddam was known to have used the site to make conventional warheads, and IAEA inspectors dismantled parts of his nuclear programme there before the 1991 Gulf war. Dr ElBaradei told the Security Council before the war that Iraq's nuclear programme was in disarray and that there was no evidence to suggest the country had revived efforts to build atomic weaponry. </p> <p>The missing explosives could be used to detonate a nuclear device, although anyone wishing to do so would have great difficulty obtaining the required designs and nuclear fuel. </p> <p>There are fears that such a large amount of explosives could still cause great damage if used by insurgents who have attacked coalition and Iraqi forces. Just a small amount of the explosives, mainly HMX (which stands for high melting point explosive) and RDX (rapid detonation explosive), are capable of shattering aeroplanes and destroying buildings. Less than a pound of a similar kind of explosive brought down the Pan Am Flight over Lockerbie in 1988. </p> <p>The New York Times reports that Iraqi officials warned the US coalition provisional authority in May 2004 that the explosives had probably been looted. </p> <p>The US national security adviser, Condoleezza Rice, was informed about the missing explosives last month but it was unclear if the US president, George Bush, had been told, the New York Times said. </p> <p>In Washington today, Democratic presidential hopeful John Kerry's campaign said the Bush administration \"must answer for what may be the most grave and catastrophic mistake in a tragic series of blunders in Iraq\". </p> <p>\"How did they fail to secure ... tonnes of known, deadly explosives despite clear warnings from the International Atomic Energy Agency to do so?\" senior Kerry adviser Joe Lockhart asked.</p> <p>One US official source indicated that the handover of power to the Iraqis in June this year and the growing insurgency had been a distraction. The official told the New York Times: \"It's not an excuse but a lot of things went by the boards.\"</p> <p>The Iraq Survey Group, the CIA task force that had led the fruitless search for Saddam's alleged weapons of mass destruction, has been tasked with finding the missing stockpile of explosives, the newspaper said. </p> <p>The nuclear agency pulled out of Iraq in 1998, and by the time it returned in 2002, it confirmed that 35 tonnes of HMX that had been placed under IAEA seal were missing. </p> <p>Since then it appears much more has been taken. The New York Times said that of roughly 10 bunkers where the explosives had been held, eight were intact and empty. The type of explosives that are missing are popular among militaries and terrorists because they are relatively safe and stable to transport as they do not explode if impacted.</p>",
  "Former US president Bill Clinton was expected to make his first election campaign appearance today since undergoing heart surgery, urging Americans to vote for Senator John Kerry. <p>Mr Clinton, who had a heart bypass operation just over six weeks ago, said he was determined to campaign for the Democratic challenger because of the \"profound\" importance of the election. </p> <p>He will appear alongside Mr Kerry in Philadelphia, the biggest city in the vital battleground state of Pennsylvania, with little over a week to go before the election. Mr Kerry and the US president, George Bush, are roughly neck-and-neck in the polls. </p> <p>Mr Clinton said doctors had advised him not to over-exert himself in the campaign but he told ABC News: \"I want to do this. Senator Kerry asked me to do it and I want to do it ... because it's close, and because I think it's important, and because the differences between the two candidates and the courses they will pursue in the next four years are so profound.\" </p> <p>He said he felt good although his chest was normally a \"little bit tender in the morning\". He said: \"I get up and start moving around and I feel better ... I just sleep and walk, read books, watch baseball, that's what I do.\" </p> <p>Mr Clinton said he and his wife, Hillary, were determined that he would keep his campaigning to a minimum. \"I talked to my doctors about it and they made some very helpful suggestions ... they said I should get wherever I'm going early in case I'm tired, so I can kind of regenerate.\" </p> <p>Mr Clinton said his wife \"didn't want me to do too much ... and I don't either\". </p> <p>He said he thought Mr Kerry could win but that it was very close and was one of the hardest elections to predict he could remember. \"Our country is divided culturally, pretty evenly now,\" Mr Clinton said. </p> <p>Mr Kerry said: \"I hope he brings strength of health and the excitement that Bill Clinton always brings to the campaign trail.\"</p> <p>In the latest ABC tracking poll, 49% of likely voters favour Mr Bush and 48% Mr Kerry, making it a dead heat within the poll's margin of error. However the figure did mark a comeback for Mr Kerry, who was lagging, 46% to 51% in the same poll for most of last week. </p> <p>Mr Kerry is hoping that the appearance of Mr Clinton will boost his ratings even further. The Democrat's challenger was targeting Pennsylvania because it is one of a handful of states likely to decide the outcome of the election. Polls in Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania are neck and neck. And the three states hold a large number of electoral college votes which the candidates must secure to claim victory. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the battle between Mr Kerry and Mr Bush to appear to be the strongest on terrorism continued. </p> <p>In remarks seized on by Mr Kerry, the president said in an interview on Fox television to be broadcast tonight that it was \"up in the air\" whether the US can ever be fully protected from another terrorist attack.</p> <p>Mr Kerry said at a rally yesterday in Florida: \"You make me president of the United States, we're going to win the war on terror ... it's not going to be up in the air whether or not we make America safe.\" </p> <p>Mr Bush's comment perhaps reflects what some commentators have described as his attempts to appear tough on terror at the same time as promoting the fear of it. </p> <p>The president said in the interview: \"We have to be right 100% of the time in disrupting any plot and they have to be right once.\" </p> <p>He said he was sure terrorists still considered disrupting the November 2 election, as they did with the Madrid train attacks, ahead of the Spanish election in March. </p> <p>But he said: \"I don't want to alarm anybody... there's nothing specific at this point ... we don't have actionable intelligence to say there's an attack, and of course if we did, we'd be moving heaven and earth to stop it.\"</p> <p>Asked earlier in the day on ABC whether he had considered the fact that he could lose on November 2, Mr Bush replied, \"I'm not there yet. I believe we're going to win and I'm campaigning as if we are going to win.\" </p> <p>Later, Mr Bush is expected to deliver a new campaign stump speech in Colorado, another closely contested state, charging that Mr Kerry has a limited vision of the war on terror that will not keep America safe. </p> <p>\"There will be new language. There are many different arguments to be made to make the same point,\" White House communications director Dan Bartlett said. </p> <p>Tomorrow, Mr Bush is expected to speak about the US economy, an area where Mr Kerry believes he is stronger. Mr Bush was expected to hail the impact of his tax cuts with a charge, denied by Kerry, that the Massachusetts senator would raise taxes on all Americans if elected.</p>",
  "For a cheese-eating surrender monkey, Guilhem Alandry is a brave man. A Frenchman, and plainly a bit of a lefty, Alandry is heading to George Bush's hometown of Crawford, Texas. Not just for a quick visit, not just to buy a Bush mug at a souvenir shop and head back out. Alandry wants to move in - temporarily - with a Crawford family and document their lives at a critical point in the town's history, the 2004 presidential election. <p>Alandry is one-fifth of Documentography, a London-based collective of photographers that will fan out across the US and capture the lives of five American families in the week before the election and its immediate aftermath. Guardian Unlimited will carry their project as part of our US election coverage. </p> <p>Only one of the photographers, the Brit Muzi Quawson, had a pre-arranged agreement to move in with a specific family. She will be in LaGrange, Georgia, living in a multi-generational household that runs the political spectrum from conservative to liberal. </p> <p>The others will be relying on the openness and hospitality of their host communities to find a family willing to live for a week with cameras, audio recordings and a foreigner with a possibly very different world view.</p> <p>Brazilian Eduardo Martino flew into San Diego on Wednesday, in search of a Hispanic family with military connections. Danish photographer Anna Kari - she came up with the idea for the project - left for Tallahassee, Florida on Thursday. And finally Magali Corouge is off to the battleground state of Ohio. </p> <p>Sitting in their cluttered, cosy Hackney flat, surrounded by souvenirs from trips to Africa, Alandry, Corouge and Kari are full of enthusiasm for the towns they hope will take them in. </p> <p>All three of them are typing away into their laptops as we chat. What was the name of that factory in Canton, Ohio that just laid off all those workers? Exactly how many people live in Crawford, Texas - is it 500 or 700? Tap, tap, tap. They have studied their target towns reverently and have constructed broad profiles of the types of families they hope will take them in for a week and a half. </p> <p>Corouge wants to document people affected by the 10% unemployment rate that has ravaged Canton. Most have lost their jobs in the last three or four years, she says. She hopes to find an extended family living together out of economic necessity, perhaps a working couple that have moved back in with their parents to make ends meet. But with just enough space left over to accommodate a sympathetic French photographer for a short time.</p> <p>Kari chose Tallahassee because it suffered most from governor Jeb Bush's move to purge criminals from the state's voter rolls before the last election. Thousands of Floridians were disenfranchised by lists that erroneously connected them with criminal records, and a disproportionate number of those voters were African-Americans likely to vote for Al Gore. \"I'm hoping to find someone upset about what happened four years ago, someone active in the community,\" says Kari.</p> <p>Alandry has wanted to visit Crawford since the French refused to join the invasion of Iraq. </p> <p>\"In Crawford they were the first to take up freedom fries and they really hated the French,\" he recalls almost fondly. But that was two years ago, and the people of Crawford have seen a nonstop parade of international VIPs and grown accustomed to media tents on their main street. </p> <p>He talks excitedly about the German immigrants that founded the community in the 1800s and the modern conflict of Democrats and Republicans coexisting in a small town made famous when George and Laura Bush bought a ranch there in 1999. </p> <p>Documentography hopes its project will counterbalance the mainstream media coverage of the elections, which has drowned out the sound of ordinary Americans discussing the impact of politics on their lives.</p> <p>\"I think political debate is a lot more aggressive in the US; it's like a stageshow. People are very radical in their opinions. Or maybe we don't hear from the middle ground so much,\" Kari says. \"I feel like I have to go down to local paper level to hear people's voices.\"</p> <p>Each photographer will post 10 pictures each day on Guardian Unlimited, along with accompanying text and three minutes of sound. </p> <p>\"It could be two neighbours talking about who they'll vote for, or ambient sound from a football stadium,\" Alandry explains. \"We won't constantly be asking the families, 'Who are you voting for? What about Iraq?' It will be much more about daily life, about sitting around a barbecue with a beer.\"</p> <p>Assuming the famous Texan hospitality comes to Alandry's aid and lands him with a home in Crawford for the week, he is still worried about what will happen the day after the election.</p> <p>\"If Kerry wins, I don't know what will happen to Crawford. For that village it is a big deal,\" he says. Crawford, he notes, was a dying community before the Bush ranch put it on the map. His presidency has created an unexpected revenue stream, one that might be cut off if the White House changes hands. </p> <p>In the meantime, though, Alandry just needs a nice Texan family to feed him up.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> The Documentography project will run from Tuesday October 26 to election day.

  "<p><strong>Independent film-makers</strong> are celebrating after President Bush signed a bill which gives tax breaks to films made in the US. Many believe that this will draw funds back into independent films. The bill follows almost a decade of lobbying the US government to pass legislation which would restrain the numbers of films made overseas.</p> <p><strong>LL Cool J</strong> is to star opposite Queen Latifah in a remake of Last Holiday, to be directed by Wayne Wang. Production on the film, a remake of the 1950 comedy, which starred Alec Guinness, should begin next month in New Orleans.

  "George Bush and John Kerry today enter the final week of a presidential race that is as deadlocked now as it was six months ago. <p>With the country polarised and only a relative handful of voters still undecided, the campaigns have three final tasks: focus on a few pivotal states, mobilise their supporters, and get ready to challenge the outcome.</p> <p>Focusing the campaign involves the hard decision to switch resources from the states they might like to win to those realistically within their grasp. The candidates will narrow their focus to those few battlegrounds, where voters will be subjected to an even heavier monsoon of television advertising by the campaigns and their political surrogates.</p> <p>Both sides acknowledge that all that frantic activity has rapidly diminishing returns. The unfortunate residents of Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania have probably seen all the political advertising they can stand.</p> <p>But what matters most this week is mobilisation: the battle to get a bigger proportion of your supporters to the polls than the other side.</p> <p>The Democrats have long prided themselves on their get-out-the-vote prowess, but over the past four years Karl Rove, the president's chief strategist, has built a centralised machine, precinct by precinct, that could erase that traditional Democratic advantage.</p> <p>Broadly speaking, mobilisation has been the game plan throughout modern electoral history, but the searing experience of the 2000 recount has introduced a new element, that could once more make the difference between victory and defeat: the readiness for legal challenges.</p> <p>The Republicans have recruited thousands of volunteers to deploy at polling stations in Democratic districts in swing states to check the credentials of the flood of newly-registered voters expected to turn up on November 2.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Democrats claim to have some 10,000 lawyers on standby to ensure their supporters, particularly new immigrants and minorities, get to vote, and to get to court quickly to declare challenges before results are officially announced.</p> <p>It seems likely that what appeared a freak phenomenon in 2000 could become a regular occurrence in an evenly split nation, with the final decisive stage of the battle taking place after election day is over.</p> <p>The sense of deja-vu is increasing already, as the contest boils down to the same small circle of states as last time.</p> <p>The Kerry campaign, buoyed by the southern charms of its vice-presidential candidate, John Edwards, had ambitions only a few months ago of mounting a serious challenge in traditionally conservative heartland states like Virginia and North Carolina. Those ambitions have been abandoned and the Kerry camp has also pulled its forces out of Missouri, repositioning them in the remaining dozen states still in play.</p> <p>Similarly the Bush campaign has closed its operation in Washington state, where it had hoped to score a surprise win. But the president is enjoying a surprise surge in Michigan, a blue-collar, traditionally Democrat bastion, which is now back on the swing-state list.</p> <p>If the shift to Mr Bush on election day is big enough to win a state like Michigan, then the game is up for Senator Kerry in any case.</p> <p>But assuming he can beat the president there, he will have to win two of the three big remaining battleground states: Florida, Pennsylvania and Ohio, to take the presidency</p> <p>It is a question of arithmetic. The goal is to amass 270 votes in the electoral college, a body consisting of delegates, or electors from each state, whose numbers are roughly proportionate to that state's population. In all the big swing states, electors are allotted on a winner-take-all basis.</p> <p>At the moment, both John Kerry and George Bush can count on about 200 electoral college votes each, leaving 135 up for grabs. Of those, Florida accounts for 27, Pennsylvania 21, and Ohio 20.</p> <p>Four years ago, Al Gore was trailing by a few points in most national polls, just as John Kerry is today, but on election day itself, as Democrats never tire of reminding the country, Mr Gore won half a million more votes.</p> <p>That last-minute turnaround, Republicans agree, was a direct result of the Democrats' superior capacity for mobilisation, relying on foot-soldiers from the unions, environmental groups and the local political machine. This year the effort has been augmented by liberal groups like America Coming Together, which have exploited a loophole in the campaign finance laws to raise money independently of the parties and their fundraising limits.</p> <p>This year, however, the Democrats will be matched by a meticulously constructed network of Republican volunteers in every voting precinct, in which local \"precinct captains\" have been set ambitious goals for recruiting voters and transporting them to the polls on election day.</p> <p>Yet the Republican machine is untested. Its ability to deliver on its promise to match the Democratic turnout will only become clear when the dust settles after election day.</p> <p>It is quite possible that the dust will not settle for quite some time after November 2. The Democrats are convinced that if they had been better prepared for the court battles that erupted in Florida, with more lawyers on hand to fly down to the flashpoints in Miami, Palm Beach, Tampa and Tallahassee, Mr Gore would have won the day. They are not about to make the same mistake again.</p> <p>But the Republicans are ready for them, convinced that the Democrats have bent the rules in the race to register new voters.</p> <p>Rather than calm denouement that polling day has traditionally been, next Tuesday is likely to witness skirmishes between lawyers and activists on both sides at polling stations across the nation. Those battles will inevitably spill into the courtrooms and stay there, as the conservative columnist George Will put it, until \"Bush or Kerry finally gets 270 electoral votes, perhaps in May\".</p>",
  "President Bush's campaign in Florida, which handed him victory in 2000, took a blow yesterday when two of the state's newspapers failed to endorse his candidacy. <p>The Orlando Sentinel, which has not endorsed a Democrat for president since Lyndon Johnson, opted for John Kerry.</p> <p>\"This president has utterly failed to fulfil our expectations,\" an editorial said.</p> <p>\"We turn now to his Democratic challenger, Senator John Kerry, with the belief that he is more likely to meet the hopes we once held for Mr Bush.\"</p> <p>Another Florida newspaper, the Tampa Tribune, chose not to endorse either candidate. It is the first time since 1952 that the paper has not backed the Republican candidate for the presidency.</p> <p>Campaigning on Sunday in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Mr Kerry sought to address the criticisms directed at him by some Catholic bishops, who have attacked him for his support of abortion rights.</p> <p>\"I know there are some bishops who have suggested that as a public official I must cast votes or take public positions - on issues like a woman's right to choose and stem cell research - that carry out the tenets of the Catholic church,\" he said.</p> <p>He added: \"I love my church; I respect the bishops; but I respectfully disagree. My task, as I see it, is not to write every doctrine into law. That is not possible or right in a pluralistic society.\"</p> <p>In Colorado, another swing state, the Denver Post endorsed President Bush, citing the \"war on terror\" as the crucial issue. In 2000 it backed Al Gore, but despite misgivings about Mr Bush's performance since taking office, it decided to endorse Mr Bush.</p> <p>\"Decisiveness is a crucial characteristic in the showdown with the nation's elusive enemies,\" an editorial in the paper said. \"We believe he meets the test, and we aren't sure about John Kerry.\"</p> <p>In a pre-recorded television interview due to be broadcast today, Mr Bush pushed home his message that America needed to stay on the offensive in the war on terror.</p> <p>\"Whether or not we can be ever fully safe is up - you know, is up in the air,\" he told Fox News. \"I would hope we could make it a lot more safe by staying on the offensive.\"</p> <p>The Washington Post came out for Mr Kerry yesterday, albeit with reservations.</p> <p>\"On balance,\" the paper said, \"we believe Mr Kerry, with his promise of resoluteness tempered by wisdom and open-mindedness, has staked a stronger claim on the nation's trust to lead for the next four years.</p> <p>\"We do not view a vote for Mr Kerry as a vote without risks. But the risks on the other side are well known, and the strengths Mr Kerry brings are considerable.</p> <p>\"He pledges both to fight in Iraq and to reach out to allies; to hunt down terrorists, and to engage without arrogance the Islamic world. These are the right goals, and we think Mr Kerry is the better bet to achieve them.\"</p> <p>Mr Kerry's camp claimed that 113 daily newspapers with a total of 14.4m readers had endorsed the Kerry-Edwards ticket, 27 of which endorsed Mr Bush in 2000 - including Mr Bush's local Crawford paper, the Lone Star Iconoclast.</p> <p>Mr Bush had received endorsements from only 70 daily newspapers with circulation of 8.6m.</p> <p>Former president Bill Clinton, who has been recovering from a quadruple heart bypass operation, is due to join the Kerry campaign for an event in Philadelphia today.</p>",
  "The Americans have asked us to send 850 troops to one of the hardest-fought areas of Iraq. The response of the British left has been disgraceful. <p>A significant proportion of Labour backbenchers has argued that we should refuse - for two reasons which seem almost as dishonourable and removed from reality as George Bush's reasons for starting the war in the first place.</p> <p>I didn't want this war to start, and I expect it to end in ignominious retreat from a devastated country. But we're there now. And if our army is to fight at all, it should be fighting in the front line - as much of it already is. The purpose of this redeployment is to free up the American troops for their impending assault on Falluja. This is bad news for the hapless residents of Falluja; it's also a confirmation of bad news about the American army. If it is really so overstretched after 18 months of victory that it cannot find an extra 600 fighting soldiers (the rest are support troops), then it shouldn't have gone there in the first place. But we all know that now.</p> <p>The question is what is to be done to get out of Iraq. Hanging back, and claiming that we don't mind the war too much so long as we don't get our soldiers killed, cannot be the answer. Yet that is the position that much of the left has argued itself into.</p> <p>The first objection of many MPs seems to be that our troops will die as a result. They will. But that's still not a good enough reason to refuse the American request. Anyone who argues for the move must face the fact that it will mean the loss of British soldiers who probably would not otherwise die.</p> <p>The generals and politicians involved know this already. I suspect it weighed more on the politicians than the generals. It's not that generals are harder hearted; they probably feel the deaths of soldiers more. But they know what their men joined up for, and in a volunteer army men join to fight, and to take the risk of being killed.</p> <p>As far as one can judge from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,,1326609,00.html \">Audrey Gillan's wonderful articles on the territorial army in Iraq</a>, the soldiers themselves are rewarded, not punished, with dangerous deployments. That's where the promotion is found. All they ask is that this be done in a just cause, in a way directed with reasonable competence.</p> <p>You may argue that the army in Iraq is taking part in an unjust war, directed with startling incompetence. It's a hard case to argue against. In an ideal world, we shouldn't be in Iraq at all. But we are. We have to make the best of the mess, and that means hoping that the elections in January will produce some kind of government that has a chance of bringing order and then legitimacy to the country, and of averting civil war. The elections may yet collapse. Without the occupying armies, they won't take place at all.</p> <p>This is pretty much Kofi Annan's position: the war was unjust, but the international community must now deal with the consequences and help Iraq away from anarchy. That means soldiers getting shot at, and shooting back. Unless the left renounces war altogether as an instrument of policy, it has to be prepared for soldiers to die and to kill - often in rather stupid situations.</p> <p>The worst argument advanced against the redeployment was that it would be helpful to the Bush re-election campaign. If anyone really thinks that British troop movements greatly affect the minds of American voters, they shouldn't be let anywhere near foreign policy. It is yet another example of the grotesque overestimation of our importance in the scheme of things which helped get us into this mess in the first place.</p> <p>The Germans or the French would be very wrong to announce that they were sending some troops of their own to the war under the inspired leadership of President Bush. That might help him get re-elected. But we can no longer make that gesture, and merely shifting our forces so that we take some otherwise American casualties won't be noticed at all in the US campaign.</p> <p>There is one final, cynical twist to this argument. Low political cunning would suggest that the opponents of this move want Tony Blair out of office and punished for the war. That is far more likely to happen if every week the papers are filled with stories of fresh British casualties in George Bush's war. If Mr Blair wants to write \"home by Christmas\" on his tombstone, is it really the job of the opposition to stop him?</p> <p>* Andrew Brown is the author of The Darwin Wars: The Scientific War for the Soul of Man and In the Beginning Was the Worm: Finding the Secrets of Life in a Tiny Hermaphrodite.

  "On October 11, four co-founders of a web-based youth activist group gathered in a small apartment in Manhattan for their weekly meeting. Chairs were pulled into a circle, and iPods and cellphones were dropped onto a wooden trunk-cum-coffee table. The attendants were well-groomed and collegiate looking. Wheat Thins and Oreos were going around. The host of the meeting, a 23-year-old publicity assistant named Julie Binder, sat barefoot on the floor, occasionally tapping out notes on a laptop. <p>The night's agenda was finding a venue and sponsors for the group's election-night party, and with just over two weeks until November 2, the mood was serious. They considered bars called APT, Piano and Happy Ending. The space would have to be large but cosy, hip but relaxed, and it would need to have a television for watching the election results come in. Also, added Peter Koechley, a 23-year-old Columbia grad, it should be someplace \"where it's easy to have sex where no one notices.\" The others nodded in agreement. </p> <p>The party in question would be the climax (if you will) of <a href=\"http://www.votergasm.org\">votergasm.org</a> a non-partisan activist group whose website encourages \"young people everywhere to have sex with voters on election night, and to withhold sex from non-voters until the next presidential election.\" Votergasm also features racy voting-themed photo spreads and a game in which players must guess a voter's party affiliation based solely on the person's head shot. The group's goal, according to the Votergasm home page, is to \"send 100,000 first-time 18 to 25 year old voters to polls for the 2004 elections, and to catalyse 250,000 orgasms by the morning of November 3.\" </p> <p>A joke, right? Not really, insists the group's 23-year-old publicist, Michelle Collins, a chatty, ponytailed Barnard grad who works as a legal assistant. Collins explained that the group was founded on the belief that young Americans are failing their country in two important respects: They are not voting and not having enough sex. \"If there's anything that's really going to speak to America's youth, it's saying that voting is as important as sex, as fun, as American,\" says Collins. \"Take part in both things; you know, be a patriot, be patriotic.\" </p> <p>The premise may sound convoluted, but so far the Votergasm plan seems to be working. Since launching on September 4, the site has received more than 516,000 unique visitors (nearly 20,000 unique visitors per day, recently). More than 25,000 people have pledged to vote and have sex on election day, and more than 1,000 have clicked on the site's voter registration link. Last month, Votergasm.org was targeted by Rush Limbaugh, who poked fun at the site, and called for his listeners to shut it down by overwhelming the home page with thousands of simultaneous hits. (Hordes of Rush fans succeeded in doing so, but the site was up again in a matter of hours.) \"Me and Rush Limbaugh having a back and forth. I never thought I'd say those words,\" laughs Collins. Getting younger voters to the polls is particularly important in this year's neck-and-neck election. A recent Newsweek poll shows the youth vote to be largely up for grabs. MTV has been trying to appeal to this key demographic with its Choose or Lose 2004 campaign and the mission of P. Diddy's Citizen Change: Vote or Die organisation is to make voting \"hot, sexy and relevant\" to Americans aged 18 to 30. </p> <p>But Votergasm and other organisations are taking \"hot and sexy\" to a whole new level. One group of young activists recently formed a pornography company called Porn for Progress and just released their first movie, \"Fahrenheit 69: The Porn for Kerry DVD.\" A hardcore skin flick that also strives for social commentary, \"Fahrenheit 69\" is described by its creators as \"the world's first Pornlitical satire.\" The film features X-rated characters with familiar names, such as pundit \"Ann Cunter,\" a greased-up, writhing blonde who so loves guns that she impales herself on one for the camera. </p> <p>Sitting at a downtown New York cafe, the producer and financial backer of \"Fahrenheit 69\", who goes by the name \"Dick Tater\", explained how he and two college buddies first thought of the project during a three-way phone conversation. \"We were kind of mulling things over: Bush sucks, and we hope Kerry wins, and we haven't done anything interesting lately, and I've always loved porn.\" Like that, the trio decided to start a \"socially conscious\" porn company and to donate all profits to pro-Kerry grass-roots organisations. Within weeks, they had worked out a budget, written scripts, bought costumes, and hired actors. The film was shot in Florida over four days, with \"Tater,\" a 23-year-old Wharton grad who refused to give his real name, fluttering behind the scenes, making sure the lines were right, and occasionally holding a boom mike. </p> <p>\"The thing about us,\" Tater said, sounding very earnest, \"is that we want to make a difference. We're trying to be the Ben and Jerry of porn, to make porn that has a message, that's of much higher quality and much more interesting than other porn.\" And while Tater is under no illusion that \"Fahrenheit 69\" will throw the election, he feels confident that its satirical message will remind young viewers of Bush's indiscretions, and hopefully motivate them to vote. Maybe college kids \"who see the character Jorge Bush lubing himself up with Iraqi oil will look at that and think, yeah, what a schmuck, we just went to war for oil,\" he says. </p> <p>An even more hands-on effort is <a href=\"http://www.fthevote.com\">FTheVote.com</a> a website that encourages \"sexy liberals\" to seduce and have sex with conservatives in exchange for their partner's promise to vote against Bush. FTheVote.com (not to be confused with Fuck the Vote, which discourages voting in elections altogether and has nothing to do with sex) features photos of volunteer liberal \"models\" who offer their bodies to would-be Bush voters. \"All you need to be armed with are your sexy progressive values, a razor-sharp wit, your genitalia, and a mindset that doesn't mind taking one for the team,\" the site advises. FTheVote also provides volunteers with a downloadable contract (\"I, the undersigned, acknowledge that in exchange for physical affection ... from the co-signee, I will cast my vote for any candidate other than George W. Bush in the upcoming 2004 presidential election\"). Since its July 4 launch, FTheVote has received more than 1.8 million unique visitors, and a West Coast branch of the group has formed. </p> <p>Like Votergasm.org and Porn for Progress, FTheVote is decidedly playful, while also being serious about political activism. Nathan Martin, a 27-year-old arts professor in Pittsburgh who launched FTheVote with his friends at the media arts group Carbon Defence League, says that he started the site as a joke. But beneath FTheVote's goofiness is a profound disillusionment. Aside from hoping to \"oust Bush from office,\" Martin says, the site was born of a frustration with American politics in general, including \"the disappearance of any progressive values from the left's agenda.\" </p> <p>Perhaps the most startling fact about FTheVote is that many people seem to be taking the site's challenge seriously. Martin has received about 100 signed FTheVote contracts, and has heard from more than 200 other sex traders by e-mail. One such volunteer is Chad Vollrath, a 28-year-old English teacher in Pittsburgh. Vollrath says that he was already platonic friends with the Bush-leaning voter he slept with, but the two had long been attracted to one another. \"It was a way to, I guess, transgress a boundary in our relationship that hadn't been transgressed at that point,\" he says. But his interest wasn't only prurient. Vollrath is a fervent Kerry supporter, and wanted to score one more vote for his candidate. He feels confident that the woman - who now has another boyfriend - will stick to her promise. \"I would probably be somewhat hurt if after the election she said, 'Oh, I voted for Bush.' But I can't see that happening.\" </p> <p>FTheVote and its ilk may be capturing the attention of college-age voters, but can reducing the presidential election into a big, flirty, subterranean orgy really be considered progress? Martin of FTheVote says yes. \"How could we tarnish a system that's already so tarnished?\" he asks. Votergasm's Michelle Collins says that combining sex with American politics is only natural to her generation. \"You look at Clinton, you look at Governor McGreevy ... sex does play a humongous role in politics,\" says Collins. \"The only problem ... is that it's always a negative role.\" </p> <p>Whether Votergasm, Porn for Progress and FTheVote will have any impact on the election is debatable. But these activists get points for being inventive, spirited and, during this year's super-antagonistic race, for not taking themselves too seriously. When asked what she hoped to achieve through Votergasm, Michelle Collins thought for a few seconds and said, \"I want to, like, speak to my generation.\" She stopped herself, blushed, and covered her mouth. \"Oh my God, if I turn into a human Pepsi can here, please, forgive me.\" </p> <p> <b>\u00b7</b> Jennifer Fried, an MFA student at Bennington Writing Seminars, is a lawyer living in Brooklyn</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> This article has been provided by Salon through a special arrangement with Guardian Newspapers Limited<br> \u00a9 Salon.com 2004</p>",
  "<p><strong>1. The Environmental IQ: profiling the impact of products </strong><br> This idea is a truly timely one: it proposes a scheme in which the impact (or 'footprint') of products on the world, in terms of sustainability, fairness and health, is provided for consumers to view. The product profiles could be accessible online, or the 'EIQ' could simply be put as a figure on the packaging; both systems would empower customers to make rounded, accurate ethical choices. So, fruit that is grown on deforested land, picked by seasonal workers with no rights, and which is transported for thousands of miles for sale would have a low IQ; which seems appropriate enough.</p> <p><strong>2. Hibernation Day: an international duvet day for the world</strong><br> There has been something of a laziness renaissance in the past few years, and we've covered research that says that idleness is the key to longer life, power-napping projects in schools and a campaign for greater slacking rights (which was predictably low-key and lethargic). This idea is very much in the same vein, although I like this one particularly for its sheer ambition: that around the world, \"no businesses, schools, restaurants or shopping areas would be permitted to open\" on the day. A little dogmatic for a chilled-out idea, perhaps, but who wouldn't be ready to join in?</p> <p><strong>3. Fame Lottery: people get their 15 minutes, money goes to charity</strong><br> In a world obsessed with celebrity and fame, what better way to raise money for charity than with the Fame Lottery? It works like this: the lottery is run by a non-profit organisation who take a percentage of the proceeds to support their work. People buy the tickets in the hope of being the lottery's spokesperson that month, which would involve spots on TV, radio and the internet. So the charity gets much-needed cash, and the lottery-winner gets their ego tickled with media appearances. And the saddest thing of all? It might just work.</p> <p><strong>4. A city/country house swap network to house everyone efficiently</strong><br> Just as one can see the hand of Big Brother in the Fame Lottery, so the spectre of countless property programmes looms over this idea. The problem is that many people are buying second homes in rural locations, inflating the prices beyond the means of the locals and leaving communities half-empty for much of the year. And the solution? A swap network of city and country houses, so city slickers could escape for the weekend, while those in rural areas come up to the big smoke for their own mini-break. No need to buy, no empty villages, and nary a mention of the dreaded words 'crash pad'.</p> <p><strong>5. Lottery entry slips to have a tick box for 10% to charity</strong><br> One of the simplest ideas in the book and one of the best. Put simply, each lottery ticket should have a tick box which says next to it \"If I win over \u00a3....., I will give 10% of my winnings to charity\". There could even be a space provided for the specific charity the person wants to give to. Obviously, clear terms and conditions would be needed, but the money could be dispensed by the lottery administrators direct to ensure it reached the intended organisation. Not only would this give an extra charitable angle to the current system, but it would also help change the wayward perception that all the lottery money goes to fund refugee groups/athletes/museums/football kits (delete as applicable).</p> <p><strong>6. A proportion of defence spending to tackle the causes of terrorism</strong><br> This is one of those 'if only' ideas that make so much sense but are, to the jaded world-watcher, thoroughly unlikely to happen. Essentially, it contends that 10% of G8 countries' defence spending should be diverted into a UN (or other) development programme. The programme would aim to address the economic, political, social and religious reasons behind terrorism: a different kind of pre-emptive action, and one that would surely have better results. The campaign starts here. Interestingly, our biggest ever influx of social inventions came after the events of September 11 (including the shortest ever idea submitted to us: \"Fight terrorism: fly naked\"), and people's ideas shone with positivity amongst the pervading gloom of that time. </p> <p><strong>7. Heavy parking fines (but only for persistent transgressors) </strong><br> Trebling or quadrupling parking fines is the idea here, but only for those who persistently cross the line (or both yellow ones). Alongside this, measures would be introduced so that drivers could claim back one parking fine when renewing their road tax. As a result, occasional transgressors would not be unduly punished, whereas those who constantly get tickets would have a substantial incentive to stop doing so. This might seem drastic, but not as excessive as the mayor of Ecatepec in Mexico, who recently abolished parking tickets altogether in an effort to reduce police corruption in the city.</p> <p><strong>8. Charging the candidates for political apathy</strong><br> We've had countless ideas submitted to encourage more people to vote: drive-through voting, free beer for voters, discounts in shops with polling cards, and even voting rights from birth. This one stands out because it combines the need to get a disillusioned public involved with our wish for politicians to become more accountable. Essentially, if the turnout is below a certain level (say, 60%), the election in that area would be re-run at the expense of the candidates involved who, in the words of our social inventor, \"have clearly failed miserably to motivate the voters\". Costs of the re-run would be proportional to the number of votes cast. A further suggestion, which could be implemented in tandem, is that every vote from someone under 23 should count double: that might also prove to be a substantial cat amongst some wildly flapping pigeons.</p> <p><strong>9. A focused eco-tax on using animals in product marketing</strong><br> A great piece of simple creative thinking in evidence here: companies who use animals in their marketing and promotion should have to contribute something to preserving or helping the animal in question. Esso would have to contribute to a tiger reserve, Andrex to a dogs home, PG Tips to chimpanzee welfare and so on. It needn't necessarily be a huge amount but seeing as the companies profit from using the animals, it seems fair to give something back, and it may even prove to be a useful marketing exercise for the companies involved.</p> <p><strong>10. Using cartoons to assess middle management problems</strong><br> The theory behind this idea is that if an employee has a Dilbert (or other) cartoon up on their wall or computer, then the organisation is likely to have the problem it details. In larger organisations, therefore, one could total up the number of such cartoons and come to a figure (total number of cartoons divided by number of employees) on what might be termed 'The Dilbert Scale'. This would give a completely unscientific, but quite amusing way of comparing middle management problems in various organisations. </p> <p> These social inventions came from: </p> <p>1.

  "Susan Dzieduszycka-Suinat is pumped. Two weeks ago, sitting in an internet cafe on Munich's Odeonplatz, the software marketer who crafted a hugely successful voter registration website, pulls up numbers that show a remarkable spike in Americans overseas mobilising to defeat George W Bush. Between her site and another out of Hong Kong, Democrats have registered 140,000 new voters, 40% of them from swing states - and that is just the tip of the iceberg. Americans abroad, roused to a boiling fury by a Bush doctrine that has smeared America's good name across the globe, are looking like the \"silent swing vote\" in several key battleground states. Overseas registration for both parties is up by 400% over 2000; estimates put the tally of possible civilian votes as high as 2 million. <p>Then the panicked emails start flooding in. Today, less than two weeks before the tightest presidential race in memory, untold thousands of overseas voters still have not received their ballots - and clearly won't be able to get them back in time. Late primaries and legal challenges to Ralph Nader's appearance on the ballot delayed mailings from half the battleground states. In swing states, including Florida, Ohio and New Mexico, different versions of the ballot have gone out, sowing wild confusion. In Pennsylvania alone, at least three versions were mailed overseas, in successive, chaotic waves - with Nader and without him, plus a blank one-size-fits-all ballot with no names at all. </p> <p>Activists now fear that huge numbers of Americans overseas - both military and civilian - may be as disenfranchised as they were in 2000, when anywhere from 10 to 40% of overseas ballots, depending on the county, just plain never showed up. But, far from helping civilians, the Federal Voting Assistance Programme (FVAP) has dragged its feet. A small liaison office based in the Pentagon, the FVAP provides voting materials to the departments of defence and state for soldiers and civilians abroad, and preaches overseas election law to thousands of local election officials back home. </p> <p>The Government Accountability Office excoriated the agency for losing thousands of overseas votes in 2000, but the FVAP insists it has corrected its problems this year. Frustrated civilian advocates, however, say the FVAP remains biased and ineffective. Despite reforms, they attest, it still has not shaken its Pentagon roots: It spends the bulk of its energy getting out a heavily Republican vote among half a million service people - but has failed the far greater numbers of civilians (an estimated 4 million, by most counts) who tend to vote a different way. </p> <p>The tsunami of overseas civilian voters this year has only made the inequity more glaring. The agency was overwhelmed by a flood that has clogged its fax lines, telephones and email. It has blocked access to its website to civilian voters abroad, given military voters access to electronic ballot-request systems that civilians cannot use, and subcontracted sensitive election work to a company with strong Republican ties. For months, it failed to heed requests from the state department to post an emergency substitute ballot on its website that will mainly help civilians living far from consulates and military bases. Finally, on October 21, with only 12 days till the election, it will post a downloadable version of the federal write-in absentee ballot, known as FWAB: a last-ditch device intended for the precise situation in which thousands of overseas voters now find themselves. </p> <p>Those who've busted their guts to get out the overseas civilian vote on both sides are relieved but still angry. \"Considering 2000 and the fact everybody knew this was going to be a close race, they should have seen it coming,\" says Joan Hills, co-chair of Republicans Abroad. \"The obstacles that have been thrown up are incredible,\" says Jim Brenner, executive director of AOK (Americans Overseas for Kerry), an arm of the Democratic National Committee. Samuel F Wright, director of the Military Voting Rights Project of the National Defence Committee, and a Navy Reserve officer who has spent 25 years observing the FVAP, says: \"Frankly, I'm not impressed with them. They're sort of going through the motions. I've been pinging on DoD for four years that this is the perfect situation for the emergency ballot.\" Voters who have requested but not received their ballot by now can dispatch the FWAB in its place. (If the real ballot subsequently arrives, election officials are required to discard the FWAB and count the regular ballot.) </p> <p>A million hard copies of the FWAB have been sent to military bases in Germany and Asia and to the troops in Iraq and Afghanistan - two for every member of the military, Wright says - who surely deserve them. But on the civilian side, the record is spottier. The state department, charged with helping civilians overseas, ordered its consulates and embassies to stockpile the form. But Democrats Abroad reports that many have been caught short-handed and that direct voter requests to the FVAP have gone unfulfilled. In one pathetic twist, employees of DaimlerChrysler in Stuttgart had to beg forms from the military at the gate of the base last week, a voting officer said. </p> <p>Because so much hangs on key states, and on the possibly widespread use of an untested, little-known ballot, the potential for disaster is enormous. \"If this election is close, 2000 is going to look like a cakewalk,\" says Margo Miller, a London-based lawyer for AOK. \"It's going to be so messy in so many places, the fact that the FWAB hasn't been easier to get is inexcusable.\" </p> <p>The Pentagon responds that the two major parties began asking for the online FWAB only in late September and that it has moved \"mountains of bureaucracy\" to get the form online. Starting now, the tiny bureau of 14 civil servants in suburban Virginia will get the word out to election officials in 3,142 American counties that the downloaded version of the write-in ballot is good to go. </p> <p>But the programme's record does not inspire much confidence. Indeed, voters contacting officials to ask about the ballot have been shocked at the ignorance they've encountered. In Nepal, one embassy worker said the ballot could be mailed from the United States, which it cannot; in Chester County, Pennsylvania, an election supervisor had no idea what it was. Says Wright of the Military Voting Rights Project: \"Nobody has ever heard of it. The FVAP does show up at meetings and presentations, but I bet a lot of the 5,000 election officials don't go to those meetings, judging from the very basic questions we get back.\" </p> <p>While waiting for the FVAP to act, both parties gyrated over the internet. AOK put up its own version online with the disclaimer that no one knew if such ballots would be accepted; Democrats Abroad and the two main registration websites did not. Republicans Abroad then snitched the AOK form, without the disclaimer, and put it on its site, only to shamefacedly pull it off when told that, until the FVAP formally approved it, nobody could use the darn thing. AOK finally sent out 25,000 hard copies at its own expense to voters from swing states who'd signed up on the Overseas Vote 2004 website. </p> <p>The overarching problem is the scant resources allotted civilian voters, who outnumber the military overseas by at least eight to one. While all applaud the goal of making sure men and women fighting for our country can exercise their right to vote, civilians point out that they are Americans, too. And the FVAP has a history of favouring the military, not least because the department of defence has a captive, easily identified audience and far more money and muscle than the state department. Citizens abroad are far harder to find than soldiers: Embassies have direct contact only with a small minority of those who have registered to be alerted and evacuated in case of a disaster - though one might call mass disenfranchisement a disaster of another degree. </p> <p>Highly publicised missteps this year have hardly restored faith in the FVAP. Civilian voters still have trouble getting through to the agency and are barred from the email ballot request-and-delivery website that is available to soldiers from ten states. More worryingly, a pilot email voting system signed on to by Missouri, Utah and North Dakota, in which soldiers can email ballots to a contractor that then faxes those ballots to local jurisdictions, is being operated by Omega Technologies, headed by a former Republican Party donor, according to the New York Times. </p> <p>The Times also reports that earlier this week two Democratic members of Congress, Henry Waxman of California and Carolyn B Maloney of New York, asked the Government Accountability Office to investigate the FVAP. Among their concerns is that the agency's online ballot-retrieval system is not open to most civilians abroad. </p> <p>Miller, the AOK lawyer, says the FVAP, which moved only two years ago from the Pentagon department that buys soap and toilet paper into the personnel department, \"is basically focused on the military and doesn't care\". A department of defence insider involved in getting out the vote overseas puts it more harshly: \"The senior military leadership will only admit they have a responsibility to help civilians get involved in elections if you force it down their throat. They're only interested in the soldiers.\" </p> <p>The Pentagon denies these charges. As each misstep has occurred, deputy undersecretary of defence Charles Abell has defended the FVAP, saying it is making a heroic effort to reach all citizens overseas through voting workshops and toll-free telephone numbers. Indeed, all observers agree that the FVAP has gone to extraordinary lengths this year to get out the military vote. Still, Democrats suspect that in the case of the online ballot, it's no accident that the agency did not move faster: The measure mainly benefits civilians, many more of whom will support John Kerry than their counterparts in the military. </p> <p>Dzieduszycka-Suinat frets darkly that \"higher up, someone is saying: 'Make sure there are problems.'\" From the perspective of Wright, from the Military Voting Rights Project, political pressure is a given. \"When Clinton was in charge, they tried to suppress the military vote for that very reason,\" he says. \"I would not disagree,\" he says, that politics this year, too, plays a role. Faced with a voting programme that at best is ineffective, and at worst partisan, ordinary citizens have been forced to pick up the slack. Wright's organisation, for instance, blitzed the country's election offices with faxed alerts telling them how to process the write-in ballot. And it is thanks mainly to the efforts of two smart groups of expatriates that tens of thousands of new voters made it through the registration process at all. The FVAP distributed millions of registration postcards, but without help, the complex rules daunted many civilians. </p> <p>The state department, stretched thin by new visa regulations imposed after 9/11, has nowhere near the resources in its consulates to help citizens that the department of defence has deployed for its soldiers abroad, a high-ranking official said. Though it has done its best to walk civilians through the 369-page \"Black Book\" of state-by-state election rules, \"we literally don't have the staff to be able to do this,\" the official said. The upshot: There is a military voting assistance officer for every 30 to 50 soldiers, but the onus is on the civilian to fill out the form alone. </p> <p>Democrats Abroad thus began the campaign season camped at card tables on foreign street corners and screenings of English-language movies, walking voters one by one through the Byzantine process. In late May, Dzieduszycka-Suinat and Mitch Wolfson, head of AOK Germany, looked at each other and said, in the words of Wolfson: \"There has to be a better way.\" In July, they took the federal registration form, simplified it, and lobbed it into cyberspace. Beyond the 140,000 mostly Democrats who registered online, another 170,000 physically registered through Democrats Abroad, according to John McQueen, the group's international campaign chair. Thousands more signed up through another clever website, the Amsterdam-based Tell an American to Vote. </p> <p>What infuriates AOK more than anything else, though, is the vast disparity in money and energy between the military and civilian efforts. Overseas civilians, who turn out at half the rate of the military, arguably need more help, they say. While FVAP spent its $5.5m budget mainly to reach half a million soldiers - a ratio that works out to $11 per vote - the Democratic National Committee spent $50,000 on a website that worked out to less than 75 cents a vote. </p> <p>Republicans eschewed pavement-pounding and bought dozens of ads in the military Stars &amp; Stripes, International Herald Tribune and English-language papers in key countries like Mexico, Canada and Israel, which together host some 1.5 million eligible American voters, says Hills of Republicans Abroad. Registrations are up fourfold over 2000. The Bush campaign is focused on large communities of American retirees overseas and counting on its traditional bases among businesspeople abroad and the military, where, Hills says, \"we're very confident we're going to get a strong majority\". </p> <p>Which way these hordes of new voters go is, in fact, the big overseas question - assuming they get to vote. Democrats and Republicans alike see gold in both the civilian and military camps. What's undisputed is that the Bush administration has galvanised overseas voters as never before. \"The entire world is against Bush, and we reflect that view that America has lost all its credibility abroad,\" says McQueen of Democrats Abroad. \"I was tired of cringing in the supermarket whenever I spoke English to my kids, knowing how much we as Americans were hated,\" says Dzieduszycka-Suinat. Hills, for her part, reports that many Republicans, angered at what they see as unjust attacks, are coming out in equal droves to support the president. On both sides, stories abound of older Americans, and dual citizens who've kept their American passports, emerging like Rip Van Winkle to vote for the first time in 30 or 40 years. </p> <p>In reality, the political affiliation of these voters is unknown. Both sides claim a 60% edge: Democrats, based on a Zogby study, say that Americans with passports tend to vote liberal. Republicans, meanwhile, cite international business and the conservatism of Pentagon civilian employees and soldiers. Yet both estimates are what military people call SWAG - scientific wild-ass guesses - about a woolly and ever-growing overseas population of civil servants, diplomats, employees of global businesses, students, journalists, artists, academics and, yes, soldiers on the battlefield. </p> <p>Since January, when the Pentagon decreed \"100% contact,\" every officer and enlisted man or woman has had a registration application pressed into his or her hands. Soldiers have been exhorted to vote at daily formation and while watching ballgames on Armed Forces TV, and they are reminded that \"It's Your Future - Vote for It\" on the bottom on their paycheques. After the \"horror story\" of 2000, the military is \"extremely vigilant\" this time around, says Captain Christina Maxwell-Borges, a voting assistance officer at the US Army Installation Management Agency in Stuttgart. </p> <p>At US Army Europe headquarters in Heidelberg, voting activists and Americans who've worked for the Army for decades say ordinary soldiers are more motivated than they've ever seen. Even with the massive deployment of voting officers, a non-partisan citizens group like the NAACP, which conducted registration drives on base, was swamped. \"Often we couldn't keep up with the demand,\" says Billee Manigault, an NAACP volunteer. \"There's a definite interest in participating,\" echoes Charles Keene of Democrats Abroad and the NAACP. \"From almost everyone you heard, it was, 'You better believe I'm going to vote.'\" </p> <p>Despite several recent polls showing staunch support for President Bush among high-ranking officers, soldiers on base and Pentagon civilians active in Democratic politics say the mood in the military is far more mixed. The controversial mission in Iraq has brought a sea change in political attitudes on base, these observers report. McQueen, a retired military civil servant, says, \"You're not seeing the kind of pressure to vote Republican you always had in the past.\" </p> <p>The strong pro-Republican culture that emerged in the military in the wake of Vietnam has begun to splinter, many observers say. A report in the Washington Monthly last year described rank-and-file soldiers, who are disproportionately non-white, working-class and female, as increasingly diverging from an ideologically conservative officer corps. \"For a long time here, Democrats were in the closet,\" concurs Trenton Browne, a military security contractor who works on bases from Heidelberg to Kaiserslautern. \"Now in the lower ranks you hear people speaking openly about their dissent.\" </p> <p>Gauging the overseas vote thus becomes a numbers game. Military turnout at home and abroad is high. More than 60% of soldiers overseas voted in 2000, double the record of expatriates, who turned out at a rate of 37%, according to the FVAP (though in both groups, the number of uncounted votes dropped those figures by at least 15%). Many expect even higher overseas military turnout this year. How many of those 500,000 active duty service people will vote for Kerry, or Bush, is the question. </p> <p>A survey of 4,000 service people, released last week by the Military Times, revealed strong loyalty to the president: 72% of those on active duty would vote for him, and 17% would vote for Kerry. In the view of military analyst Peter Feaver of Duke University, the early traction Kerry had with the troops has been lost by his recent hammering of the war as a \"colossal mistake\". Being a decorated Vietnam veteran doesn't improve Kerry's stock with the \"career military\" people polled by the Military Times, either; in fact, two-thirds hold the senator's long-ago anti-war activism against him. </p> <p>The survey, however, concentrated on higher-ranking service people, and is not representative of the rank and file. Along Heidelberg's main street, off-duty soldiers, some fresh from combat in Iraq, divided evenly between rejecting Kerry because \"he doesn't support the troops\" and supporting him \"because a lot of us feel jerked around\". \"People think the military is totally Republican, and that's definitely not true,\" says one strolling soldier, a burly 30-year-old from Florida. \"There's a lot of different views within the ranks.\" Capt Maxwell-Borges, the Stuttgart voting officer, agrees. \"Surprisingly, it's been really mixed,\" she says. \"A lot of people support Kerry because he's a veteran and says he's going to increase military spending, and others are the more traditional pro-Republicans. But I've been on bases in the past three elections and I have to say that this time [political views] seem a lot more varied.\" </p> <p>No one expects the soldier vote to swing to Kerry, but a softening of Bush's overseas military support could be significant. \"Even 100% military turnout overseas only equals 160,000 additional votes,\" points out Brett Rierson, co-founder of the Democratic Hong Kong website. With activists guesstimating that the overseas civilian haul could be as high as 2 million, a strong showing for Kerry among enlisted troops could neutralise the Republican advantage. </p> <p>In any event, it's unlikely anyone will know until well after November 2. Several states, in a scramble to accommodate overseas voters' late ballots, have extended their deadlines. As it now stands, Florida, Washington, Iowa, Colorado and Illinois allow ballots to be received late, in some cases up to 10 days after election day. The justice department, at the prompting of the FVAP, has sued Pennsylvania to extend its deadline by two weeks as well. </p> <p>Nor will Americans find out how effectively the overseas vote has been handled until \"after the horses have left the barn,\" says Joe Smallhoover, legal counsel for Democrats Abroad. Voting reform passed by Congress in 2002 requires states to track overseas ballots, at long last. But more to the point, Smallhoover says: \"We have to do more than reform the FVAP; we have to reform the whole system.\" Wright, the military voting expert, agrees. He advocates placing the whole overseas voting operation in the hands of the new Election Assistance Commission, a far better-funded agency created by the 2002 Help America Vote act that is supposed to help states improve their equipment and procedures. </p> <p>All this, however, lies in the future. In the meantime, Democrats Abroad has formed a \"rapid response\" team to unsnarl problems voters abroad have encountered with their county election officials. Thousands of lawyers on both sides are renting office space in battleground states, ready to pounce on illegalities in stateside balloting and absentee votes. For now, overseas voters groping their empty mailboxes can only download the write-in ballot, send it in - in the faith that local election officials will accept it - and pray. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b>Alix Christie is a reporter and former editor of the foreign service of the San Francisco Chronicle</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b>This article has been provided by Salon through a special arrangement with Guardian Newspapers Limited</p> <p>\u00a9 Salon.com 2004</p>",
  "President Hamid Karzai has won the majority of votes in the Afghan election, securing over 55 % and paving for the way for him to become the country's first popularly elected president. <p>Results posted on the <a href=\"http://www.afg-electionresults.org/\">website</a> of the Joint Electoral Management Board (JESB) - an Afghan and United Nations election commission - showed Mr Karzai way ahead with 55.3 % of the vote while his nearest rival, former education minister Yonous Qanooni secured only 16.2 %</p> <p>With nearly 95 % of votes counted, the interim leader already has more than half the estimated 8.1m votes cast. Under election rules, a candidate must secure 50 % plus one vote to win.</p> <p>A spokesman for Mr Qanooni conceded defeat last night, according to Reuters, but official confirmation of Karzai's victory was frozen pending the outcome of an investigation into alleged polling irregularities. </p> <p>The official result will be announced by the JESB later this week, after it has seen a report into the allegations by an independent. The three-man panel, made up of a Canadian diplomat and election experts from Britain and Sweden, is due to meet most of the 18 candidates later today to discuss claims of fraud.</p> <p>The biggest problem was the use of imperfect indelible ink on voters hands, which potentially allowed for multiple voting.</p> <p>Among the other candidates, Hazara Shia leader Muhammad Mohaqeq received 11.8 % and Uzbek general Abdul Rashid Dostum had 10.3 %. The only female presidential candidate, Masooda Jalal, was running sixth, with 80,922 votes, or 1.1 %. </p> <p>Voting for the historic election began on October 9, with approximately 22,000 polling stations operational in all districts of Afghanistan's 34 provinces. Millions of mostly illiterate Afghans braved threats of violence and harsh weather to cast their first vote. </p> <p>A European envoy to Afghanistan said that while there has been some flaws, they were not serious enough to affect the actual outcome of the vote. \"The vote pretty accurately reflects what the people feel,\" Francesc Vendrell, the EU's special representative, told the BBC.</p> <p>The JESB has reported that 60 % of votes were cast by women and in some provinces there was a 100 % voter turnout. In the largest out-of-country voting operation ever, 2,800 polling stations served refugees in Iran and Pakistan. </p> <p>Mr Karzai has served as interim leader of Afghanistan since the US forces toppled the ruling Taliban regime. With a likely victory, he will be president for the next five years and his most immediate task will be to prepare for parliamentary elections.</p>",
  "Welcome to the Wrap, Guardian Unlimited's round-up of the best of the day's papers. <p><b>MASSACRE OF 50 IRAQI SOLDIERS</b></p> <p>Abu Musab al-Zarqawi's militant group - which now calls itself Al-Qaida in Iraq, or the al-Qaida Group of Jihad in the Land of Two Rivers - claimed responsibility last night for the slaughter of 49 Iraqi army recruits near Baquba.</p> <p>\"The Iraqi men had been on their way home on Saturday night to the cities of Amara and Kut from a training base run by the Americans outside Mandali in eastern Iraq, near the Iranian border, in five minibuses,\" reports the Independent. \"They had checked in their weapons at the base and were dressed in civilian clothes. They were stopped on a stretch of road between Baladruz and Badra in the Diyala province by insurgents dressed as security personnel at a fake checkpoint ... The recruits were taken in batches of 12 to the side of the road and made to remove their shoes and lie face down on the ground before being shot in the back of the head.\"</p> <p>The massacre \"makes a nonsense of claims that the situation on the ground is stabilising\", says the paper. But the Times applauds the \"simple courage\" of the GBP100-a-month recruits. \"Contrary to the impression that the terrorists and some western commentators would like the wider world to form of Iraq's new soldiers and police, they are not seen as collaborators. They have the overwhelming support of their compatriots.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, the Telegraph and Sun observe the Black Watch troops as they enter \"the most dangerous territory in Iraq\".

It was Wayne Rooney's 19th birthday, and he celebrated by winning what the Telegraph describes as a \"debatable penalty\" and \"striking and unanswerable second.\"</p> <p>Arsenal did not accept defeat gracefully. A \"tunnel dust-up\" involving the Arsenal manager and the referee led to players \"snarling and jabbing accusing fingers at each other\", according to the Sun.

  "President Ibrahim Rugova of Kosovo last night declared victory in the province's general election, which was marred by a Serb boycott. <p>Saturday's elections, overshadowed by the refusal of the vast majority of Serbs to vote in ethnic Albanian-dominated Kosovo, dealt a blow to international efforts to forge a multiethnic society there. </p> <p>Serb leaders in Kosovo and Serbia proper had called the boycott, saying the UN and Nato had failed to create an environment where Serbs could live safely. </p> <p>Preliminary results were not expected until today and final official results will be declared a week later. </p> <p>Mr Rugova claimed his Democratic League of Kosovo party had garnered more than 50% of the vote, retaining its position as the main party. </p> <p>Ibrahim Makolli from the Pristina-based Council for the Defence of Human Rights and Freedoms said the Democratic party of Kosovo came second with 27%, followed by the Alliance for the Future of Kosovo with 8%. Both are led by former ethnic Albanian rebel leaders. </p> <p>Kosovo's ethnic Albanians - who make up 90% of the 2 million population - viewed the elections as a means to further their goal of securing independence. Kosovo Serbs and Belgrade want the province to remain part of Serbia-Montenegro. </p> <p>A projection indicated that none of the ethnic Albanian parties could govern alone, echoing the previous election three years ago, which resulted in a political stalemate for three months. </p> <p>Officials did not specify how many Serbs cast ballots but said their turnout was very low. Overall turnout was estimated at 53%. </p> <p>There appeared to be disenchantment also in the ranks of ethnic Albanians unhappy with the progress made since the end of the 1998-99 Kosovo war, because officials have failed to address the dire economic situation. An estimated 60% unemployment rate has exacerbated political woes.</p> <p><b>Associated Press</b></p>",
  "<p><strong> To: all employees, newsroom:</strong> </p> <p>Here at the network we're working hard to insure that there is no repeat of Election Day 2000, when our predictive mechanisms let us down badly. Already this year we've had some problems, including when a Bush Wins banner was flashed during a Red Sox game. </p> <p><strong> New demographics.</strong> We've expanded our data to include ever more specific demographics. We will restrain our selves from making wider predictions, and confine ourselves to the voting intentions of small but significant blocs, such as Nevada Soccer Moms With Guns and Black Floridians Who Would Have Voted Kerry Had They Not Been Detained by the Police. They will help us to tell the real story of the election. </p> <p><strong> Voter Influence Assessment.</strong> We do not want to discourage people from voting, unless we are absolutely sure that they're wasting their time. Exit polling can make people think their vote doesn't count. On the other hand, we don't want to send viewers out for nothing; that's bad for business. </p> <p><strong> Calling the Election.</strong> This year we have several procedures installed: pushing the Bush Wins button will require a code word from two members of the election team, one of whom will be handcuffed to a politically neutral pundit. The Kerry Wins button, meanwhile, will be behind a glass panel which can only be broken by our magic Election Hammer. We're hoping this will stop producers from going with their instincts. </p> <p><strong> Mock Supreme Court.</strong> In case the election is close again, we've set up a nine-strong panel who will use computer simulations to choose the next president. During preliminary testing they gave it to Nader 16 times out 25, so the software needs a bit of tweaking. </p> <p><strong> Alternate Models.</strong> This year we'll show Americans how they might have voted had they been thinner, or how Bush's numbers might look if he had a beard. They have the right to know.</p>",
  "<p>There will have been much gnashing of teeth and furrowed brows among media folk recently when it was announced that John Brown, the erudite and gregarious owner of John Brown Publishing, had sold his company in a management buyout for a staggering - wait for it, sit down, steady yourselves - \u00a333m, personally walking away with \u00a320m. Having started the business 15 years ago, Brown has achieved what many dream of - getting out early with a bag full of cash. </p> <p>Having shed its consumer titles just a few years ago, JBP is solely a contract publisher, the market leader with a gargantuan 13% of the market. In the last financial year, it generated around \u00a351m. </p> <p>The buyout was backed by Bridgepoint, a private equity house. But what exactly were they buying? Admittedly JBP is thought to be the world's largest contract publisher, but in certain respects they are like an ad agency or a PR company - only as good as their last client, and their last client's last cheque. </p> <p>No one can deny, though, that there is a lot of business out there. Five of the UK's top 10 selling magazines are customer titles (Sky the magazine, Asda Magazine, O Magazine, Boots Health &amp; Beauty and the Somerfield Magazine), while the contract publishing market itself is worth in the region of \u00a3325m. </p> <p>However, the perception within the industry is that contract publishers have never been asked to make so many pitches, as clients become more demanding, and expect much higher production values. Principally they are looking for more bang for their buck. </p> <p>Juliet Warkentin, editorial director at Redwood Publishing, agrees that the contract sector is having to work harder. \"The industry has changed and our whole market is under pressure, so we have to continually evolve. If you don't evolve then you're not doing your job.\" </p> <p>Feedback suggests that more and more clients are looking for quality products, for magazines that look and feel as much like \"proper\" consumer magazines as possible, magazines that will reflect well on their brands, magazines that have equally upmarket advertising. This makes the closure last year of the National Magazine Company's contract division (after just three years) rather strange, and although its net turnover was above \u00a33m, it obviously wasn't enough to make it viable. </p> <p>Of course there are those who say that contract publishers are simply publishers who couldn't crack it in the consumer press, and that they would all love to work in the real world (producing real magazines for real people that actually pay for the damn things). </p> <p>Publishers who produce contract titles as well as consumer titles say that clients come to them because they actually have experience of selling magazines at newsstands (Cond\u00e9 Nast, which publishes GQ, produces magazines for HSBC, Harrods and the Savoy Group among others, and would say that the quality reflects the standards of other CN titles like Vogue, Vanity Fair and Glamour). Contract publishers counter that clients prefer them because \"customer\" magazines are their forte, and that as they spend all their time producing them, they ought to know what they're talking about. But then they would say that, wouldn't they? </p> <p>When you get down to the nitty gritty, there is a lot of choice out there, and there are many pros and cons for choosing contract-only publishers or those who spend their time producing magazines that people actually have to pay for (and therefore have a much better idea of what readers and customers actually want). The nub is the client, as usual; and the quality of the magazines these companies produce depends a lot on the aspirations of the client, and their willingness to entertain idiosyncratic magazine ideas. </p> <p>JBP has one such client in Virgin Atlantic. It was Virgin who commissioned them to produce Carlos, the highly-stylised A5 inflight magazine it gives away to customers. The winner of various design awards, Carlos contains fiction, illustration, esoteric diatribes and arcane lists, and is the sort of thing that would last five minutes on the newsstands. Which is obviously why Virgin like it. </p> <p>And John Brown? He's probably looking forward to a very, very good lunch.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>Dylan Jones is the editor of GQ, which is published by Cond\u00e9 Nast</p>"
