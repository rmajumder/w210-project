  "In these uncertain years at the beginning of the 21st century and Washington's \"war on terror\", there are qualities middle America demands of a first lady, and Laura Bush seldom disappoints. <p>Poise. Grace. Good manners. Good looks. Those are the admiring comments that follow the presidential spouse on the campaign trail. This week brings her to five battleground states in three days. With polls suggesting that John Kerry is slowly eating away at Mr Bush's lead, Republican party officials joke that she is their stealth weapon. </p> <p>For a political wife who approved her husband's run for the presidency on the condition that she never be required to give a speech, Mrs Bush has become a crucial campaign asset. </p> <p>She has raised $10m (\u00a35.5m) at political fundraisers, and a Gallup poll gave her a 74% approval rating - far ahead of the president. </p> <p>Mr Bush's stock campaign ad shows Laura by his side, nodding as he talks about the pain of the September 11 attacks. He frequently begins his speeches by saying that the strongest argument he can make for his re-election is that Laura would return to the White House. </p> <p>The signs distributed at Ms Bush's campaign events read: \"W stands for women.\" When she appears in a modest auditorium in this small town in northern Wisconsin, Mrs Bush does not stoop to the conventional posturing of political wives. </p> <p>There are no fake hugs or air kisses, no pointing into the crowd in phony delight at recognising a friend. She waves, but only a bit, and with her elbow pinned to her waist. Once she begins reading her speech, her hands remain fixed on the podium, and only occasionally does she look at the crowd. </p> <p>When she does, she encounters near-universal delight. This congregation, as is the rule for Mrs Bush's events, is a careful collection of local Republican grandees and their friends. </p> <p>\"Classy, she's got real class,\" says Marlene Peterson, from Marathon, Wisconsin. She presses through the crowd to shake hands with the first lady, and reports that Mrs Bush possesses an unusually firm grip. \"It was like a ray of sunshine.\" </p> <p>Americans are split on what kind of woman they are looking for in the White House. In these parts, the higher-income end of a town where mores are fairly conservative, the partnership of Bill and Hillary Clinton is a thing of horror. Teresa Heinz Kerry, the wife of the Democratic candidate, is also suspect as a bit of a wild woman. </p> <p>Laura Bush, they say, is eminently more suitable. </p> <p>\"I think she is the example of a real lady. The other lady running has a lot of disqualifications,\" says Sharon Kolbe. \"She just doesn't have the decorum that Laura Bush has.\" </p> <p>Life in the White House has not been kind to assertive women. Mrs Clinton got her comeuppance with her spectacular failure to reform healthcare policy. Mrs Bush has been far more circumspect in pursuing her policy interest - literacy - discreetly inviting her favourite writers to the White House. </p> <p>She is far too disciplined to do much more than hint at disagreement with her husband's policies - as she did in an interview in October's GQ, when she intimated she did not share his rigid stance on abortion. </p> <p>\"She doesn't put herself before her husband. She supports her husband fully,\" says Sue Becker, whose daughter, Ann Hunger, adds: \"That's the way it should be, because her husband is the president.\" </p> <p>There are a few brave souls who say they prefer a woman with definite opinions, but they admit to feeling a bit lonely in Wausau. </p> <p>\"I think the first lady should have a story behind herself; but I don't imagine the rest of the country does,\" says Rebecca Pilgrim-Tylinski, a lawyer. </p> <p>After growing up an only child in Midland, Texas, Laura Welch as a young woman was interested in culture and travel. She visited Europe after college and worked as a teacher and a librarian. </p> <p>She was 30 - and a Democrat - when she met and married Mr Bush. The couple were the only ones among their friends still single at the time. </p> <p>Marriage into America's pre-eminent dynasty had its trials. Until he became a Christian, Mr Bush was an alcoholic. In 1986 Mrs Bush is said to have offered him the choice: \"Jim Beam or me.\" Their twin daughters, Jenna and Barbara, 22, have a string of arrests for underage drinking. </p> <p>But none of those faults in the first family - not even Mrs Bush's surreptitious smoking habit - detract from her appeal on the campaign trail. </p> <p>During the past few weeks, opinion polls have detected a slide in Mr Kerry's popularity among women - generally one of the Democratic party's core areas of support. Al Gore took 54% of the women's vote in 2000 against 43% for Mr Bush. </p> <p>But the nervousness of so-called \"security moms\" - women who think that dangerous times demand a tough leader - and the personal appeal of the first lady are bringing female voters around to Mr Bush. </p> <p>So Mrs Bush is out on the road, delivering her 25-minute speech, working the lines, shaking hands and posing for photographs. </p> <p>Like many political speeches, hers rarely deviate from a standard text. </p> <p>She urges people not to be discouraged by the rising US death toll in Iraq. \"These acts are grim reminders of why our war to defeat terrorism and create free societies in the Middle East is so important,\" she says. Later, several members of the audience say this was their favourite line. </p> <p>This is Mrs Bush's most important task - to validate the choices of a man who often seems abrasive and uncaring. Once that is done, she returns her message to the personal, with her trademark line: \"George and I grew up in west Texas, where the sky seems endless and so do the possibilities.\" </p> <p><b>First wives' club</b></p> <p><b> Hillary Clinton</b> </p> <p>Highly political, Mrs Clinton was accused of being too involved in government, particularly over health reforms. Her support of her husband during the Monica Lewinsky scandal may have saved his presidency. She is now a New York senator </p> <p><b> Barbara Bush</b> </p> <p>The matriarch of the Bush clan, she was well-liked and fairly apolitical. She wrote Millie's Book in 1990, a view of White House life from the family dog's perspective </p> <p><b> Nancy Reagan</b> </p> <p>Came second last in a 1993 popularity poll judging 37 US first ladies. She was derided for soliciting $200,000 from donors for a new set of state china and for aligning her schedule to astrological forecasts.

  "I have been back in the States for just two weeks, but it is already evident that people here expect John Kerry to lose. My Democrat friends don't want to believe it, but they know it none the less. To be sure, the opinion polls are in flux. At the end of last week, Gallup had Bush leading by 13 percentage points; the Pew Research Center by only one point. But such results suggest uncertainty about the likely scale of Kerry's defeat, scarcely a burgeoning grass-roots conviction that the White House is his to win. Surveys of the swing states tell the same sad story. Bush is currently ahead in Missouri by seven points, in New Hampshire by nine points, and in Arizona by 11 points. Everyday now, pro-Democrat columnists in the New York Times bombard Kerry with advice, and assure each other, as if in comfort, that he is always at his best with his back to the wall. <p>Some of the reasons why his campaign has conspicuously not caught fire - despite the war going badly and the sluggishness of the US economy - are clear enough. The Democrats' electoral strategy has often seemed introspective and at times almost perversely maladroit. </p> <p>Thus the Republicans gambled profitably and staged their convention in liberal but post-9/11 New York. The Democrats played safe and went for Boston, and so played too into the hands of those wanting to represent them as quintessentially east coast and out of touch. The Republicans have nurtured their natural supporters while also reaching out. Hence Bush's advocacy of an amendment to the constitution forbidding same-sex marriage. This was never going to be passed, but it reassured the Christian Right that he was one of them. The Democrats, though, often seem strangely negligent of their core voters. Kerry has been almost silent during the campaign on abortion rights, for instance, and it is Bush, not he, who is currently enjoying a surge in female support. </p> <p>But the problem, crucially, is Kerry himself. He is intelligent, experienced, thoughtful, brave and very rich - but (thus far) an unconvincing candidate. When caught off guard on camera, Bush's eyes can look vacant or perplexed, but his body is usually at ease. In the same position, Kerry often appears contorted and worried, as well he might. And because he lacks physical ease and charisma, and his voice does not soar, even his most searching speeches have only a limited impact. As the historian Richard Hofstadter observed, there is a long, disreputable tradition of anti-intellectualism in American politics, and Bush's studiously plain, sometimes stumbling language resonates with this very successfully. Kerry's speaking style, by contrast, is clever enough to alienate, without being so powerful as to compel attention anyway. </p> <p>This matters because historically it has always been difficult for challengers to defeat US presidents who have completed a full term and who are seeking another. On the very few occasions that the challenger has won, the incumbent has usually been visibly a failure in some way while the challenger has been manifestly first class and formidable. Thus Woodrow Wilson was able to make short work of the hapless Taft in 1912; Franklin D Roosevelt demolished Hoover in 1932, before going on to win the presidency a record three times more; and a youthful Bill Clinton trounced George Bush Sr in 1992 by making him look stiff and old by comparison. In 2004, however, the incumbent president is not yet so damaged, nor is his opponent yet so remarkable as to make a political upset of this sort appear very likely. </p> <p>But it could happen if Kerry and the Democrats came up with an alternative political narrative. In the US - and elsewhere - successful parties need a storyline that voters can relate to, an intelligible plot of some sort, especially now that so many older, formal ideologies have lost force. For proof of this, one has only to look at Margaret Thatcher's career and ideas. She won successive elections in large part because she and her advisers contrived, quite consciously, a more effective British story than her opponents. True, it was a highly selective and deeply divisive story. But it cohered, and for a decade or more it worked. </p> <p>In speeches over the years and ultimately in her autobiography, she argued that Britain had won the second world war but had lost the peace; that Labour and old-style Conservatives had been complicit in this post-1945 failure which reached its nadir in the 1960s; and that sexual promiscuity, improvidence, declining respect for institutions, runaway inflation and state expenditure and over-mighty trade unions were all symptoms of the rot. But she would transform things. It would be tough. There would be sacrifices. But Britain would shine again. </p> <p>If some of this bald summary still sounds familiar today, this is not surprising. There is a degree to which New Labour has deliberately spatchcocked its own reform agenda with sections of this Thatcherite national narrative. Not for nothing do David Blunkett and Tony Blair go on in their turn about the laxity of the 60s. They are stealing chapters from a story that has proved its political worth. </p> <p>Conversely, the current Conservative party in Britain, like the Democrats in the US, suffers at present from its failure to invent a distinctive and cogent new political narrative. Neither party yet has a story of its own that sticks together. President Bush, however, does have a story, though a rudimentary one. It goes like this: America is the greatest, most exceptional nation in history; beacon and leader of the free world. But it is threatened from without by terrorists, insurgents, the French and cheap exports, while higher taxes and too much questioning of traditional values would corrode it from within. But he will keep Americans safe and strong. And he will keep them free. This is the storyline Democrats need to challenge and replace, while being careful to preserve their patriotic credentials. </p> <p>The task is hard but not impossible. To a degree that Europeans do not always understand, very many Americans, and not just Democrats, are troubled at present. For all their fierce nationalism, many dislike appearing as an invading empire. For all their traditional isolationism, many are appalled by the level of anti-Americanism that now exists around the world. For all their natural, post 9/11 fears, many believe that the Patriot Act has eroded too many American liberties, and provoked too much pessimism and paranoia. Millions in the States dislike Bush intensely, and many millions more would be open to persuasion by a plausible challenger. But the Democrats need to be seen to be offering a different, more generous, more hopeful and more open political narrative. The materials are there. It is just time that's short.</p>",
  "In the run-up to the presidential debates - the first is on Thursday - no detail has been left to chance, not even today's ritual coin-toss to decide whether John Kerry or George Bush will get first and last word. <p>Decisions on lighting, camera angles, makeup and air conditioning were negotiated by Democratic and Republican lawyers. </p> <p>A 32-page \"memorandum of understanding\" between the parties states, as rule number one, that in the first debate in Florida the lecterns are to be 1,27 metres (4ft 2in) high, and will be 3 metres (10ft) apart. </p> <p>At 1,93 metres (6ft 4in), Mr Kerry is 12cm taller than Mr Bush - an advantage the Republicans have sought to tackle by building the lecterns to an unthreatening height, and keeping them far apart. Candidates are barred from wandering around the set when they speak, to prevent Mr Kerry looming over Mr Bush. </p> <p>A Democrat clause prohibits candidates from using \"risers or any other device to create an impression of elevated height\". </p> <p>Mr Kerry has a reputation for longwindedness, so the Republicans insisted on flashing lights to signal to viewers when a speaker exceeds his allotted time. </p> <p>The candidates will have dressing rooms of equal size, a pen and paper will be the only props and cameras will be fixed on the speakers to prevent shots of yawning or mocking spectators.</p>",
  "Nobody said the hunt for Osama bin Laden would be easy. It's Sunday evening at Bagram air base, the US military hub in Afghanistan, and Specialist Henry Carter has booked himself a little treat. <p>\"It's a manicure,\" he explains, as a beautician dips his outstretched fingers into a bowl of warm water at the base day spa. </p> <p>\"Helps me relax,\" he adds, a little bashfully. </p> <p>In the next chair, a soldier is having his eyebrows trimmed; behind the curtain another is mid-pedicure. </p> <p>At reception, Sergeant Gregory Duda flicks through a copy of the National Enquirer - M-16 rifle by his side - waiting for his weekly massage. All 12 booths are occupied. </p> <p>There is no contradiction between body care and military machismo, says the intelligence officer from Georgia. \"It keeps you ready,\" he says. \"Sore muscles can really inhibit if you have to fight.\" </p> <p>The US president, George Bush, has vowed to keep his army in Afghanistan for the long haul. He has just deployed another 1,000 soldiers to support the country's October 9 election. And as long as Operation Enduring Freedom lasts, his generals want to keep their troops happy, healthy and, if necessary, moisturised. </p> <p>Bagram is a fortress-like base, surrounded by walls, sandbags and razor wire. Outside the gates children beg passing troops for pens. But inside is a cornucopia of modern conveniences: a music, food and electronics store; internet and video halls; esoteric gift outlets; a beauty spa; and, since July, Afghanistan's first Burger King. </p> <p>\"We know we're going to be here for a while,\" says Major Stacy Bathrick, a public affairs officer. \"If the soldiers have a good quality of life [on base], it means their morale is high when out on mission.\" </p> <p>The base store - commonly known as the Postal Exchange - sells everything from pistol holders to DVDs, microwave meals and Osama bin Laden T-shirts. Soldiers are well fed, said Kenneth Limtiaco of AAFES, the company that runs the shops. \"But if you want a mocha frappuccino, you can't get it in the mess hall.\" </p> <p>Neither can you get a bust of Lenin or a souvenir medal to mark the \"Order of the Red Flag Socialist competition\" - some of the items on sale at the Soviet-themed gift shop. </p> <p>It's cheap - 20% less than in the US, says Mr Limtiaco. The beauty salon, which offers a full-body massage for $15 (\u00a38.30), recently extended to a 15-hour day to meet demand. </p> <p>There are plans for expansion. Pizza Hut and Subway outlets are on the way, and another Burger King is destined for the southern base in Kandahar. AAFES reinvests the profits into other facilities, including a gymnasium complete with a mountain-climbing wall, internet cafes, phone centres and distance learning classes. For the less active there are PlayStation consoles, free popcorn and satellite TV. </p> <p>There is also a strong social element. In Kandahar the 24-hour Green Beans coffee shop has become the base's social focus. Thursday is salsa night, when soldiers gather to tango into the night. \"It's really fun,\" says Specialist Cassie Gonzalez, a Texan architecture student who suspended her studies for military service. </p> <p>Camp life is far less luxurious at the remote \"firebases\", where front-line troops are working on reconstruction and hunting the Taliban remnants. There is little power or running water and the threat of death lurks: three American soldiers were killed last week. </p> <p>But there is room for occasional extravagances. At Camp Anaconda in arid Uruzgan province, troops celebrated a resupply run last week with a lobster-and-steak dinner. </p> <p>Fun at the major bases is subject to two restrictions: no alcohol, and no sex between soldiers. The top brass take an indulgent approach to the second rule, says one woman soldier: \"If anyone thinks there's no sex, they're just kidding themselves,\" she says. </p> <p>There is no such ambiguity at the Bagram beauty salon, staffed by hairdressers and beauticians from the central Asian republic of Kyrgyzstan. </p> <p>A notice tells customers to wear underpants, and warns: \"Soliciting any sexual or indecent services/acts is subject to punishment under the Military Code of Uniform Justice.\" </p> <p>Tania Mitko, the 24-year-old manager, says: \"We're just here to work normally - that's all. Sometimes the soldiers ask us out for a coffee and a talk. But we always say no.\"</p>",
  "Does anyone still seriously believe there will still be an American army of occupation in Iraq in two years' time? A great many people, most of them Iraqis, will be killed before the Americans can leave, but the signs are clear enough that they can't stay. In Vietnam, the Americans were famously advised to declare victory and get the hell out. In Iraq, the only strategy left is to declare democracy and get the hell out. <p>Even this will be difficult, but the alternatives are simply impossible. Meanwhile, other bad things will happen that are the ineluctible consequences of this administration's misdeeds. The tax cuts will have to be paid for; the dollar will have to come down; al-Qaida or some similar network will do something atrocious either in the USA or in Britain.</p> <p>So why should anyone vote for John Kerry? Here is Mr Bush, like a conman on a spree in a luxurious restaurant, caught at the moment when the manager approaches to say that there seems to be a problem with his credit card. Someone, soon, is going to be washing the dishes for a week to pay the bill. Justice demands it should be Mr Bush; but if Mr Kerry wins, he'll be the skivvy in the kitchen and he will be blamed for everything.</p> <p>I've made the argument myself, though I know it is merely a filigree on despair. If, as seems perfectly possible, Mr Bush wins the election this year then we will all be looking for some consolation, and that's the only scrap that I can find. </p> <p>It isn't negligible. A weak Kerry presidency followed be a Republican resurgence would be a disaster, and it will be a very remarkable president who can get through the next four years without looking weak. Maybe it would be better to grit our teeth and wait for the time of proper and unmistakable nemesis.</p> <p>But there are two arguments against this. The first one stems from competence. Disaster isn't a binary state. No matter how bad things get, George Bush can make them worse. There are some men who are useless leaders in peacetime but splendid in times of war. In four years, Bush has proven himself exceptional: he has been given the chance to fail in times of both peace and prosperity, and at a time of war and danger. He has made the most of both. Who knows how he might not exploit the opportunities of a second term?</p> <p>John Edwards said last week: \"If American voters want four more years of job losses and chaos and killing in Iraq, then George W. Bush is their guy. If not, they will vote for John Kerry.\" I suspect they will get four more years like this whoever they vote for. But at least they will have leadership capable of minimising the damage.</p> <p>The second argument is moral. For Bush to win requires that people vote for him, and I honestly don't see how anyone with a scrap of moral feeling and patriotism could vote for the government responsible for Abu Ghraib. There's no doubt that the Bush government is entirely responsible for the torture there, and elsewhere. The original decision that the Geneva convention's prohibition of torture was \"quaint\" came from a White House lawyer, Alberto Gonzalez. The general whose visit from Guantanamo Bay to Abu Ghraib seems to have led to the institutionalisation of torture there has now been appointed the governor of the prison.</p> <p>The details of what is done there can be read by anyone who wants to know in official American government reports. A very small fraction of General Fay's report describes how one detainee was \"left naked in his cell for extended periods, cuffed in his cell in stressful positions (\"High cuffed\"), left with a bag over his head for extended periods, and denied bedding or blankets\" and made to \"bark like a dog, being forced to crawl on his stomach while MPs spit and urinated on him, and being struck causing unconsciousness.\"</p> <p>Even on a completely amoral and pragmatic judgment, this was force misapplied. The tortures described were perpetrated last autumn. Can anyone claim that the Americans have better intelligence or more control over the insurgency today than they did a year ago?</p> <p>But on a moral level, which is where both candidates are appealing to their voters, this is quite simply indefensible. Only one thing could make it worse, and that Mr Bush has duly done. He has claimed that it was legal, because he ordered that it should be.</p> <p>No, this is no time for pity and frivolity. Democracy has to mean millions of people saying, in November, \"Christ, you can't do that\", and making him hear.</p> <p>* Andrew Brown is the author of The Darwin Wars: The Scientific War for the Soul of Man and In the Beginning Was the Worm: Finding the Secrets of Life in a Tiny Hermaphrodite.

  "<p>Maybe it is because the splits between the state department and Pentagon are as well attested as those between Gordon Brown and Tony Blair, or that the remarks attributed to him (calling the Washington neocons <a href=\"http://observer.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,1302806,00.html\">\"fucking crazies\"</a>) appear to point in one direction; but with every Colin Powell statement it is hard not to recall Austrian statesman Metternich's words on hearing of the death of a rival: \"I wonder what he meant by that.\"</p> <p>The latest \u2013 telling <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Sections/ThisWeek/\">George Stephanopoulos's ABC show</a> yesterday that Iraq was \"getting worse\" \u2013 seemed to suggest he was either undermining the Bush administration's usual optimism or had been put out to deflect John Kerry's attack. It is hard to tell. His determination to hold a January election in the face of \"an intense insurgency\" has challenged Donald Rumsfeld's analysis that the vote <a href=\"http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/11F55C5F-CD65-4445-A0C9-C0A1F62F1740.htm\">would only be held where it was safe enough</a> (\"Life's not perfect,\" he said. \"Is it better than not having an election?\") but still puts him at the grimmer end of President Bush's relentless march of freedom.</p> <p>Mr Powell is a military man so it is tempting to see a strategic vision at work, a credible government being the best beginning to an exit strategy (\"We will have to increase our efforts [\u2026] not walk away and pray and hope for something else to happen,\" he said), but at least someone in the administration is acknowledging the increasing violence in Iraq. The same day the <strong>Washington Post</strong> published a report that put <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A50259-2004Sep25.html\">insurgent attacks at 70 a day</a>, up from the 40 or 50 before the June handover, and spreading into previously peaceful parts of the country.</p>",

  "<p>Apparently Dan Rather didn't get my email. \"Dear Dan,\" I wrote back in January, \"as you probably know, it's an election year. And in election years people sometimes do bad things. Bad things like forging memos that appear to show that George W Bush received special treatment during his time in the National Guard in the 1970s. Bad things like sending those memos to CBS in the hope that they'll report them without taking any real steps to verify their accuracy. But don't worry,\" I continued, helpfully, \"all you have to do if you receive such a memo is to run it through Google to see if, say, your source is a notorious Bush-hating fantasist who claims that the president has sent 'goons' to intimidate him. Shouldn't take you more than a couple of minutes and it'll save you looking like a bit of a prat.\" </p> <p>Maybe Dan was out of the office when the email arrived and his secretary forgot to pass it on. Or maybe his Hotmail was over quota. Whatever the reason, the CBS news anchor clearly didn't get the message. Because had he done so, he wouldn't have mashed his reputation to a pulp two weeks ago by reporting just such a bogus anti-Bush document. The prat. </p> <p>Of course this isn't the first time the media have been fooled by a bad hoax but what makes this scam so interesting is that it was exposed, not by a jealous rival news organisation, but by a humble blogger. Or, to be exact, a humble blogger and a couple of hundred self-appointed experts. </p> <p>A few hours after Rather's 60 Minutes report was broadcast, an angry fellow called Buckhead posted a message on the rightwing discussion site <a href=\"http://www.Freerepublic.com\">Freerepublic.com</a>. Buckhead had noticed something about the Bush memo that apparently no one at CBS had spotted: that the fonts used weren't available on typewriters owned by the military in the 1970s. Uh-oh. The claim was seized upon by a blog called <a href=\"http://www.Powerlineblog.com\">Powerlineblog.com</a>, which became a clearing house for theories about the memo. Before long, messages were pouring in from hundreds of self-appointed typewriter experts and ex-military types pointing to other aspects of the document that could only have been produced with modern word processors. For the right-leaning bloggers, this was dynamite. They might as well have discovered that the Turin Shroud was created in Photoshop and laser-printed on to Lycra. </p> <p>And yet CBS held their ground, with news president Andrew Heyward saying that he saw \"no percentage of possibility\" that the documents were fake. The forgery claims spread from blog to blog until, eventually, the protests became so loud that they woke up the mainstream media. Finally stories about the hoax hit the front pages, and Rather had to admit that he'd been duped. Victory for the people of Blogistan over the arrogance of traditional media. Hurrah! </p> <p>But while it's fun to crow about Blogistan's role in \"Rathergate\", there are important lessons to be learnt by both sides about the relationship between bloggers and the mainstream media. For the bloggers, the lesson is simple - no matter what Matt Drudge might tell you, a hot story in Blogistan is still worth nothing until the mainstream media pick it up. </p> <p>But for the mainstream media, the lesson is more harsh. Your obsession with scoring points over your rivals means that your fact-checking methods will never, ever, beat those of Blogistan. When 60 Minutes (or the Sunday Times or the Mirror) is handed a bombshell political document it will consult experts in an attempt to determine its authenticity. But it won't make the document available on the internet, inviting thousands of self-appointed experts to pick holes in it prior to broadcast. That would be insane. </p> <p>Or would it? Perhaps Rathergate is a sign that it's time for the mainstream media to change their methods. Perhaps every news organisation should create a blog for fact checking. Perhaps the next time a potentially election-altering document lands on a journalist's desk, they should immediately publish it online, and let the good people of Blogistan weave their peer-reviewing magic before any allegations are broadcast. And, who knows, perhaps the publicity generated by this review process would actually increase viewing figures when the (now meticulously fact-checked) story eventually reaches the screen. Of course, this will spoil the journalist's exclusive but surely journalism isn't just about ratings and profits? Surely it's more important to get the story out, and to get it right than it is to trounce your rivals with blockbuster scoops that later turn out to be embarrassing hoaxes, isn't it Dan? Dan? Are you listening Dan? Hmmm. Perhaps I should send him another email.</p>",
  "<p>As birds fly south and beaches empty, the aid community is gathering for a new school year at the joint annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. </p> <p>There are some big exams in the coming year, with the UK leading the way: in chronological order, the report of the Africa Commission, the G8 summit in Scotland, our EU presidency, and the UN summit in September next year on progress towards the millennium development goals. Aid will feature prominently in all of these. There is more money available, but there are also five tests hidden in the timetable. Will governments pass? </p> <p>First, governments need to decide on a new president for the World Bank, to replace James Wolfensohn whose term expires in 2005. Historically, the job remains in the patronage of the US president, to balance a European appointment to the IMF. This is obviously wrong, and there have been calls for a transparent selection process, based on merit and open to all nationalities. The European donors are unlikely to stand up for a better process, having just secured the IMF post for their own candidate, the former Spanish economy minister Rodrigo Rato. But they should - and should insist on a candidate, whoever wins the US election, committed to the pro-poor and internationalist position that Wolfensohn has largely followed. Developing countries should also be staking positions here. Should Wolfensohn be asked to stay on while a new appointment process is put in place? </p> <p>Second, the replenishment of the International Development Association needs to be decided by December and ratified by June next year. The IDA is the soft-loan window of the World Bank, committing some $8bn (\u00a34.5bn) a year towards poverty reduction programmes in about 70 countries that have little or no access to financial markets. In many, the IDA is the largest source of external funds. In most, it has huge influence. </p> <p>The US has been pushing the IDA to provide most if not all of its assistance as grants, not loans. This is consistent with the campaign for greater debt relief to poor countries, for most of whom the IDA is now the largest remaining creditor. A more selective proposal would be to give grants only to those countries that have no reasonable prospects of repaying - around a quarter of the total. Either way, governments should support a strong IDA for the poorest countries. If they decide to be magnanimous, by increasing the share of grants, they should provide additional funding so the burden does not fall on future borrowers. </p> <p>Third, however, the governance of the IDA, and for that matter the Bank as whole and the IMF, needs review. At present, the big donors dominate IDA policymaking and poor countries play only a supporting role. This needs to change. A progressive UK government would be pressing for greater direct accountability to poor countries, even though this will dilute its own influence. It would offer significantly increased funding in return for improved governance. It could start by measures to increase the lamentably low influence of Africa, as that is the main theme of the G8 next year. </p> <p>Fourth, we are going to hear a great deal in coming months about Gordon Brown's brain-child, the international financial facility. This is a device to speed up aid flows by raising money on bond markets, using promises of future aid as collateral. If the IFF does achieve enough momentum for lift-off in the next year, the critical question will be how to manage the money. Will this simply be a way of channelling more cash to an unreformed set of multilateral agencies? Or, equally unsatisfactory, will it be earmarked by individual donors as an extension of their bilateral aid? The best option would be for governments and agencies to bid for money on the basis of poverty impact, introducing genuine competition into the aid system. The chancellor is committed to results-based management: this is his chance to transform the essentially patronage-based allocation systems. </p> <p>Finally, competition in the aid system would help resolve the incoherent and inefficient structure of the aid industry. There are more than 90 international public aid agencies, ranging from very large to very small, with a high degree of overlap. Imagine being, say, Mozambique and facing 15 official delegations just on education development, or more visiting aid missions overall than there are days in the year. </p> <p>This market structure resembles nothing as much as one Wal-Mart and a whole string of corner shops. It would be both unstable and monopolistic in a genuine market, socially inefficient and politically unacceptable. But this is not a market, and it is not well regulated. No major aid agency has closed for decades while many have opened. The irony is that, unlike shops, the same owners - rich country governments - control all the outlets. They could decide for things to be otherwise, if they had the will. </p> <p>After years of decline, aid is at last increasing. More aid will help towards the millennium development goals, but it is not enough. The next big challenge, and the biggest task facing governments next year, is to take on reform, creating an aid system that is streamlined, effective and accountable. UN reform is at the heart of this, which is why next September's summit is important. </p> <p>Will governments around the world pass their exams? The beginning of the school year is an optimistic moment. Let's hope they do. </p> <p><em> Andrew Rogerson is a research fellow of the Overseas Development Institute; Simon Maxwell is its director </em></p>",

  "When journalist William Weston was invited to visit the secessionary US west coast states of Washington, Oregon and northern California in 1999, he came upon a society unlike any other. <p>In Ecotopia, all products from houses to shoes were made from sustainable, recyclable materials. Bikes could be found unlocked at every street corner, free to be used and left again by passers-by. Cars had been banned from San Francisco, and pollution was a crime. Locals enjoyed free love, honoured trees and lived in small, sustainable communities. In short, the hippies had taken over.</p> <p>Depending on your point of view, Ernest Callenbach's utopian 1975 novel Ecotopia: The notebooks and reports of William Weston is either an idealistic road-map to a sustainable society or a slightly sinister piece of lotus-eating fantasy.</p> <p>Whatever your opinion, its dream of an environmentalist political takeover has stubbornly failed to materialise in reality. Over the course of the 1990s, Green parties and factions made it into governing coalitions in 14 European countries, but the whiff of power is more often than not the kiss of death for their ambitions. Only in Germany have they survived without either electoral demolition or oligarchic corruption. In New Zealand, the Greens \"tolerate\" the Labour-led coalition government, but are well down in the polls since their high point at the 2002 election.</p> <p>Such concerns must be keeping Australian Greens up at night, given that they are expected to transform themselves from a fringe party to a significant power-broker at the federal election on October 9. How does a party founded on principles of pure idealism cope when thrown deep into the messy pit of politics?</p> <p>Observant readers may at this point be wondering if claims of a Green takeover are a little overheated. According to a Roy Morgan poll published today, the Greens are only expected to take nine per cent of the vote. This will take their representation to between four and seven seats, out of a total 76 in the senate.</p> <p>Not much, you might say. But minority parties in the senate hold a unique position in Australian politics. The Democrats party, an organisation absent in the house of representatives, currently holds seven seats in the senate, four of them up for grabs when half of senate seats go up for re-election in a fortnight.</p> <p>Numerically they don't amount to much, but strategically they are crucial because the government rarely gets a majority in the senate. So if the opposition refuses to support a bill or amends it to shreds, the Democrats - and the clutch of four independents in the senate - are in an influential position to negotiate their own amendments, in exchange for offering their votes to help the bill over the line.</p> <p>Since the 2001 election, they have exercised this power to block 10 government bills and allowed 400 others through. In the fields of unfair dismissal law, media ownership, and further privatisation of state telecommunication company Telstra, they have all used their influence to moderate government.</p> <p>Voters seem to like having a minority party in the senate because it prevents the house becoming either a partisan battlefield or a cosy duopoly between government and opposition. The Democrats' role, as founder Don Chipp proclaimed after breaking away from a 1977 coalition government, has always been \"to keep the bastards honest\". Their main campaign theme for this election has the leadership standing tough like the cast of a cop show above the tagline \"the lie detectors\".</p> <p>But Australia now seems to have decided to trade in its lie detectors for new models. The Democrats are facing annihilation at the next election, with a Morgan poll today showing their support at just 1%, down from 5.41% at the last election and 8.45% in 1998 when their current crop of candidates were elected. </p> <p>Waiting in the wings are the Greens, and their greatest asset is their leader, Bob Brown. At 59, he's the closest thing international environmental politics has to an elder statesman.</p> <p>He was working as a GP in the northern Tasmanian town of Launceston in 1972 when he joined the United Tasmania group, a party regarded as the forerunner of Green parties around the world.</p> <p>A campaign against dam-building on Tasmania's Franklin river in early 1980s propelled him to national prominence and the state parliament, and since 1996 he has been a senator for Tasmania.</p> <p>Voters across the political spectrum like him for the same reason that many of his parliamentary colleagues loathe him: his image of heart-on-sleeve integrity and his insistence on speaking out regardless of protocol.</p> <p>This image got its most significant airing last October during George Bush's high-security flying visit to Canberra. Still obsessed with their feelings of isolation from the wider world, Australian politicians normally treat such foreign dignitaries the way teachers treat school inspectors. Everyone in parliament is expected to be on their best behaviour. In the capital of a country famed for its devil-may-care attitude, \"protocol\" suddenly becomes the buzzword.</p> <p>So the heckling by Brown and fellow Greens senator Kerry Nettle during Bush's speech to parliament went down like a fart at a funeral. The pair were jostled by fellow politicians and received a 24-hour ban from parliament.</p> <p>But when Brown left Canberra and headed back to Tasmania for the weekend, the reception could not have been more different. He was treated to applause in an airport lounge, a standing ovation in a Hobart cafe, and a chorus of approval in the streets.</p> <p>It would be a mistake to think this was simply the result of him running into a lot of leftwingers. Brown's forthright behaviour had tapped into traditional Aussie values of integrity, irreverence and humour that cut across all political divides. </p> <p>It is this feeling of honesty about the Greens which is now propelling them ahead of the Democrats. The lie detectors lost the faith of voters when they used their bloc vote to pass the GST, a hugely unpopular VAT-style sales tax that Australia introduced in 2000. That action sparked a round of feuding, splits and leadership challenges which has seen Democrat support plummet to its current level, where they will be lucky to hold onto one seat come the election.</p> <p>The risk for the Greens is that holding the balance of power in the Senate could land them with many of the same problems that have hampered the Democrats.</p> <p>Assuming the narrow coalition victory that polls are predicting, the government could find itself thwarted at every turn by an implacably opposed group of Labor and Green senators. In such circumstances, Australian governments dissolve both houses of parliament and call another election, complaining about the minority senators who are stopping them running the country. The electorate usually punishes the opposition parties at the ballot.</p> <p>Such a situation could mean the Greens fading from influence almost as soon as they gain it, but the most obvious alternative would be equally unpalatable: for them to give their senate votes to a coalition government which stands for everything they are opposed to.</p> <p>There are other alternatives. A Labor victory would see the Greens becoming crucial partners in government, and a hung parliament could even result in them entering a coalition with Labor. A strong coalition performance in the senate would see them sidelined by a government majority that would turn the second house into a rubber stamp, much like Westminster's House of Lords.</p> <p>Whatever happens, in the long term the struggle for the election will be the least of the Greens' worries.</p>",
  "<p>A record to be proud of. Unemployment down by more than a million, growth averaging a shade under 3%, inflation below 2%, borrowing costs at their lowest for a generation. Labour today? No, that was John Major's economic record when his government went into meltdown at the 1997 election. </p> <p>Today Gordon Brown will stand up and say much the same as Kenneth Clarke said in the autumn of 1996: the economy is in fine fettle so why risk it by voting for the other lot? The background to Tony Blair's first landslide, however, shows there is reason to treat with caution the assumption that governments with a good story to tell on the economy inevitably win. They don't. </p> <p>Indeed, the worrying thing for Labour is that on current performance it is on course to secure a smaller percentage of the vote than Jim Callaghan did in the aftermath of the Winter of Discontent. So, does the economy no longer matter? The answer is that it does, but not in the simplistic way that has always been assumed. </p> <p>The good news for the government is that, unlike in 1970 and 1979, there is no compelling economic reason to kick Labour out of power. Political scientists have endlessly debated why the Conservative party enjoyed hegemony for most of the 20th century even though the class make-up of the electorate would have suggested governments of the left should have had primacy. One reason, perhaps, is that every time a government of the left did get into power it was blown away by a financial crisis, not always of its own making. The electorate thought Labour's heart was in the right place but doubted its competence to manage the economy as well as the Conservatives. </p> <p>Over the past seven years there has been nothing remotely to compare with the gold standard crisis of 1931 or the arrival of the International Monetary Fund in 1976, and thus no reason for voters to veer back towards a Conservative party which itself was in power for Black Wednesday, the most recent - and in many ways least excusable - of the UK's five emblematic financial disasters of the 20th century. </p> <p>Brown's greatest political achievement since 1997 has been to ensure that nothing has gone wrong. The big economic numbers - growth, unemployment and inflation - have been well behaved even if some of the component parts of the economy still give cause for concern. </p> <p>Labour's macro-economic framework, a refinement of that bequeathed by the Tories, has worked. The Bank of England's management of interest rates has been exemplary, with not a single month in which inflation has deviated more than one percentage point from its target. Brown's economic management means Tony Blair has been the one Labour prime minister not to preside over an economic crisis involving a run on the pound, devaluation or an unwanted visit from the International Monetary Fund. </p> <p>The political consequences of this economic and financial stability should not be underestimated. At this stage in the 1964-70 and 1974-79 governments, public spending was being cut following financial crises in mid-term, rather than being increased. If Labour's poll ratings look feeble at the moment, it can only be imagined the depths to which they would have sunk if Brown was now announcing a package of public spending cuts. </p> <p>The intriguing question, though, is why Labour's poll ratings should be as low as they are. Here's the bad news - really bad news - for the government. A poll conducted by YouGov for the Economist last week showed that 60% of voters thought they had not prospered under Labour and about the same proportion that the increases in public spending had made no difference to their lives. That's despite the fact that two-thirds of voters, and an even higher proportion of the middle classes, thought they were paying higher taxes. These are worrying findings. </p> <p>One explanation is that, despite the economic statistics, voters really are no better off after seven years of Labour. Another is that the public takes a well-functioning economy for granted after 12 years in which inflation and unemployment have fallen, growth has been robust and interest rates remained low. Governments, in other words, receive little or no credit for getting things right on the economy, but are still liable to carry the can if things go wrong. </p> <p>A third explanation is that Iraq has been so omnipresent in the past two years that it has drowned out every other aspect of government policy. This possibility was foreseen by some senior Labour figures, including Brown, during the build-up to war, and the political cost to the government has been enormous, especially among women voters. </p> <p>A survey for the Fawcett Society released yesterday found that 60% of women are unhappy with the job that Blair is doing and 63% of women are dissatisfied with the government's performance overall. Despite the extra billions pumped into healthcare, 38% of women think the NHS will deteriorate over the next few years while confidence in the prime minister is now as low as that experienced by Margaret Thatcher in the last 18 months of her premiership. </p> <p>Brown and his team view the draining away of trust with alarm. The fact that today's speech will focus on the need for unity suggests that the chancellor is not one of those who sees a third Labour victory as in the bag. What he will also be stressing is the need for the government to map out a progressive agenda for its third term, showing how economic stability can be the platform for full employment, even in the hard-core areas of joblessness, for low-cost housing and to better the lives of children. </p> <p>The hidden subtext of this is that Labour needs to reconnect with the voters, starting with its own natural supporters. Brown's argument is that, despite its two landslides, a demoralised opposition and a strong economy, Labour has failed to change the political landscape in any real sense. Even worse, it appears to see virtue in showing political virility by campaigning against its own supporters on issues such as foundation hospitals and top-up fees. </p> <p>The government's position is this: It has squandered the trust of the electorate to the extent where disillusionment is rife; it has so far failed to sketch out its own distinct ideology; it has failed to cash in on its economic record but is utterly dependent on the economy staying strong over the next six months. </p> <p>There is no immediate prospect of a recession, but growth is weakening, not strengthening, and there are at least half a dozen risks ahead. These are falling house prices, the size of the government's budget deficit, the weakness of productivity, the trade deficit, the squeeze on real incomes from rising petrol prices and dearer mortgages, and the loss of manufacturing jobs. </p> <p>Of these, the key ones are property, the budget deficit and real incomes. House prices are falling, and should they continue to do so that would only amplify the feelbad factor. Ditto the squeeze on real incomes from higher oil prices. </p> <p>Although any tax increases caused by the bigger than expected deficit would be delayed until the third term, that will not prevent the Conservatives banging on about it from here until polling day. If house prices are falling at the same time, Labour's poll lead, already small, could be completely eroded. So, it is no time for complacency. The election is not done and dusted. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:larry.elliott@theguardian.com\">larry.elliott@theguardian.com</a></p>"
