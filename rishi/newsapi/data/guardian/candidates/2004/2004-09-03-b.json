  "Martin Kettle (Let's stop Bush-bashing and listen to what he has to say, August 31) is right to reject the fashion for demonising President Bush. Bush's record in foreign affairs, however flawed, is an improvement on that of previous US presidents. Ronald Reagan supported Saddam and the Khmer Rouge and devastated Nicaragua. Bush snr betrayed the Iraqi resistance to Saddam - after having incited it to rise against him. Bill Clinton helped starve to death hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians through sanctions and destroyed a pharmaceutical factory supplying medicine to Sudan, one of the world's poorest countries. <p>By contrast, George W Bush has overthrown Saddam and the Taliban, helped prevent nuclear war between India and Pakistan, and is the first US president to acknowledge the necessity of democratising the Middle East. Bush's policies, despite Kyoto, the international criminal court and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, are little different from those which a Democratic president would have pursued. </p> <p>Bush is vilified for his unilateralism, but all this means is that he overthrew a fascist dictator without the approval of the so-called UN security council - a body consisting of Saddam's French allies, the Russian and Chinese oppressors of Chechnya and Tibet, and an assortment of third-world dictatorships. Well, if the alternative to Bush's unilateralism is a return to Clintonite multilateralism - which involved the west and the UN multilaterally colluding in the genocide of 800,000 Rwandans and tens of thousands of Bosnians - then Bush is clearly preferable. <br><b>Dr Marko Hoare</b><br> Cambridge </p> <p>The positive similarities between the Bush and Blair governments are significant: prosperous economies and record spending on the main public services (particularly health and education). Bush \"has been reinventing big government\"; Blair's government is also bigger than ever. </p> <p>But while, as Kettle says, globally \"the collapse of the socialist era ... is no longer disputed, save among a dwindling band of true believers\", within the Labour party, the band of true believers - despite an overall dwindling membership - is greater than ever and now wholly unable to permit the remotest notion of any Bush-Blair commonality. They stubbornly ignore the raft of social benefits associated with a common economic prosperity, even when delivered by what is essentially a common, anti-conservative, big-government approach. <br><b>Mike Allott</b><br> Eastleigh, Hants </p> <p>Timothy Garton Ash may find it obvious \"which America\" Europeans want to win (The world election, September 2), but it is not obvious in his depiction of two closely converged political parties vying with each other to avoid the issues. The only positively \"American\" campaign appears to be Ralph Nader's, rooted in a tradition of anti-monopoly and people's party insurgency against US machine politics and monopoly wealth.<br> <b>DBC Reed </b><br> Northampton </p> <p>As Jeremy Rifkin notes (Daring to dream, September 1), where Americans favour military force, Europeans prefer diplomacy and peacekeeping. Yet today's 25 EU states still have \"defence\" forces of over 1 million men and women, with budgets totalling \u20ac160bn; two are nuclear-weapon states. A European common security organisation would need far less resources if its aims were solely defence from (highly improbable) outside attack, and undertaking peacekeeping operations only when called on by the UN security council. </p> <p>Such a programme would be non-nuclear, otherwise Austria, Ireland, Sweden and others would not participate. Trident would be scrapped and much costly equipment made redundant. Billions would be freed for preventive diplomacy. <br><b>Dr Douglas Holdstock</b><br> Woking, Surrey</p>",
  "Only tumbleweed is missing from Shindand, an abandoned Soviet-era military base far inside the deserts of western Afghanistan. Rusting tanks and pillaged jet fighters are scattered across the vast compound, bleaching under the baking sun. <p>Inside one of the deserted offices, an Afghan general and his American counterpart sat eating grapes. They exuded an air of quiet triumph. \"The situation around here is improving day by day,\" said General Aminullah Ptyani, reaching for the fruit bowl. \"The time for war is over.\" Beside him, Lieutenant Colonel Mike Dunn, a US \"mentor\", nodded in agreement. </p> <p>A fortnight ago, they were far less certain. A bloody battle boomed across Shindand. Fighters loyal to the powerful provincial governor, Ismail Khan, were slugging it out with his bitter rival, the warlord Amanullah Khan. As the death toll mounted, the conflict threatened to tip over into a full-scale war - a disastrous development just weeks before the presidential elections on October 9. </p> <p>Then, Gen Aminullah and the newly trained Afghan national army intervened. More than 1,000 troops, accompanied by American advisers and a handful of special forces, landed in Shindand. They seized control of the airstrip, established a 15km (9.3 mile) buffer zone between the belligerents, and imposed peace. </p> <p>Since then, the ANA, bolstered by the Americans, is flexing its muscles in Herat in an effort to erode the influence of one of Afghanistan's most powerful warlords. </p> <p>The intervention is good news for the interim president, Hamid Karzai, who has sought for years to wrest control of Herat province from its wily Tajik overlord, Ismail Khan. Mr Khan, a mujahideen leader who likes to be called \"emir\", has dominated the ancient city for 25 years. But now his grip is looking increasingly slippery. </p> <p>To the surprise of many, Amanullah's forces pushed the governor's militia back to within 18 miles of the city. Shockingly, it appeared as if Herat could fall. The proud emir was forced to accept ANA help to save his city. </p> <p>Now predictions are mounting that the end of his reign is near. \"He looks finished. This is not about military strength any more. It's about political negotiations and face-saving,\" said one western diplomat. </p> <p>Mr Khan is one of Afghanistan's most powerful - and colourful - warlords. His power stems from popular appeal, military might and a firm grip on the purse-strings of the country's most lucrative border crossing. Herat is Afghanistan's gateway to Iran, which, according to a UN official, accounts for 80% of Afghanistan's imports. It also earns Mr Khan customs duties estimated at between $250,000 (\u00a3140,000) and $1.5m a day. </p> <p>Much to the frustration of the cash-strapped national government, only a fraction of the money gets to the treasury. But, unlike other Afghan warlords, Mr Khan has returned at least some of the money to his people. </p> <p>Herat sparkles as a centre of commerce in one of the world's poorest countries. It boasts broad new asphalt roads, public parks, libraries and Afghanistan's only 24-hour electricity supply, sourced in Iran. There are even plans to revive the tourist authority. </p> <p>\"Unlike most of these guys with access to revenue streams, he has done something with it,\" said Victor Parekh of the International Crisis Group. </p> <p>Mr Khan's caliph-like reputation is cemented by his famous weekly \"court\". Every week hundreds of supplicants crowd into an ornately decorated hall in the city centre for a personal audience with the snowy-bearded governor, who dispenses money, advice, divorces and decisions on family disputes. A team of officials mops up the administrative side; armed soldiers guard the door. </p> <p>But last Thursday morning, the governor's desk was empty while he took some advice of his own. Mr Khan was in a back room, meeting 60 tribal leaders summoned from across the province. Afterwards they filed out, towards a plane bound for Kabul. \"We are going to see President Karzai, to tell him that Ismail Khan is our spiritual leader and our hero. We support the transitional government, but only through him,\" said Muhammad Saqzai, who claimed to represent 30,000 families. </p> <p>Mr Khan denies he is against the ropes. During a midnight interview at a richly decorated office, he admitted losing at least 90 soldiers to the fighting, with another 44 missing and presumed dead. He blamed his misfortune on enemies within the government, who, he said, helped coordinate the attacks. \"It was not President Karzai, but members of his cabinet that were involved,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Khan confirmed that he had agreed to take a ministerial position in Kabul after the election. But \"only if there is security\". In a country awash with guns, and under attack from Taliban insurgents, that is a major \"if\". </p> <p>Many city residents support him. Unusually for a warlord, Mr Khan has banned the poppy trade, favouring legitimate commerce instead. And he has encouraged education for women, and now boasts that 150,000 of the city's 400,000 students are girls. </p> <p>\"Ismail Khan is a good ruler. He has provided parks, power, security and services to this city,\" said Yahya, a merchant selling sequin dresses in the shadow of the old city palace. \"Many of us appreciate that.\" </p> <p>But the emir's benevolence has come at a price. There is little political opposition, critics are beaten up, and the free press shut. In the most striking demonstration of Mr Khan's contempt for human rights, his bodyguards publicly beat up a critical journalist at the opening of the city's human rights commission last year. </p> <p>In the old city marketplace, a trader named Abdullah detailed the alleged corruption of Mr Khan's rule. When a stranger sidled alongside to eavesdrop, he abruptly changed the conversation. </p> <p>The election will almost certainly decide Mr Khan's fate. But he has enjoyed charmed escapes from tight spots before. In 1997, he dramatically escaped from a Taliban prison, sprung by sympathetic officials. As his getaway vehicle sped across the desert, it hit a landmine, but he escaped to Iran with just a broken leg. </p> <p>This time, pre-election deal-making could provide a way out. He has concealed his choice for the poll, and denies that the proliferation of posters in Herat for Yunus Qanooni - Mr Karzai's biggest rival - indicated his preference. </p> <p>\"Campaigning has not started,\" he said, preparing for another meeting after his midnight interview. \"So I have not decided yet.\"</p>",
  "George Bush may be riding a small swing in the polls as the American election officially gets under way - it would be surprising in the wake of his convention if he were not. The big picture, however, remains what it has been for many weeks. America's 2004 presidential election seems set to be one of the closest on record, perhaps even rivalling the astonishing contest of four years ago. Mr Bush capped off the Republican convention on Thursday with the kind of forward-looking speech, stressing statesmanlike themes, that any president who is running for a second term is bound to make. <p>Neither he nor his party will appreciate the comparison, but Mr Bush's speech contained echoes of Bill Clinton's equivalent address to the Chicago Democratic convention in 1996. That was where Mr Clinton, gradually recovering in the polls, promoted himself as the friend of change and as a president whose four-year experience of office equipped him to lead the nation onwards across \"the bridge to the 21st century\". That was the essence of Mr Bush's pitch this time too, and for much the same reason. Mr Bush has been behind in the polls too, and his message that his domestic policies could be \"transformational\" was aimed principally at the undecideds and independents. Whether Mr Bush can close the deal with those voters over the next 59 days is the key question in this campaign. </p> <p>Mr Bush talked more about policy and adopted a very different tone than most of the principal speakers in New York this week. This was mostly a nasty convention, in which the mean-spirited side of the Republican party was given full rein. By contrast with the Democratic convention in Boston a month ago, where there was a conscious decision to keep personal attacks on Mr Bush to a minimum, the Republicans showed little restraint. Many of the attacks were vicious - especially over Mr Kerry's military record - and downright untrue. But these speeches were not designed to attract the undecideds or the independents, but to rally the faithful and mobilise the core Republican electorate. </p> <p>Party conventions and conferences always serve this dual purpose - of pleasing the delegates while trying to woo the wider electorate. This week's convention, though, has been a particularly crude and shameless example of this twin-track strategy. At the grass-roots, the Republican party moves ever more confidently to the right, burnishing its Christian conservatism and its isolationism as it goes. This was made absolutely clear in the party programme adopted this week, with its firm commitments against legalised abortion and gay marriage; all passed on the nod to the delight of the delegates. On the surface, the message from New York is that America is safe in the hands of a genial, middle-of-the-road guy with the popular touch. If enough Americans fall for this pitch, then Mr Bush will win. Americans who are tempted should think again. Mr Bush stands for what his fundamentalist supporters are promoting. His is the smile on the face of one of the most ruthless political tigers of the modern age.</p>",
  "<p>Sean Harrigan has made some powerful enemies. As president of Calpers, the largest public pension fund in the United States, he has become a thorn in the side of corporate America, taking on some of its best-known and biggest egos. </p> <p>Earlier this year the fund locked horns with Michael Eisner, the beleaguered boss of Walt Disney, leading the call for his resignation. Calpers also played a pivotal role in the ousting of former New York Stock Exchange chief Dick Grasso as he became embroiled in a bitter dispute over his eye-popping salary. </p> <p>In April, the fund pressed other investors to back its campaign against Sanford Weill, the boss of Citigroup, the biggest banking firm in the world. Weill, Calpers said, \"should be held accountable\" for the numerous Wall Street scandals in which the bank played a role. With profits returning and the Citigroup share price heading up, few others agreed. He remains chairman. </p> <p>Among other head-on collisions, Calpers has filed a suit against Time Warner alleging fraud, and even withheld votes for the re-election of Warren Buffett to the board of Coca-Cola, inviting the opprobrium of America's favourite investor. The list, a who's who of the US business community, goes on. </p> <p>Calpers, an acronym for the California Public Employees' Retirement System, has a long history of shareholder activism - taking an active role in the companies it invests in instead of the traditional passive approach. It cites studies that show active share ownership improves both performance and share prices in the long term. With $170bn (\u00a395bn) under management, it wields the kind of power that directors take note of, whether they be at the exchange or corporations. In the year to June 30, it earned a return of 16.7%. </p> <p>The fund started to engage company management two decades ago when it embarked on a campaign to rid corporate America of \"poison pills\", the clauses adopted by boards to prevent takeovers. </p> <p>More recently, though, Calpers has redoubled its efforts in response to the unprecedented wave of financial scandals in the US. Amid the accounting woes at the likes of Enron, WorldCom, Tyco and Adelphia, the fraud uncovered at mutual funds and the widespread sleaze at Wall Street's biggest banks, Calpers has emerged as corporate America's self-styled moral compass. </p> <p>\"I think we are probably the most active fund in the US; one of the most active in the world,\" Harrigan says. \"We believe very strongly that first of all it does enhance long-term value of our investments but secondly, if we don't do it, who will? We are the largest in the US and as a result of being the largest I think we have a responsibility.\" </p> <p><strong>Focus list</strong><br> </p> <p>As the firestorm raged last summer over the $188m compensation package paid to Grasso at the New York Stock Exchange, Calpers exercised that responsibility and waded in. Grasso had been resisting intense pressure to quit. Calpers held a press conference demanding that he step down and within 24 hours he was gone. </p> <p>Harrigan is still aghast. \"It was outrageous,\" he says. \"Here you have the largest stock exchange in the world that should set the absolute right example. Then you've got a guy like Dick Grasso who's got this $188m package. I said it as clearly as I could: it was an example of the pig being in the trough and our job was to get him out of the trough.\" </p> <p>The other tangible success for Calpers this year has been Disney. Led by Calpers, shareholders who were frustrated by the poor performance of the entertainment and media group withheld an unprecedented 43% of the vote for Eisner's re-election to the board. Disney, which had stubbornly defended Eisner, reacted swiftly, stripping him of the chairmanship although leaving him as chief executive. </p> <p>Harrigan says Calpers was pleased by the size of the withheld vote but still describes Disney as a work in progress. </p> <p>\"I was disappointed that the board would be naive enough to believe that splitting the role of chairman and chief executive would satisfy our concerns because we think that action will have no impact whatsoever on Disney's performance. Eisner is the problem, and there's only one way to correct that problem.\" </p> <p>The fund's attention more lately has turned to Royal Dutch/Shell, where Calpers is engaged in efforts to reform the board. Like Disney, Shell is on Calpers' annual \"focus list\", which identifies the biggest problem companies. The other two on this year's list are home appliance maker Maytag and engineering firm Emerson Electric. </p> <p>Shell was sent reeling earlier this year by a series of downgrades to its oil and gas reserves that led to the departure of several top executives. Calpers, however, is dissatisfied with the pace of change at the company and the transparency of its review process. It is putting pressure on Shell to follow through with proposals to simplify its complex dual-board structure. The company has not been \"particularly responsive\", Harrigan says. </p> <p>\"We aren't convinced of Shell's commitment to reform. We have some real concerns about Shell's performance but more importantly about its structure. It's hard to even figure out who you need to be talking to at Shell. We will continue to have a dialogue but they have a long way to go.\" </p> <p>As Calpers has pressed harder, though, corporate America has begun to push back. The resistance appears to be part of a wider business retreat from the rules and regulations put in place to improve standards of corporate governance in the wake of the Enron collapse. </p> <p>The Business Roundtable, a powerful coalition of US chief executives, and the national chamber of commerce have both launched bitter attacks on the Californian pension fund, arguing that the corporate governance movement is out of control. \"This is not about good corporate governance,\" the head of the Business Roundtable, John Castellani, recently said. \"This is hysteria being driven by union-dominated pension funds. They are wrapping themselves in the cloak of corporate governance to gain power and influence.\" </p> <p>The Californian Republican party has also gone on the offensive, accusing the Democrat-dominated Calpers board of political grandstanding. Most of the pension funds that have backed Calpers, including New York and New Jersey, are from Democratic states. </p> <p>Harrigan, a blunt-speaking union boss, appears resigned to the criticism. Detractors, he replies, are trying to \"protect the status quo\" by discrediting the fund. \"You have to try and assess the motives of the people who are making those observations,\" he says. \"If someone was to poll the average American on whether they believe executive compensation is totally out of line, recognising it was 40 times the average wage for a production worker in 1980 and 520 times that last year, I think the average American probably lines up with Calpers. </p> <p>\"Then you look at the fraud and what impact that has had on workers and pension funds and what has gone on in corporate boardrooms. What has happened over the past four years has been absolutely despicable and the criticism of Calpers comes predominantly from individuals who have benefited greatly as a result of the excesses and the lack of accountability that have taken place. </p> <p>\"I certainly understand their motivation. While I don't agree with it, I guess if I had enjoyed the sanctimony of the positions that they've enjoyed over the last 60 years I might be inclined to protect the status quo also.\" </p> <p>Critics have seized on Calpers' stance on auditors. The fund last year decided to withhold votes for re-election to the board for any members of audit committees that allowed accounting companies to provide other services, such as tax or management consulting, potentially compromising their independence. </p> <p>A key finding in the Enron and WorldCom scandals was that auditors were simply too much in the thrall of their clients. Calpers' analysis suggested that 29% of fees still come from consulting services. </p> <p>The problem was more pervasive than Calpers realised. It resulted in the fund withholding votes from directors at 90% of the companies it owns shares in, including Buffett at Coke and Steve Jobs at Apple, provoking widespread ridicule. Buffett described the vote as plain \"silly\". The Wall Street Journal said the \"withhold\" against Buffett was taking governance reform to \"absurd new lengths\". </p> <p>Harrigan responds: \"Buffet is a great investor, he really is. Is he a great advocate of proper levels of checks and balances in terms of corporate governance? I don't think that is his strong point. We weren't suggesting those members be removed from the board. We were making a statement about how important we think it is that you draw a bright line between audit and non-audit related services.\" </p> <p>The criticisms appear to have had an effect. Calpers is unlikely to continue the aggressive stance on auditors and will set out a more selective policy in October or November. \"Some people think we did the right thing, some people think we did the wrong thing. I don't know. I think we made a lot of noise. This is the first time we've done it. Maybe what we did was absolutely the right thing to do for the first proxy season. Maybe now we need to look at refining it.\" </p> <p><strong>Overseas targets</strong><br> </p> <p>The fund's next big focus will be executive compensation, an incendiary issue on both sides of the Atlantic. Calpers is planning a separate focus list of the most egregious cases of excessive pay which will be published later this year or early next. </p> <p>Harrigan says Calpers will also focus more efforts on shaking up poorly managed companies overseas, including Britain - it was part of the failed revolt against James Murdoch's accession at BSkyB. Calpers was a founding member in May of the International Forum for Active Shareowners to encourage more cross-border cooperation and holds about 25% of its equities outside the US. </p> <p>Harrigan judges the most important imminent issue for investors in the US to be the so-called access to the proxy. </p> <p>At present, US shareholders have no means of ousting directors. But, under a rule being considered by the securities and exchange commission, shareholders will be able to nominate an alternative for a board position if more than 35% of the vote is withheld from him or her in the previous year. Corporate America and, Harrigan suspects, the Bush administration are lobbying hard against the rule being adopted. </p> <p>Opponents argue it will be a Trojan horse, allowing special interest groups to find a way on to boards, something Harrigan describes as \"bunk\". </p> <p>\"This is huge,\" he says. \"It is the one issue that I believe has the potential of aligning interests of shareholders and management. It has the potential to create an environment in which we don't see the kind of fraud we saw at Enron and WorldCom and has the potential of making sure that executive compensation is reasonable and tied directly to performance. Without question, it is the issue that has the potential for creating the kind of environment that we think needs to be created in the boardrooms of American corporations.\" </p> <p>If it is passed, Eisner at least could face a genuine fight for survival next year. </p> <p><strong>The CV</strong></p> <p><strong>Age:</strong> 57<br> <strong>Education:</strong> Economics degree, Whitman College, Washington State<br> <strong>Career:</strong> 30 years' experience in the supermarket sector, including seven years at Safeway Supermarkets; joined Union of Food and Commercial Workers in mid-1970s, specialising in member recruitment, collective bargaining; director of field operations, coordinator of activities relating to 2000 national presidential election, UFCW; international vice president and executive director, UFCW; February 2003, president, Calpers board of administration<br> <strong>Family:</strong> Wife Kathy, children Kathleen and Ryan<br> <strong>Interests:</strong> Golf, sailing</p>",

  "<p>As ever, it's the economy, stupid. The presidential candidates' rhetoric may be primarily about Iraq, but Americans will vote according to their personal financial swingometers. Wall Street has cottoned on. Market moves are determined, day to day, by the latest slivers of information on the US electorate's domestic well-being. </p> <p>Trading in financial markets has become very mannered in recent months. The summer is usually a period of low activity levels. However, prices often fluctuate wildly during the holiday season - thin volumes exaggerating the effect of any news items. This year, though, volatility and volume have been extremely low - apart from at the times of set piece announcements of US economic statistics. </p> <p>As volumes have shrunk and asset prices tracked sideways, each economic release from the authorities has assumed increased importance. Foreign exchange traders, as an example, traditionally view their working weeks and months as determined by the calendar of forthcoming releases. Now trading might as well be suspended between these pinnacles of activity as the economic data currently has such an arm-lock on the FX market. </p> <p>This control has been established in part simply because a presidential election is approaching, but more importantly because both the outcome of that election and the direction of the American economy are in such doubt. As in 2000, a few votes either way (whether correctly or incorrectly counted) could determine the context. So, a few jobs created or lost in America's industrial heartlands could make all the difference. </p> <p>Michael Moore's screen polemic Fahrenheit 9/11 is chilling in many ways. The scene that stands out for me, though, is neither the sea of bloody images of war nor George Bush's gurning, but of military personnel trawling a Hicksville shopping mall car park for potential recruits. Here is the heart of many of America's social and economic problems. Here, also, were floating voters, if only the thought of voting ever crossed their minds. </p> <p>A Republican president may have a core vote of the well-off who trust their leader to protect them from the chronically unemployed and disadvantaged in that Hicksville mall. A Democrat challenger may strive to mobilise the votes of those disadvantaged people. In between there will always be those who feel weighed down by fear of what lies below and - in that classically American way - in thrall to the dream of self-improvement. </p> <p>Weekly jobless claims figures and monthly payroll data provide a numerical snapshot of the hopes and fears of these middle Americans. It is no coincidence that the monthly non-farm payrolls release, the benchmark employment statistic, has recently become by far and away the most important in the financial markets' calendar. </p> <p>This is, of course, a gross oversimplification of electoral dynamics, but it is one that the politicians themselves and their pollsters clearly subscribe to. One problem the candidates have is that neither can really lay a glove on the other on economic issues - largely because there is no black and white in this debate. So much easier to trade blows over war records (macro and individual) where there are at least substantive differences of fact, recollection and stance to dispute. </p> <p>Bush has presided over an adequate economy. It has grown solidly while inflation and interest rates have kept low. Growth has not really been sufficient to create swaths of new jobs so that, while the recovery has not been jobless, it has certainly been joyless. The geopolitical backdrop has not helped; 9/11 threatened recession, which triggered ultra-low interest rates, which in turn provided a stimulus that to industry always felt fragile - too fragile to warrant much job creation. </p> <p>The economic work was largely the Federal Reserve's. The monetary authority did just as good a job for Clinton as for Bush and there is nothing to suggest it would do anything less for John Kerry. President Bush's contribution was his much-criticised tax cuts for America's wealthiest. There is little evidence to suggest that these have alienated the swing voters as much as they have commentators. </p> <p>It seems incredible that there should be so much to play for economically with only two months until polling, but that does indeed appear to be the case. Over the summer the balance of economic news in the US has pointed to cooling growth rates. Consumer (for which read voter) confidence has fallen sharply. But after Labor Day America's economy traditionally fires back up. The economic data released in the final few weeks before polling will reveal just how strong this seasonal effect is this year. </p> <p>The Federal Reserve has one more opportunity to affect the election outcome, meeting to discuss the level of interest rates on September 21. Things are so finely balanced, though, that it is unclear whether the Republicans would prefer a rate rise, indicating a normal recovery, or none, promising continued stimulus. The answer lies in the butterflies of economic insecurity that beat in the gut of America's workforce. Only time will tell us how fast their wings are beating. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Edmond Warner is chief executive of IFX Group </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:edmond.warner@theguardian.com\">edmond.warner@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "John Kerry launched a stinging and personal counter-attack against George Bush's administration, singling out Dick Cheney, the vice-president, for having \"refused to serve\" in Vietnam. <p>The ferocity of the Democratic party's presidential challenger at the midnight rally of supporters in Ohio marked a sharp change in his campaign tactics. A few hours earlier, at the Republican party convention in New York, President Bush had joined in Mr Cheney's derision of Senator Kerry as a vacillating liberal. </p> <p>The president repeated those charges yesterday at a rally in Pennsylvania, lampooning Mr Kerry for voting to go to war in Iraq and then opposing a funding request in the Senate for the occupation. </p> <p>\"He said he was proud of his vote, and then he just said the whole thing was a complicated matter. His words,\" Mr Bush said. \"Here are my words: There's nothing complicated about supporting our troops in combat.\" </p> <p>The charge that Mr Kerry was \"unfit for command\" was a main theme of the Republican convention, provoking outrage from the senator. He said: \"I'm not going to have my commitment to defend this country questioned by those who refused to serve when they could have, and by those who misled the nation into Iraq.\" </p> <p>Mr Kerry's seemed to be using his speech to release months of pent-up anger. </p> <p>In the face of a campaign by rightwing Vietnam war veterans to question whether he merited his five combat medals, the senator had until yesterday refrained from referring directly to the actions of Mr Bush or Mr Cheney during the Vietnam era. </p> <p>Both men avoided combat, while the young Lieutenant Kerry was fighting in the Mekong Delta. Mr Bush signed up with the Texas air national guard as a pilot; Mr Cheney was granted five deferments from the draft for attending college, then graduate school and finally for having a child. </p> <p>The new gloves-off strategy begins after a week of debate and unease within the Kerry camp over the wisdom of restraint. It coincided with the hiring of Joe Lockhart, a former spokesman for Bill Clinton with a combative reputation. </p> <p>In yesterday's speech Mr Kerry made it clear he was aiming his accusations principally at the vice-president, who had used his Wednesday night speech to portray the Democratic candidate as unfit to be commander in chief. </p> <p>Mr Kerry responded: \"I'll leave it up to the voters to decide whether five deferments makes someone more qualified to defend this nation than two tours of duty. </p> <p>\"Let me tell you what I think makes someone unfit for duty: misleading our nation into war in Iraq makes you unfit to lead this nation. Doing nothing while this nation loses millions of jobs makes you unfit to lead this nation ... That's the record of George Bush and Dick Cheney\" </p> <p>He also implied that the vice-president was guilty of a financial conflict of interests, accusing him of handing out contracts to his former employer, the oil services company Halliburton, \"while you're still on their payroll\". </p> <p>Mr Cheney continues to receive annual payments of \"deferred compensation\" from Halliburton for his past work as its chief executive, but the White House has denied that he had any role in awarding the company contracts in Iraq. </p> <p>Mr Kerry's tough approach satisfied his cheering supporters but it carries inherent risks for a candidate claiming to be more capable than the president of unifying the US. </p> <p>Some pundits also wondered whether Mr Kerry had left his counter-attack too late. </p> <p>\"We're at the point now where all's fair in love and war, and politics is war,\" said Larry Sabato, a political science professor at the University of Virginia. \"The problem is Kerry is out of synch. The time for this was a month ago, but it came on a night when all the coverage went to Bush's speech. I find it incredibly odd.\" </p> <p>Both sides argued over the significance of new employment figures published yesterday showing a net creation of 144,000 jobs in August. </p> <p>The total was a little below most projections but still up on July. Speaking at a rally in Pennsylvania, Mr Bush said the figures showed that the economy was growing, and he added the catchphrase he used when accepting the Republican presidential nomination on Thursday: \"Nothing will hold us back.\"</p>",
  "The books used to talk about how the American Republican party was really two parties. The first of them was very decent and sometimes very grand indeed, and could answer truthfully to the term compassionate conservative. It was the party of Theodore Roosevelt and Nelson Rockefeller. The second party was decent too, in its way, but it was decidedly not so grand as the first. It was the party of people like Dwight Eisenhower and, stretching a point, Richard Nixon. <p>Identifiable traces of these two mid-20th century parties, particularly the latter, still live on in George Bush's Republican party of 2004. But they survive there on sufferance, in a transformed party. Even so, you could argue that the Republicans of today are still based on a kind of alliance, though the new one bears no relation to the old. The first arm, which has all of the power and most of the dynamism, is the religious conservative activist party that gathered in Madison Square Garden this week to acclaim Bush, now himself the de facto leader of the religious right. The second, still necessary to the first for purely electoral reasons, consists of people who vote Republican in the belief that the party is as nice as it portrays itself, when in fact it is no such thing. </p> <p>One needs to beware of applying the political mores of one culture to those of another. Even so, there was no mistaking the sheer aggressiveness of the Republicans this week. This quality showed above all in the treatment reserved for John Kerry, who was subjected to a four-day stream of orches trated personal insult that makes British politics appear truly gentlemanly by comparison. Nothing that happens in a convention hall happens without the party managers' approval. Every placard they wave has been handed out by party officials a few minutes before. So the sudden outbreak of delegates wearing sticking plasters with Purple Hearts on them - implying that Kerry exaggerated his Vietnam wounds in order to win his medals - could hardly have been an unofficial move either, and stands in marked contrast to earlier denials by the Bush campaign that it was promoting the apparently \"non-partisan\" anti-Kerry moves by rightwing Vietnam veterans. </p> <p>Of course, it was not an unofficial move at all. What the delegates expressed with their nasty stickers, the party's leaders actually said, just as nastily, from the platform. Speech after speech besmirched Kerry's military record - a record which he had placed at the centre of his own campaign in an explicit bid for electoral credibility both as a man and as a potential president - none more brutally than the Georgia Democratic senator Zell Miller, who cast Kerry as \"wrong, weak and wobbly\" and as a man with a \"yes-no-maybe\" approach to the war on terrorism. </p> <p>In a truly revealing turn of events, after years in which rightwing America has endlessly celebrated the unquiet Vietnam veterans as a betrayed generation of real male patriots, mainstream Republican demonology has now cast Kerry as a man whose preoccupation with his own exploits in Vietnam make him fundamentally unreliable both as man and potential leader. The fact that rightwing America can so shamelessly taunt Kerry in this way, led by a non-combatant president who refuses to condemn the negative campaign and by a vice-president who fanned the flames in his own speech this week (\"I had other priorities\" is how Cheney icily describes his own Vietnam years) is a reminder that what is crucially important to Republicans is not, as they like to say, the tradition of armed service but, in reality, their claim to exclusive ownership of the politics of US defence, security and war. </p> <p>Throughout the week, it goes almost without saying, there was not a single critical reference to the American military, not even in relation to Abu Ghraib. Bush himself probably saw no element of irony in his closing encomium of \"our military which finds a way, or makes one\". Such self-confidence reminds us how much more vicious American politics since 9/11 would have been if Al Gore had been in the White House when the hijacked planes were flown into the World Trade Centre. Would the Republicans have rallied behind Gore as the Democrats rallied behind Bush that day? Not a chance. Within days they would have begun to blame Bill Clinton for the attack on America. Some of them, indeed, do so anyway. Browsing through a New York Barnes and Noble bookstore the other day I encountered titles like \"Losing Bin Laden: How Bill Clinton's Failures Unleashed Global Terror\", \"Dereliction of Duty: The Eyewitness Account of How Bill Clinton compromised American's National Security\" or \"Intelligence Failure: How Clinton's National Security Policy Set the Stage for 9/11\". </p> <p>For such people, the mere act of imagining John Kerry as their duly elected \"commander-in-chief\" is offensive. Miller and others have said as much. Cheney, in the speech of great ruthlessness, went further than most. And again, all this provides a glimpse of the vengeful and vindictive way that a defeated Republican party might be tempted to treat a President Kerry. The Republican party today is not at ease in any settlement other than one whose terms it has dictated. You can already sense the impeachment reflex beginning to take on life. </p> <p>In some ways it is as though the modern Republican party has become the political expression of the \"misplaced power\" of the military-industrial complex against which Eisenhower famously warned as he left the White House in 1961. </p> <p>In any other political culture, you would characterise the Republicans as a militarist party, and in that context it would be perverse not to reflect upon whether this central development in American life did not have far more sinister implications, not least when so many references to the war on terror this week have been accompanied by testosterone-fuelled chants of \"U-S-A, U-S-A\". </p> <p>Yet the Republican party which Bush leads should really be seen as the party that tries to unite the military-industrial and religious imperatives in American life. If Bush was careful this week not to take the attacks on Kerry too far, he was much less restrained in his meticulous willingness to tick each of the boxes that matter to the religious party he now leads. </p> <p>But it was not merely his comments about the unborn child and gay marriage that marked this key role. Time and again Bush also deployed his well-established \"double-coding\" technique, dotting his speech with remarks which may not sound to the uninitiated as though they have a Christian conservative meaning, but which initiates will easily read differently. </p> <p>\"We must win this culture war,\" the Republican senator Sam Brownback told a private Family, Faith and Freedom rally in New York this week. For many in Bush's party, this is now the central task of a second term. \"We ask that you continue to provide strength to President Bush and the first family,\" intoned the blessing with which the final convention evening began. \"Guide, protect, and grant wisdom to him as he leads America and the world against the forces of evil ... And father, we pray your will is accomplished in this convention and throughout this great country.\" Much of what was said in Madison Square Garden this week was a masterpiece of Orwellian double-speak. A few things, on the other hand, meant exactly what they said. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:martin.kettle@theguardian.com\">martin.kettle@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "George W Bush emerged between two gigantic American flags, walked down a runway to the centre of a stage emblazoned with the seal of the presidency. The proscenium behind him resembled a Roman temple, engraved with large gold letters: \"The United States of America.\" <p>The overpowering evidence of his authority did not foster distance between him and the crowd; instead his elevation excited charismatic deference. Standing alone on the image of the American eagle, he was thrust on his podium physically both amid and above the rapturous delegates at the Republican convention. His solitary presence brought him closer to them in fulfilling their dream of leadership - the president as lone ranger. </p> <p>Bush has always benefited from what he calls in another context \"the soft bigotry of low expectations\". The dismissals of him as stupid, crude and impulsive allow the widest play for his well-planned and sophisticated shrewdness. The spoiled son of privilege, who gained admission to Yale as a favour of legacy to his family, sloughed off his military service, was indifferent to the intricacies of international affairs that compelled the career of his father, and a failure in business until salvaged by family friends, has in fact been a diligent student in one crucial area. </p> <p>The field in which he is expert is politics. Assimilating by osmosis its lessons in a political family, he was apprenticed, beginning in his early 20s, to the most talented and slyest southern political consultants who were the innovators of the post-civil rights southern strategy, becoming their equal. Part of his cleverness lies in hiding this true identity. </p> <p>Bush's acceptance speech was intended in part to present the gloss of a \"vision\" of domestic policy. Until this moment, he had avoided laying out any programme beyond his adherence to the social agenda of the religious right on gay marriage, stem cell research and abortion. </p> <p>His tax cuts have fostered a wildly burgeoning deficit that he steadfastly refuses to address for fear of repeating the nightmare of his father's rescinding of his principal promise: \"Read my lips - no new taxes.\" Bush's \"Leave No Child Behind\" education initiative, which was fashioned as the signature programme of his \"compassionate conservatism\", is crushing the schools and desperately unpopular, even in the most conservative states such as Utah. The policy demands adherence to certain standards of performance, but Bush has refused to provide the $27bn in necessary funding. His Medicare programme for prescription drugs for seniors, a partial privatisation, has older voters up in arms. </p> <p>In his speech, Bush seized upon shards of Clintonism about helping workers cope with the impact of globalisation to offer the bleached bones of old Republicanism - privatisation schemes on social security and Medicare. He attached no price tag to these plans that policy experts calculate will cost trillions of dollars and detonate further explosions in the deficit. But this portion of the speech was the tribute Bush had to pay to his blank page on domestic accomplishment, his bow to the many. </p> <p>For him, 9/11 is the casus belli of his presidency. It is the beginning, middle and end of the drama - the moment when the enemy enters and calls forth the hero. Fear and uncertainty demand his absolute conviction. The hero stands tall and defiant, doing whatever it takes. </p> <p>\"Nothing will hold us back,\" Bush said repeatedly. Every action is seen in the light of 9/11. \"Do I forget the lessons of September 11 and take the word of a madman?\" he asked the crowd, referring to Saddam Hussein. \"No!\" \"Or do I take action to defend our country?\" </p> <p>But even this defence of his strategy of pre-emption was not the most revelatory section of his speech. Now Bush described his \"flaws\": some have to \"correct my English\" and sometimes \"I come across as a little too blunt\". Plain-speaking and honest, he is a natural man. \"Some folks look at me,\" he said, \"and see a certain swagger, which in Texas is called 'walking'.\" </p> <p>With this Bush cast himself as the born cowboy. Suddenly the war on terrorism was folded into the myth of the frontier and its stories of captivity and battles with savages. The hero is the rescuer and avenger, an isolate caught in a moral landscape between civilisation and wilderness. In this primal struggle, the savages use cruel methods to terrorise the settlers, even taking hostages. Law and chaos rage in conflict. </p> <p>In the 19th century novels of James Fenimore Cooper, such as the Last of the Mohicans, Hawkeye, the frontier hero, knows the savages and their ways. Part of what makes him a hero is that he is an unassuming natural man, in touch with the primitive, who has lived among them, putting him beyond the rigid hierarchies of the town. Because of his intimate knowledge he can use the methods of the savages against them. </p> <p>In Western iconography, the lineage runs from Hawkeye to Buffalo Bill, from the Lone Ranger to George W Bush. But the danger for the Lone Ranger is that without friends like Tonto he may become General Custer. Instead of achieving a bonanza, he may find himself through rash judgment surrounded at Little Big Horn, or Mesopotamia. For now, though, with \"a certain swagger,\" Bush gets his convention bump. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Sidney Blumenthal is a former senior adviser to Bill Clinton, and Washington bureau chief of <a href=\"http://www.salon.com\">salon.com</a></p> <p><a href=\"mailto:sidney_blumenthal@yahoo.com\">sidney_blumenthal@yahoo.com</a></p>",
  "<p>Across the pond, the Republicans are slinging all kinds of mud at John Kerry - they say he's a coward, they say he's privileged, they say he looks like the evil professor from Re-Animator (and he does) ... but perhaps their most damning allegation is that he's a \"flip-flopper\". He sometimes changes his mind! What a rubbish loser!</p> <p>Apparently, with great power comes great responsibility, and with great responsibility comes great pig-headedness; the need to make decisions and stick by them - even when it's clear you're wrong, and your soldiers are dying and hospitals are being bombed into the ground and the entire world has grown to despise you.</p> <p>Which is why I'd make a useless prime minister. My mind changes all the time. Usually without my permission. I was reminded of this for two reasons while watching bozos-run-the-country simulation-fest <strong>Crisis Command</strong> (Sun, 9pm, BBC2). </p> <p>Firstly, because the contestants are called upon to make decisive, hard-nosed decisions every few minutes, and secondly because its subject matter (a bio-terror incident of horrifying proportions) is similar to the third series of 24, which I wrote off earlier this year, and have just spent an entire weekend rather sheepishly glued to (I was wrong - after a slow start it suddenly became absolutely magnificent: rent or buy the DVD right now).</p> <p>Anyway, Crisis Command: in case you didn't see the pilot, it's essentially pornography for paranoid news junkies; a gameshow in which a panel of managerial types from everyday life (who are presumably used to making tough decisions, like which secretary to goose next) get to \"run the country\" for an hour during a simulated crisis.</p> <p>It boils down to a series of agonising multiple-choice questions. Will you quarantine the plague-sufferers? Or line them up and shoot them? It's that cheery. The correct decision usually turns out to be the most brutal - start agonising over whether or not you should send in the army and it all goes tits up (diseased tits in this case).</p> <p>Bearing this in mind, it's easy to play along at home. I thrashed the panel simply by choosing the grimmest option at every turn. You'd better pray I never get into power, because at the first hint of, say, an anti-me demonstration, I'd be razing cities to the ground and ordering the televised execution of any and all dissenters. Which is probably what'll be happening in America some time round 2006 if \"flip-floppin\" Kerry doesn't get in.</p> <p>Sticking with America, that's the setting for the new \"critically acclaimed cult show\" <strong>Carnivale</strong> (Sun, 9pm, FX 289): depression-era Oklahoma, to be precise. Episode one opens in the middle of a barren dustbowl, and never crawls really out: it's the slowest, least involving, most pretentious and downright tedious show I've seen in a long while. It's like sitting in a hot, stuffy waiting room listening to a Peter Gabriel concept album playing half-speed on a Walkman.</p> <p>The plot involves a travelling freakshow, replete with bearded ladies, Siamese twins, fortune tellers and an enigmatic dwarf. On paper, that sounds quite good, but no: the writers are so concerned with being cultsy and artsy, they've forgotten to make any of the characters likable or interesting. And the story unfolds at such a glacial, concentration-taunting pace, you're unlikely to make it to the end without wondering whether there's something better on the other side, then flipping over and discovering that yes, there is (even when it turns out to be Hamster Roulette on Avago TV).</p> <p>By the way, that dwarf? He's the same one who turned up during the backward \"dream\" segments of Twin Peaks, except here he's elevated to a starring role (well, as \"elevated\" as he can ever be), which consists of waddling around with a conceited grin on his face, dispensing rubbish aphorisms and generally looking \"weird\" and \"wise\". Vertically-challenged or not, I guarantee you'll want to smash his tiny face in by the end of episode one.</p>",
  "The US president, George Bush, was transferred to the Alabama national guard during the Vietnam war because his drunken behaviour was a political liability to his father in Texas, the wife of one of his father's former confidants revealed yesterday. <p>Linda Allison told the political website salon.com that throughout the time Mr Bush was in Alabama she never saw him in uniform and had no idea he was supposed to be in the national guard.</p> <p>\"Georgie was raising a lot of hell in Houston, getting in trouble and embarrassing the family and they just really wanted to get him out of Houston.\" Asked if she had ever seen him in uniform Mrs Allison said: \"Good Lord, no.

Mr Bush Sr was the US ambassador to the UN at the time and his son's drunken and occasionally loutish behaviour was becoming an embarrassment.</p> <p>Mr Allison agreed to take the errant Bush son as his deputy in a Senate campaign to elect the Alabama Republican Winton \"Red\" Blount. Once he had an official reason to be in Alabama, Mr Bush Jr transferred from the Texas national guard to its Alabama counterpart, although beyond one dental examination there is no proof that he showed up for any service, even though it was only a part-time posting. Mr Bush was subsequently given an honourable discharge.</p> <p>Most involved in the Senate campaign recall Mr Bush Jr turning up late, boasting about how much alcohol he had drunk the night before and then going home early. \"After about a month I asked Jimmy what was Georgie's job, because I could never figure it out,\" recalled Mrs Allison. \"I never saw him do anything.\"</p>",

  "The senior representative in Sicily of Silvio Berlusconi's rightwing coalition has been charged with aiding and abetting the mafia. <p>A two-year investigation concluded that the island's governor, Salvatore Cuffaro, passed on secret information he knew would be of vital interest to an alleged Cosa Nostra don. </p> <p>Mr Cuffaro has denied the charges and his party said it was standing by him. </p> <p>A spokesman in Sicily for the party, the Union of Centre Democrats (UDC), said the governor had passed up an opportunity to acquire immunity by declining to stand as a candidate in this year's European assembly elections. </p> <p>Italy's biggest opposition group, the Democratic Left, said the governor should resign. </p> <p>The UDC is the third biggest of the four main parties in Mr Berlusconi's governing coalition.

  "The former US president Bill Clinton has checked into a New York hospital for an emergency heart bypass operation, US news networks reported today. <p>CNN reported that the former Democratic president was undergoing tests at New York Presbyterian hospital after suffering chest pains. ABC and CBS television said Mr Clinton would be undergoing quadruple heart bypass surgery. </p> <p>CNN quoted a source close to the 58-year-old as saying the operation could take place as early as tomorrow. Other sources confirmed that he had cancelled a two-day joint trip across New York state with his wife, Senator Hillary Clinton, due to medical issues. </p> <p>Former press secretary George Stephanopoulous told ABC News that Mr Clinton had been treated for acid reflux disease while he was in the White House. However, he said there had never been any indication that the ex-president could have had a heart condition. </p> <p>Mr Stephanopoulous said: \"He consistently did get good, solid physicals when he was in the White House.

  "<p>The US president, George Bush, received a boost to his reelection hopes today as America's jobs market was shown to have bounced back in August after a couple of disappointing months.</p> <p>The labour department said employers added 144,000 workers to their payrolls last month and revised totals upwards for the two prior months. While hardly a resounding number, the August jobs figures will come as a relief to the White House, which has been under attack for a lacklustre labour market.</p> <p>The number of new jobs in August came in slightly below Wall Street forecasts, which were for a gain of 150,000 jobs, but the department also revised up its totals for June and July job creation by 59,000. </p> <p>The new figures created a moderately more favourable picture for summer job growth, with just one more employment report due before the November 2 election. Despite strong growth, the economy has failed to generate more jobs than it has lost under Mr Bush.</p> <p>\"The net outcome was better than expected. It's not that 144,000 is an especially strong number, but it does at least provide hope that the 'soft patch' may be fading,\" said Ian Morris, an economist with HSBC.</p> <p>Since August 2003, the economy has created 1.7m jobs after shedding about 2.7m during the recession and painful recovery. Indeed, Mr Bush may have the dubious honour of being the first US leader since Herbert Hoover, in the 1930s, to preside over an economy that has seen a net of loss of jobs in a four-year term.</p> <p>During the Republican convention, Mr Bush and other Republican speakers kept the focus clearly away from the economy, preferring to hone in on the \"war on terror\", a tacit admission that the president's economic record is nothing to boast about. </p> <p>That is why today's figures will come as welcome news for the White House. In addition to a reasonable number of new jobs, the unemployment rate fell 0.1% to 5.4%, the lowest figure since October 2001. Payroll additions in June and July were revised higher by a cumulative 59,000, with July's gain revised from a shockingly low 32,000, to 73,000. </p> <p>Still, economists were left unimpressed by today's data.</p> <p>\"The fact remains that the last three months have brought non-farm payroll gains of just 133,000, 73,000 and 144,000 - well below the 200,000-plus that is considered indicative of fast economic growth. Add in this week's fall in consumer confidence and recent slippages in business surveys, and you have a pretty average outlook for the autumn,\" said Andrij Halushka, an economist with the British thinktank the Centre for Economics and Business Research.</p> <p>The president's re-election team must have been hoping for stronger growth to cement its claim that the economy is \"strong and getting stronger\" thanks to the Bush tax cuts. But 12 straight months of payroll growth - albeit modest - may be enough of an economic achievement in what promises to be a close election.</p>",
  "Last November, in the final throes of the New England fall, my best friend Josephine Ross was driving her son to school in her Honda stickshift. (She always drives a manual rather than an automatic, to conserve fuel. In today's America, even the car you drive is a political statement.) The news came over the car radio. The Massachusetts supreme judicial court had made a majority ruling: \"We declare that barring an individual from the protections, benefits and obligations of civil marriage solely because that person would marry a member of the same sex violates the Massachusetts constitution.\" Within six months, Jo's home state would become the first in America to grant civil marriage licences to gay and lesbian couples. Jo, 46, and her son Sam, 13, whooped with joy. Jo, who has a celebratory disco song to belt out for every occasion, began, \"It started with a kiss. Never thought it would come to this ... \" and Sam joined in. <p>That evening, as Jo came down the stairs, her partner of 21 years, Christine Guilfoy, was waiting on her knees. \"Will you marry me?\" she asked. Jo replied, \"Yes, yes, yes, yes !\" So last month, I flew to America, and there I was, giving a blessing at their wedding. </p> <p>One hundred and fifty guests lined the long wooden pews of the Universalist church in the small fishing port of Gloucester. Jo is Jewish and Chris was raised a Catholic, so they were married under a huppah (the traditional Jewish wedding tent) with the taut and wiry Rabbi Karen Landy and the avuncular Reverend Wendy Fitting presiding, two clergy from central casting. (They couldn't marry in a synagogue not because they are women - liberal and reform synagogues premit same-sex marriages - but because Chris isn't Jewish.) </p> <p>When Massachusetts first recognised same-sex marriages, there was an unseemly rush up the aisle. Within a week, 1,800 marriage licences were issued to same-sex couples, the vast majority of them women. Long-term lesbian unions tend to be even more monogamous and enduring than straight marriages. Men, it seems, gay or straight, are simply far less eager to commit. </p> <p>Already Jo had been to the gay marriages of many of her friends, hurried through on a wave of enthusiasm and the underlying worry that the decision could be reversed (as it has in California, where last month 4,000 same-sex marriages were annulled). Many of these were conveyor-belt weddings, so that guests witnessed not only their friends' marriage but several that came before as they waited for their friends' slot. Jo remembers watching two older gay men she had never met. The reverend announced that this was a special day for them, not only because they were getting married, but because it was their 33rd anniversary. \"Their 33rd,\" said Jo. \"They'd had to wait so very, very long.\" </p> <p>Jo, a lawyer and relentless organiser, was determined that her wedding would not be rushed but a properly planned event. There would be fresh flowers and live music and appropriate readings. Everything had to be perfect. She became a wedding bore. Did she really need to email me full details of who would be making which toasts and for how long, when I didn't know half the other guests anyway? Did Jo think that being gay made her agonising over where to hold the reception (the local arts association hall or a more expensive hotel), and what should be on the menu (mini pizzas or angels on horseback) any more interesting? </p> <p>On the day itself, the family gathering resembled the line-up at any wedding: there was Jo's 85-year-old father and her two-year-old niece, there were women in lilac and men in suits. Jo's lilac silk trouser suit might have worked just as well at a church wedding in Tunbridge Wells, although perhaps not on the bride. But the opening \"statements of appreciation\" by the betrotheds were determinedly different. </p> <p>\"I love you for agreeing to do things that wouldn't have been your first choice: tennis lessons, family bridge games, a large wedding,\" Jo began. (Chris, eight years older and far more cautious, would have gone for something more modest.) \"I love you for your drive to accomplish things in your life - and in mine,\" Chris responded. They are so unalike, and yet they have never attempted to change each other, as so many heterosexual couples do. \"I imagine growing old together, driving you crazy with my chatter,\" said Jo. Chris ended: \"I look forward to rocking on the porch in our old age, me still in my pyjamas, dreaming of companionable silence; you wearing running shoes, chattering about the plans for the day.\" </p> <p>Sam, beaming down on his two moms (he is taller than both of them), handed the rings to Rabbi Karen. As the marriage licence was signed, she announced: \"With the power invested in me by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, I now pronounce you finally, and at long last, legally married, bound together in body and soul.\" The glass was crushed beneath their feet, and we all cheered, \"Mazel tov!\" It was one of the few moments in theceremony that the couple hadn't written themselves. </p> <p>At the reception (Jo went for the cheaper local hall in the end), friends took turns reading out poems, recalling shared experiences, and belting out songs they had adapted for the day. To the tune of New York, New York, we all sang, \"Start spreading the news./The court gave its OK./ They ruled for full equality,/For Chris and Jo ... \" </p> <p>When Jo's older brother got married four years earlier, he had to shoulder all sorts of family obligations, and his father had insisted he invite all his work colleagues. Jo escaped all of this; everyone who was at her wedding was there because they wanted to be. And Jo and Chris were getting married simply because they both really, really wanted to - and had done for a very long time. </p> <p>Unlike the union of so many straight couples, gay marriages are not about the bonding of two clans. In fact, they are usually the very opposite. A gay marriage is often the last straw for a family that can't accept the homosexuality of one of its members. Two of Chris's brothers (one with his male partner) and one of her sisters came to the wedding, but her mother, a staunch Catholic, refused to attend. She missed a great wedding. </p> <p>Perhaps, as gay marriages inevitably become more common, this wonder will lessen, and they will deteriorate into formulaic, impersonal, duty-bound events, just like the sort we have all been to many times before. Lesbians will get married to their long-term lovers because it will please their mothers. Gay men will tie the knot because that is what men who have been living together for some time are expected to do. Of course, this can't happen until straight and gay relationships are regarded as equal. Then, ironically, beautiful weddings like my best friend's could be a casualty. Equality can make you dull. </p> <p>Already some guests at Jo's wedding were getting cynical. Kate and Lyn had married in May, as soon as they could, after 11 years together, driving an open-top limousine through downtown Boston with a \"Just Legally Married\" banner tied across the bonnet; Lyn proudly introduced Kate to me as \"my lovely wife\". \"We always thought of marriage as a conservative thing,\" confesses Kate. \"Now we're all clamouring for it.\" Lyn knows why - it is because they have become professional, middle-aged women. \"Feminists used to be really against marriage because it was all about property, and we didn't have any. Now we're all for it, because it's all about property, and we've got some,\" she says. It is estimated that, in America, some 1,400 constitutional rights are denied to non-married couples. (The situation is better in Britain, where the state provides a financial safety net.) In America, with privatised healthcare and few social benefits, the legal status of marriage becomes more important. Even so, neither Kate and Lyn's, nor Jo and Chris's, nor any other same-sex marriage is recognised outside the Massachusetts state borders. If Jo and Chris moved to Missouri, they would be single again. </p> <p>Gay marriage remains a central political issue in the US, and in the forthcoming presidential election. George Bush wants a change in the constitution, to keep \"the meaning of marriage from being changed for ever\". On August 17, to prevent prospective gay brides and grooms flocking across the border, a supreme court judge ruled that out-of-state couples were barred from marrying in Massachusetts. Since the initial Massachusetts ruling last November, more than 35 states have introduced legislation aimed at preserving the definition of marriage as only between a woman and a man. </p> <p>Jo knows that, however wonderful her wedding and strong her relationship, it is possible that her marriage may not last. Last February, Meg and Lauren, wedding guests from California, queued for three days outside San Francisco city hall to tie the knot, one of more than 4,000 same-sex couples who took advantage of a change in the Californian state law that lasted just a month. Meg told me how she felt a thrill every time she ticked the \"married\" box on surveys. But last month, after California's highest court nullified every one of those licences, Meg and Lauren's marriage was dissolved. That small gesture of ticking a box marked \"married\", which gave Meg such pleasure, has now been denied her. </p> <p>But here, for now, were Jo and Chris, just legally married, dancing at their wedding reception in the arts association hall. It was a night of disco anthems - I Am What I Am, We Are Family, Sisters Are Doing It For Themselves. </p> <p>Then came, \"It started with a kiss\", bellowing out as I danced and danced at my best friend's wonderful wedding. Thank goodness that, for a few, and for a while at least, it can now come to this. </p> <p><b>Two is a couple ... sometimes</b></p> <p> <b> In the US</b><br> </p> <p> <b>\u00b7</b> President George W Bush is seeking a constitutional amendment that would ban gay marriages across the US. John Kerry does not endorse gay marriage, but believes that decisions on such matters should be taken at state level. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Vermont was the first US state to introduce same-sex civil unions in 2000, giving gay couples some of the entitlements of married people. The first state to permit legal marriages was Massachusetts in May 2004. Gay marriages are currently illegal in 38 US states. </p> <p><b> In the UK</b><br> </p> <p> <b>\u00b7</b> The civil partnership bill, which is yet to be made law, would give gay couples similar rights and responsibilities to married couples once they register their partnership. The earliest the bill could become law is late 2004, becoming effective from late 2005. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Ken Livingstone pledged to establish the London Partnerships Register when he first ran for Mayor of London. Ian Burford and his partner, Alexander Cannell, were the first gay couple to sign the register in September 2001. Manchester, Brighton, Leeds and Swansea now run similar schemes. </p> <p><b> Elsewhere</b><br> </p> <p> <b>\u00b7</b> Gay marriages are recognised in Belgium (since 2003), the Netherlands (since 2001), and some Canadian provinces. There are plans to introduce full legal status to same-sex marriages in Sweden and Taiwan. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Nine EU member states and some regions of Australia recognise civil partnerships.</p>",
  "John Kerry last night accused George Bush of being \"unfit to lead\" America and of having shirked the call to defend his country in Vietnam. <p>Mr Kerry's accusations came hours after the president addressed the Republican national convention in New York.</p> <p>In a unprecedented political rebuttal, the Democratic presidential challenger told cheering supporters at a midnight rally in the swing state of Ohio: \"I'm not going to have my commitment to defend this country questioned by those who refused to serve when they could have and by those who have misled the nation into Iraq. Misleading our nation into war in Iraq makes you unfit to lead this country. </p> <p>\"Doing nothing while this nation loses millions of jobs makes you unfit to lead this country. Letting 45 million Americans go without healthcare makes you unfit to lead this country. Letting the Saudi royal family control our energy costs makes you unfit to lead this country.\" </p> <p>Mr Kerry's stump speech came after the president questioned his rival's commitment to defend America at the Republican convention in New York and accused him of voting against the money needed for \"bullets and fuel and vehicles and body armour\" for US troops in Afghanistan and Iraq.</p> <p>President Bush's attack, however, was measured compared with assaults on the senator from the vice-president, Dick Cheney, and Zell Miller, a rightwing Democratic senator, on Wednesday evening. Mr Cheney described Mr Kerry as a politician who had repeatedly \"made the wrong call on national security\" while Senator Miller likened him to a \"bowl of mush\".</p> <p>These attacks came after an organisation called Swift Boat Veterans for Truth broadcast a series of adverts questioning Mr Kerry's Vietnam war record. The attacks have left the Democratic campaign struggling to regain the political initiative.</p> <p>This battering appears to have persuaded Mr Kerry to be much more explicit in comparing his war record with that of President Bush, whose posting with the Texas National Air Guard was less dangerous. It has also made Democrats more determined to focus on the economy and jobs, issues on which Mr Kerry has a strong advantage in the opinion polls.</p> <p>In his speech, Mr Kerry accused the president and the Republicans of not talking about the \"real issues\", such as creating jobs, improving the economy, expanding access to healthcare and reducing petrol prices. </p> <p>\"They did everything except talk about that\" at their four-day convention, he said. \"We have had insults; we have had anger from Republicans, and I'll tell you why: because they can't come to you and talk to you about having created jobs, since they have lost them. They can't come to you and talk to you about creating healthcare, since 5 million Americans have lost it. </p> <p>\"Their own labour secretary talks about exporting jobs overseas,\" he added. \"They can't talk about their record because it is a record of failure. And so all they do is attack.\" Mr Kerry will follow his speech with a campaigning bus tour of the swing state of Ohio. Beginning in Dayton, it will take him east through Springfield and arrive in Steubenville on Saturday.</p> <p>President Bush won Ohio by just 3% in 2000, and the state is one of more than a dozen at the centre of the political battle. Mr Kerry's trip there will be his 14th this year, while President Bush has made nearly two dozen visits.</p>",
  "<p>Rupert Murdoch's US television channel Fox News is reaping the benefit of its notorious rightwing stance with a ratings boost during the Republican party convention.</p> <p>For the first time ever, more viewers watched the national convention on Fox than on rival US news channels ABC, CBS or NBC. </p> <p>After beating the broadcast networks for the first time on Tuesday, Fox News dominated the ratings on Wednesday evening between 10pm and 11pm, when the vice president, Dick Cheney, gave his acceptance speech criticising John Kerry as unsuitable to lead America at \"a defining moment\" in its history.</p> <p>And the channel's figures were larger than the CBS and ABC combined viewership.</p> <p>Fox News' 5.9 million viewers compared to 4.5 million who watched on NBC, 2.6million for CBS and ABC's 3.3million, according to Nielsen Media Research.</p> <p>The large viewing figures for Fox News shocked its rivals with Neal Shapiro, the president of NBC News saying: \"Any time you see a number of that magnitude you have to think about it.\"</p> <p>Fox News's ratings success comes soon after a controversial US documentary, Outfoxed: Rupert Murdoch's War on Journalism, which became a cult classic when it topped Amazon.com's best-selling DVD list.</p> <p>But the publicity about the film's claims of uncovering Fox News' Republican bias, looks to have attracted new Republican viewers.</p> <p>The film accuses Fox of hiding behind claims of objectivity with its \"We report, you decide\" and \"Fair and balanced\" mottos.</p> <p>Claims of biased news reporting at Fox mounted when the war in Iraq began. It was accused of having a pro-war agenda because of its gung-ho reports on the conflict.</p> <p>But recently various US media outfits have acknowledged they did not give enough weight to reports of scepticism about the war.</p> <p>The Washington Post, New York Times and New Republic all said they had underplayed scepticism of the White House's claims that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "Mr. Chairman, delegates, fellow citizens: I am honored by your support, and I accept your nomination for President of the United States. <p>When I said those words four years ago, none of us could have envisioned what these years would bring. In the heart of this great city, we saw tragedy arrive on a quiet morning. We saw the bravery of rescuers grow with danger. We learned of passengers on a doomed plane who died with a courage that frightened their killers. We have seen a shaken economy rise to its feet. And we have seen Americans in uniform storming mountain strongholds, and charging through sandstorms, and liberating millions, with acts of valor that would make the men of Normandy proud.</p> <p>Since 2001, Americans have been given hills to climb, and found the strength to climb them. Now, because we have made the hard journey, we can see the valley below. Now, because we have faced challenges with resolve, we have historic goals within our reach, and greatness in our future. We will build a safer world and a more hopeful America and nothing will hold us back.</p> <p>In the work we have done, and the work we will do, I am fortunate to have a superb Vice President. I have counted on Dick Cheney's calm and steady judgment in difficult days, and I am honored to have him at my side.</p> <p>I am grateful to share my walk in life with Laura Bush. Americans have come to see the goodness and kindness and strength I first saw 26 years ago, and we love our First Lady.</p> <p>I am a fortunate father of two spirited, intelligent, and lovely young women. I am blessed with a sister and brothers who are also my closest friends. And I will always be the proud and grateful son of George and Barbara Bush.</p> <p>My father served eight years at the side of another great American, Ronald Reagan. His spirit of optimism and goodwill and decency are in this hall, and in our hearts, and will always define our party.</p> <p>Two months from today, voters will make a choice based on the records we have built, the convictions we hold, and the vision that guides us forward. A presidential election is a contest for the future. Tonight I will tell you where I stand, what I believe, and where I will lead this country in the next four years.</p> <p>I believe every child can learn, and every school must teach, so we passed the most important federal education reform in history. Because we acted, children are making sustained progress in reading and math, America's schools are getting better, and nothing will hold us back.</p> <p>I believe we have a moral responsibility to honor America's seniors so I brought Republicans and Democrats together to strengthen Medicare. Now seniors are getting immediate help buying medicine. Soon every senior will be able to get prescription drug coverage, and nothing will hold us back.</p> <p>I believe in the energy and innovative spirit of America's workers, entrepreneurs, farmers, and ranchers so we unleashed that energy with the largest tax relief in a generation. Because we acted, our economy is growing again, and creating jobs, and nothing will hold us back.</p> <p>I believe the most solemn duty of the American president is to protect the American people. If America shows uncertainty and weakness in this decade, the world will drift toward tragedy. This will not happen on my watch.</p> <p>I am running for President with a clear and positive plan to build a safer world, and a more hopeful America. I am running with a compassionate conservative philosophy: that government should help people improve their lives, not try to run their lives. I believe this Nation wants steady, consistent, principled leadership and that is why, with your help, we will win this election.</p> <p>The story of America is the story of expanding liberty: an ever-widening circle, constantly growing to reach further and include more. Our Nation's founding commitment is still our deepest commitment: In our world, and here at home, we will extend the frontiers of freedom.</p> <p>The times in which we live and work are changing dramatically. The workers of our parents' generation typically had one job, one skill, one career often with one company that provided health care and a pension. And most of those workers were men. Today, workers change jobs, even careers, many times during their lives, and in one of the most dramatic shifts our society has seen, two-thirds of all Moms also work outside the home.</p> <p>This changed world can be a time of great opportunity for all Americans to earn a better living, support your family, and have a rewarding career. And government must take your side. Many of our most fundamental systems - the tax code, health coverage, pension plans, worker training - were created for the world of yesterday, not tomorrow. We will transform these systems so that all citizens are equipped, prepared and thus truly free to make your own choices and pursue your own dreams.</p> <p>My plan begins with providing the security and opportunity of a growing economy. We now compete in a global market that provides new buyers for our goods, but new competition for our workers. To create more jobs in America, America must be the best place in the world to do business. To create jobs, my plan will encourage investment and expansion by restraining federal spending, reducing regulation, and making tax relief permanent. To create jobs, we will make our country less dependent on foreign sources of energy. To create jobs, we will expand trade and level the playing field to sell American goods and services across the globe. And we must protect small business owners and workers from the explosion of frivolous lawsuits that threaten jobs across America.</p> <p>Another drag on our economy is the current tax code, which is a complicated mess filled with special interest loopholes, saddling our people with more than six billion hours of paperwork and headache every year. The American people deserve and our economic future demands a simpler, fairer, pro-growth system. In a new term, I will lead a bipartisan effort to reform and simplify the federal tax code.</p> <p>Another priority in a new term will be to help workers take advantage of the expanding economy to find better, higher-paying jobs. In this time of change, many workers want to go back to school to learn different or higher-level skills. So we will double the number of people served by our principal job training program and increase funding for community colleges. I know that with the right skills, American workers can compete with anyone, anywhere in the world.</p> <p>In this time of change, opportunity in some communities is more distant than in others. To stand with workers in poor communities and those that have lost manufacturing, textile, and other jobs we will create American opportunity zones. In these areas, we'll provide tax relief and other incentives to attract new business, and improve housing and job training to bring hope and work throughout all of America.</p> <p>As I've traveled the country, I've met many workers and small business owners who have told me they are worried they cannot afford health care. More than half of the uninsured are small-business employees and their families. In a new term, we must allow small firms to join together to purchase insurance at the discounts available to big companies. We will offer a tax credit to encourage small businesses and their employees to set up health savings accounts, and provide direct help for low-income Americans to purchase them. These accounts give workers the security of insurance against major illness, the opportunity to save tax-free for routine health expenses, and the freedom of knowing you can take your account with you whenever you change jobs. And we will provide low-income Americans with better access to health care: In a new term, I will ensure every poor county in America has a community or rural health center.</p> <p>As I have traveled our country, I have met too many good doctors, especially OB-GYNS, who are being forced out of practice because of the high cost of lawsuits. To make health care more affordable and accessible, we must pass medical liability reform now. And in all we do to improve health care in America, we will make sure that health decisions are made by doctors and patients, not by bureaucrats in Washington, DC.</p> <p>In this time of change, government must take the side of working families. In a new term, we will change outdated labor laws to offer comp-time and flex-time. Our laws should never stand in the way of a more family-friendly workplace.</p> <p>Another priority for a new term is to build an ownership society, because ownership brings security, and dignity, and independence.</p> <p>Thanks to our policies, homeownership in America is at an all-time high. Tonight we set a new goal: seven million more affordable homes in the next 10 years so more American families will be able to open the door and say welcome to my home.</p> <p>In an ownership society, more people will own their health plans, and have the confidence of owning a piece of their retirement. We will always keep the promise of Social Security for our older workers. With the huge Baby Boom generation approaching retirement, many of our children and grandchildren understandably worry whether Social Security will be there when they need it. We must strengthen Social Security by allowing younger workers to save some of their taxes in a personal account - a nest egg you can call your own, and government can never take away.</p> <p>In all these proposals, we seek to provide not just a government program, but a path to greater opportunity, more freedom, and more control over your own life.</p> <p>This path begins with our youngest Americans. To build a more hopeful America, we must help our children reach as far as their vision and character can take them. Tonight, I remind every parent and every teacher, I say to every child: No matter what your circumstance, no matter where you live, your school will be the path to the promise of America.</p> <p>We are transforming our schools by raising standards and focusing on results. We are insisting on accountability, empowering parents and teachers, and making sure that local people are in charge of their schools. By testing every child, we are identifying those who need help and we're providing a record level of funding to get them that help. In northeast Georgia, Gainesville Elementary School is mostly Hispanic and 90 percent poor and this year 90 percent of its students passed state tests in reading and math. The principal expresses the philosophy of his school this way: \"We don't focus on what we can't do at this school; we focus on what we can do; we do whatever it takes to get kids across the finish line.\" This principal is challenging the soft bigotry of low expectations, and that is the spirit of our education reform, and the commitment of our country: No dejaremos a ningun ni\u00f1o atras. We will leave no child behind.</p> <p>We are making progress and there is more to do. In this time of change, most new jobs are filled by people with at least two years of college, yet only about one in four students gets there. In our high schools, we will fund early intervention programs to help students at risk. We will place a new focus on math and science. As we make progress, we will require a rigorous exam before graduation. By raising performance in our high schools, and expanding Pell grants for low and middle income families, we will help more Americans start their career with a college diploma.</p> <p>America's children must also have a healthy start in life. In a new term, we will lead an aggressive effort to enroll millions of poor children who are eligible but not signed up for the government's health insurance programs. We will not allow a lack of attention, or information, to stand between these children and the health care they need.</p> <p>Anyone who wants more details on my agenda can find them online. The web address is not very imaginative, but it's easy to remember: GeorgeWBush.com.</p> <p>These changing times can be exciting times of expanded opportunity. And here, you face a choice. My opponent's policies are dramatically different from ours. Senator Kerry opposed Medicare reform and health savings accounts. After supporting my education reforms, he now wants to dilute them. He opposes legal and medical liability reform. He opposed reducing the marriage penalty, opposed doubling the child credit, and opposed lowering income taxes for all who pay them. To be fair, there are some things my opponent is for: he's proposed more than two trillion dollars in new federal spending so far, and that's a lot, even for a senator from Massachusetts. To pay for that spending, he is running on a platform of increasing taxes, and that's the kind of promise a politician usually keeps.</p> <p>His policies of tax and spend - of expanding government rather than expanding opportunity - are the policies of the past. We are on the path to the future and we are not turning back.</p> <p>In this world of change, some things do not change: the values we try to live by, the institutions that give our lives meaning and purpose. Our society rests on a foundation of responsibility and character and family commitment.</p> <p>Because family and work are sources of stability and dignity, I support welfare reform that strengthens family and requires work. Because a caring society will value its weakest members, we must make a place for the unborn child. Because religious charities provide a safety net of mercy and compassion, our government must never discriminate against them. Because the union of a man and woman deserves an honored place in our society, I support the protection of marriage against activist judges. And I will continue to appoint federal judges who know the difference between personal opinion and the strict interpretation of the law.</p> <p>My opponent recently announced that he is the candidate of \"conservative values,\" which must have come as a surprise to a lot of his supporters. Now, there are some problems with this claim. If you say the heart and soul of America is found in Hollywood, I'm afraid you are not the candidate of conservative values. If you voted against the bipartisan Defense of Marriage Act, which President Clinton signed, you are not the candidate of conservative values. If you gave a speech, as my opponent did, calling the Reagan presidency eight years of \"moral darkness,\" then you may be a lot of things, but the candidate of conservative values is not one of them.</p> <p>This election will also determine how America responds to the continuing danger of terrorism and you know where I stand. Three days after September 11th, I stood where Americans died, in the ruins of the Twin Towers. Workers in hard hats were shouting to me, \"Whatever it takes.\" A fellow grabbed me by the arm and he said, \"Do not let me down.\" Since that day, I wake up every morning thinking about how to better protect our country. I will never relent in defending America whatever it takes.</p> <p>So we have fought the terrorists across the earth not for pride, not for power, but because the lives of our citizens are at stake. Our strategy is clear. We have tripled funding for homeland security and trained half a million first responders, because we are determined to protect our homeland. We are transforming our military and reforming and strengthening our intelligence services. We are staying on the offensive striking terrorists abroad so we do not have to face them here at home. And we are working to advance liberty in the broader Middle East, because freedom will bring a future of hope, and the peace we all want. And we will prevail.</p> <p>Our strategy is succeeding. Four years ago, Afghanistan was the home base of al-Qaida, Pakistan was a transit point for terrorist groups, Saudi Arabia was fertile ground for terrorist fundraising, Libya was secretly pursuing nuclear weapons, Iraq was a gathering threat, and al-Qaida was largely unchallenged as it planned attacks. Today, the government of a free Afghanistan is fighting terror, Pakistan is capturing terrorist leaders, Saudi Arabia is making raids and arrests, Libya is dismantling its weapons programs, the army of a free Iraq is fighting for freedom, and more than three-quarters of al-Qaida's key members and associates have been detained or killed. We have led, many have joined, and America and the world are safer.</p> <p>This progress involved careful diplomacy, clear moral purpose, and some tough decisions. And the toughest came on Iraq. We knew Saddam Hussein's record of aggression and support for terror. We knew his long history of pursuing, even using, weapons of mass destruction. And we know that September 11th requires our country to think differently: We must, and we will, confront threats to America before it is too late.</p> <p>In Saddam Hussein, we saw a threat. Members of both political parties, including my opponent and his running mate, saw the threat, and voted to authorize the use of force. We went to the United Nations Security Council, which passed a unanimous resolution demanding the dictator disarm, or face serious consequences. Leaders in the Middle East urged him to comply. After more than a decade of diplomacy, we gave Saddam Hussein another chance, a final chance, to meet his responsibilities to the civilized world. He again refused, and I faced the kind of decision that comes only to the Oval Office - a decision no president would ask for, but must be prepared to make. Do I forget the lessons of September 11th and take the word of a madman, or do I take action to defend our country? Faced with that choice, I will defend America every time.</p> <p>Because we acted to defend our country, the murderous regimes of Saddam Hussein and the Taliban are history, more than 50 million people have been liberated, and democracy is coming to the broader Middle East. In Afghanistan, terrorists have done everything they can to intimidate people yet more than 10 million citizens have registered to vote in the October presidential election - a resounding endorsement of democracy. Despite ongoing acts of violence, Iraq now has a strong Prime Minister, a national council, and national elections are scheduled for January. Our Nation is standing with the people of Afghanistan and Iraq, because when America gives its word, America must keep its word. As importantly, we are serving a vital and historic cause that will make our country safer. Free societies in the Middle East will be hopeful societies, which no longer feed resentments and breed violence for export. Free governments in the Middle East will fight terrorists instead of harboring them, and that helps us keep the peace. So our mission in Afghanistan and Iraq is clear: We will help new leaders to train their armies, and move toward elections, and get on the path of stability and democracy as quickly as possible. And then our troops will return home with the honor they have earned.</p> <p>Our troops know the historic importance of our work. One Army Specialist wrote home: \"We are transforming a once sick society into a hopeful place The various terrorist enemies we are facing in Iraq,\" he continued, \"are really aiming at you back in the United States. This is a test of will for our country. We soldiers of yours are doing great and scoring victories in confronting the evil terrorists.\"</p> <p>That young man is right - our men and women in uniform are doing a superb job for America. Tonight I want to speak to all of them and to their families: You are involved in a struggle of historic proportion. Because of your service and sacrifice, we are defeating the terrorists where they live and plan, and making America safer. Because of you, women in Afghanistan are no longer shot in a sports stadium. Because of you, the people of Iraq no longer fear being executed and left in mass graves. Because of you, the world is more just and will be more peaceful. We owe you our thanks, and we owe you something more. We will give you all the resources, all the tools, and all the support you need for victory.</p> <p>Again, my opponent and I have different approaches. I proposed, and the Congress overwhelmingly passed, 87 billion dollars in funding needed by our troops doing battle in Afghanistan and Iraq. My opponent and his running mate voted against this money for bullets, and fuel, and vehicles, and body armor. When asked to explain his vote, the Senator said, \"I actually did vote for the 87 billion dollars before I voted against it.\" Then he said he was \"proud\" of that vote. Then, when pressed, he said it was a \"complicated\" matter. There is nothing complicated about supporting our troops in combat.</p> <p>Our allies also know the historic importance of our work. About 40 nations stand beside us in Afghanistan, and some 30 in Iraq. And I deeply appreciate the courage and wise counsel of leaders like Prime Minister Howard, and President Kwasniewski, and Prime Minister Berlusconi and, of course, Prime Minister Tony Blair.</p> <p>Again, my opponent takes a different approach. In the midst of war, he has called America's allies, quote, a \"coalition of the coerced and the bribed.\" That would be nations like Great Britain, Poland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Denmark, El Salvador, Australia, and others allies that deserve the respect of all Americans, not the scorn of a politician. I respect every soldier, from every country, who serves beside us in the hard work of history. America is grateful, and America will not forget.</p> <p>The people we have freed won't forget either. Not long ago, seven Iraqi men came to see me in the Oval Office. They had \"X\"s branded into their foreheads, and their right hands had been cut off, by Saddam Hussein's secret police, the sadistic punishment for imaginary crimes. During our emotional visit one of the Iraqi men used his new prosthetic hand to slowly write out, in Arabic, a prayer for God to bless America. I am proud that our country remains the hope of the oppressed, and the greatest force for good on this earth.</p> <p>Others understand the historic importance of our work. The terrorists know. They know that a vibrant, successful democracy at the heart of the Middle East will discredit their radical ideology of hate. They know that men and women with hope, and purpose, and dignity do not strap bombs on their bodies and kill the innocent. The terrorists are fighting freedom with all their cunning and cruelty because freedom is their greatest fear and they should be afraid, because freedom is on the march.</p> <p>I believe in the transformational power of liberty: The wisest use of American strength is to advance freedom. As the citizens of Afghanistan and Iraq seize the moment, their example will send a message of hope throughout a vital region. Palestinians will hear the message that democracy and reform are within their reach, and so is peace with our good friend Israel. Young women across the Middle East will hear the message that their day of equality and justice is coming. Young men will hear the message that national progress and dignity are found in liberty, not tyranny and terror. Reformers, and political prisoners, and exiles will hear the message that their dream of freedom cannot be denied forever. And as freedom advances heart by heart, and nation by nation, America will be more secure and the world more peaceful.</p> <p>America has done this kind of work before and there have always been doubters. In 1946, 18 months after the fall of Berlin to allied forces, a journalist wrote in the New York Times, \"Germany is a land in an acute stage of economic, political and moral crisis. [European] capitals are frightened. In every [military] headquarters, one meets alarmed officials doing their utmost to deal with the consequences of the occupation policy that they admit has failed.\" End quote. Maybe that same person's still around, writing editorials. Fortunately, we had a resolute president named Truman, who with the American people persevered, knowing that a new democracy at the center of Europe would lead to stability and peace. And because that generation of Americans held firm in the cause of liberty, we live in a better and safer world today.</p> <p>The progress we and our friends and allies seek in the broader Middle East will not come easily, or all at once. Yet Americans, of all people, should never be surprised by the power of liberty to transform lives and nations. That power brought settlers on perilous journeys, inspired colonies to rebellion, ended the sin of slavery, and set our Nation against the tyrannies of the 20th century. We were honored to aid the rise of democracy in Germany and Japan and Nicaragua and Central Europe and the Baltics and that noble story goes on. I believe that America is called to lead the cause of freedom in a new century. I believe that millions in the Middle East plead in silence for their liberty. I believe that given the chance, they will embrace the most honorable form of government ever devised by man. I believe all these things because freedom is not America's gift to the world, it is the Almighty God's gift to every man and woman in this world.</p> <p>This moment in the life of our country will be remembered. Generations will know if we kept our faith and kept our word. Generations will know if we seized this moment, and used it to build a future of safety and peace. The freedom of many, and the future security of our Nation, now depend on us. And tonight, my fellow Americans, I ask you to stand with me.</p> <p>In the last four years, you and I have come to know each other. Even when we don't agree, at least you know what I believe and where I stand. You may have noticed I have a few flaws, too. People sometimes have to correct my English. I knew I had a problem when Arnold Schwarzenegger started doing it. Some folks look at me and see a certain swagger, which in Texas is called \"walking.\" Now and then I come across as a little too blunt and for that we can all thank the white-haired lady sitting right up there.</p> <p>One thing I have learned about the presidency is that, whatever shortcomings you have, people are going to notice them and whatever strengths you have, you're going to need them. These four years have brought moments I could not foresee and will not forget. I have tried to comfort Americans who lost the most on September 11th - people who showed me a picture or told me a story, so I would know how much was taken from them. I have learned first-hand that ordering Americans into battle is the hardest decision, even when it is right. I have returned the salute of wounded soldiers, some with a very tough road ahead, who say they were just doing their job. I've held the children of the fallen, who are told their dad or mom is a hero, but would rather just have their dad or mom.</p> <p>And I have met with parents and wives and husbands who have received a folded flag, and said a final goodbye to a soldier they loved. I am awed that so many have used those meetings to say that I am in their prayers to offer encouragement to me. Where does strength like that come from? How can people so burdened with sorrow also feel such pride? It is because they know their loved one was last seen doing good. Because they know that liberty was precious to the one they lost. And in those military families, I have seen the character of a great nation: decent, and idealistic, and strong.</p> <p>The world saw that spirit three miles from here, when the people of this city faced peril together, and lifted a flag over the ruins, and defied the enemy with their courage. My fellow Americans, for as long as our country stands, people will look to the resurrection of New York City and they will say: Here buildings fell, and here a nation rose.</p> <p>We see America's character in our military, which finds a way or makes one. We see it in our veterans, who are supporting military families in their days of worry. We see it in our young people, who have found heroes once again. We see that character in workers and entrepreneurs, who are renewing our economy with their effort and optimism. And all of this has confirmed one belief beyond doubt: Having come this far, our tested and confident Nation can achieve anything.</p> <p>To everything we know there is a season - a time for sadness, a time for struggle, a time for rebuilding. And now we have reached a time for hope. This young century will be liberty's century. By promoting liberty abroad, we will build a safer world. By encouraging liberty at home, we will build a more hopeful America. Like generations before us, we have a calling from beyond the stars to stand for freedom. This is the everlasting dream of America and tonight, in this place, that dream is renewed. Now we go forward grateful for our freedom, faithful to our cause, and confident in the future of the greatest nation on earth.</p> <p>God bless you, and may God continue to bless America.</p>",
  "Welcome to the Wrap, Guardian Unlimited's round-up of the best of the day's papers. <p><b>BREAKING NEWS</b>: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uselections2004/story/0,13918,1296602,00.html\">George Bush last night laid out his case for another term in the White House, claiming only he would keep America safe from a \"drift towards tragedy\" in a world scarred by terrorism</a>.</p> <p><b>SCHOOL SIEGE WEARS ON</b></p> <p>All the papers lead with a picture of a burly Russian special forces officer carrying a young baby to safety from the North Ossetia school where terrorists are holding hundreds of children and adults hostage.</p> <p>The terrorists released 31 women and young children yesterday, but despite the siege entering its third day, they have still refused to accept food and water for the captives. The children have been drinking tap and toilet water, but food had run out, the Telegraph reported. </p> <p>Russian officials say that about 320 hostages remain inside, but the Guardian cites a woman released yesterday who claimed the true figure was 1,020. </p> <p>Anguished relatives fear Russian forces will launch an assault on the school. </p> <p>The Guardian fears that the pro-Russian, Christian Orthodox, well-armed region of North Ossetia will exact its own revenge on its Muslim neighbours in Ingushetia and Chechnya without waiting for Moscow. \"The delicate patchwork of multi-ethnic statelets on Russia's sensitive southern flank could rapidly unravel,\" a leader says. </p> <p>The Times contrasts the horror unfolding in the Russian town of Beslan with the high hopes in France that two journalists held in Iraq will be set free today. Early reports indicated that they may have been handed over to a Sunni opposition group, despite France's refusal to capitulate to the demand that it reverse a law banning headscarves (and other religious symbols) in schools. </p> <p>French Muslims, however, proved themselves unwilling to be dictated to by foreign terrorists, and backed the government even while they disagreed with the headscarf ban. \"The kidnappers had unwittingly succeeded in forging an unprecedented sense of national solidarity in France,\" the Times quotes the French education minister as saying. </p> <p>Several of the papers feature a photograph of a French Muslim schoolgirl experimenting with a wig in place of a headscarf. She looks distinctly uncomfortable with the compromise. </p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/russia/article/0,2763,1296517,00.html\">Amid the savagery of the siege, an act of humanity</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/russia/article/0,2763,1296289,00.html\">A terrible lesson from a classroom in Beslan</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/09/03/wosse103.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2004/09/03/ixnewstop.html\">Telegraph: Distressed parents can only hope</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,7374-1244339,00.html\">Times: Journalists held in Iraq to be set free</a></p> <p><b>BUSH: PRE-EMPTIVE STRIKES WILL CONTINUE</b></p> <p>Do you remember compassionate conservatism? Well, it's back, and now it has a global agenda. </p> <p>The US, apparently, is going to become \"liberty central\". Thus spake George Bush just before delivering his speech yesterday to the Republican national convention. He went on to tell the assembled minions in New York that he would continue to pursue the \"Bush doctrine\" of striking pre-emptively at enemies before they could strike the US. </p> <p>\"I am running for president with a clear and positive plan to build a safer world, and a more hopeful America. I am running with a compassionate conservative philosophy: that the government should help people improve their lives, not try to run their lives,\" he said. The Wrap hopes for the sake of all those foreigners about to be affected that the international flavour of compassionate conservatism includes job creation, health care and the eradication of poverty, items noticeably absent from the domestic agenda.</p> <p>The Independent pretty much ignores Bush's speech, instead devoting five pages, including the front, to a list of numbers compiled by Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter. It's designed to prove (cuz numbers are scientific, see?) that Mr Bush has been a horrid failure as president. If you can be bothered to read this interminable list (\"46: percentage increase in sales between 2001 and 2002 of GI Joe figures\"), you will stumble across some gems. (USD10.6m: average wealth of the members of Bush's original 16-person cabinet.) </p> <p>Meanwhile the Telegraph reports that the \"mother of the hanging chad\" - the Palm Beach Country, Florida, election official responsible for selecting the disastrous punchcard ballot for the 2000 presidential election - has been voted out of office. Theresa LePore will, however, still preside over the November election. Surely if they just fling a load of ballots at Hurricane Frances, the result will be every bit as accurate a reflection of the voters' will. </p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uselections2004/story/0,13918,1296500,00.html\">Bush: war on terror will not cease</a><br> * <a href=\"http://news.independent.co.uk/world/americas/story.jsp?story=557746\">Independent: Bush by numbers: Four years of double standards</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/09/03/wus303.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2004/09/03/ixnewstop.html\">Telegraph: Mother of the hanging chad deposed</a></p> <p><b>WANT FRIES WITH THAT?</b></p> <p>For all those tired of hearing about how flabby Britain has become, the Sun has discovered a kebab shop in Glasgow that produces the antidote: the Stonner Kebab.

  "George Bush last night laid out his case for another term in the White House, claiming only he would keep America safe from a \"drift towards tragedy\" in a world scarred by terrorism. <p>Half of his hour-long speech at Madison Square Garden in acceptance of his party's nomination to run again for office was devoted to defending his domestic record and promising a modernised tax and welfare system. </p> <p>But the biggest cheers from delegates, as well as tears, came as he outlined his vision for America abroad.</p> <p>\"I believe the most solemn duty of the American president is to protect the American people. If America shows uncertainty and weakness in this decade the world will drift towards tragedy. This will not happen on my watch,\" he said. </p> <p>\"I am running for president with a clear and positive plan to build a safer world and a more hopeful America.\"</p> <p>In keeping with the themes of the week, he played heavily on his personal involvement with the victims of the September 11 attacks and described their profound impact on his strength and resolve.</p> <p>\"Since that day I wake up every morning thinking about how to better protect our country. I will never relent in defending America, whatever it takes.\" </p> <p>While he outlined specific initiatives for domestic policy, such as a simplified federal tax code and the construction of 7m more homes over the next 10 years, his foreign policy agenda was heavy on rhetoric and decidedly light on detail. </p> <p>In Iraq and Afghanistan \"our strategy is succeeding\", he said, adding that America needed to play a central role in overseeing the democratisation of the entire region.</p> <p>\"Free societies in the Middle East will be hopeful societies, which no longer feed resentments and breed violence for export ... I am proud that our country remains the hope of the oppressed and the greatest force for good on this Earth.\" </p> <p>Despite repeatedly praising the efforts and sacrifice of America's armed forces, he gave no indication as to how or when they might begin the journey home. </p> <p>His attacks on his Democratic opponent were measured, compared with the full-frontal assault by his vice-president, Dick Cheney, the night before. </p> <p>He drove home the Republicans' portrayal of John Kerry as a pandering, indecisive liberal who insulted America's allies in the war on terror by referring to them in the context of Iraq as a \"coalition of the coerced and the bribed\".</p> <p>At a midnight rally in his home state of Massachusetts, Senator Kerry responded to the president's speech in unprecedented style, comparing his own Vietnam war record with his rival's less dangerous posting with the Texas Air National Guard. </p> <p>\"They have attacked my patriotism and my fitness to serve as commander in chief,\" he told the cheering crowd. \"I'm not going to have my commitment to defend this country questioned by those who refused to serve when they could have and by those who have misled the nation into Iraq.\" </p> <p>President Bush did, however, have something good to say about one centre-left politician: mention of Tony Blair's support brought a warm round of applause from the crowd.</p> <p>Delegates were distracted twice again last night by outbursts from individual protesters during the speech. Dozens of extra secret service and security staff were on hand to eject the two female agitators while delegates drowned out their cries with chants of \"Four more years\".</p> <p>Osama bin Laden, who remains at large, did not merit a mention, but George Bush had no such qualms about again seeking to justify his decision to invade Iraq and topple Saddam Hussein.</p> <p>\"Do I forget the lessons of September 11 and take the word of a madman or do I take action to defend our country?\" he asked. \"Faced with that choice, I will defend America every time.\"</p> <p>With the Israeli-Palestinian \"road map\" for peace long abandoned by his administration, Mr Bush expressed an optimistic belief that the democratic potential of a new Afghanistan and Iraq would soon rub off: \"Palestinians will hear the message that democracy and reform are within their reach and so is peace with our good friend Israel,\" he said.</p> <p>The president, who has spent months attending to the party's rightwing base, last night portrayed himself as the custodian of a \"compassionate conservative philosophy\" as well as the defender of religious-based ideology. </p> <p>To huge cheers from the large numbers of delegates who campaign against abortion and regard their stance as an essential part of the Republican platform, he said that in a \"caring society ... we must make a place for the unborn child.\" </p> <p>On the contentious but equally emotive issue of gay marriage he had another chunk of red meat to throw from his purpose-built, circular stage in the centre of the auditorium. \"I support the protection of marriage against activist judges,\" he said, tapping into the rage that many in the hall feel towards the Massachusetts supreme court, which legalised same-sex marriage earlier this year. </p> <p>As his speech neared its close, the president made a rare foray into self-examination: \"Even when we don't agree, at least you know what I believe and where I stand,\" he said. \"You may have noticed I have a few flaws, too: people sometimes have to correct my English. I knew I had a problem when Arnold Schwarzenegger started doing it.\"</p> <p>\"Now and then I come across as a little too blunt, and for that we can all thank the white-haired lady sitting right up there,\" he added, pointing towards his mother, Barbara. </p> <p>As he outlined his record in office there was no talk of the 1.1m job losses that Democrats still hope might undermine the obvious authority being a war president bestows. Mr Bush instead painted a selective picture of a rosy economy that has turned the corner. </p> <p>To distract from the continuing grim statistics on jobs he threw in initiatives to provide new health centres for every \"poor\" county in the land, though there was no indication of how this would be paid for in a time of federal spending cuts.</p> <p>He also outlined populist measures to curtail huge cash settlements against doctors in malpractice suits, which drive up insurance premiums.</p> <p>But to bring the Republicans' seamlessly produced convention narrative to a close, he returned once again to his main argument: America will only heal with four more years of nurturing from Mr Bush. </p> <p>\"To everything we know, there is a season - a time for sadness, a time for struggle, a time for rebuilding. And now we have reached a time for hope. This young century will be liberty's century.\"</p> <p>The president was clearly nervous beneath the surface, even fluffing his final line before the deafening roar of approval released the first of the traditional end-of-convention balloons. </p> <p>His manner was strangely introspective, hinting perhaps at a new confidence that the election is now his to lose.</p> <p>Delegates filed out into the Manhattan night relieved that their sojourn in the Democratic citadel was over. </p> <p>Looking at the exhausted faces of policemen, security officers and even the odd protester left behind on the subway system, you could tell the feeling was mutual. </p> <p>Whether the Bush mission to demolish the credibility of his Democrat rival has been accomplished will only become clear in the tough weeks of swing state campaigning that lie ahead.</p>",
  "<p>In an election where image is everything, George Bush may have a bit of brand polishing yet to do with a new survey showing voters associate him with the downmarket Dunkin' Donuts while they think John Kerry is a smooth Starbucks man.</p> <p>The study found that Mr Bush is associated with mainstay brands such as IBM, Ford and Bud Light beer, while Kerry is aligned with premium, high-performance brands such as Heineken, Apple and BMW.</p> <p>Among his supporters, Mr Bush was associated with positive attributes of established brands such as IBM and Ford - reliability, solidity and heritage.</p> <p>Mr Kerry's supporters associated him with the brand attributes of Apple and BMW - high-quality, high-performance and hip.</p> <p>But the politicians' detractors associated Mr Bush with brands they thought were outdated, such as McDonald's and Dunkin' Donuts. Mr Kerry was seen as expensive, like Starbucks, elite, like BMW, and lacking substance, like Motel 6, the hotel chain.</p> <p>\"John Kerry attracted strong brands but more niche brands, whereas Bush attracted more mainstream, established brands,\" said Allen Adamson, the New York managing director of Landor Associates, the branding company that published the survey.</p> <p>This mirrored their roles of a challenger taking on an incumbent, he said.</p> <p>Mr Kerry had an advantage with the critical floating voters because the brands they associated with the Democratic challenger were reaching the height of their popularity, such as Starbucks, while the brands they associated with Mr Bush had to guard against being seen as outdated and irrelevant, such as IBM.</p> <p>Asking people about the brands they linked with people was often a path to their real thoughts, Mr Adamson said.</p> <p>Voters often did not want to admit what they thought of who they supported in focus groups. </p> <p>\"Sometimes they are able to communicate what they are really feeling with such brand games,\" he said. \"Because they use brands to define themselves they are comfortable using brands to define others.</p> <p>\"When people are anxious or stressed they tend to go back to the brands they are very comfortable with. When they are more relaxed they tend to go for new brands,\" Mr Adamson added.</p> <p>Landor Associates and research firm Penn, Schoen and Berland contacted a representative sample of 1,262 registered voters via the internet for their Presidental ImagePower survey.</p> <p>Voters compared Mr Bush and Mr Kerry with brands in several different categories, including coffee outlets, magazines, hotels, beer and cars.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email <a href=\"mailto:editor@mediatheguardian.com\">editor@mediatheguardian.com</a> or phone 020 7239 9857</p> <p><strong><strong>\u00b7</strong></strong> If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\".</p>",
  "Campaigning for England's first regional devolution referendum began yesterday with a glitzy launch in Durham city and an opinion poll showing relatively strong support for an elected assembly in the north-east. <p>But rolling out a string of supporting personalities, from the former Olympic athlete and commentator Brendan Foster, to the president of Newcastle United, Sir John Hall, the group Yes 4 the North East acknowledged that many electors were unsure of their views two months before the all-postal ballot. </p> <p>Yesterday's ICM poll for the group, among 1,000 electors in the north-east, found that while 48% would back an assembly - one broadly similar to the Greater London Authority - 27% were against it. But the 25% undecided will determine the outcome of the November 4 referendum. </p> <p>Guests packed into Durham's town hall, which could provide the home for a 25-member assembly, to the sound of the Manchester band M People reinforcing the slogan \"Vote for the North East - be proud, be positive\". </p> <p>Mr Foster told the audience that the north-east needed a strong voice to counter the centralist tendencies of the government and the growing strength of London and the south-east. \"There is no strategy for the region,\" he said. \"I am sure the north-east wants to control its own destiny. This is make or break, a once in a lifetime opportunity.\" </p> <p>In July, the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, who has campaigned for England's devolution, postponed the plans for referendums in the north-west and Yorkshire. This came after pressure from Downing Street following a rebellion by backbench Labour MPs who claimed referendums would be a damaging distraction for the government seven months before a likely general election. But the north-east, less marginal than the other regions, was considered to be a safer bet. </p> <p>Today marks the deadline for organisations, such as Yes 4 the North East, to apply to the Electoral Commission for designation as official campaign groups, each eligible for \u00a3100,000 of public funds. While only one yes campaign has emerged, the commission needs to decide between two no campaigns. One is led by the Sunderland \"metric martyr\" Neil Herron, and the other is funded largely by the old north-east establishment and veteran businessmen, including the former transport magnate Sir Tom Cowie. </p> <p>The commission will make a final decision around September 14 when groups will be reminded that spending will be capped at \u00a3665,000 - if they can raise that much cash - including the \u00a3100,000 public grant. </p> <p>In addition, political parties will face spending caps based on their share of the vote in the last local elections in the north-east. Labour and the Liberal Democrats, which will both campaign for a yes vote, will be allowed to spend no more than \u00a3665,000 and \u00a3400,000 respectively, while the Tories and the UK Independence party, in the no camp, will be capped at \u00a3400,000 each. </p> <p>To further complicate the process, individuals too can register with the commission and will be able to spend up to \u00a3100,000 each. This has raised fears among commission officials that wealthy individuals will be able to exploit the process by spreading money around sympathisers while remaining anonymous.</p>",
  "President Bush yesterday vowed that if re-elected he would \"stay on the offensive against terrorism\" and extend the frontiers of freedom, pledging that \"nothing will hold us back\". <p>In his address to the Republican faithful in New York, he made it clear that he intends to pursue the \"Bush Doctrine\" in his second term, striking enemies pre-emptively before they threaten the US. </p> <p>\"We are staying on the offensive - striking terrorists abroad - so we do not have to face them here at home,\" Mr Bush said, according to a text of his speech released before delivery. \"We must, and we will, confront threats to America before it is too late.\" </p> <p>In the speech, made from a round podium at the heart of Madison Square Garden, the president also made it clear that he intended to continue his administration's stated mission to spread democracy in the Middle East and beyond. \"In our world, and here at home, we will extend the frontiers of freedom,\" he said. </p> <p>\"I am proud that our country remains the hope of the oppressed, and the greatest force for good on this Earth ... And as freedom advances, heart by heart, and nation by nation, America will be more secure and the world more peaceful.\" </p> <p>The president pledged: \"We will build a safer world and a more hopeful America, and nothing will hold us back.\" </p> <p>\"Nothing will hold us back\" was a recurring note of the speech. </p> <p>Addressing criticisms that his administration dealt with large-scale unemployment by making tax cuts that disproportionately favoured the wealthy, Mr Bush revived a slogan he used in the 2000 election, claiming the mantle of \"compassionate conservative\". </p> <p>\"I am running for president with a clear and positive plan to build a safer world, and a more hopeful America. I am running with a compassionate conservative philosophy: that government should help people improve their lives, not try to run their lives,\" he said. </p> <p>In some detail, he promised to transform government pensions, by allowing workers to set up individual accounts, simplify the tax code, offer tax breaks for private health insurance and promote preventative health clinics in poor areas. </p> <p>Democrats dismissed the promised return of \"compassionate conservatism\". Mary Beth Cahill, John Kerry's campaign manager, described the domestic proposals as \"a warmed over repetition of promises he made in 2000 and has broken\". </p> <p>In a wide-ranging interview before his convention address, the president made no apologies for the invasion of Iraq, and presented it as part of a more general policy of promoting freedom. </p> <p>\"Overseas, I'm going to be talking about peace,\" he told the Columbus Dispatch, a major newspaper in Ohio where Mr Bush and Senator Kerry are locked in a dead heat. \"That's what we're doing, we're changing the world, and this will be liberty central.\" </p> <p>In the days leading up to the Republican convention, Mr Bush admitted that he had miscalculated the scale of the Iraqi insurgency and the \"catastrophic success\" of the US-led invasion. He also mused that the war on terror could not be won. </p> <p>That uncertainty was banished last night as he used the convention to re-establish his credentials as a resolute wartime leader. \"What the US is going to do is provide the conditions where liberty can rise up.\" </p> <p>The four-day convention was also characterised by the vitriol and derision aimed at Senator Kerry. The Democratic party will begin its post-convention counter-attack today by attempting to force the debate back to bread-and-butter economic issue.</p>",
  "From the time he took silk in 1966, it was a rare week when Basil Wigoder, who has died aged 83, could not be found in an important case at the Old Bailey. As a life peer, he was an active Liberal. <p>Born in Manchester, he was the son of a dentist father and a mother who was a magistrate. An open scholarship in modern history took him from Manchester grammar school to Oriel College, Oxford. For the last three years of the second world war he was in the Royal Artillery, and in 1945-46 he returned to Oxford, where he was president of the union, and was called to the bar, joining Gray's Inn. </p> <p>His career at the bar was mostly in criminal work. In 1951 he was led by AP Marshall, KC, in the case of Willcock v Muddle, which signalled the end of the use of wartime identity cards, and he remained a champion of the individual. </p> <p>A regular prosecutor, he appeared in such diverse cases as that of Anthony Reuter, the <i>soi-disant</i> King of the Teddy Boys, who, in 1956, received five years for malicious wounding, and that of a man fined \u00a350 in 1961 for kicking a greyhound in a race at Wembley. He was also much in demand as a defence lawyer, and over the years his clients included Lord Wigg, the former paymaster general, who was acquitted of kerb crawling; Sheila Buckley, the mistress of John Stonehouse, another former Labour minister, who faked his suicide in 1974; the artist Francis Bacon on a charge of possessing cannabis; and Alfred Berman, one of the defendants in the so-called Richardson torture trial of 1966. Unlike most of the other defendants in that case, Berman was acquitted. </p> <p>Another of Wigoder's clients was Jonathan Aitken, accused in 1971 under the Official Secrets Act of passing classified information to the Sunday Telegraph about the Biafran war. Wigoder argued success fully that it was his duty \"in the interests of the state\" to have done so. Variations on the defence have been regularly used since the case. Over the years Wigoder was a constant critic of some of the provisions of the act, which he regarded as illiberal and unfair. </p> <p>His first defence after becoming a QC was a successful appearance before the severe Mr Justice Thesiger on behalf of a man charged with the murder of a fellow guest at a party in Notting Hill. Wigoder argued that the man was defending himself against an unprovoked attack. </p> <p>That same year he appeared in the curious case of a Nigerian student, Mr Orishagbemi, accused of murdering his tenant. The defence was that the girl was a witch who had cast a spell on both Orishagbemi and his wife; Orishagbemi had merely been endeavouring to exorcise the spell. Given the unpromising material on this occasion, it is not surprising Wigoder was unsuccessful. </p> <p>Wigoder also appeared in a number of IRA trials, including acting for a defendant in the Aldershot bombing, and the Guildford four, convicted of a pub bombing in 1975. Their convictions were overturned 14 years later. </p> <p>Although in 1974 Wigoder entered the House of Lords, he was one of many barristers who had tried their hand, initially unsuccessfully, at politics. In 1945 he was defeated in the general election, standing as a Liberal candidate for Bournemouth. He finished ahead of the Labour candidate, but in the October of the same year was third in a byelection for that constituency. </p> <p>In 1957 and 1964 he was unsuccessful as a candidate for Westbury, in Wiltshire. He became chairman of the Liberal party executive in 1963, and was chairman of the conference organising committee in 1965-66. He was made Liberal chief whip in the Lords from 1977 to 1984, and spoke on home and health service affairs from 1983 to 1988. In his speeches in the Lords, he was highly critical of government proposals both to reduce the right of trial by jury and effectively give the prosecution a right of appeal in so-called lenient sentencing cases. He thought the problem had been exaggerated. </p> <p>Described by one barrister as \"a very nice, typical Mancunian, down-to-earth and with no pomposity or flannel\", in and out of court Wigoder was both well-liked and respected by his colleagues at the bar. </p> <p>Wigoder was a recorder of the crown court from 1972 to 1984. During that time he co-chaired with Lewis Hawser QC a Justice committee that recommended the transfer of criminal prosecutions by the police to an independent department of public prosecutions. In 1967, he was a Board of Trade inspector appointed to examine the conduct of Pinnock Finance. </p> <p>He was a member of the general council of the bar for four years from 1970, and served on the crown court rules committee (1971-77). In 1972, along with Jeremy Hutchinson, John Hazan and Michael Hill, he founded the Criminal Bar Association. In 1977 he was appointed chairman of the Health Services Board and, after it was abolished by Margaret Thatcher in 1980, he was chairman of BUPA (1981-92), and then its vice president. He was also vice president of the Statute Society (1984-90). </p> <p>Describing himself as a life-long leg spinner, he retired from village green cricket at the age of 64, when he felt his fielding was letting the side down. He remarked on one occasion: \"I am told you can play cricket better after a marijuana cigarette than after a couple of pints of beer,\" but there is no suggestion he ever tried to put the theory into practice. </p> <p>He is survived by his wife, the former Yoland Levinson, whom he married in 1948, and by their twin son and daughter, and two further sons. </p> <p> <b> Celia Thomas writes:</b> Lord Wigoder was appointed Liberal chief whip by Lord Byers, the party's leader in the Lords. They forged a close and much-respected partnership in the dedicated, but relatively small, band of Liberal peers. As well as keeping his flock informed about when they were required to vote, Wigoder also liked on occasions to send round a note telling them what they were voting about, and why. One bill which he expected to fight hard was the Tories' Protection Of Official Information Bill in November 1979 - their first attempt to reform the Official Secrets Act - but this was dropped after being excoriated by peers from all round the house, of which Wigoder was one. </p> <p>Being chief whip certainly did not silence him, as is the custom in the other parties. He took full part in all criminal justice legislation, and in debates about the freedom of the press. His dry-as-a-bone sense of humour sometimes landed him in trouble in the chamber, as some peers did not realise that he was pulling their legs, and he pleaded with his staff to do all they could to stop him telling jokes in the House. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Basil Thomas Wigoder, Baron Wigoder of Cheetham, lawyer and politician, born February 12 1921; died August 12 2004&lt;</p>",
  "A defrocked Irish priest who sabotaged the men's Olympic marathon by leaping on the race leader appeared in court in London yesterday on child indecency charges. <p>Cornelius \"Neil\" Horan, 57, was given a one-year suspended sentence by a judge in Athens after he pushed the Brazilian athlete Vanderlei de Lima into the crowd on the final day of the games on Sunday. </p> <p>De Lima, who had a 40-second lead when he was pushed at the 22-mile stage, finished in third place. </p> <p>Mr Horan, from Kerry but now living in Nunhead, south-east London, denies two counts of indecency with a child. The offences allegedly took place between September 1990 and April 1993. </p> <p>At yesterday's hearing at Woolwich crown court, Judge Michael Carroll ordered that he should not leave his south-east London postal district before his trial on October 25, except to see his solicitor by appointment. He must also report to the police daily. </p> <p>Outside court Mr Horan said the bail conditions had forced him to postpone a trip to Brazil to apologise to De Lima. He said he believed the runner would appreciate his remorse, although he was prepared for rejection.</p>"
