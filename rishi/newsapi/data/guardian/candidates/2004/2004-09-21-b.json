  "At a recent dinner in London attended mainly by Arab ambassadors and Foreign Office diplomats, there was discussion over lamb and rice of whether the Middle East would be better off under a George Bush or John Kerry presidency. <p>Some of the Arab ambassadors, surprisingly, came out for Mr Bush. </p> <p>Less surprising, perhaps, the Foreign Office diplomats were unanimous in favour of Mr Kerry. </p> <p>Sir Ivor Roberts, the British ambassador to Italy, echoed the same sentiments as his colleagues when he spoke at the weekend at the Anglo-Italian annual conference at Pontignano, near Siena, Tuscany. </p> <p>The conference, like the dinner in London, was conducted under Chatham House rules, meaning it was supposed to be off the record, allowing people to speak more freely. </p> <p>But Sir Ivor was unlucky to find his comments leaked to the Italian press and faces a rebuke from his masters for making public what is a widespread view within the Foreign Office. </p> <p>One of those present at the meeting said yesterday: \"You have a choice. You can do it on the record with people sitting as mute as maggots. That would be boring. Or you can be discreet and allow people to be open.\" </p> <p>The antipathy towards Mr Bush is mainly because of the aggressiveness demonstrated by the neo-conservatives in the US administration across a wide swathe of foreign policy. </p> <p>The dislike is felt hardest within the Foreign Office Middle East department, which despairs of the lack of engagement by the White House in trying to find an Israeli-Palestinian peace settlement and Mr Bush's overt support for the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon. </p> <p>Post-September 11, the Foreign Office accepted the need for the invasion of Afghanistan but advocated accompanying this with a propaganda and education drive throughout the Middle East to try to win hearts and minds and minimise support for al-Qaida: the second part did not happen, at least not in any significant way. </p> <p>The Foreign Office, as disclosed in the Hutton and Butler inquiries and again in internal papers leaked at the weekend to the Daily Telegraph, initially opposed war in Iraq. </p> <p>They argued that war would be much worse than the status quo, which at the time was a policy of containment, keeping Saddam Hussein weak through a combination of international sanctions and the retention of no-fly zones in northern and southern Iraq. </p> <p>Downing Street rejected the Foreign Office line and Tony Blair instead went with Mr Bush. </p> <p>Once it became clear that Mr Bush was intent on war, the Foreign Office loyally got back into line, arguing, without much conviction, that Saddam would have presented a threat a few years later and at least war would deal with that. </p> <p>But the Foreign Office continued to express its misgivings. A report from the joint intelligence committee in the run-up to the war reflected Foreign Office thinking: it warned that there was no link between Saddam and al-Qaida but an invasion and the subsequent post-war chaos could create conditions beneficial to al-Qaida and its sympathisers, as has happened. </p> <p>In the immediate post-war period, there was further tension between the Foreign Office and the US administration, mainly as a result of what was seen as heavy-handed tactics on the part of the US military. </p> <p>Not all Foreign Office diplomats see Mr Bush as the problem. </p> <p>One senior diplomat is more scathing about the vice-president, Dick Cheney, than about the president, portraying Mr Cheney as the main obstacle in the US administration to an Israeli-Palestinian deal. </p> <p>A British politician who has extensive dealings with the Foreign Office said the diplomats tended not to have a high opinion of Mr Bush but added that \"they don't have a high opinion of any world leaders\".</p>",
  "There is women's wrestling on the satellite TV, and Cairo's traffic police have turned out in force to watch. They slouch in the cafe, puffing on shishas, coughing, brushing away flies and drinking tea. <p>The tea comes in a glass with a thick sediment of leaves and sugar in the bottom. Slops spill over the brim and swill on a metal tray that rocks on a table that wobbles on the sawdust-covered floor. </p> <p>Cairo has a lot that wobbles or doesn't work quite as it should. In the fashionable Zamalek district even the streets can be hazardous. Pavements are an obstacle course of loose manhole covers, obtruding pipework, missing paving stones, assorted debris and the occasional cat. </p> <p>And one way or another, most of the country's social infrastructure resembles Zamalek's pavement obstacle course. </p> <p>Today the National Democratic party, which has monopolised Egyptian politics for decades, begins a three-day conference which it has heralded as a big step towards sorting out the mess. </p> <p>Reform has been a long time coming, and critics say it is only happening now because of US pressure. Committees have travelled the world to see what works elsewhere, and how reforms have been implemented. One of the ideas from Britain is an Egyptian version of Ofsted. </p> <p>\"We're not re-inventing the wheel,\" said Hossam Badrawi, who chairs the party's education committee. The reformers acknowledge, though, that their biggest problem is in changing attitudes, both among officials who treat red tape as a way to line their pockets and among traditional-minded citizens. </p> <p>There is widespread ignorance; Dr Badrawi has ambitious plans to help children with special needs, but some parents are aghast, believing that contact with other children will spread the \"infection\". </p> <p>There is also apathy. On the streets of Cairo yesterday Egyptians were reluctant to talk about reform. \"Sorry, I don't get into politics,\" said one young man. An unofficial tourist tout, who moments earlier had been offering a visit to a perfume shop, hurried away when asked. </p> <p>Arafat, a taxi driver relaxing with three friends in Tahrir Square, had no complaints. \"It's not perfect but it's OK,\" he said. \"Everything is better than 20 years ago.\" </p> <p><b>Paperwork</b></p> <p>In fact, laws and officialdom stand in the way of almost everything. For foreign investors the paperwork to set up a company in Egypt takes two months. In Jordan it takes a day, and in thriving Dubai 20 minutes.</p> <p>This year some advertising creatives thought it would be fun to sell bumper stickers saying: \"Cairo traffic rules. Green: stop. Red: go. Yellow: go faster.\" Four were arrested for \"defaming Egypt\" and kept in jail until a judge decided the charges were daft.</p> <p>Under a decree dating back to the time of Nasser it is illegal to compile statistics without government permission. This applies not only to opinion pollsters but to students doing fieldwork. </p> <p>The authorised statistics about President Hosni Mubarak are that he is 76 and has been in power for almost 23 years. His current (fourth) term in office ends next year and, despite two recent health scares - one in which he collapsed in front of the TV cameras - many expect him to seek another term in a referendum. There is also much speculation that the president's 41-year-old son, Gamal, is being groomed for power. Suave, go-ahead, and immersed in economics, he might even be a good choice were it not for his family name.</p> <p>When Gamal and reforms are packaged together, however, critics claim that the reforms are merely a way of promoting Gamal - and Egyptians seem hostile to the idea of a Syrian-style inherited presidency. </p> <p>The other, possibly decisive, factor in the presidential wrangling is the Egyptian army, which expects presidents to have a military background and is thought to favour the intelligence chief Omar Suleiman. </p> <p>While the NDP prefers to focus on economics and education, it is also considering limited political reforms, including tinkering with the rules on the formation of political parties. </p> <p>This month, though, eight of the officially recognised opposition parties got together to demand far-reaching constitutional changes that would allow a free and direct election of the country's next leader.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a non-authorised group, which includes such odd bedfellows as the Muslim Brotherhood, the Communists and human-rights activists, has formed the Popular Campaign for Change, under the slogans \"No to a new mandate\" and \"No to inheritance of the presidency\". </p> <p>Its first press conference was blocked by the authorities, but the campaigners are now trying to commission an opinion poll on what Egyptians think of another term for Mr Mubarak, and the question of hereditary succession. </p> <p>Since this involves compiling statistics, it requires government permission. The campaigners, anticipating a refusal, are preparing to go to court - something that they believe will also help to mobilise public opinion. </p> <p><b>Emergency</b> </p> <p>Ahmed Seif al-Islam, a lawyer and one of the group's organisers, believes President Mubarak is deeply unpopular and that people have become bolder in showing their feelings about him. He cites a demonstration against the Iraq war last year: \"The only property damaged was a picture of Hosni Mubarak outside the party building.\" </p> <p>Asked what would happen if Egyptians were given a free choice for their next president, he replied: \"They would choose someone from the Muslim Brotherhood. Not because they accept the brotherhood's programme, but because they hate the regime.\" </p> <p>Opposition calls to lift emergency laws, which have been in force since the assassination of President Anwar Sadat in 1981, are also supported by some in the ruling NDP. </p> <p>Originally intended to deal with Islamist militants, the \"emergency\" has been an excuse for all sorts of other crackdowns over the years, including the rounding up of dozens of gay men at a disco in 2001, supposedly because they posed a threat to national security. </p> <p>So far, though, the NDP has resisting radical political change. The official line, as set out by the party's secretary-general, Safwat el-Sherif, is that too much talk of constitutional reform \"will open the door to foreign intervention in domestic affairs\". </p> <p>Even the ostensibly safer ground of economic and educational reform - the two subjects being tackled by the three-day reform conference - is not without political risks for President Mubarak. When the government cut subsidies on diesel fuel this month bus fares shot up by 50%, causing frayed tempers in the teeming streets of Cairo. That increase is probably only the first of many, and the price of diesel at the pump is still only a third of what it really costs. </p> <p>For Iman el-Kaffass, who chairs the Egyptian Association for Education and Development, the secret of successful reform is in how it is explained to the public. </p> <p>When the government wanted to base secondary school certificates on three years' assessment rather than final exams, many parents objected. </p> <p>\"To persuade them, you have to know what to mention,\" Ms Kaffass said. </p> <p>\"In the rural areas, for example, people are more religious, so you talk to them about how God decides to send people to heaven or hell. You tell them God's decision is not based on final-year exams, it's based on cumulative assessment. And they agree.\"</p>",
  "It is perhaps not surprising that the battle between George Bush and John Kerry has turned so nasty - it is, after all, a family affair. Both men are descendants of the same Essex man. <p>Their common ancestor was a member of the minor Essex gentry called Edmund Reade who was born and died in Wickford without ever seeing the New World his offspring would fight over 400 years later. </p> <p>However, Reade's daughters, Elizabeth and Margaret, both sailed to New England with their mother, probably in the 1630s. Both had married into powerful families, Winthrop and Lake, who ultimately begot the two presidential candidates. </p> <p>The common heritage makes the president and Senator Kerry ninth cousins, twice removed, according to Gary Boyd Roberts, a Massachusetts genealogist who has researched their family backgrounds. </p> <p>\"They were part of the upper classes in the 1560s and they are still part of the upper classes,\" Mr Roberts said, but pointed out that Mr Kerry has more \"cosmopolitan\" elements in his family tree. </p> <p>His father's side of the family were Jews from the Austro-Hungarian empire who converted to Catholicism and changed their name from K\u00f6hn to Kerry before emigrating to America in 1904. </p> <p>Mr Bush, the son of a former president and grandson of a senator, can trace his lineage to the Mayflower immigrants, and to some of the oldest families in the country. The only exotic element is a \"sliver of Swiss and German on his mother's side\", Mr Roberts said. </p> <p>The Essex connection is the closest bloodline linking the candidates, but they have seven other common ancestors.</p>",
  "Sir Ivor Roberts, the British ambassador to Italy, who reportedly believes that President George Bush is the \"greatest recruiting sergeant for al-Qaida\", may have committed a diplomatic indiscretion, but he has done a service to those people who are unhappy with the government's record on the war in Iraq. Sir Ivor, a highly regarded official, apparently believed he was speaking off the record when he expressed this view at a conference in Tuscany - according to the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera. The statement itself is hardly original or surprising, but the fact that it has been made public provides powerful evidence that some senior civil servants were and are opposed to Tony Blair's unqualified backing for Mr Bush's war strategy. Such a candid appraisal should be embarrassing for a prime minister who has rebuffed criticism by the Hutton and Butler enquiries as well as repeatedly insisting that the world is safer with Saddam Hussein behind bars. John Kerry, the Democratic presidential candidate, also disagreed with this yesterday, accusing his Republican rival of \"colossal errors of judgment\" and diverting resources from the war on terrorism. <p>Barely a day now goes by without some new assault on the government's arguments. Last week came definitive confirmation - from the Iraqi Survey Group - that Saddam did not in fact possess any weapons of mass destruction, the main casus belli for the US and Britain. That was followed by an uncharacteristically blunt statement by Kofi Annan, the UN secretary-general, that the war was illegal. Mr Blair's comment on Sunday that Iraq is now the \"crucible\" in which the war on terrorism will be won or lost will infuriate those who have long pointed out that there was no terrorism of this kind in Iraq before the war. Its secular Ba'athist dictatorship had many faults, some of them overlooked or underplayed by critics of the US and British governments, but as the British intelligence services reported consistently, it had no links with the fundamentalist al-Qaida. Mr Blair has often argued that the key issue for him was the possible nexus between WMD and terrorists. But we now know that in February 2003, the joint intelligence committee reported that al-Qaida and associated groups continued to represent \"by far the greatest terrorist threat to western interests, and that that threat would be heightened by military action against Iraq\". Tragically, the mayhem of the post-Saddam era is fertile ground for the al-Qaida affiliate led by the Jordanian Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, who is threatening the lives of a British engineer and two Americans. Other westerners are being held hostage whether or not their governments were part of the coalition of the willing that marched on Baghdad last March. Iraq has become a rallying-cry for Jihadists across the world. </p> <p>Newly leaked Cabinet Office and Foreign Office documents have exposed the secret manoeuvring behind Blair's decision to go to war. These show that in March 2002 he was more concerned about regime change than, as he said publicly, with the danger from WMD. They also reveal that British officials believed privately that Mr Bush wanted to complete his father's unfinished 1991 business in a \"grudge match\" against the Iraqi leader. Equally damaging is the revelation that Jack Straw, the foreign secretary, predicted that postwar Iraq would face serious problems, not least of which was that the country had no history of democracy. Sir David Manning, the prime minister's foreign policy adviser, observed that Mr Bush had no idea what was likely to happen \"on the morning after.\" Iraq, the US, Britain, and the world are now well beyond the morning after, and as Sir Ivor has inadvertently reminded us, there are still many troubling questions to answer.</p>",
  "<p>The most memorable achievement of Jos\u00e9 Antonio Camacho's four months at the Bernab\u00e9u was to keep Ronaldo's waistline in trim. Anyone who can get the self-indulgent Brazilian to knuckle down has to be saluted but the Real Madrid head coach resigned after deciding that he could not bring any such sense of proportion to the club itself. </p> <p>Real have been bloated for too long, puffed up by their own boastfulness and by the credulous way in which others have parroted their claims. Reality should have been good enough. Over the past few years there have been exciting and artful performances to be relished in Europe and beyond. </p> <p>This club, however, could not settle for that. They pretended that with commercial genius and a brash transfer market policy they had somehow broken new ground in football history. It is purely Real's self-presentation that has been miraculous. </p> <p>Whether putting himself or the team on display, Florentino P\u00e9rez has been a publicist of genius and he swept to re-election as president this summer despite a trophy-less season. It takes strong nerves to remember that it is actually Valencia, with two of the last three La Liga titles, who have dominated the Spanish scene. </p> <p>There has been too little scorn of Real's beautifully projected image as the club whose wealth brooks no resistance. The spectacle of the David Beckham signing a year ago was so absorbing that it almost went unnoticed that the deal was offset by the sale, release or loaning out of a dozen players. </p> <p>Sport, however, exposes the truth sooner or later. Real had been left with so hopelessly meagre a squad that an unprepared footballer could be humiliated. During a 4-1 pounding at Sevilla the young defender Rub\u00e9n Gonz\u00e1lez had to be substituted after 26 minutes and was then seen sobbing on the bench. </p> <p>There would be more tears to be shed by others before the close of a season in which defeat in the Champions League quarter-final pointed the way to five consecutive losses at the close of the La Liga programme. Only when the club folds away its finely embroidered myths about itself can it start to recover. </p> <p>In simple sporting terms the situation is not irredeemable. Last week's 3-0 defeat at Bayer Leverkusen, shaming as it was, merely marked the start of a Champions League group. Nor is it such a disgrace to go down 1-0 at Espanyol, as they did on Saturday, when Zin\u00e9dine Zidane and Luis Figo were joined on the injury list by Iker Casillas, who dislocated a finger in the warm-up. </p> <p>After falling to bruising defeats Real ought to realise, however, that it is time to give up the high-wire act. Virtuosity did hold them safe above all contenders for a while and it was epitomised by the contortionist's volley from Zidane that delivered the astounding winner over Leverkusen in the 2002 Champions League final. </p> <p>The Frenchman, however, is now old enough to have retired from international football and Figo is detaching himself from Portugal's cause. Ronaldo is younger but no one can be sure that he can still deliver the sort of hat-trick that inspired a standing ovation from a superbly sportsmanlike Old Trafford in 2003. </p> <p>The gal\u00e1cticos are waning and no new ones exist for P\u00e9rez to summon. There has been a rethink at the Bernab\u00e9u, with Emilio Butrague\u00f1o replacing Jorge Valdano as technical director, but it has a fair distance yet to go. Jonathan Woodgate and Walter Samuel, the two costly centre-halves, will not by themselves give adequate depth to the squad. </p> <p>Recognising the intractable egos on the playing staff and a shortage of challengers for their pegs in the dressing room, Camacho abandoned his post. Real have not seen silverware since Vicente Del Bosque, who had already supplied two Champions League honours, landed the La Liga trophy in 2003. The immediate sacking of that low-key figure snapped the last link with reality. </p> <p>Now Real have to re-establish contact with humility. The side, with Zidane at his peak, was a joy but it never deserved to be ranked with, say, the Milan of the early 1990s, who could complement Frank Rijkaard, Ruud Gullit and Marco van Basten with native sons such as Franco Baresi and Paolo Maldini to produce extraordinary all-round strength. </p> <p>When the current consternation fades, P\u00e9rez should change tack and dedicate himself to giving us a team that is cherished more than any of the great stars it might happen to contain.</p>",
  "President George Bush today used his speech to the United Nations general assembly to defend the US-led mission in Iraq as having \"enforced the demands of the world\". <p>Mr Bush was speaking five days after the UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, described the decision to go to war in Iraq without the security council's approval as \"illegal\".</p> <p>In a strongly-worded speech that could be seen as a direct response to Mr Annan's comments - and perhaps as an implicit critique of the UN's reluctance to support military action - Mr Bush said there was a need to \"fight radicalism and terror with justice and dignity\".</p> <p>He said the US-led coalition had helped rid Iraq of a \"criminal dictator\" who flouted UN resolutions for more than a decade. Despite the hopes of peaceful nations, he said, \"eventually, there is no safety in looking away, seeking the quiet life by ignoring the struggles and oppression of others\".</p> <p>The president, in an address that also sought to highlight his security credentials ahead of November's national elections, said terrorists believe that \"suicide and murder are justified ... and they act on their beliefs\".</p> <p>Citing recent atrocities, such as the death of dozens of children held hostage in a school in Beslan, southern Russia, Mr Bush said \"civilised nations are in this struggle together, and all must fight the murderers\".</p> <p>In the face of criticism from his Democratic presidential challenger John Kerry, who said Mr Bush's policies had made the world a more dangerous place, he said that \"a free Iraq in the heart of the Middle East will be a decisive blow against [the terrorists'] ambitions in that region\".</p> <p>Ahead of Mr Bush's speech, Mr Annan opened the meeting of the 191-nation gathering with a warning that \"the rule of law\" is at risk around the world. </p> <p>\"No one is above the law. Again and again, we see fundamental laws shamelessly disregarded - those that ordain respect for innocent life, for civilians, for the vulnerable - especially children,\" he said. </p> <p>He condemned the taking and killing of hostages in Iraq, but also reminded delegates that Iraqi prisoners had been \"disgracefully abused\", an implicit criticism of the treatment of detainees at Abu Ghraib prison near Baghdad. </p> <p>Mr Bush made no reference to the prisoner abuse scandal, but he called on the UN to help with the reconstruction of Iraq, a mission that has been severely hampered by a growing insurgency and the deaths of more than 1,000 US troops.</p> <p>\"The people of Iraq have regained sovereignty,\" he said, noting that the prime minister of Iraq's interim government, Ayad Allawi, was among those attending the session. </p> <p>\"The UN and its member nations must respond to Prime Minister Allawi's request and do more to help build an Iraq that is secure, democratic, federal and free.</p> <p>As elections approach in both Afghanistan and Iraq, \"we can expect terror attacks to escalate\", Mr Bush said. But \"the proper response to difficulty is not to retreat, it is to prevail\".</p> <p>In comments that could have significant implications for the stalled Middle East process, President Bush also called on Israel to impose a freeze on Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza and to dismantle \"unauthorised outposts\". </p> <p>He issued a direct challenge to the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, saying: \"Israel should impose a settlement freeze, dismantle unauthorised outposts, end the daily humiliation of the Palestinian people, and avoid any actions that prejudice final negotiations.\"</p> <p>He added that world leaders should \"withdraw all favour and support from any Palestinian ruler who fails his people and betrays their cause\".</p> <p>Mr Bush's speech, lasting just under 20 minutes, included an appeal for more humanitarian involvement, ranging from helping to end the bloody conflict in Sudan to fighting Aids in Africa. His remarks drew applause only once - at the end of his speech.</p> <p>He also told the gathering that he would support a resolution sponsored by Costa Rica calling for a comprehensive ban on human cloning, and said he would be proposing a \"democracy fund\" to help countries develop \"the rule of law and independent courts, a free press, political parties and trade unions\".</p>",
  "Mr. Secretary General, Mr. President, distinguished delegates, ladies and gentlemen: Thank you for the honor of addressing this General Assembly. The American people respect the idealism that gave life to this organization. And we respect the men and women of the U.N., who stand for peace and human rights in every part of the world. Welcome to New York City, and welcome to the United States of America. <p>During the past three years, I've addressed this General Assembly in a time of tragedy for my country, and in times of decision for all of us. Now we gather at a time of tremendous opportunity for the U.N. and for all peaceful nations. For decades, the circle of liberty and security and development has been expanding in our world. This progress has brought unity to Europe, self-government to Latin America and Asia, and new hope to Africa. Now we have the historic chance to widen the circle even further, to fight radicalism and terror with justice and dignity, to achieve a true peace, founded on human freedom. </p> <p>The United Nations and my country share the deepest commitments. Both the American Declaration of Independence and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaim the equal value and dignity of every human life. That dignity is honored by the rule of law, limits on the power of the state, respect for women, protection of private property, free speech, equal justice, and religious tolerance. That dignity is dishonored by oppression, corruption, tyranny, bigotry, terrorism and all violence against the innocent. And both of our founding documents affirm that this bright line between justice and injustice -- between right and wrong -- is the same in every age, and every culture, and every nation. </p> <p>Wise governments also stand for these principles for very practical and realistic reasons. We know that dictators are quick to choose aggression, while free nations strive to resolve differences in peace. We know that oppressive governments support terror, while free governments fight the terrorists in their midst. We know that free peoples embrace progress and life, instead of becoming the recruits for murderous ideologies. </p> <p>Every nation that wants peace will share the benefits of a freer world. And every nation that seeks peace has an obligation to help build that world. Eventually, there is no safe isolation from terror networks, or failed states that shelter them, or outlaw regimes, or weapons of mass destruction. Eventually, there is no safety in looking away, seeking the quiet life by ignoring the struggles and oppression of others. </p> <p>In this young century, our world needs a new definition of security. Our security is not merely found in spheres of influence, or some balance of power. The security of our world is found in the advancing rights of mankind. </p> <p>These rights are advancing across the world -- and across the world, the enemies of human rights are responding with violence. Terrorists and their allies believe the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the American Bill of Rights, and every charter of liberty ever written, are lies, to be burned and destroyed and forgotten. They believe that dictators should control every mind and tongue in the Middle East and beyond. They believe that suicide and torture and murder are fully justified to serve any goal they declare. And they act on their beliefs. </p> <p>In the last year alone, terrorists have attacked police stations, and banks, and commuter trains, and synagogues -- and a school filled with children. This month in Beslan we saw, once again, how the terrorists measure their success -- in the death of the innocent, and in the pain of grieving families. Svetlana Dzebisov was held hostage, along with her son and her nephew -- her nephew did not survive. She recently visited the cemetery, and saw what she called the \"little graves.\" She said, \"I understand that there is evil in the world. But what have these little creatures done?\" </p> <p>Members of the United Nations, the Russian children did nothing to deserve such awful suffering, and fright, and death. The people of Madrid and Jerusalem and Istanbul and Baghdad have done nothing to deserve sudden and random murder. These acts violate the standards of justice in all cultures, and the principles of all religions. All civilized nations are in this struggle together, and all must fight the murderers. </p> <p>We're determined to destroy terror networks wherever they operate, and the United States is grateful to every nation that is helping to seize terrorist assets, track down their operatives, and disrupt their plans. We're determined to end the state sponsorship of terror -- and my nation is grateful to all that participated in the liberation of Afghanistan. We're determined to prevent proliferation, and to enforce the demands of the world -- and my nation is grateful to the soldiers of many nations who have helped to deliver the Iraqi people from an outlaw dictator. </p> <p>The dictator agreed in 1991, as a condition of a cease-fire, to fully comply with all Security Council resolutions -- then ignored more than a decade of those resolutions. Finally, the Security Council promised serious consequences for his defiance. And the commitments we make must have meaning. When we say \"serious consequences,\" for the sake of peace, there must be serious consequences. And so a coalition of nations enforced the just demands of the world. </p> <p>Defending our ideals is vital, but it is not enough. Our broader mission as U.N. members is to apply these ideals to the great issues of our time. Our wider goal is to promote hope and progress as the alternatives to hatred and violence. Our great purpose is to build a better world beyond the war on terror. </p> <p>Because we believe in human dignity, America and many nations have established a global fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. In three years the contributing countries have funded projects in more than 90 countries, and pledged a total of $5.6 billion to these efforts. America has undertaken a $15 billion effort to provide prevention and treatment and humane care in nations afflicted by AIDS, placing a special focus on 15 countries where the need is most urgent. AIDS is the greatest health crisis of our time, and our unprecedented commitment will bring new hope to those who have walked too long in the shadow of death. </p> <p>Because we believe in human dignity, America and many nations have joined together to confront the evil of trafficking in human beings. We're supporting organizations that rescue the victims, passing stronger anti-trafficking laws, and warning travelers that they will be held to account for supporting this modern form of slavery. Women and children should never be exploited for pleasure or greed, anywhere on Earth. </p> <p>Because we believe in human dignity, we should take seriously the protection of life from exploitation under any pretext. In this session, the U.N. will consider a resolution sponsored by Costa Rica calling for a comprehensive ban on human cloning. I support that resolution and urge all governments to affirm a basic ethical principle: No human life should ever be produced or destroyed for the benefit of another. </p> <p>Because we believe in human dignity, America and many nations have changed the way we fight poverty, curb corruption, and provide aid. In 2002 we created the Monterrey Consensus, a bold approach that links new aid from developed nations to real reform in developing ones. And through the Millennium Challenge Account, my nation is increasing our aid to developing nations that expand economic freedom and invest in the education and health of their own people. </p> <p>Because we believe in human dignity, America and many nations have acted to lift the crushing burden of debt that limits the growth of developing economies, and holds millions of people in poverty. Since these efforts began in 1996, poor countries with the heaviest debt burdens have received more than $30 billion of relief. And to prevent the build-up of future debt, my country and other nations have agreed that international financial institutions should increasingly provide new aid in the form of grants, rather than loans. </p> <p>Because we believe in human dignity, the world must have more effective means to stabilize regions in turmoil, and to halt religious violence and ethnic cleansing. We must create permanent capabilities to respond to future crises. The United States and Italy have proposed a Global Peace Operations Initiative. G-8 countries will train 75,000 peacekeepers, initially from Africa, so they can conduct operations on that continent and elsewhere. The countries of the G-8 will help this peacekeeping force with deployment and logistical needs. </p> <p>At this hour, the world is witnessing terrible suffering and horrible crimes in the Darfur region of Sudan, crimes my government has concluded are genocide. The United States played a key role in efforts to broker a cease-fire, and we're providing humanitarian assistance to the Sudanese people. Rwanda and Nigeria have deployed forces in Sudan to help improve security so aid can be delivered. The Security Council adopted a new resolution that supports an expanded African Union force to help prevent further bloodshed, and urges the government of Sudan to stop flights by military aircraft in Darfur. We congratulate the members of the Council on this timely and necessary action. I call on the government of Sudan to honor the cease-fire it signed, and to stop the killing in Darfur. </p> <p>Because we believe in human dignity, peaceful nations must stand for the advance of democracy. No other system of government has done more to protect minorities, to secure the rights of labor, to raise the status of women, or to channel human energy to the pursuits of peace. We've witnessed the rise of democratic governments in predominantly Hindu and Muslim, Buddhist, Jewish and Christian cultures. Democratic institutions have taken root in modern societies, and in traditional societies. When it comes to the desire for liberty and justice, there is no clash of civilizations. People everywhere are capable of freedom, and worthy of freedom. </p> <p>Finding the full promise of representative government takes time, as America has found in two centuries of debate and struggle. Nor is there any -- only one form of representative government -- because democracies, by definition, take on the unique character of the peoples that create them. Yet this much we know with certainty: The desire for freedom resides in every human heart. And that desire cannot be contained forever by prison walls, or martial laws, or secret police. Over time, and across the Earth, freedom will find a way. </p> <p>Freedom is finding a way in Iraq and Afghanistan -- and we must continue to show our commitment to democracies in those nations. The liberty that many have won at a cost must be secured. As members of the United Nations, we all have a stake in the success of the world's newest democracies. </p> <p>Not long ago, outlaw regimes in Baghdad and Kabul threatened the peace and sponsored terrorists. These regimes destabilized one of the world's most vital -- and most volatile -- regions. They brutalized their peoples, in defiance of all civilized norms. Today, the Iraqi and Afghan people are on the path to democracy and freedom. The governments that are rising will pose no threat to others. Instead of harboring terrorists, they're fighting terrorist groups. And this progress is good for the long-term security of us all. </p> <p>The Afghan people are showing extraordinary courage under difficult conditions. They're fighting to defend their nation from Taliban holdouts, and helping to strike against the terrorists killers. They're reviving their economy. They've adopted a constitution that protects the rights of all, while honoring their nation's most cherished traditions. More than 10 million Afghan citizens -- over 4 million of them women -- are now registered to vote in next month's presidential election. To any who still would question whether Muslim societies can be democratic societies, the Afghan people are giving their answer. </p> <p>Since the last meeting of this General Assembly, the people of Iraq have regained sovereignty. Today, in this hall, the Prime Minister of Iraq and his delegation represent a country that has rejoined the community of nations. The government of Prime Minister Allawi has earned the support of every nation that believes in self-determination and desires peace. And under Security Council resolutions 1511 and 1546, the world is providing that support. The U.N., and its member nations, must respond to Prime Minister Allawi's request, and do more to help build an Iraq that is secure, democratic, federal, and free. </p> <p>A democratic Iraq has ruthless enemies, because terrorists know the stakes in that country. They know that a free Iraq in the heart of the Middle East will be a decisive blow against their ambitions for that region. So a terrorists group associated with al Qaeda is now one of the main groups killing the innocent in Iraq today -- conducting a campaign of bombings against civilians, and the beheadings of bound men. Coalition forces now serving in Iraq are confronting the terrorists and foreign fighters, so peaceful nations around the world will never have to face them within our own borders. </p> <p>Our coalition is standing beside a growing Iraqi security force. The NATO Alliance is providing vital training to that force. More than 35 nations have contributed money and expertise to help rebuild Iraq's infrastructure. And as the Iraqi interim government moves toward national elections, officials from the United Nations are helping Iraqis build the infrastructure of democracy. These selfless people are doing heroic work, and are carrying on the great legacy of Sergio de Mello. </p> <p>As we have seen in other countries, one of the main terrorist goals is to undermine, disrupt, and influence election outcomes. We can expect terrorist attacks to escalate as Afghanistan and Iraq approach national elections. The work ahead is demanding. But these difficulties will not shake our conviction that the future of Afghanistan and Iraq is a future of liberty. The proper response to difficulty is not to retreat, it is to prevail. </p> <p>The advance of freedom always carries a cost, paid by the bravest among us. America mourns the losses to our nation, and to many others. And today, I assure every friend of Afghanistan and Iraq, and every enemy of liberty: We will stand with the people of Afghanistan and Iraq until their hopes of freedom and security are fulfilled. </p> <p>These two nations will be a model for the broader Middle East, a region where millions have been denied basic human rights and simple justice. For too long, many nations, including my own, tolerated, even excused, oppression in the Middle East in the name of stability. Oppression became common, but stability never arrived. We must take a different approach. We must help the reformers of the Middle East as they work for freedom, and strive to build a community of peaceful, democratic nations. </p> <p>This commitment to democratic reform is essential to resolving the Arab-Israeli conflict. Peace will not be achieved by Palestinian rulers who intimidate opposition, tolerate corruption, and maintain ties to terrorist groups. The longsuffering Palestinian people deserve better. They deserve true leaders capable of creating and governing a free and peaceful Palestinian state. </p> <p>Even after the setbacks and frustrations of recent months, goodwill and hard effort can achieve the promise of the road map to peace. Those who would lead a new Palestinian state should adopt peaceful means to achieve the rights of their people, and create the reformed institutions of a stable democracy. Arab states should end incitement in their own media, cut off public and private funding for terrorism, and establish normal relations with Israel. Israel should impose a settlement freeze, dismantle unauthorized outposts, end the daily humiliation of the Palestinian people, and avoid any actions that prejudice final negotiations. And world leaders should withdraw all favor and support from any Palestinian ruler who fails his people and betrays their cause. </p> <p>The democratic hopes we see growing in the Middle East are growing everywhere. In the words of the Burmese democracy advocate, Aung San Suu Kyi: \"We do not accept the notion that democracy is a Western value. To the contrary; democracy simply means good government rooted in responsibility, transparency, and accountability.\" Here at the United Nations, you know this to be true. In recent years, this organization has helped create a new democracy in East Timor, and the U.N. has aided other nations in making the transition to self-rule. </p> <p>Because I believe the advance of liberty is the path to both a safer and better world, today I propose establishing a Democracy Fund within the United Nations. This is a great calling for this great organization. The fund would help countries lay the foundations of democracy by instituting the rule of law and independent courts, a free press, political parties and trade unions. Money from the fund would also help set up voter precincts and polling places, and support the work of election monitors. To show our commitment to the new Democracy Fund, the United States will make an initial contribution. I urge other nations to contribute, as well. </p> <p>Today, I've outlined a broad agenda to advance human dignity, and enhance the security of all of us. The defeat of terror, the protection of human rights, the spread of prosperity, the advance of democracy -- these causes, these ideals, call us to great work in the world. Each of us alone can only do so much. Together, we can accomplish so much more. </p> <p>History will honor the high ideals of this organization. The charter states them with clarity: \"to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war,\" \"to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights,\" \"to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom.\" </p> <p>Let history also record that our generation of leaders followed through on these ideals, even in adversity. Let history show that in a decisive decade, members of the United Nations did not grow weary in our duties, or waver in meeting them. I'm confident that this young century will be liberty's century. I believe we will rise to this moment, because I know the character of so many nations and leaders represented here today. And I have faith in the transforming power of freedom. </p> <p>May God bless you.</p>",
  "<p>John Kerry sought to galvanise his campaign by delivering his most withering attack yet on George Bush's Iraq policy. Speaking in New York on Monday night, Mr Kerry said the administration's record was filled with \"deceptive statements and errors of judgment of historic proportions\".</p> <p>The tough speech must have been a tonic for Democratic supporters exasperated by Mr Kerry's inability to turn the administration's inept handling of Iraq to his advantage. He has been taking the fight to Mr Bush in recent days on issues from gun control to links between Halliburton, the oil services giant, and the administration, and now Iraq. </p> <p>But beating up on the president carries risks, notes Marc Sandalow of the <a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/09/19/KERRY.TMP\">San Franciso Chronicle</a>.</p> <p>If the attacks come across as too strident, they could alienate voters who are reluctant to change presidents during a war. Never at a loss on how to hit back, the Republicans are now calling Mr Kerry the new Howard Dean.</p> <p>George Packer, of the <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/talk/content/?040927ta_talk_packer\">New Yorker</a>, provides a useful compare and contrast exercise between Mr Bush's rhetoric on Iraq and the worsening situation there. He chronicles the White House's ruthless determination to put a positive spin on - or simply disregard - bad news from Iraq. Packer makes the telling observation that public approval of Mr Bush's handling of the war rose between May and September - just when coverage of events in Iraq dropped off the front pages of the Washington Post and the New York Times.</p> <p>Packer thinks the press is unfair in pressuring Mr Kerry for a detailed strategy on how to deal with the mess in Iraq. He writes: \"The president's actions have led the country into a blind alley; there's no new strategy for Kerry to propose, and the press should stop insisting that he come up with one when the candidate who started the war feels no such obligation.\"</p> <p>On Iraq, an issue on which Mr Kerry has been accused of flip-flopping, it is worth reading his <a href=\"http://www.independentsforkerry.org/uploads/media/kerry-iraq.html\">Senate speech</a> in October 2002 before his vote to grant Bush authority to go to war. Although the vote has been the source of much grief, the speech was actually a cogent argument, with Mr Kerry saying he would not support \"a unilateral war against Iraq unless the threat is imminent\".</p> <p>CK Rairden, of the <a href=\"http://www.washingtondispatch.com/opinion/article_10108.shtml\">Washington Dispatch</a>, sees a problem for Mr Kerry beyond Iraq - the man himself. Rairden, exasperated by Mr Kerry's inability to connect with the voters, calls him \"aloof and an absolute bore\", and says he had better loosen up or he will go down as Michael Dukakis II.</p> <p>Amid all the speeches and the campaigning, Kerry found time to appear on the <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,132973,00.html\">David Letterman</a> show where he came out with his \"top ten Bush tax </p> <p>proposals\". My favourite: Cheney can claim Bush as a dependent.</p>",
  "John Kerry fought to regain the initiative in the presidential race yesterday with a scathing attack on the Bush administration's policy in Iraq, accusing the president of bungling the war and lying to Americans about the seriousness of the situation. <p>In his most pointed assault so far on George Bush's handling of the conflict, Mr Kerry said the invasion had made the world \"a more dangerous place for America and Americans\", and put forward an exit strategy of his own. </p> <p>He called for the increased involvement of other countries in training the Iraqi security forces and guarding the country's borders, in return for participation in its oil industry and reconstruction contracts. </p> <p>In that way, he argued, the US could begin withdrawing its forces by next summer, and \"realistically aim to bring all our troops home within the next four years\". </p> <p>Speaking in New York on the eve of Mr Bush's scheduled address to the UN general assembly, Mr Kerry said the president should use the occasion to hold a summit on the future of Iraq, but said his opponent would face an uphill task of his own making. </p> <p>\"After insulting allies and shredding alliances, this president may not have the trust and confidence to bring others to our side in Iraq,\" he said. </p> <p>\"But we cannot hope to succeed unless we rebuild and lead strong alliances so that other nations share the burden...\" </p> <p>The speech at New York University was Mr Kerry's response to Democrat critics who have complained of his not being aggressive enough about Mr Bush's record, and followed a string of conflicting remarks in which he has failed to articulate his position clearly. </p> <p>President Bush hit back immediately. </p> <p>\"Today my opponent continued his pattern of twisting in the wind with new contradictions of his old positions on Iraq,\" he told supporters in New Hampshire. </p> <p>\"Incredibly, he now believes our national security would be stronger with Saddam Hussein in power, not in prison. </p> <p>\"He's saying he prefers the stability of a dictatorship to the hope and security of democracy. I couldn't disagree more and not so long ago so did my opponent.\" </p> <p>The exchange reflected a familiar pattern in the campaign. The White House has focused on Mr Kerry and his record. The Kerry campaign is struggling to direct attention back to the turmoil in Iraq. </p> <p>At the heart of yesterday's speech was some of the strongest language Mr Kerry has yet used, accusing the president of trying to mislead the US about its dire predicament. </p> <p>\"In Iraq this administration's record is filled with bad predictions, inaccurate cost estimates, deceptive statements and errors of judgment of historic proportions,\" he said. </p> <p>\"George Bush has not told the truth to the American people about why we went to war and how the war is going.\" </p> <p>Mr Kerry defended his Senate vote in October 2002 authorising the use of force, saying it had been meant to strengthen Mr Bush's hand in a tense diplomatic situation and was not a blank cheque. </p> <p>\"Congress was right to give the president the authority to use force to hold Saddam Hussein accountable. This president, any president, would have needed the threat of force to act effectively. This president misused that authority,\" he said. </p> <p>Michael O'Hanlon, a strate gic analyst at the Brookings Institution in Washington, said: \"I thought it was one of his stronger speeches on foreign policy. </p> <p>\"As for his proposal on going forward - as is the case for any proposal in Iraq it is unlikely to reverse the situation very quickly.\" </p> <p>The Kerry camp pointed to support for its view from a string of Republican senators at the weekend. John McCain, a former presidential contender, said Mr Bush was not being \"as straight as we would want him to be\". </p> <p>Another moderate Republican, Chuck Hagel, said: \"I don't think we're winning\", and called for \"some recalibration of policy\". </p> <p>Senator Richard Lugar said that of the more than $18bn (\u00a310bn) approved last year for rebuilding, only $1bn had been spent. </p> <p>In today's UN speech Mr Bush will point to the elections in Iraq due in January as the potential start of democratic change in the Middle East. </p> <p>He will call for more international involvement in making those polls possible, but the Kerry camp says he has alienated too many countries and offered too few incentives to others to help.</p>",
  "The wife of the Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble today confirmed she would try to unseat rival Democratic Unionist MP Jeffrey Donaldson at the next general election. <p>Daphne Trimble said she would seek her party's nomination to contest Mr Donaldson's Lagan Valley constituency. </p> <p>She said she had no fear about following her husband into Northern Ireland's bruising political arena. </p> <p>\"I do not think the DUP speaks for the people of Lagan Valley,\" she said. </p> <p>\"It is traditionally an Ulster Unionist seat and the people have always been represented by Ulster Unionists. </p> <p>\"Jeffrey's vote has always been an Ulster Unionist vote. It was Ulster Unionist voters who elected him and I think they deserve to have a representative at Westminster.\" </p> <p>Mr Donaldson defected from the UUP in January to the Reverend Ian Paisley's DUP after years of feuding with Mr Trimble over party policy. </p> <p>If chosen as a UUP candidate, Mrs Trimble will be running in the constituency where she and her husband live. </p> <p>Lagan Valley is also the neighbouring constituency to Mr Trimble's Westminster seat of Upper Bann. </p> <p>In the 2001 general election, Mr Donaldson secured 25,966 votes as a UUP candidate, the best performance of any MP in Northern Ireland. </p> <p>He had a majority of 18,342 over the cross-community Alliance party's Seamus Close and attracted more than 56.5% of the poll. </p> <p>In November's assembly election, Mr Donaldson also secured 14,104 votes in a proportional representation election, where the party's four candidates achieved a total of 19,069 votes. </p> <p>However, since defecting to the DUP, the Lagan Valley MP would hope to take most of his assembly election votes and those of his colleague Norah Beare, who also joined the Rev Paisley's party in January. </p> <p>At the last assembly election, the DUP's Edwin Poots and Basingstoke MP Andrew Hunter together polled 8,475 votes for the party. </p> <p>Mrs Trimble said today it was now up to Ulster Unionists in the constituency to decide who they wanted to contest Mr Donaldson's seat. </p> <p>\"I am putting my name forward to the party if they want to have me as their candidate,\" she said. Nominations are expected to close on October 15. </p> <p>Mrs Trimble said she was quite prepared for the rough and tumble of Northern Ireland politics, having witnessed it at close hand during her husband's career. </p> <p>At the last general election, she and her husband were jostled after he survived a recount in his Upper Bann constituency. </p> <p>She has served as a director of the Northern Ireland Memorial Fund for victims of violence and was appointed by the Northern Ireland secretary, Paul Murphy, as a member of the Equality Commission. </p> <p>Mr Donaldson said the selection of a candidate was a matter for the Ulster Unionists, but added: \"Mrs Trimble should be aware that in the assembly elections three-quarters of Ulster Unionist voters voted for anti-[Good Friday] agreement candidates and voted to reject her husband's policies. </p> <p>\"If Mrs Trimble believes there has been a resurgence of support for her husband's policies, then I think it shows just how out of touch she is with the unionist electorate. </p> <p>\"Unionists voted for change when they gave me and my colleagues the overwhelming mandate in the assembly elections.\" </p> <p>The DUP MP said voters would reject any attempt by the Ulster Unionists and Mrs Trimble to rewrite history. </p> <p>He reminded voters that the Ulster Unionists had tried to unlawfully suspend him and his colleagues from the party and had tried to expel them for refusing to support Mr Trimble's policies. </p> <p>\"People of Lagan Valley were appalled by the disgraceful manner in which I was treated by Mr Trimble and his colleagues,\" he added. </p> <p>Mr Trimble would not comment on his wife's decision to try to run for parliament.</p>",

  "<p>As is becoming traditional in European film festivals this season, American artists are taking every opportunity to criticise President Bush: this time it's Woody Allen and the occasion is the San Sebasti\u00e1n film festival. </p> <p>While in town to present new feature Melinda and Melinda and to receive a lifetime achievement award, Allen said that were Bush re-elected in November, it would be \"tragic, extremely tragic\". He added that the current White House resident may come across as a funny character but that US politics were anything but: \"If you observe [Bush], it's quite amusing. If you listen to him as he speaks, if you follow him closely, it would provide you a great many laughs. </p> <p>\"But it's the perfect example of islands of comedy, comic moments against a very, very tragic background.\" Allen's criticism comes after directors Jonathan Demme and Wim Wenders condemned the state of American politics at the Venice film festival earlier this month. </p> <p>Allen made his comments on Friday, on the opening day of a San Sebasti\u00e1n festival that has already showcased Michael Winterbottom's sexually explicit love story, Nine Songs, and the first showing of Oliver Stone's second documentary about Fidel Castro, Looking for Fidel.

  "Two-thirds of universities in England are preparing to charge students the maximum \"top-up\" fee of \u00a33,000 for all their courses, according to a Guardian survey published today which reveals deep-seated unease about the funding system being introduced in two years' time. <p>A survey of vice-chancellors shows that many will levy the full fee because they fear that they will look \"second rate\" alongside their competitors if they charge less. </p> <p>The results undermine the government's claims that allowing institutions to charge \"variable\" fees within a specified range would create a market in higher education. It also shows that two-thirds of university chiefs expect the agreed \u00a33,000 limit on top-up fees to be raised by the end of the decade, with some fearing their competitors cannot wait to raise the cap. </p> <p>Kel Fidler, vice-chancellor at Northumbria University, said: \"We're aware that many universities are champing at the bit. That worries me greatly.\" </p> <p>The exclusive survey, published today by Education Guardian, is the most comprehensive picture of vice-chancellors' plans on fees as they finalise details for the publication of their 2005-6 prospectuses, which will cover the first year of top-up fees. </p> <p>Interviews carried out with more than half the 120 univer sity vice-chancellors in England also show serious doubts that the proposed new Office for Fair Access (Offa) will help to increase university attendance from a wider range of social backgrounds. </p> <p>The findings will reignite the controversy about top-up fees - and heighten the fears of Labour backbenchers - on the eve of the Labour party conference and close to the looming general election. </p> <p>The plans are a key element of the five-year education plan published by the education secretary, Charles Clarke. The government came close to losing the higher education bill in January after a backbench rebellion, but it passed on to the statute book in July, giving universities powers to charge top-up fees of up to \u00a33,000 fromthe 2006-7 academic year. But the survey's findings provide fresh evidence that the market in higher education promised by the government - whereby students would choose courses according to their price - will fail to materialise. </p> <p>Two-thirds of vice-chancellors said that they expect to introduce the maximum \u00a33,000 across the board and only 11% said they believed they will vary the price according to the course. The rest are undecided. Of the eight who are planning to vary their fees, three are higher education colleges and the rest are former polytechnics which say they will charge lower fees mostly for sub-degree courses - foundation degrees and access courses. </p> <p>The government has promised that the \u00a33,000 cap will remain for the next parliament and until after a review of the impact of higher fees on efforts to get more people from lower social classes into universities, due in 2009. </p> <p>Even then it will need the consent of both houses of parliament to alter the arrangements. But according to the survey of 72 university and higher education chiefs, 64% believe the government will raise the cap at the earliest opportunity in 2010. A further 8% believe the government will break its promise and raise it within the next three years. </p> <p>The responses also show that many universities are developing complex bursary systems to attract students. Bursaries are one of the criteria by which the new access regulator, Offa, will judge universities' efforts to encourage more applications by students from lower income backgrounds. </p> <p>Asked what impact the new regulator will have on their ac cess policies, 61% said no effect at all. </p> <p>Half of university heads believe students will not be deterred by higher fees because they will pay them back after they graduate and the reintroduction of a modest grant will improve things. </p> <p>Kat Fletcher, president of the National Union of Students, said: \"We are not surprised that vice-chancellors expect the cap to be lifted, because without sufficient public investment in higher education, institutions can only see the income coming from students. This is a complete contradiction to the government's commitment to widening participation.\" </p> <p> Additional reporting by Tasha Kosviner and Rob Harris</p>",

He's stuck in a traffic jam on the way down from Liverpool.'\"</p> <p>The party was at pains to show its spending plans add up, says the FT's Philip Stephens. \"[Vincent] Cable, the party's able Treasury spokesman, spent much of yesterday explaining how each and every spending pledge in the manifesto had been costed against savings elsewhere or can be financed from the proposed rise to 50% in the top rate of income tax,\" he writes. \"Yet the manifesto - with its promises to abolish university tuition fees, provide free care for the elderly and replace the council tax with a local levy - is one with which many of Mr Blair's critics on the Labour left would feel comfortable.\"</p> <p>The Sun also notes that Mr Kennedy has given up alcohol and is trying to wean himself off cigarettes too. \"LEADER LOSES BOTTLE\", explains the headline.</p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Politics/libdems2004/story/0,14992,1309025,00.html\">Cable defends party's spending plans</a><br> * <a href=\"http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/politics/story.jsp?story=564025\">Independent: Our sums add up, insist Lib Dems</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2004440445,00.html\">Sun: Kennedy's potty plans</a></p> <p><b>MEGAWATI ON BRINK OF DEFEAT</b></p> <p>Megawati Sukaroputri looks certain to lose the first direct presidential elections in Indonesia.

  "<p>John Seymour, who has died aged 90, was best known as the author of The Complete Book Of Self Sufficiency, in which he advocated a lifestyle lived as close to nature as possible. First published in 1976, it became a vital resource for disillusioned city dwellers seeking a more wholesome existence in the countryside. </p> <p>In all, John produced 41 books, covering travel, rural crafts and gardening, but his abiding mission was to preach the gospel of self-sufficiency. It was a theme that came to him as a young man, when his family moved from Hampstead, north London, where he was born, to Frinton-on-Sea, Essex. There, he experienced a bygone world of farming with shire horses, and people living off the land and the sea. </p> <p>His stepfather's chewing-gum business held no interest as a career for John. Instead, he went to study agriculture at Wye College, Kent, after which, at the age of 20, he moved to South Africa, where he managed a sheep farm, worked in a copper mine and joined the government veterinary service. </p> <p>He spent much time with Bushmen, whose assured hunter-gatherer lifestyle in a semi-desert environment profoundly influenced his thinking; he said that they took from nature only as much as they needed for survival. He came to realise that much of human knowledge and culture is an ancient inheritance, and not primarily the product of urban progress. </p> <p>During the second world war, John served with the King's African Rifles, and saw service in Ethopia and Burma. After returning to England in 1945, he decided to travel overland from Europe to India, experiencing a vast variety of cultures still dominated by peasant farming. Back once again in the UK, he worked for a time on one of the last sailing barges on the east and south coasts. He learned many sailors' songs, and, later in life, loved reciting them around campfires and at rowdy parties. </p> <p>John's primary concern was that we should not readily give up a world that had been so long in the making - a world of hunter-gatherers, small-scale farmers, sailors and foresters. Should we not think twice, he would say, before we launched head-long into a plastic, fossil-fuel powered, environmentally destructive age? </p> <p>In the late 1950s, taking his wife Sally, a potter whom he had married in 1954, and their three young daughters, John moved to five acres of land near Woodbridge, in Suffolk. In BBC radio programmes, and in such books as The Fat Of The Land, he celebrated the concept of self-sufficiency, which he saw as an antidote to the emerging dependence culture that robbed people of dignity and self-respect. He wanted people to declare their independence from industrial society, emphasising that there was more to life than a 9-5 job. </p> <p>None the less, although John was not fond of urban life, some of his best friends, among them the poet William Empson, were city-dwellers, and he was thus at the heart of many a London party, and loved a lavish Chinese meal in Gerrard Street. </p> <p>His greatest success was The Complete Book Of Self-Sufficiency, which came at a time when doubts first set in about a way of life entirely dependant on fossil fuels - the 1973 oil crisis and the miner's strike. The title helped launch a new publishing phenomenon, Dorling Kindersley. The highly illustrated work sold more than a million copies in some 20 languages. Its appeal was to those who wanted to learn about such skills as growing their own vegetables and making their own cheese. </p> <p>John and his family had, by now, moved to Pembrokeshire, west Wales, and readers streamed to his farm near Newport. All were given a meal and a bed, sometimes in the hay barn. The royalties from the book were spent as quickly as they accrued - on hospitality, on rebuilding the barn after it was burned down by careless guests, and on repairing farm equipment wrecked by clumsy visitors. Yet in the middle of this turmoil, John kept on writing, producing on average two books a year on aspects of rural living. </p> <p>In the 1980s, John and I made a BBC series, Far From Paradise. This took us to many parts of the world - the ancient city of Ur and the salty wastes of Mesopotamia, the last remaining villages in Europe where people still farmed without tractors, the acid-rain damaged forests of Germany, the eroding farmlands of Kansas and the skyscrapers of Manhattan. The series was a first attempt to take stock of the ever- increasing impact of an industrialising, urbanising humanity on its host planet. </p> <p>To counter this rather depressing experience, we co-authored Blueprint For A Green Planet (1987), one of the first books emphasising the opportunities of green consumerism in countering environmental destruction. Sadly, the publishers refused to include a chapter linking personal responsibility and collective action. </p> <p>John continued to write books celebrating all aspects of rural life. For most of the last two decades, he lived in County Wexford, Ireland, and, even though age started to take its toll, he still ran courses on such topics as milking cows or curing ham. Participants signed up from all over the world. Evenings were for storytelling, playing the harmonica and singing sailors' songs - John had the extraordinary memory of a man who refused to clutter his mind with television programmes, even if he loved presenting them. </p> <p>In the last 18 months, he was back on his beloved Pembrokeshire farm with his daughter Ann, telling stories to his grandchildren and writing rhyming poetry, with an acerbic wit that was his last weapon against what he saw as our destructive era. </p> <p>John was as much at home in the humblest house on a hillside, as in the manor house of landed gentry. He was like a force of nature, always willing to listen, always interested in learning about new - or very old - ways of working the land. He was a one-man rebellion against modernism, and his absence will be felt by millions of readers the world over. </p> <p>He is survived by his wife and three daughters.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> John Seymour, author, born June 12 1914; died September 14 2004</p>",
  "<p>Billions of pounds, enough to pay for the entire primary health and education needs of the world's developing countries, are being siphoned off through offshore companies and tax havens, according to a body formed to expose the offenders. </p> <p>Aid organisations are alarmed that money which should be used for building the infrastructure of the poorest countries is being hidden in havens by corrupt politicians and multinationals exploiting tax loopholes. Offshore companies are being formed at the rate of about 150,000 a year. While in the 70s there were just 25 tax havens, there are at least 63 now, about half of them British protectorates or former colonies. Tax avoidance in Britain alone is estimated at between \u00a325bn and \u00a385bn. </p> <p>This month the Tax Justice Network, which was formed last year by tax experts and economists worried about the trend, launched an international secretariat in London. It will work with the UN and other international bodies to reverse the practice of hiding money from governments worldwide. </p> <p>John Christensen, coordinator of the secretariat, said: \"Many developing countries are now dominated by elites that are involved in tax havens. Things have actually got worse in the last few years.\" As new havens are formed, existing ones offer better deals. </p> <p>Mr Christensen, a former economic adviser to the Jersey government who has also worked at the then Department of Overseas Development and with Oxfam, said many of the havens were now \"locked in a desperate competition. They like to suggest that they oil the wheels of global capital but there is no case for that. What has happened is that tax havens transfer the burden of tax away from capital and towards labour and the consumer.\" </p> <p>He also believes that the attraction of making money by putting it in offshore havens damaged British industry because money which could have been invested in Britain had been removed from the country. </p> <p>Kofi Annan, the UN secretary general, has also expressed concern that money which should be spent on developing countries is being moved offshore. </p> <p>A UN spokesman confirmed yesterday that Mr Annan saw the issue as a priority. \"The secretary general has indicated repeatedly that he believes money should be spent on development rather than going offshore,\" he said. </p> <p>The secretariat believes the UN has a vital role to play in tracking the money. \"The remedies have to be global and the UN is the only body able to do it,\" said Mr Christensen. \"The WTO [World Trade Organisation] has failed.\" </p> <p>Tax havens have also attracted the attention of John Kerry, the US Democratic party's presidential candidate, who has indicated that if elected he will pursue the companies that hide their profits abroad. In April, the US general accounting office said 61% of US corporations paid no federal income tax in the late 90s. Tax havens contain only 1.2% of the world's population and 3% of the world's GDP, but 26% of assets and 31% of the profits of US multinationals are held there. </p> <p><strong>Global phenomena</strong></p> <p>Almost every part of the world now has access to havens. Europeans can use the old-established ones such as Jersey and Liechtenstein or the newer ones, like Cyprus and Malta; the Asian Pacific has the Pacific islands and Singapore; India and southern Africa have the Seychelles and Mauritius; and North America has the Caribbean islands and Central America. </p> <p>While a number of havens, such as the Cayman islands and Bermuda, have improved regulations, the effect of this has been, in the view of Mr Christensen, to legitimise them. \"Merely chasing out the worst havens and setting international standards for the better ones does little to address the real problems,\" he said. </p> <p>The list of political figures who have availed themselves of the system includes Haiti's \"Baby Doc\" Duvalier, Zaire's President Mobutu, Sani Abacha, the former president of Nigeria, and Raul Salinas, the brother of the former Mexican president. Mr Abacha, during his period as president, had a standing order to transfer $15m (\u00a38.4m at current exchange rates) a day of stolen funds to his Swiss bank account. Much of this money has been lost forever to the countries concerned although some has been traced; the current president of Nigeria recently visited Jersey to thank the authorities there for tracking down the millions that Mr Abacha had hidden. </p> <p>In 1999, the Economist estimated that African leaders had $20bn in Swiss bank accounts alone, twice the amount that sub-Saharan Africa spends on servicing debts. </p> <p>Among the latest countries offering such services is Somalia, which Mr Christensen describes as \"an example of what can happen when the cancer is not cut out\". He believes that the main function of the financial markets in Somalia will be money laundering. </p> <p>Tax avoidance also breeds other unethical habits: when Enron was investigated in 2001, it emerged it had 881 offshore subsidiaries, 692 incorporated in the Cayman islands. The change has been assisted by technological change in communication and the liberalisation of the marketplace. </p> <p>Many major charities are also concerned about the situation. \"The implications of tax avoidance on development are manifold,\" said Tim Peat, economic justice campaigner at War on Want. \"While transnational corporations endeavour to hold on to cash by shoring it up in tax havens, millions are lost that could have been used in the fight against poverty. </p> <p>\"Every time we investigate corruption in the oil industry, we find that looted public money has been laundered through offshore tax havens,\" said Gavin Hayman of Global Witness, the international resource watchdog group. </p> <p>\"Billions of dollars pass from public to private hands this way with no comeback. The collateral damage to the licit international system and to international development is truly enormous and the only people who benefit are those who have something bad to hide. Tax havens are the seedy backstreet bars of the financial world, where corporations and multi-millionaires huddle in shadowy corners to pursue their business out of sight of respectable citizens.\" </p> <p><strong>Instability</strong></p> <p>The latest Oxfam report on tax havens, on which Mr Christensen worked, suggested the amount secreted in tax havens was equivalent to six times the estimated annual cost of universal primary education and almost three times the cost of universal primary health. </p> <p>He said that offshore centres undermined economies in three ways: the capacity of countries to raise tax revenue was limited, thus restricting a poor country's ability to finance investments in health and education; secondly, the offshore system provided a safe haven for money laundering, illicit arms dealing and diamond trafficking; thirdly, the offshore system contributed to financial instability which led to the crises in the Indonesian and Thai economies in 90s. </p> <p>His colleague Sony Kapoor, the secretariat's economic adviser, agreed: \"Tax evasion and tax avoidance on a large scale is inhibiting development in poor countries and eroding the existing welfare state in the rich states.\" </p> <p>A variety of international organisations are now attempting to address the problem in differing ways. They include the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, the EU, the UN drugs control programme and the Financial Action Task Force, which was set up by the G7 countries. Charities and churches across Europe, particularly in France, are also becoming more involved. </p> <p>Richard Murphy, of Tax Research, which works closely with the new organisation, said it was important that the wealthier countries were seen not to be dictating terms to poorer countries. </p> <p>\"You cannot dictate to nation states their level of taxes,\" he said, \"but you can require that they only tax what is theirs to tax.\" </p> <p>The notion of tax havens goes back to just after the Napoleonic wars when demobbed officers moved to Jersey, but it was not until the 1960s that the high rates of British taxation acted as a motivation for people to move their money abroad. </p> <p>Allowing British protectorates or former colonies to set themselves up as tax havens was also an attractive proposition for Britain in that it allowed those places to become self-sufficient. Now the whole process has accelerated to the extent that billions of pounds are being removed from the very countries that need them most.</p>",
