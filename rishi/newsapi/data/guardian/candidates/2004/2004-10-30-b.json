  "<p>Legal deadlock between George Bush and John Kerry after this week's presidential poll would unleash turmoil on the US stock markets, analysts are warning. </p> <p>With armies of lawyers ready to dispute the result in closely fought states, investors fear a repeat of 2000, when the S&amp;P 500 index lost more than 5 per cent of its value between polling day and 13 December, when Al Gore finally conceded defeat. </p> <p>'Most people would prefer a result to no result, but with all these lawyers around, the potential for chaos is considerable,' said Ian Shepherdson of High Frequency Economics, a top US analyst. </p> <p>A protracted period of political uncertainty would shake the confidence of investors already fretting about rocketing oil prices and slower-than-expected growth in the world's largest economy. </p> <p>'After the long string of negative confidence blows - the stock bubble, tech wreck, 9/11, war in Iraq, oil shock, and multiple finance scandals - a second hung election in a row stands to suck a little more of the \"mojo\" out of the economy,' said Ethan Harris, chief US economist at Lehman Brothers in a research note last week. </p> <p>Confusion about who has won and a resulting downturn in markets could also throw into doubt the outcome of the Federal Reserve's crucial interest rate-setting meet ing on 10 November, when it is widely expected to raise borrowing costs. </p> <p>'The Fed might prefer to wait until December to raise rates if it felt the election uncertainty was damaging the real economy,' says Paul Ashworth, US economist at Capital Economics. </p> <p>Once a winner is declared, analysts think a Bush win would be better for the markets. 'The most positive is probably Bush, not necessarily because he's a Republican, but because the markets prefer the incumbent: better the devil you know,' says Ashworth. </p> <p>Analysis of every presiden tial election year since 1900 by Bob Doll, chief investment officer at Merrill Lynch, shows that the equity markets jumped by an average of 8.2 per cent when the incumbent won, against 3.7 per cent when there was a change of administration.</p>",
  "<p>Is former Culture Secretary Chris Smith, below, in danger of burning himself out? Two weeks ago, we called the Islington South and Finsbury MP's office to get his wisdom on the government's Gambling Bill. 'He's off walking in the Lake District.' No doubt getting to grips with his new role as president of the Ramblers' Association. Last week, repeating our request, we're told that our man is in Barcelona on British Council business and won't be back till next week. And you thought the ex-minister was quitting at the next election. </p> <p><strong>Who's where</strong></p> <p>Chris Smith working for the British Council? With Lord Kinnock about to take the reins of this august organisation, it's time to play Spot New Labour at the British Council. Look, there's the Chancellor's former press officer, the charming Helen Etheridge, handling communications. And isn't that Hannah McConnell, daughter of Scotland's first minister, Jack, helping us with our press inquiries? And I swear I can see Kinnock's son, Stephen, doing sterling work for the advocate of British culture in Brussels. And hey, there's Martin Dowell, a good pal of Peter Mandelson, helping the council to secure its government grant. And ... there's more, but we'll leave it here for now. </p> <p><strong>Ethics boys</strong></p> <p>Last Sunday, Burmese pro-democracy leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, right, began her tenth year incarcerated by the brutal Burmese military regime. Last week the European Union set out of list of sanctions covering every Burmese industry other than its money-spinners - oil, gas and timber. For this egregious dilution, blame the French. It's French oil firm Total which stands to gain from the rich reserves that will be extracted in coming years. And it's been the French who have been vetoing strong sanctions. But Britain is no angel. Soon after Labour came to power, UK imports of goods from Burma were \u00a317.3 million. By 2002, they were up to \u00a364.3m. In three years' time, the tyrannical dictators who rule Burma will be home and dry on the riches that gas and oil excavation will bring. If sanctions don't come now, it will be too late. Oh, well. Never mind. </p> <p><strong>Fairy tales</strong></p> <p>Remember that awesome Treasury-inspired idea of selling Inland Revenue and Customs &amp; Excise offices to Mapeley, a firm based in the tax haven of Bermuda? Rents across the 700-strong estate were meant to cost taxpayers \u00a3170m, but have now nearly doubled to \u00a3307m. Money well spent obviously. Especially when we are told civil servants in one office are working under fairy lights because the main ones repeatedly fail. And it took intervention by the PCS union to fix a dysfunctional fire alarm. Now that's what we call private sector efficiency. </p> <p><strong>Debt relief</strong></p> <p>Funny that John Healey, Economic Secretary to the Treasury, told a constituent by letter that Zambia would not have to privatise its state-owned bank to qualify for relief on its onerous international debt. The old dogmatic conditions no longer apply, he told the constituent. Unfortunately, it seems the reverse is true. Zambia is privatising its bank. John, can you help us out here? </p> <p><strong>Shell shock</strong></p> <p>Shell merging its Dutch and British arms and relocating its headquarters to Holland? We should have seen it coming. Months ago, members of the Shell worldwide press office in London were busy taking Dutch lessons and buying city maps. Sometimes it's the little things that give the game away.</p>",
  "<p>After a 10-week sabbatical, the Gladiator, probably injudiciously, has decided to return to the forum and pit his and the troop's wits against the political vagaries and uncertain market conditions that prevail ahead of the US presidential election on Tuesday. </p> <p>Though 'black gold' has tended to dominate investors' agenda in recent weeks, many suspect that the threat of an inconclusive result to the election potentially poses unwelcome challenges. A vision of the 'New England Beanpole' striding up the steps, four at a time, of the Supreme Court to challenge the result could do cataclysmic damage to the market place, even if only temporarily. A month ago the president was virtually a 'shoo-in'. </p> <p>However, Messrs Bush and Kerry have failed to strike a chord with the electorate over their respective economic policies. Iraq, security and their personalities seem to be the only issues under consideration. Markets have no remedy for uncertainty, but that could be what investors are faced with on Wednesday morning. </p> <p>In recent decades, shares have fared better under the Democrats, despite expectations to the contrary. But Kerry is conceivably less of a free-marketeer than Bush. So playing the foreign exchange game in giving the greenback a severe larruping could in the short-term prove to be extreme folly. </p> <p>Though GDP in the US stands at 3.7 per cent, that level is nothing to shout about. Since equities took a turn for the worse in August, they have rallied strongly in certain sectors. However, the p/e ratios for the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq stand at 19.6 and 35.77 respectively. It is taken as read that these ratios are lower than in 2000, when shares started to fall sharply. However, they are looking a little heavy and if there was political 'impasse' the troops are of the opinion that retail, apart from discount operations, and tech sectors could fall, through a steep drop in confidence. </p> <p>Consequently, the troops were sent into the ring first thing last Friday to short Target at $50.09, Federated Department Stores (Macy's &amp; Bloomingdales) at $49.90, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch at $39.58 and Tiffany at $29.25 each in \u00a320 per point. These 'shorts' were surreptitiously made on their respective 'up-ticks'. The Gladiator gave the techs a wide berth, as they seem to be under a 'wet sail' at the moment. Look at Google! Since its debut three months ago, its share price has risen from $85 to $193! Its p/e ratio is only 75 times earnings against Yahoo's 125 times, though Yahoo is growing organically at 35% per annum. </p> <p>Whichever candidate wins this 'contest'; neither will feel that he has arrived in nirvana. However, when the dust has settled, defence stocks such as Honeywell, Raytheon and Lockheed Martin will eventually thrive; Raytheon bought at $37.45 in \u00a325 a point. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Gladiator is the nom de plume of a professional spreadbetter</p>",
  "<p><strong>Whose Baby?</strong> ITV1 </p> <p><strong>The Power of Nightmares</strong> BBC2 </p> <p><strong>God Bless America: With God on our side</strong> C4 </p> <p>A couple of weeks ago I criticised Bob Geldof's pair of highly personal polemical documentaries on modern marriage and fathers' rights, or lack of them. In response I received precisely two furious emails and two more-in-sadness-than-in-anger snails. I got more angry letters when I criticised the oeuvre of Stephen Poliakoff - no 'Saint Steve', he - a few years ago; not an obviously emotive topic, much less headline-grabbing, but it had Poliakoff-loving Observer readers steaming. </p> <p>Anyway, last week's ITV1 drama <strong> Whose Baby?</strong> demonstrated that the sort of thorny social issue that strikes terror into the heart of Daily Mail readers and gives the flower of modern British masculinity sleepless nights (Aieee! Preserve us from the foxy spermhunters! ) is increasingly being packaged as light-ish entertainment. </p> <p>Here Karen (Sophie Okonedo) dates Barry (Andrew Lincoln) mostly in order to cheat him out of his sperm by artificially inseminating herself with the contents of a used condom, which is not something I would've thought was very easy, frankly - do you need to visit B&amp;Q before phoning a friend? - but we were spared the technical details. </p> <p>Having captured her prize by whatever means and done the pregnancy test, Karen dumps Barry because 'you're not my soulmate' and proceeds to go it alone with the fruit of Barry's loins, baby Lola. </p> <p>Despite being a feisty, coping sort, Karen soon finds that finances are tight and though far from keen to involve Barry, who is entirely unaware of Lola's existence, she ends up seeking maintenance via the CSA. To which Barry's response is the lousiest analogy of the week: 'It's like someone's stolen my TV and expects me to pay for the licence.' </p> <p>Written by Rosemary Kay, whose This Little Life was one of the most affecting and understated single dramas of recent years, and directed by Rebecca Frayn (daughter of Michael), Whose Baby? appeared to go to considerable lengths to make Barry evolve from an emotional lightweight to an almost compulsively committed wannabe dad, while Karen stayed exactly where she was at the beginning, Princess Pouty of Shrugville, which was a shame because a compelling actor such as Okonedo could have taken us with her wherever her character needed to go. </p> <p>The film was full of visual cliches - the harried single mother's messy council flat, for example, and a waking-up-bolt-upright-and-almost-headbutting-the-camera shot as Barry emerged from a nightmare (has anyone ever done that, even if they've just dreamt they slept with Vicky Pollard?), and it ended with a cutesy set-piece stunt, pure Cold Feet , in which Barry borrowed a hydraulic platform from his plant hire firm and dressed up as a tiger to surprise Lola, thus prov ing that parental love and borderline stalking go together like tigers and hydraulic platforms, if not love and marriage. </p> <p>'I'm a great believer in if you want something you just go out and get it,' said Karen, whose moral code could be reduced to a catchphrase: Me-First. Holding newborn Lola in her hospital bed and surrounded by friends, her later comment that 'I picked a good-looking guy, didn't I?' fell on silently disapproving ears. We were clearly not meant to approve of Karen, or Karens in general, but Barry was a different story. Barry was a hero just for daring to show he had emotions - never mind that his motivations were, in their way, just as selfish as Karen's. </p> <p> Whose Baby? was shot in widescreen Glib-o-Rama, deploying dream sequences, flashbacks and the leftover suds from a thousand soaps. It had delusions of bravery and modernity and Tell It Like It Is-ness but merely succeeded in being shallow and sentimental. Scratch the surface of its racy liberal veneer (alcohol-fuelled sex, Lincoln's lovely bottom, pretty mixed-race babies, lots of F-ing) and you found a surprisingly uptight conservative message, albeit one to gladden the heart of Bob Geldof. </p> <p>Mind you, thanks to a rash of excellent documentaries in the run-up to the Most Vitally Important American Election Ever (TM), I am currently spotting neocon plots around every corner, or at least every corner which hasn't already been bagged by the Muslim fundamentalist jihadists. Never mind that our own bunch of pansy neocons have been completely out-conned by neo-Lab. </p> <p>And if we heed the message of Adam Curtis's unmissable trio of BBC2 documentaries on the rise of the politics of fear, <strong> The Power of Nightmares</strong> , these forces for 'good' and 'evil' (whichever: you pays your money_) cannot really survive without the other to demonise. But, if we're really lucky, they may also end up cancelling each other out, blowing each other up or jumping off the same metaphorical cliff simultaneously, while obviously taking a lot of the rest of us with them on the way - the point is, 'They' do the politics while we're busy buying into the fear. </p> <p>The films sweep you away with their seductiveness and persuasiveness; they're beautifully directed, deftly edited, full of cleverly researched talking heads and archive footage (here was Brent Scowcroft, Bush Sr's national security adviser, filmed in 1996: 'It was never our objective to get Saddam Hussein. Indeed, had we tried we still might be occupying Baghdad, and that would have turned a great success into a very messy probable defeat_'). </p> <p>All in all, this is instant documentary gratification. And yet, after the event, these films are also capable of leaving one oddly emotionally deflated. Eventually, despite having been utterly seduced while on the journey, you'd be a fool not to accept that it's easy to create a smart thesis around the high drama of current world events, but the 'politics of fear' may have arisen more by a series of random accidents than as a result of any political architect's grand design. It's all a little too perfect and cleverly conspiratorial. </p> <p>Until, that is, the documentary evidence starts to mount. Last night's excellent <strong> God Bless America: With God On Our Side</strong> , part of Channel 4's The Greatest Democracy on Earth season, was a two-hour potted his tory of the rise of the evangelical Christian right (and C4 is really on to something by making Saturdays stay-in-and-think night), all the way from the boyish black-and-white Billy Graham of the 1950s, to the middle-aged Graham of the Nixon years to the avuncular statesmanlike Graham of the Bush era, via a heavenly hair-dyed host of other US televangelists. </p> <p>This was effectively the story of how the President of the US has, to a greater or lesser degree, gotta get a God if they want to get ahead. More than 40 per cent of the US electorate now claims to have been born again, as compared to 26 per cent during the mid-1970s, when Jimmy Carter's statement that 'the most important thing in my life is Jesus Christ' had sent the mainstream media into a tailspin: what exactly was this backwoodsy Southern Baptist evangelical schtick? </p> <p>Since then, every president has played the game by fusing faith with ambition, and obviously none more so than the present incumbent, of whom old Bush family friend Billy Graham has remarked 'I don't endorse candidates, but I've come as close to it as at any time in my life_', conveniently overlooking a previous intimate dalliance with Nixon. </p> <p>While the Christian right looks on Dubya as the prodigal son, interestingly it is Bush Sr who, retrospectively, comes across as the closest thing to a heathen to have set foot in the White House in 40-odd years (aside, obviously, from the sinner Clinton). Perhaps just a bit too posh to be comfortable with the grassroots evangelicals, he managed to anger and confuse them by remaining pro-choice and inviting gay and lesbian groups to the White House for the first time. </p> <p>This unacceptably woolly liberal take on Republicanism saw a groundswell among the powerful Christian Coalitionists and - high-fiving in the aisles when they found out about Monica - saw its natural conclusion in a witch-hunt against his successor and the alleged moral threat he posed. </p> <p>That they failed to ignite a moral rocket under the complacent collective ass of middle America (taxes nice and low, jobs safe, who cares if the Prez is getting a bit on the side?) matters not because in Dubya they have their man and, in the futile War Against Terror, they not only get to feel big and brave and righteous but kick towelhead ass, too. </p> <p>I guess miracles can happen (and Yasser Arafat might live until he's 103) but given that, as one contributor observed, 'in America, if you are married, have kids and go to church, you're a Republican', it's highly likely that by Wednesday morning (and after both candidates have spent $1.5 billion on the presidential race - the last British election cost \u00a339 million), they'll have their Clown Prince of Darkness right where they want him for another four years. All together now, dah, dah, dah-dah_ Hail to the Cheat.</p>",
  "<p>American etiquette rule No 1: try not to insult government ministers in public. It's March 2002 and Aaron McGruder, the creator of radical cartoon strip The Boondocks and ascendant African-American media firebrand, is accepting the Chairman's Award at the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) Image Awards.</p> <p>One small problem: he's been seated in the front row of the auditorium, near Condoleezza Rice. In his acceptance speech, he makes brief reference to this irony, denounces America's recent invasion of Afghanistan, then leaves the podium in relatively compliant style.</p> <p>Minutes later, he's mingling, when he feels a hand on his shoulder. He finds himself face-to-face with America's national security adviser. McGruder has never divulged full details of his conversation with Rice, except for the fact that he called her a mass-murderer ('in a clever way') and that she requested he write her into The Boondocks. </p> <p>McGruder insists the Rice fracas has become a millstone. He's holding back a full disclosure of the exchange for an autobiographical book, but he insists: 'Because everyone asks me about it and I never tell, it's going to be so uninteresting when I actually tell the story.' But he got back to Rice on her request in October 2003, suggesting that as a 'female Darth Vader' she might be less bent on destroying the world if she had a man in her life to give her 'some good old-fashioned lovin\". The Washington Post pulled the strip for a week; just another ban in the life of The Boondocks.</p> <p>Huey Freeman, the 10-year-old Don King-coiffed star of The Boondocks, stares out over Aaron McGruder's penthouse from a huge framed cover of liberal political weekly The Nation on the wall. His 30-year-old creator, diminutive, goateed and handsome, sits beneath him on a voluminous brown couch, where all the work on the strip takes place. We're on Beverly Hills' borders, just north of LA's vast Four Seasons hotel; McGruder tells how, a few nights ago, two police helicopters were hovering in the zone between the hotel and his apartment building, waiting to swoop on the city's latest outbreak of evil-doing.</p> <p>'I think something like 70 per cent of the jail population in America is non-violent drug offenders. So you know, we're still living in the era of prohibition,' he reflects. With his hair clipped much shorter than in the dust-jacket photo on the back of his latest Boondocks compendium, A Right To Be Hostile, McGruder no longer shares the topiary with Huey, but there's no mistaking where his schoolyard alter ego gets his politics from. On his beat around the middle-class suburb of Woodcrest where he lives with his grandad, Huey is perpetually pissed off with the status quo, whether it's Bush's stem-cell research policy or P Diddy's hip-hop clownery.</p> <p>On the September afternoon we meet, the latest batch of The Boondocks, syndicated to nearly 300 newspapers in the US, is giving McGruder a serious headache. Even with coy asterisks, several papers are objecting to his latest story line, 'Can a n**** get a job?', a spoof of Donald Trump's NBC show The Apprentice. McGruder balks at any changes. 'The strip's very personal to me - I don't wanna engage in dialogue about it.'</p> <p>Wednesday is supposedly his day off from the strip, but he's busy finalising details for the Boondocks TV show, which is about to go into a 62-week production schedule for its first series. Currently, he's testing voice actors for Huey - he's thinking of going with a girl, a la Bart Simpson. Among the names on the casting list are Fresh Prince of Bel Air starlet Tatyana Ali and fem-rapper MC Lyte.</p> <p>McGruder started drawing The Boondocks while studying African-American studies at the University of Maryland, grounding it in a combination of radical black politics and pop-culture roughage. He decided to use kids in the strip (Huey has an eight-year-old brother, wannabe gangster Riley) to 'seduce the audience' - Charles Schultz by way of Nation of Islam. 'You're taking someone [people] would maybe otherwise find unpleasant and making it pleasant to look at. And instantly, psychologically, the impact it has is tremendous.'</p> <p>With an anti-authoritarian instinct that later made him notorious, Jayson Blair (of the New York Times fabrication scandal), then editor of college paper The Diamondback, began running the strip in late 1996. Two years later, McGruder signed up with Universal Press Syndicate, which also published Doonesbury, and The Boondocks began running immediately in 160 papers - a large launch - and grew from there.</p> <p>The early days of the strip were 'very, very tough'. Compared to The Boondocks of 2004, which often features near-static panels of Huey slackly commenting on television, he was more ambitious. Plotlines were carefully interlacing and other characters featured more often: Huey and Riley's cantankerous grandad; Caesar, a dreadlocked schoolmate from Brooklyn; Tom Dubois, a cosy African-American lawyer whom Huey needed to periodically remind about Black Power; Tom's racially mixed daughter Jazmine, a bit stuck on the young revolutionary. </p> <p>The latter two have been all but erased from the strip now, but McGruder reckons they were a necessary sacrifice. Bad at meeting deadlines anyway, he found the Sisyphean nature of his labours dragging him under. 'If I had known how hard it was going to be, I may have thought twice before doing it ... Bringing the characters to life and exploring their personalities is tough to do in just two or three panels.' By 2000, he couldn't eat or sleep properly and was once hospitalised with acute gastrointestinal pains. It's obvious, looking at the increasingly self-referential strips from the period, that creative entropy had set in. Huey was fretting over filling his own bolshy newsletter, The Free Huey World Report, and handing over the logo for his impending insurrection, he moaned: 'I don't know why I gotta lead the revolution and illustrate it.' </p> <p>McGruder himself has ended up farming out the inking, but it was September 11 that really changed the strip. The attack fell on a Tuesday, his deadline day, giving him a week to decide whether he was going to touch the subject. Even hitting the national stage on the 25th with an initial swipe at glassy-eyed media patriotism, he was the first (Doonesbury followed later). 'I think this is where it helps to be a black American,' he says, \"cause I think for the most part as an ethnic group we are so much more suspicious of the government in general. I was never one of those people who thought this was the time to rally round the flag and support Bush. Because if he was an idiot on September 10, he was still an idiot on September 12.'</p> <p>McGruder's deadline problems disappeared and the strip, a previously loose sense of scorn, catalysed into a focused beam of outrage. It was too much for some: the New York Daily News banned The Boondocks for several weeks. As public criticism of the strip mounted, he fired back sarcastically, 'censoring' Huey and fellow conspirators for four days and replacing them with 'The Adventures of Flagee and Ribbon', a talking Stars and Stripes and a patriotic ribbon. McGruder suddenly found himself increasingly in demand on radio and TV as house iconoclast (as well as the subject of the odd flattering death threat - one was once phoned in at a restaurant he was eating in). 'What happened after 9/11, I think, was actually a very, very good thing in that I took on a greater importance, not only in the comics business, but also in the national dialogue about politics in general. Because nobody else wanted to criticise the government.' The Boondocks may have had to downsize, but its creator was on the up. Another flashpoint came last December, when McGruder let slip the n-word at a birthday dinner for The Nation at New York's Metropolitan Club. Dinner ($500 a head) over, and Uma Thurman stepped up to introduce the cartoonist. </p> <p>The assembled luminaries must have known about McGruder's Molotov reputation, but it's unlikely they anticipated that he would turn his scorched-earth policy on them - at their own dinner. He rubbished The Nation's liberalism, scoffing at its so-called 'courage' and accusing it of letting Bush and his administration go unchecked. Then came the clincher: he told diners he had voted for Ralph Nader in 2000. A Nation staff member shouted out, 'Thanks for Bush!' McGruder's response was to move his hand crotchwards and suggest that the journalist 'Try these nuts.'</p> <p>He disputes this account. 'I said the word \"Nader\". And that's all - that was it. My attitude is: we're sitting here at a really nice party, we're celebrating, but there's nothing to celebrate. We're getting our asses panned by George and we're sitting here drinking up.'</p> <p>He's intensely politicised, but it's 'a common-sense thing, being able to see when people are obviously lying', rather than any kind of Trotskyite upbringing. He was born on Chicago's South Side and, with his parents and older brother Dedric (also a part-time political cartoonist), moved to Columbia, Maryland, at the age of six. </p> <p>The Boondocks begins when the Freeman brothers make a similar move to the middle-class 'burb of Woodcrest. Apart from the liberal coasts, it's perhaps somewhere in this anonymous section of America's consciousness that McGruder finds his audience. 'I think it reaches a very sort of, er, large, quiet minority of people who understand the strip's sensibilities. Not the cross-section of people who live on television ... I think it's a lot of people who are quietly outraged at what's going on in the country, but who have no means to make their voice heard and have given up on the political system.'</p> <p>McGruder's attitude towards Bush and his government has been caustic since The Boondocks started, and the administration comes in for a roasting in another of his projects, the graphic novel Birth of a Nation. Co-written with House Party creator Reggie Hudlin, it's based on the Florida fiasco in 2000; after an impoverished black area in St Louis is gratuitously disenfranchised, it decides to secede from the Union. East St Louis becomes Blackland and lets Prince audition to write the national anthem, while scantily veiled versions of Bush and Cheney flap about how to rein in the recalcitrant state.</p> <p>He's currently laying into all-comers in the run-up to the 2004 election: Huey has been on the phone to John Kerry, marvelling at his incompetence; agog at Bush's stem-cell research phobia; and had Tom Dubois kidnap Democrat-wrecker Nader (McGruder is voting Democrat this time). 'I don't look at the strip as a tool for political change,' he says. 'I don't think it has that kind of power. It is just me telling jokes that I think are funny.'</p> <p>He's a friend of Michael Moore, who wrote the foreword to A Right To Be Hostile, praising The Boondocks as 'the most truthful thing in the newspapers'. McGruder cites Fahrenheit 9/11's $120m take as one of the few things in American political and cultural life that give him hope. But, he says, he'd be cautious about wielding the same level of influence as Moore. 'It comes with having to fear for your life ... He has to be concerned. Not even so much about the government as random weirdos and crazy people.'</p> <p>America has acquired a coterie of comic dissenters, including Moore; Garry Trudeau, whose Doonesbury enjoyed its own period of exile from 38 US newspapers in July; and David Rees, responsible for the excellently profane Get Your War On, co-opted by Rolling Stone - and McGruder is high among their ranks. He's unsure, though, whether Bush has been the gift to US satirists you'd expect. 'It's a big problem, because Bush is so stupid and has not changed or grown or matured at all in the last four years. And there's only so many times you can tell the same joke, y'know. But yet, he just stays stupid.' </p> <p>But behind this comment, you get the impression that the old boredom that stymied The Boondocks after the last election might be waiting to strike again and, still straitjacketed into three-panel 'comic claustrophobia', McGruder is still searching for the right outlet.</p> <p>'Man, that was boring.' McGruder is talking about a gruelling lunch with Fidel Castro on a trip he made to Cuba with a relief organisation. He's full of admiration for what Castro has achieved, flinging statistics around with professorial earnestness, about the education system and infant-mortality rates. But still, 'It was a one-hour talk stretched into, like, four hours.'</p> <p>Maybe McGruder needs to condense his efforts, too. The Boondocks, by his own admission in the foreword to A Right To Be Hostile, only splutters into clear-throated articulacy from time to time. Hemmed in by twentysomething detritus - Run DMC dolls, piles of comics, a pair of light-sabres, Clinton's biography, a photo of McGruder's Filipino girlfriend of three years, a portrait of the cartoonist by the late Richard Avedon, amid wooden African masks and arboreal potted plants - there's a sense of a certain restless creative promiscuity. As well as daily Boondocks duty and his non-fiction book, he's working on two screenplays: one about an African-American pilot drafted into an RAF kamikaze squad in the Second World War, another about a fictional beef, cooked up by two rival rappers, which gets out of hand.</p> <p>But the big hope, of course, is The Boondocks TV show. McGruder holds up The Simpsons as the obvious example of a show that 'works in a lot of politics without talking about the news'. To this end, as well as allowing him to break through the limitations of the daily strip, he's going to restore all the faces from the early days, as well as introduce newcomers to the neighbourhood. He's currently working on getting a 'very well-known' person to play himself.</p> <p>The Simpsons' network, Fox, actually passed on The Boondocks, due, McGruder says, to financial issues rather than any fear he might hack off the hand that feeds him. With the pilot episode completed in Korea and production under way, The Boondocks will now be the flagship show on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim strand.</p> <p>Only just 30, McGruder seems very much the Hollywood player now - even a celebrity. His idealism is long established, but you get the impression that the muscles he has built most assiduously since moving to LA five years ago are his corporate-diplomatic biceps. As we decamp to a cafe for lunch, he talks over a chicken burger about how much he likes giving lectures, even though he's a shy person. He always improvises his talks, he says, and enjoys the ability to control people's emotions. One favourite rhetorical tool of his is to lie to the audience at some point and own up later, because, pace 9/11 and Iraq, 'that's what the authorities do'. Plus, 'a little bit of notoriety' has its own benefits. He performs a cheeky calculation: if 500 people attend a lecture and half are girls, say 1 per cent will be good looking, then chances are if those two girls are prepared to wait half an hour in a queue to let you sign their Boondocks book, then they'll probably want to sleep with you. </p> <p>Strategy is what most progressives need, McGruder insists. With the Democrats equally caressed by the tendrils of big business, the radical fringe 'never figured out what to do when the devil was the only person in the room left to negotiate with. They just didn't know what to do.' He refuses to go down the same path. 'I don't see myself as any kind of political activist, mostly because I think what I do in the strip is more effective than anything I could do as an activist. I'll reach a lot more people than if I'm out there in the streets, marching with a sign or something, protesting. I've got other avenues to express myself.'</p> <p>I ask him if his brand of radicalism (and, with Boondocks merchandising on the way, a brand is what it will be) is in danger of becoming just another commodity for sale. He admits that, 'Money has to be your focus, because money is the focus of everyone you're in business with.' An ultra-bright, blinding admission of how traditional left/right polarities are meaningless in an era when bottom-line merchant Harvey Weinstein whips up a 'coalition of the willing' to distribute Fahrenheit 9/11, after Disney bottled it, and Nike-wearing twentysomethings go to see documentaries like the forthcoming (and very good) The Corporation for their anti-corporate lifestyle tonic.</p> <p>McGruder knows that with The Washington Post publishing his strip, Random House his books and Cartoon Network his TV show, he's as complicit as anyone. And he's getting rich without qualms. 'I always wanted to get rich. I wanna live very, very well. The world sucks when you're poor. It's fucking deplorable. But I don't think it means you have to be part of the fucked-up system of oppressors and leaders just by virtue of making a lot of money.'</p> <p>Can he stay principled? He's already turned down offers to rope Huey and co into commercials. 'I don't spend a lot of time moaning about what I can't get away with, because there's always other media. Rather than trying to be so radical, you just put yourself out of the game. Find the smart way to make the most out of these mass-media outlets. It still requires courage and it still requires pissing people off. You just have to know how to walk the tightrope ... If you're not disciplined, it can be dangerous. You're literally dancing with the devil.'</p> <p>McGruder takes a phone call from his assistant Shawn, fleshing out more details about the casting for take-no-prisoners grade-school guerrilla Huey. Then a burst of mild flirtation with the busty, synthetic-faced Beverly Hills waitress, and we leave. Rebel with a stencil or media Faustus?

  "She is known, in more ways than one, as the model Tory wife: the beautiful former Sixties mannequin and loyal consort. But today Sandra Howard reveals a hankering for a different life, admitting that she admires Cherie Blair for keeping her high-powered career - and wishes she had persisted with university. <p>Recalling how she abandoned her convent school at 17 after being accepted by a modelling agency, the Conservative leader's wife says she wishes her parents had made her stay on: 'One of the nuns was extremely keen for me to go to Oxford. It would have been good for me. I still feel I've got an untrained mind. </p> <p>'I think they had a responsibility to push me, and you'd think, with my mother being a real bluestocking...' </p> <p>In an intriguing interview in the Times Magazine yesterday, Mrs Howard also admits to being 'a bit' to the left of her husband, and hints she might not always have been a true-blue voter. Asked if she had ever strayed during the Swinging Sixties, Mrs Howard said she had always been a Tory, before adding: 'I'm trying to remember whether I once voted some other way, but I'm not going to tell you anyway.' </p> <p>But it is her wistful comments about her lack of education that are most striking. Asked about Mrs Blair, Mrs Howard said: 'I cannot take my hat off to her enough. To have kept her job going, she's very brave, and to have a baby in office... it's marvellous for the future, for the spouse of any leader.' </p> <p>She added that she envied the life of her twentysomething daughter Larissa, who works in advertising and lives in Tokyo: 'She has that lovely independence and sees life as having her own space, and I never thought like that.' </p> <p>Her looks have been the subject of much media interest. She admits, at the age of 64, that she would resort to Botox or cosmetic surgery if only she wasn't frightened of being 'picked over' by the press, and is taking HRT, which she considers to be 'brilliant'. </p> <p>But her friends have long argued that Sandra Howard is more than just a pretty face. </p> <p>She describes in the interview how she had dinner with President Kennedy on the eve of the Cuban missile crisis, while staying with the British Ambassador to Washington, a family friend, although she insists it was a 'frivolous, pointless' conversation: 'He was flirting and talking and doing all the things he was famous for.' </p> <p>After a successful career as a model, Mrs Howard has now written a novel and works for the drugs charity Addaction. She is also credited with influencing her husband's political career: aides say the personal passages in Howard's last conference speech, in which he described his childhood, were encouraged by Sandra pushing him to reveal his softer side. </p> <p>Describing the Sixties as a 'creative time' in which parents 'brought [their children] up to be less prejudiced', Mrs Howard admits her views are slightly left of her husband's, 'but not to the point where we could ever be in different parties. And he is not to the right as much as he is thought to be. I couldn't be married to him if he were. He is a lot more soft-centred than people think.' </p> <p>The woman who admits to constantly worrying about putting her foot in it may be anxious about how such comments are interpreted. But Tory aides privately regard Sandra Howard as an asset and she is expected to take a higher-profile role in the election campaign than her two most recent predecessors, Betsey Duncan Smith and Ffion Hague, did.</p>",
  "<p>When Eliot Spitzer became New York's attorney-general six years ago, few expected much of him or from the office he won control of only after a Florida-style recount and expenditure of a good deal of his father's money. </p> <p>Nowadays, nobody is in doubt what the 45-year-old prosecutor stands for. With swagger and arrogance, he has single-handedly taken the good fight to Wall Street - and won. Almost every week he starts another high-profile fight with yet another industry; where federal regulatory bodies such as the SEC slumber, Spitzer crusades. </p> <p>His targets have included everyone from securities analysts and investment bankers to the $7.5 trillion mutual fund industry, polluting power plants and supermarket chains that underpaid delivery workers. Earlier this year, he tangled with former New York Stock Exchange chief Richard Grasso over his $200 million 'golden parachute' and in June took aim at GlaxoSmithKline, saying it withheld safety data on its anti-depressant for children. </p> <p>Last month he clashed with Marsh &amp; McLennan, America's largest insurance firm, threatened to investigate the music industry for the decades-old practice of payola, and won a pay rise for the toilet attendants at New York's fanciest restaurants. </p> <p>Like many New York prosecutors before him (including a certain Rudy Giuliani), he had made a name for himself prosecuting Mafia dons. But by the early Nineties, Mafiosi were comparatively soft targets - good for crime-fighting publicity, but more of a nuisance than a worthy adversary for a young man whose jaw, the New York Times wrote, 'actually juts'. </p> <p>But Spitzer's technique is not to put the cuffs on executives, but to threaten their firms with financial ruin. His forebears, such as Giuliani, liked to try cases; Spitzer likes to settle. Indeed, such is his reputation that the announcement of a Spitzer investigation is an excuse to sell and an invitation for shareholder lawsuits and proxy campaigns. </p> <p>During last year's mutual fund scandal he said he was not shy of imposing the 'death penalty' - bringing charges even if it meant driving them out of business. 'Where there's recidivism, whether it's a robbery or a street crime, there will be no second chance,' Spitzer said. 'That may mean the death penalty for them. In my view that's the only option we are now left with.' </p> <p>As a result, firms almost invariably agree to punishment, remedy, and structural change rather than suffer the consequences. In the case of the recent insurance fraud investigation, the stocks of the biggest players implicated, Marsh &amp; McLennan and AIG, have lost a combined $38 billion in market capitalisation since the investigation was announced on 14 October. </p> <p>Indeed, it's come to the point that firms would rather settle than be probed, let alone prosecuted. Marsh &amp; McLen nan is a case in point. When Spitzer asked the firm about its practice of receiving 'contingent commissions' from insurance companies, Marsh apparently denied the practice (Spitzer called the fees 'kickbacks') and, according to the attorney-general, 'fed us the same foolishness they've been feeding the public over the years'. </p> <p>According to Spitzer, roughly $800m of the $1.5bn in net income Marsh earned last year came from those commissions. Alleged wrongdoing is one thing, but stonewalling Spitzer is another. He vowed he would not negotiate with the existing management and last week forced the resignation of Marsh CEO Jeffrey Greenberg, son of Hank Greenberg, the legendary boss of insurance giant American International Group (AIG). </p> <p>Along with a rumoured $500m settlement (Spitzer's office says it will be far higher), Spitzer has effectively replaced Greenberg with one of his own - Michael Cherkasky, head of Kroll, Marsh's corporate security and investigations unit, and formerly Spitzer's boss at the Manhattan district attorney's office. </p> <p>Though few will say it for fear of becoming a target, there is growing criticism that Spitzer is using his power to prosecute corporate malfeasance to further his political ambitions. If true, he would not be the first. From Theodore Roosevelt, who served as New York City police commissioner, to Giuliani, who used his crime-fighting credentials to win the New York City mayoral race, and presidential contender John Kerry, being a prosecutor is a way up the ladder. </p> <p>For all the attention he enjoys (he was Time ' s Crusader of the Year in 2002, and was among New York magazine's '50 Sexiest New Yorkers') there is broader criticism that he abuses his prosecutorial tools. And he has clearly rubbed up people with powerful friends in Washington the wrong way. </p> <p>Last year, he won a ruling that forced the Bush Administration to reverse its rollback of pollution regulations that applied to big utilities. The White House has urged Spitzer to be more supportive of American industry, saying his efforts - particularly over pollution - are counter-productive. But Spitzer says he took on the issue for the same reasons he took on Wall Street - because government wasn't doing it. 'They've tried to handcuff us.' </p> <p>But it looks as if one man is ready to fight back - former NYSE chief Richard Grasso. Spitzer wants Grasso to return $140m in compensation he received when he left the stock exchange; Grasso, with only his personal fortune to protect, accuses Spitzer of getting involved for personal gain, saying it's 'clear that Mr Spitzer is running for governor in 2006 and running hard'. </p> <p>Spitzer is unrepentant: 'I like it when people push back. It's what I would do.' </p> <p>But the Grasso compensation dispute speaks to a larger issue - that of executive compensation and the question of how much a CEO is worth. In other words, Spitzer is taking on the incestuous, clubby world of compensation committees that reward themselves and each other and keep driving chief executive pay higher. 'The nature of CEO compensation is something that deserves additional scrutiny,' he says. 'One of the things that will emerge from the Grasso investigation is the failure of compensation committees to fulfil their obligations.' </p> <p>Of all Spitzer's crusades, the Grasso case may be the one to make his peers on Wall Street most uncomfortable because he is, after all, one of them: a well-educated, well-connected, monied New Yorker. His father made a fortune in property. As a midfield football player at school, his job was to nobble the competition's star player ('He was kind of our secret weapon,' recalls team mate Calvin McGee. 'Very intense on the field - a tough guy to get around'). </p> <p>He attended Princeton and Harvard Law School, where he was an editor of the Harvard Law Review . He worked as a junior clerk, then for the Manhattan District Attorney. In 1994, as a first-time candidate, he ran a disappointing fourth (out of four) for attorney- general. He ran again in 1998 and won. </p> <p>As is often pointed out, he knows who he's prosecuting because he's always known them. 'If he is waging class warfare,' notes commentator Daniel Gross, 'it's against his own class.' </p> <p>Where Spitzer will venture next is anyone's guess. There's plenty of corporate malfeasance, personal greed and social inequity in New York, let alone America, left to prosecute. </p> <p>He doesn't like to compare himself to Roosevelt or even Giuliani. 'But,' he said, 'you look at someone who played a role you'd like to emulate and look at the ideology they brought to government and say, yes, they understood what to do.' </p> <p>And he has made it clear he's not leaving soon. He's acknowledged that he is thinking about running for governor and the allure of a slower life. But, he says: 'I can't see getting out of the fray.' </p> <p><strong>Profile</strong></p> <p><strong> Name </strong> Eliot Spitzer </p> <p><strong> Age </strong> 45 </p> <p><strong> Job </strong> Became New York's 63rd attorney-general in January 1999</p> <p><strong>Major achievements </strong> Taking on securities analysts, investment bankers, mutual fund managers and insurance brokers, and improving environmental standards</p> <p><strong>Education</strong> Princeton University and Harvard Law School </p> <p><strong> Family </strong> Lives with wife, Silda, in Manhattan with their three daughters.

  "With her 'Anyone But Bush' badge pinned firmly to her jumper, the young aide chatting indignantly about hanging chads over lunch in the Commons could be mistaken for a New Labour footsoldier. <p>But she is a Tory, and the craze for anti-Republican memorabilia sweeping Conservative circles is a sign of the way the US presidential race has turned British politics upside down. As all three parties try to gauge which way the wind is blowing, young Tories may be flirting with Kerry but Labour is struggling to put a brave face on the prospect of four more years of Bush's war on terror. </p> <p>One minister accuses the Democrats of an 'emotional spasm' of anti-Bushism. 'The great imponderable is what is a \"Bush Two\" presidency like?' he said. </p> <p>'He doesn't have to get re-elected; he has got his place in history; he's won a second election which his dad didn't do. He can start to really move,' he said. </p> <p>Such views will infuriate Labour MPs praying for a Kerry victory. Peter Hain, the Leader of the Commons, and Gordon Brown have forged links with the Democrats. </p> <p>However, the minister said the left's expectations were far beyond what a Democrat presidency would deliver: 'He'd have to show he's as tough a commander-in-chief as Bush was, so he's not going to blink on Iraq. He'd have swept up an awful lot of the Jewish pro-Israel vote, so he's not going to be able to deliver on putting pressure on [Israeli PM Ariel] Sharon.' </p> <p>Diplomats here know a President Kerry would be no more likely than Bush to sign up to the Kyoto treaty, submit to the International Criminal Court or shut down Guant\u00e1namo Bay, but most expect him to finesse disagreements with Europe more sensitively. And he is not so loathed by British voters that Blair's ratings plunge after appearing with him. Sunder Katwala, general secretary of the Labour grassroots thinktank, the Fabian Society, said the left should be realistic about what concessions Kerry would want from Europe to deliver the more consensual foreign policy the left wants. </p> <p>'We're all sitting about saying \"wouldn't it be exciting if John Kerry won, what would Kerry do for us?\" Actually he would have done quite enough for us by not being George Bush,' he said. </p> <p>A Kerry presidency could bring small but important changes appealing to British public opinion: concessions on climate change, funding for birth control and sexual health programmes in developing countries and a less hostile approach to the EU. </p> <p>The Blair government has hoped for the best but planned for the worst. </p> <p>'My heart says Kerry to win, but my head says Bush,' says one minister. Another suggests this may be Kerry's equivalent of Britain's 1992 campaign, with voters angry but still unwilling to take a risk on a new leader. </p> <p>A re-elected Bush would certainly have a mandate for pre-emptive military action across the world - and would probably have lost his most doveish influence, Colin Powell, Foreign Secretary Jack Straw's best ally, who is unlikely to serve again. </p> <p>But Blair hinted that a re-elected Bush would restart the Middle East peace process. </p> <p>There is surprisingly little difference between Kerry and Bush on the most difficult issue facing the coalition: Iran's nuclear ambitions. </p> <p>Downing Street's nightmare is having to condone US-endorsed military strikes on Iranian plants. </p> <p>Nor would there be much change on Iraq under Kerry, although his rhetoric would be different. The controversial offensive on Falluja would be already under way and his plan to demand troops from France, Germany and Spain would probably be rejected, leaving Britain and the US still shouldering the military burden.</p>",
  "<p>For John Kerry it looks like being close, but no cigar. The presidential challenger is threatening a photo finish that looked well beyond his electoral powers only a few weeks ago. But this is a binary bet and there will be no spoils for a nearly man. There is sufficient uncertainty approaching Tuesday's finish line, however, for financial markets to be in a highly febrile state. </p> <p>As election day has drawn nearer, and the two candidates have drawn together in the opinion polls, so the US dollar has renewed the slide that had been on hold for the past six months. Other factors have been at work, it is true - notably the strength of the oil price - but it is hard to escape the conclusion that President Bush's increasingly sweaty-palmed hold on power has been a critical factor. </p> <p>I recently wrote in this column, while prematurely burying Senator Kerry's chances, that it was the economy that would determine the outcome of the election; and that Kerry had conspicuously failed to land a meaningful blow on this pretty static target. </p> <p>The senator's showing in the three live television face-offs with the president is being cited as the trigger for his late spurt. These were heavy on Iraq and attendant trust issues, and light on the economy. If Kerry falls just short of the line, he really might regret his neglect of the prosperity issue. </p> <p>Most financial markets will take their lead from the American currency in the immediate aftermath of the election. The greenback's fall over the past couple of weeks could be viewed as a sign of concern among traders at the prospect of a Democratic president, or at the increased chances of an ambiguous outcome, as occurred in 2000. </p> <p>In response to my attempts a few weeks ago to demystify the day-to-day movements in share prices, one reader has asked for a similar explanation of the foreign exchange markets. In particular, she asked whether the factors that drove share prices - supply and demand driven by profit prospects, management quality and the like - had parallels in currency movements. The simple answer is that indeed they do. </p> <p><strong> Basic laws</strong><br> </p> <p> Think of George Bush as chief executive of the world's largest industrial conglomerate and the rest of the world as potential consumers of its product, suppliers of raw materials to its production processes, and financiers of its activities. </p> <p>The movement of goods and services into USA Inc creates an excess supply of dollars in the market as products supplied from overseas need to be paid for in their local currencies. Conversely, any of USA Inc's output sold abroad creates excess demand for dollars as consumers of the goods need to pay for them in this currency. Any imbalance between the flow of goods in and the flow out will push the dollar down or up according to the basic laws of supply and demand. </p> <p>The third element in this equation is that of financing the great industrial venture. Investment projects are not always self-funding. Indeed the grander the project, the more likely the need for external finance. When USA Inc is expanding, it is likely to require capital from abroad to oil the wheels of its ambitions. So companies issue shares and the state issues bonds. If these are attractive enough to foreigners, their demand for them will create demand for the dollars necessary to buy them. </p> <p>In this way, USA Inc has managed, through its lengthy expansion phase, to balance the currency books. It has sucked in more goods and services from overseas than it has managed to sell products to foreigners. But the imbalance of trade this has created has been countered by the overseas appetite for American shares and government bonds. </p> <p><strong> Rationalised</strong><br> </p> <p> Which is where President Bush's role as chief executive of the enterprise is critical. Not because he is an economic wizard - he has a seasoned chief financial officer in the form of Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan - but because he is a predictable quantity. Like all Identikit CEOs, he talks up his company's prospects through thick and thin, he's prepared to push thorough controversial measures for the sake of his overall enterprise and every action he takes can be rationalised in the context of his company's public mission statement. </p> <p>Suppliers, customers and financiers need not like or agree with that mission statement to want to do business with or finance USA Inc. But they are happy to know where they stand. If the CEO fends off his challenger this week, there will undoubtedly be a relief bounce in the dollar because it will be business as usual. </p> <p>A Kerry win, however, would mean a new mission statement for USA Inc - one that would not appear even to have been drafted yet. This would spook the world's financiers. They would want to run a credit check on the new CEO, and might even withdraw his funding in the meantime. A mini currency crisis might be his first challenge in the Oval Office. Not that he's likely to get there, of course. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Edmond Warner is chief executive of IFX Group </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:edmond.warner@theguardian.com\">edmond.warner@theguardian.com</a></p>",

  "<p>British authorities have opened a new front in the widening investigation into allegations of bribery at Halliburton, the American oil services business, while it was being run by the US vice-president, Dick Cheney.</p> <p>The Guardian has learned that the Serious Fraud Office has joined the international effort at the request of the US Department of Justice in Washington. French and Nigerian officials are already involved in the inquiry.</p> <p>Halliburton has become a political liability for the Bush administration as the US prepares to vote in presidential elections next week.</p> <p>The company, one of the chief government contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan, has been dogged by controversy, which includes claims of White House favouritism in awarding the firm billions of dollars of contracts without being forced to bid and Pentagon allegations that the firm has massively overcharged for its work.</p> <p>It emerged late on Thursday that the FBI had launched an inquiry into how Halliburton secured contracts in Iraq, so far worth almost $9bn (\u00a34.9bn).</p> <p>The Nigerian investigation centres on $180m in payments allegedly made by a consortium led by Halliburton to secure the contract to build a natural gas plant in Nigeria.</p> <p>The cash was allegedly channelled through a US-owned oil engineering firm in London called MW Kellogg and was handled by a company executive based in Berkshire. The funds were said to have been paid into a Swiss bank by a British lawyer.</p> <p>The Democratic challenger, John Kerry, has made repeated jibes at Halliburton during his campaign for the White House, suggesting that the vice-president is using his position to look after his friends. Referring to the shortage of flu vaccine in the US, Mr Kerry told a rally in Orlando last week: \"If Halliburton made flu shots, you'd have more flu shots here than there are oranges in the state of Florida.\"</p> <p>Mr Cheney ran Dallas-based Halliburton for five years before quitting to run for office in 2000. He banked $36m when he left and continues to receive deferred income from the company. There has been no suggestion that Mr Cheney had any personal knowledge of the Nigerian payments.</p> <p>When Mr Kerry's running mate, John Edwards, referred to the Nigerian scandal during a televised debate earlier this month, Mr Cheney said there was \"no substance\" to the charges. But Halliburton admitted last month that it had found evidence that bribery was at least discussed. In June, the US company cut ties with a former senior executive, Jack Stanley, and said he had received as much as $5m in \"improper personal benefits\" related to the Nigerian scandal. The company has said it is cooperating with authorities.</p> <p>A French judge has been inquiring into the alleged bribes for the past two years. He has been joined by a Nigerian par liamentary commission. The scandal has gathered pace in recent months as the justice department and the chief US financial watchdog, the Securities and Exchange Commission, launched investigations.</p> <p>The French judge, Renaud Van Ruymbeke, has called for Halliburton's agent, London solicitor Jeffrey Tesler, to return to Paris next month for a second round of questioning. Mr Tesler has denied wrongdoing.</p> <p>Malcolm Bruce, the Liberal Democrat trade spokesman who has pressed the British government to investigate the bribery allegations, welcomed the SFO inquiry but questioned why it had taken so long.</p> <p>\"Clearly the SFO is only about to take action, well after everyone else and only when asked by other governments who have been taking action for months. The British government appears to have a pretty supine and passive attitude to stamping out bribery in international contracts. The resources are not there, the will is not there.\"</p> <p>Halliburton was secretly awarded a contract ahead of the Iraq invasion, then worth up to $7bn, to help repair the country's oil industry in the wake of war. Halliburton was handed the contract without bidding. It was also given an other contract on a no-bid basis to provide logistical backup to American troops.</p> <p>The FBI investigation is based on claims by a senior army contracting official who claims she was frozen out of decisions when she questioned the Halliburton contracts.</p> <p>Halliburton has repeatedly denied wrongdoing. \"The old allegations have once again been recycled, this time one week before the election,\" a spokeswoman said.</p> <p>The company has paid $7.5m to settle claims that it failed to disclose a crucial change in its accounting policy that allowed it to report higher profits and shore up its share price while Mr Cheney was in charge.</p>",
  "The president of the Royal Academy has resigned unexpectedly on the grounds of ill health. His senior staff denied yesterday that he had been pushed. <p>Sir Philip King, who has held the post for five years, quit at a meeting of the RA governing body on Thursday night, to unconfirmed reports that 30 of the 80 academicians had signed a letter calling for an election to be held for his post. </p> <p>Sir Philip, 70, a sculptor whose first one-man show was at the Venice Biennale in 1968, told his fellow governors: \"Unfortunately, I have been advised, following my heart operation of two years ago, not to continue to undertake such a demanding role. I am proud of what we have achieved\". </p> <p>The treasurer, Paul Huxley, said: \"We totally understand and respect Phillip King's decision to step down.

Mr Patten had packed and was ready to leave, but now faces the prospect of working on until as late as December. </p> <p>Of the two men, it is expected that Mr Kinnock, the leader of the Labour party between 1983 and 1992, will be the more active on the domestic scene. </p> <p>He said yesterday that the Lords was \"a good base for campaigning on national issues like education, sustainable transport, industrial change and the ageing society, and global concerns, particularly poverty and oppression. </p> <p>\"It is a forum for putting the continuing case for our country's effective engagement in the EU. I will seek to make constructive contributions in these and other areas as a Labour peer.\" </p> <p>Mr Kinnock has already secured a job as the chairman of the British Council, succeeding the Labour peer Helena Kennedy. </p> <p>But Mr Kinnock's decision to join the Lords, even though more than 90 hereditary peers remain, shows his determination to get back into domestic politics after nine years as a British commissioner. </p> <p>As the leader of the Labour party he advocated a second chamber wholly elected on a regional basis. The party's next manifesto is likely to advocate some form of indirect elections, but no final decision has been made. </p> <p>There has been - probably premature - speculation that he might join a Blair cabinet as the leader of the Lords after the general election. First, he will have to find out whether he can tolerate the staid atmosphere of the upper house. </p> <p>Mr Kinnock may also become active in Welsh politics. He has long been an opponent of Welsh devolution, and is hostile to the granting of substantial extra powers to the Welsh assembly, an idea under consideration in the party. </p> <p>But in the short term Mr Kinnock and Mr Patten will try to make their mark putting the case for Europe. </p> <p>Both men have joined the board of the Britain in Europe campaign group. They are likely to play important roles in the two bills ratifying the EU constitution and the subsequent bill paving the way for the referendum on the constitution. </p> <p>Mr Patten, a former chairman of the Conservative party, said yesterday: \"I am honoured to be invited to become a life peer when I leave the European commission. </p> <p>\"It will give me the opportunity, as a Conservative peer, to contribute to the national debate on issues like higher education, research, Europe and foreign policy.\"</p>",
  "The United States made its boldest foray into tomorrow's tense presidential election in Ukraine by threatening to take \"measures\" if the voting was unfair. <p>The US mission to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which is monitoring the election, said that if it failed to meet international standards \"a variety of measures\" against those responsible for electoral misconduct would be considered.</p> <p>\"Bilateral relations and integration into Euro-Atlantic institutions will suffer,\" it added.</p> <p>\"In addition, we are increasingly concerned by reports strongly indicating that government forces are behind numerous provocative and violent acts, such as the beating of peaceful protesters by ministry of interior employees the weekend of October 23-24.\"</p> <p>A spokesman for the US embassy in Kiev declined to elaborate on what sanctions were under consideration.</p> <p>The statement is the latest in a series of interventions aimed at aiding the opposition candidate, Viktor Yushchenko.</p> <p>Washington has accused the Ukrainian government of skewing the poll in favour of the prime minister, Viktor Yanukovich - President Leonid Kuchma's preferred suc cessor - by clamping down on the state media and throwing the resources of the state behind its man.</p> <p>Yesterday more than 160 journalists from six leading private television channels issued a statement protesting at alleged censorship and pressure on news media during the closing stages of the campaign.</p> <p>\"[The] authorities and some owners and managers of TV channels are trying to keep us silent,\" said the statement, quoted by Interfax news agency.</p> <p>On Thursday seven leading journalists on 1+1TV said they would quit their jobs in protest at what they described as state-imposed censorship. \"We refuse to take part in the information war,\" their statement said.</p> <p>Earlier this week journalists of Kiev's independent TV5 staged a hunger strike, accusing the government of cracking down on the media.</p> <p>The US statement will increase the tension between Moscow and Washington, which have seized on this election to back the rival candidates. Washington has sent a series of emissaries, including George Bush Sr and Henry Kissinger, to Kiev to call for fair elections.</p> <p>Richard Armitage, the US assistant secretary of state, wrote in the Financial Times yesterday that the \"Ukrainian authorities can put an end to the violations that have plagued the campaign\", and warned that \"a bad election... will force us to re-examine our relationship\".</p> <p>Moscow has thrown its weight behind Mr Yanukovich, who has promised to bring Ukraine closer to its eastern neighbour. President Vladimir Putin has offered his endorsement, appearing on television to encourage voters to back the government candidate.</p> <p>He also attended an army parade on Thursday, during which a Soviet-style show of military strength prompted the opposition to say that they were trying to frighten the electorate.</p> <p>The Ukrainian government hit back yesterday. Its ambassador to Brussels, Roman Shpek, said in an interview with Reuters that the lack of an EU policy towards Ukraine was tantamount to \"double standards\" - a common phrase used by the Kremlin when dealing with western criticism.</p> <p>Opinion polls suggest that the presidential rivals enjoy near-equal levels of support and may be heading for a second round of voting in November.</p> <p>The tension surrounding the campaign grew yesterday when Mr Yushchenko said his family had been threatened and were in hiding. His pregnant oldest daughter had been threatened with abduction. \"It is impossible to live like this for long, and I am not the only person who lives like this,\" he said.</p> <p>Last night there were unconfirmed reports that four buses rented by the Yushchenko campaign in the Chernovtsy region were blown up overnight in their car park.</p> <p>Last night Mr Yushchenko repeated a call to his supporters to behave calmly on election day, create no provocations and keep a close eye on the voting.</p> <p>\"Be exemplary citizens: don't watch TV, don't drink alcohol on October 31. Go to election districts, vote and wait for results there... It's very important to prevent falsifications,\" he said at a news conference.</p> <p>Mr Yanukovych made a similar call, Interfax reported, telling his supporters: \"You don't have to yield to provocations... you don't have to take part in any violent actions.\"</p> <p>He added: \"I don't understand the politicians who are dreaming of a violent seizure of power, under the cover of the name 'democratic opposition'.\"</p> <p>Those who oppose Mr Yanukovych say winning would close the door to the west, stifling the country's strong but still tenuous recent economic upswing.</p>",
  "Four days before the US presidential election, a new videotape of Osama bin Laden surfaced yesterday, with the al-Qaida leader admitting responsibility for the first time for the September 11, 2001 attacks, and threatening new strikes against America. <p>If genuine - and US intelligence officials last night indicated the man on the video was indeed the al-Qaida leader - the tape broadcast by al-Jazeera television is an audacious attempt by Bin Laden to leave his imprint on the US electoral process. </p> <p>Although the White House said last night there was no immediate change in the US terror alert level, there are also fears that it could be a coded warning to al-Qaida operatives for a fresh attack. Warnings of a spectacular strike on US soil in the run-up to the vote were in circulation earlier this year. </p> <p>Bin Laden played directly on such fears in yesterday's video, which offered the first glimpse of him in more than a year. It was also his first direct appeal to the American people, and the al-Qaida leader warned they could well face a repetition of the 9/11 attacks. </p> <p>\"Despite entering the fourth year after September 11, Bush is still deceiving you and hiding the truth from you, and therefore the reasons are still there to repeat what happened,\" he said. </p> <p>Although he is the most hunted man on earth, Bin Laden made it clear that he had had time to keep close watch on public debate in the US - or at least was familiar with the accusation that the attacks would have been far less deadly if President Bush had been swift to act. </p> <p>He also suggested that the idea for the September 11 attacks stretched back as far as two decades to the Israeli aerial bombardment of tall buildings in Beirut in 1982. </p> <p>Yesterday's videotape ex ploded on to the campaign trail just as the two candidates were poised to deliver their closing arguments to the American electorate. </p> <p>The message ensured that the war on terror remains the defining issue in the most fiercely contested election in recent memory. </p> <p>President Bush and his Democratic challenger, John Kerry, have been scathing in attacking each other's credentials on national security. After launching his campaign with images of the World Trade Centre in flames, Mr Bush went on to accuse Mr Kerry of lacking the resolve to lead the fight against al-Qaida. </p> <p>The Democratic challenger accuses his opponent of compromising the hunt for al-Qaida because of his preoccupation with Saddam Hussein. </p> <p>But both leaders declined to rise to Bin Laden's bait - at least in the short term. \"Let me make this very clear: Americans will not be intimidated, or influenced by an enemy of our country,\" Mr Bush said. \"We are at war with these terrorists and I am confident that we will prevail.\" </p> <p>The president refused to comment on Bin Laden's claim that he had been astounded by Mr Bush's decision, after being told of the attacks, to remain in a Florida classroom reading a children's book about a pet goat. </p> <p>In the video, Bin Laden said: \"It never occurred to us that he, the commander in chief of the country, would leave 50,000 citizens in the two towers to face those horrors alone, because he thought listening to a child discussing her goats was more important.\" </p> <p>Mr Kerry, who has assailed Mr Bush every day this week for taking his eye off al-Qaida by going to war in Iraq, also refused to be drawn into Bin Laden's game. </p> <p>\"All of us in the country are completely united,\" he said. \"We are all united hunting down and capturing or killing those who conduct that raid. We always knew it was Osama bin Laden.\" </p> <p>But while both candidates took the high road yesterday, it seemed evident the tape would have an impact on the presidential race. </p> <p>Although Bin Laden's intervention appears calculated to hurt Mr Bush's re-election chances, reminding American voters that the US president has failed to catch the al-Qaida leader, most commentators thought the ploy would rebound against Mr Kerry. </p> <p>Mr Bush has consistently outscored Mr Kerry on the security question in opinion polls, and the re-emergence of Bin Laden could persuade Americans they need to send a strong man to the White House next Tuesday. </p> <p>The tape also served to confound hopes that Bin Laden was dead, or at least incapacitated, following reports that he had been seriously wounded or was gravely ill with kidney disease. </p> <p>Instead, the Osama bin Laden who surfaced yesterday was very much alive, and apparently fit, dressed in golden cloak and white turban, and sitting in front of a desk in front of a plain backdrop. </p> <p>He gave no hint that he was on the run, speaking with apparent composure, in his first appearance on film in two years. It was unclear where the tape was recorded although Bin Laden is believed to be in the border regions of Afghanistan and Pakistan. </p> <p>It was also unclear when - although Bin Laden made reference to the US death toll in Iraq reaching the 1,000 mark, suggesting the tape had a fairly recent provenance. </p> <p>Al-Jazeera received the tape on Friday, but did not say how. The US state department said it urged the government of Qatar, where the station is based, to discourage it from broadcasting the message. </p> <p>Last night's message differed from previous audio and video tapes released by Bin Laden, with a first direct appeal to the American people. </p> <p>But the message was chilling: neither Mr Bush nor Mr Kerry could guarantee their safety, he said. </p> <p>\"Your security is not in the hands of Kerry or Bush or al-Qaida. Your security is in your own hands,\" he said. </p> <p>\"To the US people, my talk is to you about the best way to avoid another disaster,\" he said. \"I tell you: security is an important element of human life and free people do not give up their security.\"</p>",
  "<b>The following are excerpts from a speech by Osama bin Laden addressing the American people in a videotape, parts of which were aired by al-Jazeera television yesterday, as translated by Reuters</b> <p>O American people, I am speaking to tell you about the ideal way to avoid another Manhattan, about war and its causes and results. </p> <p>Security is an important foundation of human life and free people do not squander their security, contrary to Bush's claims that we hate freedom. Let him tell us why we did not attack Sweden for example. </p> <p>It is known that those who hate freedom do not possess proud souls like those of the 19, may God rest their souls. We fought you because we are free and because we want freedom for our nation. When you squander our security we squander your's. </p> <p>I'm surprised by you. Despite entering the fourth year after September 11, Bush is still deceiving you and hiding the truth from you and therefore the reasons are still there to repeat what happened. </p> <p>God knows it did not cross our minds to attack the towers but after the situation became unbearable and we witnessed the injustice and tyranny of the American-Israeli alliance against our people in Palestine and Lebanon, I thought about it. And the events that affected me directly were that of 1982 and the events that followed - when America allowed the Israelis to invade Lebanon, helped by the US sixth fleet. </p> <p>In those difficult moments many emotions came over me which are hard to describe, but which produced an overwhelming feeling to reject injustice and a strong determination to punish the unjust. </p> <p>As I watched the destroyed towers in Lebanon, it occurred to me punish the unjust the same way [and] to destroy towers in America so it could taste some of what we are tasting and to stop killing our children and women. </p> <p>We had no difficulty in dealing with Bush and his administration because they resemble the regimes in our countries, half of which are ruled by the military and the other half by the sons of kings ... They have a lot of pride, arrogance, greed and thievery. </p> <p>[Bush] adopted despotism and the crushing of freedoms from Arab rulers _ called it the Patriot Act under the guise of combating terrorism ... </p> <p>We had agreed with [the September 11] overall commander, Mohammed Atta, may God rest his soul, to carry out all operations in 20 minutes before Bush and his administration take notice. </p> <p>It never occurred to us that the commander-in-chief of the American forces [Bush] would leave 50,000 citizens in the two towers to face those horrors alone at a time when they most needed him because he thought listening to a child discussing her goat and its ramming was more important than the planes and their ramming of the skyscrapers. This had given us three times the time needed to carry out the operations, thanks be to God ... </p> <p>Your security is not in the hands of [Democratic presidential candidate John] Kerry or Bush or al-Qaida. Your security is in your own hands and each state which does not harm our security will remain safe.</p>",
  "US security forces anticipated Osama bin Laden's al-Qaida would try to intervene in the presidential election, but expected that action to take the shape of a bomb blast or some other terrorist outrage rather than last night's video warning. <p>Bin Laden's impact on the US election will be a matter of debate over the next few days and in the election aftermath. But the initial instinct is that it will be more helpful to George Bush than to John Kerry. </p> <p>His appearance is a reminder to the electorate of September 11 and the \"war on terror\" that Mr Bush has championed. The incumbent has tended to poll higher than Mr Kerry on this issue, being seen as the more reliable of the two. </p> <p>Al-Qaida and the loose groupings that share its general aims have shown themselves to be acutely aware of the politics of the west. In the age of satellite communications, Bin Laden and his associates can watch on televison in detail the internal politics of any country. </p> <p>The North Africans who carried out the murderous blasts in Madrid in the week running up to the March general election demonstrated a new-found sense of political timing, leaving the government of Jos\u00e9 Aznar floundering. </p> <p>The Spanish electorate may have already decided to oust Mr Aznar before the bombings. But his attempt to blame Basque separatists rather than the al-Qaida-related group angered Spanish citizens. Mr Aznar had put Spanish troops into the US-led coalition with Iraq, and his successor pulled them out. </p> <p>The timing of the Madrid attack was no coincidence. The captors of Kenneth Bigley in Iraq, the Tawhid and Jihad group, showed an awareness of internal British politics. They put direct pressure on Tony Blair, by forcing Mr Bigley to appeal to the prime minister to save his life. </p> <p>Both Mr Bush and Mr Kerry united in condemning Bin Laden and promising to hunt him down. Both deny he can influence the election. </p> <p>In one sense, Bin Laden's sudden re-emergence could help Mr Kerry. It is a reminder that Mr Bush has failed to capture him. It could also strengthen Mr Kerry's charge that Iraq is a diversion from the war against al-Qaida. </p> <p>That would play in Europe but less so in the US, where polls continue to show a majority of Americans believe there was a link between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaida. </p> <p>On his own terms, Bin Laden has been a success. Since September 11, the Middle East has become more dangerous and volatile, not just in Iraq. In Saudi Arabia, he has partly achieved his original goal by forcing most of the US soldiers to leave and to have strained relations between Washington and Riyadh. Saudi Arabia, too, faces internal problems from al-Qaida. </p> <p>Bin Laden's ability to mount attacks appears to have waned, in spite of the string of terrorist attacks from Indonesia to Turkey since September by groups related to al-Qaida. Neither al-Qaida or the Taliban were able to disrupt the Afghanistan election. </p> <p>Nor has Bin Laden been capable so far of mounting further attacks in the US since September 11. But his video last night could prove almost as damaging.</p>",
  "<p>While the candidates race through the swing states, the real election battleground is the American living room. Each night, and throughout the day on many cable channels, the pundits and pontificators create their own frenzy, feeding on and exaggerating events on the campaign trail.</p> <p>Unlike British television news, the American networks thrive on their partisanship. And the presenters, too, are proud to wear their political beliefs on their sleeves.</p> <p>Rupert Murdoch's Fox News has Bill O'Reilly, rumpled and snarling, renowned for telling his guests to \"shut up\", and embroiled in a less than savoury lawsuit involving a young female Fox producer and allegations of phone sex.</p> <p>CBS, if you believe the Bush administration, is the liberal home of the veteran anchor Dan Rather and his 60 Minutes programme.</p> <p>MSNBC has Ron Reagan, liberal son of the late president, an engaging and unflappable presence.</p> <p>Facing him most nights on MSNBC is Joe Scarborough, a former Republican congressman for Florida and a self-proclaimed redneck. His role seems to be to try to inflame Reagan and the other liberals on the channel's After Hours political talkshow.</p> <p>ABC has Chris Matthews, the closest US television gets to a Jeremy Paxman, renowned for his forensic attention to detail. A political junkie and policy wonk, his hoarse-of-voice pumped-up persona communicates an enthusiasm for politics that is both irritating and engaging.</p> <p>Then there is CNN, the doyen of round-the-clock cable channels. CNN is a Republican surrogate or an example of the liberal degradation of the nation's media, depending whom you ask and which part of the country they live in.</p> <p>Last week Crossfire, a top CNN political show, came under attack from the new kid on the block, Comedy Central's The Daily Show and its host Jon Stewart, watched by 1.2m viewers at 11pm, four nights a week.</p> <p>An acerbic, ironic and pointed take on the day's news, The Daily Show dominates the ratings among the young viewers so beloved of advertisers and politicians. A spinoff, America - the Book, tops the bestseller lists, and Stewart's face beams from numerous magazine covers.</p> <p>Stewart's programme follows the format of most political shows: bombastic theme music, a studio guest, roving reporters, and a besuited presenter who introduces the programme with a monologue based on the day's events.</p> <p>But there the similarities end. Its election coverage bears the title Indecision 2004 and its reporting on Iraq runs over the words Mess O'Potamia.</p> <p>\"We're a comedy show,\" Stewart said at the Emmys, where the programme picked up two awards. \"Good with a pun, skilled in the art of the punchline.\"</p> <p>The Daily Show's irreverence has not prevented it being treated as part of the political process it mercilessly mocks. Bill Clinton has appeared on it, and John Edwards chose to announce his candidacy on the show.</p> <p>The calibre of guest it attracts may have something to do with the fact that the show is watched by more 18-34-year-olds than the network news.</p> <p>When Stewart appeared on CNN's Crossfire, the two worlds collided.</p> <p>Crossfire sets conservative pundits against liberals, goading them to shout at each other about the issues of the day. Stewart refused to play the liberal-bites-conservative game.</p> <p>Instead, he took the show's hosts to task for failing in their duty to talk about the issues and preferring to indulge in what he called \"partisan hackery\".</p> <p>Accused of being too soft on John Kerry when the candidate appeared on his Comedy Central show, Stewart responded with an attack on the values of CNN and the rest of the serious media.</p>",
  "A former Thatcher cheerleader, who made his fortune trading oil, the Conservative frontbencher Alan Duncan should be a natural Bush supporter. <p>But on Tuesday night the shadow international development secretary will be praying that John Kerry wins. </p> <p>\"If Kerry wins it will clear the slate,\" he says, one of the few MPs on friendly terms with the senator, whom he met when studying at Harvard in the 1980s. </p> <p>A George Bush supporter in 2000, Mr Duncan now has his Commons' office decorated with Kerry-Edwards posters, symbolic of the fact that most MPs - Labour and Tory - will be rooting for the Democrats, and hoping that the president is \"re-defeated\", as the new cry goes. </p> <p>The Labour love-in with Mr Kerry is simple to explain. MPs loath Mr Bush as one of the most rightwing presidents in US history, whose invasion of Iraq has severely weakened their government. </p> <p>Andrew Mackinlay, a Labour MP on the foreign affairs select committee, says: \"A Kerry victory will give us a great opportunity for a fresh start. It may not lead to a dramatic change in Iraq but I think it will give us an opportunity to reassess where we are.\" </p> <p>Downing St is officially neutral, though intensive preparations are being made behind the scenes. One minister said that Mr Blair, who would be sorry on a personal level if President Bush lost, was keeping a level head. </p> <p>\"It is win for win for Tony,\" the minister said. \"A Kerry victory would liberate him from Bush. Tony would not be exposed on Iraq, because both men would immediately make huge efforts to get on. A Bush victory would silence critics who say Tony will be exposed.\" </p> <p>Relations between No 10 and the Kerry camp seemed to be strained earlier this year when the senator was \"out of town\" when the prime minister visited to Washington. </p> <p>But Peter Hain, the Commons leader, paved the way for a kiss and make up meeting when he met Kerry aides such as Bob Shrum during a visit to the campaign in the summer. </p> <p>\"Peter's visit was sanctioned and it is notable that he only visited the Democrats,\" a government source said. </p> <p>Tory motives for backing Mr Kerry combine high and low politics. The Howard camp, which fell out with the White House when he was made persona non grata for attacking the prime minister on Iraq, believes a Kerry victory will leave Mr Blair exposed. </p> <p>\"Blair will be the last major world leader arguing how right it was to invade Iraq,\" a senior aide said. </p> <p>Other Tories believe a Kerry win will be better for Britain and the US. The health spokesman Simon Burns, Mr Kerry's most fervent Tory supporter, is so excited that he will huddle up in front of CNN for the results. </p> <p>Mr Burns, who worked on George McGovern's campaign against Nixon in 1972, says: \"I will be elated if John Kerry wins. It will allow the USA to gain its respect again in the world community and to work as a partner rather than isolating countries as being 'With us or against us'.\" </p> <p>But a band of Tories led by William Hague are still with Mr Bush. They say the president is still the best person for the job. </p> <p>The frontbencher Tim Loughton, who attended the Republican convention in New York, says: \"George Bush is the best bet in terms of standing up to terrorism.\"</p>",
  "America's electoral battlefield spread out to the far-flung state of Hawaii yesterday as the Democratic and Republican campaigns turned out their highest voltage celebrities in a last dash for votes. <p>After weeks in which the main poll fighting was restricted to fewer than a dozen of the 50 states, the campaign's horizons stretched out to Hawaii, a hitherto Democratic bastion in the mid-Pacific. </p> <p>The two big parties, meanwhile, resorted to the world of celebrity to give an extra sizzle to their campaigns, and to draw in the dwindling band of undecided voters. </p> <p>Arnold Schwarzenegger, former bodybuilder and Republican governor of California, joined President Bush at a rally in Columbus, Ohio, and urged the party faithful with typical vigour not to let up. </p> <p>\"Today I'm here to pump you up,\" he intoned in a speech bursting with self-referential quips. \"If you flex your muscles on November 2 I guarantee you, President Bush will be back.\" </p> <p>Mr Bush produced a pun of his own. \"He and I share some things in common - we both married well, we both have trouble speaking the English language, we both got big biceps. Well, two out of three ain't bad.\" </p> <p>For the Democrats, meanwhile, there was Bruce Springsteen, who turned out tens of thousands of people at rallies in Wisconsin and Ohio on Thursday night, delivering live renditions of the anthem that Mr Kerry has adopted as his theme song, No Surrender. The rock star was to accompany Mr Kerry to Florida later yesterday. </p> <p>The Democrats also plan to roll out the party's in-house \"rock star\" for one last tour before voting day. Bill Clinton, who rose from his sick bed earlier this week after heart surgery, goes on the road again to Nevada and New Mexico. </p> <p>Mr Clinton ends his tour tomorrow in his native Arkansas, a state that voted for Mr Bush in 2000, but which the Democrats are hoping to prise away this time round. It carries a potentially crucial six electoral college votes. </p> <p>Mr Bush had hoped to harness another celebrity yesterday by campaigning with Boston Red Sox pitcher, Curt Schilling, who is basking in his team's first World Series victory for 86 years. </p> <p>Schilling, a Texan who thrilled fans by playing with an injured and bleeding ankle, told a television interviewer on Thursday he was voting for Mr Bush. He was immediately signed up by the Republicans to accompany the president to New Hampshire today. </p> <p>The endorsement came as a rebuff to Mr Kerry, who is a passionate supporter of the team and wore a Red Sox cap on the campaign trail this week in honour of their victory. In the end, Schilling cancelled the appearance, saying he had been advised by doctors to rest his ankle. </p> <p>The spotlight on Hawaii is a first in modern American election campaigns. President Bush has visited the state just once, in 2001, and the last major presidential candidate to come calling was Richard Nixon in 1960. </p> <p>But two newspaper polls this week showing the Republicans within striking distance of the Democrats put the islands in play, with a ferocious last-minute battle for its relatively puny prize of four electoral college votes. </p> <p>On Thursday, the Democrats dropped $200,000 (\u00a3110,000) in new television advertising on the state, and both sides were to send in high-powered campaigners at the weekend. For the Democrats, Mr Kerry's daughter, Alexandra, was to appear at a rally last night along with former vice-president Al Gore. </p> <p>Vice-President Dick Cheney takes his turn late tomorrow night, logging an additional 13 hours in the air, and a 38-hour bout of campaigning in the final hours of the campaign. </p> <p>Since attaining statehood in 1959, Hawaii has swung Republican in only two elections. Mr Gore won the state by nearly 20 percentage points in 2000. But the merest glimmer that Hawaii could be up for grabs is enough to get the two campaigns moving. </p> <p>\"Hawaii is a state where the president's leadership resonates,\" Mr Cheney's spokeswoman, Ann Womack, told reporters. \"It's a very close race. We think it's worth a trip.\"</p>"
