  "America's increasingly bitter race for the White House hit a new low as the two candidates traded insults with each other in the aftermath of last week's first presidential debate. <p>John Kerry is seeking to capitalise on his widely perceived victory in the debate, while George W Bush is seeking to bounce back from a poor performance. Kerry's campaign appearances now include a parody of Bush as an Elmer Fudd-type character who cannot speak clearly on the issue of the Iraq war. </p> <p>'He keeps trying to say, \"Well, we're-not-we-don't-no-we-don't-you-know, we don't want somebody who wants to leave [Iraq]\"', Kerry told a cheering audience at a rally in Florida. </p> <p>Democrats are delighted at Kerry's performance in Thursday's Miami debate. Nearly all pundits and polls of viewers showed he had bested Bush in the 90-minute talk about foreign policy, dominated by Iraq. Bush appeared rattled and angry on several occasions. He mispronounced several words and phrases and even Republican spin doctors privately concede he was not at his best. </p> <p>Perhaps seeking to regain lost ground, Bush has also hit the campaign trail with an all-time high level of hostility. In New Hampshire he slammed Kerry on Iraq and said the Democrat would end up letting America's national security decisions be vetoed 'by countries like France'. He also lampooned Kerry as a man who loved to talk but never made decisions. 'I've never seen a meeting that would depose a tyrant, or bring a terrorist to justice,' Bush said. </p> <p>However, while round one of the debating season may have gone to Kerry, both candidates are preparing for round two in St Louis, Missouri. The state is a barometer of political opinion and has voted for the winning candidate in every presidential election bar one since 1900. At the moment Bush has a healthy lead in the state, but Democrats hope they can chip away at that as the second debate will focus more on domestic policy. Though polls show Bush's strength among voters lies with his image as a tough leader on national security, Kerry does much better on issues such as the economy and healthcare. </p> <p>The debate will be different from Florida in that it will employ a 'town hall' format where ordinary Americans will ask the questions, not a professional journalist. However, there are likely to be few surprises from the carefully picked audience of nominally undecided voters. All questions have been submitted in advance and a moderator will silence anyone who departs from a pre-approved script. The subject matter is also decided by the two campaigns as a mix of domestic and foreign topics, no matter what people in the debating chamber might believe is more important.</p>",
  "I have only once been to a county cricket match; I have never been again. The problem was that, from the stands, I couldn't see the ball. That didn't matter, my companion told me, because you can infer the presence of the ball from the body language and movements of the players. In that case, I asked him, why have a ball at all? <p>The same thought went through my mind in the early hours of Friday morning, just after the first American presidential debate had finished. As the candidates left the stage at the University of Miami, the camera cut to the BBC's correspondent Katty Kay in the nearby press-room. 'What's going to happen in this room in the next hour,' she told us, 'as both candidates send their teams out to speak to the media is going to have a huge impact on how voters decide how this debate went.' </p> <p>It didn't really matter what Bush and Kerry had said or how they had said it; what mattered was whose version of what they'd said and how they'd said it the media would pass on to the people of America. </p> <p>This bizarre circularity was already being breached, however. Within minutes, Reuters was reporting from St Anselm's College in Manchester, New Hampshire, where seven voters had been watching the debate. Three were for Bush and stayed for Bush, three were for Kerry and stayed for Kerry, but the seventh, one Adam Schibley, now said he was leaning strongly toward Kerry. </p> <p>Early analysis concentrated on the bodies, not the ball. Kerry had won the cutaway campaign, said those who'd watched it splitscreen on C-Span. He took notes when Bush spoke, whereas Bush variously grimaced, winced, smirked or almost shook his head while Kerry was talking. Within hours, the Democratic National Committee had released a video of Bush's cutaways. </p> <p>I thought Bush looked a bit scared while Kerry was right at home. Once again, with his height, booming voice and dense hair, the senator reminded me of a tree, while the prehensile lips and small button eyes of the President have always suggested a small monkey to the cartoonists of the world. At one difficult moment, you half expected Bush to run up Kerry's trunk and take refuge in the topmost foliage, far above the carping, difficult world. </p> <p>The simian image ended at looks. Bush will have surprised jaundiced Europeans by getting his countries right, recalling what the US had done in Liberia and knowing that, in Darfur, 'the rainy season will be ending soon'. It was Kerry, strangely enough, who erred, locating the cells of the KGB headquarters in Moscow as being 'under Treblinka Square'. He must have meant under the Lubianka or under Dzerzhinsky Square - Treblinka was a Nazi extermination camp. </p> <p>BUush was more religious and emotional, climbing a mountain to see the valley of peace and tearing up with a war widow; Kerry was more incisive and analytical. But their tasks had been delineated long before Thursday night. In a piece written for the latest issue of Atlantic Monthly, James Fallows predicted that each would have a single message. 'George Bush will try in his every answer to convey, \"I am a wartime President, and I am strong.\" John Kerry will try to convey, \"You don't know what you are doing and you are weak.\"' </p> <p>So they did. 'He changes positions and you can't change positions in the war on terror if you want to win,' charged Bush. 'Mixed messages send the wrong signals.' 'You can be certain and be wrong,' replied Kerry. Or, as a Democratic strategist said on Friday: 'Go back through the transcript and you'll see it boils down to four words: more of the same. Kerry is a new direction for the future and Bush seems stuck in the past and doesn't acknowledge the troubles.' </p> <p>Given the need for the candidates simultaneously to avoid making a big mistake, to have their body speak the correct language, and for them to repeat the core, boiled-down message, perhaps we Brits shouldn't pay too much attention to what was actually said. Who, after all, remembers what was promised in the Gore/Bush debates of 2000? I certainly don't. </p> <p>And the situation is the situation. Whatever Kerry says he would or would not have done in Iraq (the invasion of which he compared to conquering Mexico because of Pearl Harbor), the fact is that the coalition is there, the violence is happening and the elections are planned for January, the month when a President Kerry would be inaugurated. What can we tell from the debate about the way this potential new head of state might behave? </p> <p>'Under Bush,' said Kerry, 'the best case scenario - what we have now. Worst case scenario - civil war. I can do better.' Or, as he put it for the benefit of US troops in Iraq: 'My message is: help is on the way!' </p> <p>What help? Take this passage from Kerry. 'Today, we are 90 per cent of the casualties and 90 per cent of the cost: $200 billion - $200 bn that could have been used for health care, for schools, for construction, for prescription drugs for seniors, and it's in Iraq.' The suggestion here, repeated elsewhere during the debate, is that Kerry will reduce the cost in men and materials by getting more allies to sign up for duty in Iraq, presumably during the post-election period. The troops are to be saved not by the US, but by the German cavalry. </p> <p>Yet, though he cited failures in Afghanistan (leaving Bush to comment on the scale of voter registration there), Kerry never allowed that perhaps the greatest failure has been that of Nato countries to provide the peacekeepers they had promised. So he replaced one illusion - that things are basically all right - with another, that 'help is on the way'. </p> <p>And if it isn't, what will President Kerry do to get his fire stations, health care and prescription drugs? Withdraw? And if he faces other challenging situations, how far will he be guided by the political and economic requirements to build almost consensual coalitions? On Sudan, he said there was, indeed, another genocide, and: 'We could never allow another Rwanda.' But how would 'we' stop it? If he has followed the painful progression of the matter of Darfur through the United Nations, he must know that some other countries, like Dickens's Circumlocution Office, are dedicated to the business of not getting things done. </p> <p>And this takes me to what was the most worrying part of Kerry's thinking, as revealed in Miami. 'You know, the President's father did not go into Iraq, into Baghdad, beyond Basra,' Kerry told viewers approvingly. 'And the reason he didn't is because there was no viable exit strategy. And he said our troops would be occupiers in a bitterly hostile land. That's exactly where we find ourselves today.' </p> <p>Quite so. So, instead, he allowed the Shia and Kurdish rebellions to be crushed and the result was 12 years of crippling sanctions, of bombings to enforce the no-fly zones, of non-compliance with UN resolutions and, of course, of Saddamite state terror. Of course, there were no cameras there, except when the Baath command wanted there to be, no visitors except when Saddam allowed in his tame Galloways. Was that, as Kerry was never asked, good policy, because no US troops died, though hundreds of thousands of Iraqis did? And what did that stoke up for the future? </p> <p>There are a thousand reasons for hoping that John Kerry wins the election in November, not least because of the chance of cooling the Anti-American fever in much of the world. But I will also want to know that he sees the same hard ball flying through the air that I see.</p>",
  "<p>Australian-born media mogul Rupert Murdoch could have dug one of the bigger holes of his corporate life if investors block his bid to quit Australia through the creation of a new US-based News Corporation. </p> <p>The move would transfer control of 70 per cent of the nation's newspapers to a foreign company. </p> <p>It is a measure of Murdoch's clout Down Under that in the midst of one of the most tightly fought Australian federal election campaigns in decades there has been barely a whimper from politicians about the pending departure of News Corporation from the Australian stock market. </p> <p>The lack of political debate could also be reassuring for the handful of media interests that dominate Australia's electronic media. </p> <p>They are expected to make another push for the new government to reconsider cross-ownership rules, particularly for pay television and the granting of a new free-to-air television licence. </p> <p>Opposition to News Corporation's relocation is coming from minority shareholders, who are concerned about what it means for their rights, and fund managers worried about short-term pressure on the share price and the effect on the Australian stock exchange of the departure of its largest member. </p> <p>The objections have brought Lachlan Murdoch, tattooed scion of the Murdoch empire, scurrying back to Australia from New York to face critics and stop the opposition growing. </p> <p>'In order to get the benefit of the change in domicile we have to be an American company, like it or not. It has been an emotional decision but we have to become an American company,' he told the Australian press last week. </p> <p>Analysts in favour of the move argue that, as some 70 per cent of the group's revenues come from the US, it makes sense to seek access to the world's deepest capital pool by moving to Delaware. </p> <p>Murdoch's Australian newspapers have also been conspicuously enthusiastic about the deal, earning them a sarcastic blessing as the 'cardinals of the Murdoch pontificate'. </p> <p>An international coalition of advisers to major superannuation (pension) funds representing more than A$1 trillion (\u00a3392 billion) is expected to tell members to vote against the measure at next month's shareholder meeting. </p> <p>'We are surprised that News Corp is asking investors to endorse a proposal that will effectively diminish governance standards, given that we have just come out of a cycle of collapses and failures attributed to poor corporate governance,' said Michael O'Sullivan, president of the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors (ACSI). </p> <p>'With its preoccupation with looking and smelling like a US company, News Corporation has effectively missed an opportunity to smell like roses on governance issues.' </p> <p>While preference shareholders are believed to favour the deal, News Corp is believed to be just short of the 75 per cent approval of holders of ordinary shares required for next month's meeting. </p> <p>The high concentration of media ownership within a handful of players, such as Murdoch and Australia's richest man, Kerry Packer, owner of listed Publishing and Broadcasting (PBL), means the right deal regularly turns rivals intopartners. </p> <p>In recent months, the leader of the federal opposition, Mark Latham, has been invited for a meal at Cavan, the Murdoch family's rural property in New South Wales, with Lachlan and local News Corp chief John Hartigan. </p> <p>One of the topics on the menu was what a future Labour government might do with its half-share in the pay television monopoly in Australia held by telecom giant Telstra (the remainder is split between the Murdoch family and Packer's PBL). </p> <p>The Murdochs and Packers are determined to wrest control of pay television from the government but have conflicting ambitions over a possible fourth free-to-air television network. </p> <p>Australia is the only major market in the world where Murdoch's expansion into the electronic media has been largely blocked by rules prohibit ing the ownership of TV and print media in the same market. </p> <p>Attempts to have those rules changed will be aggressively opposed by rival networks fearful that News Corporation's Hollywood hit factories will dominate the airwaves. </p> <p>It is 20 years since Murdoch, by then an American citizen, raised the political heat by grabbing Australia's leading newspaper group, the Herald and Weekly Times. There was outrage that his domination of print media has left only one other group, John Fairfax Ltd, publishers of the nation's leading broadsheets in Melbourne and Sydney, as a major player. </p> <p>As with News Corp, Fairfax's extensive newspaper interests in Australia and New Zealand inhibit a push into television under current regulation. Given this, there is widespread speculation that the group is planning a bid for the major newspaper in Western Australia. But revenues of the group's flagship capital city newspapers have been hurt by the impact of the internet on classified advertising. </p> <p>'They are the only ones, in my view, that are clearly vulnerable to the better mouse trap that has come along, which is internet classified advertising', says Eric Beecher, former editor-in-chief of the Herald and Weekly Times. </p> <p>' The most vulnerable newspapers are the ones that commit the greatest resources to journalism. It is going to have a devastating effect on the kind of journalism those newspapers can support in the future,' he said. </p> <p>Meanwhile, the Asian edition of the Financial Times has recently conducted a low-profile launch in Australia. </p> <p>Given that the 'pink'un' is selling at nearly twice the cover charge of its local rival, the Australian Financial Review, and confusingly still has a syndication deal that allows the Australian, the only national newspaper, to run the FT's best stories each day, this is perhaps not surprising. </p> <p>But, as so often, it is the outcome of a Murdoch initiative - and the vote on 26 October - that dominates the Australian media agenda.</p>",
  "Perhaps the greatest Irish national conceit is that absolutely everyone everywhere loves us. <p>'Sure everybody loves the Irish' has become the smug refrain echoed around every Irish pub from Boston to Berlin, Copenhagen to Cape Town. It synthesises neatly with that other national conceit - the so-called craic, the notion that the Irish have a divine right to be the most hospitable, entertaining and funny race on earth. </p> <p>The first sentiment permeates even into Irish foreign policy where the Republic, although a small, postcolonial English-speaking nation that is non-aligned militarily, likes to think it exercises disproportionate influence on the world's stage. </p> <p>Undoubtedly, Ireland's long history of postwar peacekeeping, its tradition of fairness and humanitarian concern exemplified in the work of the Irish blue berets, has enhanced the country's reputation around the globe. Sometimes, however, the Irish political and media classes get a little carried away with themselves when it comes to world power play. </p> <p>The family of the British hostage Ken Bigley has lavished praise on the Irish government and opposition figures for trying to secure his release. On one level, the diligence of the Department of Foreign Affairs, and Michael D Higgins in particular, is commendable. On the other hand, there is very little Ireland can do in the circumstances beyond issuing appeals for Bigley's freedom. The Jordanian radical behind the kidnapping, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, certainly 'doesn't love the Irish'. For him, like his former mentor, Osama bin Laden, we are all infidels who must either convert or die. </p> <p>One problem with this typical piece of non-armed and well-meaning form of Irish interventionism is that it has led to why Bigley was kidnapped in the first place. Throughout last week, there were constant references on Irish radio and television to the two female prisoners the Islamist kidnappers want freed in return for Bigley. These 'ladies' actually happen to be two scientists who were crucial in building up the Baath dictatorship's chemical arsenal, some of which was used to gas thousands of Iranians and Kurds. </p> <p>If Higgins believes that the 'two female prisoners' (aka 'the chemical war criminals') should be released, then perhaps he ought first to take a trip to northern Iraq, specifically to Halabja in free Kurdistan. The Labour TD might care to explain to the survivors of the chemical attack that killed more than 5,000 men, women, children and babies why the women behind Saddam's chemical warfare programme ought to walk free without trial. </p> <p>To surrender to the uncompromising al-Zarqawi would be akin to the Allies post-1945 handing over the Nazi scientists who devised the gas chambers after the kidnapping of a British sapper in Dusseldorf. Moreover, the notion that the Kurds should be robbed of their chance to put on trial the two war criminals, Rihab Taha and Huda Amash, whose programme led to the genocide at Halabja, is monstrous in the extreme. </p> <p>At the end of last week, the daughter of one of the Disappeared contrasted Gerry Adams' deep concern for the British hostage in Iraq with the Sinn Fein President's 23 years of inertia over her father's plight. </p> <p>The IRA's South Armagh brigade abducted, murdered and buried Charlie Armstrong as he made his way to Mass in Crossmaglen in 1981. His daughter, Anna McShane, said she had no real problem with Adams calling for the release of an innocent man. However, she added that Adams would be better suited putting his energies into locating and returning the body of her father. </p> <p>There can be no doubt that Charlie Armstrong was 'disappeared'. Yet why is it that the Irish Times insists as it did yesterday on referring to these victims as 'the so-called \"disappeared\"'. As far as I remember, the Irish Times never referred to the victims of British miscarriages of justice 'the so-called Birmingham Six' or 'the so-called Guildford Four'. </p> <p>D'Olier Street should stop insulting the memory of these victims and their families. </p> <p>Back in the Clinton-dominated 1990s, the US Democrats partied at one of their conventions with mass dancing to that obnoxious song 'The Macarena'. After President Mary McAleese's unchallenged return to Phoenix Park this weekend, perhaps the Irish Labour Party should follow the Democrats' example and subject their delegates at the next annual conference to a little dance of their own. All the comrades have to do is flap their two arms about like a bird, dart their heads back and forward and belt out the words to the tune of that equally obnoxious television ad for a certain poultry sauce, 'I feel like chicken tonight, chicken tonight'. Nothing could be more appropriate for a party that chickened out of a presidential election campaign. At least Dana and Eamon Ryan, who tried so hard to give the Irish people a democratic choice, can walk away with their heads held high. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:henry.mcdonald@observer.co.uk\">henry.mcdonald@observer.co.uk</a></p>",
  "Somewhere in the bleary early hours of last Friday morning, a bunch of jubilant strangers gatecrashed the victory party of Labour's newest MP. <p>The activists from the anti-European UK Independence Party (Ukip) might ordinarily have expected to be barred from the Hartlepool HQ of Ian Wright. But not, it seems, on a by-election night in which they forced the Conservatives into a humiliating fourth place. 'As we'd beaten the Tories, we were welcome,' recalls Clive Page, their Hartlepool spokesman. </p> <p>This weekend, as he prepares for his first party conference as Conservative leader, Michael Howard faces a peculiarly unholy alliance against him. </p> <p>From the right, Ukip is marching on Tory heartlands with its promises of withdrawal from the EU; to the left, the Lib Dems are scooping up the disaffected Labour protest votes that Howard needs. Squeezed in the middle are the Tories, trying to decide where to open fire first. </p> <p><b>The plan for power</b><br> </p> <p>This week, Howard's team will unveil plans for their first day, first week and first month in government, a bold move to make them look poised triumphantly on the brink of power. Just days after what shadow defence secretary Nicholas Soames succinctly described as a 'fucking awful' result in Hartlepool, they might struggle to look convincing. </p> <p>Yet the irony is that Howard, who was elected unopposed as a unity candidate more than 11 months ago, following the vicious disposal of Iain Duncan Smith, has done most of what his party asked. He has restored the Tories' credibility at Westminster, boosted dwindling membership, opened party donors' chequebooks and quelled the eternal plotting that destroyed his predecessors. </p> <p>The only thing he has not done is actually win over voters. Trust in Tony Blair has collapsed, but that is prompting a backlash against all mainstream politicians, not enthusiasm for Howard. One year later, recent polls reveal that nearly one Tory in five would rather see Blair in Downing Street than his own party: Blair scores higher than Howard on both competence and being 'in touch' - and highest of all among potential Tory swing voters. </p> <p>Stephan Shakespeare of YouGov, the party's former pollsters, says they are no longer flatlining in the polls: it's worse than that. 'You would normally be expecting a rising curve going into the next election to get in reach of the target,' he says. 'The fact it has stayed where it is means they are, in reality, going backwards.' </p> <p><b>Party troubles</b><br> </p> <p>No wonder the mood, as the party faithful gather in Bournemouth, is queasy, not least among Tory MPs with knife-edge majorities. 'There will be fluttering in the dovecotes over this,' says one veteran frontbencher, ominously. 'Conference is going to be difficult.' </p> <p>Howard will try to calm his restive party - as Blair did his last week - by lowering the temperature. He will not, frontbenchers insist, be panicked into offering specific tax cuts, although Oliver Letwin, the shadow Chancellor, will send broad signals. </p> <p>And there will be no overblown rhetoric, no 'big ideas': just small, practical policies, with a promise that ministers who fail to deliver them will be fired. The Tories hope this will reassure a new breed of floating voter, convinced grandiose political promises cannot be trusted. </p> <p>'How many big ideas have we had from Blair? \"A thousand days for a thousand years\"; \"the young country\"; \"the giving age\"; \"healing the scars of Africa\",' says David Cameron, formerly Howard's special adviser and now his shadow cabinet policy co-ordinator. 'People are fed up with politicians grandstanding.' </p> <p>The task instead, as chairman Liam Fox will tell the conference tomorrow, is for the Tories to prove that 'political parties are not all the same'. </p> <p>The risk, however, is that such low-key language will be drowned out in a cacophony of conflicting advice from the sidelines, with right-wingers demanding more Euro-scepticism to prevent Ukip defectors. Can Howard stick to his course? </p> <p><b>Whiff of panic</b><br> </p> <p>The word that Howard's political admirers use most often of him is 'decisive'. 'He is very focused on what he wants to achieve; he doesn't brook diversions,' says Andrew Lansley, his shadow health secretary. Cameron argues Howard is more sure of himself now than he ever was as Home Secretary: 'He seems more calm, more measured.' </p> <p>In Central Office, however, there is a whiff of panic. The first sign came with an interview published in the anti-war New Statesman last Thursday - the day Hartlepool went to the polls - in which Howard directly accused Blair of lying over Iraq, a charge even Charles Kennedy has avoided. </p> <p>Howard voted for the war, and still supports it: like John Kerry, the Democratic presidential candidate whose 'flip flopping' on Iraq has damaged him, was he now jumping belatedly on the anti-war bandwagon? Opponents scented blood. </p> <p>'It's a desperate attempt to seize ground that we're occupying,' says an indignant Tim Razzall, the Lib Dem campaign manager. Downing Street, too, is preparing to exploit Howard's inconsistencies on Iraq, believing the public will resent any breaking of ranks when British troops are still under fire. </p> <p>There may trouble, too, on his own side. Duncan Smith - who received intelligence briefings in the run-up to the invasion and believes Blair acted correctly - is understood to be seeking pledges in Howard's speech this week that the Tories will not dilute support for the war. </p> <p><b>The Ukip threat</b><br> </p> <p>The second warning sign came on the eve of polling, when the party took out a full-page advert in Hartlepool's evening paper declaring its opposition to the euro, the European Constitution and a federal superstate - all of which was calculated to appeal to Ukip defectors. </p> <p>'I thought that was desperate,' says Page, who says this was the point at which he realised his party could beat the Tories. Ukip rubbed salt in the wounds at its own annual conference in Bristol, with a 'victory' dinner for 200 of the faithful last night. </p> <p>However Howard's aides insist there will be no lurch to the right on Europe this week and that there is no evidence such a move would attract the floating vote Howard needs - and Kennedy is already getting. A poll for last week's Economist found that, while 25 per cent of voters would be more likely to vote Tory if Howard pledged to pull out of Europe, a third said it would make no difference as they 'would not vote Tory anyway'. </p> <p><b>Keep buggering on</b><br> </p> <p>Andrew Mackay knows a bit about Ukip supporters: the deputy party chairman's own son, Hamish, voted for them in the European elections, 'because he wanted to give us a bloody nose'. Hamish will be voting for his father at the next general election, and Mackay - who is in charge of target seats - believes most of those 'protest-voting' Ukip will follow: 'I think Ukip's bubble will burst.' </p> <p>His optimism is backed by polling carried out in 130 of the Labour-held seats he oversees. It found the Tories have reversed Labour's lead in the battleground for the next election. </p> <p>'They're full of traditional Tory voters who were rather taken with Blair and voted for him in 1997, and now they feel let down,' he said. Crucially, Labour won many of these seats thanks only to tactical voting by Lib Dem voters, who may not help out again. For months, Mackay has been pushing Howard's claim that Blair lied over Iraq. </p> <p>Could these tentative green shoots of Tory revival be real? Even if not, there is no appetite among demoralised MPs for another leadership coup with a general election so close: they accept not much can be done beyond - as Soames himself put it - 'KBO' [Keep Buggering On]. </p> <p>Even the voters seem confused about what they would prefer: the top choice in the Economist's poll of potential leaders was not any of five senior Tories, but 'someone younger' - a sign that they believe the Tories' Blair, someone who can rescue the party, has not yet emerged. </p> <p>However, a bad result could prompt a leadership contest, probably between David Davis and Liam Fox on the right and Letwin, Lansley or Damian Green, the recently deposed shadow education secretary, on the moderate wing. Sir Malcolm Rifkind, due to return to Parliament at the next election, is also a contender. Gentle manoeuvring may begin this week. </p> <p><b>It's the voters, stupid</b><br> </p> <p>Shakespeare has a warning for the Conservatives - the experience of three leaders in as many years should teach them that its problem is policies, not people: 'Leaders have far less of an effect than we normally give credit for.' </p> <p>Dominic Cummings, former head of strategy at Central Office, agrees there is 'no magic bullet', beyond a radical intellectual refreshment of the party. Lack of trust in Blair, he argues, is not enough to guarantee victory: 'Trust in Clinton plummeted after the Lewinsky scandal but his job approval ratings did not.' </p> <p>Lansley accepts that the Tories' first task is getting voters to trust politicians again, but argues a centralising platform of free-market economics, social tolerance and a gentle scepticism about the EU could prove a vote-winner: </p> <p>'The 20, 30, 40-somethings who are at the heart of those the Conservative Party has to win over - that's the way they approach life now.' </p> <p>What they are not doing, yet, is approaching the Conservative Party. </p> <p><b>Two sides of Michael Howard:</b></p> <p><b>Soft cop:</b> </p> <p>'We are all crew on what at its best is the most superb campaigning vessel politics has ever known.' <b>Howard on being made leader of the Conservative Party, November 2003 </b> </p> <p>'It was a bold and brave experiment but it didn't work, it was a mistake, I've apologised for it before and I'm happy to do so again.' <b>On the poll tax, December 2003</b> </p> <p>'One of the worst ways in which people are denied control over their own lives.

  "When Melvyn Bragg blurted out that Tony Blair 'nearly did go and call it a day' in the spring because of 'personal and family' pressures, he may have been betraying a confidence or speaking off the top of his head, but he was revealing no more than an indisputable truth that everything in British politics still centres on the Prime Minister. <p>He may be battered. He may be routinely accused of lying - as if he knew Saddam Hussein had no weapons and decided he could get away with covering up because, hell, no one would notice once the war was over. But we're still a monarchical country, and all that those who matter in political London can think about is the monarch, his family, his health and his whims. </p> <p>The King's heart flutters and the palace trembles. Courtiers huddle in corners, their eyes flicking over each others' shoulders to check for traitors. When they're sure they're safe, they mutter that the King's health is weak and the people who once adored him are crying that his mind is weaker still. Can he carry on? Can he win again? </p> <p>The New Labour dynasty has many aims but one purpose: to hold on to power at any price. The country has a Chancellor who is almost as powerful as the King. Could he replace him? Legions of difficulties assail the courtiers as soon as the seditious thought is whispered. The peasants of southern England are a fickle and greedy rabble. They may say they trust the Chancellor now, but he is a foreigner, and his strange morality is alien to them. The courtiers can't help but worry about their own places at court, for the Chancellor has courtiers of his own. Other barons want the throne, they reflect. Can the Chancellor take it without factionalism, chaos, civil war? But if he is denied the throne, will he rebel and ferment a civil war of his own? </p> <p>What to do? The King says there is nothing to do because he will stay on the throne for another five years. Why, then, has he bought a great house in a garden square? Does he mean what he says? Or does he plan to retire to his estate? </p> <p>And what of the Queen? Bragg was right on one point: the opinion of the royal family matters. If she wants her husband to stay, he will. If she says go, he will listen. Does she think her husband's policies make the stress and the insults worth bearing? Or, to put the question bluntly: if she wasn't married to the leader of the Labour Party would she vote Lib Dem at the next election? </p> <p>As befits a monarchical country, the political books publishers like best are personal accounts of the machinations at the top. Robin Cook, John Prescott, Alastair Campbell and Cherie Blair have one biography each. Gordon Brown and Peter Mandelson have two. Tony Blair has five. The last two have just been released and couldn't be more different. </p> <p>Anthony Seldon's is a huge piece of work. He's careful before he criticises the Prime Minister, but his sources are very hard on Cherie Blair. The adoption of her husband's name is the giveaway, they say. She has gone from being Cherie Booth, the brilliant lawyer and radical barrister, to Cherie Blair, the Prime Ministerial consort obsessed with celebrities, fashion and New Age quackery. Francis Beckett's and David Hencke's biography is shorter and tougher and reaches the opposite conclusion. It's hard on the Prime Minister but goes easy on his wife. There has been no Jekyll-and-Hyde transformation from Ms Booth into Mrs Blair. She remains what she always was: Cherie Booth, a passionate defender of human rights. </p> <p>Beckett and Henke assert that she privately opposed the Iraq war. It seems a reasonable inference. Her law firm Matrix Chambers produced an opinion which claimed the war was illegal and is now supporting the constitutionally illiterate campaign to impeach Blair - a stance which must make potential clients wonder about paying through the nose for its services. But after the Beckett and Henke biography book went to press, its subject told the Telegraph that her husband's Iraq policy had her unequivocal support. When I checked with one of their sources, he said that his best guess was that she was torn: should she support American adventurism, or should she recommend leaving one of the worst tyrants on earth in power? </p> <p>It's impossible to know who is telling the truth. But if you put her views in March last year to one side, it's clear that she must abhor the war on terror. You don't have to decide whether you can trust the anonymous sources before reaching this conclusion. You just have to read what she says. </p> <p>Her best legal work has been as a supporter of the movement to limit national sovereignty which swept the world after the collapse of communism. The nation state must no longer be allowed to abuse human rights with impunity. UN courts and European Conventions of Human Rights must limit its power to do as it wishes. If General Pinochet was caught wondering through London's grander stores, he should be arrested and made to account for his many crimes. The British state could no longer get away with using 'national security' as a catch-all justification for the denial of liberty. </p> <p>If she wasn't married to the Prime Minister, it's easy to imagine her standing up before the Law Lords to denounce his government's determination to intern Arab terrorist suspects without charge or trial on secret evidence which may have been obtained by torturers. </p> <p>Last year she went public to question George W Bush's refusal to allow Ameri can's to face charges of committing crimes against humanity before the International Criminal Court. The court was a 'shining example', she said, which made the best human rights aspirations of the post-war world come true. In his debate with John Kerry last week, George W Bush dismissed the court as 'a body based in The Hague where unaccountable judges and prosecutors could pull our troops, our diplomats up for trial'. </p> <p>Precious little common ground there. </p> <p>Tony Blair is no respecter of the Treaty of Westphalia and the sovereign immunity of nation states it confers, as his willingness to take on the organisers of mass slaughters from Belgrade to Baghdad shows. But Britain has been no more willing to put pressure on the US to sign-up to the International Criminal Court than it has been ready to demand that Guantanamo Bay be brought under the rule of law. I don't think it's hyperbolic to guess that Ms Booth must shudder whenever she hears a report from Guantanamo. If she doesn't, she is making a nonsense of her life. </p> <p>There are aspects of Tony Blair's domestic policy that must also make her cringe. Not all of it, by any means. One of the paradoxes of the times is that at the very moment when the liberal-left intelligentsia has decided that Blair is a mendacious sell-out, he has come up with a passably radical programme for his third term. You can easily imagine his promise at last week's conference to help mothers and children delighting his wife. </p> <p>Yet the better side of the government's programme is obscured by its desperate attempt to hang on to working-class voters by running on a law-and-order ticket. In the Birmingham, Coventry and Hartlepool by-elections, Labour could think of nothing else to talk about. In Hartlepool the Liberal Democrat candidate, a decent lawyer, rather like Cherie Booth, had the most ridiculous accusations thrown at her: that she was a friend of junkies; that she wanted to 'let child killers out of jail'; that she would 'give teen criminals social workers not court cases.' </p> <p>Such rhetoric has led to a near-doubling of the prison population since Cherie's husband became Labour's home affairs spokesman in the early 1990s. Earlier this year in The Observer she denounced the system he presided over for trapping women prisoners in a 'cycle of poverty and crime'. Once again, the common ground is hard to find. </p> <p>Obviously one can make too much of this, and I probably have. I'm sure Cherie Booth is determined that her husband's Prime Ministerial career won't end in a humiliating resignation, and every Westminster correspondent says that she has urged him to resist Gordon Brown's attempts to force him out of 10 Downing Street. </p> <p>For all that, her husband's foreign policy is tied to defending the abuses of American power while his domestic policy panders to the worst instincts of wavering voters. Does she ever wonder if the New Labour game is worth the candle? There are a lot of women like her who have decided that it isn't.</p>",
  "<p>The assertion that America is a brand might be surprising at first. We too readily associate brands with consumer products. Yet for tourism and inward investment purposes at the very least, as well as for 'public diplomacy', countries and cities all around the world are defining what makes them distinctive - and marketing themselves as brands. </p> <p>A new book, Brand America, by Simon Anholt and Jeremy Hildreth, will not only convince you of the serious intent behind this but will also make you realise that America is, as the book's subtitle puts it, the mother of all brands. Indeed, when you look at it properly it is a consumer product, even if you cannot buy it in a packet from a supermarket shelf. </p> <p>There are two common misconceptions about brands. First that a brand is purely about visuals - a logo, colours and imagery. Second, that branding is a 20th-century invention. Of course the visual imagery of the American brand is powerful: the Stars and Stripes, the presidential seal, the Statue of Liberty are iconic and recognised in every corner of the world. And there's no doubt that in the 20th and 21st centuries we have become more and more accustomed to the management of visual symbolism to create emotional effects. </p> <p>While such visual branding has always worked for the US, Anholt and Hildreth's book goes deeper, to the ideas that have informed Brand America. See, for example, that the Declaration of Independence, written by Thomas Jefferson and others in 1776, is the starting point. Think of the way words have represented American ideas and built a worldwide consciousness of its values in a continuing line that takes in things as diverse as the Gettysburg address, the broadcaster Voice of America and the lyrics of Bruce Springsteen. Perhaps the only question is whether this is a brand that has somehow just happened or has been consciously managed. Springsteen himself might point us to the answer by showing how awareness of the brand lives inside every American. A few months ago he wrote about the presidential election: 'This is the most critical election of my life. Basic issues of America's identity are at stake.' </p> <p>Of course, that is why the definition and meaning of the American brand exercises us all at this moment. Which expression of Brand America will dominate the world for the next four years? Bush or Kerry? Polls outside the US show that we would all like a say in an event that might affect us more than our own national politics - and just about every country in the world prefers Kerry's version of America to Bush's. </p> <p>We need to see the American brand in its historical context, and Anholt and Hildreth make clear that America has always seen itself, and managed itself, as a brand. It has dominated a marketplace for ideas, culture, influence and respect, and it has traded in this marketplace through its commercial brands. Its continuing dominance of the world's most valuable business sectors - entertainment, merchant banking and IT, for example - mean that the national and commercial brands reinforce each other. </p> <p>But this could change. Indeed it is changing, with rising anti-Americanism throughout the world. The core values of Brand America, freedom and wealth, have become more common commodities. The dream has faded. America is no longer the aspirational beacon for all those who yearn for lives of greater freedom and wealth. It's hard for many inside the US to realise this as they resort to ever-greater stridency in their proclamations of 'enduring freedom' while narrowing the parameters of acceptability for opposing ideas. The brand of the free receives a cynical reception in the rest of the world, particularly when television images can daily show negative aspects of Brand America's imposition of the liberty it now offers. </p> <p>If you're no longer an aspirational brand, you need to try harder. But at this crucial time America seems to have forgotten what it means to be a brand. The synergy of culture, brands, companies, policy, people and media has dissipated. There's an absence of co-ordination between purpose, ideology and message. </p> <p>Instead, as the sole superpower in a new world order, America has forgotten how it achieved brand leadership when there was greater competitiveness between national brands. American companies - in tune with their national brand - had realised that clarity of purpose and message mattered above all. They understood the need for sensitivity towards different audiences. They knew the value of attractive positioning and ethical behaviour, even if they have not always lived up to it. And America's commercial brands still lead the world, accounting for 64 of the world's most valuable 100, because it takes time to lose such a dominant position. But there are danger signals for American brands in the decline of Brand America. </p> <p>Anholt and Hildreth advocate branding as an inherently peaceful and humanistic approach to international relations, because it is based on competition, consumer choice and consumer power. As such it is closely linked to principles of individual freedom and power, far more likely to lead to world peace than statecraft based on territory, economic power, ideologies, politics or religion. They show, too, that brand analysis, because it embraces both emotional and intellectual arguments, has a particular power to put America under a searching spotlight. </p> <p>So where does that leave Brand America now? Arguably in need of a new brand promise, or at least a new definition of the brand's essence; searching for a new approach to public diplomacy, while needing the equivalent of a Marshall Plan to set about the task of rebuilding. But the answer, as with many commercial brands under threat, lies not in the ruthless discarding of the values that have got America to this point but in finding new and relevant ways to express them. That is the real issue at the heart of the presidential debate.</p> <p><strong>Their stars in our eyes</strong></p> <p>We have all grown up in a time and place heavily influenced by American culture. Significant Americans (they almost demand to be called icons) have dominated our lives: Humphrey Bogart and Marilyn Monroe in films (or do we talk about movies and Hollywood?); Elvis Presley and Bob Dylan in music; John F Kennedy and Martin Luther King in politics and public life. Go back or skip forward a few generations and the names of the icons are different, but the point still holds. </p> <p><strong>Born in the USA</strong></p> <p>More than any other country, America has benefited from the positive power of its commercial brands. For example, Coca-Cola, MTV and Levi's in youth lifestyle; Microsoft, Dell, IBM in technology; CNN, Time, Newsweek in information; American Express, Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs in the management of money.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> John Simmons (<a href=\"http://www.thewriter.co.uk\">www.thewriter.co.uk</a>) is editor of 'Great Brand Stories', a paperback series from Cyan Books, exploring some of the world's iconic brands.

The better of the two is the Porter film, Irwin Winkler's <strong> De-Lovely</strong>, chiefly because there are a couple of dozen songs here by one of the greatest composer-lyricists of all time. </p> <p>Fundamentally, De-Lovely is like one of those songbook stage shows built around an artist's oeuvre. These have been a theatrical staple for the past 30-odd years (one called Cole ran for a couple of years in the 1970s), in which the numbers are linked by thin slices of biography. </p> <p>The narrative device follows It's a Wonderful Life, Carousel and the John Belushi biopic, Wired, by having an angel conduct the subject on a review of his life, in this case, a suave Gabriel (aka 'Gabe', played by Jonathan Pryce) with the elderly wheelchair-borne Cole Porter (Kevin Kline). </p> <p>Unlike the better 1946 biopic, Night and Day, starring Cary Grant, this one makes a big point of the bisexuality that made problems for his marriage to the long-suffering Linda (Ashley Judd). Apart from Kline and Judd, the cast is entirely British. </p> <p>The film lumbers over a period of some 46 years, from 1918 to 1964, but there is no reference to the two world wars or the Depression, and only the cars mark the passage of time and social change. The songs, attractively arranged by Stephen Endelman, are mostly used thematically, not chronologically, and where they're not sung by Kline, they're performed by a variety of youngish singing stars, including Natalie Cole, Elvis Costello and Robbie Williams. Only Sheryl Crow's 'Begin the Beguine' struck me as a dud, though it's never been a favourite of mine. </p> <p>Stephen Hopkins's <strong> The Life and Death of Peter Sellers</strong> is a largely unfunny film about a very funny man. The only really laugh-out-loud sequence comes on a plane trip to Rome, during which Sellers (Geoffrey Rush) decides on his interpretation of Inspector Clouseau and proceeds to inflict it on a stewardess and fellow passengers. The film follows Sellers from his radio stardom with The Goons in the early 50s (staggeringly unfunny) up to his penultimate screen appearance in Being There, a portrait of a man with no real identity, which he regarded as the peak of his career. </p> <p>Presented as a victim of an overbearing mother constantly condemning her husband as a failure, Sellers comes over as an egotistical child, wilful, self-deceiving, and only real when engaged in impersonation. The film's central device is to have Sellers looking at this film of his life. Between takes during its shooting, he assumes the roles of his first wife, his mother, father, Stanley Kubrick and Blake Edwards, rewriting their scripts to present himself in a better light. </p> <p>In addition, Rush also plays Sellers in brief extracts from some of his most famous pictures - the young crook in The Ladykillers, the duchess in The Mouse That Roared, Dr Strangelove, US President Muffly, Clouseau and others. His performance is a tour de force in an otherwise negligible, pompous picture that casts no fresh light on Sellers or his times. </p> <p>San Francisco-based heavy metal band Metallica formed in 1981, have sold millions of albums and were once nicknamed 'Alcoholica' for the booze and drugs they downed. Two of the founders are still there, one was kicked out, one was killed in a road accident on tour in Sweden and one left to do his own thing in 2001. </p> <p>The documentary <strong> Metallica: Some Kind of Monster</strong>, over which the band exercised complete editorial control, was made over two years during which they worked on their first album of this century and then embarked on their first tour since the 1990s. The picture is like This Is Spinal Tap for real, an unintentionally hilarious excursion into the lives of a group of self-regarding, inarticulate, constantly warring rock artists. </p> <p>What makes Metallica especially amusing is that a lot of it centres on the band's sessions with a therapist who calls himself a 'performance-enhancement coach', hired by the group's management to help resolve personal and professional discords. He was paid $40,000 a month and spent more than two years with them. His name is Phil Towle, though it might well have been 'Flannel'. Had Hemingway's celebrated 'built-in bullshit detector' been put in front of this movie it would have been chattering away like a Geiger counter at Chernobyl. </p> <p>Kerry Conran's <strong> Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow</strong> is a retro-SF adventure yarn of a sub- Indiana Jones sort, in which virtually everything we see, except for the actors, has been digitally created. With relish, but without much irony, it begins in 1939 Manhattan where a Zeppelin is moored atop the Empire State Building, The Wizard of Oz is playing at Radio City Music Hall, and a mad German called Totenkopf (played by a hologram version of Laurence Olivier) has embarked upon the destruction of the world, launching an attack against New York using giant iron birds and robots. </p> <p>Only Polly Perkins, ace reporter on the New York Chronicle (Gwyneth Paltrow) and her boyfriend, intrepid British aviator, Sky Captain (Jude Law), can save us. Faced with this mind-boggling threat, the pair go monde-Biggling around the globe in his amphibious fighter plane, taking in Shangri-La and other spots. The designs come from Things to Come, King Kong, the lurid artwork of pulp science-fiction magazines of the 1930s, as well as B-feature space serials. It's technically brilliant, but as far as I'm concerned the Buck Rogers stops here. </p> <p>James Wan's <strong> Saw</strong> is a horror-thriller that's like Seven seen from the point of view of the serial killer's victims. A photographer (the film's co-writer, Leigh Whannell) and a cancer surgeon (Cary Elwes) wake up to find themselves chained to the wall at either end of a grimy, white-tiled subterranean washroom. </p> <p>They've been abducted and are at the mercy of a brilliant ludic lunatic who plays painful games with them, from which only one can emerge alive. A flashback reveals that he's known to the press as 'Jigsaw', a serial killer with a warped personal agenda. The twists are astonishing, the pain palpable, and Wan almost dares us to walk out before the eponymous tool is put to use. Not for the fainthearted who, like William's girlfriend, Violet Elizabeth, will squeam and squeam until they're sick. </p> <p><strong> Layer Cake</strong> is a flashy, way-above-average British gangster movie with an excellent performance from Daniel Craig as a middle-management drug dealer. On the point of getting out, he gets in much deeper by becoming involved in the violent machinations of Serbian manufacturers of ecstasy based in Amsterdam, big-time British hoodlums with connections in Canary Wharf, and Merseyside's gangsters. It's the directorial debut of Matthew Vaughn, and much superior to Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch, which he produced. </p> <p><strong> Mambo Italiano</strong> is yet another raucous ethnic comedy about someone trying to break away from family restrictions, in the manner of Moonstruck and Wedding Banquet (the top end of the sub-genre) and My Big Fat Greek Wedding (the bottom end). The hero here is a young gay man from Montreal's La Petite Italie living with his policeman partner and wanting to come out of the armoire. Crude, sentimental, wildly overacted. </p> <p>Made by two Australian philosophers-turned-moviemakers, <strong> The Ister</strong> is a stimulating three-hour journey in time, space and the mind. They take us up the Danube from the Black Sea to Germany looking at life, art, politics, history and other things through the prism of a lecture given in 1942 by the Nazi-sympathising intellectual Martin Heidegger on a poem by Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin. </p> <p>Rebecca O'Brien, the producer of six Ken Loach movies, has moved into a rather different area with the Anglo-German-Italian <strong> Princesa</strong>, a film about a Brazilian transvestite working as a prostitute in Milan to pay for a sex-change operation. Directed by Henrique Goldman, a Brazilian based in London, it's an oddity, honest yet faintly exploitative. </p> <p>Unlike Neil Jordan's The Crying Game, the central character, a far from ingratiating figure, is played by a woman, the 19-year-old Ingrid de Souza. </p> <p><strong> Open Water</strong> (15) <br>Low-budget high-tension thriller in which a yuppie couple go scuba-diving and end up on the menu for a fish dinner. </p> <p><strong> Collateral</strong> (15) <br>Michael Mann helps Tom Cruise get nasty as a hit man having a hard day's night in LA. </p> <p><strong> Ae Fond Kiss</strong> (15) <br>The title is from Burns, the plot from Romeo and Juliet , the setting is Glasgow and Ken Loach is in a mellow mood. </p> <p><strong>The Motorcycle Diaries</strong> (15) <br>Idealistic 23-year-old Che Guevara travels around Latin America Easy Rider -style. </p> <p><strong> Dead Man's Shoes </strong> (18) Paddy Considine shines in his friend Shane Meadows's thriller about a revenge trip in the English Midlands.</p>",
  "<p>After John Thaw, best known as television's Inspector Morse, died of cancer on 21 February 2002, Sheila Hancock, who had been married to him for 28 years, wrote in her diary: 'He was my whole life. Everything was in reference to him. Without him, I don't exist. I can't bear this crippling pain. I can't write it down.' But she has, since then, succeeded in writing it down. Her honest, graceful account leaves nothing out - Thaw's alcoholism, his depression, their separation, their love. The Two of Us - My Life with John Thaw is published on Wednesday. </p> <p>Sheila Hancock's face smiles down on Liverpool, her eyebrows raised as high as they will go. In the poster above the Playhouse Theatre, she is larger than life and all celebration - a tilted glass of champagne in one hand, a cigarette holder in the other. Her ash blonde hair is short and sexy, her earrings incredible - like baroque foliage. It is a theatrical mask; it's unbelievable that she is 70. Tom Stoppard once described Hancock as a 'tired chrysanthemum who could put on a cruel blue look that could freeze a hummingbird to an oven door'. Decode that if you can. But her eyes do stop you in your tracks: exclamatory and ageless. It is typical of the woman she is that she can play a monstrous merry widow (in Bill MacIlwraith's The Anniversary ) with such fizz in the same week that her raw, stirring book is published. </p> <p>I met her on a grey afternoon in a flat I almost needed Morse's help to find. In a sense, Sheila Hancock does not want to be found. She is 'hiding away' fighting a cold - Beecham's Powders at the ready - and worrying about her book. I first met her years ago and liked her greatly then. And whatever she was actually feeling (bloody awful, I suspect), she could not have been nicer on reacquaintance. Nor, in her fresh, flowery shirt - mauve and pink and cream - did she look less like the vulgar widow she brilliantly plays. But faces carry their recent history and there was a new sadness in her eyes. How could there not be? </p> <p>During John Thaw's last illness, Sheila Hancock bargained with the devil. She would give up wealth (Thaw, she joked, would not approve), her career and die in agony to keep him alive. But the devil wasn't listening. And Sheila hadn't been on speaking terms with God since her mother and first husband, actor Alec Ross, died. (By the grimmest of coincidences, Ross and Thaw each died of cancer of the oesophagus.) </p> <p>He never admitted he was dying. Four days before his death, Sheila recorded: 'John spent the morning choosing the colours and extras for his new Jag and discussing whether he should sign up for another year with Carlton. My heart is breaking.' And after a meeting with a 'palliative care man' who was 'utterly honest' with him, John turned to Sheila and said: 'Well, that all sounded very positive, didn't it, kid?' Hancock secretly met his doctor, urging him to be straight. 'But the doctor told me, \"I am sorry, he just doesn't want to hear it and you have no right to make him treat it any other way.\"' Now she sees the courage in John's attitude, even though denial was never her thing. </p> <p>After John's death, she longed for a book that could 'honestly tell me how ghastly grief is'. She has tried to write the book she wanted to read: 'I would have loved to read about somebody else, to realise I was behaving normally, not going mad.' She was 'consumed' with grief. An 'avalanche' of letters arrived. Most were 'mourning Morse'. They were not about John Thaw at all. There were condolences from people as various as a nun and a National Car Parks attendant. More alarmingly, she received a letter from a writer proposing a 'warts and all' biography, to go ahead without her approval, if necessary. </p> <p>She knew what this meant. John's alcoholism was not public knowledge. She took advice and was told she should 'put a rumour around' to publishers that she was planning to write a book herself. She had tried to persuade John to write about himself but his reply was: 'Oh, nobody would be interested in me, kid.' </p> <p>Sheila Hancock researched John's life as if he were a stranger and became engrossed: 'I almost forgot it was John,' She found out about his working-class childhood in Manchester (she grows up beside him, in alternate chapters, in her own happier working-class family in King's Cross, London and suburban Bexleyheath, Kent). Sheila and John's parallel lives continue as they get into Rada (at different times). Sheila describes John's hilarious audition as Richard III in a teddy boy suit. 'Mercifully,' she reflected, 'the panel had been shrewd enough to see the potential of the strange lad.' </p> <p>John was a strange lad, known in the neighbourhood as 'the boy with the grey vest and no underpants'. He had a coconut of which he was inexplicably fond. But he had reason to be unusual. His mother had walked out on him and his brother when he was seven. 'He was polluted by what happened to him all his life.' He never forgave his mother. Sheila has more than forgiven her. She has tried to understand her. Oddly, it was seeing John's mother's furniture that was the breakthrough. Sheila's voice became excited as she recalled: 'It was when I saw these two shiny, garish cocktail cabinets. And a terrible converted lamp with a gold silk shade. I thought, I know this woman. This woman was John. This woman was a star. And life shat on her. She was all alone in a godawful house with two whining kids. She thought she could go off with this glitzy guy - because she was sparky, full of life. I could see where she was coming from. I thought I must put in a word for her somehow.' </p> <p>She is a great defender, Sheila. A protester, too. She describes having a go at Tony Blair in the book. And she winces like a schoolgirl when I remind her of tigerishly assailing newspaper photographers in a post office who were trying to snap John Thaw during his last days. She has a crusading streak, too (she runs - and pours her earnings into - the John Thaw Foun dation, a charity for young people who need 'a helping hand'.) </p> <p>But her book is not protective at the expense of truth. She wants to set the record straight and that means untwining Thaw and Morse. Morse was an intellectual; Thaw wasn't. Thaw had an amazing sense of humour; Morse didn't. But Morse and Thaw had some things in common: 'Shyness and a love of music. Like Morse, John had an awkwardness with women - because of what his mother did.' Both were workers; Thaw, at times, was a workaholic, always worrying about where the next job was coming from. Thaw loved the good life that Morse paid for - his houses (in London, Wiltshire and France), his swimming pool. Sheila does not need to add that Morse liked a drink, Thaw needed one. The little black bag he carried everywhere was full of vodka bottles. </p> <p>John met Sheila co-starring in a play called So What About Love? He was grumpy, she was not impressed. But he found a charming way of letting her know he meant to be her friend. When her mother was diagnosed with cancer - the prognosis bad - John sat her down, put headphones on her head and played her Simon and Garfunkel's 'Bridge Over Troubled Water'. He would become her bridge. And she his. </p> <p>When they married, they each had a daughter. Melanie was Sheila's by her first marriage, Abigail was John's. Together, they had a third, Joanna, when Sheila was 42. All three women are actresses. 'I have run the book past the girls - Jo particularly finds it very difficult.' But it was Abigail who criticised an early draft about the alcoholism saying: 'Mum, you have soft-pedalled on this. You should be more honest to show what a miracle it was when Dad came through and also to show how we all suffered.' </p> <p>'Alcoholics are utterly dear one minute,' Sheila elaborated, 'but there is also a blanket hatred with which you cannot reason.' Alcohol was 'a terrible trigger that put John into an appalling decline'. It was a Harley Street doctor, Beauchamp Colclough, an unusual, wild-haired Irishman, who cured him. His therapist had said he was suffering from clinical depression but his moods improved dramatically once he became permanently sober. Alcoholics Anonymous helped Sheila: 'I remember my first meeting. I was distraught, not understanding what was going on in my life. Hearing these people, I thought, my God, other people are like me. This is an illness. I'm not going mad.' It is the second time she has expressed the need to have her feelings echoed. 'I can't do solitude,' she has written. </p> <p>As we talked, there was drilling from the building site next door to her Liverpool flat beyond which the Mersey flowed brown and sluggish. Suddenly, she surprised me by announcing with energy: 'I know how to build a block of flats. I have watched them for hours building the foundations. I've watched bricks being laid, like Lego. I've seen workers sacked. There is always something to engross you in life.' </p> <p>She has become interested in the slow, rowdy drama of it all. She loves cities. She prefers to be 'in the thick of it'. She is 'not one of those people who retire to the country'. She doesn't want to be put out to pasture and can't face Luckington, their beautiful house in Wiltshire. 'I feel John's absence so acutely there. There is nothing in the house that doesn't have a memory. I can only bear it when the grandchildren are there.' She has four: Jack and Lola (Melanie's), Molly-Mae and Talia (Abigail's), and Joanna is expecting a baby in November. She is surprisingly 'all right' in their house in France, which John Thaw adored. But she has sold their London house and moved into a flat in Hammersmith, by the river. 'I am back to my roots. I used to live above a pub [(the Carpenter's Arms in King's Cross]. Now I am near a pub again.' </p> <p>She refuses to be a permanent mourner or a snail. She loves driving Mavis, the Jag John gave her. 'Mavis is glorious, a great joy in my life, very unsuitable.' Recently, she passed an advanced driving test. Why Mavis? It was an 'ordinary' name to 'bring a flash lady down to size'. </p> <p>Unlike Mavis, Sheila needs no downsizing.'I have to say that since John died I feel older. I used to feel extremely attractive and sexy because that's how he saw me. When I look at myself in the mirror now, particularly when I am naked, I think how could he ever have looked at me and still thought I was so dishy? He must have been blind, but he did. Maybe his eyesight was going or something. I think it was because he didn't wear glasses'. </p> <p>She laughs, then sounds serious again. 'But now I am conscious that certain things in my life are over. I will never have another man in my life. Let's be honest, the years of active life I have left are not that many. That is a fact. And I really want to take that on board.' She doesn't like the modern trend of pretending to be younger than we are. She has nothing against cosmetic surgery - it is just that she knows time for what it is. </p> <p>As I leave Liverpool, I stop to look again at her picture above the theatre - such a brave face. Not long ago, a woman asked her: 'Weren't you Sheila Hancock?' She was. She still is. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> Two of Us by Sheila Hancock is published by Bloomsbury at \u00a317.99.

  "<p>George W Bush for President! That might outrage Warren Buffett and George Soros, the wealthy investment philanthropists, but the fact remains that business and Wall Street feel more comfortable with the Republicans than with the rather brittle Democrat alternative. </p> <p>Wednesday's revision of second quarter GDP from 2.8 to 3.3 per cent will have given the flagging economy the boost it has recently been missing. </p> <p>Activity round the shopping malls is a stern reminder of economic progress. Since April, retail stocks have made little progress and since July, when the S&amp;P wobbled, few from this sector have cracked on, except for Target and Sears Roebuck, both having been previously severely trashed. </p> <p>Whoever heads for the White House after 3 November, the retail sector could experience a little renaissance as we move towards Christmas, once the political uncertainty dissipates and provided the economic recovery can be sustained. Or will it? </p> <p>Investors should beware of Wal-Mart, not because Lee Scott's supermarket chain is not in a league of its own, but because of its share buyback plan and Wal-Mart's re-weighting in the S&amp;P. There will probably be only one more quarter percentage point increase in official US interest rates before Christmas - to 2 per cent. </p> <p>That pre-emptive strike should have little effect on shopping. Rates are still historically low and in no way can an inconsequential hike be considered punitive when measured against the UK and Europe.</p>",
  "<p>You probably hadn't realised that the world's fifth-largest finance centre was blown to smithereens last month. But discretion is a way of life for Grand Cayman, which ranks behind only New York, London, Tokyo and Hong Kong in the enormity of its bank deposits. This tiny island in the Caribbean doesn't like to draw attention to itself - even when Hurricane Ivan comes calling. </p> <p>Winds of 150 miles per hour buffeted the Cayman Islands on 13 September, leaving the British dependent territory without electricity, telephones or running water for days, and wreaking a path of devastation that left large areas flooded and up to half of all dwellings uninhabitable. Early evening curfews were imposed as angry residents complained that the authorities were playing down the scale of the disaster in an attempt to reassure international investors. </p> <p>Cayman - whose 45,000 residents are outnumbered by the number of brass-plate companies registered there - has certainly been quick to allay fears that its shattered infrastructure could disrupt the all-important finance industry. </p> <p>Emphasising that the sector's assets - 'pretty much electronic money' - were intact and sustained by backup computer servers, Eduardo Silva, president of the Cayman Bankers Association, insisted all would soon be back to normal. 'The message is, the island is open for business, though not 100 per cent.' </p> <p>Even so, Silva was one of many to take refuge in nearby Florida shortly before the hurricane hit. </p> <p>And Grand Cayman has more to worry about than the weather. John Kerry, Democrat challenger in this year's US presidential race, has blamed the island for America's tax evasion problem, and Cayman's lucrative status as the world's leading offshore tax haven is under threat. </p> <p>That status has been hard won. Cayman, a self-governing territory, first began to develop its offshore industry in the Sixties, when - like Jersey, Bermuda, and Gibraltar - it was encouraged by London to find new ways of becoming self-sufficient. Taxes were set at virtually zero, and disclosure requirements were minimal: in effect, companies and bank accounts could be owned anonymously. </p> <p>Such a regime inevitably lent itself to large numbers of embarrassing frauds. BCCI's international arm had its headquarters in Grand Cayman, far from the prying eyes of robust investigators, and Enron used 'special purpose entities' on the island to hide its massive debts. Cayman was even the setting for sinister goings-on in John Grisham's financial thriller The Firm. </p> <p>The island's authorities do not welcome this notoriety and consistently warn money-launderers to stay away. But the truth is that Cayman's reputation for banking secrecy has been a magnet for clean and dirty money alike. It now plays host to 600 banks sitting on about $1 trillion in deposits; its investment managers look after an additional $200 billion; and the island is also a major centre for the captive insurance market. </p> <p>Alongside the institutions, a wealthy class of financiers, lawyers and company agents has grown up, many of them expat Brits and Americans. Throw in the island's natural attractions - it is one of the world's premier scuba-diving spots - and you have a well-heeled paradise. </p> <p>So it was striking to see TV footage of those same expats after Hurricane Ivan, shocked and shivering amid the rubble of their seafront homes, and queuing for rations at makeshift food huts. </p> <p>Damage of more than $1 billion was caused but when a BBC News crew tried to film the aftermath, they were at first denied access by the authorities. </p> <p>'Our machinery has not been enough to open doors totally to the international media,' Bruce Dinwiddy, Cayman's governor, said in explanation. </p> <p>The island insists it is not trying to play down the devastation, pointing out that its chief minister is flying to London to discuss the emergency with ministers and Whitehall officials this week. </p> <p>Still, it all rather begs the question: won't all those traumatised profession als be tempted to relocate to other sun-kissed tax havens, where air-conditioned offices and five-star conference centres still exist? </p> <p>After all, several Cayman-based firms evacuated their staff ahead of the hurricane and successfully continued to run their operations from branches in other tax havens. And Jersey, for one, seems to have spied an opportunity. </p> <p>'There are considerable advantages to being in Jersey in terms of stability - political stability, economic stability, and in terms of global climate change,' said David Carse, head of the Jersey Financial Commission. </p> <p>'It may be difficult at times to get in or out of the island because of fog, but other jurisdictions are in a much more difficult position.' </p> <p>Grand Cayman officials insist that the island's finance sector has suffered no more than a hiccup. Little data has been lost, few of the office buildings in George Town, the island's capital, have been badly damaged, and most basic services such as electricity were restored within a week. Within days of the hurricane the island's Companies Registry was up and running, even open on Saturday to clear the backlog of work. </p> <p>'An almost continuous service was maintained. We are confident this will not effect the running of the finance sector,' Steve John, a spokesman for the island, said yesterday. He added that Cayman was 'extremely grateful' to other jurisdictions for their help. </p> <p>Still, Cayman may soon have to cope with problems of another kind. John Kerry, who led the Senate investigation into BCCI's collapse, is a longstanding critic of tax havens has promised to 'provide middle-class payroll tax relief to get money in the pockets of workers who will spend it, not more tax giveaways for those at the top to stimulate the economy in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda'. </p> <p>On another occasion, he told supporters there were 'enough brass-plate companies down in the Cayman Islands to make anybody in America sick when they look at their own tax bill'. </p> <p>Doubtless some in George Town are praying for a Bush victory in next month's presidential poll. But even a Republican administration may seek to tackle tax flight, given the widely predicted budgetary constraints it will face if re-elected. Bush's government, worried about terrorist funding, has already bullied Cayman and other offshore finance centres into draconian exchange-of-information agreements. </p> <p>There isn't much that a little Caribbean island can do against political pressure of this kind. But despite Kerry and other critics, Cayman can claim with justification to have cracked down on abuse in recent years. The island has signed up to OECD and Financial Action Task Force guidelines, increasing financial supervision and tightening its rules against money laundering and illicit tax flight. </p> <p>The problem with meeting all these international standards, however, is that they make the island less and less easy to differentiate from any other offshore haven. The time may come when Grand Cayman is no longer destination of choice for that most valued customer, the American tax avoider.</p>",
  "It was billed as \"a gladiatorial encounter unique in world politics\". Actually, given its rigid format, there were times when the televised debate between John Kerry and George Bush reminded me of a politicised version of Just A Minute. You felt if Nicholas Parsons, rather than Jim Lehrer, had been in charge Bush would have got hammered for repetition, deviation and hesitation: often in a single sentence. <p>If anything, it was the epic length of the encounter that turned it into some kind of heavyweight contest for a prize purse. </p> <p>On the left, we had the patrician figure of \"Gentleman\" John Kerry: a veteran fighter known for his upright stance but thought to be defensively shaky and incapable of landing a knockout punch. </p> <p>On the right, we had George (\"King Con\") Bush, famed for his deft footwork, over-zealous seconds and legendary capacity to nobble the referee and turn a defeat into a technical victory. In the event it was Kerry who emphatically won, outpointing Bush, by my calculation, in 12 of the 15 rounds. </p> <p>By the end of a punishing, if riveting, fight both looked decidedly groggy. Kerry, by a slip of the tongue, gave the impression he was for, rather than against, nuclear proliferation. And by the final round Bush was so glassy-eyed that, given the chance by Lehrer to defend the charge that he was a liar, he went into auto-pilot attack on Kerry's alleged flip-floppery. </p> <p>Throughout, in fact, Bush's swallowed vowels and slurred speech suggested a faintly punch-drunk old champ; and when he talked of the \"moolahs\" in Iran one wondered whether he was confusing them with the expected moolah to be gained from Iraq. </p> <p>But it was an evening when the contender, rather than the title-holder, had everything to prove; and Kerry, to my surprise, turned out to be nimble in defence and quick in attack. </p> <p>He came out with the best, if clearly well-rehearsed, line of the night when he said that attacking Iraq after 9/11 was \"like Roosevelt invading Mexico in response to Pearl Harbor\". </p> <p>And, when asked what colossal misjudgments Bush had made, he jokingly asked \"Where do you want me to begin?\" With his imposing mass of hair and seamed, Henry Fonda-like features, he even managed to look like a president in waiting. </p> <p>Bush, in contrast, relied heavily on that folksy, down-home manner and sub-John Wayne drawl that has kept him ahead in the polls. But when he claimed \"I don't need anybody to tell me to go to the UN\" you suspect there was a hollow laugh in Downing Street. </p> <p>And too often he seemed both over-rehearsed and badly briefed: he kept repeating his pre-programmed mantras about Kerry's inconsistency, yet often looked as if he was floundering in his 30-second responses. </p> <p>One thing was certainly clear: Alex Jennings's portrayal of him in David Hare's Stuff Happens as a shrewd politician and wise fool now looks unduly flattering. </p> <p>But what do I know? I cringed when Bush, in response to a question about the American soldiers killed in Iraq, talked of his tearful prayers with a bereft war widow; yet a Republican spin doctor described this as an incredible \"risk\" that would play well with the electorate. </p> <p>Equally significant was the moment when Lehrer accidentally referred to 10,052 American lives lost in Iraq before hastily correcting it to 1,052. Had he been speaking of Iraqi lives lost, the former figure might have been more nearly correct. </p> <p>And, to watch the news after the \"gladiatorial\" contest and to see images of a reported 35 children caught in the latest Baghdad crossfire, was to move from the shadow-boxing of a rigidly structured debate into the world of deadly reality.</p>",
  "<p>Cherie Booth's The Goldfish Bowl is \"a readable gallop through the history of five prime-ministerial consorts\", though it is \"unrevealing\" about Cherie, objected Claudia FitzHerbert in the Daily Telegraph. Lesley White in the Sunday Times admired the impartiality of Downing Street staff: \"The Callaghans were fed the same shepherd's pie as they were moving out in 1979 as Mrs T was offered on her arrival that evening.\"</p> <p>In the Independent, Melissa Benn hoped Cherie would reform \"this odd job\" before she leaves. \"Cherie still has to be guarded,\" explained Vanessa Thorpe in the Observer. \"Whenever [she] has spoken out, it rebounds on her horribly.\" \"Who is disappearing through the door of No 10 in the picture on the front cover?\" wondered Mo Mowlam in the Independent on Sunday. \"Could it be Carole Caplin?\"</p> <p>In Philip Roth's The Plot Against America, Roosevelt loses the 1940 election to Charles A Lindbergh, celebrity aviator, isolationist, anti-semite and Hitler fan. Christopher Tayler in the Sunday Telegraph was prompted \"to scour the novel for hidden commentary on recent events\", but concluded that \"it's not that kind of book\", although \"Roth dwells sardonically on Lindbergh's flight suit and laconic public style\", which might remind some readers of a certain president. \"Roth has said quite explicitly that this is not a '9/11 novel',\" observed Erica Wagner in the Times, but it \"casts light on the present through the window of the past.\" David Flusfeder in the Daily Telegraph thought it \"a minor addition to the Roth canon\", although \"Roth's lesser works are better than many others' masterpieces.\"</p> <p>The new 60-volume Dictionary of National Biography costs \u00a37,500, so reviewers had to content themselves with reading it online. \"The new DNB is more unbuttoned than the old,\" noted Piers Brendon in the Independent, and he was pleased to see \"a more representative selection of women, provincials [and] immigrants\" in the entries. \"I squinted hard at these revisions,\" admitted Geoffrey Wheatcroft in the Spectator, \"but they cannot honestly be faulted.\" The publication of the new DNB, he added, \"could almost make you proud to be English again\" - even if, as Richard Lofthouse pointed out in the Financial Times, it \"welcomes deviants, rebels, dissenters and even criminals\". The DNB 's editors \"have created a national monument that is fun\", rejoiced Christopher Howse in the Telegraph. \"Sell the car and buy it.\"</p>"
