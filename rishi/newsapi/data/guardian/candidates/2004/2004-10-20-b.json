  "Let's focus on the realities of deploying a battalion of British infantry to support US forces near Baghdad (Hoon faces growing Iraq revolt, October 19). The US army has wholly inadequate ground forces for the task they have been asked to undertake. But they have approximately 140,000 soldiers in theatre. How much difference can a battalion battle group of 650 men make? <p>The purpose of this request is obvious. First, to provide a figleaf for this wholly illegal war to assist the re-election of the US president. Second, to embroil British forces deeper into the war. It is clear that the UK is yet again being used by the Bush administration as a pawn in its game. How long will parliament permit this manipulation of this country to persist? Perhaps Ukip would care to focus on this as an example of loss of British sovereignty.<br> <b>DJ Browning</b><br> Altrincham, Cheshire<br></p> <p>I am startled by much of the reaction to the proposed redeployment of some UK troops. Are they involved in a separate war from the other members of the alliance, or are they there to assist the Iraqis in ejecting insurgent forces so that they can proceed peacefully towards establishing a democratic government? If it is the latter, there is no question that they should be deployed wherever they are most needed. The support and encouragement our soldiers need to help them to complete the task is pitifully lacking here at home.<br> <b>Colin Bower</b><br> Chelmsford, Essex<br></p> <p>If the Commons does not shortly vote on this new Iraq crisis provoked by the ill-judged US military request, it will give the clearest signal to the already none-too- impressed British electorate that it really is irrelevant. It should vote without delay on a motion to defer an answer to the US until after the presidential election.<br> <b>Peter Draper</b><br> London<br></p> <p>As a US citizen who has lived in Britain, I write to plead with both the British government and people not to give in to the cynical tactic being employed by our president. I am sure you are aware of our much higher casualty rate. One of Kerry's criticisms of Bush's Iraq policy is that he ignores the rest of the world's advice and, possibly because he snubbed some potential allies last year, 90% of the death rate is sustained by the US. Isn't it obvious that Bush's request to send British troops into harm's way now is a blatant attempt to negate Kerry's charge. Your soldiers have done enough to prove the UK is a staunch ally.<br> <b>Eileen Fay</b><br> Kingston, New York, USA<br></p> <p>Why should it be down to America alone to make the \"long-expected full-scale ground assault on Falluja\", which is, according to you, \"believed to be the stronghold of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi's Tawhid wal Jihad group, which killed British hostage Kenneth Bigley\"? Must the Americans do our dirty work for us?<br> <b>Alastair Albright</b><br> London<br> </p> <p>You state that: \"More gruesome has been the talk in some US circles of the need for British troops to \"share more of the load\" (Leaders, October 18). There have been 68 British troops killed compared to 1,062 American. With 138,000 US troops in theatre, they have lost one in 130. With our 8,500, we have lost one in 125.<br> <b>Ian Miller</b><br> Cambridge</p> <p>A loan of 650 British troops is negligible. But this could be the thin end of the wedge. Having agreed to 650, it will be harder to refuse the next request for more.<br> <b> Dr MM Winter</b><br> London<br></p>",
  "The attempt to discredit John Kerry among his fellow Catholics intensified yesterday when a rightwing activist claimed to have Vatican support for his excommunication. <p>The claim, although immediately dismissed by the Vatican authorities, steps up a campaign by conservative Catholics to punish Mr Kerry for his support for abortion rights and stem cell research. </p> <p>He is the first Catholic to seek the presidency since John F Kennedy, and his candidacy has angered rightwing religious forces who see his liberal outlook as a threat. </p> <p>\"Whenever the Democratic party nominates a Catholic it is a godsend, because otherwise the abortion issue is secondary,\" said Father Richard McBrien, a theologian at Notre Dame University. </p> <p>\"If it weren't for Kerry being a Catholic, these people would have no platform.\" </p> <p>The activist, Marc Balestrieri, produced a letter from a Dominican priest in Washington yesterday which he said represented official Vatican support. </p> <p>Mr Balestrieri, who claims to be an expert in canon law and to have served as a consultant to the archdiocese of Los Angeles, has been given a wide hearing in the press, but the archdiocese said yesterday that his service had been limited to ghostwriting a few documents on marriage. </p> <p>The Vatican said he had misrepresented both his contacts with church authorities and the official weight of the letter. </p> <p>Mr Balestrieri, who founded an organisation last June with the express purpose of seeking Mr Kerry's excommunication, was unrepentant. \"It is a mis-statement of the facts,\" he told the Guardian. \"They are covering their backs. They do not want to take responsibility for what is the true teaching of the faith.\" </p> <p>Although Mr Kerry is in no immediate danger of excommunication he can expect intensifying opposition from Catholic conservatives. </p> <p>About a quarter of voters are Catholic and they are heavily represented in battleground states. More than half are believed to support legalised abortion, and the community generally leans towards the Democratic party. </p> <p>But traditionalists have been courted by President George Bush, whose opposition to abortion and stem cell research gives him an advantage with clergy as well as churchgoers, and it will be hard work prising them from the Republican camp, especially since a number of prominent church leaders have voiced their opposition to Mr Kerry. </p> <p>Earlier this year nine bishops said they would deny him communion for his support of abortion rights and on the past two Sundays there have been calls from the pulpit in several battleground states to shun candidates who support abortion rights and stem cell research. </p> <p>\"There is no element of the common good, no morally good practice, that a candidate may promote and to which a voter may be dedicated, which could justify voting for a candidate who also endorses and supports the deliberate killing of the innocent, abortion, embryonic stem-cell research, euthanasia, human cloning or the recognition of a same-sex relationship as legal marriage,\" Raymond Burke, Archbishop of St Louis, Missouri, said in a pastoral letter. </p> <p>The bishops of Newark, Denver and Colorado Springs and clerics in Michigan, Wisconsin and elsewhere have issued similar instructions.</p>",
  "Early voting in the US election has been beset by computer hang-ups, two-hour queues, frayed tempers, and the resignation of at least one election official. <p>Voting ground to a halt in three Florida counties after the laptops used to check voter information stopped connecting to a central database. </p> <p>Many polling locations had only one phone line dedicated to the purpose, and voters reported hi-tech electronic voting machines standing unused while queues formed at the laptops. </p> <p>Early voting, which also began this week in Arkansas, Texas and Colorado, is intended in part to prevent long delays on election day. </p> <p>But in larger Floridian cities, including Miami and Tampa, waits of between two and three hours were reported, causing anger among voters. </p> <p>\"I've been a supervisor for 33 years and this is the worst I've ever seen it,\" Theresa LePore of Palm Beach County, told the South Florida Sun-Sentinel. </p> <p>\"We are going to be doing this for two weeks. But everyone had to show up on the first day, and then complained because they had to stand in line.\" </p> <p>In Florida's most populous county, Duval, the elections supervisor resigned, blaming health problems, while Ms LePore said poll volunteers had also threatened to quit. </p> <p>Duval also succumbed to pressure to open more early-voting sites - just one had been made available - but only after governor Jeb Bush added his voice to criticisms from black church leaders. </p> <p>Mr Bush's secretary of state, Glenda Hood, continues to be embroiled in legal battles with Democrats accusing her office of pursuing policies that could exclude people from voting. </p> <p>Late on Monday the state supreme court awarded Ms Hood a victory when it ruled that provisional ballots, designed to allow the possibility of a vote to those who find themselves missing from the rolls, could only be cast in the voter's home precinct. </p> <p>Lawyers for the opposing side have argued that the authorities often direct voters to the wrong precinct. </p> <p>In Texas, President Bush received two early votes yesterday from a constituency that has not required much campaigning effort on his part: his parents.</p>",
  "Here it comes again, that sinking feeling. Four years ago I travelled across the US, following the presidential campaign, and came away alarmed that Al Gore was not doing enough to win an election that should have been his. Now I have that same queasy feeling - except this time it's not only about the simple matter of who will win and who will lose on November 2. Now it's a deep concern about what is happening to the United States itself. <p>Start with the contest. Of course, after the 2000 melodrama, only an idiot would dare predict the outcome of this election. The polls are a statistical breath apart - though the latest all nudge in President Bush's direction - and the electoral college system means any number of twists are possible. Holding the states that should be reliably his, coupled with even a small uptick in Democratic turnout in the single state of Ohio, could still win the presidency for John Kerry.</p> <p>But the intangible, unscientific indicators - of mood, of atmosphere - leave me anxious. The events I saw on Monday are a good example. The morning was spent in Marlton, a small town in the rural south of New Jersey. The community centre there was packed for a Bush rally, filled with the usual cast of characters - the local pols, the dedicated volunteers, the women in stars-and-stripes sweaters. I was expecting enthusiasm from this loyal Republican audience. What I saw was fervour. </p> <p>The ear-splitting applause began before the candidate was in the room, stirred by the thunderous sound of Marine One - the presidential chopper - overhead. Once Bush entered, it was uncontained. He was received as a hero, his every sentence greeted with a rapturous ovation. </p> <p>His theme was \"A Safer America\"; his argument, that only he could protect the US. His opponent was weak, proposing a \"strategy of retreat\". He would \"take the fight to the enemy\". His opponent \"had chosen the easy path of protest and defeatism\", he stood firm and resolute: \"We will not let up in this fight.\" </p> <p>Every statement, delivered and punched home by Bush, brought a new wave of euphoria. \"You'll keep us safe!\" shouted one man. \"Amen!\" said another, before finally the room erupted in a chorus: \"U-S-A! U-S-A! U-S-A!\" </p> <p>The very sight of Bush in New Jersey was a mark of confidence: the state, which has not voted Republican since 1988, should be firmly in the Kerry column. But that self-belief was entirely in keeping with the mood of the crowd. Asked if Bush was going to win the election, none hesitated: absolutely. </p> <p>Later that day, Kerry's running mate was performing in the next-door state of Pennsylvania. That the energy would be of lower voltage here was obvious; John Edwards is not at the top of the ticket. The contrast was striking, all the same. Edwards is a smooth, effective performer, but the room was hardly electrified. People wandered in and out; the applause was strong but not fervent. Asked if they thought they would win on November 2, these Democratic loyalists ummed and erred: they hoped so but were not certain. </p> <p>You can hardly blame them. America's centre of gravity has moved rightward, creating a set of shibboleths that cannot be challenged. If liberals established a few forbidden zones in the last 20 years under the rubric of so-called political correctness - making it off-limits to demean women, gays and ethnic minorities - then the right has now erected some barriers of its own. </p> <p>First among these taboos is the military. No politician can utter a word that seems to question the armed services: so Kerry does not mention the Abu Ghraib scandal. Next is 9/11, which has been all but sanctified in American discourse. Because of that event, the US has re-imagined itself as a victim nation: witness the yellow-ribbon bumperstickers, usually bearing the slogan \"Support America\". (Ribbons were previously reserved for the suffering: red for Aids, pink for breast cancer.) </p> <p>As a result, any action taken in the name of 9/11 cannot be questioned. Oppose the Patriot Act, with its restrictions on civil liberties, and you are a friend of the terrorists - and, if you are a Democratic congressional candidate, Republicans will air TV ads against you placing your face alongside that of Osama bin Laden.</p> <p>Show concern for international opinion, and you are some kind of traitor. Kerry spoke French to a Haitian audience in Florida on Monday, the first time he had done so in public for many months: even to appear to have links with the outside world is a negative in today's politics, which has become all about America first. </p> <p>All this is partly caused by, and certainly reinforces, that gut feeling of certainty that animates today's American right. Bill Clinton used to joke that when Democrats are in the White House, they think they are renting it. Republicans believe they own the place. </p> <p>The proof came during the Clinton years, culminating in the impeachment process: Republicans fundamentally did not accept the legitimacy of a Democratic president. Something similar was on display in Florida in 2000: the Republicans were determined and disciplined, convinced power should belong to them. That's what I saw in that hall in Marlton and why I am anxious about these next 13 days: when it comes to the dogfight of winning this close contest, I suspect the Republicans will simply be more ruthless about seizing the prize. But this political sense of entitlement has an extra edge, one embodied by the president himself. For his inner certainty is about more than partisan affiliation. It is a question of faith. </p> <p>George Bush is a born-again Christian, one of the 42% of Americans who describe themselves that way. Other presidents were religious, but Bush seems to have created something new - what even some of his allies call \"the faith-based presidency\". </p> <p>A striking profile in Sunday's New York Times magazine interviewed a clutch of Republican insiders who had discovered that belief is the organising principle of the Bush White House. Advisers, even cabinet members, are simply meant to believe in the wisdom of the president, whatever countervailing evidence there may be. Bush's former environment secretary, Christine Todd Whitman, is quoted: \"In meetings, I'd ask if there were any facts to support our case. And for that, I was accused of disloyalty!\" Senators are told not to worry about the complexities of Iraq; the president's \"instincts\", his \"gut\" tells him he's doing the right thing. </p> <p>\"This instinct he's always talking about is this sort of weird, Messianic idea of what he thinks God has told him to do,\" Bruce Bartlett, a Republican and former official in Bush's father's administration, tells the magazine. At a recent campaign event, one voter told Bush he truly believed God was now in the White House: the president did not argue. </p> <p>Most revealing of all is the phrase used by a Bush aide to dismiss the inquiries of the New York Times writer. The journalist is told he lives in \"the reality-based community\". People like him worry about observable facts, while the Bush camp lives in a different universe, a realm where belief shapes reality. </p> <p>Look hard enough and you can see this mindset in the current Bush campaign. The Bush-Cheney billboards with the single slogan: One Nation Under God. The unwavering certainty of the supporters in Marlton. Bush's inability to name a single mistake of his presidency. There can be no doubt; they are doing the Lord's work. </p> <p>Bush is a subtle enough politician not to make his campaign an overt religious crusade. But he communicates, through nods and winks, to his evangelical base: they know the mission he is on. He uses their language, answering a question on abortion by referring to a \"culture of life\", one of their favoured phrases, or nodding to a 19th-century supreme court ruling often cited in their own literature. </p> <p>This is a revolutionary shift for a country that was founded on the separation of church and state. If Bush wins on November 2, the chances are strong that the shift will accelerate, perhaps even towards permanence. </p> <p>Thanks to mortality, three or four spaces are likely to open up in the next four years on the nine-person Supreme Court. The next president will get to pick whether those judges are liberals or conservatives. </p> <p>In 2000, Bush said his favourite supreme court justices were the ultraconservatives, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. If he named four more in their image, giving them a majority on the court, then the face of modern America could be changed within a few years. </p> <p>Such a bench would no longer deem abortion a constitutional right; it would allow individual states to ban it, which they would do, across swathes of the country. If past Scalia-Thomas decisions are any guide, laws on everything from clean air to access for the disabled, affirmative action for ethnic minorities to gay rights would all be struck down. (When the supreme court last year heard the case of a gay man arrested for having sex in his own home, Scalia and Thomas sided against the man and with the police.) Crucially, Thomas has argued that the Constitution's ban on established religion might not apply to the individual states. </p> <p>The campaign has hardly been fought on this ground. If anything, John Kerry has had to go along with the intrusion of religion into politics - insisting on his own Catholic credentials, telling audiences that he was once an altar boy. But the tension is there. </p> <p>It has manifested itself in the issue of research using embryonic stem-cells. Kerry says it should continue, using new lines of cells if necessary; Bush wants no more lines to be created, no more of what he calls the destruction of life. Kerry says stem cell research might have found a cure for Ronald Reagan's Alzheimers or for Christopher Reeve's paralysis. Bush says the work will have to stop. </p> <p>As the faithful streamed out of the Evesham Recreational Centre in Marlton, a Kerry-Edwards bus with a loudhailer was taunting them from across the road: \"Don't be scared of science, guys. Please guys, we need science.\" </p> <p>It seemed an odd kind of election slogan, but it might be right to the point. For the clash under way now is about more than Bush v Kerry, right v left. It seems to be an emerging clash of tradition against modernity, faith against reason. The true believers pitted against the \"reality-based community\". </p> <p>That leaves two questions, one for the future, one for November 2. For the future: how long can these two competing world views, so far apart from each other and so sharply divided, co-exist in the same country? For November 2: which of these two camps is going to be absolutely determined to win?</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:freedland@theguardian.com\">freedland@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "In a balanced, multi-party parliamentary democracy, Ralph Nader would have been a candidate for secular sainthood. He forced consumer protection - physical and financial - on to the public agenda in the 1960s, saving thousands of lives and billions of dollars. He championed freedom of information laws that declared that public records belong to the people, not to those who compile them. His focus on corporate kleptocracy led to reforms - albeit temporary - in political campaign finance. <p>Instead, Mr Nader has become a nominee for villainy. His country is balanced all right. It hangs on the threshold of becoming a one-party state ruled by a clique of radical religious reactionaries. If Republicans succeed in this election, the Democratic party cannot survive, as rightwing field marshal Grover Norquist put it last month without hyperbole. </p> <p>It may be unfair to blame Mr Nader for the Democrats' loss four years ago, even if he siphoned enough support from Al Gore to give Florida to the Republicans. After all, George Bush won by only three electoral college votes. Had Mr Gore won his home state of Tennessee, the presidency would have been his. So blame Mr Gore and the Democrats at least as much. No matter who bears the blame, the result has destroyed what Mr Nader has fought so hard for. Mr Bush has directed a counter-revolution that through tax and regulatory policy has restored the right of corporate America to profits over social responsibility. Not since Richard Nixon's paranoid rants has a president worked so hard to evade public review. The Freedom of Information Act, the people's window into public life, has been turned into a peephole. </p> <p>In state after state, polls now show that Nader voters could provide the margin of victory for the Democrats. A second Bush term would lead to \"tort reform\", shorthand for reining in the one effective means for holding corporate America to account through litigation. It would complete the destruction of the income tax system, replacing it with a national value added tax that would fall most heavily on the poor. It would silence the few remaining watchdogs, turning America into a closed theocracy at war with all who differ with the administration. In such a reactionary tide, what remains of Mr Nader's progressive citadels would simply wash away. </p> <p>Mr Nader owes it to his supporters, his principles and himself to withdraw from the race and throw his weight behind John Kerry. In Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania and elsewhere, his action could make a world of difference.</p>",
  "In the Middle East maelstrom, all parties acknowledge one fixed point: forceful US diplomatic engagement is essential if the central Israel-Palestine conflict is ever to be resolved. <p>But far from taking the lead over the past four years, the Bush administration has been mostly led by the nose. The man responsible for this extraordinary feat is Israel's prime minister, Ariel Sharon. </p> <p>Mr Sharon was running a \"war on terror\" when George Bush was still running a baseball team in Texas. So not surprisingly, perhaps, it is Mr Bush who, since 9/11, has followed Mr Sharon's example rather than the other way round. In his many visits to the Bush White House, Mr Sharon has exerted telling influence on America's post-9/11 agenda. Knowing Mr Bush was bent on war in Iraq, he helpfully highlighted Saddam Hussein's links to terrorist groups and financial aid to the families of Palestinian suicide bombers. Now he eggs on the US in its confrontations with Israel's enemies, Iran and Syria. </p> <p>It was Israel that, as far back as 1967, perfected the concept of pre-emptive war. It is Mr Sharon, not Mr Bush, who is the present master of the targeted assassination and mass detention without trial. It is Israeli military tactics that the US now apes in places like Falluja and Najaf. </p> <p>Deeming him unreliable, Mr Sharon refused to deal with the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat - and Mr Bush followed suit. His insistence on absolute security as a precondition for negotiations and his contemptuous dismissal of contrary UN and European views won support - and a broader, damaging emulation - in Washington. </p> <p>Most of all, Mr Sharon's basic contention, that the homeland is under attack by ruthless forces bent on its utter destruction, has been adopted wholesale by Mr Bush and applied to the US itself. These politics of fear now form a central plank in his re-election platform. </p> <p>Brent Scowcroft, the national security veteran, recently described Mr Bush as \"mesmerised\" by Israel's leader. And for the most part, it does indeed appear that Sharon policy is Bush policy, rather than vice versa. </p> <p>Whether the issue is Israel's illegal security fence, unilateral disengagement from Gaza, expanding West Bank settlements, the fate of the moribund road map for peace, or US vetoes at the UN, Mr Sharon calls the shots. He has the world's only superpower dancing to his tune. Unless Mr Sharon loses office - a not impossible scenario given the rebellion in his Likud party over Gaza - this well-established dynamic is unlikely to change during a second Bush term. </p> <p>Dismayingly for the Palestinians and others opposed to Mr Sharon's policies, it also seems unlikely that a John Kerry presidential victory would make any significant difference. Like Mr Bush, Mr Kerry in theory supports a viable Palestinian state. \"The conflict will not be an afterthought but a priority,\" he has said. </p> <p>But he also wants a new Palestinian leadership as a precondition for progress. He backs Mr Sharon's Gaza withdrawal plan, rejects the right of return, and says it is \"unrealistic\" to try to reinstate the 1949 armistice lines. These positions coupled with his strongly pro-Israel Senate record hardly suggest an even-handed approach - or the forceful US engagement so lacking under Mr Bush. </p> <p>\"When I am president of the United States, my promise to the people of Israel will be this,\" Mr Kerry told the Anti-Defamation League in May. \"We will never pressure you to compromise your security. We will never expect you to negotiate for peace without a credible partner. And we will always work to provide political, military and economic help for your fight against terror. </p> <p>\"Building a stronger Israel and a stronger America means working together to combat the terror that threatens us all.\" Not much wiggle-room there; and no corresponding list of promises for the Palestinians. </p> <p>Mr Bush could not have said it better. As for the guileful Mr Sharon, he must be laughing all the way to the West Bank.</p>",
  "<p><br>John Kerry and John Edwards: 'We've got better hair'. Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images</p> <p>You can probably call it payback for Fahrenheit 911. Shots of the Bush administration preening and being preened before television appearances were a low hit, and even if you would never think about licking a comb and running it through your hair, does that mean that Paul Wolfowitz should be stopped from making himself look the best he can? But the only hair in this race is vice presidential candidate John Edwards', a thick and bouncy mane that gives him a more boyish look than most men in their 50s. It has even become an election issue, of sorts. George Bush told one rally he did not pick the balding Dick Cheney as his running mate because he had \"the waviest hair in the race, I didn't pick him for his hairdo\". John Kerry told another he and Mr Edwards were going to win in November because \"we've got better hair\".</p> <p>And so, here's the revenge.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://slate.msn.com/id/2108216/slideshow/2108085/entry/2108087/speed/100\">video</a>, via <strong>Slate</strong>, of Mr Edwards fixing his hair, tending it with hands and a brush, and checking the results in the mirror of a powder compact.

He either strives to live up to his reputation every moment of the day - or is a little wary after what Michael Moore did to his colleagues.</p>",
  "Despite Alan Milburn holding his first press conference as Labour's election strategist yesterday, it's unlikely Tony Blair will be able to escape the shadow of Iraq at today's session of PMQs. <p>So far, 45 of his own backbenchers are calling for a vote before UK troops are allowed to relieve US forces, a position echoed by the Liberal Democrats and mirroring concern among some Tories. Mr Blair is unlikely to get through 30 minutes without facing accusations that the request is both already a done deal, and that it's primary purpose is helping US president George Bush's re-election campaign, rather than Iraq. </p> <p>Aside from Iraq, the prime minister is likely to be called on to explain his personal view of the Tomlinson report into education qualifications (having said A-levels would remain), and it's likely he may be drawn into the Boris Johnson/Liverpool row by one of that city's MPs ...</p> <p><b>Midday</b><br> Before answering questions, Mr Blair pays tribute to Margaret Hassan, the half-British half-Iraqi hostage taken in Baghdad yesterday.</p> <p>Glasgow's Tom Harris puts the case for vocational apprenticeships.

He adds that he does not believe it is appropriate for parliamentary votes on troop deployments in wartime - but he wants to know whether or not a decision has been taken?</p> <p>\"No a decision has not been taken - for the reasons General McColl [the senior British officer in the region] explained this morning.\" But there is a limit to what I can or should say, adds the prime minister - that would help terrorists and insurgents, but \"we are about to enter a period of increased activity in Iraq\". </p> <p>There has been a \"spike of activity in Ramadan,\" he says, resulting in the US request for extra troops. It is an operational request, he insists. \"If we do it, the Black Watch will be back by Christmas,\" he reveals.</p> <p>\"I cannot say where in Iraq they are going, but much of the speculation has been wholly wrong\". They won't be going to Falluja for instance, and nor is the chief of defence staff unhappy that a request has been made. It's a long answer from the prime minister, and listened to quietly. </p> <p>Mr Howard expresses his admiration for Black Watch, and welcomes the announcement that they will be home for Christmas. But the question everyone is asking is this, continues the Tory leader: if there are 138,000 US troops in Iraq, why do they need 600 British ones?</p> <p>Not all the US troops are \"fit for this particular purpose\", says Mr Blair, and the request is a purely operational matter. </p> <p>But Bradford's Marsha Singh butts in: \"Isn't it time to say no to the Americans, and time to stop digging?\"</p> <p>The prime minister disagrees. </p> <p><b>12.10pm</b><br> The Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy, quotes an email from the mother of a squaddie saying her son had already been told the US request had been granted. There is uproar.</p> <p>Mr Blair accuses him of not helping to reassure the families of the Black Watch. Mr Kennedy comes back at him, saying if is he is so confident of his argument for further deployment then he should \"put it to the test\" in the Commons.</p> <p>Labour's Colin Burgson then raises allegations that civil servants have been attempting to headhunt US corporations to run British young offenders' institutions.</p> <p><b>12.15pm</b><br> Michael Howard returns, asking on matrons and the MRSA superbug rather than Tomlinson. Families of victims are lobbying parliament today to say that for all the extra money spent the number of MRSA victims has doubled under Labour.</p> <p>\"Everyone in this country is crying out for cleaner hospitals,\" he concludes. Mr Blair reminds him that it was the Tories who first contracted out hospital cleaning. The NHS is now in a state of renewal, he argues - but when Labour took over it was in state of collapse.</p> <p>Mr Howard decries the link between the superbug and the contracting out of hospital cleaning. The Department of Health's own study said there was no link, he reveals. \"When is this prime minister going to stop trying to pull the wool over people's eyes?\".</p> <p>The Speaker has to quieten MPs down. </p> <p><b>12.20pm</b><br> Dumfries' Russell Brown complains at the merging of Scottish regiments.

  "They are the numbers flying by on the TV screen, and if you're living and dying by the presidential race, no amount of Zoloft can even out the highs and the lows they bring. <p>George Bush and John Kerry are tied in the brand-new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll. Kerry is up by three in a Democracy Corps poll released on Tuesday. He was down by three in the New York Times poll on Tuesday morning, down by five in the Washington Post poll on Tuesday night, tied in last night's Zogby tracking poll, and down by an alarming eight in the CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll released over the weekend.</p> <p>Like a dieter checking the scales each morning, those of us who spend our days hitting the refresh button at <a href=\"http://pollingreport.com/\">PollingReport.com</a> are going crazy over the minute-by-minute back and forth of it all. If you know what time the Washington Post puts up its tracking poll each day, you need to admit that you have a problem. </p> <p>OK, so it's 5pm EDT. </p> <p>What you need - what we need - is a system. We're here to help. Here are four methodical ways to look at the polling - four ways to clear your head, to keep track of where things are going, and to avoid shouting out wrong track, right track numbers when your kids leave their soccer shoes in the middle of the kitchen. </p> <p>The good news if you're a Kerry supporter or just a glutton for unbearable tension: any way you look at it - except maybe the way in which Gallup calculates its oddball likely-voter numbers - the presidential race is extremely close. </p> <p>Here are some ways to look at it. </p> <p>Pick your pollsters based on past performance. George Bush won the electoral college in 2000, but Al Gore won the popular vote by 48.4 to 47.9. No pre-election poll reported those numbers exactly, but some came a lot closer than others to predicting Gore's half-point margin of victory. </p> <p>The best of the bunch were Zogby, Democracy Corps and Fox/Opinion Dynamics. Zogby's final tracking poll had Gore up by one, while Democracy Corp and Fox had the race tied. In other words, each of the three was off by about half a point. </p> <p>Other polls fared less well in 2000, almost always by suggesting a better result for Bush than the one he got. Gallup had Bush over Gore by two in its final 2000 poll, meaning it was off by around 2.5 points. The final ABC/Washington Post tracking poll had Bush over Gore by two, off by around 3.5 points. And the final CBS/New York Times poll had Bush up by five, meaning it was off by 5.5 points. </p> <p>What it gets you: past performance may not guarantee future results, but let's just assume, for a moment, that the three polls that came closest to getting it right in 2000 are the closest to getting it right today. Last night's Zogby poll had the 2004 race tied at 45-45. On Tuesday morning, Democracy Corps had Kerry up by three points, 50-47. And Tuesday afternoon's Fox/Opinion Dynamics poll had Bush up 49-42 among likely voters. Average these three top-performing polls from 2000, and you get Bush ahead by a little more than a point now. Watch registered, not likely, voters. </p> <p>Most polls report two sets of numbers: one for registered voters, the other for a smaller subset of respondents whom the pollsters deem to be \"likely\" voters. The registered voter numbers are relatively consistent from poll to poll, while the likely voter numbers vary dramatically. </p> <p>Among registered voters, the CBS/New York Times poll has the race tied; ABC/Washington Post and Time have Bush up by one, and Gallup and Newsweek have him up by two. </p> <p>Differences among those five polls are well within their margins of error. But among likely voters, those same five polls have Bush leads ranging from one point (CBS/New York Times) to eight points (Gallup). Add in Democracy Corps' three-point lead for Kerry, and you get an 11-point spread in likely voter numbers. </p> <p>Ruy Teixeira, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation and the Centre for American Progress, advises those who follow his blog \"Focus on the RV data, ignore the LV data.\" Each poll has its own methodology for identifying likely voters, and the calculations are seldom transparent. The screens and weighting that polls use can end up oversampling either Democrats or Republicans. </p> <p>The latest Gallup poll projects that more Republicans than Democrats will vote in 2004, the opposite of what happened in 2000. And poll screening frequently excludes new registrants because, while they may be highly motivated to vote in this election, they didn't vote in the last one. </p> <p>In the latest Democracy Corps poll, new registrants favour Kerry by a 24-point margin. Finally, in a recent article in Public Opinion Quarterly, New York University political science professor Robert Erikson and two colleagues argue that week to week shifts in Gallup's likely voter results stem not from shifts in voters' views but from changes in the composition of Gallup's likely voter pool. </p> <p>Where it gets you: if you average the registered voter numbers from the latest big polls - CBS/New York Times, ABC/Washington Post, Time, Newsweek and Gallup - you get Bush up by around 1.2 points. Forget the comparative polls - watch Bush's numbers. </p> <p>There's one thing on which Democratic and Republican strategists agree, at least sometimes: the most important number to watch in a re-election race is the one belonging to the incumbent. The president's number in pre-election polling - whether it's his percentage of support from respondents or his job-approval rating - is a good predictor of the percentage of votes the president will receive on election day. </p> <p>That's the point that Bush-Cheney pollster Matthew Dowd made back in March, when he said that \"normally, presidents finish roughly the same as their job approval numbers\". And it's the point that Democratic pollster Stanley Greenberg made on a call with reporters Tuesday. \"Everybody I know who runs a campaign focuses on that number, as where he's likely to end up.\" </p> <p>The theory is this: After four years with George Bush, people know him and know what they think about him. Barring some catastrophic external event, people who are lined up against Bush now aren't likely to move in his direction on election day, and undecided voters are likely to break heavily in favour of Kerry. </p> <p>So Kerry can pick up votes on election day - so many that he can win, even if polls accurately show him trailing by a few points the night before the election - but Bush is stuck with whatever number he's got. Or so the theory goes. </p> <p>So let's go to the numbers, starting with Bush's job approval rating. The ABC/Washington Post poll has it at 54; Gallup has it at 51; Time has it at 49; Newsweek and Democracy Corps have it at 47; the CBS/New York Times poll has it at 44. Average them all, and you get 48.7. </p> <p>Now let's look at Bush's share of the vote in the polls. He gets 51 from the ABC/Washington Post poll, 45 from Zogby, 47 from the CBS/New York Times poll, 52 from Gallup, 47 from Democracy Corps, 50 from Newsweek and 48 from Time. That's an average of 48.6%. Use Gallup's 49% registered voter number rather than its 52% likely voter number, and the average drops to 48. </p> <p>Where it gets you: is 48.7% or 48.6% or 48% enough for Bush to win the popular vote? Maybe. It was just enough for Al Gore to win the popular vote in 2000 - and lose the electoral college. If Bush's number is the right number to watch, it appears the 2004 race is exactly as close as the 2000 race was. Forget the national polls - focus on the electoral college. </p> <p>When it's all said and done, the electoral college vote is the only one that matters. You can keep tabs on the electoral college vote in a few different places. Each has a different methodology, and each comes up with different results. </p> <p>The Electoral Vote Predictor 2004 uses the latest poll from each state, regardless of the poll's credibility, and awards a state to whoever is leading in the latest poll, no matter by how much. Thus, in Tuesday's tally, Kerry gets Florida's 27 electoral college votes based on a slim one-point lead in a Survey USA poll that might be more accurately called a tie. It's an un-nuanced, winner takes all approach where a huge number of electoral college votes can swing with truly minuscule changes in the popular vote - exactly like the electoral college itself. </p> <p>USA Today's battleground state tracker also uses the latest polls, but it seems to refrain from painting a state red or blue until there's a consensus in the polls beyond their margins of error. Thus, while Kerry is up by four in the latest Wisconsin poll, USA Today lists it as a toss-up state. </p> <p>The Washington Post's electoral college map is a somewhat slower-moving and more subjective affair, combining recent polling with analysis from the likes of David Broder. It's more cautious than the others, too: while it acknowledges that most observers have handed Oregon to Kerry, the Post is holding off because, it says, both sides still think the state is in play. </p> <p>The CBS News electoral vote map is also on the cautious side. But unlike the Post, CBS offers no state-specific information about the polling or analysis that leads to its calls. </p> <p>Where it gets you: It takes 270 electoral college votes to win. As of Tuesday evening, the Electoral Vote Predictor 2004 has Kerry up 284-247; USA Today has Bush up 216-213, the Washington Post has Bush up 208-179, and CBS has Bush up 222-217. Average the four, and you get a race that's exactly tied: 223.25 for Bush, 223.25 for Kerry. </p> <p>There are other ways to look at this thing - futures trading, first-wife cookie contests, a geography-based test that compares the candidates' names and the names of cities and towns in America. But if you're grasping for those kinds of straws, maybe it would be better to take a break from the whole thing now. </p> <p>In just two weeks, Tim Russert will be on TV with his handheld white board, moving states from red to blue and back again. All will be known then. Or maybe not.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> This article has been provided by Salon through a special arrangement with Guardian Newspapers Limited.<br> Visit the Salon site at <a href=\"http://www.salon.com\">Salon.com</a> <br>\u00a9 Salon.com 2004</p>",
  "<p>It's not often you find Leonardo da Vinci and Grayson Perry exhibited in the same room - after all, how could the renaissance master hope to compete with the Turner prize winner's crazed, cartoon earthenware? The Biggest Draw is, however, as much a hands-on event as a coherent exhibition, intended to inspire a mass sharpening of pencils up and down the country. </p> <p>The \"anything goes\" ethos makes this huge display feel generously inclusive, if somewhat lacking in focus. On the plus side, there are representative examples of the greatest draughtsmen in the western tradition, from Holbein and Durer to Hockney and Rego. Yet they're dotted about between William Morris prints, Mary Quant designs and Henry Beck's original schematic doodle of the London Underground map. These strange bedfellows are bundled under a variety of section headings intended to define what a drawing is, or what it might be for. Salvador Dali says, \"drawing is the honesty of art . . . it is either good or bad\" - or in his own case, pretty terrible, as a flaccid piece of pallid, surrealism-by-numbers makes clear. Paul Klee playfully talks about \"taking a line for a walk\"; while environmental artist Richard Long actually goes for a walk and draws a line to indicate where he's been. </p> <p>For Frank Auerbach, sketching was a form of artistic laxative - he claimed he \"couldn't really start a painting in the morning until [he'd] done a drawing\"; while according to Bruegel's biographer it was a regurgitation - the artist \"swallowed all the mountains and rocks and spat them out again on to his canvases and panels\". </p> <p>Yet neither can match the faecal immediacy of Kerry Trengrove's wildlife studies, sketched in the field out of deer poo.

  "If a week is a long time in politics then seven months is an eternity. At least this is how it must seem to Angela Merkel, the leader of Germany's opposition conservatives, who until recently appeared a sure bet to become Germany's next chancellor. <p>Back in March Merkel's Christian Democratic (CDU) party had a commanding lead in the opinion polls, registering 50% support. Germany's chancellor, Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, and his SPD party, which governs in a centre-left coalition with the Greens, seemed in deep trouble. </p> <p>Schr\u00f6der's attempts to reform Germany's welfare state had met with enormous opposition - not just from ordinary Germans but from leftwingers within his own party. The SPD had experienced a series of crushing election defeats. Since then, however, everything that could have gone wrong for Merkel - who took over as the Christian Democrats' leader in 2000 - has gone wrong. </p> <p>Last week Merkel's heavyweight finance spokesman and potential rival, the cerebral Friedrich Merz, announced that he was stepping down from the opposition front bench. This week Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, a former interior minister and the CDU's main foreign policy expert, turned down Merkel's offer of Merz's old job. </p> <p>Germany's bestselling tabloid Bild was blunt. Yesterday it described the move as \"Sch\u00e4uble's cold revenge on Merkel\". The politician had snubbed Merkel because of her failure earlier this year to support his bid to become Germany's president, it speculated.</p> <p>The opinion polls, meanwhile, have shown a decline in CDU support - from 50% in March to 40% in October. Schr\u00f6der's ratings have, unexpectedly, recovered, with his SPD now on 30%. </p> <p>Suddenly, what appeared unthinkable earlier this year now seems tantalisingly possible - Schr\u00f6der, and Joschka Fischer, Germany's Green foreign minister, could win an unprecedented third time when Germany next goes to the polls in 2006. </p> <p>The reasons for Merkel's recent difficulties appear to be various, but most pundits agree that in the end it all comes down to power. </p> <p>A Protestant who grew up in communist East Germany, Merkel does not share the same background as most of her male CDU colleagues, who tend to come from the mainly Catholic states in former West Germany. </p> <p>Some party officials have admitted that there is now a whispering campaign against her led by what Der Spiegel has dubbed the federal princes - regional leaders such as Roland Koch, Christian Wulff, and Peter M\u00fcller - all of whom appear to want Merkel's job. </p> <p>But Merkel's most deadly rival is Edmund Stoiber, the leader of the CDU's Bavarian sister party the CSU. Stoiber was the conservative opposition candidate during Germany's last general election in 2002. He lost, but appears determined to become the \"Kanzlerkandidat\" again.</p> <p>Earlier this year he witheringly dismissed Merkel and her liberal coalition partner Guido Westerwelle as \"Leichtmatrozen\" or lightweights - literally light sailors - and compared them unflatteringly with the heavyweight duo of Schr\u00f6der and Fischer. </p> <p>Both the CDU and CSU, meanwhile, have been at odds for more than a year over the issue of how to reform Germany's health insurance system. But the row is less about health than about the increasingly glacial rivalry between Merkel and Stoiber, and the unresolved question of who gets to challenge Schr\u00f6der next time round.</p> <p> In an interview over the weekend Merkel struck a phlegmatic note. \"After 15 years in politics I'm over the phase where things really surprise me,\" she told Der Spiegel. </p> <p>It is too early to write off Merkel, who has been inaccurately, and unhelpfully, compared by both the German and the British press to Margaret Thatcher. But if she is to survive the latest round of sniping from her own knife-wielding colleagues she could do worse than to adopt one of Thatcher's less loveable traits - her ruthlessness.</p>",

More rewards are undoubtedly forthcoming in terms of their votes. </p> <p>Of course, for the average Joe, the picture is not quite so rosy. Bush's spending sprees and tax cuts for the rich have led to the worst budget crisis the US has faced in half a century. Which means not enough money for teachers: in Oklahoma and Oregon and Idaho we see them having to mop floors, drive school buses, and rely upon the proceeds of cake sales to be kept on staff. Not enough money for healthcare - 45 million Americans no longer have health insurance.

  "Tony Blair was facing mounting pressure over whether to send UK troops to back up American forces in Iraq, with more than 40 of his own backbenchers backing the Liberal Democrats in calling for a Commons vote on the issue. <p>With increasing opposition to any deployment, even among the Conservatives, the prime minister will be quizzed at lunchtime in the weekly session of prime minister's questions.</p> <p>Downing Street will also be keeping a close eye on the appearance by Sir Jock Stirrup, chief of the air staff, when he is cross-examined by MPs at a meeting of the defence select committee this afternoon.</p> <p>A decision on whether to commit UK troops will be made this week by army chiefs, following a reconnaissance mission yesterday.</p> <p>But backbench MPs, including many who supported the war, worry that easing the way for US troops to launch an all-out attack on Falluja ahead of the US election has political implications - even if the British government insists the decision is purely \"operational\".</p> <p>So far 45 Labour MPs have signed an early day motion, tabled by anti-war MP Alice Mahon, calling for a Commons vote on troop deployments. Such a move would be unusual for an armed forces decision - but then the Commons vote to commit military action in March 2003 was also unprecedented.</p> <p>More significantly, loyalists have urged the prime minister not to accede to the US request. Backbencher Andrew Mackinlay, who voted for the war, said he and most of his colleagues did not believe the US was incapable of filling the troops gap with its own forces.</p> <p>\"We have to say thus far and no further,\" he argued. \"We have given 110% and I think they are just asking too much of us.\"</p> <p>The MPs will be further angered by reports that, despite Mr Blair's denials, the decision was taken more than a week ago. </p> <p>The Conservative leader, Michael Howard, who says there must be \"compelling justification\" for the change, will seek to capitalise on Labour divisions.</p> <p>Mr Blair last night again insisted that any decision would be made for military and not \"political\" reasons.</p> <p>However, suspicion over US president George Bush's appeal for help is shared even by some normally loyal backbenchers who backed the war.</p> <p>With the presidential election a fortnight away they fear Mr Bush simply wants to rebut opponent John Kerry's claim that US isolation has left American troops carrying the can.</p> <p>Experts have warned that casualties will reached previously unseen levels if a UK battalion is sent to the lawless area south of Baghdad.</p> <p>The Americans want the British to \"back-fill\" for them, freeing up US troops to join the intensifying assault on the insurgent stronghold of Falluja.</p> <p>The government has not confirmed officially where the Americans want British troops to deploy. </p> <p>Reports have suggested that US commanders have asked the British to fill in for them in Iskandariya, 25 miles south of Baghdad, releasing the 24th Marine Expeditionary Force for other operations.</p> <p>The most likely candidate for the role is thought to be the Black Watch, which is currently the reserve battalion in the British-controlled southern sector.</p> <p>Mr Blair insisted last night that the request for assistance had come from the US military, not the White House.</p> <p>\"This has been a request by the American military to the British military, not a request politically from the US president to me,\" he said.</p> <p>\"No decision will be taken to redeploy British troops unless it is clear militarily that that should and can happen.</p> <p>\"The only elections that matter in this regard are the Iraqi elections next January.\"</p> <p>However, the foreign secretary, Jack Straw, earlier said the government was \"very sympathetic\" to the American request.</p> <p>Confirming the request on Monday, the defence secretary, Geoff Hoon, said a decision would be taken by the chief of the defence staff, General Sir Michael Walker, by the middle of the week.</p>",
  "<p>American politics could have turned out very differently if a little-known presidential campaign of the mid-1960s had been able to vault the millionaires-only hurdle. Duke Ellington could have been secretary of state, Max Roach could have been running the military, and the CIA might have been under the thumb of that master of subterfuge, Miles Davis himself. </p> <p>The presidential candidate offering these irresistible alternatives was the trumpeter and bebop pioneer John Birks \"Dizzy\" Gillespie, who declared himself a runner in 1964, up against Lyndon Johnson and Barry Goldwater. As well as a potential cabinet of jazz all-stars, Gillespie's ticket advocated US withdrawal from Vietnam, putting African-American astronauts into space, and renaming the White House the Blues House. </p> <p>The short-lived Gillespie presidential run is being celebrated from now until voting day 2004 at the Soho Theatre in London, in American actor Jake Broder's Vote Dizzy! Broder is better known for his devotion to the late satirist, surrealist and all-round subversive Richard \"Lord\" Buckley, whose influence has been audible in artists from Lenny Bruce and Richard Pryor to Robin Williams and Captain Beefheart. Though Broder's Lord Buckley show provides much of the fuel for Vote Dizzy!, the impetus of the 2004 election has turned it into a hybrid of Buckley material and Gillespie campaign-trail anecdote, with live jazz, spoof political conventions and John Hendricks's original Vote Dizzy! election song (performed by vocalist David Tughan) thrown in. </p> <p>Gillespie got his nickname from his habit of taking a joke a long way, but he never meant the presidential gag to get as far as it did. In 1963 he had marketed \"Dizzy for President\" badges to raise money for Core (Congress for Racial Equality), and a variety of civil rights projects under Dr Martin Luther King's direction. But his fans were so keen on the idea, he decided to run with it. Shortage of cash forced Gillespie out of the race long before polling day, but not before fans had had a chance to preach their favourite gospel - that if the world's leaders understood the open, collectively motivated, border-crossing language of jazz, nobody would be rich, but nobody would mind and the world might be safer and saner. </p> <p>\"When you dig under the surface of most comedy,\" Broder says, \"you often find anger and fury. But not with Lord Buckley and not with Dizzy. Dig into there and you just find love. They were tilting at windmills, but aren't we all?\"</p>",
  "The drive from Detroit to Mason City, Iowa, begins with car plants and ends with cornfields. Turning your back on the Motor City, you pass through the rustbelt, trace the lower contours of Lake Michigan and, after you've passed Chicago, cruise under the big skies and through open prairie. <p>The few hours spent in Illinois offer a brief respite from the political advertisements that dominate the airwaves in the swing states. Once in Iowa they are back, with the soft rock and hardcore evangelism that form the staples across the country. </p> <p>At the McDonald's in Mason City, Travis is struggling with the till while a customer waits for the change from his Chicken McGrill and double cheeseburger. </p> <p>Tom Unzicker, a supporter of the independent candidate, Ralph Nader, tries to make Travis's day just that little brighter. </p> <p>\"How would you like to supersize your wages?\" he asks, offering Travis a leaflet promising to raise the minimum wage from $5.15 to $10 (\u00a35.56) an hour if Mr Nader is elected. Travis looks confused and goes back to the register. </p> <p>After leafleting the mostly elderly customers and a few of Travis's colleagues, but getting little in the way of positive response, Mr Unzicker gives up and orders a strawberry milkshake. Leaving, he finds one of his leaflets torn up on the counter. </p> <p>It's been a tough, frustrating and rather unproductive day for Mr Unzicker, who is working full-time trying to mobilise support for Mr Nader, the anti-war and anti-corporate crusader, in Iowa and Minnesota. Driving one of the campaign's 20 vans, he is coordinating the efforts in two swing states which the Democrat Al Gore won narrowly in 2000. This time John Kerry and George Bush are on 47% each; Mr Nader has 1%. </p> <p>His efforts seem a sorry blend of hapless and hopeless. When he arrived in nearby Clear Lake his only contact there was out. In Mason City the man he was meant to meet was busy. The interview he had planned with the press was cancelled; the one he tried to arrange with another paper could not take place because it had not been planned far enough in advance. </p> <p>\"It's tough,\" he says. \"Much tougher than in 2000. Back then the rallies were big and the support was energetic and enthusiastic. This time people are afraid. They think anything's better than Bush and that things are so bad they have to vote for Kerry. I think if we only have Bush and Kerry to choose from, things are even worse than they think.\" </p> <p>Many Democrats still loathe Mr Nader, accusing him of handing the election to Mr Bush in 2000 by taking potential votes from Mr Gore. Their contempt has intensified since he decided to run again and took money from prominent Republicans to do so. In the past year they have tried every possible legal means to keep him off the ballot in each state, advising Democrats not to sign his petitions and challenging the signatures he does get. </p> <p>Michael Frisby, the communications director of the Stop Nader campaign, says: \"The point is not just to keep him from getting on the ballot, but to make him spend money and time in all of these places so he has less money and time to spend getting votes.\" </p> <p>Last week Mr Nader was removed from the ballot in the important swing state of Pennsylvania, many of the signatures he had submitted judged to be either duplicated or fraudulent. Last night, that decision was upheld by the supreme court. But he remains in contention in 30 states, including six swing states where polls indicate he has greater support than the thin margin between Mr Bush and Mr Kerry. </p> <p>On Monday he announced a planned 10-state campaign swing before election day, with Iowa and Minnesota on the list. </p> <p>His campaigners point out that Mr Bush took far more votes from Democrats in 2000 than Mr Nader did. They relate tales of intense hostility from Democrats with a mixture of pride and bewilderment. </p> <p>\"I have friends who have said, 'Don't talk to me until after the election,'\" Mr Unzicker says. \"One family member asked me not to park the van in front of his house.\" But his efforts suggest the Nader campaign has more or less collapsed - a leader without an army is caught in an increasingly vicious electoral war. </p> <p>Calls to state representatives in vital states suggest a moribund list of supporters but no signs of active life. Unlike 2000, when Mr Nader had the Green party to campaign for him at the grassroots, he is on his own, backed by just a small band of loyalists including Mr Unzicker. </p> <p>\"It's not really a movement,\" says Leighton Christiansen, the Nader coordinator in Iowa City, a small, bustling student town. \"It's hard to sustain momentum.\" </p> <p>Mr Christiansen had no definite plans for more campaigning before the election. In 2000 Mr Nader did well among students, but last week no one could be found to support him at a student debate. </p> <p>Last month Mr Nader went to the Iowa City campus and attracted a crowd of 450. \"It was a great event,\" says Mr Christiansen, a truck driver. \"But it didn't really translate into anything.\" </p> <p>He hands me a list of possible Nader voters, people who expressed an interest in joining the campaign after the meeting. Beth Straeder, 20, the only one to return my calls, cast her vote early for Mr Kerry. </p> <p>\"I liked what he had to say about healthcare, the war and the minimum wage. Nader is my ideal candidate. But Kerry would not appoint justices to the supreme court who would impact on abortion rights, and I decided that was more important to me.\" </p> <p>And unlike in 2000, Mr Bush is now a known quantity. </p> <p>\"A lot of sophisticated leftwing voters made the assumption that Bush would govern as a moderate-to-rightwing conservative,\" says John Nichols, a columnist for the leftwing magazine the Nation. \"They underestimated his extremism; they underestimated how much influence people like Dick Cheney and Paul Wolfowitz would have. They didn't understand him then, and wanted to send an important message to the Democrats. </p> <p>\"But they understand him now.\" </p> <p>Many of Mr Nader's most prominent supporters, including the film-maker Michael Moore, the academic Noam Chomsky and the campaigning journalist Barbara Ehrenreich, have called on him to stand down. His running mate from 2000, Winona LaDuke, is backing Mr Kerry. At the university in Ames, Iowa, on Sunday, the film-maker called on students to turn their back on Mr Nader and support Mr Kerry. He drew a crowd of 7,500. </p> <p>But despite the lack of endorsements and support Mr Nader continues to scrape one or two per cent in the polls. </p> <p>The presumption these votes would necessarily go to Mr Kerry is precisely that - a presumption. \"I probably wouldn't vote,\" Mr Christiansen says, when asked whom he would support if Mr Nader were not on the ballot. \"Both parties represent the same interests, and if we are going to have progressive change we will need to break people from the Democratic party.\" </p> <p>The uncertainty of where the Nader votes would go is reflected in the polls. A USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll suggests that if Mr Nader were not an option, 52% would vote for Mr Bush and 44% for Mr Kerry. But a Zogby poll suggests that 41% of Mr Nader's votes would go to Mr Kerry and just 15% to Mr Bush. </p> <p>Mr Nichols believes Mr Nader's role as a spoiler in this election has been exaggerated. \"There is not a single person in America who is going to vote for Nader who desperately wants to get rid of Bush. </p> <p>\"No one at this stage is going to vote for Nader instead of John Kerry. In every election a third-party candidate will get at least one or two per cent of the vote, and this year Nader's that candidate.\" </p> <p>But Charles Cook, a political analyst in Washington, told the Los Angeles Times: \"Nader could get a half, or a third, or a fifth of the vote he got last time - and be decisive again.\" </p> <p>Mr Christiansen says if he wakes up on November 3 to find Mr Bush the victor, he won't regret a thing. And if Democrats blame him for a Bush victory, what will he tell them? </p> <p>\"Bring it on,\" he says. \"Bring. It. On.\"</p>",

  "Mr and Mrs Flynt are having a domestic. It's not a full-blown ding-dong, but a mid-level verbal skirmish, the sort of thing that lies behind many a loving relationship. \"Larry,\" she calls down the hall of their sumptuous apartment on the 10th floor of the imposing Flynt building in Beverly Hills, \"why didn't you tell me you wanted me here for the photo? I could have got ready.\" <p>In the dining room Flynt is parked in his gold-plated wheelchair, staring out of the window, possibly at the view of the city stretched out before him. He is a curious sight, his hair and skin almost matching his peach-coloured polo-neck shirt. On his wrist he wears a delicately inlaid watch, his elaborate rings sit on surprisingly long puffy fingers, their length accentuated by manicured nails. </p> <p>\"What did she say?\" he croaks in his near- inaudible high-pitched wheeze, heavily laced with the wide-open twang of his native Kentucky. </p> <p>Hal, Flynt's bodyguard and wheelchair-wheeler, approaches. \"Nothing,\" he says. \"Don't worry about it. It's a man and wife thing.\" </p> <p>\"Why wasn't she ready? Did she say she didn't know?\" </p> <p>\"I told you, don't worry about it. I'm not getting involved,\" says Hal. </p> <p>Suitably attired, Mrs Flynt, Larry's one-time nurse Liz Berrios (often now described as the power behind the throne), appears for her photograph. The couple lean awkwardly together, mimicking the pose on the oil painting hanging behind them. Liz smiles professionally and holds Larry, who wheezes and splutters, enduring his hardship with a stoicism that looks exhausting. </p> <p>\"Come on Larry,\" she says, digging her fingers into his neck. \"Smile.\" </p> <p>It's just as well that nobody is actually chucking pots and pans around. The smallest flying object could cause incalculable damage here. At every turn, behind every marble column, standing atop every antique inlaid mahogany table, a Tiffany lamp awaits, a trap laid for the clumsy and the careless. Looking down from the walls are countless Impressionist reproductions, all a little too bright and a little too clean to be the real thing, as if someone had said: \"Do me a picture like that, but ... make it more in focus.\" </p> <p>The effect, familiar from Milos Forman's 1996 film The People Vs Larry Flynt, is of a kitsch palace, a hotel lobby striving to be a museum or some lavish pimp's parlour. Flynt, of course, would not choose to describe himself as a pimp. He is, he insists, a \"smut peddler\". He has also been called a \"bottom-feeder\", an epithet which amuses him greatly. But his preferred formulation is: \"Pornography is my business, politics is my hobby.\" </p> <p>Flynt's latest foray into politics comes with the publication of his third book, Sex, Lies and Politics - the Naked Truth. It is a rabble- rousing romp through the ills and hypocrisies of contemporary American politics, an attack on the cronyism and incompetence of George Bush and the forces that put him where he is today. But it is also a lament for the betrayed ideals of the American body politic. </p> <p>\"I think other than the civil war and the first and second world wars, the six years that this book covers is probably the most significant part in the history of our country,\" he says. In the book, we are treated to some of the key anti-Bush themes from the past few years: Newt Gingrich and the hypocrisy of the Republicans; the Democrats' weakness for money; the inadequacies of America's \"poodle press\"; Enron; Chevron; Halliburton. It is a familiar but still enlightening litany. Flynt argues that he is there to join the dots. </p> <p>\"I never, from the very beginning, ever compromised my core beliefs,\" Flynt says. \"I've been in prison four times, shot and paralysed\" - by a man who took exception to a photo spread about interracial sex - \"and I figured at this point, what are they going to do to me? So I decided to devote what is left of my life to expanding the parameters of free speech.\" </p> <p>His struggle for free speech was documented in the Forman film, an account of Flynt's various legal battles, most famously his five-year tussle with evangelist Jerry Falwell, about an ad that suggested he had had sex with his mother. Falwell sued him for defamation, Flynt countersued for copyright infringement. It ended in a victory for Flynt in the supreme court, seen by many as one of the most important decisions in favour of free speech and the first amendment of the US constitution. </p> <p>Flynt makes an awkward champion of liberal causes, his professional activities - he makes Richard Desmond seem like William Rees-Mogg - raising the hackles of many who support the broad intention of his political campaigns. \"If people don't like what I do they need to get a life,\" he says, slurping on his third glass of green Gatorade, grunting as he crunches the ice. \"I'm liberal on social issues, all social issues, but I'm a fiscal conservative. That may sound paradoxical in a sense but if I don't have the money in my account, I don't write a cheque. I think the government should be the same way. We should be fiscally responsible.\" </p> <p>Flynt's personal fiscal responsibility has seen him grow to be an extremely wealthy man, adept at shifting his business to keep ahead of the changing times. The smut- peddler has moved from club owner to magazine publisher to modern media entrepreneur, with internet, film production and retail divisions all outstripping the thing that made his name, Hustler magazine. He also runs an eponymous casino in Los Angeles, where Flynt himself can often be found betting his life away at poker. One estimate suggests he loses $300,000 (\u00a3170,000) per month at the game. </p> <p>Flynt, who was born in Kentucky in 1942 in what was then the poorest county in the US, says he is not tempted to go into politics as a profession. \"Politics is the art of compromise and I've never seen anything worthwhile accomplished by a compromising person,\" he says with a rare smile. But he has stood for office, once for president, and last year for governor of California in the election won by Arnold Schwarzenegger. </p> <p>'I can see the flaws in our system and I don't have the temperament to be part of a political party,\" he says. \"And who would vote for a pornographer who's an atheist anyway? The different times I've run for political office I've always just done it to use the platform so I can get my message out.\" </p> <p>His message in the current election is clear: Bush and his cronies are corrupt liars who have misled the American people. \"There are diehard Bush loyalists who believe everything he tells them, and it's scary,\" he says. \"It's really frightening because this guy's the most unqualified person to ever sit in the Oval office. He can barely speak the native language. Now he talks to God all the time. I'm just afraid they might get their messages screwed up, and with his thumb on the [nuclear] button that doesn't make me too content.\" </p> <p>Flynt's next book is about \"something I know quite a lot about\", the sexual revolution. But before that he has to oversee his expanding retail empire. A handful of stores in the US, including a swanky emporium on Hollywood's Sunset Boulevard, complete with espresso bar, have proved a profitable addition. Flynt is also opening two stores in the UK, although he is fairly hazy on their precise whereabouts. </p> <p>\"I just make the store really nice and really plush so both men and women will feel really comfortable shopping there,\" he wheezes. \"The first we'll open in the second largest city in the United Kingdom, about two hours north of London.\" Birmingham? \"Yes, Birmingham. And the second one is in London, right next to Piccadilly Square.\" </p> <p>Britain too offers possibilities for him to pursue his hobby of politics. \"I really liked Tony Blair when he became prime minister,\" says Flynt. \"But the way he's behaved during this Iraq war, I just lost all respect for him. I don't know if he thought he would benefit from it, in terms of solidifying his power base. He's no Winston Churchill.\" </p> <p>Political hypocrites have been warned. </p> <p> <b>Nachos and throbbing paninis</b></p> <p>\"We pushed it a bit with the paninis,\" says Stefan Breg, smiling over his working menu for the Blussh Cafe. \"Nine man-inches of hot panini.\" The cafe opens next week within the erotic goods store that Hustler Hollywood is bringing to Birmingham, offering the sort of sex-and-food combo that hasn't been seen since 9Weeks. Or perhaps not. It's all in the very best taste, they tell me. A bit of fun. Even so, the appearance of cheesy nachos on a menu that includes throbbing paninis is slightly disconcerting. </p> <p>Hustler is synonymous with Larry Flynt, but Hustler Hollywood is a sanitised chain of stores run by his daughter Teresa. She has just expanded the US group from four to seven; Birmingham is the first outside the US. \"It's not right,\" says Mandy Hillen, who has sold the Evening Mail from a booth outside the store for four years. \"Families go past here. I don't approve.\" </p> <p>\"I don't mind,\" says another stallholder, watching over her stock of ponchos and scarves flapping in the rain-sodden wind, \"as long as they don't sell scarves.\" </p> <p>She shouldn't worry. If Hustler Hollywood does sell scarves, one imagines they will be strips of marabou, or shredded latex. Its stock is a predictable ensemble of sexy undies and edible this and that. The seduction range is a riot of red-fringed fishnet. Retail director Marianne Tosh says it will not sell hardcore DVDs or magazines. (Before my visit, I had to sign a form agreeing not to use the term \"Porn\", \"as that is factually incorrect\".) </p> <p>Teresa Flynt likes to call her store a \"date destination\". Given that Birmingham has the UK's highest concentration of lap-dancing bars and is the testing ground for the first in a chain of swingers' hotels called Liberation, it seems she's chosen her city wisely. And at a time when even Tesco is to start selling Vielle \"stimulators\", one suspects that Hustler's predictions of six UK stores with a \u00a328-\u00a335m gross turnover within three years might well be realistic. <b> CR</b> </p> <p> <b>\u00b7</b> Sex, Lies and Politics is published by Aurum Press, price \u00a38.99.</p>",
  "<p>Sinclair Broadcast Group, a conservative-owned chain of television stations which has provoked an uproar by its plans to broadcast incendiary allegations against John Kerry, has sacked its chief political correspondent for speaking out against the decision. </p> <p>The Washington bureau chief, Jon Lieberman, said he had been dismissed for \"telling the truth\". But Sinclair, which is owned by Republican backers, said he had been sacked for speaking to the press about \"company business\". </p> <p>Its programme, to be broadcast by 60 local stations beginning on Friday, potentially reaching a quarter of the electorate, draws principally from a film called Stolen Honour: Wounds that Never Heal. </p> <p>Made by Carlton Sherwood, a rightwing journalist, it is to comprise former Vietnam PoWs accusing Mr Kerry of betraying them by speaking against US atrocities after returning from the war. It resembles the ads of another anti-Kerry group, Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, which have hurt Mr Kerry's standing since they were first broadcast in August. </p> <p>Sinclair calls the broadcast a news programme. Democrats have tried, so far unsuccessfully, to block it on the grounds that it is not news but an illegal campaign contribution. </p> <p>\"It's biased political propaganda, with clear intentions to sway this election,\" Lieberman told the Baltimore Sun in the interview for which he was sacked. \"For me, it's not about right or left - it's about what's right or wrong in news coverage this close to an election.\" </p> <p>He could not be contacted yesterday, and Mark Hyman, Sinclair vice-president for corporate relations, did not respond to calls. </p> <p>But Mr Hyman told the Baltimore Sun: \"Everyone is entitled to their personal opinion, including Jon Lieberman ... We're disappointed that Jon's political views caused him to violate policy and speak to the press about company business.\" </p> <p>A statement on the group website said: \"The programme has not been videotaped and the exact format of this unscripted event has not been finalised.\" </p> <p>Lieberman said he and his colleagues were told to make a news programme out of clips from Stolen Honour, adding: \"The selection of the material - dumping it on the news department, and giving them four days, and running it this close to the election - it's indefensible, in my opinion.\" </p> <p>Some Sinclair shareholders said yesterday they feared the programme could hurt their investment and the advocacy group Media Matters said it was underwriting the costof a shareholder action demanding equal time for opposing views. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The St Paul Pioneer Press has suspended two reporters for three days for attending a fundraising concert in aid of voting out Mr Bush, saying they violated its ethics policy.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Nike's Highland Fling</strong><br> 7.30pm, BBC2<br> Harris tweed is one of those must-have purchases for Americans who come to Scotland to find their roots. Yet the weavers in the Outer Hebrides are danger of losing their already dwindling industry. Now the Americans are stepping in again - this time in the form of Nike, which plans to incorporate Harris tweed into a new range of trainers. </p> <p><strong> The Power of Nightmares</strong><br> 9pm, BBC2 <br> This intelligent, scintillating series is a must for anyone who has the remotest interest in what is going on the world and why. Adam Curtis traces the current terror-dominated political situation back to the United States in the late 1940s, when a political philosopher and an Egyptian schools inspector were developing their own theories about the dangers caused by a liberal society. From these origins came the beliefs of the neo-conservatives and their disastrous foreign policies, as well as the impetus for Islamist groups. What's also unsettling is watching Donald Rumsfeld peddling the same lies about the Russians in the 1970s as he did about Saddam's WMD. </p> <p><strong> The Great British Spelling Test</strong><br> 9pm, ITV1 <br> Later in the autumn the BBC will put young spellers on the spot, but ITV is jumping the gun with this adult, interactive version.

  "Michael Howard turned to Australia for help yesterday by hiring the man who played a big part in taking the country's answer to the Tory party to four straight election victories. <p>Lynton Crosby, described by the Australian prime minister as \"the most outstanding political professional\" he has worked with, will be the Tories' general election campaign director. </p> <p>The Tories have longed looked with envy at the success of John Howard, the newly re-elected Australian prime minister, who came back from the political wilderness to achieve four successive victories. </p> <p>Mr Crosby was at the heart of all the campaigns. He was deputy campaign director of the Liberal party in Mr Howard's first successful campaign in 1996. </p> <p>He served as national campaign director for his second and third victories. His company ran the party's polling and research for Mr Howard's fourth victory, which was achieved this month. </p> <p>Michael Howard said last night: \"I have known Lynton for almost 10 years and am delighted that we will have the benefit of his professional expertise in the run-up to the general election.\" </p> <p>Mr Crosby said: \"Throughout my friendship with Michael I have seen first-hand someone who is direct, means what he says, and has the determination to get the job done - not just to talk.\" </p> <p>Mr Crosby will have to adapt his thinking for the British election. John Howard, who is hailed by President George Bush as one of the staunchest supporters in the \"war against terror\", fought a strong campaign against the anti-war Labor party leader, Mark Latham. </p> <p>Michael Howard says he still supports the war, but he attempted to distance himself from the government during the summer by raising doubts about whether he would have voted for the war had he known that no banned weapons would be found. </p> <p>The Tories will hope the appointment of Mr Crosby will show the party wants to concentrate on the sort of \"compassionate Conservatism\" championed by John Howard. </p> <p>But they will also be keen for tips about how John Howard became one of the greatest comeback kids in Australian history. </p> <p>Achieving high office early in life he became leader of the Liberal party, only to be forced out after four years, in 1989. </p> <p>Within six years he was re-elected leader of his party and was swept into power in 1996. </p> <p>William Hague, who along with Michael Howard and Iain Duncan Smith has consulted the Australian prime minister, said John Howard had been ready to offer frank advice to his British counterparts.</p>"
