  "The US will bring up to 70,000 troops home from bases in Europe and Asia over the next few years, moving soldiers away from cold war positions, the US president, George Bush, said today. <p>Mr Bush also announced that another 100,000 family members and civilian support staff would return as overseas bases were closed and consolidated in areas where heavy troop presence was no longer deemed essential. </p> <p>\"For decades, American troops have remained largely where the wars of the last century ended,\" the president told members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars organisation in Ohio. </p> <p>With the threat shifting from feared Soviet aggression to instability in the Middle East and terrorism, Mr Bush said he wanted to reposition troops to create a \"more flexible and agile force\". </p> <p>He said more US troops would be stationed in the US rather than being moved around overseas bases, meaning \"more predictability and fewer moves over a career\". </p> <p>That might win Mr Bush election year applause from military families - but it will not ease the strain on the 150,000 US soldiers battling violent factions in Iraq and Afghanistan. </p> <p>\"The world has changed a great deal, and our posture must change with it - for the sake of our military families, for the sake of our taxpayers, and so we can be more effective at projecting our strength and spreading freedom and peace,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Bush added that the repositioning of forces would help reduce the amount of taxpayers' money spent on maintaining bases overseas. A significant number of soldiers would be sent to bases in the US, although others could be shifted to posts in eastern Europe, White House officials said. </p> <p>A US military official in Berlin today struck a note of caution as the president spoke, saying any shift of major US military units out of western Europe and Asia would take years and would require further negotiation. </p> <p>Even with Mr Bush's endorsement, the plan would be likely to be put into practice only at some time between 2006 and 2011, the official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said.</p> <p>The official added that \"pretty specific details\" had been discussed with the affected countries, but that more talks would be needed to settle details on the \"units, dates and specific numbers\".</p> <p>US armed forces stationed abroad in places other than Iraq and Afghanistan number around 200,000, with around half of those in Europe.</p> <p>Earlier this year, the Pentagon advised German officials that it was considering removing two army divisions from Germany and replacing them with smaller, more mobile units.</p>",
  "Venezuela's leftwing president, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, claimed victory today in a national referendum on his rule, while his opponents charged him with fraud. <p>The Venezuelan electoral commission said that, with 94% of ballots counted, Mr Ch\u00e1vez had secured 58% of the vote. His opponents have 42%.</p> <p>In a speech to thousands of cheering supporters, the president said it was \"impossible\" that his victory could be now reversed.</p> <p>\"Venezuela has changed forever,\" Mr Ch\u00e1vez told the crowd from a balcony of the presidential palace in the pre-dawn darkness. \"There is no turning back.\"</p> <p>Mr Ch\u00e1vez is popular with the poor, but his redirection of oil revenues towards social policies has angered the middle classes, oil producers and some unions.</p> <p>Opposition leaders refused to accept the results and demanded a manual recount, claiming their own exit polls showed almost 60% of citizens voted to oust Mr Ch\u00e1vez.</p> <p>\"We categorically and absolutely reject these results,\" said Henry Ramos Allup, leader of the Democratic Coordinator coalition of opposition parties. \"The national elections council has committed a gigantic fraud.\"</p> <p>The recall vote - which Mr Ch\u00e1vez had to win to stay in power - was expected to be close. A much higher turnout than had been predicted raised fears among the president's campaign team that opposition support had increased.</p> <p>Polling stations stayed open for eight hours more than had been scheduled to allow everyone who wanted to the chance to vote.</p> <p>There was no immediate reaction from former US president Jimmy Carter or C\u00e9sar Gaviria, head of the Organisation of American States, who helped monitor the vote.</p> <p>The OAS independently collects a sampling of results in elections it monitors, but does not release them when they coincide with results announced by local election authorities. The organisation withheld its own results Monday, indicating they coincided at least loosely with the official tally.</p> <p>The presidential recall vote, the first in Venezuela's history, was intended to end two years of sometimes violent protest against Mr Ch\u00e1vez's rule.</p> <p>He was briefly ousted in a 2002 coup, and last year had to battle against a two-month general strike and political riots.</p> <p>Uncertainty over the future of Venezuela, the world's fifth-largest oil exporter, has contributed to record high oil prices, which have reached more than $46 (\u00a325) a barrel.</p>",

  "Tony Blair was waving to the British Olympic team at the opening ceremony in Athens. David Blunkett was bracing himself for a News of the World exclusive about his private life. Meanwhile, the oldest member of the cabinet was pulling an injured kayaker from the rapids near Bala in North Wales. <p>Unlike John Kerry, who once resuscitated a drowning hamster on the shores of a Massachusetts lake, John Prescott was not called upon to perform CPR. But the kayaker - who is thought to have been an East Anglian in his forties - was sufficiently grateful to thank the deputy PM and request a joint photograph.</p> <p>According to the Liverpool Daily Post, the 66-year-old deputy PM was \"revisiting old haunts\" and relatives in North Wales with his wife, Pauline. He saw the kayaker capsize on Friday evening as he was admiring the white-water course at Frongoch.</p> <p>\"While we were standing there this canoe went over and this fella fell out and gashed his forehead,\" Mr Prescott told the paper. \"Blood was coming from his forehead. He's trying to get to the bank and one of the approaching rafts landed on top of him.\"</p> <p>The deputy PM didn't hesitate.</p> <p>\"He got to the quay and one of my special branch guys ran over and grabbed hold of one side. I grabbed hold of the other and we pulled him ashore.</p> <p>\"He was a little bit concussed. I mopped the blood from his face and let him rest for a few minutes and we carried him to the first-aid place and other people took over.\"</p> <p>Undeterred by the experience, the man running the country in Mr Blair's absence put himself at the mercy of the rapids and embarked on a white water-rafting trip. \"I'm going to go back to train in a canoe,\" he told reporters.</p> <p>Water holds no fears for the former National Union of Seamen activist. An accomplished swimmer, diver and snorkeller, Mr Prescott was filmed entertaining several sharks in a tank at Deep Sea World near Edinburgh two years ago.</p> <p>He had a lucky escape during a fact-finding trip to the Maldives while he was environment secretary in 1999. The mask he borrowed for a dive filled with water after he was knocked by a photographer while 30ft underwater. Mr Prescott calmly cleared it and returned to the surface.</p> <p>The deputy PM was born in Prestatyn on the Welsh coast and worked as a porter at the White Lion Royal Hotel in Bala in the 1950s.</p>",
  "Welcome to the Wrap, Guardian Unlimited's round-up of the best of the day's papers. <p><b>BREAKING NEWS:</b> The Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez is reported to have been re-elected. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/\">More news shortly at theguardian.com</a></p> <p> <b>IN SEARCH OF A DECENT SPLASH</b></p> <p>The papers' frantic attempts to dig up a story in the August stillness will hearten Tony Blair as he relaxes in Italy; the problems and concerns they address are so specialised as to suggest that the country might otherwise be working quite well.</p> <p>The Telegraph leads with a YouGov poll which claims to show that people now feel less in touch with their GPs. The Guardian reports that ministers and senior civil servants may soon be able to move into the private sector more quickly, as the prime minister has ordered a review of the arrangements which aim to stop them exploiting their knowledge of government business when they leave their jobs.</p> <p>The FT notes with concern that companies have to fill out a lot of surveys these days, and applauds an initiative by the London Stock Exchange to combat \"survey fatigue\" - surely a term that will now enter the language - by creating the survey to end all surveys.</p> <p>Each paper carefully points out why its story is important. The Telegraph says health is \"high on the agenda for the next election\". The Guardian says \"anti-sleaze watchdogs\" fear that the new arrangements could lead to \"impropriety in dealings between the government and business\". The FT says the requirement to fill in surveys about corporate responsibility is an onerous \"burden of governance\".</p> <p>Among the broadsheets, only the Times finds a straightforward scare story. It says Britains \"risks 'sleepwalking into a surveillance society'\" if government plans to introduce identity cards and a \"population register\" go ahead.</p> <p>The worries come from the government's information commissioner, Richard Thomas, who makes some striking comparisons. \"I don't want to start talking paranoia language,\" he tells the Times, \"but data protection has a strong continental European flavour.\" Mr Thomas goes on to say there are lessons to be learned from the last century in \"eastern Europe and Spain\" - the Times bumps this up to worries about \"Stasi-style snooping\".</p> <p>Intriguingly, the paper offers a separate report on page seven about \"insurance spies\" - a satellite tracking device which could \"save drivers hundreds of pounds\" by calculating their insurance costs based on their actual road use. Sadly, no one asks the information commissioner what he thinks of the idea.</p> <p>The Sun and Mirror pore over the tabloid scoop of the weekend - the News of the World's report that David Blunkett, is dating \"married US beauty\" and publisher of the right-wing Spectator magazine, Kimberly Fortier. The Sun, which is an admirer of the home secretary's tough rhetoric, is sympathetic to their dilemma.</p> <p>* <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/Politics/whitehall/story/0,9061,1284021,00.html\">Plan to end Whitehall sleaze rule</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1218615,00.html\">Times: Beware rise of Big Brother</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2004380693,00.html\">Sun: Blunkett's true love</a><br> * <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml;sessionid=PWT3U4XMFMC5LQFIQMGCM5OAVCBQUJVC?xml=/news/2004/08/16/nhs16.xml&amp;sSheet=/portal/2004/08/16/ixportaltop.html\">Telegraph: GPs 'are losing touch'</a></p> <p><b>NAJAF: ATTACK MAY BE IMMINENT</b></p> <p>The Independent bucks the trend for recondite home news with a muscular front page report on Iraq.

The paper suggests that a \"full-scale assault\" by US forces is in the offing, after Iraqi police ordered all journalists to leave the city, saying \"You have two hours. If you don't leave you will be shot.\"</p> <p>All this is happening in the shadow of talks in Baghdad which are intended to lead Iraq towards democracy. \"Democracy was a long way from Najaf yesterday,\" the paper says gloomily.</p> <p>The Guardian is no less sanguine about the conference, but devotes rather more space to it.

The Independent says Mr Bush may also suffer if voters think he's attempting to exploit the tragedy for electoral gain.</p> <p>The Guardian is more or less alone in devoting a long report to the other big vote in the Americas, the recall referendum in Venezuela which may unseat the country's president, Hugo Chavez.

  "<p>The town clock was still stuck at 4.26pm, the exact time when the sleepy palm-fringed community of Punta Gorda bore the brunt of Hurricane Charley and the 145mph winds that came with it. </p> <p>Yesterday those who survived the storm were counting their blessings and their insurance premiums, and those who were evacuated were tip-toeing back to see what was left of their homes. </p> <p>Hurricane Charley - one of the worst in living memory - has taken at least 20 lives so far, one in Jamaica, three in Cuba and 16 in Florida. Those who perished included some who were hit by falling trees, were flipped over in their trucks as they fled or were electrocuted by fallen power cables. </p> <p>The signposts to Punta Gorda were twisted, as though a retreating army had obscured the route. The trees beside Highway 75 looked as though they had been scythed by some other-worldly chainsaw. All around, in the trailer parks in the main town, mobile homes could be seen to have lived up to their description all too literally. </p> <p>The area has been officially declared a disaster zone, with early estimates suggesting that the damage already runs into billions of dollars. </p> <p>How many people have died here or in other parts of Florida will only be known in the coming days, when workers start sifting through the debris. Health officials in some areas have ordered more body bags, just in case. </p> <p>\"This place will never be the same,\" said Dan Strong, 51, surveying the rubble of what was his house. \"My home and this neighbourhood can be rebuilt, but not like they were. We've lost too much.\" </p> <p>Yesterday, those who survived the winds that tore the town apart on Friday described being terrified by the ferocity of a storm that was not expected to hit Punta Gorda at all. </p> <p>\"When the storm came over, I could see the walls flexing,\" said Nolan Wehmueller, 65, who moved to the area from St Louis, Missouri, 18 years ago. \"It was a terrible noise. You can't even describe. The roof caved in, in the front of the house.\" </p> <p>He had considered the advice to evacuate, but he and his wife stayed because of their animals. \"The storm tore up every tree in the yard and stripped our 80ft Norfolk Island pine like it was a telegraph pole. There were times when we just grabbed pillows and threw them over our heads.\" </p> <p>Kyle Kilgallon, who works in the boat-lifting business, said he had had to sign an affidavit after declining to evacuate so as to take care of a friend in a wheelchair. \"I told my mother it looks like Iraq came over and bombed the shit out of us,\" he said. \"It was like a freight train coming through but the house held up good.\" </p> <p>Wendel Palmer, a restaurateur, from Jamaica, said: \"It was like a good experience because people say you can't see the wind but I saw the wind. It was awesome.\" He said it was important that people realised that \"in Bangladesh they have just had something like this and lots of people were killed so we have to consider ourselves lucky\". </p> <p>Chris Fletcher, manager of the River City Grill, said: \"It was completely unimaginable. This was voted one of the best places to retire to in Money magazine. Rape, murder and mayhem, we don't have that here. It was just a sleepy town. Now we'll have to see what sort of an inner person it brings out in most of us.\" </p> <p>Yesterday was the calm after the storm, with fleets of national guardsmen, tree cutters from Oklahoma City and power trucks arriving to start the rescue. </p> <p>In the morning George Bush arrived in a motorcade, a convoy of flashing blue lights and black four-wheel-drives with radio masts the height of some of the lampposts now lying in the gutters. It was his second visit in less than a week to a crucial state in the presidential election, and he called for \"God's blessings\" on all those hit by the hurricane. </p> <p>With state officials estimating that the damage to property will range from $5bn-$11bn (\u00a32.7bn-\u00a36bn), President Bush said: \"A lot of people's lives are turned upside down.\" </p> <p>When asked whether there were any political undertones to his quick trip to the state, the president said: \"If I didn't come, they would have said we should have been here more rapidly.\" His brother Jeb Bush, Florida's governor, added: \"It's just hard to describe seeing an entire community totally flattened.\" </p> <p>Gabriel Cosea, 21, a local chef offering to help feed the homeless, said the arriving storm had \"a really strong whistle, then you heard everything crash, windows breaking, roofs coming off\". </p> <p>Angie and Britt Matthiessen moved to the area from Georgia, attracted by the palm trees on the main street. They ended up in a shelter as Charley blew most of the trees away. \"We were under the table with an air mattress tied over it,\" Mrs Matthiessen said. Her husband said computer predictions were that the hurricane would strike land 70 miles to the north. \"But it's mother nature; you can't predict with 100% accuracy.\" </p> <p>The sun was shining on Punta Gorda again yesterday as people began clearing up in the wake of a hurricane that made a mockery of human-based predictions.</p>",
  "Venezuela's election authorities struggled to retain control of the country's controversial recall poll yesterday in the face of a massive turnout and delays caused by new technology and absent polling staff. <p>Around 80% of the country's 14 million registered voters took part in the referendum to decide whether to recall the president, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. </p> <p>By midday both sides were privately claiming victory, but a decision to keep polling stations open for an extra four hours meant an official announcement was not expected until the morning. </p> <p>Mr Ch\u00e1vez will step down immediately and new elections will be held within 30 days if those who answer yes in the referendum gain more votes than he won when he was elected in 1998, and also win a majority on the day. </p> <p>If the no votes gain the majority, Mr Ch\u00e1vez has promised he will invite his opponents to lunch at the presidential palace. </p> <p>Shortly before 3pm the president of the national election council, Francisco Carrasquero, appeared on television to play a faked recording of his own voice announcing that Mr Ch\u00e1vez had been defeated and was stepping down with immediate effect. </p> <p>Calling the recording a \"flagrant crime\" which \"pretends to make fun of the will of the people\", he announced the launch of an investigation. </p> <p>The investigation did not take long: it emerged that the recording is a popular spoof sold at street markets. The discovery did little for the credibility of the electoral council. </p> <p>Earlier, as it became clear that the average voter had to stand in line for seven hours to vote, Mr Carrasquero absolved his organisation of the blame for the delays. </p> <p>\"Those who are responsible are the [polling station machine] operators who did not turn up. It seems that some of them were paid not to go,\" he said. </p> <p>Opposition groups pointed to the hi-tech machinery - including electronic voting machines and a more advanced version of the fingerprint recognition system used by US immigration authorities - as being responsible for the delay. </p> <p>The massive turnout was spurred by campaigners on both sides waking their supporters at 3am yesterday with electric horns, bugles and firecrackers. </p> <p>At noon Mr Ch\u00e1vez voted in a working-class Caracas neighbourhood. </p> <p>\"We are very happy,\" he said. \"Today is a very happy day. This is a people in peace giving an example to the rest of the world. The rumours of violence and fraud have been carried away by the winds of reality.\" </p> <p>He dismissed fears that a victory for him might provoke a coup. \"That is now impossible in Venezuela,\" he said. \"The people are too awake. We now have a democracy that is reactivated and full of life.\" </p> <p>By 5am many polling stations in the capital had queues of several hundred people waiting patiently outside. Inside the Colegio Las Acacias, one of 26 polling stations serving the 54,000 residents of the middle-class neighbourhood of San Pedro, observers from the two sides struggled with a roll of sticky tape as they attempted to assemble flat-pack ballot boxes to hold the paper votes. </p> <p>Olivia G\u00fazman, standing outside in the line reserved for pensioners, said: \"You have to be patient. We can do this little by little. I'm not really political but this government has forced me to take more interest. We're in a pit. I've never seen this country in such a bad state. The politicians know that this is a time for reflection and a time for change, for them as much as for anyone.\" </p> <p>In one of the city's com-mercial areas, La Candelaria, hundreds waited to vote at the Colegio Andr\u00e9s Bello. </p> <p>Ra\u00fal Urquia, bearing a purple stain from having his fingerprint taken, was impressed with the system. </p> <p>\"This is much better than anything we've seen before,\" he said. \"This referendum marks a defeat for the coup plotters and for those who think that oil is more important than people.\" </p> <p>Unlike the rest of the tense and acrimonious campaign, the early stages of election day in Caracas were marked by good humour and tolerance. </p> <p>There was a sense among voters that the referendum was an opportunity to give expression to the belief that, far from being a focus for civil unrest and intolerance, the country could reassert itself as a modern, mature democracy. </p> <p>\"All we want is for today to pass peacefully, in complete calm,\" said Carmen Hernandez, queuing outside the polling station at the Asociaci\u00f3n de Mujeres in San Pedro as dawn broke. \"We're not political fanatics, we're responsible citizens. This is a time for change, but within a spirit of reconciliation, a time for Venezuelans to win democracy.\" </p> <p>When former US president Jimmy Carter and former Colombian president C\u00e9sar Gaviria visited La Candelaria in their capacities as heads of the Carter Center and the Organisation of American States respectively, voters burst out in applause. </p> <p>Speaking above the din, Mr Gaviria said: \"We've been across the country and we have not come across any incidents that cause us concern. People are coming in massive numbers to vote, many more than we expected. Finally, this country is going to find what it has been looking for - the political conflicts can be solved through electoral means.\"</p>"
