  "The billionaire philanthropist George Soros has launched a nationwide speaking tour and advertising blitz in an attempt to deliver the Bush defeat he said would be \"the greatest good deed I could do for the world\". <p>Mr Soros, America's 24th richest person, is expected to spend up to $3m (\u00a31.7m) delivering his anti-Bush message in 12 major cities, backing it up with media advertising. </p> <p>The 74-year-old has given $18m to pro-Democratic groups such as Moveon.org, but the new announcement means the financier will be moving personally into the campaign spotlight. </p> <p>\"If I could contribute to repudiating the Bush policies, I think it would be the greatest good deed I could do for the world,\" he said, adding: \"In spite of his Texas swagger, George W Bush does not qualify to serve as our commander in chief.\" </p> <p>He railed at the president's claim that \"either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists,\" and said he was \"undermining the civilised discourse that is the foundation of our democracy\". </p> <p>In a double-page Wall Street Journal advert yesterday, he called the Iraq war \"misconceived from the start\". </p> <p>Mr Soros had cancelled a trip to Russia to campaign for Mr Kerry, he said, because he was no longer as confident as he had been in August that the Massachusetts senator's victory was assured. Slanderous pro-Bush advertising had changed the situation, he said. </p> <p>The Republican party, whose strategists see Mr Soros's involvement as a way to portray Mr Kerry as an out-of-touch elitist - and a foil for attacks linking the Republicans to big business - wasted no time in mocking the speaking tour. </p> <p>\"The only explanation for the Daddy Warbucks of the Democratic party, George Soros, to step out from behind the curtain 35 days before the election is his obvious concern for his investment in John Kerry,\" the Republican National Committee said in a statement. </p> <p>Mr Soros's new initiative would be risky for the Democrats, said Kelly Patterson, director of the centre for the study of elections and democracy at Brigham Young University in Utah. </p> <p>\"When a donor steps out so visibly from behind the scenes, it can give the opposition an opportunity to equate the donor with the campaign,\" he said. </p> <p>\"The Republicans know that George Soros is a very visible figure, in some respects a very controversial figure, and it's still debatable whether or not the massive amounts of money he is putting in will outweigh the potential negative effects this could have.\" </p> <p>Mr Soros has stopped short of criticising the Democratic campaign, but he has hinted that money should play a lesser role in politics. Both camps have raised well in excess of $200m. </p> <p>The election is expected to cost the US more than $1bn for the first time. </p> <p>\"I play by the rules that prevail,\" Mr Soros said. \"I've got a bevy of lawyers making sure that I do. At the same time, I'm in favour of improving the rules.\"</p>",
  "It took them until 1918 to give it to us, but now it seems everyone is after the women's vote. As the US election shuffles closer, American TV stations report that George Bush has inched a three-point lead on John Kerry among women voters. The explanation, apparently, is that married women - who are traditionally more likely to vote than single women - feel more secure with Bush. Which rather goes to show that the Brazilian truly has had its day. Meanwhile, back in Blighty, Labour is desperately trying to woo back disenchanted women voters, a large percentage of whom are unimpressed by Tony Blair. You want my advice, women of Britain? Play hard to get. <p>With all the razzmatazz surrounding Teresa \"Bolshie\" Heinz Kerry and Laura \"Stepford\" Bush, it has been easy to overlook Elizabeth Edwards, witty, feisty, intelligent wife of Kerry's running mate, John Edwards. Edwards, who describes herself as a \"recovering lawyer\", showed her mettle in a recent interview with the New York Times, when asked whether she found it \"hard to play the role of the submissive wife\". \"I didn't know I was,\" she replied wryly, before observing that the acronym for the title \"second lady of the United States\", SLOTUS, \"sounds like something that lives under a rock\". </p> <p>Society is, quite literally, going to the dogs. This week has seen a bevy of naked female pro-hunt supporters flaunting their bottoms and jiggling their bosoms in the name of some vicious toff hobby. Funny how the starchier members of the rightwing press see all this as good, hearty fun. Were ladies thronging the streets of Brighton baring their derrieres in the name of the video game Manhunt, for example, one can't help but feel they'd be altogether less supportive. </p> <p>Figures published this week by the Forensic Science Service claim that 81% of rape victims had been drinking when they were attacked. \"[Young women] need to learn to drink more sensibly, otherwise it is only going to get worse,\" said an FSS spokesperson. One can't argue with the facts, or downplay the need for increased vigilance when out on the tiles and a few shandies the worse for wear. But these statistics shouldn't be manipulated into another slap on the legs for women and the so-called \"ladette\" culture. Surely the people we should be telling to behave themselves are the rapists themselves, not the women they attack. Just a thought. </p> <p>We've had an extraordinary response from those of you who liked the look of our new woman badges. You are a splendid bunch. Special mention goes to Alice McAllister who requests a badge so \"when my four-year-old daughter says, 'I like your new badge,' I can explain what it says and what it means to me, and why I'm proud of it.\" McAllister lists as one of her proudest moments the time her daughter, then three and a half, turned to her and announced, \"Mummy, I really like myself.\" We'd like to nominate that as our mantra for the week. Got a mantra? Do share, at <a href=\"mailto:women@theguardian.com\">women@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "John Prescott wound up the Labour party conference this afternoon with a call for delegates to stop sniping, \"be proud of what we've done\" and rediscover the joys of canvassing. <p>Alluding wryly to the fisticuffs at Rhyl during the 2001 general election, the deputy prime minister held up his fist and a drop-down pledge card and urged Labour campaigners to use them when they knocked on doors during the next general election campaign.</p> <p>To the delight of delegates, Mr Prescott spoke of \"my friend\" John Kerry and attacked the \"compassionate conservatism\" of George Bush. Tony Blair, who sat behind him, joined a choir from Redcar to sing the traditional verse of The Red Flag and, to the evident discomfort of some of the audience, Jerusalem.</p> <p>The deputy prime minister praised the \"good debate\" at the week's gathering in Brighton and warned delegates not to \"tear ourselves apart\" and allow Michael Howard to lead the Conservatives back into power: \"Their principles haven't changed, their values haven't changed.\" </p> <p>He stayed away from the subject of Iraq but said that those who felt \"tempted to dash off a quick article attacking our government in the press\" should \"suppress the urge\" and think again.</p> <p>\"Get out. Meet some voters. Talk to them directly,\" he urged.</p> <p>Earlier, the IPPR thinktank spokesman Richard Darlington described a subdued conference, which had at times been a \"bit flat\" as activists headed north to campaign in the Hartlepool byelection. He singled out Robin Cook's contributions on the fringe circuit as \"very eloquent\" and said the party was in \"uncharted territory\" as it faced the probability of a third term.</p> <p>\"Ken Bigley's continued detention has been ever present in people's minds,\" he said. </p> <p>The IPPR welcomed the announcements on early years childcare and education and were particularly pleased that Labour had not followed the Tories in proposing the abolition of inheritance tax, he said.</p> <p>Jessica Asato, the chair of the Young Fabians, described Bono's speech yesterday as a highlight and said it showed courage on the part of the Labour leadership to allow an outspoken critic of the war to take the stage. But she added that Mr Blair's speech on Tuesday was not as innovative as she had hoped: \"Are these 10 pledges really the best we can do?\"</p> <p>Nonetheless, she said, the week had quelled talk of a leadership challenge from Gordon Brown. \"There are a lot of people going round saying that he's much more left wing than Tony. That's rubbish, he's as New Labour as they come.\"</p> <p>Camberwell and Peckham CLP member, Megan Pacey, said the conference had put international development back at the top of the agenda and ensured Labour was in a \"strong position\" before the next election.</p>",
  "\"Excuse me if I'm nervous,\" said the rock star Bono to the Labour party conference yesterday, \"but I'm not used to speaking to crowds of less than 100,000... \" <p>In the past the guest speakers at Labour conferences were foreign worthies - the leader of the Lithuanian socialist party, for instance. (\"Dear comrades, for us manganese and herring are important factors in our economy... \") Recently, like everything else pertaining to New Labour, the visitors have become more glamorous. Nelson Mandela. Bill Clinton. And yesterday we had the lead singer of U2.</p> <p>For many of us it was a unique opportunity to learn a crucial and little-known fact. Do you pronounce his name with a long \"o\" to rhyme with \"oh, no!\" or a short vowel, to rhyme with \"mono\"? </p> <p>In fact it's the latter, though in my view people with perfectly serviceable names like Paul Hewson should be grateful if we pronounce their mad monickers at all. </p> <p>Sorry, had to get that off my chest. I must say that Mr Hewson gave a brilliant performance. He used self-deprecation, mock vainglory (\"Thank you, you may kneel\" were his opening lines), passion, cajolery, pleading, humour, fawning flattery, and sheer unbridled lunacy. It worked. </p> <p>He appeared in his regulation shades (\"Better go to Specsavers,\" said a colleague near me), with rings in both ears. The conference adored him. This was real glamour, someone from the world of genuine, gold-plated, screaming teens-and-groupies popularity, not the sort of subfusc appeal that coats politicians like a damp anorak. </p> <p>There is a certain template for rock idols' speeches on poverty, created by Bob Geldof. The hoarse voice. The scarcely banked fires of rage as the troubadour contemplates the injustice - the obscenity - of famine and disease. The use of swear words to imply incoherent anger, and to draw a contrast with the mumbling evasions of politicians - his prepared script was liberally spattered with cries of \"horseshit\", though for some reason this became \"bollocks!\" at the podium. </p> <p>The truly bonkers part of the speech came when he started to praise \"two remarkable men ... who didn't always get along. They didn't always agree ... but they did their best work as a pair. I love them both. John Lennon and Paul McCartney. </p> <p>\"I am also fond of Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. They are kind of the John and Paul of global development ... Lennon and McCartney changed my interior world - Blair and Brown can change the real world.\" </p> <p>At this the prime minister and his chancellor looked transcendentally happy. A star was sprinkling stardust upon them! The rest of us could only gaze open-mouthed, and reflect that Gordon Brown might be a truculent old bugger, but at least he never inflicted The Frog Chorus on anyone. </p> <p>Anyhow, Bono's obvious sincerity and commitment, and his flattery to the party - \"You are tough ... Labour has never been a garden party\" - made the conference very happy and as pleased with themselves as they were with him. </p> <p>If Blair and Brown are John and Paul, then who is the Ringo of the cabinet? Possibly Charles Clarke. </p> <p>The education secretary treated us to a PowerPoint presentation demonstrating how, under his aegis, all children would shortly get 10 starred As at GCSE, especially if they lived on a sink estate. </p> <p>His last slide purported to show a handwritten note he had received from the prime minister. \"Charles,\" it read in the familiar spiky handwriting. \"A lot done. A lot more to do. Tony.\" </p> <p>This is another of those scrawls we doubt were ever scrawled. How did he send it? What's wrong with email? Or a phone call? </p> <p>And would we ever have been shown this historic document if it had read \"Charles. Sod all done. Pack it in. Tony\"?</p>",
  "When addressing the United Nations general assembly earlier this week, Indonesia's foreign minister, Hassan Wirajuda, described the current political events in his country as a \"magnificent transformation\". <p>For once, such prose is no exaggeration. Only six years after casting off the shackles of deeply-entrenched authoritarianism, Indonesians have gone to the polls three times in six months and elected themselves both a parliament and, for the first time in their history, a president. </p> <p>The orderliness of the elections, particularly the presidential run-off on September 20 - which was the world's largest direct presidential election involving some 155 million registered voters - was exemplary. Yes, there were hiccups and minor rule violations but nothing of great significance. </p> <p>Indeed, the archipelago with the nascent democracy, the country bedevilled by political, social, ethnic and economic crises, put the so-called \"more mature\" democracies in neighbouring Singapore, Malaysia and the Philippines (where manipulation, if not blatant fraud are commonplace) to shame. </p> <p>That's the good news. The better news, for fans of presidential challenger Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, is that he won a massive 61% of the vote, arguably the largest share possible in a free and fair election. </p> <p>How the retired general, who took time out from campaigning two days before the election to defend his PhD thesis in rural economics, will use his mandate is the question now on everybody's lips. </p> <p>Western logic suggests Mr Yudhoyono can throw his reformist weight around to ensure promised reforms get enacted, particularly if challenged by recalcitrant legislators. </p> <p>But Indonesia's culture of consensus-building and his own ministerial track record suggests he is more likely to tread a gentler approach, especially as his own Democratic party controls only 11% of parliament, while the coalition of parties that backed President Megawati Sukarnoputri in the presidential election have more than 300 of the 550 seats. </p> <p>Complicating the analysis is the fact that Indonesian politicians are playing with a new rulebook that has yet to be completed. </p> <p>Not only has the president been chosen directly for the first time but the new members of parliament, some 60% of whom are \"freshmen\", were elected in a more democratic way, making them more accountable to their constituents. Whether this means they will behave more responsibly remains to be seen but it is a step in the right direction. </p> <p>Moreover, the country also has a brand new upper house, the Regional Representatives Assembly. While its powers on paper are limited, no one has any idea how it will flex its \"advisory\" muscles. </p> <p>So everything is to play for but everyone will undoubtedly be waiting to see what sort of leader Mr Yudhoyono proves to be. </p> <p>That is still hard to gauge, despite the fact that the election results have been clear for more than a week, because he has refused to comment on much while Ms Megawati refuses to concede, pending the official declaration of the result. That is due on October 5. </p> <p>Titbits of policy direction are emerging, however. Aides say everything will stem from Mr Yudhoyono's ultimate priority of job creation.</p> <p>Some 40 million Indonesians are either under or unemployed and about 40% of the 220 million population are living on less than $2 (\u00a31.11) a day. </p> <p>His problem is lack of money. To set the foundations of a post-economic crisis recovery, Indonesia has over the last few years had to prioritise macro-economic stability. The result has been more money going into pay debts and stabilising the banking sector than funding development programmes. At the same time desperately-needed foreign investors have been leaving Indonesia, driven away by crippling legal uncertainty, unpredictable corruption and punitive labour legislation. </p> <p>People close to the incoming president say more money will be found from streamlining the notoriously venal customs and taxation systems, changing labour law by executive decree (and so bypassing parliament), and gradually raising fuel prices for all but the poorest in society. </p> <p>In parallel to this, the attorney general will be ordered to prosecute some of the \"biggest fish\" as an opening salvo in the war against corruption. The judiciary is also likely to face a radical overhaul. </p> <p>Issues such as resolving the 28-year-old separatist conflict in Aceh and the war on Islamist terrorism will almost certainly take a back seat. </p> <p>Will Mr Yudhoyono succeed in achieving his goals, such as raising GDP from \u00a3538 per capita to \u00a3962 in five years? It's impossible to tell because he is relatively untested. </p> <p>But if he can manage people's sky-high aspirations and persuade them to take some painful medicine early on then he has a good chance, because he has few political debts, much goodwill behind him and that massive mandate to fall back on.</p>",
  "In my lifetime, only one Democrat who was not from the American south has won the presidency. And the Democrat who did so, John F Kennedy, accomplished this feat when I was two months old. <p>Since then, many have concluded that it's impossible for a Democrat to win the south unless - like Bill Clinton or Jimmy Carter - he has southern roots. (Al Gore, who hails from Carthage, Tennessee but who spent much of his childhood in a posh Washington hotel, apparently wasn't southern enough.)</p> <p>But why would that be? It can't be because southerners won't vote for people from outside the south. After all, they happily voted in droves for Ronald Reagan, a Californian transplanted from the midwest. Nor is it likely to be because of \"traditional values\", since southerners also voted for Bill Clinton, a Democrat whose commitment to monogamy was famously shaky.</p> <p>And, at any rate, the south's commitment to traditional values is, like Bill Clinton's, less strong than many might believe. Dayton, Tennessee - home of the Scopes \"monkey trial\", depicted entertainingly in Inherit the Wind, and more accurately in Ed Larson's book, A Summer for the Gods, - recently sponsored a <a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/news/archive/2004/05/08/national1634EDT0574.DTL\">\"Gay Day\"</a> after overturning local anti-gay legislation. And, although driving around the rural parts of east Tennessee (which I do a lot, in the process of taking photographs like <a href=\"http://instapun.exposuremanager.com\">these</a>) will expose you to a lot of church signs, most of them are rather sweet, really, and hellfire-and-brimstone is much rarer than most foreigners, or even Americans from the east and west coasts, might believe.</p> <p>So what is it about the south? I think it's defence. Some time between the election of John F Kennedy, and the ignominious defeat of 1972 Democratic nominee George McGovern, the Democrats lost credibility on national defence. From Kennedy's stirring <a href=\"http://www.bartleby.com/124/pres56.html\">\"bear any burden, pay any price\"</a> language, to the \"peace at any price\" slogans of the anti-war left in 1972, the Democrats lost their traditional stature as the internationalist and interventionist war party. Instead, they became identified with the welfare-state liberalism of the north-east and west coast, and with the anti-military sentiments of the anti-Vietnam war movement. </p> <p>Southern candidates offer a presumption of manliness that offsets these problems, at least somewhat. (Having worked for Al Gore in 1988, and a bit for Clinton in 1992, I remember a phone call in which I told Clinton strategist Bruce Reed that they needed to push Clinton's masculinity in that campaign. Show him lifting weights, or something. Don't worry, responded Reed, a shortage of testosterone isn't his problem. Truer than I realised, at the time.)</p> <p>To understand the American south's role on defence, it's helpful to look at what political scientist Walter Russell Mead calls the \"Jacksonian tradition\" in foreign affairs. Because when Zell Miller - a Democrat from Georgia who is deeply unhappy with his party on matters of national defence - delivered the <a href=\"http://www.newsday.com/news/politics/rnc/nyc-zellspeech,0,2788444.story?coll=ny-nationalnews-headlines\">keynote address</a> at the Republican national convention, he spoke in the purest tones of Jacksonian America.</p> <p>Jacksonians (as Mead explains in <a href=\"http://globetrotter.berkeley.edu/people3/Mead/mead-con3.html\">this interview</a>) aren't very interested in foreign affairs, but respond vigorously to threats:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"[The idea is]: Don't bother with people abroad, unless they bother you. But if they attack you, then do everything you can ... When somebody attacks the hive, you come swarming out of the hive and you sting them to death. And Jacksonians, when it comes to war, don't believe in limited wars. They don't believe, particularly, in the laws of war. War is about fighting, killing, and winning with as few casualties as possible on your side. But you don't worry about casualties on the other side. That's their problem. They shouldn't have started the war if they didn't want casualties.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>How much this idea has to do with Andrew Jackson, really, is open for debate. (He was rather abominable to my Cherokee ancestors, even though they had long since turned non-threatening.) But as a strain of American thought it's quite strong. And it's particularly strong in the American south, perhaps because the south is the only part of America that knows what it's like to lose a war and be occupied. (There's a much longer explication of Mead's theories in his book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0375412301/qid=1062393937/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_1/102-2870732-8742509?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846\">Special Providence</a>, which might profitably be compared with historian David Hackett Fischer's <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0195069056/qid=1094133446/sr=8-1/ref=pd_ka_1/103-1545606-9973455?v=glance&amp;s=books&amp;n=507846\">Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America</a>, which links Jacksonian ideas about war with the experience of the \"Scots Irish\" - really English/Scottish borderers - who settled the American south, and who brought experience of being on the losing side in rather brutal warfare with them when they came.) </p> <p>Whatever the reason, it seems that not just southerners, but many other Americans, believe that a president from the south is likely to be tougher in wartime than one from the north, enough so to offset Democrats' generally weaker credentials in this area.</p> <p>Do southerners deserve this additional credibility? Perhaps not. One of the strongest Jacksonian statements in American history came from Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who, like John Kerry, was a wealthy north-eastern aristocrat. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Roosevelt <a href=\"http://www.pearlharbor.org/speech-fdr-infamy-1941.asp\">declared:</a></p> <blockquote> <p>\"As commander-in-chief of the army and navy, I have directed that all measures be taken for our defence. But always will our whole nation remember the character of the onslaught against us.</p> <p>No matter how long it may take us to overcome this premeditated invasion, the American people in their righteous might, will win through to absolute victory.</p> <p>I believe that I interpret the will of the Congress and of the People when I assert that we will not only defend ourselves to the uttermost, but will make it very certain that this form of treachery shall never again endanger us.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>It's hard to imagine similar words from the lips of Jimmy Carter, notwithstanding his southern roots. The challenge for John Kerry will be to convince American voters that he has more in common with Franklin than with Jimmy.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Glenn Reynolds, a law professor at the University of Tennessee, runs the <a href=\"http://instapundit.com/\">instapundit.com</a> US political blog</p> <p>Respond to this article <a href=\"http://blogs.theguardian.com/news/archives/us_elections/2004/09/songs_about_the_southland.html\">here</a>.</p>",
  "Al Gore, who lost to George Bush in the US presidential election four years ago, has this advice for the Democratic contender, John Kerry, in tonight's debate - attack the president's record. <p>Mr Gore, who performed disastrously in his own primetime confrontations with Mr Bush, believes Mr Kerry has plenty of material to work with, ranging from the quagmire in Iraq to reckless tax breaks to the \"jobless economic recovery.\"</p> <p>It is worthy advice, but it somehow misses the point. Mr Kerry is not unlike Mr Gore - stuffy, wooden and long-winded. A creature of the senate, where verbosity is an occupational hazard, he can take exasperatingly long to get to the point. </p> <p>Mr Bush, by contrast, speaks in short declarative sentences - like most normal people - and Americans forgive him his mangled syntax because he comes across as someone with whom you could share a Bud. Mr Kerry may be highly intelligent and thoughtful, but he does not come across as a regular Joe - an act the president has honed to perfection.</p> <p>Yes, it is vital for Mr Kerry to go after Mr Bush for his policy failures in Iraq and for the tax cuts that have pushed US budget deficits into the stratosphere. However, more crucially, he has to lighten up, crack a few jokes, and show that there is some human warmth behind that Mount Rushmore fa\u00e7ade.</p> <p>This may seem ridiculously trite on such an important occasion, but the history of past debates shows that a well-delivered zinger can be deadly effective, winning over the millions watching. </p> <p>Walter Mondale has said he knew he had lost his 1984 debate with the avuncular Ronald Reagan - and the election - when the 73-year-old Republican incumbent, with all his Hollywood experience, delivered this killer line: \"I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience.\" </p> <p>As the audience chuckled, all the 53-year-old could do was smile sheepishly. </p> <p>There was no comeback for Mr Mondale, who previously had seen off his Democratic rival, Gary Hart, with a line from a Wendy's burger ad, no less: \"Where's the beef.\" Delivered in a Democratic TV debate, the remark reinforced perceptions that, for all his policy wonkery, Mr Hart lacked substance.</p> <p>One of the most electrifying moments in political TV debates occurred during the encounter between Lloyd Bentsen, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, and the vacuous Dan Quayle. Mr Bentsen, running mate to the hapless Michael Dukakis in 1988, absolutely skewered Mr Quayle when the Republican had the temerity to compare himself with John Kennedy.</p> <p>Treating him like a jumped-up schoolboy, Mr Bentsen thundered: \"Senator, I served with Jack Kennedy. I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy.\" </p> <p>Unsaid things matter, too. Because this is television, appearance and gestures are important. Richard Nixon's five o'clock shadow reinforced his Tricky Dick image in the debate with John Kennedy. George Bush Sr made himself look silly when he glanced down at his watch towards the end of a debate with Bill Clinton, a gesture that screamed: \"Get me out of here.\" </p> <p>In tonight's debate, Mr Kerry could do worse than steal one of Ronald Reagan's lines from his 1980 debate with Jimmy Carter - the pair's only debate. On that occasion, Reagan convinced Americans he had the gravitas to be president, turning a close race into an electoral landslide. </p> <p>Americans will remember Reagan's famous question attacking Mr Carter's record, all the more effective because it was a rapier thrust rather than a sledgehammer blow. Looking directly at the camera, he asked: \"Are you better off now than you were four years ago?\"</p> <p>The race is still close - there are a lot of undecided voters out there. Tonight is a real opportunity for Mr Kerry to turn on the charm. He has a reputation for finishing strongly, a quality he showed when coming from behind in the primaries. </p> <p>And he should not be underestimated. In TV interviews, he has shown the ability to deliver sharp, pithy responses to pointed questions. He can think on his feet, much more so than Mr Bush. As the man entering tonight's debate with low expectations, which probably suits him, Mr Kerry may have some surprises for the president.</p>",
  "<p>One Bush strategist calls him \"the best debater ever to run for president\" and \"better than Cicero\", so you would imagine the first of the televised presidential debates tonight would be a walkover for John Kerry. But, as Al Gore has <a href=\"http://www.iht.com/articles/541119.html\">commented</a>, the Bush campaign \"has made lowering expectations into a high art form\", and the president is a formidable presence despite the word-mangling stereotypes. He told Mr Kerry to be prepared for the \"toughest debates of your career\".</p> <p>The consensus is that with George Bush's lead appearing to be consolidated, this is Mr Kerry's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uselections2004/story/0,13918,1316018,00.html\">high noon</a>. The <strong>Washington Post</strong> describes the months the two candidates have spent honing soundbites and speeches as \"an out-of-town tryout for a Broadway show\" where, it warns, both may make assertions that later turn out to be exaggerated or wrong. <strong>Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting</strong>, a campaign group, has put out a <a href=\"http://www.fair.org/press-releases/debate-fact-checking.html\">statement</a> asking the media to focus its post-debate coverage on fact checking.</p> <p>Ever since John Kennedy showed himself better suited to the television age than Richard Nixon (sadly, the best I can find is an <a href=\"http://www.jfklibrary.org/60-1st.htm\">audio file</a>) a mythology has grown up surrounding the quick-witted line or election-losing reaction, such as Mr Gore rolling his eyes and sighing in his first debate against Mr Bush in 2000. </p> <p>But it is more than just the 90 minutes on camera; when the candidates leave the stage, the spin cycle takes over as the rival campaigns and pundits battle over the interpretation, amplifying the impact of supposed gaffes or killer comebacks and, as <strong>ABC</strong> suggests, <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/sections/US/Vote2004/debate_zingers_040930-1.html\">maybe even choosing a new winner</a>. A debate, after all, is a lot more than a shoot-out.</p>",

  "Should we trust him? It is, as Tony Blair himself admits, the critical question now. That he has lost trust over the war in Iraq is indisputable. Equally indisputable is that, for now, his party is giving him the benefit of the doubt. The support, though, has come at a price - some significant shifting by the party leader. <p>What's been apparent this week is that for the first time in his 10 years as Labour leader, Blair needs the party more than the party needs him. And so, this week, we have seen a very different Tony Blair. His speech to the conference was, thank God, not the usual vaulting, attitude-striking Tony. Instead of picking a fight with his party, he has been forced to adopt a tone we have never heard from him before. His aides called it \"conversational\". And what is a conversation? Two-sided, that's what.</p> <p>For many of us who opposed the war on Iraq, Blair's sort-of apology was not enough. He did go much further than he has ever done before in admitting mistakes, but to shrug and say: \"Oh well, we're better off without Saddam\" is just not good enough. He didn't apologise for the great blunder of going to war, not against the international terrorist network of al-Qaida, but against Bush's own personal demon of Saddam's Iraq - horrible, but not a threat to us. </p> <p>He declined to address the crucial issue of his relationship with, and uncritical support for, the most rightwing president America has seen for many years. And Blair did his case no favours either by his fundamentalist division of the world into \"us and them\", goodies and baddies. Lumping in Afghanistan, Chechnya, Iraq and many points east into one evil cauldron was a gross over-simplification of world affairs. Talking around the conference afterwards, many people seemed to think that too. </p> <p>Yet, as yesterday's manoeuverings to prevent a conference vote on Iraq showed, there is no real appetite in the party for humiliating Blair further on this issue, and certainly not for ditching him. The reason, and the big unspoken story of this conference, is the power of the trade unions. They may no longer dominate the television coverage, with their block votes and their smoke-filled rooms, but four union leaders are now more influential at the Labour party conference than ever before. </p> <p>With the mergers of so many of the smaller unions into four big giants, Tony Woodley of the Transport Workers, Kevin Curran of the GMB, Dave Prentis of Unison and Derek Simpson of Amicus between them carry 42% of the votes at conference. And they have decided to stick with Blair.</p> <p>They have won concessions. Partly because Blair is so aware that he's lost trust, he has had to turn and appeal directly to the party as a whole, jettisoning the \"new\" through most of his hour-long address, and return to that old, fine notion of plain Labour. For once he spoke about cleaners, dinner ladies and security guards rather than middle England. </p> <p>He offered the trade unions a long list of what the government has done for them, and reasserted the deal done at Warwick. He talked the Labour language of greater equality, and smashing glass ceilings, and he articulated the priorities of ordinary families. He managed not to bang on too much about complex market mechanisms and choice, except to insist it wasn't a Tory word. Instead, we got a meaty list of commitments about 18-week maximum waiting lists and 200 new hospitals, about childcare for a full working day, about equal pay, about more school sport, and about a better deal for pensioners. </p> <p>I can see a big row looming over incapacity benefit, and it isn't clear what he means on pensions, but it sounded like common sense, Labour ambitions - not clever-dick ideology. For most Labour people, Iraq apart, this had not a divisive syllable. It was Blair's gift-horse to the party. The question is: how should the party react? </p> <p>Check out the dentures very carefully is one obvious reply. The speech could simply represent a moment in Blair's era when he happens to feel insecure and beset, a blip during which he thought it politic to be polite. Maybe, following a thumping election victory, he will simply revert to type, and we'll be back to Blair the market radical, openly disdainful of many Labour instincts. Maybe there will be some attempted ideological putsch of Blairite ultras to come. </p> <p>But I don't think so. To reject this gift-horse, curmudgeonly and suspicious, is the wrong response. Better, and shrewder is to take him at his public word. For the truth is that after Iraq, Blair can never quite recover. That little core of wonks, market liberal advisers and clever-dicks is now too fragile and uncertain to control the rest of the rocket. They are scattering, to Brussels and private-sector enrichment. </p> <p>Blair, left behind, really does need the solid instincts and power of the labour movement to win seriously well again. He knows it. So did the people in the hall. So the balance of power has shifted away from the ultra-modernising clique in favour of the real Labour middle-ground - all those decent, progressive, unshowy people who have been getting on with trying to drive forward equal pay, childcare, a better pensions deal. </p> <p>The likeliest outcome at the next election, everyone agrees, is a Labour majority, but a much smaller one than Blair enjoys now. Because many of the ultra-Blairite loyalists are in seats which are likely to be lost, the back-Blair-at-any-price section of the PLP will be even more reduced. By erosion, the party is going to get its government back. By force of gravity and time, the abnormal landslide politics of the past seven years, which gave No 10 such leeway, are going to settle down. </p> <p>Those who argue that, really, there's no difference between Blair and Brown, are wrong. We know that their basic political instincts are different, and that Blair is far more comfortable in the world of consumerism and private enrichment than is the chancellor. Brown believes in the power of the state to reshape millions of lives; Blair says he does but, with his market instincts, never seems quite to believe it. And that is a real difference. So those tensions aren't going to disappear. Nor are the personal suspicions. </p> <p>But the idea that the Labour party can simply be captured and, like a huge dumb robot, have its wiring altered and be sent in a completely different direction for ever... that idea, so widely believed for so many years, has died this week. So, too, has the idea nurtured by some that Gordon Brown could be despatched to the history books. In the end, whether the Labour government is led by Blair, Brown or anyone else, is therefore now going to matter a bit less (though we can all have our prejudices).</p> <p>What matters is that the party remembers the tone and promises made here this week. They have chosen to trust Blair. The voters, of course, may see it differently, but that is the gamble the party has chosen to take. Now they have to make him keep his promises. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:jackie.ashley@theguardian.com\">jackie.ashley@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "After months of exchanging insults from a distance, George Bush and John Kerry will finally face each other tonight in a debate that is likely to be the challenger's best chance to turn the election around before the November 2 poll. <p>The debate, at the University of Miami, is the first of three, but it will have the biggest audience - up to 50 million Americans - and it deals with the issue at the heart of this presidential election: national security, Iraq and the \"war on terror\". </p> <p>Senator Kerry enters the 90-minute debate having consistently trailed in the polls for the past month, and is currently behind by about half a dozen percentage points. Democrats complain he has allowed the White House to define him - as a wavering, uncertain leader - and that he, in turn, has failed to define a president who continues to project steadfast resolve in the minds of a majority of Americans. </p> <p>The Miami debate will be Mr Kerry's best, and possibly final, opportunity to turn the tables on his opponent on the issue that matters most. </p> <p>\"This debate is by far and away the most important,\" said Thomas Steinfatt, a University of Miami communications professor, adding that the White House could even try to pull out of the next two encounters if it did not go well. </p> <p>The Bush camp has already hinted it might do that if television companies stray from the rigid rules on coverage, banning shots of one candidate reacting to the others remarks. </p> <p>\"Kerry certainly can't lose this one,\" Prof Steinfatt said. \"If the polls after two days showed that Bush has extended his lead, I would say Kerry was done.\" </p> <p>The second debate, in St Louis on Friday week, will be a less-focused \"town meeting\" encounter with questions on a wide variety of subjects from an invited audience. The final debate, the week after, will dwell on the economy and domestic issues. These have been displaced from centre stage by the bloodshed in Iraq and the ever-present fear of another terrorist attack. </p> <p>Both candidates are arguably unbeaten in head-to-head debates, but they enter the chamber tonight with vulnerabilities. </p> <p>The Massachusetts senator faces a particularly tough challenge. While President Bush just has to stay the same - stick to his message and avoid being knocked off balance - Mr Kerry has to change. </p> <p>\"He tends to be long-winded. As a TV persona he's a bit stiff and formal and it doesn't work well,\" said Alan Schroeder, a journalism professor and the author of Presidential Debates: 40 Years of High-Risk TV. </p> <p>Mr Kerry has a deserved reputation for sentences tangled with parenthetical asides which have helped the Bush campaign paint him as a waffler. A comic radio sketch this week had his campaign aides inflicting an electric shock on the candidate each time he used a subordinate clause, until he finally spat out a declarative sentence. </p> <p>But the senator also a reputation for sharpening his game, and his vocabulary, in the last weeks of a campaign when his back is against the wall. He did it in 1996, when he was in danger of losing his Senate seat to a sharp-witted Republican, William Weld. </p> <p>Over the course of a marathon eight debates, Mr Kerry asserted himself, proving himself most effective when put on the spot. </p> <p>At one point Mr Weld challenged him on his opposition to the death penalty and pointed to the mother of a murdered policeman, asking the senator if he thought the murderer's life was worth more than his victim's. </p> <p>\"I know something about killing,\" Mr Kerry responded, in a characteristic reference to his Vietnam days. \"I don't like killing. I don't think a state honours life by turning around and sanctioning killing.\" </p> <p>\"Kerry is a master of the fine art of changing the subject,\" Mr Weld said recently. \"By the time he finished, everyone had forgotten what the question was.\" </p> <p>Jeff Shesol, a speechwriter for President Bill Clinton, agreed that Mr Kerry's verbosity was being overplayed. \"He's not going to fall into sort of meanderings he makes in a speech. He's less likely to do that in a debate format. He seems to have a real understanding of what that format requires.\" </p> <p>Mr Bush has also shown he is aware of what is expected of him. In past debates he has stuck with unerring discipline to his talking points and shown himself capable of projecting his \"regular guy\" image through the staged formality of such events to the studio and television audiences. </p> <p>But in the past he has always been the underdog, famous for his mangled use of English, and has successfully lowered expectations so he could beat them. His aides have attempted to do the same this year, even describing Mr Kerry as \"better than Cicero\", but it has not worked. </p> <p>A Gallup poll this week showed that 44% of Americans expect the president to win , compared with 32% for Mr Kerry. </p> <p>After four years in office, Mr Bush can no longer convincingly play the role of newcomer, and will have a record to defend. The president has been rattled before, most memorably when Senator John McCain attacked his campaign tactics in the 2000 Republican primary. </p> <p>Mr Kerry's background as a courtroom prosecutor could help him capitalise on that potential vulnerability. But the groundrules, hammered out over weeks of negotiation, help the incumbent. Neither candidate is allowed to ask the other a direct question. </p> <p>Perhaps the biggest challenge both men will face tonight is overcoming the sheer weight of all their preparations. \"You want your candidate to be prepared but you also want him to be loose, and those two objectives are often at odds,\" Mr Shesol said. </p> <p>\"There's a danger of being so heavily coached that you're just trying to remember your lines rather than responding to the moment. You've got to be nimble, and you've got to listen.\"</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> <b> September 1960</b> Richard Nixon v John F Kennedy: Nixon refused make-up. Kennedy's delivery was smooth and charismatic.

  "Rarely have delegates to a party conference had such potential to influence the course of history as they do today. In Labour's debate on the occupation of Iraq, the party will confront the biggest question facing the country: will Britain continue to follow the lead of President Bush, or will it change course and help to give the Iraqi people the chance to determine their own future? Ominously for the prospects of Labour and the government - as well as for the future of Iraq - it looks likely that delegates will vote to back the continued bloody occupation of the land of my birth to save the prime minister's political skin. <p>There are now two Iraq wars: the first is being fought with helicopter gunships and cluster bombs along the banks of the Tigris and Euphrates; the second is being fought here in Britain and in the pre-election US. This is a propaganda war in which the hundreds of Iraqis killed every week by US bombardment fail to make the headlines, while the horrifying images provided by a Jordanian kidnapper and killer of British and US contractors is portrayed as the true face of Iraqi resistance. Thus the real human suffering, and the reality of the widespread resistance to occupation, is hidden from view, while bombing what US generals call Abu Musab al-Zarqawi's \"supporters' hideouts\" is portrayed as a necessity. And so Falluja, a besieged city of 300,000 people, is under daily aerial attack, and parts of Sadr City, the poorest neighbourhood of Baghdad, are being reduced to rubble. Many towns and villages across Iraq are encircled, and thousands of people arrested to crush popular resistance to occupation. </p> <p>The vast majority of Iraqis reject Zarqawi and his ilk - as do the resistance and its supporters in Falluja, Sadr City and across Iraq. Many even suspect that the occupation forces are somehow encouraging the likes of Zarqawi, or at least failing to prevent their crimes, as a way of obscuring the fact that most Iraqis now actively support a patriotic and widespread resistance movement. </p> <p> The occupation forces have admitted that the attacks on them by the resistance rose last month to 2,700. And how many of these 2,700 attacks a month were claimed by Zarqawi? Six. Six headline-grabbing, TV-dominating, stomach-churning moments. </p> <p>Just as Iraq's 25 million people were reduced, in the public's mind, to the threat from weapons of mass destruction, ready to be unleashed within 45 minutes, the resistance is now being reduced to a single hoodlum. </p> <p>Meanwhile, in the name of building democracy, the Iraqi people's democratic rights have been crushed. Instead of an elected constitutional assembly we have a CIA-appointed puppet government. Trade union leaders have been detained by the occupation forces and their offices destroyed. The US proconsul Paul Bremer, and later the US-appointed Ayad Allawi regime, have reintroduced a 1987 law of Saddam's banning strikes in the state sector. </p> <p>Iraqi workers are nevertheless fighting back. Last month the Southern Oil Company Union staged a successful strike to halt oil exports and help force the US to lift its bombardment of Najaf. But Labour's conference will hear little or nothing of this, whether from Tony Blair and his ministers or from pro-occupation Iraqis masquerading as supporters of free trade unionism and self-determination in Iraq. </p> <p>Such insidious misrepresentation of reality helps keep people of conscience in Britain and the US from having sleepless nights about the children daily killed in their name or the trade unionists hounded by Saddamist torturers enlisted by the occupation. </p> <p>One might regret this \"collateral damage\", the government argues, but it is all in a good cause: fighting not against the Iraqi people, but to save them from Zarqawi. </p> <p>Britain is morally and politically responsible for the current US bombardment of Iraqi cities. Indeed, Britain's role in the war is now politically decisive. The announcement of a phased British withdrawal, to be completed by the end of the year, would be the desperately needed move to force President Bush to change direction. </p> <p>The impact of such a decision on the US public would be huge. Blair, speaking on behalf of the British people, played a key role in helping Bush dupe America about WMD. Were that support withdrawn, Bush would either have to change direction or risk losing the election. The impact on Democrat candidate Kerry's campaign would surely be no less dramatic, forcing him to accept that the Iraqi people's struggle for freedom is unstoppable. Once free, the Iraqi people would certainly sweep away Zarqawi's tiny gang, who appear to have little trouble slipping in and out of Iraq under the occupation regime. </p> <p>Labour delegates have it in their gift today to hold their leaders to account and uphold the cause of peace and self-determination. If they fail to seize that chance, we are all likely to pay the price. </p> <p>\u00b7 Sami Ramadani was a political refugee from Saddam Hussein's regime and is a senior lecturer at London Metropolitan University </p> <p> <a href=\"mailto:sami.ramadani@londonmet.ac.uk\">sami.ramadani@londonmet.ac.uk</a></p>",
  "All politics may be local, but a parliamentary byelection is inevitably both a local and a national event at the same time. Today's Hartlepool contest embodies that double identity as few recent byelections have done, not least because of the exceptional profile of the man whose departure from parliament has caused it. But it is not Peter Mandelson's shadow which hangs over today's election as much as those of Tony Blair and the Iraq war. This byelection does not belong to Hartlepool alone. It also belongs to us. <p>A byelection is not a general election. It is not an occasion for selecting a government or for deciding a programme for a parliament. It does not even decide the fate of a government or its leader. Nor should it do so on this occasion. At its most basic, a byelection is simply an occasion to bring the parliamentary numbers up to strength. Labour's already massive majority will not be affected by the result tonight. But a byelection is also an opportunity for sending a modest but sharp message to the existing political establishment. That is the particular opportunity that has fallen to the voters of Hartlepool to deliver on our behalf today. </p> <p>Members of parliament always have two responsibilities. Their first responsibility is to represent their constituents. But their second is to hold the government of the day to account for its plans and actions. Since 2001, MPs have too often failed in that task. True, theirs is part of a wider failure. Britain's traditional institutions of scrutiny and accountability - parliament, cabinet government, the civil service, select committees, the law, public inquiries - were all found wanting both before and after the Iraq war. </p> <p>But MPs bear a particular responsibility. Their essential collective purpose is to control the executive. They are the highest court in the land. They could have stopped the war. They could have shone the light unremittingly on the government's actions before, during and after the conflict. When parliament returns the week after next, MPs again have opportunities. They can demand an immediate statement from the prime minister about the secret assurances of British support he gave to President Bush before the war. And they can force a commitment not to support future unilateral action against Iran. </p> <p>Today the voters of Hartlepool have the chance to send a message about the kind of parliament this country really needs. Such chances do not come often. Today, though, their town is in the spotlight and their message can make a difference. If they want to elect a 407th Labour MP, to add to the 406 already on the Labour benches at Westminster, then that is their privilege. On the basis of the domestic policies promoted at Brighton this week, there would normally be logic in such a choice. But before they do that, do the voters of Hartlepool not need to ask themselves whether one more Labour MP will make a difference? </p> <p>If this newspaper had a vote in Hartlepool today, it would go to the Liberal Democrats. It would go to them not because we have a view about the candidates' personalities. Nor because we think that Liberal Democrat policies for Hartlepool are demonstrably preferable to those of any other party. That is not the case either. Nor because we think that Britain should have a Liberal Democrat government. We still support most of the aims of this Labour government. The Liberal Democrats, though, are the one party to have consistently opposed the war and to have consistently tried to hold the executive to account. This election is about the effectiveness of parliament. Only the Lib Dems have provided any kind of effective opposition over Iraq. It would be a win they deserve. If you want a parliament that is a bit more worthy of this country, then Hartlepool should today send Jody Dunn to Westminster as its Liberal Democrat MP.</p>",
  "<p>Chris Schofield, English cricket's great leg-spin hope when he was awarded one of the first central contracts four years ago, has been released by Lancashire. \"We feel it is an appropriate stage in his career for him to seek pastures new and secure more regular first-team cricket,\" said the county's manager Mike Watkinson. </p> <p>Schofield, 25, made 68 first-class appearances for Lancashire and won two Test caps in six years. But he played only three times for his county last season, and took one wicket in 27 overs, though he scored three half-centuries, which in addition to his fielding ability made him a one-day regular. </p> <p>\"The past three years have been a bit disappointing and a bit frustrating,\" Schofield said. \"If I had got a one-year contract off Lancs I would have signed it because I'm a home lad, but I think they're going to sign [Muttiah] Muralitharan next year so I'd probably be getting only one or two games of cricket. So maybe this is for the best.\" </p> <p>Sussex, whose coach Peter Moores worked closely with Schofield on an England A tour of the West Indies in 2000-01, are expected to lead the chase. Lancashire have also released Jamie Haynes, the long-serving deputy to their wicketkeeper Warren Hegg, who has signed a new one-year contract but is still considering his position as captain. </p> <p>Sussex have allowed the Pakistan pace bowler Mohammad Akram to leave halfway through his two-year contract, for personal reasons. The 30-year-old is expected to move to Gloucestershire. </p> <p>A decision on shifting the International Cricket Council's headquarters from Lord's to Dubai will be made soon, it was revealed yesterday. \"We have had a very good offer from Dubai, but we are waiting for a final proposal from the British government which will come in the next few days,\" said Ehsan Mani, the ICC's president. \"We have been based at Lord's since 1909 and it's only right that we don't get up and leave a country that has hosted us for 95 years without giving it an opportunity to come forward with a proposal.\" </p> <p>The ICC's global cricket academy will be located in Dubai Sports City. Facilities unveiled yesterday include a 30,000-capacity stadium, three other cricket grounds, indoor training and fitness facilities and an educational block. The project will be open in 2007. </p> <p>Ranbir Mahendra was voted in as president of the Indian board yesterday after an acrimonious election. Mahendra, a former secretary of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, and the politician Sharad Pawar were level before the outgoing president Jagmohan Dalmiya used his casting vote. </p> <p>However, Dalmiya is still expected to retain control after he was named as the board's first patron-in-chief earlier this month.</p>"
