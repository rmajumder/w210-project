  "<p>Lists exert a strange pull. We all think it is absurd when polls are produced saying that Ulysses is the greatest novel or Sgt Pepper the greatest album, but we find ourselves reading them all the same. So it is with league tables of economic performance.</p> <p>It doesn't really matter a fig where Britain ranks in the competitiveness rankings produced by the World Economic Forum, but we still want to know.</p> <p>Just for the record (and because you're almost certainly curious), Britain moved up four places this year to 11th. Had it not been for our poor infrastructure and inadequately educated workforce, we might even had made it to the top ten, where the Nordic countries dominated the top of the table, filling four of the top six places.</p> <p>Leaving to one side the somewhat spurious nature of comparing inter-country competitiveness, the points made by the WEF about the UK are reasonable enough.</p> <p>As yesterday's unemployment data showed, Britain has a strong record for creating jobs and its economic stability means it is a good place to do business.</p> <p>But beneath the surface of the economy lurk all sorts of weaknesses, from the slow take-up in IT to the woeful state of the railways.</p> <p>But while we've still got a long way to go to catch up with the Scandinavians - no sign there that tax and spend policies are a barrier to growth - we can at least celebrate that we've overtaken the Germans this year (13th) and have left the French (27th) for dead.</p> <p><strong>Buy George</strong><br> </p> <p>There was a moment of excitement on Tuesday week as a formal stock market announcement popped out on Matalan.</p> <p>The family-controlled chain of discount fashion sheds is repeatedly touted as a takeover target for Wal-Mart. In recent months the shares have had more spikes than a Jimmy Choo warehouse as dealers bet repeatedly on the boys from Bentonville striding into Skelmersdale and banging their cash on the counter.</p> <p>But the moment of excitement was just that: a sharp intake of breath and then a long, dull sigh. The announcement, it turned out, was news of an approach received for Matalan's Lee Cooper brand of jeans.</p> <p>The label was acquired three years ago for \u00a345m and is now a loss-making brand which might fetch \u00a325m.</p> <p>This little deal, however, won't stop the speculation about the imminent arrival of the Wal-Martians.</p> <p>The thesis is that WalMart wants Matalan as a showcase for its George fashions. But, sadly, the thesis has more holes than one of George's crocheted ponchos.</p> <p>Asda has no need to buy a chain of out-of-town stores for its popular clothing ranges. It is trialling George on the high street, because that is still where most fashion is bought. Indeed 70% of fashion purchases are still made in town centres and that is the location that Asda chief executive Tony De Nunzio has targeted for future growth.</p> <p>He is also believed to be looking to the high street to expand the group's supermarket business. Asda is effectively prevented from expanding out of town by competition rules, so it is quietly piloting stores of just 15,000sq ft on high streets like Barking in London. If it works there will be more.</p> <p>Forget Matalan. The smart punters should be targeting the high street - a medium sized chain, maybe, for just George. Or perhaps something a little larger, with outlets that could accommodate these foodhalls - and additional space for George.</p> <p><strong>Bach to front</strong><br> </p> <p>Willie (Lord) Bach, the defence procurement minister, flew to Washington last night to lobby Pentagon chiefs and senior Bush administration officials in favour of AugustaWestland as the supplier of the new fleet of helicopters to ferry Mr Bush (or Kerry) from the White House to Camp David and beyond.</p> <p>It's an 11th-hour dash along a path beaten often in the past few months by Tony Blair, trying to persuade the US to buy an Anglo-Italian helicopter for its commander-in-chief rather than an American Sikorski.</p> <p>Bach, we're told, has been promised a firm decision after the elections on November 2, certainly before January's inauguration of the new president.</p> <p>But, in beating the drum for British industry and Westland, now wholly-owned by Italy's Finmeccanica, he may find it a hard sell for an administration bent on pursuing to the hilt Boeing's case against \"illegal subsidies\" for Airbus.</p> <p>Harry Stonecipher, Boeing's boss, has been whispering loud into Bush's ear that the Europeans are mighty keen on pumping state aid into Airbus to knock its US rival out of the skies, but utterly frugal on spending money on their own defence - while encouraging their arms contractors to prise open the lucrative US military market.</p> <p>Also, Bush's team will certainly tell Bach that the UK seems strangely reluctant to cough up the \u00a31bn for new Lynx helicopters for the RAF - built by Westland at Yeovil - though a decision is likely on that too before the new year.</p> <p>We can only wish Willie an interesting 36 hours in the federal capital. But he shouldn't expect a red carpet.</p>",
  "<p>Around the time of the Democratic convention in Boston, the first such event to accredit bloggers, there was a great deal of introspective posting on what the new breed of fearless internet warriors would be doing differently from the other 15,000 media people there. One view was nothing much - bloggers being intrinsically parasitic to the big newspapers and TV stations, filtering and analysing the latest stories instead of generating them. As Wonkette emailed to <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,64273,00.html\">Wired magazine</a>: \"Reporting is something you have to leave your laptop to do.\"</p> <p>But one thing bloggers can do differently, if not better, than their mainstream rivals is organisation. You saw it in the Howard Dean campaign when a web momentum built up behind an outside candidate; in the latest attempt, pro-Kerry bloggers are mobilising against a conservative-leaning US television station that plans to show a documentary attacking the senator in the last 10 days of the campaign.</p> <p>The effort is based around the <a href=\"http://www.boycottsbg.com/\">Boycott Sinclair Broadcast Group</a> website. It charges that <a href=\"http://www.stolenhonor.com/\">Stolen Honor</a>, a film linking Mr Kerry's campaign against the Vietnam war to the torture of captured US soliders, is more \"partisan propaganda\" than documentary. Readers are asked to persuade advertisers to withdraw their spending from the group and its regional affiliates.</p> <p>It has scored some successes. A <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/story/2004/10/12/121355/52#235#235\">thread</a> at Daily Kos lists the most recent and one firm, Carroll's Furniture of Arden Hills, Minnesota, gets some applause. \"If I lived in Minnesota I'd be a customer for life,\" writes one organiser.</p> <p>The Democratic party is pursuing Sinclair through the courts for flouting federal election guidelines but one thing bloggers want to know is where the mainstream media are in all of this. Dave Pell at <strong>Electablog</strong> cannot quite believe it. \"It's these same media organisations who have allowed themselves to be slapped around enough by the phoney charges of liberal bias that they've become unable to perform their duty as a check on the balance of power in this country,\" he <a href=\"http://www.electablog.com/2004/10/time-for-big-media-to-join-fight.html\">writes</a>.</p> <p>\"The airing of a partisan hack job on Sinclair's stations will not only mark a sick victory for rabid right wingers. It will also plunge another dagger into the heart of a mainstream press seemingly unable or unwilling to defend itself.\"</p> <p>The pro-Bush <strong>Little Green Footballs</strong> is less than amused but spies an opportunity in the advertisers' database. \"[We] may be able to discover ways to contact these advertisers ourselves, and let them know that we want them to support Sinclair's constitutionally protected right to free speech,\" it suggests. A little closer to newsblog's own heart, LGF has a similar plan for the Guardian's <a href=\"http://guardian.assets.digivault.co.uk/clark_county/\">letter writing campaign</a> to the undecided voters of Clark County, Ohio. \"Make sure to go to the Guardian site and sign up for one of the addresses of the voters. That way it will be removed from being given to the wacko libs,\" reads the first <a href=\"http://littlegreenfootballs.com/weblog/?entry=13128_Guardian_Tries_to_Influence_US_Election#comments\">first comment</a>. \"Then, if you are so moved, write a letter to the person urging them to vote for President Bush. We can turn this against the Guardian and the unscrupulous liberals.\"</p> <p>Unscrupulous or not, weblogs are sure to use these next six weeks to see how much power they really have.</p>",

  "Tony Blair today went on the offensive over Iraq, accusing the Conservatives of failing to back British troops and playing \"party politics\" over the war - while rebutting claims he had misrepresented intelligence in the run-up to the invasion. <p>In a highly charged prime minister's question time - the first since the party conference season - the Tory leader, Michael Howard, repeatedly demanded an apology from Mr Blair for allegedly exaggerating intelligence evidence on Iraqi weapons of mass destruction (WMD).</p> <p>Though the prime minister apologised for the fact that information presented \"in good faith\" had subsequently turned out to be wrong, he told the Commons: \"What I don't in any way accept is that there was any deception of anyone.\"</p> <p>And, clearly riled by the refusal of the issue to die down, he turned his fire personally on Mr Howard, telling MPs: \"It would be more helpful if you would back our troops out in Iraq, rather than doing what you are doing now.</p> <p>\"I wish you would stop playing politics with this issue, which is precisely what you are doing, and remember that you and your party supported the war for precisely the same reasons that we did.\"</p> <p>In a line which appears to echo some of US president George Bush's attacks on the Democratic contender John Kerry - he declared: \"You have had four positions on the war. That is three too many for anyone who seriously aspires to be prime minister.\" </p> <p>Mr Howard, who used the first half of his questions to attack Mr Blair on Iraq, responded angrily; \"We back our troops wholeheartedly. I didn't ask you to apologise for the war because I support it. I didn't ask you either to apologise for what you describe as the information. </p> <p>\"I asked you very specifically about the way you misrepresented the intelligence you received to the country. Why can't you bring yourself now to say sorry for that?\"</p> <p>Mr Blair continued: \"I will not apologise for removing Saddam Hussein. I will not apologise for the conflict. I believe it was right then, is right now and is essential for the wider security of that region and the world. </p> <p>As the heated exchange continued, Mr Howard replied: \"But will you realise that before you can move on, there is one matter that you must deal with. You didn't accurately report the intelligence you received to the country. Will you now say sorry for that?\" </p> <p>Mr Blair replied: \"I have made it abundantly clear, and do so again ... that I take full responsibility and indeed apologise for any information given in good faith that has subsequently turned out to be wrong. </p> <p> \"That is entirely proper. I have already done so. </p> <p>\"What I don't in any way accept is that there was any deception of anyone. That is what has been looked into by four separate independent inquiries and in each case that allegation has been found to be wrong.\" </p> <p>Mr Blair agreed that some, though not all, of the intelligence subsequently turned out to be wrong. But he told Mr Howard: \"That is a very different matter from deceiving this house, I hope you will withdraw that allegation.\" </p> <p>Mr Blair's comments come after the Liberal Democrats called on him to make a full statement to the Commons and the campaign to impeach him announcing that it will be preparing its case over the next fortnight.</p> <p>Following yesterday's admission by the foreign secretary, Jack Straw, that MI6 had withdrawn the pivotal 45-minute claim on Iraqi weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and the findings of the Iraq Survey Group last week that there were none in Iraq, Mr Blair endured a stormy session of prime minister's questions.</p> <p>He was also challenged by one of his own backbenchers, Robert Wareing MP, who reminded the prime minister that he had told the Commons that Saddam Hussein could stay in power if he gave up his WMD - distasteful as his regime was. </p> <p>Mr Blair denied that this contradicted his stated aim of the invasion - Saddam's failure to comply with UN resolutions.</p> <p>Today Charles Kennedy demanded that the prime minister answer questions from MPs on Iraq now that parliament was back in session after the conference recess - a wish that was not granted by the prime minister.</p> <p>Lord Falconer today became the second cabinet minister today to use the word \"sorry\" in relation to Iraq - following Patricia Hewitt's example last week. He said: \"We know the intelligence on which it was based is flawed and we are sorry about that.</p> <p>He said Mr Blair had already expressed his regrets for the intelligence failings in his speech to the Labour conference in Brighton.</p> <p>Lord Falconer told Today: \"He has made it absolutely clear that he is sorry about the sorts of issue - the information issue, the 45-minute issue - he is very sorry about that. That's absolutely clear, that is what the position is.\"</p> <p>The cross-party campaign to impeach Mr Blair, led by Plaid Cymru and the Scottish National party, today announced it would begin drafting articles of impeachment over the next fortnight. The Tory MP Douglas Hogg QC will formulate the document.</p> <p>The campaign, which has the support of several backbench anti-war Tories, as well as Jenny Tonge from the Lib Dems, argues that Mr Blair made a secret agreement with the US president, George Bush, in 2002 to support an invasion of Iraq no matter what, thus opening up the prime minister to charges of conspiring with a foreign government.</p>",
  "President Bush's special envoy, James Baker, who has been trying to persuade the world to forgive Iraq's crushing debts, is simultaneously working for a commercial concern that is trying to recover money from Iraq, according to confidential documents. <p>Mr Baker's Carlyle Group is in a consortium secretly proposing to try to collect $27bn (\u00a315bn) on behalf of Kuwait, one of Iraq's biggest creditors, by using high-level political influence. It claims Mr Baker will not benefit personally, but the consortium could make millions in fees, retainers and commission as a result. </p> <p>Other countries, including Britain, have been urged by Mr Baker to relieve the new Iraq regime of its $200bn debt burden. Iraq owes Britain approximately $1bn. </p> <p>One international lawyer described the consortium's scheme as \"influence peddling of the crassest kind\". </p> <p>Jerome Levinson, an expert on political and corporate ethics at American University in Washington, told the Guardian: \"The consortium is saying to the Kuwaiti government, 'Through us you have the only chance to realize a substantial part of the debt. Why? Because of who we are and who we know'.\" </p> <p>When George Bush appointed Mr Baker, a former secretary of state, as his unpaid envoy on December 5 2003, he called Mr Baker's job \"a noble mission\". But Mr Baker is also a senior counsellor and an equity partner with a reported $180m stake in the merchant bank and defence contractor the Carlyle Group. </p> <p>A confidential 65-page Proposal to Assist the Government of Kuwait in Protecting and Realising Claims Against Iraq was sent in January from the consortium to Kuwait's foreign ministry, according to documents obtained by the Nation magazine in New York, which are published today on the Guardian website. </p> <p>In a letter dated August 6 2004, the consortium informs Kuwait's foreign ministry that the country's unpaid debts from Iraq \"are in imminent jeopardy\". </p> <p>World opinion is turning in favor of debt forgiveness, another letter warns, as evidenced by \"President Bush's appointment of former secretary of state James Baker as his envoy to negotiate Iraqi debt relief.\" </p> <p>The consortium's proposal spells out the threat: not only is Kuwait unlikely to see any of its $30bn from Iraq in sovereign debt, but the $27bn in war reparations that Iraq owes to Kuwait from Saddam Hussein's 1990 invasion \"may well be a casualty of this US [debt relief] effort\". </p> <p>In the face of this threat, the consortium offers its services. Its roster of former high-level US and European politicians have \"personal rapport with the stakeholders in the anticipated negotiations\" and are able to \"reach key decision-makers in the UN and in key capitals\". </p> <p>Kathleen Clark, a law professor at Washington University and a leading expert on government ethics and regulations, said this meant that Mr Baker was in a \"classic conflict of interest\". </p> <p>\"Baker is on two sides of this transaction: he is supposed to be representing the interests of the US, but he is also a senior counsellor at Carlyle, and Carlyle wants to get paid to help Kuwait recover its debts from Iraq.\" </p> <p>She added: \"Carlyle and the other companies are exploiting Baker's current position to try to land a deal with Kuwait that would undermine the interests of the US government.\" </p> <p>Last night, a Carlyle spokesman said the company had scaled down its involvement after the Baker appointment: \"Neither the Carlyle Group nor James Baker wrote, edited or authorised this proposal to the Kuwait government. When James Baker was named special envoy, which was before the proposal was produced and sent, Carlyle explicitly restricted its role to only investing assets on behalf of Kuwait, an activity that James Baker would play no role in nor benefit from.\" </p> <p>According to the documents, Carlyle is seeking to secure as part of the deal an extraordinary $1bn investment from the Kuwaiti government. </p> <p>The main proposal would transfer ownership of $57bn in unpaid Iraqi debts. The debts would be assigned to a foundation created and controlled by a consortium in which the key players are the Carlyle Group, the Albright Group (headed by another former secretary of state, Madeleine Albright) and several other well-connected firms. </p> <p>Under the deal, Kuwait would also give the consortium $2bn to invest in a private equity fund devised by the consortium, with half of that going to Carlyle. </p> <p>The consortium would then use its personal connections to persuade world leaders that Iraq must \"maximize\" its repa ration payments to Kuwait. The more the consortium gets Iraq to pay over a period, the more Kuwait collects, with the consortium taking a 5% commission or more. </p> <p>The goal of maximizing Iraq's debt payments directly contradicts the stated US foreign policy aim of drastically reducing Iraq's debt burden. </p> <p>Chris Ullman, Carlyle's spokesman in Washington, said that the firm was aware that a $1bn investment for Carlyle was part of the Kuwait proposal: \"We were aware of that. But we played no role in procuring that investment.\" </p> <p>\"So you were willing to take the billion but not to try to get it?\" He answered: \"Correct\" </p> <p>Mr Ullman said Mr Baker would not benefit from the proposed $1bn investment. \"We have controls in place that regulate how partners are compensated, we have a huge back office. We have the mechanisms.\" </p> <p>Asked whether the White House had been informed that the Carlyle consortium had been in negotiation with the government of Kuwait over debts at the time of the Baker appointment, he said: \"I'll get back to you on that.\" </p> <p>In the confidential documents, the consortium appears acutely aware of the sensitivity of Mr Baker's position as both Carlyle partner and also debt envoy for the US government. </p> <p>Immediately after listing all of the powerful players associated with Carlyle - including former President George Bush, former prime minister John Major and Mr Baker himself, the document states: \"The extent to which these individuals can play an instrumental role in fashioning strategies is now more limited due to the recent appointment of Secretary Baker as the president's envoy on international debt, and the need to avoid an apparent conflict of interest.\" </p> <p>Yet it goes on to state that this will soon change. </p> <p>\"We believe that with Secretary Baker's retirement from his temporary position [as debt envoy], Carlyle and those leading individuals associated with Carlyle will then once again be free to play a more decisive role.\" </p> <p>It was on January 21 2004, that Mr Baker's dual lives converged. That morning Mr Baker flew to Kuwait as Mr Bush's debt envoy. He met Kuwait's prime minister, its foreign minister and several other top officials with the stated goal of asking them to forgive Iraq's debts. </p> <p>Mr Baker's colleagues in the consortium chose that same day to hand-deliver their full proposal to the foreign minister, Mohammad Sabah al-Salem al-Sabah, the same man Mr Baker was meeting. </p> <p>A covering letter was signed by Ms Albright; David Huebner, chairman of the Coudert Brothers law firm (another consortium member); and Shahameen Sheikh, chair and CEO of International Strategy Group, a company created by the consortium for the purposes of this deal. </p> <p>Shahameen Sheikh, who made the delivery, said it was a coincidence. \"It had nothing to do with Mr Baker's visit ... I was in the region so I thought I would stop over on the way to Europe and deliver the proposal.\" </p> <p>The proposal \"takes into account the new dynamics that have developed in the region,\" states the Albright letter - dynamics that include \"Secretary Baker's negotiations\" on debt relief. </p> <p>If Kuwait accepts the consortium's offer, it states, \"we will distinguish Kuwait's claims - legally and morally - from the sovereign debt for which the United States is now seeking forgiveness.\" </p> <p>Iraq is the most heavily indebted country in the world. \"This debt endangers Iraq's long-term prospects for political health and economic prosperity,\" President Bush said when he appointed Mr Baker last December. </p> <p>At the time, critics expressed concern about whether Mr Baker was an appropriate choice. But the White House brushed them off. Mr Bush assured reporters: \"Jim Baker is a man of high integrity. We're fortunate he decided to take time out of what is an active life to step forward and serve America.\" </p> <p>Mr Ullman said at the time Mr Baker's post \"will have no impact on Carlyle whatsoever.\" </p> <p>The day before Mr Baker's appointment was announced, John Harris, managing director of the Carlyle Group, signed a statement to Alberto Gonzales, counsel to the president. It stated that Carlyle \"does not engage in lobbying or consulting\" and that \"Carlyle does not have any investment in Iraqi public or private debt.\" </p> <p>According to the documents, at the time of that statement the Carlyle consortium was at least five months into its assignment from the Kuwaiti government to \"prepare a detailed financial proposal for the protection and monetization\" of reparation debts from Iraq. </p> <p>The assignment was agreed at a high-level meeting with Kuwaiti officials in London on July 16 2003, according to the files the Guardian has obtained. </p> <p>Ms Clark said both criminal and regulatory statutes prohibited government officials from participating in government business in which they have a financial interest, including matters that affect an outside company that employs the official. </p> <p>In the statement to Judge Gonzales, Mr Harris wrote that \"Secretary Baker has renounced his partnership share of future benefits, if any, that might constitute a conflict with his official duties and he will not benefit personally through his Carlyle partnership income from his work as a special government employee.\" </p> <p>But the proposed deal with Kuwait is so large that it is hard to see how Mr Baker could be prevented from benefiting: Carlyle stands to land a $1bn investment, which is 10% of the firm's total equity funds. </p> <p>And under the proposal, the firm would be benefiting from that investment for at least 12 years. </p> <p>Ms Clark said: \"Even if Baker is somehow being screened from profiting from this deal, Carlyle is using Baker's government position to benefit themselves.\" </p> <p>She said it was time for the White House to come clean. \"There is a tremendous need for transparency here.\" </p> <p>According to Mr Levinson, \"What they are proposing is to completely undercut Baker's mission - and they are using their connection with Baker to Ahmed al-Fahad, under secretary to the prime minister of Kuwait, said this week: \"I have seen it [the proposal] and I am fully aware of the situation.\" </p> <p>But asked about Mr Baker's dual role, he said: \"It's hard to comment on that issue, especially now. I hope you fully understand.\" </p> <p><b>Copyright Naomi Klein.

  "Today is the first head-to-head clash between Tony Blair and Michael Howard since their party conference speeches, with Iraq back on the agenda in the wake of last week's Iraq Survey Group reporting no WMD in the country, and yesterday's admission from the foreign secretary that MI6 had privately withdrawn the pivotal 45-minute claim. <p>Charles Kennedy has already called on Mr Blair to make a full statement following PMQs - a call which appears to have gone unheeded. But for Mr Howard, whose party supported the war, the political geography is more complex. Party strategists in Bournemouth claimed Iraq was only 12th on most voters' list of concerns.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Mr Blair is unlikely to expand on his \"I can apologise\" formulation on intelligence failures over Iraq made at his Brighton conference speech, while seeking to push the domestic agenda - such as today's good news on hospital A&amp;E waiting times. </p> <p><b>Midday</b><br> Sir Teddy Taylor is first - but Mr Blair begins by sending condolences to the families of Ken Bigley and two dead British soldiers.</p> <p>Sir Teddy asks if it is still government policy to seek euro entry, when would the referendum take place, and how long would a no vote govern the government.</p> <p>Mr Blair jokes that Sir Teddy used to be a \"lonely\" Tory in calling for EU withdrawal, but was now in the \"maintream\" of his party - \"rubbish\", jeer the Tory benches.</p> <p>Dover MP Gwyn Prosser bemoans the huge job losses announced by P&amp;O last week. \"We stand ready to make sure we'll give help to anyone made redundant,\" promises Mr Blair. </p> <p>Michael Howard's turn. \"I supported the war. It was the right thing to do. Will the prime minister realise before he moves on, there is one thing he must do: say sorry for misrepresenting the intelligence.\"</p> <p>\"I apologise for any information given in good faith that turned out to be wrong. Indeed, I have already done so,\" says Mr Blair, before saying four independent inquiries have vindicated him. \"He should stop playing politics on this issue and back our troops out in Iraq,\" he concludes.</p> <p>\"I didn't ask him to apologise for the war,\" points out Mr Howard, before adding that the Tories do back British troops. \"Why can't he bring himself to say sorry for misrepresenting the intelligence?\"</p> <p>\"I cannot say sorry because I do not believe I did,\" counters the prime minister, before bringing in yesterday's release of correspondence with Hans Blix which the British government released appearing to show the then chief UN weapons inspector thought the government's dossier could even \"underplay\" Saddam Hussein's capabilities.</p> <p>Mr Howard is not to be put off. He repeats that Mr Blair told parliament the intelligence was \"beyond doubt\" when in fact it was qualified. </p> <p>\"He maintained the desire but may not have had stockpiles,\" says Mr Blair, but goes on to say that \"everybody knows what [Michael Howard] is trying to do - capitalise on anti-war sentiment\".</p> <p>The prime minister concludes that Mr Howard has had four separate positions on the war - \"three too many for anyone who has serious aspirations to become prime minister.\"</p> <p>Anti-war Labour MP Jeremy Corbyn asks why Mr Blix wasn't given more time to conduct weapons inspections in Iraq. Mr Blair says the ISG found Saddam was in breach of UN resolutions, \"and that was the reason for going to war\".</p> <p><b>12.10pm</b><br> Mr Kennedy rises to ask why Sir David Manning, Mr Blair's foreign policy advisor, had told the Americans the prime minister \"would not budge\" from backing President Bush's desire for regime change.</p> <p>Mr Blair says the context of the memo was trying the UN route of backing resolutions rather than US regime change. </p> <p>\"Regime change is contrary to international law - where does that leave his war? He lead us into an illegal war,\" charges Mr Kennedy. </p> <p>The prime minister says we went to war because post-September 11 we could not allow a nation to remain in breach of UN resolutions on chemical and biological weapons. He asks if Mr Kennedy accepts the ISG report in full - before accusing him of only accepting conclusions he agreed with.</p> <p>\"Without our intervention Saddam and his sons would still be running Iraq and I stand by the decision I made,\" finishes Mr Blair.</p> <p><b>12.15pm</b><br> A question on internet safeguards defuses the atmosphere - briefly.</p> <p>Lib Dem Tom Brake reminds Mr Blair of his promise to resume attention on the Israel/Palestine problems \"in November\" - does the prime minister believe the people involved can wait that long, he asks?</p> <p>\"I will make it my personal priority but the reality is it's only after the election in the next few weeks we can make progress,\" says Mr Blair. </p> <p>Labour's Kelvin Hopkins says Spain's socialist government has had to bring back in-house privatised hospitals - will the prime minister thus abandon plans for foundation hopsitals?</p> <p>Mr Howard is back. Will Mr Blair join \"the consensus\" on pensions argued for by most pensioner groups, he asks.</p> <p>The prime minister reels of a list of Labour improvements and concessions for pensioners, but will not follow the new Tory policy of restoring the link between pensions and average earnings - a way of escaping means-testing, according to Mr Howard. </p> <p><b>12.20pm</b><br> \"It's time to stop talking and start taking action,\" says Mr Howard, echoing his party conference slogan. He says Adair Turner, the author of the recent pensions report, agrees with the Tories that means-testing discourages saving. </p> <p>The Conservatives did act in office, replies Mr Blair. They broke the link with earnings, and introduced VAT on fuel, and one in four pensioners lived in poverty. \"Forgive me if I ignore what he says based on 10 years as a cabinet minister in that government!\" </p> <p>Mr Howard responds by quoting Labour's Frank Field as saying that since 1997 Britain has gone from having one of the best pension provisions in Europe to one of the worst. </p> <p><b>12.25pm</b><br> Labour's Robert Wareing returns to the war, pointing out that Mr Blair has claimed that without the war Saddam and his sons would still be in power, while quoting the prime minister back at himself as saying: \"I detest his regime but even now he could save it by complying with UN demands.\"</p> <p>This produces great cheers and groans around the house - a dramatic moment - but Mr Blair says it complies exactly with his argument that the casus belli was Saddam's refusal to follow UN resolutions.</p> <p>The Speaker tells Plaid Cymru's Adam Price - who wants Mr Blair to be impeached - to \"calm down or leave the chamber.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile Mr Blair, getting angry, quotes today's find of a mass grave in Iraq to show why such a regime should not have been allowed to gain WMD.</p> <p>The Tory Andrew Turner asks why \"nuclear sites in Iraq have now been looted\"? Mr Blair denies there wasn't a proper plan for post-Iraq reconstruction.</p> <p>Milton Keynes MP Phyllis Starkey quotes a local Tory in her constituency saying his party has suffered \"a collective failure of nerve\" over Europe. To Mr Blair's relief he can merely say this particular Tory is speaking \"a great deal of sense\".</p> <p>Iain Duncan Smith rises from the backbenches in PMQs - for the first time since he left the Tory leadership - to say that vulnerable should not be starved to death if they can't help themselves, as one provision of the mental incapacity bill may mean, and that MPs should have a free vote on the issue. </p> <p>Mr Blair says he will look at it closely, but the relevant minister disagrees with that interpretation of the bill. </p> <p>And that's the end of a fractious session.</p>",

  "It's just possible that you have heard this once or twice before recently, but the forthcoming American election, on November 2, may be the most important in living memory. People have been saying this about every presidential race for decades - but, as one environmentalist put it recently in a US newspaper interview, precisely the problem with crying wolf is that sometimes there is a wolf. You would be forgiven, though, for feeling increasingly helpless as you hear the \"most important election\" mantra repeated daily: unless you happen to be a voter in a handful of swing states, there's little you can do about the final result. If you're not American, the situation is more acute. Certainly, the actions of the US impact on our lives in overwhelming ways; British political life may now be at least as heavily influenced by White House policy as by the choices of UK voters. And yet, though the US Declaration of Independence speaks of \"a decent respect to the opinions of mankind\", you don't, of course, have a vote. You can't even donate money to the campaigns: foreign contributions are outlawed. And you're unlikely to have the chance to do any campaigning on the ground. All you can do is wait and watch: you're powerless. <p>Or are you? At G2, that sounded like fighting talk. Where others might see delusions of grandeur, we saw an opportunity for public service - and so, on the following pages, we have assembled a handy set of tools that non-Americans can use to have a real chance of influencing the outcome of the vote. We've identified ways to give money to help your preferred candidate, even though direct campaign contributions from foreigners aren't allowed. There are ideas for making your voice heard in the influential local media outlets where it could really count. And at the core of it is a unique scheme to match individual Guardian readers to individual American voters, giving you the opportunity to write a personal letter, citizen to citizen, explaining why this election matters to you, and which issues you think ought to matter to the US electorate. It may even be a chance to persuade somebody to use their vote at all. </p> <p>To maximise the likelihood of your efforts making a difference, we've zeroed in on one of the places where this year's election truly will be decided: Clark County, Ohio, which is balanced on a razor's edge between Republicans and Democrats. In the 2000 election, Al Gore won Clark County by 1% - equivalent to 324 votes - but George Bush won the state as a whole by just four percentage points. This time round, Ohio is one of the most crucial swing states: Kerry and Bush have been campaigning there tire lessly - they've visited Clark County itself - and the most recent Ohio poll shows, once again, a 1% difference between the two of them. The voters we will target in our letter-writing initiative are all Clark County residents, and they are all registered independents, which somewhat increases the chances of their being persuadable. </p> <p>Several of the ideas described here can easily be applied across the US too, though, and we have provided further resources on our website for this purpose. While there's no point being coy about Britain's preferences in this election (never mind those of Guardain readers) - a poll last month put backing for Kerry at 47%, against 16% for Bush - we have included information for supporters of both main candidates. </p> <p>It's worth considering at the outset how counterproductive this might all be, especially if approached undiplomatically. Anybody might be justifiably angered by the idea of a foreigner trying to interfere in their democratic process. But this year the issue is more charged than ever: the Bush/Cheney campaign has made a point of portraying Kerry as overly concerned about what other nations think, and the Democrat's ambiguous debate point about American foreign policy decisions needing to pass a \"global test\" has become one of the president's key lines of attack. \"People don't necessarily want to hear what people from other countries have to say,\" says Rachelle Valladares, the London-based chair of Democrats Abroad. \"If you contact someone you know personally in the States, and urge them to vote, it would probably carry twice the weight.\" Michael Dorf, a Columbia university law professor who has studied foreign influences on US elections, points out that it would not be to either candidate's advantage \"to be seen as the candidate of the foreigners. Part of it's just xenophobia, but there is also a sense that, you know, this is our election: you vote for your parliament and prime minister, we vote for our president and Congress.\" </p> <p>On the other hand, being from Britain ought to give you a certain leverage: in stump speeches and debates, Bush has repeatedly praised Tony Blair's cooperation over Iraq, making America's long-treasured alliance with the UK key to the president's defence of his foreign policy. Kerry, too, knows that he's speaking to a resilient strand of opinion when he emphasises the need for strong international alliances: a better coalition in Iraq, he constantly reiterates, might have saved US lives. (One recent poll suggested that 43% of Americans think that declining world respect for their nation is a \"major problem\".) As a British citizen, you can certainly wield some influence, but you could seriously alienate people too. </p> <p><b> Write to a voter</b><br> </p> <p>The most powerful transatlantic connection is a personal one, so we have designed a system to match individual Guardian readers with individual voters in Clark County, in the crucial swing state of Ohio. To join in, visit <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/clarkcounty\">www.theguardian.com/clarkcounty</a> and enter your email address. You'll receive, by email, the name and postal address of a Clark County voter. We have included only those voters who chose to list themselves as unaffiliated, instead of as Republican or Democrat: that is no guarantee that they are persuadable, of course, but it does increase the chances. The data on which our system is based is publicly available, but we have designed it to give out each address only once, so there is no danger of recipients getting deluged. </p> <p>In formulating your letter, you will need to introduce yourself: no individual Clark County voter will have any reason to be expecting your communication. And in choosing your arguments, keep in mind the real risk of alienating your reader by coming across as interfering or offensive. You might want to handwrite your letter, for additional impact, and we strongly recommend including your own name and address - it lends far more credibility to your views, and you might get a reply. </p> <p>Finally, post your letter soon. Letters sent by regular airmail from the UK to the US usually take five days to reach their recipient, and there is little time to waste. Postage costs 43p for a postcard, 47p for a letter weighing 10g or less, and 68p for a letter weighing up to 20g. You don't have to visit a post office, but Royal Mail recommends writing \"Par Avion - By Airmail\" on the front of the envelope, and your return address on the back. </p> <p><b> Give money</b><br> </p> <p>American law forbids foreigners from giving money to affect the outcome of a federal election - except that, on closer inspection, it doesn't. You're banned from donating to the campaigns themselves, or to many of the independent campaigning groups that fight explicitly on behalf of one candidate. So you need to identify officially non-partisan groups whose activities, none the less, have the practical effect of helping one candidate over the other. \"Perhaps the most important way foreigners could help John Kerry would be to help out those organisations which have, as part of their mission, fostering African-American voter turnout,\" says Nathaniel Persily, a Pennsylvania university expert on election law. \"It's quite clear that if there was 100% African-American turnout in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida, John Kerry would win this election running away.\" The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People is the most obvious choice here - an influential, well-organised, non-partisan body whose get-out-the-vote activities are extremely likely to end up helping the Democrats. </p> <p>\"On the Republican side, it would be the Christian conservatives,\" Persily adds. \"[Bush adviser] Karl Rove has tried to register four million additional Christian evangelicals, and if they all turn out, then Bush wins.\" The leading option here would be the Christian Coalition, which describes itself as \"America's leading grassroots organisation defending our Godly heritage\". As for more overtly partisan organisations, we don't recommend trying to donate - but it's worth pointing out that much of the law banning foreign contributions has never been tested in court and, argues Michael Dorf at Columbia, may even be unconstitutional on grounds of free speech. \"If a group calling itself Europeans for Truth wants to run ads giving their view of the truth,\" Dorf says, \"it's hard to draw a principled distinction between that and a British newspaper available at a US newsstand that has an editorial calling Bush and Blair liars.\" </p> <p><b>Visit the NAACP website:</b> <a href=\"http://www.naacp.org\">http://www.naacp.org</a> <br> <b>Give to the NAACP:</b> <a href=\"https://www.naacp.org/contribute.php\">https://www.naacp.org/contribute.php</a> or fax a credit-card donation to 001 410 580 5623.<br> <b>Give to the NAACP in Ohio:</b><br> Send a money order marked \"donation\" to NAACP, 233 South High Street, Columbus, Ohio 43215 USA.

Take care: deluging the same organisation with numerous near-identical messages rarely impresses (we speak from experience), and some activists have run into controversy recently by disseminating \"astroturf\" - letters purporting to be personal but emanating, in reality, from party headquarters.

Among yesterday's topics: why John Kerry doesn't understand the significance of 9/11; why John Kerry would be dangerous for America; how John Kerry politicised the death of Christopher Reeve. </p> <p>Air America, the upstart liberal radio counterweight, is still in its infancy, but it can be picked up in parts of Ohio and other battleground states.

  "More than 60 million viewers saw the first presidential debate; the second also drew a mammoth audience, up 50% on the debates of 2000. But this election's most intense political communication has bypassed the vast majority of the American public. <p>The Bush and Kerry campaigns, together with their surrogates, have aired more than 600,000 TV ads since the end of primary season in March. But most of those have been aimed at a narrow slice of America, in swing states. As we enter the final phase of this presidential race that slice is getting narrower, though the money spent on advertising keeps soaring.</p> <p>When the dust settles on November 3 about $1bn (\u00a30.6bn) will have been spent on campaign ads, making this election easily the most expensive in history - yet over 60% of all Americans will not have seen a single political commercial.</p> <p>Eight of the top 10 cities where the most advertising dollars are being spent are in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida. Topping the list is Cleveland, Ohio. Christmas has come early for local TV stations in the capital of America's industrial rust belt. </p> <p>Philadelphia, in Pennsylvania, ranks second: $25m will be spent in this city, two hours away from New York. So while New Yorkers have been spared the advertising avalanche, the good burghers of Pennsylvania and South Jersey have been bombarded with the candidates' messages for months.</p> <p>In third place is Miami, Florida, as balanced on a knife edge today as it was four years ago. To gauge how this election is playing out you need to keep up with the campaign ads running in these three battleground states. </p> <p>Bush is running three new ads in tight rotation. The most commonly repeated of these attempts to condemn Kerry as the poster child of tax-and-spend liberalism. The narrator intones: \"John Kerry and the liberals in Congress's record on the economy: higher taxes 350 times ... an average of once every three weeks for 20 years ... like clockwork.\" </p> <p>This ad is the reason John Kerry kept warning viewers in the second debate not to pay heed to the labels Bush is trying to stick on him: his warning was not aimed at the debate viewers so much as at the few thousand people who could tip the election in those key swing states, who have been inundated with Bush advertising.</p> <p>The most recent ad, released after the second debate, attempts to win back ground Bush has lost to Kerry on Iraq. Kerry has successfully killed the \"flip-flop\" argument against him and turned the attention on to Bush's record. </p> <p>The Bush advert tries to paint Kerry as soft on terrorism. \"Kerry said defeating terrorism was really more about law enforcement and intelligence than a strong military operation,\" declares the voiceover, using Kerry's comments from the second debate against him. \"How can Kerry protect us when he doesn't understand the threat?\"</p> <p>Bush is again trying to pin a \"shopsoiled liberal\" label on Kerry. The ad lacks power, however, because viewers immediately connect the phrase \"strong military operation\" with Iraq and the negative images of mayhem they see on the TV news. </p> <p>The third ad in heavy circulation tries to tarnish Kerry with the \"trial lawyer\" reputation of his running mate, John Edwards, arguing that the healthcare crisis is a result of nuisance lawsuits. This advert is the weakest of the three because most people rightly lay the blame of their sky-high premiums at the door of the healthcare management companies, part of the big-business monolith they feel gets deferential treatment from the current administration. </p> <p>The fundamental problem with these Bush ads is that they try to attach current problems to a hypothetical future performance. Kerry's 20-year record in the Senate only gives the president so much ammunition; once we get to the last four years, Bush has to take responsibility for his own record - and he is on shaky ground. However much he would like to blame Kerry for it, it's a tough, if not impossible, sell.</p> <p>Kerry's latest ads work better because they focus on the president's actual performance, or lack of it, in three key areas: homeland security, jobs and social issues.</p> <p>The newest clearly points out what has not happened in George Bush's war on terror. It states that 95% of all containers coming into America go uninspected, and that this president would prefer to protect his tax cut for the rich before the nation's security. </p> <p>The president's dismal economic performance provides the fuel for another ad. \"Only Herbert Hoover had a worse record on jobs,\" concludes the announcer. The bald, irrefutable fact of the first net decrease in jobs in 70 years speaks for itself.</p> <p>A third ad draws on the star power of the extremely popular and Parkinson's-afflicted Michael J Fox. Talking straight to camera, Fox questions Bush's decision - informed by the religious right - to limit stem cell research. \"George Bush says we can wait,\" states Fox calmly. \"I say lives are at stake and it's time for leadership.\"</p> <p>While the final presidential debate is likely to draw a huge TV audience, it will not be these voters who decide the outcome: that honour will fall to a bleary-eyed, ad-addled few. The rest of us can only hope they get it right.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> James is a former senior Democratic party strategist</p>",
  "<p>Gordon Brown yesterday underlined his determination to play a key role in Labour's general election strategy by making clear he will be responsible for much of the manifesto on which the party will fight for a third term. </p> <p>The chancellor peppered a speech in the north-east, where he was campaigning for a Yes vote in the forthcoming devolution referendum, with his election priorities - principally measures to narrow regional divisions by improving education and encouraging enterprise. </p> <p>Backed by the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, who is the architect of plans for an elected north-east assembly, Mr Brown made it clear that he would not be sidelined by the party's newly installed election coordinator, Alan Milburn, MP for Darlington. </p> <p>A week before 1.9 million electors in the north-east receive voting papers for the all-postal referendum on November 4, the chancellor told the business community in Newcastle upon Tyne that an assembly was essential to counter the dominance of the south-east. </p> <p>Amid a sea of Labour posters and leaflets lamenting the economic weakness of the north-east and the growing strength of London, Mr Brown maintained that regional inequalities were not inevitable. </p> <p>But he cautioned: \"Balanced economic growth becomes impossible if we have unemployment and emigration and the under-use of resources in one part of the country and congestion and overcrowding and huge inflationary pressures in the other.\" </p> <p>With jobless rates in the north-east almost twice those in the south-east, he maintained that an elected assembly would help to re-balance England. </p> <p>\"There is nothing inevitable about regional inequalities,\" he said. \"The north-south divide is not and should never be treated as a permanent feature of the British economy.\" </p> <p>Mr Brown, who has forged a strong alliance with the deputy prime minister to push for greater decentralisation to the English regions - particularly in the north - used his speech to highlight the need for far-reaching reforms in the workplace and in the school. </p> <p>But, time and again, he referred to the forthcoming election campaign. \"The theme of this referendum and the coming general election manifesto will be the economic reforms we've got to make, region by region, to become more competitive, productive, prosperous, wealthy, as a nation,\" he said, in the first of a string of references to a \"third term manifesto\". </p> <p>Later, visiting the Millennium Bridge, which links the Newcastle-Gateshead waterfronts, the chancellor was asked whether he would be writing the manifesto. \"I am doing the economic brief and I'll be having the pre-budget report and the budget, and that will, of course, influence the manifesto,\" he replied cautiously. </p> <p>Earlier, addressing the businesspeople, John Prescott joked that he was the chancellor's \"agent\", before pleading with his audience not to draw any \"misinterpretation\" from a throwaway line. \"I'm back on the campaign trail,\" he enthused. </p> <p>\"It's about the north leading the way. You have been demanding to have more 'say' about things ... a chance to make your own decisions instead of them being made by quangoes and all sorts of government departments.\" </p> <p>Mr Brown said he had been a supporter of north-east devolution since the early 1980s, when he first met Mr Prescott - then opposition regions spokesman. </p> <p>But opinion surveys show many voters have still to make up their minds, with one today in a local newspaper giving the No campaign the advantage. </p> <p>Campaign posters underline the nervousness of devolution supporters, with some proclaiming: \"This is our chance - let's not waste it.\" </p> <p>While some were impressed by Mr Brown's performance at yesterday's events, several key businesspeople claimed the chancellor and deputy prime minister had grossly overplayed the influence of a north-east assembly. </p> <p>One said the package on offer was \"barely worth having\" because Whitehall would control so many strings.</p>",
  "<p>Four of the biggest American public pension funds said yesterday they would press for shareholders to have the right to nominate directors to Walt Disney's board. </p> <p>The funds, including the California Public Employees' Retirement System, or Calpers, and the New York State Common Retirement Fund, plan to vote for shareholders to be able to nominate up to two directors at Disney's 2005 annual meeting. </p> <p>Disney's chief executive, Michael Eisner, who intends to step down in 2006, gave up his role as chairman this year after holders of 45% of Disney shares withheld votes for his re-election to the board amid campaigns from large funds and former directors Roy Disney and Stanley Gold. </p> <p>The ability for shareholders to nominate directors is a contentious issue, backed by corporate governance reformers and largely opposed by American corporate executives. </p> <p>The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Pension Funds, or AFSCME, and the Illinois State Board of Investment also backed the latest proposal, which was filed with the US securities and exchange commission. </p> <p>\"We have agreed to co-sponsor this resolution to use in the event the Disney board doesn't satisfy our concerns about independent directors,\" Calpers president Sean Harrigan said in a joint statement from the funds. </p> <p>If the group, which owns less than 1% of Disney shares, wins enough votes for the proposal in 2005, shareholders could be allowed to nominate directors in 2006, according to the statement. </p> <p>Disney currently has 11 board members but its bylaws set the board size at nine to 21, according to the statement.</p>",
  "Between Oil City, Pennsylvania and Canton, Ohio, a hilly, leafy terrain gives way to a landscape as flat and appealing as warm Pepsi. Arriving in Canton on Interstate 77 you pass a Hoover plant, which has laid off more than 800 workers in the past seven months, and then a huge religious billboard asking: \"Saved?\" and offering a number to call. <p>Between them they represent the two countervailing trends that are shaping the election here - the decline in heavy industry and the rise of holy doctrine. </p> <p>Ohio is not just a swing state for this election; it is a bellwether state accustomed to picking the winner in almost every election. No Republican has ever won the White House without taking it; Democrats have only done so twice. </p> <p>And if Ohio is a marker of the national mood, Stark County (population 377,519), in which Canton is the main town, is the best indicator of what Ohio is thinking, backing the right candidate for president every election bar one over the past 40 years. </p> <p>As Ohio goes, so goes the nation; as Stark County goes, so goes Ohio. </p> <p>Stark County came by its status honestly. Its 576 square miles span cornfields, steel plants, suburbs and slums. </p> <p>It couldn't be anywhere in America - its plains are too plain to be anywhere other than the Midwest - but with the exception of Latinos it has a proportionate piece of everything and everybody. </p> <p>\"We have this reputation by virtue of the accident that all the major demographic groups are represented here,\" says John Green, director of the University of Akron's Bliss Institute for Applied Politics. \"It's a microcosm of the state.\" </p> <p>Of the many stops that Bush has made to Ohio since he was elected, one stands out. In April last year he visited a research facility for the steel and bearings factory Timken, in Canton. </p> <p>Alongside him stood \"Tim\" Timken who earned a seat on the Ohio delegation at the Republican convention this year by raising more than $200,000 (around \u00a3110,000) for Bush. </p> <p>\"The greatest strength of the American economy is found right here, right in this room,\" said Mr Bush. </p> <p>\"I know you're optimistic about the future of this company, and I'm optimistic about the future of our country.\" </p> <p>Almost exactly a year later Timken announced plans to close down three of its bearings factories, putting 1,300 people out of work. In a county where unemployment stands at 10% and a city that has lost 3,700 jobs since Mr Bush came to office, the news hits hard. </p> <p>A woman walking out of Stark County's job centre, The Employment Source, stops me without introduction. </p> <p>\"I don't know about you but the world seems to bite you in the ass an awful lot nowadays,\" she says. </p> <p>Inside several people have been bitten hard and keep on trying to bite back. </p> <p>Gail Wilson worked in human resources until she was \"job eliminated\" in June 2002. Since then she has been taking temporary work whenever she can get it and learning new computer skills while her two sons tide her over. </p> <p>\"I've lowered the bar over the years,\" she says. \"My last job I earned more than $20 an hour, but I'm looking at $10 an hour now because I need the work. I never would have supported Bush but now I'm telling everyone I know they've got to go for Kerry.\" </p> <p>As well as hardening up soft voters, Mr Kerry may also be buoyed by the swell of new voters on the rolls. </p> <p>Democratic areas of Ohio, where registration ended last week, have seen a 250% rise in new voters, compared with a 25% growth in Republican areas. In Stark county, where Bush won by 3%, there has been a relatively modest but nonetheless significant 6% increase in new voters. </p> <p>Yet Mr Bush still holds a narrow lead in Stark County, pipping Kerry by 46% to 44% with 9% still undecided in a poll released last week by the local newspaper The Repository. </p> <p>\"I'm going to vote for Bush,\" says a Timkens worker coming off the afternoon shift who refused to be named. </p> <p>\"He's screwing us with jobs, but I'm against abortion and Bush has stepped up over the war and I don't think Kerry would have. I can get another job. But you can't get another set of principles or another country if we get attacked again.\" </p> <p>Chris Paxos, 26, who recently lost his job as a salesman for a small building maintenance company, adds: \"I'm going to vote for Bush because he believes if you make money you get to keep it. And he's for gun rights.\" </p> <p>Does Mr Paxos have a gun? \"No, but my parents do. I grew up around guns and I think you should be able to keep them.\" </p> <p>\"You'd think people would worry more about the issues that affect their daily lives,\" says Stan Jasionowski, president of United Steelworkers of America union Local 1123, which represents the bearings workers at Timken. </p> <p>\"But people keep bringing up abortion, gun control and gay rights.\" </p> <p>On polling day there will also be a referendum on the ballot to ban gay marriage, a ploy to mobilise the republican base. </p> <p>\"The economy is an important issue,\" says Mr Green. \"But more people have concerns premised on other things like foreign policy matters or social issues. The new voters could make a difference, but nobody knows who they are and just because they are registered doesn't mean they will vote.\" </p> <p>Down at 540 Eagle, one of the two gay bars in town, Bob Blackburn has just come off his shift in the steel mill, where he drives a forklift truck. He's backing Kerry but the Republican emphasis on gay marriage doesn't surprise him. \"If they don't have somebody to beat up on they're in trouble. They need an enemy and they've decided to make us the enemy,\" he says. </p> <p>When people lose their job in America, more often than not, it is not just injurious to their bank balance but to their health. With no national health service, most people's health insurance is tied to their job. \"For small problems I can go to the free clinic,\" says Ms Wilson. \"But if I got a catastrophic illness I would be up a creek without a paddle.\" </p> <p>\"It just takes a little crisis and you're finished,\" says Donna Berkebile, program director of the Stark County Hunger Task Force, which has seen a 25% increase in people using its services over the past few years. </p> <p>\"Your child gets sick, you take them to the doctor and there goes the food money.\" </p> <p>Joan Iarussi has faced some major crises in the past few years, but she's nowhere near finished. On June 8 she went in to Hoover one morning, as she had done for 17 years, to be told her job as a software engineer had been \"terminated\". </p> <p>Two years earlier her 52-year-old husband, who was a skilled steel worker, took early retirement as his company sought redundancies. After his company went under he found his pension was worth 20% of what he had been promised, after the government refused to underwrite it. </p> <p>Still unable to find a job, Ms Iarussi is re-training; Mr Iarussi is cutting grass at the Hoover High School for less than a third of what he earned a few years ago. \"It was like a death,\" she says, referring to the loss of her job. \"It's my job to fix it and I'm looking for a plan.\" </p> <p>She doesn't yet know how she is going to vote: Mr Kerry seems too wishy-washy, while Mr Bush too stubborn. </p> <p>\"I want to know that they have a plan in the same way I have a plan.\" she says. \"And I have to believe that their plan will work. I want my situation to improve with their plan and I want the world to improve with their plan. My little picture of the American dream is fading pretty fast.\" </p> <p>As often happens with those who make up their mind late, if Ms Iarussi does not hear what she wants by polling day she will vote against the incumbent. \"I think we have given Bush a chance,\" she says. \"I have had to reinvent myself to look for a new job. He could too.\" </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Next stop, Dearborn, Michigan</p>",
  "<b> John Le Carr\u00e9</b> <br> Maybe there's one good reason - just one - for re-electing George W Bush, and that's to force him to live with the consequences of his appalling actions, and answer for his own lies, rather than wish the job on a Democrat who will then get blamed for his predecessor's follies. <p>Probably no American president in all history has been so universally hated abroad as George W Bush: for his bullying unilateralism, his dismissal of international treaties, his reckless indifference to the aspirations of other nations and cultures, his contempt for institutions of world government, and above all for misusing the cause of anti-terrorism in order to unleash an illegal war - and now anarchy - upon a country that like too many others around the world was suffering under a hideous dictatorship, but had no hand in 9/11, no weapons of mass destruction, and no record of terrorism except as an ally of the US in a dirty war against Iran. </p> <p>Is your president a great war leader because he allowed himself to be manipulated by a handful of deluded ideologues? Is Tony Blair a great war leader because he committed Britain's troops, foreign policy and domestic security to the same hare-brained adventure? </p> <p>You are voting in November. We will vote next year. Yet the outcome in both countries will in large part depend on the same question: how long can the lies last now that the truth has finally been told? The Iraq war was planned long before 9/11. Osama provided the excuse. Iraq paid the price. American kids paid the price. British kids paid the price. Our politicians lied to us. </p> <p>While Bush was waging his father's war at your expense, he was also ruining your country. He made your rich richer and your poor and unemployed more numerous. He robbed your war veterans of their due and reduced your children's access to education. And he deprived more Americans than ever before of healthcare. Now he's busy cooking the books, burying deficits and calling in contingency funds to fight a war that his advisers promised him he could light and put out like a candle. </p> <p>Meanwhile, your Patriot Act has swept aside constitutional and civil liberties which took brave Americans 200 years to secure, and were once the envy of a world that now looks on in horror, not just at Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib, but at what you are doing to yourselves. </p> <p>But please don't feel isolated from the Europe you twice saved. Give us back the America we loved, and your friends will be waiting for you. And here in Britain, for as long as we have Tony Blair singing the same lies as George Bush, your nightmares will be ours. </p> <p>\u00a9 David Cornwell 2004<br> <b>\u00b7</b> John Le Carr\u00e9 is a novelist.</p> <p><b> Antonia Fraser</b><br> O duty </p> <p>Why hast thou not the visage of a sweetie or a cutie ... ? </p> <p>Why art thou so different from Venus? </p> <p>And why do thou and I have so few interests in common between us? </p> <p>These sentiments on the subject of duty, so brilliantly expressed by Ogden Nash, may well be yours, dear Unknown, when I, a national of another country, urge you to do your duty and vote in your coming presidential election. In fact, of course, we have all too many interests in common. When you vote - and please do vote by the way, even if you disagree with everything I am about to say - that vote will have as much effect on my future and the much longer future of my children and grandchildren, as it will on your own. For this is a crucial election, the most crucial, I believe, of my lifetime (and I first voted in 1955!). </p> <p>First of all, if you back Kerry, you will be voting against a savage militaristic foreign policy of pre-emptive killing which has stained the great name of the US so hideously in recent times. A policy that Bush and his gang are set to continue - if they get the opportunity. I say \"the great name\" of the US because I believe that to be profoundly true. Although resolutely against the Iraq war, I remain equally resolutely philamerican, almost every movement towards liberty in the past having its roots or its refuge in the US. </p> <p>As a wartime child, I am well aware of the benevolence of the American soldiers who came to our aid, the ones that filled the foreign graveyards where they lay, fallen because they had joined our war. Brought up in Oxford, I regarded these men as gods, generous gods. I shall never forget Hank, a composite of the very young American soldiers who regularly got my brother Thomas and me into the Ritz cinema to see movies such as Saboteur. In fact, Hank, in retrospect, looked rather like the Great Tom, my cinematic hero in Saving Private Ryan (so maybe Tom is Hank's boy; I like to think so). From the image of Hank to that of Abu Ghraib ... </p> <p>Then there is the question of women's rights, and the possible repeal of legislation that has for a generation made all women equal before the law, not just the rich. Once again, this history of women's rights in America is long, strong and wonderful. As long ago as 1835, Alexis de Tocqueville, visiting America from France, discovered \"the singular address and happy boldness\" of its women, featured in Democracy in America. If you vote for Kerry, you will help to avert a move backwards towards women's suffering. </p> <p>President Bush declared on Friday that, \"History will decide\". Dear Unknown, please be part of that history and restore your country to its greatness, both foreign and domestic. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Antonia Fraser is a biographer and historian. </p> <p> </p> <p><b> Richard Dawkins</b><br> Dear Americans, </p> <p>Don't be so ashamed of your president: the majority of you didn't vote for him. If Bush is finally elected properly, that will be the time for Americans travelling abroad to simulate a Canadian accent. Please don't let it come to that. Vote against Bin Laden's dream candidate. Vote to send Bush packing. </p> <p>Before 9/11 gave him his big break - the neo-cons' Pearl Harbor - Bush was written off as an amiable idiot, certain to serve only one term. An idiot he may be, but he is also sly, mendacious and vindictive; and the thuggish ideologues who surround him are dangerous. 9/11 gave America a free gift of goodwill, and it poured in from all around the world. Bush took it as a free gift to the warmongers of his party, a licence to attack an irrelevant country which, however nasty its dictator, had no connection with 9/11. The consequence is that all the worldwide goodwill has vanished. Bush's America is on the way to becoming a pariah state. And Bush's Iraq has become a beacon for terrorists. </p> <p>In the service of his long-planned war (with its catastrophically unplanned aftermath), Bush not only lied about Iraq being the \"enemy\" who had attacked the twin towers. With the connivance of the toadying Tony Blair and the spineless Colin Powell, he lied to Congress and the world about weapons of mass destruction. He is now brazenly lying to the American electorate about how \"well\" things are going under the puppet government. By comparison with this cynical mendacity, the worst that can be said about John Kerry is that he sometimes changes his mind. Well, wouldn't you change your mind if you discovered that the major premise on which you had been persuaded to vote for war was a big fat lie? </p> <p>Now that all other justifications for the war are known to be lies, the warmongers are thrown back on one, endlessly repeated: the world is a better place without Saddam. No doubt it is. But that's the Tony Martin school of foreign policy [Martin was a householder who shot dead a burglar who had broken into his house in 1999]. It's not how civilised countries, who follow the rule of law, behave. The world would be a better place without George Bush, but that doesn't justify an assassination attempt. The proper way to get rid of that smirking gunslinger is to vote him out. </p> <p>As the bumper stickers put it, \"Re-defeat Bush\". But, this time, do it so overwhelmingly that neither his brother's friends in Florida nor his father's friends on the Supreme Court will be able to rig the count. Decent Americans - there are absolutely more intelligent, educated, civilised, cultivated, compassionate people in America than in any other country in the western world - please show your electoral muscle this time around. We in the rest of the world, who sadly cannot vote in the one election that really affects our future, are depending on you.

  "Even Ohio's proudest natives concede that it doesn't have the rough-hewn glamour of Texas, or the evocative pull of states such as Louisiana or Mississippi; it isn't particularly central to US history, like Massachusetts, or even notably eccentric, like Utah. It is flat. It is temperate: it is the heartland. <p>\"It's a balanced place,\" Herb Asher, an Ohio State University political scientist, says simply. As a result, Clark County, the focus of the Guardian's election project, offers about as representative a cross-section of American life outside the big cities as it is possible to find in such a kaleidoscopic nation. </p> <p>The area's vital statistics underline that: in 2003, the population of 143,351 had a median income of $40,340 (\u00a322,500) - just a sliver below the US average. Eighty-eight per cent of them were white, compared to 77% nationally. </p> <p>With an Air National Guard base in Springfield, the county's major town, and the Wright-Patterson air force base, one of the nation's most important, not far away, there is a strong military influence; that will account for much Republican support, and has kept Iraq at the centre of local pre-election debate. But the soldiers and their families are balanced by the blue-collar workforce at Navistar, Springfield's biggest local employer, which makes agricultural equipment. (Clark County's famous sons may include James Thurber, and president William H Taft, but it was another local boy, William Whitely, who made the biggest difference, by inventing the first combined self-raking reaper and mower.) Navistar has been forced to lay off hundreds of workers over the past four years; economic issues, Asher says, will be crucially important in swaying undecided voters. </p> <p>When they're not working, plenty of Springfielders are watching football - the Ohio Buckeyes football team absorbs much of the state's attention, while closer to home, the focus is the longstanding crosstown sporting battle between the town's North High School and South High School. As across the midwest, antique buying and selling is also massively popular; Springfield is home to three of the region's largest antique malls. The Springfield Museum of Art is one of Ohio's finest; the picturesque campus of Wittenberg University is home to 2,000 students. </p> <p>\"We do have our social problems,\" says Tracy Figley, the general manager of WEEC Christian Radio in Springfield, and a 17-year veteran of the area. \"I can't compare it to bigger cities, because I've never lived in bigger cities, but we do have gangs, we do have drug problems. I'm not sure you're even safe in what you'd traditionally call the good side of town: it depends on what mischief is lurking in the hearts of people.\" </p> <p>Gay marriage has become a central issue for the town's sizeable evangelical community, Figley argues: he says he knows many who would have voted for Kerry despite differences on abortion but who plan to vote for Bush because of the candidates' differing positions on same-sex unions. But the key national issues of Iraq and the economy will still dominate the closing weeks of the election race.</p>",
  "More than 650 foreign affairs experts, including prominent US and UK figures, have signed an open letter condemning the Bush administration's policies in Iraq, accusing it of harming the struggle against terrorism. <p>\"We judge that the current American policy centred around the war in Iraq is the most misguided one since the Vietnam period,\" the experts, who called themselves Security Scholars for a Sensible Foreign Policy, wrote in a letter released last night. </p> <p>They include former staff of the White House, the state department and the Pentagon, along with six of the past seven presidents of the American Political Science Association, and academics from the London School of Economics and Oxford, Bradford, Glasgow, Wales, Lancaster and London universities. </p> <p>\"You have folks who are conservative, folks who take very different approaches to understanding world politics,\" said Stuart Kaufman, the University of Delaware professor who organised the letter. </p> <p>\"Not only is it a substantial fraction of the entire field, but it reflects the entire spectrum of intellectual opinion, all agreeing on this when they agree on barely anything else.\" </p> <p>The experts applaud the decision to invade Afghanistan, but accuse the White House of \"a great blunder\" in failing to commit sufficient troops, then fighting a war in Iraq with inadequate justification, troops or postwar planning. </p> <p>\"Policy errors during the occupation and reconstruction of Iraq have created a situation in Iraq worse than it needed to be,\" they write, criticising \"an emphasis on speculation instead of facts, on mythology instead of calculation, and on misplaced moralising over considerations of national interest\". </p> <p>They add: \"The results of this policy have been overwhelmingly negative for US interests.\" </p> <p>Last night the White House said nobody was available for comment.</p>",

  "<p>It was the glamorous American hotelier and tax dodger Leona Helmsley who once noted that only \"the little people\" paid taxes. I wonder if Helmsley has ever met BBC1 controller Lorraine Heggessey? Last weekend, Heggessey discussed the future of comedian Graham Norton on the channel she runs. She announced that Norton, on a reported \u00a32m pay packet, will soon host Strictly Dance Fever, a cross between Pop Idol and Come Dancing. And she mused blithely: \"It's going to take time, but one of the things I can afford to do as a public service broadcaster is to nurture talent.\" </p> <p>High-spending Heggessey makes Norton sound like a Pontin's bluecoat plucked from obscurity. He's been hugely successful on Channel 4 for years. (Previously he worked in the Eagle pub near the Guardian's London office, where, had the BBC noticed him a decade ago, it might fairly now claim to be \"nurturing talent\".) </p> <p>There are some 25 million \"little people\" paying the \u00a3121-a-year poll tax that is the licence fee. Might they reasonably ask why the BBC recruited Norton earlier this year - waving a cheque representing the licence fees of an entire provincial town - if it had no idea exactly what he was going to do or how quickly he might succeed? </p> <p>The BBC will retort that big-money transfers are commonplace in broadcasting. But they hardly ever work. In 1999, ITV poached Ross Kemp from the BBC with a multi-million-pound offer similar to Norton's. The barrel-chested hunk - Kemp, not Norton - has starred in a string of leaden-footed dramas ever since. As a soldier, then a policeman, he seems to be working his way through the dramatis personae of the Village People. But if ITV casts him as a Red Indian next, it's throwing away shareholders' money, not the general public's. </p> <p>Heggessey, appointed in 2000, may well make high-minded reference to public-service broadcasting. She also often talks of the need for the BBC to deliver big audiences in order to justify the licence fee. Like so many of her colleagues, she knows the BBC faces the renewal of its charter in 2006. The \u00a32.8bn coughed up annually by licence payers, on pain of imprisonment for non-payment, is up for grabs. </p> <p>But what has actually happened to the distinctive popular programmes on BBC1 that once served as a shared watercooler experience for the nation? For more than a decade, EastEnders was a BBC flagship, with almost 15 million viewers. The soap sometimes stood accused of being misery-laden, but was almost always dramatic and moral. Every evil had consequences. As one of its stars, Pam St Clement, told the Observer in October 2001: \"You always see the results of actions on other people.\" </p> <p>Nowadays, EastEnders looks as though it has been sterilised for American network transmission. In spite of former director-general Greg Dyke's complaint that the BBC was \"hideously white\", not a single authentic Asian plotline remains. An occasional gay is allowed on screen - as long as there's no touching - in regressive contrast to the series' courageous 1980s heyday. Comedy characters are introduced, but no one troubles to give them comedy lines. </p> <p>Last week, EastEnders featured an incomprehensible scene in which actor Shane Ritchie appeared to bang his head against the wall. With audiences tumbling, the remaining viewers could presumably understand just how he felt. </p> <p>BBC bosses, with one eye on charter renewal, have promised time and again in the past two years that derivative and makeover programmes will be sidelined. Let's assume generously that Norton's new \"cross\" between Pop Idol and Come Dancing is not derivative of either. </p> <p>But tonight's prime-time BBC1 schedule alone features an hour of Bargain Hunt, Ground Force and the National Lottery. That's followed by 60 minutes of What Not to Wear, in which \"Trinny and Susannah turn their attention to badly dressed mothers with teenage daughters\". </p> <p>Just like a Holloway inmate who finds religion shortly before a parole hearing, the BBC has recently presented us with a spate of programmes on general knowledge, healthy eating and the restoration of old buildings. But for every piece of public-spirited philanthropy, there's an accompanying piece of unalloyed dross. </p> <p>One career that Heggessey has rescued is that of Jim Davidson, who is now furnished with regular slots on BBC1. BBC nabobs may find Davidson funny. No doubt he is, as far as bigoted boozers go. But his alienating, bullying humour is hardly a public service. </p> <p>In the newly published My Trade - a title suggesting Freddie Mercury's autobiography, but sweetly chosen instead by Andrew Marr - the BBC's political editor notes: \"We need [a] culture of public broadcasting to keep the rest honest.\" In his days as Channel 4 chief executive a decade ago, the BBC's new chairman Michael Grade made exactly the same point. </p> <p>You only have to look at Channel 4, where for much of the summer Big Brother has become the main act rather than a diverting sideshow, to see that both men are completely right. A BBC1 awash with Trinny, Susannah and Jim Davidson lets everyone else off the quality hook. </p> <p>One thing that BBC TV still does brilliantly, incidentally, is publicity. We may now await the solemn letter - with baffling references to audience share, reach and the important distinction between peak and prime time - assuring us that there never was a halcyon past. It will point out (as it almost always does) that, 30 years ago, a staple of the BBC1 schedule was the now unacceptable Black and White Minstrel Show. </p> <p>But 30 years ago, there was nowhere else to turn except ITV. Today we live in a digital world of almost 200 TV channels. </p> <p>Shrewd politicians know that if taxpayers are to continue unconditionally funding the NHS, most people must think it is good most of the time. If the public is to continue paying the licence fee uncomplainingly after 2006, we \"little people\" need to think the same about that other shared national treasure, the BBC. </p> <p> <strong> Bush fouls up all by himself</strong></p> <p>John Kerry's campaign dismisses suggestions that George Bush was \"wired up\" for prompting during his first presidential debate. \"If he was, he wouldn't have been that bad,\" sniffs a Kerry aide. </p> <p>Perhaps Eton should deploy the same defence against claims that Prince Harry was \"helped\" with his A-level coursework by teachers. The poor thing scraped a D and a B to secure a place at Sandhurst. </p> <p>But why on earth would Harry need to cheat anyway? His Uncle Edward, who later rose to become teaboy to Andrew Lloyd Webber, won a place at Jesus College, Cambridge in 1983 with a paltry C and two Ds. Prince Philip's relieved response at the time? \"What a friend we have in Jesus.\"</p>",
  "<p>The death of Christopher Reeve on Sunday, nine years after a horse riding accident left him paralysed from the neck down, was mourned by papers on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday. The actor, best known for playing Superman, died before fulfilling his wish of being able to walk again. </p> <p>\"On screen he was superhuman,\" said Jeremy Laurance in the <strong> Independent </strong>, \"but it was off-screen, arguably, where he displayed his real strength.\" Reeve \"devoted his life, and a considerable part of his fortune, to trying to repair his body and campaigning for more research into spinal-cord injury\", Laurance continued. \"He was the ambassador every charity dreams of finding.\" </p> <p>In an age when debates about medical research are so often dominated by political wrangling, it was \"refreshing\" to hear \"the authentic voice of a patient like Reeve\", wrote Colin Blakemore, the head of the British Medical Research Council, in the <strong>Daily Mail</strong>. </p> <p>The actor was \"a beacon of optimism\", added the <strong>Times</strong>, but was \"criticised by some for encouraging expectation beyond science's ability to deliver\". Still, his memory \"forces US politicians of all stripes to find enough common ground on stem cell research\", said the paper. </p> <p>The medical use of stem cells is a \"hot topic\" in the US presidential campaign, observed the <strong>New York Post</strong>. George Bush \"initiated federal funding of research on stem cells, but with substantial limits, which John Kerry promises to lift\". But Reeve's memory \"will be done a disservice if it is exploited for partisan gain\", it argued. </p> <p>The <strong>Los Angeles Times</strong> was among those in the US to highlight the wider import of Reeve's campaigns. It noted that the actor used his fame \"to push for better insurance cover for those unable to pay for nurses, aides and top doctors like the ones he had\". It was just a shame, added the <strong>Philadelphia Inquirer</strong>, that it seemed to require the voice of \"some stricken celebrity\" to \"put a medical condition on the map\". </p> <p>\"Reeve made me uncomfortable\", admitted the <strong>Washington Post</strong>'s Richard Cohen. \"There was no way to see him and not remember what he had been. The tendency is to want to turn away. But Reeve would not permit that... He insisted that we face reality, even if he really could not.\"</p>"
