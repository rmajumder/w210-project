  "His glory days are behind him. At 75, he is frail, his hands shaky, his lapels covered with a score of badges from organisations as diverse as Peace Now and the Samaritans. <p>Yasser Arafat was once a regular visitor at the White House: the Palestinians say he saw Bill Clinton when he was president 28 times. But George Bush refuses to have him in Washington and he is no longer welcome in Downing Street. </p> <p>Visits from the world's leaders are diminishing. The last delegation to the presidential compound in Ramallah was from Luxembourg. </p> <p>He remains a virtual prisoner of the Israelis, unwilling to take a chance by leaving his compound, where he has spent the past 41 months. The reasons are piling up: the fear of assassination, capture or exile; the possibility that Israel may attack the 20 wanted Palestinians sheltering there. </p> <p>But he professes to be sanguine about his predicament. \"It makes no difference,\" he said in a three-hour discussion over dinner with British journalists this week. </p> <p>He'd had worse experiences as a fighter more than 30 years ago, he said. \"It is not my first time to face these troubles. I was obliged to stay in Mount Hermon [on the borders of Israel, Syria and Lebanon] for two years in the ice and snow with Israeli planes shelling me and many comrades being killed.\" </p> <p>His home these days is the remains of the presidential compound, partially destroyed by Israeli forces in 2002. </p> <p>The entrance is protected by oil-drums filled with concrete to slow tanks, and the doorways and halls are lined with sandbags. </p> <p>Unable to even wander round Ramallah, he tries to maintain his fitness by walking back and forward along a corridor between the two remaining buildings: the corridor was rebuilt after being demolished by the Israelis. </p> <p>His alternative fitness regime is to walk repeatedly around the table that doubles as office and dining place. His bedroom is next door. </p> <p>He eats little. From a table filled with lamb, chicken and rice, he took only broccoli, garlic and steamed corn on the cob, and a Diet Coke. </p> <p>He answered questions until midnight, at times directly addressing issues, at others distracted, wandering back to recall in detail old diplomatic triumphs and blunders, mainly the negotiations at Camp David with President Clinton more than four years ago. </p> <p>At the end of the dining table are relics of the days when peace seemed close. In the jumble of presents is a tarnished aluminium dove presented by the Peres Centre, run by the former Israeli Labour prime minister Shimon Peres, and a brass owl from the Samaritans. </p> <p>He intersperses opinions on the chances of a renewed peace process or the planned Israeli pull-out from Gaza with odd or unsubstantiated conspiracy theories. The Israelis may have known about the Taba bombings in advance but did not pass the information to the Egyptians, he claimed. </p> <p>The Iranians are interfering in South African politics and the South African president, Thabo Mbeki, had asked for his help; the Israelis had been firing depleted uranium shells at the Palestinians. </p> <p>His ministers and advisers flanking him occasionally whispered into his ear to advise moderating an opinion, to complete a sentence, or to suggest that a fact was wrong. </p> <p>Occasionally he accepted the advice, and at other times told them that their memories were faulty. He teased one of them, Jibril Rajoub, claiming he was having secret talks with the Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon's son Omri. </p> <p>He was more pessimistic than usual about the chances of ever reaching a deal with Mr Sharon that would see him released. Asked whether an agreement was possible with Mr Sharon, he said: \"It is very difficult. Maybe with [Binyamin] Netanyahu.\" </p> <p>He recalled that Mr Netanyahu, though on the right of Mr Sharon, had in the past, in spite of tough rhetoric, signed deals with the Palestinians. </p> <p>But Mr Netanyahu may not be prime minister for years to come, if at all, and there is no guarantee he would contemplate a deal with Mr Arafat. </p> <p>It is not just that the Israelis have succeeded in isolating him physically and diplomatically, even the Arab countries are no longer helping as much as they once did, tired of the corruption surrounding him or sensing that there is little prospect of a resolution to the conflict in the near future. </p> <p>With the exception of Saudi Arabia, he said, Arab countries had either stopped or reduced contributions to the Palestinian Authority, which is not sure whether it has enough to meet this month's pay bills. </p> <p>Asked whether Mr Bush or John Kerry would be more likely to find a Middle East settlement, he chewed his food and smiled: \"For me, it makes no difference.\" Both have said they will not meet him.</p>",

  "Afghanistan's election crisis seemed to be over yesterday when the main opposition challenger, Yunus Qanooni, withdrew his threat to boycott the result. <p>His decision cleared the way for the votes to be counted. An American-conducted exit poll has predicted a handsome margin of victory for the interim president, Hamid Karzai. </p> <p>Mr Qanooni plunged the election into chaos on Saturday when he led 14 other candidates in declaring the poll illegitimate because of allegations of possible fraud. </p> <p>An indelible ink system designed to prevent multiple voting proved faulty - some voters washed the ink from their hands easily - provoking the suggestion that the election would have to be held again. </p> <p>But yesterday Mr Qanooni withdrew and said he had agreed to make his complaints to an investigation by the electoral body run by the Afghan government and the UN. </p> <p>The ethnic Hazara leader Mohammed Mohaqeq and the only woman candidate, Massouda Jalal, had already backed out. Others are expected to follow suit. </p> <p>\"I don't want to be against the election and I appreciate the goodwill of the people of Afghanistan,\" Mr Qanooni said. </p> <p>His chance of being elected was low, according to the preliminary findings of the election's only exit poll, by the International Republican Institute, which predicted that Mr Karzai would win enough votes to avoid a run-off against Mr Qanooni. </p> <p>The IRI, which is linked to the Republican party, said more than 10,000 voters in 26 of Afghanistan's 38 provinces had been questioned. The poll was paid for by the US government agency USAid. </p> <p>President George Bush is keen to demonstrate that Afghanistan is a foreign policy success during next month's US election, particularly against the backdrop of Iraq. </p> <p>The defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, speaking in Macedonia, said the media had played up the negative aspects of the election.\"The fact is they just had an election. It's breathtaking!\" he said. </p> <p>Observers said the election, in which millions of Afghans ignored threats of Taliban violence to go to the polls, was imperfect because of official blunders, inexperience and some reported vote rigging. </p> <p>But in general, they said, it was an inspiring experience. \"It's easy to be cynical but I thought it was a really amazing day,\" a diplomat said. </p> <p>The IRI exit poll was condemned by some European countries, which had earlier agreed not to conduct exit polls. \"We were concerned that if you started asking Afghans who they voted for, they might lose confidence in the secrecy of the ballot,\" a diplomat said last night. </p> <p>But it may be the only indication of the result for several days. With ballot boxes being transported from remote mountainous areas by road, helicopter and mule, counting is not due to begin until tomorrow at the earliest. </p> <p>Officials said it could take up to a week to produce the first significant results, and the final tally should not be expected before October 30.</p>",
  "<p>Harry Stonecipher, Boeing's chief executive, yesterday accused European rival Airbus of undercutting the price of his company's planes through illegal government subsidy in an escalation of the growing trade war between the US and EU. </p> <p>Mr Stonecipher made plain that Boeing was not prepared to make concessions in any negotiations under the World Trade Organisation and would press for a new agreement that banned government launch aid for Airbus. Last week the US terminated a 1992 bilateral agreement on state aid for new commercial aircraft, prompting an EU counter-suit, amid allegations that both sides had provided their main plane-makers with unlawful multi-billion aid. </p> <p>Mr Stonecipher, who said he had discussed the issue with Airbus executives last month, denied that Boeing had pushed for a WTO case because Airbus was preparing a new plane, the A350, to rival Boeing's make-or-break 7E7 Dreamliner. </p> <p>\"I don't think we're under any more pressure than we have been in the past, but I don't want to start from a position of being under water due to subsidies,\" he said. \"We always expected Airbus to respond to our 7E7 and, with their financial muscle, they can fund it perfectly well by going to commercial banks, not governments.\" </p> <p>The Boeing chief also rebutted suggestions that the US was playing politics in the run-up to the November 2 presidential poll. \"We've got bipartisan support from Congress and both candidates for president. This one is not going to go away after the election - and nobody is trying to start a trade war here,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Some things are par for the course on a pre-election blog. A mocked-up photograph of John Kerry as <a href=\"http://www.blogsforbush.com/mt/archives/002378.html\">Neville Chamberlain</a> on the unaffiliated but supportive <strong>Blogs for Bush</strong> should not surprise you so much.</p> <p>Not surprise you, but it is still not at the highest level of political debate.</p> <p>Though the reasoning is simple, George Bush is a well known enthusiast for Winston Churchill, the faithful view the war on terror as a second world war re-run and Republican supporters are convinced 1930s-style appeasement was at work when Mr Kerry said Americans needed \"to get back to the place we were, where terrorists are not the focus of our lives, but they're a nuisance\". On the plus side, at least no one pasted <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/photos/politics/kerry2.asp\">Jane Fonda</a> in there this time round.</p> <p>But there are times when even the rough and tumble of electoral passions morph into something further from the truth. It is in this manner, presumably, that the same blog turns <a href=\"http://www.blogsforbush.com/mt/archives/002379.html\">abuses at the Abu Ghraib jail</a> into \"crude fraternity pranks\" and the \"anti-US organisation\" that (to its mind, surprisingly) approved of the Afghan elections was the United Nations and not the more militantly anti-American al-Qaida.</p> <p>There are bound to be a few reasons for this: one is that intense partisanship (on both sides) and stubbornness are not too far apart; another (whisper this quietly) that there is not a huge amount going on in this between-debate lull but people still need something to shout about.</p> <p>Breaking all the rules, come twinned posts on the pro-Bush <strong>Wizbang</strong> and pro-Kerry <strong>The Blogging of the President</strong> asking those straying out of their usual patch of the blogosphere why they are voting for their chosen candidate. \"Absolutely no mention of John Kerry will be tolerated,\" state the ground rules on the latter. \"This is to limit the discussion to 'why vote FOR Bush' and not 'why to vote AGAINST Kerry'. If you want to discuss that, there are a couple zillion websites out there.\"</p> <p>So far the posts have proved interesting. \"Bush is doing something we haven't done in a half a century - trying to spread a semblance of liberty to the regions of the world that sorely need it,\" posts Gary Owen on <a href=\"http://www.bopnews.com/archives/001911.html#1911\">The Blogging of the President</a>. \"Bush stands for retaining America's pre-eminence in the world, and has made great strides in eliminating state sponsorship of terrorism.\"</p> <p>\"Taxes,\" adds David B. \"Whoever lowers taxes the most and the fastest will win my vote 99% of the time. It doesn't matter to me who's taxes get lowered, just as long as government takes less and less of our money.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://wizbangblog.com/archives/003938.php\">Wizbang</a>'s posts put forward the Kerry argument, including some seldom heard: \"There needs to be a return to balance in the balance of powers,\" writes David Anderson. \"Since the GOP will probably manage to hold on to a majority in congress, it will serve the interest of the American people better to have a Democrat in the White House.\"</p> <p>Another says Mr Kerry was his anyone-but-Bush candidate until he saw a television interview. \"There it was clear that this guy's not just smart, but balanced,\" suggests Doug Robinson. \"There's a kind of middle-aged gravitas to him, not a heaviness so much as a calm self-awareness: a sense of 'I know who I am and don't have to fake it'. That's pretty rare in politics.\"</p> <p>It is not exactly Chamberlain's peace in our time or the trigger-happy Texan of legend, but it may be the best we can hope for until the final debate throws up a new set of quotes to discuss, and video freeze frames to pore over.</p>",
  "<p>Medics have a name for the devastating injury that Christopher Reeve suffered during what was supposed to be just another day's riding in May 1995. They call it the Hangman's fracture, after those best known to have exploited its swift and almost guaranteed effect. </p> <p>When Reeve fell, he landed in such a way that his neck fractured high up, between the first and second vertebrae. It is one of the body's key weak points: sever the spinal cord so high up and not only does it stop nerve signals sparking between your brain and limbs, rendering you quadriplegic, it also cuts off nerve signals to your lungs. Without immediate attention, the Hangman's fracture causes death by suffocation. </p> <p>With luck, Reeve got help immediately, and at that point began his public transformation from superhero to a man half-reclined in a motorised wheelchair. </p> <p>But there was more to Reeve's transformation than the new limitations so visibly thrust upon him. He became a vocal advocate for the cutting-edge medical science of stem cell research. In stem cells, Reeve saw a powerful tool being hampered by US policy, a tool that not only promised potential therapies to heal himself, but to treat a host of medical conditions in others. \"He wanted every effort to be made on behalf of patients of all disorders that could potentially be helped by stem cell research,\" says Roger Pederson, an acquaintance of Reeve's and professor of regenerative medicine at Cambridge University. </p> <p>And Reeve made a difference. He campaigned in Congress. He was the public figure that brought the stem cell debate to the public. \"He was the human voice that changed attitudes,\" says Colin Blakemore, chief executive of the Medical Research Council. \"It's one thing for scientists to say, 'We know we can do this', but Christopher Reeve put all this into a real-life perspective.\" </p> <p>Reeve came to the stem-cell debate when the US was considering outlawing therapeutic cloning, a technique where stem cells are harvested from surplus fertilised eggs created in fertility clinics. Such embryonic stem cells, it is thought, can be turned into any of the hundreds of cell types in the body. To its supporters, few medical technologies have held more promise, as they could potentially be used to replace damaged and diseased cells anywhere in the body. To its critics - and in Washington, that meant many Republicans and the religious right - this creation of embryos is morally repugnant. </p> <p>Reeve saw the resistance as a challenge. \"His dream was to come to the UK, be treated with a whole repertoire of stem cell therapies - that is to say, making nerves from stem cells through therapeutic cloning. He then wanted to return to the US and walk off the plane and be arrested for having infringed US laws against therapeutic cloning,\" says Pederson. </p> <p>With an eye on the electorate, the Bush administration imposed strict controls on therapeutic cloning, declaring that while private institutions could do whatever they wanted, federal funds could only be used to research stem cells created before 2001. Without the full weight of federal funding behind it, Reeve and many scientists felt stem cell research had been scuppered. He set up the Christopher Reeve Paralysis Foundation to fund some of the best research into therapies for paralysis, but research is an expensive business and the $15m (\u00a38.3m) a year the foundation dedicated to research was just a fraction the US National Institutes of Health could have paid for, if the Bush administration had allowed it. \"He was incensed by the quitter attitude of the Bush administration, which held back from exploring every possible avenue,\" says Pederson. </p> <p>Despite the restrictions in the US, which presidential candidate John Kerry has vowed to lift should the US electorate give him the chance, stem cell research continues at a fierce pace. Last year, the California-based company Geron announced they had used an injection of human embryonic stem cells to restore some function to rats who had had their spinal cords cut. The work, though promising, is still a lab study. In the real world, fractures are messy and when nerves are damaged in the spine, the injury site is quickly mobbed with cells that make nerve repair extremely difficult. </p> <p>Geron is arguably the world leader in trying to use stem cells to treat spinal cord injuries. But in other companies and universities, stem cells are being put through their paces to see if they can help treat conditions as disparate as Parkinson's, Alzheimers, diabetes and motor neurone disease. Others are using stem cells to correct irregular heart beats and salvage damaged retinas. </p> <p>In Britain, one of just a handful of countries to have firm legislation allowing therapeutic cloning to produce stem cells, only one licence has been granted for such research. Based at Newcastle University, Miodrag Stojkovich and Alison Murdoch of the Newcastle Fertility Centre hope to produce stem cells to study diabetes and Reeve's contribution to helping the public understand the merits of stem research is not lost on them. \"We will miss his contribution, especially where mediation of scientific progress to the public is needed, but we hope that we will go on where his dream stopped,\" says Stojkovich. </p> <p>Last month, Ian Wilmut, the scientist behind the team that cloned Dolly the sheep, applied for a licence to clone embryos to make stem cells, this time to treat motor neurone disease. If their application gets the green light from the Human Fertility and Embryology Authority, the body that polices such research in the UK, the team hope to begin work by Easter next year. </p> <p>If ever there were a flurry of activity in medical science, stem cells has to be it. In one week this month, two scientific teams reported successes with stem cells. In Israel, Izhak Kehat of the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology created biological pacemakers for pigs, by implanting heart cells derived from human stem cells into their hearts. If the technique works in humans, it could make electrical pacemakers obsolete. Meanwhile the Massachusetts-based Advanced Cell Technology announced they had, for the first time, transformed stem cells into retinal cells. Transplanted into the eye, the company hopes that the cells could reverse some of the most common forms of blindness. </p> <p>Within the stem cell community, arguments still rage over whether funding should be skewed in favour of more versatile embryonic stem cells or the less ethically problematic adult stem cells. These provoke less ethical backlash because they can be extracted from people who are able to give consent. Bone marrow has long been known as a rich source of adult stem cells, and they are also found at the base of hair follicles, where they help stimulate hair growth. But scientists believe adult stem cells have a downside - they cannot be transformed into any kind of cell. Their role in the body has already, at least in part, been determined. More versatile may be stem cells taken from the blood of umbilical cords, though again, these have limits on what they can turn into. </p> <p>The balance of versatility versus acceptability is very different for embryonic stem cells. While scientists believe that these cells can truly form any other type in the body, that they must be extracted from a ball of 100 or so cells grown from a fertilised egg is viewed by some as morally objectionable. </p> <p>Many who have staked their futures on finding cures with stem cells are reluctant to say when real therapies will emerge, so when Reeve announced his desire to walk again, so soon after his accident, many saw it as the most wishful of thinking. According to Pederson, though, his hopes were not misplaced. \"It's probably 10 years off and that's the tragedy, that it hasn't happened in Christopher's lifetime. Now we must redouble our efforts to make sure these advances happen in the lifetime of people who need them and can benefit from them.\"</p>",
  "<p>Forget Fahrenheit 9/11. Team America: World Police is easily the most riveting political satire of the year, if not the most entertaining, the silliest and the dirtiest.</p> <p>This unhinged parody of '80s action movies focuses on a gung-ho team of American special agents, played by marionettes, who are hell-bent on ridding the world of terrorists, even if it means toppling the Eiffel Tower and mowing down innocent civilians in the process. Featuring terrorists who mumble \"Jihad\" and \"Mohammed\" and puppets engaging in sexual positions never before seen at the Cineplex, Team America constitutes a generational litmus test like none before it. At the screening I attended, younger viewers laughed hysterically and emerged with huge grins on their faces, older viewers sat in silence and walked slowly from their seats, scowling. But your ultimate reaction to this film will no doubt depend entirely on 1) how many bad formulaic action movies you sat through in the '80s; 2) whether the word \"fuck\" makes you uncomfortable; and 3) how excited you are to see miniature replicas of self-righteous celebrities get their heads blown to smithereens.</p> <p>Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the creators of South Park, have created a visually stunning, wildly goofy but undeniably incisive critique of American culture and our role as global cops. Wall-to-wall absurdity from the first shot, it doesn't pull any punches, and even its Scooby Doo-like ending will have you laughing louder than you have at any of the limp comic offerings of the last few years.</p> <p>Unless, of course, you hate it.</p> <p>I met up with Parker and Stone in Beverly Hills, Calif., where our interview was the first in a two-day whirlwind of movie junkets for Team America. A day after Sean Penn attacked them publicly in a letter, and shortly after the movie finally received an R rating by the MPAA after making some required cuts (including, reportedly, a \"golden shower\" scene between marionettes), the two seemed slightly shellshocked, but were extremely easygoing and eager to talk about what's arguably their funniest, most ambitious work to date.</p> <p><strong>I saw Team America last night and, my God, I've never seen anything so obnoxious in my life.</strong></p> <p><strong>Parker:</strong> [Laughs] My family's in town - my aunts and uncles - and I really don't even want them to see it.</p> <p><strong>Really?</strong></p> <p><strong>Parker:</strong> Not out of embarrassment, I just know they're gonna be confused.</p> <p><strong>I've never heard more hysterical laughter at a screening before in my life, but when I was walking out I saw a few older people with extremely grim looks on their faces.</strong></p> <p><strong>Stone:</strong> Right. I don't think it's for older people.</p> <p><strong>And it's probably hard to translate it for them.</strong></p> <p><strong>Stone:</strong> I did an interview the other day with this college kid who was like, \"I think this movie will span generations! What would you say to an 85-year-old about the movie?\" I was like, \"Don't go see this movie. Because you'll be bummed out. It is not for you.\"</p> <p><strong>Are there ever people who say, \"Oh, I usually hate humor like this, but you guys do it so well.\" Or do people who hate this kind of humor just hate your stuff?</strong></p> <p><strong>Parker:</strong> Yeah, they hate our stuff. And they hate us.</p> <p><strong>Stone:</strong> They hate us. But we haven't really had that many reactions to the movie yet. It's only been shown [in screenings] for the first three or four days, so we don't really know.</p> <p><strong>Parker:</strong> We got some hatred yesterday from some of the foreign press people, who were like, \"This movie is so hateful!\" and \"How dare you?\" They basically wanted to use all their time to just try to slam us. And then I was thinking about it, and I thought, I guess if I didn't offend an uptight old German woman - I mean, if we can't offend her, we haven't done anything.</p> <p><strong>Stone:</strong> At least we offended somebody.</p> <p><strong>Still, do you ever feel like you cover your asses too much by taking on targets on opposing sides?</strong></p> <p><strong>Parker:</strong> I don't think so, because we do take somewhat of a stand at the end. I mean, I believe we do make a point at the end of the movie. Some people consider that point to be fairly right-wing, and some people consider it to be fairly left-wing ...</p> <p><strong>What do you think that point is?</strong></p> <p><strong>Parker:</strong> [Laughs] The thing is, obviously, we're not setting out to make a movie going, Look, America, this is how you should run things, this is how it should be. Because then we'd be no better than the fucking actors we hate. But the only thing that we assert is that there's a difference between dicks and assholes. That's the biggest thing that we assert.</p> <p><strong>Stone:</strong> That's such a strong political statement.</p> <p><strong>Parker:</strong> And it really kinda is! Because that's the thing that we realized when we were making the movie. It was always the hardest thing. We wanted to deal with this emotion of being hated as an American. That was the thing that was intriguing to us, and having Gary (the main character) deal with that emotion. And so, him becoming ashamed to be a part of Team America and being ashamed of himself, he comes to realize that, just as he got his brother killed by gorillas - he didn't kill his brother; he was a dick, he wasn't an asshole - so too does America have this role in the world as a dick. Cops are dicks, you fucking hate cops, but you need 'em.</p> <p><strong>Thanks to all the assholes - or criminals. Or in the case of the movie, terrorists.</strong></p> <p><strong>Parker:</strong> Right. Because there are assholes - terrorists - you gotta have dicks - people who hunt down terrorists. And I think that that is a pretty strong thing to assert, actually ... at least the pussies think so.</p> <p><strong>The pussies being the whiny liberals. But you obviously make fun of dicks - or ugly Americans - for the first half of the movie.</strong></p> <p><strong>Stone:</strong> Well, it's just Gary coming to terms with the fact that it's an imperfect world, basically. And this is Gary going, \"This is as much sense as I can make of it.\"</p> <p><strong>Parker:</strong> Dicks are bad, and it sucks to be a dick, but it's way worse to be an asshole, and because there are assholes, we need dicks. So shut the fuck up, all you pussies!</p> <p><strong>Stone:</strong> That does seem like a funny way to put it.</p> <p><strong>What question are you dreading the most?</strong></p> <p><strong>Parker:</strong> Why marionettes?</p> <p><strong>Stone:</strong> Why puppets? That's what everyone always says first thing. \"Why puppets, guys?\"</p> <p><strong>Better cross that one off the list ...</strong></p> <p><strong>Parker:</strong> Well, you always have the one question that you answer in every interview, to the point where we know that one of us is going to start the answer, and we know exactly what the other one is going to say ...</p> <p><strong>So it ends up feeling rehearsed.</strong></p> <p><strong>Parker:</strong> It's the only thing that does, because we try to stay really conversational. Because there is a fascinating story behind it, which we won't tell you now.</p> <p><strong>Stone:</strong> Since you're not going to ask that.</p> <p><strong>Parker:</strong> But because there is a specific story behind it, it gets told and retold.</p> <p><strong>OK, I shot myself in the foot. I'll just have to <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0372588/trivia\">link to the story</a>. I'm wondering, do you ever take a break and eat some lunch and come back and say, \"Man, I'm not so sure about that part that goes 'Lick my butt and suck my balls'\"?</strong></p> <p><strong>Stone:</strong> No. Those are always the parts we're most sure about.</p> <p><strong>Although I did notice that, when you do the touching ballad-reprise of [the movie's theme song] \"America! Fuck, Yeah!\" you didn't include the lyric \"lick my butt.\"</strong></p> <p><strong>Parker:</strong> [Laughs] Oh yeah! That's true.</p> <p><strong>Do you feel that you seek to offend people, or do you find that insinuation offensive?</strong></p> <p><strong>Parker:</strong> No, in fact, it's funny, I was talking to my parents about this ...</p> <p><strong>Stone:</strong> No, we're just offensive.</p> <p><strong>Parker:</strong> Yeah. I was all nervous last night because the movie was playing ... Like, we've never seen the whole movie.</p> <p><strong>Stone:</strong> No one had ever seen it until last night.</p> <p><strong>Because you were cutting it to get the R rating?</strong></p> <p><strong>Stone:</strong> Because of the schedule we were on, no one had ever sat down and actually watched the entire movie on film, with the sound mix, start to finish, until it played in however many theaters.</p> <p><strong>Parker:</strong> I was really nervous, and my dad said, \"I don't understand why you're all nervous,\" and I said, \"I'm just really scared that people are getting really pissed off right now.\" Not scared, but just bummed out. And I realize that I really do - and I think Matt's the same way - if someone does really get offended by our movie, we don't feel good about it. We want people to love the movie, you know what I mean? Even psycho German lady the other day kinda bummed us out, you know? Because it was like, Come on, you didn't like it? Deep down, we want everyone to laugh and have a good time. We don't go, Oh, let's piss these people off.</p> <p><strong>Stone:</strong> We just are offensive people. I mean, I offend people all the time in everyday life and I wish I didn't; I just fucking say the wrong thing.</p> <p><strong>What do you think creates a person who naturally offends by accident?</strong></p> <p><strong>Stone:</strong> When that person is just really charismatic and cool!</p> <p><strong>Parker:</strong> No, I think we just deal with everything with humor. Everything. We say all the time, \"I know that if one of us got cancer tomorrow, we would be joking about it.\" It's just the way we deal with stuff. A lot of people with no sense of humor think that that means that you just basically don't care about anyone or anything, and it's not true.</p> <p>Ultimately, I think we're both pretty optimistic people, too. A lot of this movie came out of, you're laughing at people because you're sort of saying, \"Dude, relax.\" You have the Michael Moores of the world and all these people telling you, \"These people are evil and America's going to be destroyed in a matter of five years!\" And it's just, to us, not that dire. It's like, you know what? Our lives are pretty fucking great. And a lot of the lives we see around us are pretty fucking great, and everything's gonna be OK. That's just our basic philosophy.</p> <p><strong>What about the people who'd say, Well, you've got to get out of your bubble and check out the world and see how fucked up things are for everyone else.</strong></p> <p><strong>Stone:</strong> It's about optimism, though. That's the big thing about the movie; that end message is about American optimism. And that's the difference between America and the rest of the world, because if you go to Europe, people are not optimistic about the future there. And Americans do have a naive optimism about that - it's not just us, and the fact that we live in this L.A. bubble - I think all Americans have this naive optimism and have for a long time. And a lot of times it's naive, and it's unfounded, and it's even wrong, but it's somehow that optimism that keeps America looking forward and trying to make the world better. And I really do think that's something that's unique to America that doesn't exist in a lot of the world.</p> <p><strong>And it can be a self-fulfilling prophecy.</strong></p> <p><strong>Stone:</strong> Exactly. A lot of times it fuels the good things. Sure, it's stupid, and a lot of times it's a big smile while eating a big shit sandwich, but you just keep going, you know?</p> <p><strong>Parker:</strong> But another thing that goes along with the optimism part of it is basically the idea of, well, if I'm not going to have a fucking great time and I'm not going to really appreciate and enjoy and say life is great, then there really is no hope. Because all of the hope for the world is that there can be a great life, and to me, I'm proof of that, that there can be a great life. And yes, it's all about trying to dole that out to as many people as possible, but it's also about, when you have a great country, and it all works, and your life is awesome, then be able to say so! But for some reason, it's almost taboo to say, My fucking life is awesome, and I have a great time, and I have a sweet house and a nice car. People are like [using a scolding voice], \"Hey, hey, hey, hey!\"</p> <p><strong>Stone:</strong> Especially the richest people in the world, which we know some of in this town, you know? [Angry voice] \"The world is fucked up!\"</p> <p><strong>Parker:</strong> Look, we were below middle class growing up, and I had a dream that someday things were gonna be better, and I assume that's the way it is in Third World countries. So, if you're not going to enjoy the dream, then there's no hope for anything.</p> <p><strong>Stone:</strong> I think that when Trey wrote \"America! Fuck, Yeah!\" - that song? That, to me, encapsulates it. We could talk for hours about America's overzealous stance overseas, but there's also, you know, \"America! Fuck, Yeah!\" too. And somehow that song encapsulates an hourlong conversation. When people ask me, \"What's your attitude about America?\" I think of Trey's song. That's the perfect way to put it. It's awesome, and you have to admit it's also a little cheesily testosterone-driven at the same time ...</p> <p><strong>A little cheesily testosterone-driven?</strong></p> <p><strong>Stone:</strong> Yeah. But. It's awesome.</p> <p><strong>After the movie's first scene, I really wondered if you could keep up that level of really sharp satire. Did you ever think, \"Ah, maybe we shouldn't put in the dick and asshole stuff, because we could make a piece of art that anyone could see and appreciate\"?</strong></p> <p><strong>Stone:</strong> [Laughs.] Nope. I wish that would've occurred to us earlier.</p> <p><strong>Parker:</strong> Although the tone of the movie did change completely after shooting that scene, because we shot that scene first. The script was written ... a bit more like \"South Park,\" but even a little more jokey than \"South Park,\" and I think it's good that we wrote it that way, because Paramount had to say, \"OK, comedy? Oh, this is a funny script.\" Whereas, this movie, as a script, there are so many times where, if you were reading the script, you'd say, \"Where's the joke?\" Because so much of the joke is coming off of [the marionettes] trying to do drama. So we had way more jokey-jokes in the script, more like fucking Adam Sandler jokes - I mean, not that bad, but ...</p> <p><strong>Stone:</strong> But joke jokes.</p> <p><strong>Parker:</strong> And after shooting that first scene, we were like, Dude, we've gotta take all the jokes out of this movie.</p> <p><strong>Stone:</strong> Then we did a pass where there was not a single joke or laugh in the whole movie, it was kind of just a fucked-up, serious, weird satire. But that was no fun to watch, and we're no good at doing that kind of thing.</p> <p><strong>Parker:</strong> So then we started putting all the pussy and dick stuff in.</p> <p><strong>Stone:</strong> But then it became, saying that kind of stuff, but with the serious music, and the collision of the music and the tone? That became what the movie was about. I think that most people will get that, but there will be people that don't get that. And if you don't get that central conceit of the movie, you'll just hate the movie more and more and more.</p> <p><strong>Yeah, but screw those people, right?</strong></p> <p><strong>Stone:</strong> Well, I agree, but that's what people have to get, or they're gonna be like, \"What the fuck is this crap?\" And that's generational.</p> <p><strong>Not spelling it all out clearly, though, makes it so much better than it would be if you connected all the dots.</strong></p> <p><strong>Parker:</strong> Oh, yeah. For sure.</p> <p><strong>Stone:</strong> But I also think that's generational, because 85-year-olds didn't grow up watching \"Top Gun\" and all the other movies that have that kind of stupid structure seared into them.</p> <p><strong>I have to ask you quickly about <a href=\"http://www.drudgereport.com/penn.htm\">the letter from Sean Penn</a> (who, along with other Hollywood political activists like Tim Robbins and Susan Sarandon, is satirized in the film), which was posted on Matt Drudge ...</strong></p> <p><strong>Parker:</strong> We got it the day before, actually. He was nice enough to send it to us before he sent it to the world.</p> <p><strong>Stone:</strong> I remember when I got it, thinking that it read like a fucking open letter. It doesn't really read like it's really to us. That was my first thing; I was like, this doesn't read like a private letter.</p> <p><strong>And then the next day it was an open letter.</strong></p> <p><strong>Stone:</strong> Yeah! The next day it was open.</p> <p><strong>Parker:</strong> I mean, I just don't understand. If he really is pissed, why would he do us that huge of a favor? I mean, seriously, there is nothing he could've done to help this movie more.</p> <p><strong>Stone:</strong> He just proved that we nailed him so perfectly in the movie. Because if you read the letter what he says in the movie is exactly like what he would say in the movie.</p> <p><strong>It was actually the marionette that wrote you that letter! I like how he sets you two up in the letter as such losers. \"I remember seeing you at a party. I remember how you dropped my name to appear witty ...\"</strong></p> <p><strong>Parker:</strong> By the way, we've never met him. You do meet a lot of people. We've met a lot, and maybe we've even forgotten some, but I would remember Sean Penn. We never met Sean Penn, either one of us.</p> <p><strong>Stone:</strong> But when you read it, the letter comes from such a high place of arrogance, you know, [deep, serious voice] \"You guys are young guys! If you don't have children, you can't say anything about anything!\" And the whole voting thing. All we ever said was that we thought that uninformed people should not vote - on either side of the political spectrum. It doesn't matter who you're gonna vote for. If you really don't know who you're gonna vote for, or are uninformed, or haven't really thought about it? Just stay home. Don't let people fucking shame you into going to the polls.</p> <p><strong>Parker:</strong> If you have absolutely no idea, fuck it.</p> <p><strong>Stone:</strong> If you really don't know or you're just going to vote for George Bush because he's already in office, or you're gonna vote for John Kerry because he's on the cover of Rolling Stone, don't do that. That's lame. Just stay home. That's all we ever said.</p> <p><strong>Publicist:</strong> We really have to wrap up now.</p> <p><strong>Well, in parting, do you have a special message for all those undecided voters out there?</strong></p> <p><strong>Stone:</strong> Stay home.</p> <p><strong>Parker:</strong> Don't vote!</p> <p><strong>Stone:</strong> And it's no big deal. If you don't want to vote, you don't have to. Fuck that vote or die shit. I hate that.</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> About the writer: Heather Havrilesky is Salon's TV critic.

  "<p>Will baseball prove an early predictor of the US election? Tonight the <a href=\"http://mlb.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/mlb/ps/y2004/home.jsp?view=bos_nyy\">New York Yankees face the Boston Red Sox </a>in the first of a best-of-seven series to win a spot in the baseball World Series (and yes, we know how ironic that name is. Go away). </p> <p>But consider this, fans: the Republican convention was held in New York. The Democratic national convention was held in Boston. The blog's Pet Elephant sports a button - courtesy of our blogging correspondent to the Boston convention - that reads: Kerry rules, Yankees suck.</p> <p>The Elephant has been wrong before: his 'Don't Attack Iraq' button came to nothing. </p> <p>Though his species may indicate otherwise, the Elephant is a staunch Democrat. His political conversion came about solely because no one in the Guardian's upper management saw fit to send a London-based blogger on an all-expenses paid trip to New York to bring back buttons. (We already have a correspondent in New York, they argued, the cheap so-and-so's.) </p> <p>Anyhow, if the Red Sox lose the series, our little stuffed friend may become the Elephant of Lost Causes.

  "A few days after he was paralysed from the neck down in a riding accident in 1995, Superman actor Christopher Reeve told his wife, Dana: \"Perhaps we should let me go.\" <p>His despair was understandable, but it proved short-lived: within months, Reeve, who died at the weekend aged 52, had become a passionate campaigner for medical research, driven by a combination of optimism and anger that led both to controversy and unprecedented scientific advances. </p> <p>Joining the tributes yesterday, the Democratic presidential candidate, John Kerry, said Reeve had been \"truly America's hero\" for his advocacy of stem cell research. </p> <p>The actor suffered a heart attack and fell into a coma at his home in Pound Ridge, near Bedford, New York, on Saturday after developing a systemic infection from a pressure wound. He died in hospital the next day, surrounded by his family. </p> <p>His support for stem cell research had turned a controversial issue into a mainstream matter, keeping it high on the political agenda in the US even in the last days of his life. </p> <p>Wise Young, who treated Reeve after his accident, yesterday told the Guardian he was \"heartbroken\", and applauded his patient's legacy. \"He's been given a lot of credit for raising money and publicity, but one thing that isn't said a lot is how much he motivated scientists. He raised the ambition of the research enterprise by using the word 'cure', as opposed to 'rehabilitation' or 'restoring some function' ... When he asked me a few weeks after his injury whether there was any therapy that could help, and I said yes, he immediately asked how long, and I said seven years. He said: 'Well, let's make that a goal.' So he went to the media and told them: 'If we fail, we tried.' I think that was his attitude.\" </p> <p>But while Reeve sought to be \"realistically optimistic\", he never hid the realities of his condition. \"It bothers me when people say, 'You played Superman, now you are Superman',\" he once observed. </p> <p>\"They mean well, but they don't know what I go through in the middle of the night.\" </p> <p>Yesterday Dana thanked his personal staff of nurses and aides \"as well as the millions of fans from around the world who have supported and loved my husband over the years\". </p> <p>The actor's wealth, celebrity and determination ensured that he received the best and most advanced care. </p> <p>But pressure sores are one of the biggest health fears of people with spinal injuries. They develop because areas of the skin, such as the buttocks and the backs of the legs and ankles, are in almost permanent contact with beds or chairs. </p> <p>The pressure reduces the blood supply to the skin and causes the tissue underneath to atrophy. Without attention, the damage can spread to the muscle and as far as the bone. If it reaches the bloodstream, it can prove lethal. </p> <p>In Reeve's case, the treatment, which involved administering intravenous antibiotics to his already weakened body, triggered a cardiac arrest. </p> <p>\"Christopher's condition was one that was fairly frail and susceptible to problems and his body had taken a bit of of an onslaught. When you have an infection like that it really does take it out of you,\" said Paul Smith, executive director of the Spinal Injuries Association, which Reeve supported. </p> <p>He said the actor had brought attention and funding to an often ignored condition. \"He also showed you can live your life and that it isn't the end of everything important. He believed we needed to look to the future, but also to support people here and now.\" </p> <p>Lord May of Oxford, the president of the Royal Society, said: \"His invaluable contribution has raised awareness of this issue in a way that no one within the medical or scientific communities could ever have hoped to achieve.\" </p> <p>Last night, President Bush issued a statement saying <b> </b> he and his wife, Laura, were saddened by Reeve's death and sent prayers and condolences to his family and friends. </p> <p>\"He will be remembered as an accomplished actor and for his dedicated advocacy for those with physical disabilities,\" he said. </p> <p>The actor and comedian Robin Williams said: \"The world has lost a tremendous activist and artist, and an inspiration for people worldwide. I have lost a great friend.\" The film director Michael Winner described Reeve as the \"archetypal movie star\" and a man of great charisma, while Susannah York, who starred with him in Superman, praised his generosity of spirit. </p> <p>Reeve was a virtual unknown when he was picked from 200 hopefuls to star in Superman. The film and its sequels grossed $300m (\u00a3167m), but Reeve sought to \"escape the cape\" in later screen and stage work. </p> <p>After his accident, he successfully lobbied Congress for better insurance protection against catastrophic injury, became chairman of the American Paralysis Association and created his own foundation to raise money for research and support those with disabilities. He also revived his professional career, directing films and winning a Screen Actors Guild award for his role in a remake of the Hitchcock thriller Rear Window. </p> <p>By 2002 Reeve had regained sensation in much of his body and could move some of his fingers and toes. Doctors described the progress as remarkable given the severity of his injuries. He could also breathe for longer periods without a respirator. Hopes that he would be walking by his 50th birthday, however, proved baseless . </p> <p>Speaking to the Guardian that year, he said: \"I find that it's best to think, well, what can I do today? Is there something I can accomplish, a phone call I can make, a letter I can write, a person I can talk to, that will move things forward?\" </p> <p>In a recent interview with Reader's Digest, to be published this year, the actor said he had become more patient. But he added: \"I also know that, with time, I'm beginning to fight issues of ageing as well as long-term paralysis.\" </p> <p>Reeve appeared to be coming to terms with the idea that big improvements in his health were unlikely. </p> <p>In a documentary filmed in May and due to be shown on the BBC next week, he described suffering setbacks and said his recovery had plateaued. \"I'm in very good health, but it hasn't turned into an improvement in function that would really change my life.\" But he added: \"I feel very confident that I'm strong enough ... that I'll be prepared for whatever medical intervention comes my way.\" </p> <p>In the same film, Dana said that last winter was \"very, very tough\". </p> <p>\"Pretty much December was all about the hospital and trying to get better,\" she said. \"And at the hospital he got some more sacral wounds, which are very hard to get rid of, pressure sores, skin breakdown, and it can completely alter your quality of life, and it did for him.\" </p>",
  "<p>In his third column for Guardian Unlimited, US political blogger Markos Moulitsas writes about the emergence of Furious George.</p> <blockquote> <p>The evolution of George Bush's persona over the past few weeks is startling for even the most casual observers. Only a short while ago, Bush was a strong, decisive leader and Kerry was a weak, flip-flopping Massachusetts liberal. The Bush campaign expected those images to carry them through the November elections: it had cost them more than $200m (\u00a3112m) to build those caricatures and they had every reason to expect a solid return on their investment.</p> </blockquote> <blockquote> But those images were built on a carefully crafted stage. Despite all the flaws in the US electoral process we still force the candidates to exit that bubble a handful of times during the election, and it is some credit to the system that those three 90-minute debates can still determine the fate of an election. This year, they have helped introduce the nation to Furious George. </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uselections2004/markosmoulitsas/story/0,15139,1325454,00.html\">Read on here</a> and catch up with Guardian Unlimited's special report on the US election <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uselections2004\">here</a>.</p>",

  "<p>Jenny, one of my regular morning carers, brought me the news of the death of Christopher Reeve when she came to get me up this morning. She looked nervous as she told me, as if he was a member of my own family. I must have spoken of him often, as I have been receiving emails and telephone calls from friends all morning. I have never met him, nor spoken to him, but he has loomed large in my life since I broke my neck four and a half years ago and suffered a paralysis almost as severe as his. </p> <p>Reeve was always a controversial figure among people with spinal injuries, and particularly with the more traditional medical establishments of spinal injury units. His message of hope for a cure was regarded as irresponsible and misleading. Whenever his name was mentioned it was either with frustration or a sneer, and I have often heard it said: \"His name is a dirty word in this house.\" </p> <p>It was thought that he distracted people from the essential business of adapting to life as a paraplegic or a tetraplegic, encouraging us to live for a false future rather than a realistic present. In spinal units all over the country, and probably all over the world, the newly injured are taught to accept their fate, often with almost brutal insistence. Learning how to cope with the practicalities of life - eating, drinking, dressing, taking care of your skin always took precedence over psychological adjustment to the catastrophe that had befallen us - as if they were mutually exclusive. </p> <p>Chris probably was overoptimistic about the prospects of a cure - and certainly in his goal of being able to walk again by the time he was 50 - but he gave hope to many, including me, and he really did put his money where his mouth was, raising millions of dollars for spinal research through the Christopher Reeve Paralysis Foundation. He insisted that all research funded by the foundation be focused on some aspect of a cure and that projects would only be chosen after input from lay people suffering from the condition - not always a popular attitude with scientists. </p> <p>I well remember his accident in 1995 when he fell from his horse. I was an active walker and mountaineer at the time and remember thinking that, had it happened to me, I would rather have died there and then than live paralysed all my life. When I broke my neck in Bolivia in 2000, one of the doctors transporting me home told my wife, Val: \"Before long you will wish he had died.\" He was wrong and I was wrong earlier. Chris always lived in the present, setting up the foundation, writing, acting in and directing films, tirelessly harassing the Christian fundamentalists running the American government on the subject of stem cell research. Nor did he ignore the practicalities of life; his foundation gave grants to disabled people struggling to raise funds for equipment they desperately needed. </p> <p>He didn't hold out for a full and dramatic recovery, but he maintained his fitness with physiotherapy and exercise so that he would be able to take advantage of anything that came along. He finally got off the ventilator he hated so much when he had a computer implant inserted in his chest to regulate his breathing. </p> <p>I was approached to be involved with a film being made about him, shown in one version in America and another, by the BBC, in Britain. As it happened, I wasn't included in the final edit. However, I was shown in confidence film of the progress he had made - his recovery of sensation, his ability to take a tentative step in water, to move his arm and one or two fingers. Val and I burst into tears when we saw it, and I remember the surge of hope that went through me. It is ironic that a man as fit as he was should die as a consequence of a pressure sore becoming infected. </p> <p>I can think of a number of ways to pay tribute to his memory. To fight for the right to physiotherapy in the community for anyone who is disabled in this country would be a fitting start; to help raise funds for spinal research (anyone interested should go on the web to <a href=\"http://www.spinal-research.org\">spinal-research.org</a>) and, perhaps most of all, by voting in the US for John Kerry in the presidential election in November so that, among very many other good reasons, stem cell research can proceed unhindered by ideological disputes in this powerhouse of science and technology. </p> <p>In the eyes of so many, Reeve was the personification of Superman. In real life he was an actor trying to do serious work, an activist unafraid of the structures of power, a father and devoted husband and a friend to all of us who share his fate.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:edguiton@yahoo.com\">edguiton@yahoo.com</a></p>",
  "\"Security? I don't really get that,\" said Fatiha Occhialini, one of several dozen \"soccer moms\" sitting on the touchline under the Pennsylvanian night sky. <p>\"I feel safe, being around people here in my area. I don't feel threatened at all,\" she added, adjusting her blanket against the autumn chill. Looking around at the bucolic sporting scene under the floodlights, it was hard to see how anyone could really disagree.</p> <p>Until the last few weeks of this presidential contest, Republican strategists have been quietly effective at doing precisely that - convincing the likes of Mrs Occhialini that they are under imminent threat of attack: a danger that will only worsen with wimpy surrender-monkey John Kerry in the White House.</p> <p>In the 1990s, Bill Clinton successfully wooed the soccer mom, convincing the caring, responsible but comfortable suburbanite that there was room for compassion in politics as long as the books were balanced. Al Gore picked up the ball and continued to run with it, scoring an 11-point advantage over Bush among women voters in 2000 - thanks largely to overwhelming support from single and ethnic minority women. </p> <p>In the post September 11 world, however, the soccer mom began to seem an anachronism. Democrat senator Joe Biden blamed his party's defeat in the 2002 midterms on its failure to listen to women. The agenda now was... \"not schools, not prescription drugs. It was 'what are you doing to protect my kids against terrorists? Soccer moms are security moms now.\" </p> <p>Although she is still making up her mind which way to vote, Mrs Occhialini's pragmatic view is not good news for the Republicans, and may offer some clues as to why there has been a significant reversal in women's voting intentions in the past month. </p> <p>A New York Times/CBS survey in mid-September showed Bush with a five point lead. The Reuters/Zogby poll released last weekend shows Kerry ahead by nine points - close to the 10-point margin that pollsters say he must hold if he has any chance of winning. </p> <p>As Parkland High School battled against Central Catholic for the top spot in the Lehigh Valley Conference league, I found plenty of mothers in this swing-region of Pennsylvania who were committed to voting for the president, but only a few who put safety fears at the top of the list. </p> <p>\"I'm supporting George Bush. I do have concerns about Kerry keeping us as safe. I don't like the idea of Edwards taking over, if anything happened to him,\" said Lori Lett. \"There's always fear around, so it's nothing special right now.\" </p> <p>A few yards along the touchline, Kim Watts was waiting for her son to get into the game, from the Central Catholic subs-bench. \"Security is one of the most important things, but I'm taking everything into consideration. I'm very concerned, having a son who's so close to military age.\" </p> <p>\"I just like George Bush, and I'm not sure whether Kerry will keep us as safe. I feel there's too much negativity around now and I just wish this election was over already,\" she added, her eyes wandering back to the action on the pitch. </p> <p>As a parting shot, she gets reflective: \"Am I fearful? I just think the administration's being honest.\" </p> <p>Margaret Didomenico and Karen Strelchun are good friends, but poles apart in their politics. \"You wouldn't be standing here, Margaret honey, if those people weren't fighting for you,\" said Mrs Strelchun, volunteering Iraq as her key issue, second only to her fervent support for the anti-abortion movement. </p> <p>\"They're not fighting for me,\" countered Mrs Didomenico. \"I don't think the president's done anything but put us in jeopardy. He dropped the Bin Laden issue and just ran to Iraq.\" </p> <p>Suddenly, football asserted itself again: \"They scored ... Oh man, we missed it. OK, we're done now.\" Their boys had gone one down, and my window for talking politics was over. </p> <p>Despite being told to leave the ground by the volatile Parkland High coach, for standing too close to the bench at half-time, I mooched around a little longer. </p> <p>There's no denying the passion in soccer here, although its status as a second-class sport is constantly reinforced. Parkland has its own cheerleading team of excitable young teens, but as soon as they're old enough, the girls move on to the American Football touchline. </p> <p>Sitting on the aluminium bleachers, I found another pair sitting together whose sons play alongside each other up front. Jocelyne Tshishinbi always sits to the right of her friend Angela Ottinger, for luck. In politics, their roles are reversed. </p> <p>\"I don't think Bush is keeping us safer than Kerry will. The main thing is Iraq. I want those kids back home and with their parents. They don't deserve it,\" said Haitian-born Mrs Tshishinbi.</p> <p>\"I do feel safe at home now,\" said Mrs Ottinger. \"Right now, I feel secure in knowing that we're probably not going to get hit again, with George Bush around. Maybe we'll find out soon how John Kerry would do.\" </p> <p>As Parkland increased their lead to 2-0 with another well-taken goal from a free kick, I asked some of the cheerleaders' moms what they made of the political contest. After a quick conference, one woman offered to speak for them all. Tellingly, her list was \"jobs, security and medical coverage\". She was reluctant to put them in order or priority. </p> <p>\"Bush is doing the best job he can,\" she added. \"But to be honest, I don't think it would make much difference who is running the country. If things are going to happen, they'll happen. We'll do the best we can to prevent it, and protect ourselves.\" </p> <p>Chants of \"Let's go Parkland\" filled the crisp autumn air at the final whistle, but there are still a few weeks to go in the bigger political contest and this switchable area of Pennsylvania will be crucial to the state-wide result. There are 21 electoral college votes at stake, and the president has been to the state 40 times since taking office. That's a clear sign of how much the Republicans want to win here. </p> <p>Chris Borick, the public opinion director at Muhlenberg College, has just released a telling local poll that confirms the nationwide trend that security moms are ceasing to be a minus for the Kerry campaign. </p> <p>\"A lot of the Bush campaign rhetoric, from 'W is for women' down to safety-related television ads, has been geared to winning the security moms over,\" said Mr Borick. </p> <p>\"There's now a 10-point gap among women in this area for Kerry over Bush. Kerry does seem to have managed to neutralise the security mom issue. In that first debate where he was saying he was going to hunt down terrorists and kill them - that was all language designed to reassure.\" </p> <p>Perhaps even more importantly for the final weeks of the campaign, the local poll is also showing that among the diminishing pool of undecideds, women are much more significant than men. Almost 10% of women are still making up their minds. Conforming to stereotype, only 3% of men are still unsure.</p>",
  "Equipment and materials that could be used to make nuclear weapons have disappeared from Iraq, the UN's nuclear watchdog warned yesterday. <p>Satellite imagery and investigations of nuclear sites in Iraq have caused alarm at the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). </p> <p>The agency found that in some cases entire buildings housing high-precision nuclear equipment had been dismantled; equipment that could be used to make a bomb, such as high-strength aluminium, had vanished from open storage areas, the agency said.</p> <p>In a report to the UN security council yesterday, the IAEA's director general, Mohamed ElBaradei, said the agency \"continues to be concerned about the widespread and apparently systematic dismantlement that has taken place at sites previously relevant to Iraq's nuclear programme and sites previously subject to ongoing monitoring and verification by the agency\".</p> <p>Before the war, the buildings had been monitored and tagged with IAEA seals to keep tabs on their function and content. But US authorities barred IAEA inspectors from returning to Iraq after the war began in March 2003, instead deploying US teams in an unsuccessful search for Iraqi weapons of mass destruction.</p> <p>Mr ElBaradei has therefore relied largely on satellite imagery in the latest report. IAEA teams were allowed into Iraq in June 2003 to investigate reports of widespread looting of storage rooms at the main nuclear complex, at Tuwaitha, and in August to take inventory of \"several tonnes\" of natural uranium in storage nearby. </p> <p>Anti-proliferation agreements mean the US occupying authorities and now the Iraqi interim government were responsible for informing the IAEA if they moved or exported any of that material or equipment. The IAEA said it had received no such reports. </p> <p>In a September 30 debate both the US president, George Bush, and his Democratic rival, John Kerry, identified nuclear proliferation as the greatest threat facing the US. </p> <p>In February 2003, a month before the US-led invasion of Iraq, Mr ElBaradei reported to the security council that Iraq's nuclear programme had been \"neutralised\" by December 1998. In the two and a half months his agency had in which to resume inspections during 2003, his teams found \"no evidence of ongoing prohibited nuclear or nuclear related activities in Iraq\".</p> <p>Last week a CIA report by the chief US weapons investigator, Charles Duelfer, agreed that Saddam Hussein had all but given up on his nuclear programme after the first Gulf war in 1991. </p> <p>But it now appears Iraq may pose a nuclear threat of a different sort: some military goods, including missile engines, that disappeared from Iraq after the US-led invasion later turned up in scrap yards in the Middle East and Europe. However, none of the equipment or material known to the IAEA as potentially useful in making nuclear bombs has been found, according to Mr ElBaradei.</p> <p>\"As the disappearance of such equipment and materials may be of proliferation significance, any state that has information about the location of such items should provide IAEA with that information,\" Mr ElBaradei said.</p>",

  "The evolution of George Bush's persona over the past few weeks is startling for even the most casual observers. Only a short while ago, Bush was a strong, decisive leader and Kerry was a weak, flip-flopping Massachusetts liberal. The Bush campaign expected those images to carry them through the November elections: it had cost them more than $200m (\u00a3112m) to build those caricatures and they had every reason to expect a solid return on their investment. <p>But those images were built on a carefully crafted stage. Despite all the flaws in the US electoral process we still force the candidates to exit that bubble a handful of times during the election, and it is some credit to the system that those three 90-minute debates can still determine the fate of an election. This year, they have helped introduce the nation to Furious George.</p> <p>Bush's political operators have worked overtime to make \"angry\" a pejorative term this political cycle. They wielded the \"too angry\" attack against Howard Dean in the primaries, when it seemed Dean would be the Democratic nominee, and it helped destroy Dean's candidacy. Republicans again shouted \"too angry\" to discredit Al Gore's series of impassioned anti-Bush speeches earlier this year. </p> <p>The \"too angry\" claims successfully marginalised the content of those speeches - blistering indictments of an incompetent administration. But what happens when your best attack line is a double-edged sword? </p> <p>Bush's operation has taken stage management to extremes. His handlers have figured - correctly - that the press conference format suits their man poorly and is to be avoided at all costs. His last primetime press conference was in April 2004, and he has had only two with the White House press corps since late August - both of them with the Iraqi prime minister, Ayad Allawi, at his side. (The Bush campaign actually wrote Allawi's speech in order to squeeze out precious political points.)</p> <p>Bush's campaign appearances are not much better. While Kerry's events are open to the public, Bush's affairs require the signing of a \"loyalty oath\". Quietly wearing an anti-Bush T-shirt or badge is grounds for expulsion. </p> <p>Bush faces only adoring audiences vetted by the campaign's enforcers. At his town hall events, questions are planted for maximum political effect. At one, a veteran merely got up and requested permission to salute his commander in chief. Compelling visuals? Perhaps. But it does little to acquaint Bush with reality.</p> <p>Campaign commercials do their best to paint an alternative reality in which Bush is an effective leader and Kerry is anything but. Entire media networks, such as Fox News and Sinclair Broadcasting, prop up Bush in a way that would make their fellow propagandists in North Korea and Cuba proud. Sinclair, in fact, will pre-empt local programming on its 62 stations to air an anti-Kerry movie days before the election - unless a <a href=\"http://www.boycottsbg.com\" target=\"_new\"> blog-led boycott</a> forces a reversal.</p> <p>Given the force of Republican efforts to deify Bush, his debate performances came as a big shock to many Americans. They showed a Bush quick to anger, indecisiveness, pettiness and petulance. The sheltered Bush was clearly unprepared for the debate and unprepared to face criticism. In fact, it seemed to take him by surprise. No one seemed to have told him he had critics.</p> <p>After his first debate performance, Bush was in a quandary. He had to stem his erosion in the polls, but to do so would require attacking Kerry and furthering the perception that he was too angry to be president.</p> <p>So how did he respond? By getting even more angry. He not only viciously attacked Kerry but also took out the moderator and several questioners in the process. Someone, somewhere, labelled Bush Furious George - a clever turn on HA Rey's Curious George children's books and an appellation that took firm hold in the online and, increasingly, offline worlds. </p> <p>Bush acted like the proverbial ugly American trying to be understood in a foreign land, cranking up the volume and shrillness to make his points while Kerry sat by serenely. The contrast was impossible to miss as Bush became increasingly unhinged. Even on the road, Bush's desperation is palpable as the rhetoric soars to angrier heights.</p> <p>Bush is now hemmed in. With poll after poll showing small Kerry leads, he needs to do something to regain the momentum. His campaign's attack ads have kept him in the game but he is not pulling away. Furthermore, he is well below the 50% mark in most key battleground state polls - a mark of political vulnerability. </p> <p>If he cannot convince people to vote for him, he will have to convince people to vote against Kerry, and to do that he has to attack, attack, attack. And since it takes more skill than Bush possesses to attack without appearing angry, well, he's in a real bind. </p> <p>Bush's political operation has conditioned the electorate to distrust \"anger\". It has made the charge a cornerstone of its smear effort against Democrats such as Dean and Gore. For a campaign that lives by the smear, it is poetic justice to see the tables turned.

  "Burma's military junta, one of the world's most oppressive regimes, must be pleased with its weekend's work at the 39-nation Asia-Europe (Asem) meeting in Hanoi. <p>Far from condemning the generals' continuing, egregious abuses of human rights, Asem expressed a vague hope that the regime's spurious \"national reconciliation process\" would succeed and \"looked forward to the early lifting of restrictions on political parties\". </p> <p>A threatened EU boycott of the meeting, attended for the first time by the junta's representatives, failed to materialise. So, too, did any mention in the final communique of the plight of Burma's detained pro-democracy leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, and her persecuted National League for Democracy (NLD). </p> <p>Instead, the same Burmese junta that overturned the NLD's 1990 election victory and which the International Labour Organisation has accused of \"crimes against humanity\" was formally inducted into Asem. </p> <p>Much of the blame for this outcome may be laid at the door of leading Asian countries, particularly China, which maintain normal political and trade relations with Burma. </p> <p>Japan's prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, said Asem membership would \"encourage Myanmar [the junta's name for Burma] in a positive direction\". </p> <p>Smaller Asian countries such as Vietnam seem increasingly wary, after Afghanistan and Iraq, of any perceived attempt to foist western values upon them. </p> <p>This sentiment has been exploited by Rangoon's state-run media. \"Democracy cannot be built by outside pressure ... democracy cannot prevail by foreign invasion, either,\" an official commentary said at the weekend. </p> <p>The EU, in theory, has what it calls a \"common position\" on Burma. It says the present situation is \"unacceptable\". But differences on how best to proceed, influenced by commercial considerations and disagreements on tactics, also undermine effective action. </p> <p>France's president, Jacques Chirac, said in Hanoi he hoped additional EU sanctions would not be necessary because they \"will hurt the poorest people\". </p> <p>But France fears its investments in Burma, including those of Total Oil, may also be hurt. </p> <p>Measures announced by EU foreign ministers in Brussels yesterday appear significantly weaker as a result of French lobbying. </p> <p>According to the Foreign Office, the curbs on new foreign investment in state-owned businesses, and on visas, amount to an important tightening of existing sanctions aimed at the regime, and not at the Burmese people. </p> <p>But John Jackson, director of the Burma Campaign UK, said the EU's measures were \"full of loopholes\" and fell woefully short of the broader, targeted investment sanctions which were necessary. </p> <p>Decrying international inaction, Archbishop Desmond Tutu issued a plea last week on behalf of Ms Suu Kyi, a fellow Nobel peace laureate, whose latest period of house arrest has lasted since May, 2003. </p> <p>\"The words of protest at her detention from world leaders ring hollow when they do not translate into action,\" he wrote in the International Herald Tribune. </p> <p>\"Suu Kyi and the people of Myanmar have not called for a military coalition to invade their country. They have simply asked for the maximum diplomatic and economic pressure against Myanmar's brutal dictators.\" </p> <p>The generals, Archbishop Tutu said, can \"smell inertia\". </p> <p>The outlines of Burma's misery are clear, despite limited access to the country. They include the holding of 1,300 political prisoners, arbitrary arrests, low spending on health and education, forced labour, exploitation of child soldiers, harassment of ethnic minorities and official connivance in opium trafficking. </p> <p>But for all the debate at Asem and Brussels, despite tougher US sanctions, despite the unflagging efforts of international activists and the successes of their disinvestment campaign, and despite a recent, personal intervention by Kofi Annan, the UN secretary-general, Burma's shameful oppression persists largely unchecked. </p> <p>Mr Annan asked that the UN's envoy and its human rights investigator be allowed to return to Burma. Neither has visited for many months. But the generals, buoyed by international divisions, have not deigned to reply.</p>",

  "<p>One of America's biggest television companies has announced plans to broadcast a film days before the presidential election that portrays the Democratic candidate John Kerry as betraying his fellow soldiers in Vietnam. </p> <p>The conservative Sinclair Broadcast Group will reportedly present the film as news on the 62 local channels it owns nationwide. </p> <p>The film will replace normal primetime programmes supplied by the national networks and reach up to a quarter of the electorate, many in critical battleground states, about a week before the election on November 2. </p> <p>In the film, Stolen Honour: Wounds That Never Heal, former US prisoners of war claim that their North Vietnamese interrogators used anti-war statements by Mr Kerry to undermine morale and persuade them to admit war crimes. </p> <p>A press release for the film, made by a conservative journalist and ex-marine, Carlton Sherwood, accused Mr Kerry of \"lies, false testimony and distortions\" for his remarks to Congress in 1971, saying US troops had been responsible for atrocities. </p> <p>The press release alleges that \"in mere moments in 1971, Kerry willingly gave the North Vietnamese what the brave PoWs had endured torture and solitary confinement to avoid saying\". </p> <p>Terry McCauliffe, the Democratic party chairman, said the the film was \"garbage\", and announced his intention to mount a legal challenge. </p> <p>Mr Kerry has been dogged by such attacks for more than two months, mostly in the form of advertisements paid for by a group calling itself Swift Boat Veterans for Truth. </p> <p>The Swift Boat advertisements, questioning Mr Kerry's combat record and criticising his activism in the early 1970s, helped give George Bush a clear lead in the polls which he has only lost in the past fortnight, after two lacklustre debate performances. </p> <p>Chad Clanton, a Kerry campaign spokesman, said: \"George Bush lost the first two debates according to every public poll, and now his allies are kicking into overdrive to distract from policy failures on Iraq and on the economy.\" </p> <p>\"If they move forward with this, they will be obliterating every decent journalistic standard in the book.\" </p> <p>Mr Sherwood's company, Red White And Blue Productions, has denied receiving support from the Bush campaign to make the film. Funding, it said, \"was made possible by Pennsylvania veterans\". Sinclair executives did not return a call seeking comment yesterday. </p> <p>They reportedly plan to define the programme as news, which under broadcasting law does not require equal time to be given for a response. </p> <p>Democrats will file a legal complaint today with the federal election commission arguing the broadcast represents an illegal campaign contribution. Democratic senators have also said they will appeal to the federal communications commission (FCC), to investigate the transmission of what they describe as free political advertising. </p> <p>The FCC is chaired by Michael Powell, the son of the secretary of state, Colin Powell. </p> <p>Under US broadcasting rules, the film actually gives airtime to Mr Kerry. Andrew Jay Schwartzman, who heads the Media Access Project watchdog, said: \"The way our equal time law works depends on what candidate is appearing on the air - so the equal time rule would run to Bush, not to Kerry. It does not provide Kerry a right to reply.\" </p> <p>\"What this shows is the dangers of media concentration. These are the problems that arise when one company controls 62 channels.\" </p> <p>Mark Hyman, Sinclair's vice-president for corporate relations, told the New York Times the company had invited Mr Kerry to appear after the film to answer the charges. \"There are certainly serious allegations that are levelled; we would very much like to get his response,\" Mr Hyman said. </p> <p>Mr Clanton said that although the Kerry camp would rule nothing out, \"it's hard to take an offer seriously from a group with such an obvious political agenda\". </p> <p>The film puts the Kerry campaign in a difficult position. Democrats said the campaign was too slow to respond to the original Swift Boat attacks; yet it is aware that its complaints will only provide publicity for Stolen Honour. </p> <p>Michael Moore, the director of the anti-Bush film Fahrenheit 9/11, wants to make it available on a pay-per-view basis on the eve of the election, but any audience is likely to be tiny compared to a film shown at primetime on 62 channels. </p> <p>The row has drawn attention to the role of television news. </p> <p>Fox News has established itself as a conservative network, while CBS has been under fire for broadcasting a documentary about Mr Bush's national guard record in September.</p>",
  "The opposition candidate Sergei Bagapsh said yesterday that the election commission in the breakaway Abkhazia region of Georgia had declared him the winner of the October 3 presidential election. <p>The election fell into confusion when officials repeatedly delayed announcing the winner, although they acknowledged that Mr Bagapsh was in the lead. </p> <p>Interfax news agency reported that the ruling that Mr Bagapsh had 50.8% of the vote, enough to avoid a run-off with Raul Khadzhimba, was a majority decision. Mr Khadzhimba, who was supported by the outgoing president, had complained of violations </p> <p>Abkhazia is not recognised internationally, and Georgian officials said the election was illegal.</p>",
  "<p>You were well advised to leave your pity at the door of Christopher Reeve's airy, sun-filled home, hidden amid the rolling meadows and white wooden barns of upstate New York. What struck you first, as he was steered into the room, was his commanding height: his throne-like wheelchair lifted his broad-shouldered bulk off the ground; sitting down, you found yourself tilting your head upwards to look at him. </p> <p>The accident's power over him was diminishing, he said, as his ventilator sucked and hissed. He no longer snapped awake in the quiet hours, forced to confront, all over again, the fact that he had no sensation from the neck down. He paid no attention as his nurse drained the contents of a tube hidden in his trouser-leg into a black bottle; he said he didn't even need to turn away when he was driven past the barn where he kept Buck, the thoroughbred horse from which he had been thrown in 1995, breaking his neck. But learning to live with his paralysis wasn't the same as resigning himself to it. \"I've still never had a dream that I'm disabled,\" he said. \"Never.\" He had vowed, controversially, to walk again by the age of 50. At the time, that deadline was three weeks away. </p> <p>Walking by 50 had only ever been a hope, not a prediction, Reeve insisted. But what made the news of his death so acutely disorienting yesterday was the fact that, on some level, so many of us thought that, eventually - albeit a few years behind schedule - he might actually do it. Of course, he had always stressed that his advocacy of stem-cell research wasn't a self-centred quest. Ordinary disabled people were the real superheroes, he often said, in response to the inevitable movie-themed questions. But for the rest of us, the personal narrative was too seductive to resist: Superman, brought down to earth, ultimately triumphs again through sheer force of will. </p> <p>He only went so far in discouraging that kind of thinking. \"I want things to happen quickly,\" he said recently. \"I certainly want to benefit within my lifetime. I don't want to get out of this wheelchair at the age of 75 ... I'm not willing to resign myself to being an advocate for research that will benefit people only after I'm gone. I'm not that noble.\" </p> <p>By the time he died at the weekend, aged 52, and from the most cruelly peripheral of causes - heart failure following the infection of a bedsore - he had repeatedly astonished his doctors with motor improvements through intense physical therapy. He had regained the movement of several fingers, and some muscles in his arms, along with a degree of sensation. \"It means I can feel my kids' touch,\" he told me when we met, a little over two years ago. \"It makes all the difference in the world.\" Things were moving ahead on the wider battlefront, too: with an irony that may yet come to influence the American election, Reeve slipped into a coma a day after being mentioned by John Kerry in Friday's presidential debate in support of an extension in stem cell research, a policy George Bush opposes. </p> <p>Reeve frequently spoke of his dismay that politics had got in the way of scientific progress, but that in itself was an unavoidably political position, and he was unusually scathing in propounding it. \"We've had a severe violation of the separation of church and state in the handling of what to do about this emerging technology,\" he said. \"There are religious groups - the Jehovah's Witnesses, I believe - who think it's a sin to have a blood transfusion. Well, what if the president for some reason decided to listen to them, instead of to the Catholics, which is the group he really listens to in making his decisions about embryonic stem cell research?\" A few days after our interview, he issued a statement apologising if he had offended Catholics. But there was no doubting the intensity of his anger. </p> <p>Despite everything, though, Reeve was lucky, and he knew it: he had little difficulty affording an annual bill of \u00a3270,000 to pay for his treatment and his team of assistants. His Westchester County estate looked like the set of some feelgood movie about wealthy rural America. It was this, in part, that provoked the accusation that he was spreading false hope among patients of more limited means: the Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer, himself a wheelchair user, called Reeve's public pronouncements \"disgracefully misleading\". In Reeve's view, he wrote, \"reality is a psychological crutch. His propaganda to that effect undermines those - particularly the young and newly injured - who are struggling to face reality, master it, and make a life for themselves from their wheelchairs.\" (In response, Reeve said many of his critics had been \"injured for so long, and their quality of life is so poor, that they don't dare to hope\".) </p> <p>Reeve had had plenty of luck before his accident: born into a comfortably-off New York family, the son of a novelist and a newspaper reporter, he had sailed through school into Cornell University, and thence, with his college friend Robin Williams, to the prestigious Juilliard drama school in Manhattan. Small film roles followed, along with a part in the cheesy daytime soap opera Love Of Life. But he was still essentially an unknown when he was picked for the role that would make his career. \"When I got Superman, my agent couldn't believe it,\" he told the author David Petrou in the late 1970s. \"As far as he was concerned, it was the biggest thing that could have happened. And my reaction, right off the bat, was, 'Yeah, fine. Now ... when do I start work?'\" Filming Superman in London, he met his first partner, Gae Exton; they never married, but had a son and a daughter. </p> <p>Luck abandoned him in 1995, when his horse stopped abruptly before a jump, throwing him head-first to the ground, his arms tangled in the reins, and severing his spinal cord from his skull. For a brief period afterwards, he has said, he was suicidal. \"Maybe we should let me go,\" he recalled telling his wife, Dana Morosini, but that state of mind proved short-lived; within the year his determination was growing, and so was his anger. </p> <p>Opponents of stem cell research say therapeutic cloning could lead easily to reproductive cloning, but Reeve had little time for that argument. \"We often hear about the slippery slope,\" he told this newspaper in February. \"But here in the US, when we lowered the voting age from 21 to 18, it didn't slide down to 12. It stopped at 18.\" Before Ronald Reagan's death earlier this year, Nancy Reagan communicated her own support for government-funded stem cell research to the New York Times; additional backing from several Republican members of Congress has made things even more difficult for Bush. The president argues that his support for research on existing stem cell lines is a compromise position, but the scientific consensus is that the existing lines are too contaminated to be useful. In recent years, Reeve had changed tactics, seeking to persuade individual US states to pass laws regardless of White House policy. </p> <p>In his last days, Reeve seemed to be accepting that his recovery might have reached a plateau. \"I'm in very good health, but it hasn't turned into an improvement in function that would really change my life,\" he told the BBC in a documentary that will be screened next week. The long-term effects of his life - and the timing of his death - on the future of spinal-cord research will remain unclear until at least after the forthcoming election. But he leaves one thing indisputable, which is that sometimes, the best form of pragmatism involves a dose of wild optimism. \"I have moments of anger,\" Reeve said at his New York home. \"But am I in despair about it? No, I'm not. Despair is a very bleak word.\"</p>",
  "<p>Superman is dead, but his work will live on. Christopher Reeve, who played Superman in the Hollywood version of the strip cartoon, will be remembered not just for his undoubted acting ability but also for the extraordinary courage and zest for life he displayed after being paralysed from the neck downwards in a riding accident in 1995 when his career was in full swing. He subsequently became a role model for disabled people in the way he refused to allow the condition to conquer his spirit as well as his body, and for the tireless way he campaigned on disability issues. </p> <p>He did not want or expect to die at the age of 52 but if his death gives a boost to stem cell research, for which he lobbied so enthusiastically, then he could have no more fitting a memorial. Stem cells taken from embryos (as opposed to adult stem cells) have the ability to develop into different types of tissue offering hope to sufferers from Mr Reeve's condition and numerous others, including incurable diseases such as muscular dystrophy, congestive heart disease and Alzheimer's. It is not pushing the metaphor too far to say that the fruits of such research may one day replicate in medicine the life-saving feats that Superman himself performed. </p> <p>Stem cell research on embryos is a controversial subject in the US. The Bush administration permits federal research funding into adult stem cells but has prohibited the use of such funds for embryonic stem cell research. The argument is thatit destroys human life, even though an early stage embryo (under 14 days old) is smaller than a pinhead. </p> <p>Last week, John Kerry, to his credit, stood by his earlier support for embryonic stem cell research despite the risk of alienating some religious groups in the last month of the presidential election campaign. Appropriately, he quoted Christopher Reeve, a friend of his, in support of his point of view. It is a tragedy that Mr Reeve has lost his life so young. The best bequest he could leave is that increased support for stem-cell research may one day lead to a cure for diseases that currently are lethal.</p>"
