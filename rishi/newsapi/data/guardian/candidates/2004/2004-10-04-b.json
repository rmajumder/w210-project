  "From the outside, the local community association on the west side of Chicago doesn't look much. The only sign on the shabby one-storey building is a piece of paper stuffed inside a clear plastic jacket on the front door. The building was supposed to be a temporary home but somehow years have gone by and the organisation is still there. <p>The South Austin coalition community council, run for 26 years by Bob Vondrasek, is in one of Chicago's grittiest neighbourhoods. It has taken on slum landlords, insurance companies, utilities firms, the board of education and the big banks over predatory lending policies. In recent months, though, the coalition and other community leaders in the city have confronted an opponent of an altogether different magnitude; Wal-Mart, the biggest company in the world, which is looking to open its first store within the city limits. </p> <p>Its plans have provoked an emotionally charged response from politicians, civic leaders and the church. Supporters argue that local people in the rundown neighbourhoods where it plans to open are in desperate need of cheap goods as well as jobs. Those against protest that Wal-Mart represents the very worst in American business and that it destroys small businesses and pushes down labour standards. The low prices, they argue, come at too high a cost. </p> <p>\"People ask why are we targeting Wal-Mart?\" says Vondrasek. \"The reason is because they are so influential and once you knock out the big bully the others tend to fall in line.\" </p> <p>At the last count, Wal-Mart employed 1.3 million workers in the United States. This month alone, it is opening 12 stores across the country. It also owns businesses in Europe and Japan, including Asda in Britain. </p> <p>Last year it had sales of $256bn, accounting for 2% of US gross domestic product. If it were an independent nation, Wal-Mart would be the eighth biggest trading partner with China. </p> <p>The ramifications of the company's spread have even made the presidential election campaign. John Kerry recently called its health care benefits \"disgraceful\". Consumer advocate Ralph Nader, running an independent campaign for the White House, described it as \"a cancer on the economy\". Vice-president Dick Cheney, however, praised Wal-Mart during a visit to its head office in Bentonville, Arkansas. </p> <p>The Chicago case is not isolated. Local resistance in Inglewood, California, earlier this year prevented Wal-Mart from opening there. Local groups are also preparing for battle in Washington DC as the company looks for its first location in the capital. </p> <p>The argument for Wal-Mart is compellingly simple - it creates jobs and provides low prices to consumers. Its store in Forest Park, just outside Chicago, is selling Wrangler jeans for $14.94 (\u00a38), a flat screen TV for $96.94 (\u00a355) and a microwave oven for $29.87 (\u00a316). Economists believe Wal-Mart has played a significant role in keeping US inflation down. </p> <p>On the west side of Chicago low prices and jobs are both welcome. The predominately black and Hispanic neighbourhood of Austin was once a vibrant manufacturing community but has fallen into decline as the factories have closed and the service industry moved out. The community wrestles with poverty and is rife with drugs and gangs. </p> <p>Wal-Mart had planned for two stores in the city; the other, in the equally rundown south, was blocked. It hired local public relations and legal firms, including the law firm of Michael Daley, the mayor's brother, and won approval for the Austin store only after heated hearings. </p> <p>Alderwoman Emma Mitts was a key supporter. \"All of my community pretty much wanted to have the Wal-Mart,\" she says. \"The low prices are good for my community. They help keep food on the table. Because Chicago is a union town, they say Wal-Mart shouldn't be here. That's what the fight was really about. Well, some job to me is better than no job at all.\" </p> <p>Opponents question the long-term impact of a Wal-Mart store. They quote numerous studies that claim to prove its deleterious effect. A report by the University of Illinois suggests the store on Chicago's west side would create 200 local jobs but lead to the loss of 265 jobs as smaller shops were forced to close. </p> <p>\"Any city that allows a Wal-Mart in under the guise of creating jobs and economic development should be wary,\" says Nik Theodore, director at the university's centre for urban economic development. \"A new store doesn't add new jobs - it is redistributing consumer spend and jobs from other local retailers.\" </p> <p>A recent report from the University of California claimed that the company's employees in the state received an annual $86m in public assistance including public health insurance and subsidised housing because they earned so little. \"We keep telling people, 'You are getting cheap product but you are having to subsidise this enormously profitable company in other ways,\" says James Thindwa at Jobs for Justice in Chicago, a nationwide organisation that campaigns for workers rights. \"There is a disconnect in people's minds.\" </p> <p>The irony that Wal-Mart is building on the site of a closed factory on the west side of Chicago is painfully clear to many local residents. \"Wal-Mart wraps itself in the American flag, but even the flags they sell are made in China,\" Thindwa says. \"It is complex. You look at an area where adults are on the corner unemployed and Wal-Mart is promising jobs. There is an immediacy about it, which is quite compelling until you start getting into the arguments.\" </p> <p>Wal-Mart's response to growing criticism has been a public relations blitz. It has been running advertising campaigns featuring female and ethnic minority workers talking about how great it is to work there. It is sponsoring public radio and set up bursaries for journalists. It has commissioned its own economic studies that claim it benefits the economy. It claimed that if Wal-Mart could take 20% of the market in Los Angeles, it would save shoppers $3.6bn and create 36,400 jobs. It recently announced that senior management bonuses would be tied to achieving certain diversity targets, to ensure the fair promotion of women and minorities. </p> <p>\"There is a lot of disinformation out there,\" says Wal-Mart community affairs manager Mia Masten. \"We offer competitive wages and benefits.\" There was no diktat ordering suppliers to shop for parts overseas - \"our mantra is everyday low prices and to achieve that we just want the best price possible from suppliers\"; the low percentage of workers covered by health benefits is due to the high number of \"seniors and students\" doing part-time work; and people already covered by their partner's health benefits from other companies. </p> <p>Opposition to the company continues to grow, however. The National Trust in the US has put the state of Vermont on its list of most endangered historic places because of plans to build more mammoth stores there. Its president, Richard Moe, says there are \"communities all over America whose downtowns have been devastated by the arrival of big-box retailers\". </p> <p>Campaigners are preparing a national plan to engage Wal-Mart. Community groups in Chicago put together a series of demands to put to the company, including guarantees that it would pay a living wage, not take public subsidy, allow unions and use local contractors to build the store. They had hoped the local council would present them to Wal-Mart before granting approval, but it didn't. The hope now is for ongoing hearings into a similar \"big box ordinance\" that could yet derail Wal-Mart's plans. It would force guarantees from stores over 75,000 square feet including a minimum wage of $10.50 (\u00a36) an hour, $3 (\u00a31.70) an hour in benefits and freedom of speech. </p> <p>\"I think we all feel good that a tremendous amount of awareness has been created about Wal-Mart,\" Vondrasek says. \"We're not telling people not to shop there, but let's push them to be better corporate citizens.\" </p> <p>For every victory, though, there continue to be other defeats. People living in Contra Costa County in the San Francisco Bay area recently voted to repeal a council-passed rule banning the construction of \"big-box\" stores. Wal-Mart is planning to build 40 stores in California. </p> <p>The difficulty unions face is overcoming the short-term fix for poor urban areas that Wal-Mart appears to promise with what is essentially a macro-economic argument. \"Its strategy is to take the path of least resistance,\" Theodore says. \"It targets African-American neighbourhoods. The west side of Chicago has been hard hit by plant closures and you reach a point where you start to take it personally. It's a community that feels the growth elsewhere in the city has passed them by and it's kind of unfair for that community to be told 'no' again.\"</p>",
  "Cobbled and quaint, Louisburg Square perches on fashionable and flush Beacon Hill, home to Boston's elite. In one corner stands a mansion as stately, tall and imposing as its owner, Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry. <p>If you are looking for clues to why Mr Kerry's campaign has struggled and why he should not be counted out yet, there are few better places to start than his own front door. </p> <p>Twice in the last eight years - in his 1996 senatorial bid and last year before the Democratic primaries - he has had to borrow hundreds of thousands of dollars against this prime piece of real estate to inject cash into flagging campaigns. Both times he started as favourite, dropped behind and then clinched victory with a late spurt. </p> <p>Outside the house is a space where a fire hydrant used to be. In 1997, after his wife, Teresa, racked up huge parking fines for blocking the hydrant, they had it moved, prompting citywide fury. </p> <p>\"You're talking about two of the most sensitive issues in the city,\" says Susan Orlean, a New Yorker writer who lives in Boston. \"Parking and anything to do with the fire department, which is revered only second to the church. It could only have been worse if she'd asked a priest to bless it.\" </p> <p>\"The whole incident resonated as a sense of their entitlement and arrogance,\" says Jon Keller, political analyst for the local television station, WB56. \"He's the least liked political figure in the state. Nobody around here has ever warmed up to him.\" </p> <p>President George Bush once said: \"I would say people, if they want to understand me, need to understand Midland [Texas].\" If you want to know Mr Kerry, you need to know Boston. </p> <p>And in the 2,147 miles and huge cultural and political gulf between Boston and Midland lies a large swath of the swing states that will decide which of these two men will have to win if they are going to become president. That is the journey I am making to gauge the mood of Middle America. </p> <p>\"The America I live in is the America of the cities,\" said New York-based intellectual Susan Sontag. \"The rest is just drive through.\" So, with petrol at just over \u00a31 a gallon making front page news, I am driving through. Heading from New England, over the Alleghenies, into the Midwest, around the Ozarks and into the heart of Tex-Mex, in the run up to what pollster John Zogby has termed the Armageddon election: \"Each side predicts the end is near if the other side wins.\" </p> <p>Boston is punctuated with evidence of Kerry's character, caste and past. There are the toilets of the plush Copley Plaza hotel where his grandfather went shortly before lunchtime on November 23 1912 and shot himself in the head after losing his third fortune; the Klivert and Forbes cookie stand in Quincy market, set up by Mr Kerry and his socialite friend, Dun Gifford, using their mothers' maiden names and secret recipes; and the North Station where Mr Kerry joined 100,000 other Bostonians on November 7 1960 to greet John Kennedy as he went to deliver his last speech before the 1960 election. </p> <p>But none of that emotional energy and enthusiasm, with which Boston embraced Kennedy, is evident today. Go to Hope, Arkansas (ancestral home of Bill Clinton) in 1992, or Russell, Kansas, in 1996 where the huge grain silo announced \"Home of Bob Dole\" (the Republican candidate of that year), and you could witness the civic pride borne from a native son who had become a presidential contender. </p> <p>Come to Boston now, however, and you are struck by the blend of ennui and indifference that the local boy is up for the big prize. </p> <p>As a three-term senator who has won the Democratic nomination they clearly respect him. \"He's been elected and then reelected, so he obviously must be doing something right,\" says Mr Keller. \"He's a smart liberal in a state with a lot of smart liberals.\" </p> <p>The trouble is they don't really like him. \"The main thing I like about John Kerry is that he's not George Bush,\" says Jo-Anne Granger, a retired schoolteacher, who lives in the Boston area. \"He hasn't always done things the right way but he's thoughtful and very bright and I was impressed by the things he said when he came back from Vietnam.\" </p> <p>But in a city that is both clannish and clubby, he remains an outsider in almost every sense. This is not entirely his fault. He did not grow up in Boston. Thanks to his diplomat father, he went to private school in Switzerland and then to St Paul's prep school in New Hampshire. </p> <p>In 2001, at a testimonial for the late Congressman Joe Moakley, who represented a tight-knit community in South Boston, Mr Kerry said: \"I felt a pang as I listened to him talk about the lessons learned in that community. Because one of my regrets is that I didn't share that kind of neighbourhood ... We moved around a lot.\" </p> <p>Despite his high birth he did not inherit great means, which placed him outside the Boston upper class crowd. And his senatorial career has been dwarfed by the dynastic reputation and bold style of Edward Kennedy, who has been representing Massachusetts in the senate for more than 40 years. \"It's like living in the shadow of the Hapsburgs in Vienna,\" says Richard Parker, a lecturer in public policy at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. </p> <p>\"The one thing he did have in his favour was that everyone thought he was Irish,\" says Mr Parker. That was dashed last year when Mr Kerry learned from reporters that his grandfather's real name was Fritz Kohn, an Austrian Jew who changed it to avoid anti-semitism. He picked Kerry by sticking a pin in a map. </p> <p>In the US, this is not necessarily a problem. Mr Bush has refashioned himself from a north eastern blueblood to a Texan everyman. With few established roots, Mr Kerry has also had to craft his own narrative as he goes along. </p> <p>The trouble is that few people in Boston know what he has reinvented himself as, and very few of those who think they do understand actually like it. Mr Bush is a brush cutter; Mr Kerry a windsurfer. A poll this year revealed that while most would rather have Mr Kerry teach their children, they would prefer Mr Bush at their barbecue. In presidential elections, these perceptions count. \"I know those things shouldn't matter, but they really do,\" says Melissa Enright, who lives in the city's Brookline area. \"This is someone you're stuck with for the next four years and you want to feel good about it.\" </p> <p>\"He's not their boy in the way Ted Kennedy is,\" says Ms Orlean. \"Politics here is very in-bred, and he's a solitary figure with the determination of leadership and without any of the human instincts to connect to people.\" </p> <p>Indeed, for the rest of America, Boston, Massachusetts, represents not just a city in a state but a cluster of cultural and political symbols in much the same way as Islington and Hampstead do in Britain. On his first trip to China, former secretary of state James Baker was asked whether he had been to a communist country before. No, he replied, only Massachusetts. </p> <p>This is the stuff of caricature. The last four Massachusetts governors have been Republicans, and the current one, Mitt Romney, is a Mormon. And while Boston may have its fair share of Brahmins, it is primarily a gritty, working class city where African Americans, Hispanics and Asians outnumber whites. </p> <p>But the caricature works. Bush's father pinned the \"Massachusetts liberal\" label on his Democratic challenger, Michael Dukakis, a former governor of the state, in 1988 to great effect. Now his son's team are out to do the same thing. </p> <p>Mr Kerry is used to be being lampooned. Derided as \"gorgeous preppie\" by leftwing cartoonist Doonesbury, he was branded \"a phoney\" by ex-president Richard Nixon on previously classified tapes and taunted as \"Live shot\" around Boston for always hogging the cameras. </p> <p>Back in 1972, shortly after Mr Kerry's anti-Vietnam protests had made him a national figure, such attacks helped to derail his bid to represent the mainly blue collar constituency of Lowell. </p> <p>\"People here saw him as a carpetbagger and an opportunist back then,\" says Kendall Wallace, who covered the campaign for the Lowell Sun at the time. And in troubling echoes of the current race Lowell adds: \"And when he was attacked he didn't fight back.\" Mr Kerry went from a 54% to 21% lead in the polls to defeat. It was the last election he would ever lose. </p> <p>In 1982 he was elected Massachusetts lieutenant governor and in 1984 he entered the Senate. His stiff, aloof manner almost lost him the seat in 1996 against the garrulous blueblood Republican, William Weld, who led Mr Kerry in the polls up to 10 days before voting day. The same thing happened in January, when two weeks before the caucuses in Iowa he was all but written off. \"I'm a good closer,\" says Mr Kerry. </p> <p>The question is: can he do it again? \"A lot of people want to see a pattern here but those cases were very specific,\" says Mr Parker. \"You're left wondering whether this is his eighth life or if he has used up all nine.\" </p> <p>\"People are hard wired differently and John doesn't seem to really focus until the final stages of the campaign,\" says Robert Reich, former secretary of labour in the Clinton administration and a lecturer at Brandeis university, who has known Mr Kerry for 25 years. \"But I don't know that he has been in a race where the opponent will do almost anything and say almost anything to win. The issue now is, when faced with this kind of opponent, how ruthless can Kerry be?\" </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Next stop: Derry, New Hampshire</p>",
  "The United Nations organisers of Afghanistan's first democratic presidential election admitted at the weekend that they expect next Saturday's polling to be be marred by fraud, intimidation and violence. <p>David Avery, chief of operations for the joint electoral management body, predicted that with more than 100,000 staff who had not seen an election before, it \"will not look pretty\".</p> <p>But he insisted that the irregularities would not be enough to deny the election legitimacy, or affect the final outcome.</p> <p>\"Not every box is going to make it? That is probably true. In the end, you count what you have got,\" he said at his headquarters in Kabul, heavily fortified against the threat of attack by the Taliban and al-Qaida.</p> <p>The Taliban have posted \"night letters\" - overnight posters - on mosque and other walls in southern Afghanistan threatening retribution against anyone taking part.</p> <p>Aid and other international organisations have reduced their staff and operations for the election campaign period; the US and other Nato countries have sent in reinforcements, increased patrols and arrested suspects.</p> <p>Although there have been intelligence reports of hundreds of Taliban fighters moving about the country, the election has so far been relatively quiet.</p> <p>The transitional president, Hamid Karzai, who is expected to win, has seldom been seen outside his compound in Kabul since coming under fire on a helicopter trip to Gardez on September 16.</p> <p>The other 17 candidates include warlords with long records of human rights abuses, a solitary woman and a poet. The latter, probably the most liberal, is Latif Pedram.</p> <p>His movements too have been hampered by death threats.</p> <p>\"I can no longer enter Seelo and Baghbal [two Kabul districts] after a warlord delegated 20 men to kill me on sight,\" he said.</p> <p>A kidnapping threat forced him to cut short a visit to his home province.</p> <p>One of his main offences was to advocate that women should enjoy the same right to divorce as men.</p> <p>Another candidate, Professor Satar Sirrat, who is threatening to boycott the election as unconstitutional, accused Mr Karzai of misspending the $3bn donated so far from the international community for reconstruction.</p> <p>\"The only visible project is the road from Kabul to Kandahar,\" he said. \"You could have built a road of silk with this kind of money.\"</p> <p>As well as coping with the Taliban and the warlords, the election organisers have to ensure that 22,000 polling stations are working on the day in a country with little infrastructure and communications: the ballot box at one polling station in the Hindu Kush will take two weeks to deliver to the counting post, by donkey.</p> <p>Mr Avery, an Australian who has been involved in postwar elections in Cambodia, Sierra Leone and East Timor, regards Afghanistan as his toughest yet.</p> <p>He has hired 5,000 mobile phones, 1,150 Russian jeeps, 300 donkeys, and 114,000 local staff. </p> <p>There will be a polling station in every district except Mandol, in Nuristan, which even by Afghan standards is thought extremely dangerous.</p> <p>\"No one goes there. Not even the Taliban,\" Mr Avery said.</p> <p>He has smuggled election material into some of the most hostile areas in the gaudily painted traditional trucks seen all over this part of Asia.</p> <p>Each had a strip painted on the roof so that they could be tracked from the air.</p> <p>The UN estimated that 9.5 million people were eligible to vote, but 10.5 million have registered, suggesting multiple registration.</p> <p>Those voting will have a finger marked in indelible ink to try to prevent a second visit to the polling station.</p> <p>Telibert Luoc, the senior programme officer with the National Democratic Institute, which is responsible for monitoring, has had problems finding international monitors because of the insecurity.</p> <p>He has found only 385, most of them recruited from the embassies.</p> <p>Unusually, there will be no monitors' report.</p> <p>Although concerned about Taliban attacks on election day, Afghans appear intent on enjoying the novelty of voting.</p> <p>Zahal Mahbuby, 20, a social science student sitting in the shade of the campus at the University of Afghanistan in Kabul, said: \"We have a lot of fear the Taliban will attack. We expect them to attack.\"</p> <p>She said she would vote for Mr Karzai because, she said, she regarded him as honest.</p> <p>She is rare in that she does not intend to vote on ethnic lines: a Tajik, she was prepared to vote for a Pashtun.</p> <p>Although it will take two weeks to collect all the ballots, the organisers will count the votes as they come in and they expect that the trend will be obvious within a few days of the election.</p>",

  "<p><strong>PLACE YOUR BETS NOW</strong></p> <p>The last time the Fiver saw TV's John McCririck in the flesh his hands were waving around like a pill-popping raver. Wave! Blur! Confusion! Old Man Smell! Still, at least we could be sure of one thing: judging by his tatty jacket, badger-bushy sideburns and his reaction to the 2.20pm novice chase at Wincanton, the Channel 4 racing pundit wasn't about to dip into a secret multi-million dollar treasure chest and purchase Manchester United.</p> <p>However the Fiver can't be so confident about McCririck's US doppelganger, billionaire businessman Malcolm Glazer - the man who's now odds-on favourite in the ongoing Manchester United Ownership Stakes. Today, United announced that it had received a preliminary approach regarding a takeover and, although they're not saying who, the smart money is that Glazer - who already owns 19.2% of the club - is sniffing around like a Collymore in the bushes.</p> <p>\"The approach contains a number of significant conditions,\" a statement released to the Stock Exchange droned like an early Zeppelin. \"The company is seeking clarification of this proposal and at this stage it is unclear whether any offer will be made.\" And that's not the only obstacle - Glazer would probably have to borrow to buy out United's leading shareholders JP McManus and John Magnier, who own a whopping 29% of the club.</p> <p>But if the deal does go ahead, United fans fear the worst. Glazer is the man, after all, who owns Tampa Bay Buccaneers - the team with the most expensive ticket prices in the NFL. And, seeing as he's 75, he's bound to want a return on his investment sharpish. Rooney to Madrid for \u00a360m, anyone?

  "Alexander Kwasniewski, the Polish president, today said the country had set no date for withdrawing its troops from Iraq despite comments from the defence minister that they should leave by the end of 2005. <p>He told reporters it might be possible \"to finish our mission\" by then, but stressed that discussions on Poland's role in Iraq were continuing.</p> <p>The defence minister, Jerzy Szmajdzinski, told the Gazeta Wyborcza newspaper in an interview published today that the troop withdrawal should coincide with the expiry, at the end of 2005, of a UN security council resolution endorsing Iraq's current interim government.</p> <p>So far 17 Poles have died in Iraq and opinion polls show nearly 75% of the public opposing troop deployment there. An opposition party, the Polish Peasants' party, has launched a petition seeking an immediate withdrawal.</p> <p>The prime minister, Marek Belka, said he had not authorised Mr Szmajdzinski to make such a statement, which departed from Warsaw's long-standing position that troops would remain in Iraq for \"as long as it takes\" to complete their mission.</p> <p>Mr Szmajdzinski argued that two and a half years in Iraq would be \"enough\" for a former Warsaw Pact army still \"reaching new capabilities and introducing new equipment\", but later said his remarks were his personal opinion and not the official position of the government.</p> <p>Poland last year took command of a multinational security force in central Iraq that currently includes about 6,000 troops, among them more than 2,400 Polish soldiers. </p> <p>Leaders have previously said they hope to scale down the Polish presence significantly after parliamentary elections in Iraq, scheduled for January.</p> <p>In last week's US presidential debate with the Democrat challenger, John Kerry, George Bush named Mr Kwasniewski as a key US ally in Iraq, alongside Tony Blair. </p> <p>In an interview with TVN24 television, Mr Szmajdzinski said his remarks were a \"counter-attack against demagogues, populists and irresponsible people\" who take political advantage of Poland's presence in Iraq. </p> <p>\"I don't want cheap populism to dominate in Poland, with the presence of our troops in Iraq used in political games,\" he said.</p>",
  "Peter Mandelson, Britain's candidate to become the EU's new trade commissioner, today told MEPs that he had moved on from Westminster politics and was fully committed to the commission. <p>The former trade and industry secretary, widely regarded as the architect of Labour's 1997 election victory, said he would be a \"dedicated team player\".</p> <p>His comments came as he faced questions about his suitability to hold a powerful brief that will see him negotiate international agreements on behalf of 25 countries.</p> <p>\"I have moved on from being a British parliamentarian. I have moved on from being the supporter, in the active day to day sense, of Tony Blair,\" he said.</p> <p>Mr Mandelson - who began his speech in French - said he had always been pro-European, and did not share the \"half-in, half-out attitude to the EU of some in Britain\".</p> <p>He said he would campaign for ratification of the EU constitution in the UK by giving a sceptical public the \"real arguments\" about Europe, but that his main goal was to complete talks on a new world trade deal in 2006. </p> <p>Success hinged on the US joining the EU in ending export subsidies on farm products and the cutting of import duties worldwide, he said, adding that the intention was to offer the world's poorest countries a chance to benefit from trade and access to key markets.</p> <p>\"In our proposals to eliminate export subsidies, we look for that to be matched by other countries, notably the United States,\" Mr Mandelson told MEPs. \"If it's not matched, the benefits for developing countries will be significantly reduced.\"</p> <p>He said that building better trade ties with Washington, and forging stronger links with China and other Asian economic powerhouses, would also be at the top of his agenda.</p> <p>Mr Mandelson will have to handle such sensitive issues as the latest EU-US trade disagreement over subsidies for rival aircraft makers Boeing and Airbus.</p> <p>He said he would take a balanced approach to trade relations, sticking to outgoing trade commissioner Pascal Lamy's policy of favouring multilateral deals over bilateral ones, and backing the Geneva-based World Trade Organisation.</p> <p>It is unlikely that the European parliament will block his appointment. Under EU rules, the EU assembly can only reject the entire new 25-member executive of the incoming commission president, Jose Manuel Barroso, and not individual members.</p> <p>A vote on the new commission will be held at the end of October, and it will take office on November 1.</p>",
  "<p>More than 60 million viewers tuned into the live television debate between George Bush and his Democrat rival John Kerry - double the number that watched the head to head between President Bush and Al Gore four years ago.</p> <p>At least 62.5 million watched the first of three live broadcasts, which saw Mr Kerry overturn the 8% lead of his rival, according to weekend polls.</p> <p>The keenly contested debate drew higher ratings than either of the two parties' summer conventions and attracted more than twice the 36 million average TV audience for the two 1996 encounters between then-president Bill Clinton and Robert Dole.</p> <p>Though Mr Bush and Mr Kerry could not match the record 80.6 million who watched Jimmy Carter take on Ronald Reagan, they still drew over 15 million more than the final episode of Friends in May.</p> <p>NBC drew the biggest single audience of the night when 17.2 million viewers tuned into its coverage of the 90-minute special. CBS, meanwhile, drew 13.5 million while ABC trailed with 11.5 million.</p> <p>Despite assurances that the networks would not cut between the two contestants, showing the glimpses of emotion and nervousness that have cost previous candidates dearly, the use of pull-back shots allowed broadcasters to show reactions, helping to keep audiences hooked. </p> <p>The live debate also drew large audiences on US cable channels. Fox News, which is notorious for its unconditional support for Mr Bush and his decision to invade Iraq, attracted 9.5 million viewers.</p> <p>The rightwing news channel was the fourth most-watched among campaign viewers, ahead of its sister network Fox Broadcasting, which managed 5.2 million viewers.

  "<p>Fox News, the influential rightwing US television network, said yesterday it had \"reprimanded\" its chief politi cal correspondent after its website carried fabricated quotes attributed to John Kerry, in which he called himself a \"metrosexual\" who enjoys getting manicures. </p> <p>The network, owned by Ru pert Murdoch, apologised for the article in which the Democratic challenger was quoted telling a rally in Florida: \"Didn't my nails and cuticles look great? What a good debate!\" Comparing himself to the president, Mr Kerry was supposed to have said: \"I'm metrosexual - he's a cowboy.\" Women voters, he purportedly added, \"should like me! I do manicures.\"</p> <p>The article appeared under the byline of Carl Cameron, who has been following Mr Kerry on the campaign trail. It had been posted on the site, the network said in a statement, because of \"fatigue and bad judgment, rather than malice.\"</p> <p>\"Carl Cameron made a stupid mistake and he has been reprimanded for his lapse in judgment. It was a poor attempt at humour and he regrets it,\" a Fox spokesman, Paul Schur, told the Los Angeles Times, though he would not give details of what action would be taken against Mr Cameron.</p> <p>The \"metrosexual\" story taps into a persistent theme underlying the election race, in which the Republican party and its supporters in the media have sought to make a campaign issue of the candidates' perceived masculinity.</p> <p>At the party's convention in New York last month, California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger called Mr Kerry's advisers \"economic girlie-men\".</p> <p>A metrosexual, the fake Fox article helpfully concluded, \"is defined as an urbane male with a strong aesthetic sense who spends a great deal of time and money on his appearance and lifestyle\".</p>",
  "The lawyer John Watkinson, who has died of cancer aged 63, was known less as a low-profile Labour MP for rural Gloucestershire West (1974-79) than as a Labour politician who defected to the Social Democratic party, from 1981. <p>Watkinson was born in Bristol and educated at Bristol grammar school and Worcester College, Oxford, where he read PPE. He used a seven-year stint teaching at Rugby school, where he was a champion at amateur Rugby fives, to study for the bar, to which he was called in 1971, practising on the Midland circuit.</p> <p>By then he had already been blooded in his first unsuccessful parliamentary contest at the hopelessly Conservative seat of Warwick and Leamington in 1970, losing to Dudley Smith by 15,639 votes. However, he made the grade in Gloucestershire West in the October 1974 general election by the thin majority of 409 votes, beating the Conservative candidate, Paul Marland, later to marry Caroline Marland, a former managing director of Guardian Newspapers Ltd.</p> <p>Although a good constituency MP, Watkinson made the mistake of taking minor parliamentary jobs. He was parliamentary private secretary at the home office, first to Roy Jenkins and then Merlyn Rees. He was also rapporteur on human rights in the council of Europe and the Western European Union. These posts provided few headlines in constituency newspapers. The Thatcher tide in the 1979 general election replaced him by Marland, and Watkinson went to work for BBC TV as a financial reporter.</p> <p>He reappeared in the political world in 1981 when more than 40 Labour MPs and ex-MPs publicly defected to the SDP under the leadership of the Gang of Four. Like most of the others, Watkinson was pro-European and critical of the leftwing postures and union domination of Michael Foot's Labour party, and, although he twice carried the flag for the SDP in Gloucestershire West, in 1983 and 1987, he did not seriously threaten Marland's hold. </p> <p>He returned to the law, becoming a solicitor in 1986, and also a director of a Chepstow firm, Interconnect Communications. From 1992 he became a specialist adviser on telecommunications to a score of newly emerging countries, largely on the basis of his 1987 book, UK Telecommunications Manual.</p> <p>He is survived by his wife Jane, two sons and two daughters.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> John Taylor Watkinson, lawyer, politician and telecommunications specialist, born January 25 1941; died September 21 2004</p>",
  "Televised debates rarely decide an election, but last Thursday's was a turning point in this one. It arrested the malaise that had settled around John Kerry's campaign, and punctured the aura of inevitable victory that had begun to enshroud the George Bush camp. <p>As surprisingly substantive as this 90-minute debate was, what made it a decisive win for Kerry was not any specific policy argument, but an overall impression that Bush is disconnected from reality.</p> <p>As with all televised debates, this impression was primarily created by cosmetics and a maximum of two or three phrases that stuck in viewers' minds. Those became oft-repeated soundbites, solidifying initial perceptions.</p> <p>A hitherto loquacious Kerry finally edited himself, delivering zingers that stayed with people. \"You can be certain and wrong\" and \"Saddam Hussein didn't attack us, Osama bin Laden attacked us\" were two of the most memorable lines of the evening.</p> <p>But one thing Bush said made the most lasting impression and, faithful to his message discipline, he repeated it over and over: \"Wrong war, wrong time, wrong place.\"</p> <p>He used the phrase to try to reinforce his contention that Kerry is unfit for the highest office because he questions the prosecution of the war in Iraq. Unfortunately for Bush, this line - rather than helping him underline the flip-flop argument against Kerry - powerfully made an essential argument for the challenger. </p> <p>\"Wrong war, wrong time, wrong place\" had been the Kerry soundbite that dared not speak its name, thought to be too strident for a candidate trying to exploit disenchantment over Iraq without appearing to be unpatriotic. </p> <p>Kerry finally stated the obvious - if not as pithily - as he saw his poll numbers eroding last month. It's deeply ironic that Bush finally nailed the phrasing. </p> <p>The mantra revealed to the American people, perhaps for the first time, the extent of the president's arrogance. Bush was assuming that the viewing public, and particularly swing voters, agree with him that Iraq is the right war at the right time in the right place - a huge leap of faith that could only be based on hubris. </p> <p>The reality is that even lifelong Republicans are deeply uneasy about a war that seemingly has no end, and in which more and more US personnel are dying each month. </p> <p>The assumption that most voters are unerringly behind his war was a colossal lapse of judgment on the part of the president - almost on a par with the decision to go to war in the first place. It could yet be his undoing.</p> <p>The visual grammar of the debate was at least as important as what was said. The moment that a relaxed John Kerry entered stage right, leaned in and took George Bush's hand in his made a significant statement. </p> <p>The 5in height advantage the challenger enjoys over the incumbent transmitted a sense that not only is Kerry up to executive office, but that maybe the current occupier of the White House does not quite fill the top job's shoes.</p> <p>In the side by side shot, the frame around Bush's podium artificially lifted him to place him evenly alongside Kerry. It gave him a distorted, slightly weird look, only accentuating his height disadvantage. Bush was hunched, while Kerry stood ramrod straight. Side by side, one looked like a president, the other like a hassled software salesman. </p> <p>Had the TV networks not flouted the absurd debate rule outlawing cutaway shots, we would never have seen Bush's petulant reaction to much of what Kerry had to say. </p> <p>At times, it seemed as though he was simply irritated by the inconvenience of having to submit himself to this ritual of democracy, and his mute imperiousness - reminiscent of the air given off by his watch-glancing father in the Clinton debate - was much more revealing than any of the over-rehearsed gobbits of what he said. </p> <p>Bush inexplicably fell into the same too much make-up trap as Al Gore in 2000. Over-hued, he looked almost radioactive under studio lights, while Kerry looked much more natural. </p> <p>Powder cake makeup is a vestige from the dawn of the television era - modern lighting does not require it. Bad make-up is not a sin by itself but, together with all the other cosmetic impressions, it contributed to this idea of a chief executive who is out of touch.</p> <p>What helped Kerry most of all, of course, was that he had so handily won the battle of low expectations going into this first face-off. In the preceding week, he appeared to be so dead in the water that his solid performance looked stunning. </p> <p>Had the campaign not looked in such terminal freefall ten days ago, you might suspect it was a conscious strategy. In politics, what a difference a day makes.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Philip James is a former senior Democratic party strategist</p>",
  "John Kerry has erased George Bush's lead among American voters, nudging just ahead of the president, according to the first major poll conducted since last Thursday's debate. <p>Instant surveys in the hours after the candidates met in Miami showed a widespread perception that Mr Kerry's had been the winning performance - but the <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6159637/site/newsweek/\"> Newsweek poll</a>, released yesterday, suggests that he has solidified this into a 47%-45% lead among registered voters. </p> <p>Because of the margin of error, the result essentially portrays the race as a dead heat. </p> <p>The Democratic challenger's two-point lead is a turnaround from the 11-point lead Newsweek gave Mr Bush in the aftermath of the Republican national convention in New York - an edge that had appeared to stabilise into a six-point lead for the president in a poll by the same organisation two weeks ago. </p> <p>It is the first sign that Mr Kerry's assured performance at the debate may help him in the voting booth against Mr Bush, whose irritated frowns during his opponent's responses have been played often on US TV networks in the last three days. </p> <p>Newsweek also found Mr Kerry's favourability rating rising to 52% and Mr Bush's falling to 49%, the first time it has dropped below the halfway mark since July. </p> <p>Mr Kerry, frequently portrayed as aloof and patrician, even came across as more likeable, the poll found, leading Mr Bush 47%-41%. </p> <p>But one Newsweek result that may worry the Kerry campaign suggests a sense of inevitability among the electorate: 55% of voters believe Mr Bush will be re-elected, while only 29% think he will not.</p>",
  "Welcome to the Wrap, Guardian Unlimited's round-up of the best of the day's papers. <p><b>TORIES HAVE 'NEVER BEEN IN SUCH DESPAIR'</b></p> <p>The phone calls a convalescing Tony Blair is reported to have made to newspaper editors over the weekend appear to have done the trick. The Blair-Brown rift is off the front pages - with the exception of the FT, which runs a tactful \"Brown leads call for unity\" splash.</p> <p>Mr Blair may have been ailing, but the Tories - if the papers are to be believed - are on their deathbeds. \"The Conservative party is dying. Why would you want to give it the kiss of life?\" Robert Kilroy-Silk, who has now made his ambition to lead Ukip public, said at the Ukip conference over the weekend. \"What we have to do is to kill it and replace it.\" And the papers, it would seem, agree.</p> <p>\"Despite all the bad times the Conservative party has had in the last decade or so, it has never been in such despair as it is today,\" writes Simon Heffer in the Mail. \"Its challenge this week is not to convince anyone that it can win the next election - for that is a pipe dream - but to convince the millions fed up with Tony Blair and Labour that the Tory party can, at last, be an effective opposition.\"</p> <p>The Telegraph is more optimistic, begging the party to bite the bullet and pledge to cut taxes - something the Guardian predicts Michael Howard will do this week, although not as emphatically as the Telegraph would wish. The line, the Tories' co-chairman Liam Fox tells the Guardian, will be similar to Margaret Thatcher's in 1979 - no specific promises, but a \"very clear direction that the government intended to reduce taxes\".</p> <p>The Times' revelation that Michael Howard is even less popular than Iain Duncan Smith was will come as a blow to the party, as will a Populus poll putting Labour on 35% of the vote and the Conservatives seven points behind. There is further embarrassment in the Mirror: \"Nightclub boss Peter Stringfellow delighted a crowd of 200 young Tories when he shouted 'Die, Tony, die!' hours after the prime minister's heart operation,\" splashes the paper.</p> <p>\"Nihil desperandum\", consoles the Telegraph, which says it would be a \"profound error\" for Mr Howard to try to win back Ukip supporters by stealing the party's policies: \"Elections are won on the middle ground, not the extremes\".

Condoleezza Rice agreed in 2002 they were \"only really suitable for nuclear weapons programmes ...

  "It must have seemed like a terrific stroke of luck: Dick Cheney, the man who for the past five years had been the chief executive of Halliburton, became the vice-president in 2000. The oil services and engineering company was given a direct line to the White House. <p>But Halliburton's relationship with the Bush administration is beginning to prove more problematic than it is worth. </p> <p>The company admitted 10 days ago that it was considering selling Kellogg Brown &amp; Root (KBR), the division carrying out billions of dollars worth of work for the US government in Iraq, in a desperate attempt to get out of the spotlight. It is considering a sale, spin-off or a separate listing for the business on the stock exchange.</p> <p>The company's shares have fallen from $50 (\u00a328) when Mr Cheney first took office in the White House to the low $30s.</p> <p>Halliburton's business with the federal government has grown considerably since the current administration took office. According to the New York Times, the business went from being the 22nd biggest military contractor in 2000 to the seventh largest in 2003.</p> <p>Prior to the invasion of Iraq, without being asked to tender, Halliburton was handed a contract worth up to $7bn to repair the nation's oilfields. It was also given a contract to provide logistical support to US troops, handling everything from food to transport and laundry services. That deal, awarded under an existing long-term contract to provide emergency services, was worth a potential $13bn.</p> <p>When the first secretive contract came to light, shortly after the March 2003 invasion, Democrats rounded on the company, arguing that it was evidence of an old boy network in the White House. Mr Cheney, who walked away from Halliburton with a $36m package, continued to receive deferred income from the firm.</p> <p>The oilfields contract was eventually put out to tender, with KBR retaining part of the business. The higher profile of Halliburton has ensured that the company has remained on the front pages throughout a series of controversies that might otherwise have gone unreported.</p> <p>This year the firm agreed to pay $7.5m to settle allegations that it failed to disclose a key accounting change in 1998 that allowed it to inflate profits and meet Wall Street targets while Mr Cheney was still in charge. </p> <p>The accounting change, concerning the booking of disputed cost overruns on projects, allowed it to increase its profits by more than $200m. A class action lawsuit brought on behalf of shareholders has accused the firm of systemic accounting fraud - allegations the company denies.</p> <p>Investigations are still under way into claims that a consortium KBR now leads paid bribes to Nigerian officials to secure the contract to build a natural gas plant. The company has admitted uncovering discussions of bribes, though it has no evidence they were actually paid. A treasury department inquiry has also been reopened into dealings the company may have had with Iran.</p> <p>Military officials, meanwhile, have accused KBR of routinely overcharging for work carried out as part of its logistics contract in Iraq and threatened to withhold payment on 15% of bills. </p> <p>A Pentagon auditors' report said the company had failed to account for at least $1.8bn worth of work done. In a little-covered development the defence contract management agency said last month that the company's billing methods were adequate but that had no effect on the other investigations and audits still pending.</p> <p>The Pentagon is now considering breaking the contract up into six pieces and inviting new tenders. Tired of the onslaught of invective, Halliburton has said it is not certain if it will bid for any of the smaller pieces.</p> <p>In a meeting with investors in Houston toward the end of September, Halliburton's chief executive, David Lesar, said the company had become the target of a \"vicious campaign\" of political attacks ahead of the presidential election. The company's workers, he added, \"don't deserve to have their jobs threatened for political gain\". Another reason for wanting to quit Iraq is that 45 of the company's workers have died there.</p> <p>As the presidential election has heated up, so has the temperature surrounding Halliburton. The company has become a useful piece of shorthand for the newly aggressive democratic nominee, John Kerry.</p> <p>He told an audience in Albuquerque on a campaign trip last month: \"Dick Cheney's old company, Halliburton, has profited from the mess in Iraq at the expense of American troops and taxpayers. While Halliburton has been engaging in massive overcharging and wasteful practices under this no-bid contract, Dick Cheney has continued to receive compensation from his former company.\"</p> <p>In last week's presidential debate, the Democratic nominee assailed Halliburton again on national television. He said the administration had deliberately limited overseas participation in Iraqi reconstruction to save the \"spoils of war\" for the company.</p> <p>Mr Cheney, it turns out, may have been of little real help to Halliburton at all: KBR filed for bankruptcy earlier this year, weighed down by asbestos litigation it inherited from an acquisition the vice-president made while he was still running the firm.</p>",

  "If you're interested in who's going to be the next US president then forget the precedents. If history is anything to go by, both John Kerry and George Bush will win. No candidate who lost the popular vote but won the presidency (John Quincy Adams, 1824; Rutherford B Hayes 1876; Benjamin Harrison, 1888; George Bush, 2000) has ever been re-elected. But then no president has failed to be re-elected during a major war. <p>Since 1964, every incumbent with approval ratings below 50% in the spring of the year when they are running for re-election, which would include Bush, has lost. But then every incumbent who has had an approval rating above 50% at this stage, which would include Bush, has won. The truth is that nobody can predict the outcome of the presidential election. The polls are too volatile, the margins too close and the context in which they are being conducted too precarious. Anything from a large mortar attack in Iraq that kills several US soldiers (Iraqi casualties appear to have little impact on US public opinion) to a plant closure in Ohio could tip the balance either way. </p> <p>Kerry has started to bounce back, helped in part by a strong debate performance. But for now, Bush is the narrow favourite. That forces the rest of us to wrestle with the prospect of four more years of the most rightwing administration most can remember. What should the world make of America and Americans if Bush wins? </p> <p>In 2000, such a prospect was unpleasant but far less alarming. If anything, the world was more concerned by his unilateral withdrawal from the global arena (reneging on treaties like Kyoto) than his unilateral intervention into it. Moreover, the manner in which Bush assumed power - selected by judges rather than elected by people - denied him absolute legitimacy in the world's eyes and helped us differentiate him from the people he claimed to represent. </p> <p>This time things are different. Since September 11 2001, Americans have been forced to take a closer look at the world around them. Over the past two years they have seen their government prosecute an illegal war in a nation where they are unwelcome occupiers and flout the will of the UN, and their soldiers torture Iraqis in Abu Ghraib prison. In short, they have seen loathing for their country grow around the globe - even among those they once counted as allies - and more than a thousand of their countrymen killed in combat. If they lost their innocence on September 11 - never a particularly convincing assertion - then they cannot have it back now. </p> <p>If Bush wins fair and square on November 2, then what conclusions can we draw about a nation that consciously decides this is the course it wants to take? We might start by ruling out a few. First, it will not mean that Americans are stupid. They aren't. Compared with the rest of the world, they are pretty well educated and certainly no more stupid than Britons, French or Portuguese were when they had an empire. Nor will it mean they have been duped. They haven't. They have been lied to constantly and their mainstream media has served them poorly, particularly over weapons of mass destruction, the connection between al-Qaida and Saddam Hussein, and the Middle East. </p> <p>But in a nation where the internet is widely available, and films, books and radio stations present other opinions, Americans have had access to a wide range of viewpoints, including Howard Dean and Michael Moore. True, dissident voices have been marginalised. But they have not been extinguished - and, if anything, have grown more mainstream in the past year. So if Americans come away from the plurality of opinions with which they have been presented to back Bush, it will not be because they did not know that other views were out there, but because they chose to believe one set of views over others. </p> <p>The question is, why? Partly because they have not been presented with much of an electoral alternative. The choice, come November 2, is between a man who prosecuted the war and a man who voted for him to do so. Indeed, Kerry's polling numbers have only started climbing since he began putting a distance between himself and Bush on the war, as he did during the debate. </p> <p>The US is not exceptional in this regard. Across the western world people are facing unpalatable electoral choices. In the French presidential election run-off between Chirac and Le Pen, opponents of the incumbent urged voters to support \"the crook, not the fascist\". In Germany, recent regional elections show a huge increase in support for neo-Nazis and former communists, and a slump in backing for the two main parties. In Britain, we have Tony Blair or Michael Howard - two men who supported the war while most of the country did not. But given America's huge military capability and the administration's trigger-happy instincts, the stakes for the rest of the world - even with such a poor choice - are far higher than elsewhere. </p> <p>Then there is fear - Bush's invisible running mate. Republicans have explicitly claimed that the US will get hit again if Kerry wins. \"Weakness invites those who would do us harm,\" says one radio ad, broadcast last week in the swing states. The Democrats are now at it too. In the past few weeks, they have argued that a second Bush term could cause more casualties, another Vietnam in Iraq, a military draft, a secret call-up of reservists and even a nuclear attack against the US. </p> <p>More than anything else, though, a Bush victory would suggest that when given a choice between leading the world through force or through consensus (the notion that America should not lead the world has not arisen), most of those who expressed a preference preferred force. It will indicate a desire to preserve the nation's military, economic and diplomatic hegemony and the cheap oil and protected industries it brings. In short, given a choice between being powerful and being safe, the Americans will have chosen power. They will have decided that global supremacy is more important to them than being either liked or respected. </p> <p>But at the same time, it is important to remember that, given the relatively low turnouts and slim margins, a majority of those who expressed a preference will still be a minority of American people. The Bush agenda has also energised a huge section of the country which opposes him and that is every bit as vocal as those who back him </p> <p>The country is riven on almost every axis possible - between red states (for Bush) and blue states (for Kerry), between the religious and the secular, the metro and the retro. \"Not since the civil war has the country been so divided,\" argues John White, professor of politics at the Catholic University of America. Whether Bush wins or loses, these rifts will endure. America is not just a nation at war with the world; it is a nation at war with itself. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:g.younge@theguardian.com\">g.younge@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "The book to read between dozes in the Tory back stalls at Bournemouth this week is, curiously, a Labour one. Giles Radice started a diary in the dreadful aftermath of 1979 and toiled away at it zealously, in party sickness and party health, as shadow frontbencher, backbencher and peer. From disaster to triumph in 22 years, the longest of marches. And the Conservatives haven't even put their boots on yet. <p><a href=\"#diaries\">Diaries 1980-2001*</a> is full of anger and despair, the pure politics of a politician who has only one life to live and one career to make. He reels at the \"catastrophe\" of 1983. He asks himself the bitterest question after 1987: \"Will Labour ever be in government again?\" He is utterly cast down by 1992. </p> <p>There's a wonderful entry for May 5 1992, when he dines at the Ivy with Peter Jenkins (long of the Guardian, then of the Independent, and one of the great political sages). Giles has bet on a Labour victory, and lost: he's paying the bill. \"Peter says that Labour will never win and that the Tories will always be in power. He also says that I should leave politics and try to get a job in the European commission.\" </p> <p>Yet, of course, only one parliament later the Blair hegemony begins, the legacy of Thatcher (if not the Ivy's fishcakes) slides down the pan of history, and the world is utterly, utterly changed. Did anyone, 15 years ago, see PM Tony buying a \u00a33.6m pound pad in Connaught Square and pronouncing himself fit for another full term at the top? Did anyone see the ex-natural party of government winding up as also-also-also rans in Hartlepool? </p> <p>One virtue of reading Radice is that it is a tale of the totally unexpected. But it is also a tale of hard work and hard slog: that long march again. Time after time, confronting its own demons, Labour did what was necessary on policy and constitution and organisation. From Neil Kinnock on, it earned its return to power. John Smith brought new credibility. Tony Blair made his own luck. Even in defeat, there was progress. But the Tories, two elections later, have made no progress and earned nothing. Nobody will be staking an Ivy bread roll on them next May. </p> <p>Of course, some of the direr prognoses of doom in yesterday's heavy Sundays may be overdone. Of course, Robert Kilroy-Silk spins a tatty yarn when he asks his Ukip conference why anyone should wish to give the Conservative party the kiss of life. \"What we have to do is kill it off and replace it. That is our destiny, that is our opportunity.\" Nevertheless, it is time to carve a few notches in the greasiest of poles. </p> <p>Michael Howard, surveying episode 97 of Blair v Brown the other day, prophesied years of infighting over the leadership. Perhaps. But he needs to watch his own back. So far the Tory idea of renewal is simply to swap messiahs, from Major to Hague to Duncan Smith to Howard in four easy stumbles, rather as though you were choosing a new manager for West Bromwich Albion or a new editor for the Daily Express. What, then, becomes of him and his leadership after the next defeat? </p> <p>Next May, Howard will be only a few weeks from his 64th birthday. Four or five years later - that full term Tony keeps talking about - he will be knocking at No 70's door. He will, in short, be gone, a memory, another footnote to central office history, replaced by a Rifkind, Cameron, Green, Fox or resurrected Hague. Or maybe by two or three of them in hapless succession, as the vortex of desperation deepens. After all, it's only 11 months since Howard took over. This is his first conference as leader, and already the voices at the back of the hall make it his last. </p> <p>The point about reading Radice is that, from moment to moment, he and Peter Jenkins could have been right. Labour could have subsided into wretched oblivion. There was no God-given entitlement for pendulums to swing. Success had to be grafted and fought for. </p> <p>But where can you find such staunchness of purpose at Bournemouth? Howard has no central policy thrusts to develop. Less taxes, more taxes or more of the same? Less spending, more spending or matched spending, pound for pound? Less Iraq involvement, more troop commitment or more of the same? Less Europe, more Europe or something unbelievable in between? </p> <p>It is a dismaying stew without definition or purpose - as contradictory as oozing care and consensus from one side of the mouth and snarling about immigration from the other, as inertly hopeless as losing Damian Green from your shadow team and returning John Redwood to glory. </p> <p>Howard arrives at the seaside as the only Tory leader since records began who isn't welcome to a Republican White House - but one who nevertheless preaches a kind of half-baked Bush conservatism learned from Conrad Black's Telegraph. Friendless and rootless, ideologically adrift - will he get the support of the Murdoch papers? Don't ask. They only back winners. </p> <p>Nothing is for ever, to be sure; 2009 could be a totally different fishcake. Ukip could have gone the self-destruct way of all prancing extremist groups. The Liberal Democrat challenge could have collapsed (as it did for Radice in 1987). G Brown could have taken a meat cleaver to his neighbour. But unless there is a course, set and steady, then there will be no tide to ride. Unless there's a fundamental choice on Europe - properly in or properly out, not temporising like John Kerry on Iraq - then Ukip is a rocky, wrecking headland. Welcome to Bournemouth: clouds heavy, sky grey going on black. And bring a good book. </p> <p><a name=\"diaries\">*Giles Radice's Diaries: 1980-2001, Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson</a></p> <p><a href=\"mailto:p.preston@theguardian.com\">p.preston@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "For those of us who still regard ourselves as Labour, Brighton in 2004 was the best party conference for years. It was not quite as good as it seemed in the heat and dust of the arena. The concessions to principle were less than they first appeared. Charles Clarke's promise to limit the specialist schools' right to select 10% of their pupils was only a recognition that most of them have already chosen to be genuinely comprehensive. But, like other modernisers, he chose to show respect to established values. <p>More important, so did the prime minister. For the first time since he came to office, Tony Blair did not use his Tuesday afternoon set-piece to distinguish and dissociate himself from the most strongly held beliefs of the party he leads. It was almost possible to hope that the \"progressive consensus\" - which Gordon Brown rightly argued is essential to the success of a radical government - stretches as far as 10 Downing Street. Labour's passion for unity, which Aneurin Bevan advised his enemies never to underestimate, was much in evidence last Thursday afternoon. There was a real disposition to forget old enmities and grievances. John Prescott's call to battle struck exactly the right note on which to send the delegates home. When they arrived, they discovered that Tony Blair had announced that, if Labour wins the next election, he will remain prime minister for the full term of the new parliament. </p> <p>After the initial surprise - not at the content of the message but its timing and method of delivery - sensible people realised that nothing much had changed. Perhaps when Tony Blair gave his undertaking to step down before the end of the year, John Prescott and Gordon Brown really believed that the tectonic plates had moved. But when Alan Milburn was appointed policy supremo, they must have realised that the promise would be broken. They both understand the Labour party. So they could not have accepted the nonsense about the prime minister remaining in office for another full parliament. </p> <p>Tony Blair will stay in No 10 for about two years of his third term. As he gradually becomes a greater liability, even the most supine members of the parliamentary party will put pressure on him to go. With any luck, he will have a historic achievement - membership of the European single currency or an end to the war in Iraq - to cheer him on his way. But the party will want a new leader in place by the time the 2005 parliament is half over. It will, of course, be Gordon Brown. </p> <p>What happened to the prime minister's media advisers last week? Did they accept the argument that the heart \"procedure\" combined with the purchase of the house in Connaught Square made an announcement essential to end the speculation? If so, all they achieved was increased speculation about the prime minister's character as well as his intentions. </p> <p>The announcement reminds us about two of Tony Blair's defining characteristics. The man who chose, on the evening his party conference ended, to announce his intentions on television, sees himself as a president, not as a party leader. He spoke as if his name would appear on every ballot paper. Although John Smith would certainly have won the 1997 election, Tony Blair added 50 or 60 seats to Labour's majority. But those days are over. </p> <p>It will be the party that wins or loses in 2005. One of the reasons why the prime minister's attraction has faded was illustrated by the other debilitating weakness which Thursday's performance confirmed. He has a near-fatal tendency to say what will get him through the day and let tomorrow look after itself. The worst example of that expediency was the claim that Saddam's WMDs could be activated in 45 minutes. That won him a parliamentary majority for war, but it will haunt him into history. Thursday's announcement provided a respite which did not even last the day. </p> <p>John Prescott - whose loyalty is greater than his judgment - thinks the party will now concentrate on winning the next election. Some people with ideas above their station will be diverted from that task by the vain hope of becoming prime minister. Who can really believe that Stephen Byers will abandon all hope of a Milburn premiership? And is John Reid capable of declaring a truce in his campaign to frustrate Gordon Brown's ambitions? They will both make speeches about unity. But that is not quite the same. </p> <p>All that being said, between now and polling day a process will develop which all social democrats should welcome. It is the party - the trade unions and the constituencies, with a little help from Labour MPs - who elect the leader. Tony Blair's announcement emancipated the membership. Alan Milburn, Charles Clarke and Peter Hain must all realise that their hope of preferment requires them to appeal to the rank and file. More competition and privatisation in the public services? Not if you want to be party leader. Unwittingly, Tony Blair has brought the party back to life.</p> <p><a href=\"comment@theguardian.com\">comment@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>To many female readers, the term women's weeklies still conjures up dreary images of practical teatime recipes and credibility-stretching true-life stories. But this traditionally most unglamorous of magazine sectors has been enjoying a quiet revolution of late, sealed by the announcement last week that Australian media tycoon Kerry Packer is launching a new venture with Britain's National Magazine Company dedicated to producing weekly women's titles. </p> <p>At a time when monthly magazine and newspaper sales are falling, consumer spending on weekly magazines has risen by almost 20% over the past three years, thanks to the unstoppable rise of celebrity magazines such as Heat and Now. </p> <p>But the star performer of the past year has been Emap's Closer, a new hybrid of the traditional weekly and the celebrity magazine that now averages more than 475,000 sales a week. </p> <p>Just a year after it launched, Closer already outsells the once dominant Woman's Own, and its combination of human interest and celebrity has appealed to new readers put off by the staid image of its older rivals such as Take a Break and Woman's Own. </p> <p>But Paul Thomas, press director at media buying agency MindShare, believes there is still room for growth in the women's weeklies market. </p> <p>\"The celebrity sector is enormous now but if you think about the traditional weeklies there's still a younger reader who's not buying them,\" he says. \"There is a market out there for a weekly magazine aimed at younger women and that's where we see the sector moving.\" </p> <p>No doubt Packer, rumoured to be looking at launching a UK version of the hugely successful (if confusingly titled) Australian weekly Women's Day, will be following its progress with interest.</p>",
  "<p>* Poor old Simon Cowell, and we never thought we'd say that. As if being sued by his old mate Simon Fuller wasn't bad enough, a gofer on The X-Factor has done thousands of pounds' worth of damage to his beloved Bentley. Word has it that a production assistant was asked to move the great man's car to make way for an outside broadcast truck, but the poor unfortunate's driving skills proved rather less impressive than Cowell's talent for spotting stars. Not so much the X-Factor as the XXXX-Factor. </p> <p>* Last week: On the morning of Ofcom's public service broadcasting announcement, the Financial Times tells readers it is going to propose the BBC licence fee might be top-sliced. It didn't. Last month: the FT says BBC Worldwide is going to be sold off. It isn't. Once was unfortunate, twice looks careless. Over at the BBC, director-general Mark Thompson, who is on record as saying the BBC is looking for partnerships, not flotation, is said to be very bemused. </p> <p>* As Fat Nation, BBC1's attempt to make us all eat less and exercise more, fails to grab the nation's imagination, Monkey's attention is drawn to the keep-fit facilities at the BBC itself. \"Pathetic discounts at gyms (mostly in London), BBC Club (again, nothing for the regions) and (in Broadcasting House at least), one solitary shower for the entire building, handily located in the men's loos,\" laments a letter in the inhouse rag, Ariel. A case of corporation, slim thyself. </p> <p>* Viewers may notice something familiar about Sky Sports' move into equestrianism when its Horse of the Year Show programme begins next week. The theme tune is identical to the BBC's old coverage, which drew healthy audiences in the 60s and 70s before being quietly dropped. Turns out that the rights were held not by the BBC but by the British Show Jumping Association, and Sky Sports boss Vic Wakeling jumped at the chance. Well, it was composed by Mozart. </p> <p>* Disturbing news of an unlikely rebuff for the good people of BBC1's Newsround. The kids' news programme sent a team to a Muslim school in London to find out what it was like growing up as a Muslim in Britain. \"We don't want your lot around here,\" they were told. \"Go away.\" What could they possibly have done? Turns out the school thought they were from the caring, sharing News of the World. Cue rapid fence-mending all round. </p> <p>* Books corner: Following its Monkey plug last week, sales of Greg Dyke's biography Inside Story have rocketed, shifting 2,000 copies last week alone and even outselling Graham Norton. There's no need to thank us Greg. No, really. </p> <p>* Unlikeliest political clash of the week was between Newsnight's Michael Crick and Liz Dawn, who plays Vera Duckworth in Coronation Street and turned out in support of Labour's Iain Wright at the Hartlepool by-election. Crick: \"Do you think Mr Wright will be an improvement on the previous MP?\" Dawn: \"I don't know ... You're trying to tie me up in knots.\" Crick: \"What does Peter Mandelson do in Brussels?\" Dawn: \"Go away, you're a boring prat.\" Not exactly up to Bush and Kerry standards, but close. </p> <p>* The author of the leaked Panorama document published here last week, it's since emerged, was Colin Savage, head of development. His unsurprising previous job? Current affairs chief at ailing yoof channel BBC3. </p> <p>* Somewhat belatedly, we bring you this from Today editor Kevin Marsh's letter to listeners, on BBC Europe correspondent Stephen Sackur. \"The Brussels crooner was ... seducing the microphone, dressed in one of those cotton and silk black polonecks and tightly cut 'slacks' with no pockets so that you have nowhere to put your loose change, and for that matter no room for anything much else loose, and though I don't want to appear to dwell on this aspect, there really are some trouser-related bits and bobs that you simply don't want to see in profile like that, especially not lit by the low sun of a late August sunrise, which can produce such scarily elongated shadows.\" Time for a lie down in a darkened room? </p> <p>* Forget Dyke and Davies, a true giant of the broadcast industry is to take her leave - Dawn Airey's PA, Elspeth Clarke MBE. Elspeth, the best-known PA in the business, is retiring nearly 40 years after joining Rediffusion TV in 1965. Monkey's favourite story is how she used to get out the German bunting at Five whenever its German owner, RTL, visited. No word, though, on whether she gets the Stars and Stripes out for the Murdochs. </p> <p>* Here's a tip for Times editor Robert Thomson: if you're desperate to give away piles of your dismal jobs section, Careers (perhaps that should say attempt to give away, as the poor chap who approached Monkey was finding no takers), avoid the underground station down the road from the Guardian.</p>",

  "<p><strong> Newspapers:</strong> At work, all of them pile up in towers that taunt and challenge you, even as they entice. So the joy at home is deciding not to take some of them. No names, but it's nice not to have them in the house. At the moment I'm addicted to the New York Times and Washington Post online for Bush-Kerry reasons. </p> <p><strong> Magazines:</strong> Are there still people who don't know about the Week? Maybe there are. But they should. It's the happiest shortcut I know. The New Statesman is also livelier than for many years past. </p> <p><strong> Books:</strong> I tend to have the serious and the flippant on the go at the same time, with some gore to keep me cheerful. James Lee Burke is an old passion on the dark side (In the Moon of Red Ponies is vintage low life in the Montana wilds). Hague's Pitt is there; McCrum's Wodehouse awaits. Molly Ivins on George W is always a laugh, and sharp as nails. </p> <p><strong> TV:</strong> I watch very little these days. But BBC4 is becoming one of the success stories of our time. Even my gentle surfing has given me enough gardening, wallpaper, deranged chefs and Big Brother spin-offs to see me through a few lifetimes, though strangely the children have persuaded me that Pop Idol is a harmless obsession. </p> <p><strong> Radio: </strong> I hope I'd care as much about Radio 4 even I didn't work for it; and I'm sure I would. I often start my day with the World Service at 3am, and it's still an incomparable network in what it sets out to do. 5 Live sport, of course, and Radio 3 for uplift. </p> <p><strong> Ads:</strong> Have ads on TV and in the cinema reached a plateau of professionalism that drains them of surprise and drama? I'm pleased to say that I can't think of one that makes me laugh or cry. </p> <p><strong> New media:</strong> American political sites. Nationaljournal.com is a good starting place, with Charlie Cook's Off to the Races column a joy. Venerable readers will remember the footballer Charlie Cooke who played for Aberdeen and then went to pot with Chelsea ... no relation. </p> <p><strong>\u00b7 </strong>James Naughtie presents Today and Bookclub on Radio 4. His latest book is The Accidental American, published by Macmillan. </p>"
