  "The Natural is playing on the sound system when George Bush walks on to the stage at a rally in Minnesota, and the message is clear. <p>The baseball movie anthem is fitting not just because the president is meeting his followers at a ballpark. It is also a boast that this is what Mr Bush does best. </p> <p>Back in Washington - a capital the president derides at every opportunity - he is awkward and defensive with the press. </p> <p>Ad-libbing on complex policy issues is often a recipe for embarrassment. </p> <p>But out in the small towns of America, delivering speeches crafted in short, punchy sentences to suit his Texan twang, America's commander-in-chief is formidable. </p> <p>When he is waiting his turn to speak, Mr Bush stands on the podium like a gunfighter. His shoulders hunch slightly as he squints into the distance, and his hands hang a few inches away from his hips, as if his pectoral muscles were too big to let them fall to his side. </p> <p>When he acknowledges individuals in the crowd he gives them a wave or a thumbs-up from waist height, never raising his arms. </p> <p>The Bush stump speech is a variation on a standard text agreed months ago that has evolved on the road but never fundamentally altered. It is both script and game plan for the entire Bush re-election effort; a rhetorical tour de force that recasts his greatest disaster, Iraq, as a moral victory. In it, Mr Bush no longer claims to have been right about Saddam Hussein's weapons. He now tells America he was wrong for all the right reasons. </p> <p>\"Knowing what I know today, even though we haven't found the stockpiles of weapons we thought were there, I'd have still made the same decision,\" the president told supporters in the farming community of St Cloud. \"I would have made the same decision because he had the capability of making weapons and he could have passed that capability on to an enemy. I would have made that same decision because I'll never forget the lessons of September the 11th, 2001.\" </p> <p>Bush runs through a checklist of domestic themes, portraying even small remedial measures to the nation's woeful health insurance system as portents of visionary change. </p> <p>Ultimately, though, the script returns to the nub of his whole campaign: the comfort of decisive leadership in uncertain times, and the danger of electing someone who might see both sides of a problem and therefore send \"mixed signals\" to friends and enemies alike. </p> <p>\"It is critical that the president of the United States speaks clearly and consistently at this time of great threat in the world and not change positions because of expediency or pressure,\" Mr Bush said. </p> <p>\"The Natural\" was a title once bestowed on Bill Clinton, the consummate campaigner. Mr Bush cannot think on his feet like his predecessor, but he shares his ability to talk to a crowd as if he was \"one of them\". And he is far more disciplined than Mr Clinton ever was. </p> <p>On a bus tour through Minnesota on Thursday, he took his message to enthusiastic crowds in three modest towns. Two of the venues were baseball fields, the perfect setting for the president's optimistic view of America and its place in the world. Ballparks are cherished icons of American innocence, patriotism and \"family values\". </p> <p>In St Cloud, even the long-haired warm-up band from Nashville sang about moral redemption and the dangers of \"neglected responsibilities\". The song was called Shame on Me. </p> <p>It was probably one of the last hot days of Minnesota's short summer, and the sun lit up the outfield to a fluorescent green. Small boys perched on the crowd barriers and waved plastic flags in time to the music. </p> <p>The last time Minnesota voted for a Republican president, it was for Richard Nixon in 1972. This is a state carved out by German and Swedish immigrants who brought traces of social democracy from Europe. The lineage is illustrated by all the blond heads in the crowd, but the political traditions have faded faster, and the terrorist attacks of three years ago have jumbled the electoral arithmetic still further. </p> <p>Minnesota is now winnable for President Bush, as he rides the surge that followed the Republican convention. A statewide opinion poll published by a local paper on Thursday showed him ahead of Senator Kerry for the first time. </p> <p>The number of Minnesotans who ranked terrorism and homeland security as the most important campaign issue had doubled since July, a tangible success for the president's speechwriters. </p> <p>Mike Kittridge, a personnel manager from St Cloud who described himself as a former swing voter, said: \"I'm going to go Bush for sure this time. I feel more comfortable and safer with him now terrorism is such a big issue. He's not afraid to act on his own, and he's not going to ask other countries for permission to act.\" </p> <p>It was a line straight from Mr Bush's talking points, as was Mr Kittridge's assessment of the president's challenger: \"I think people right now don't know Kerry's positions on the issues. He waffles too much.\" </p> <p>The Bush bus tour itself is a show of strength. The presidential motorcade ploughs through the flat farmland, a blur of red white and blue buses, shiny black vans with dark windows and a dozen police cars full of state troopers, multicoloured lights flashing. Uniformed men with machine guns patrol rivers that the caravan crosses for a few seconds while black helicopters hang in the air on each side, defending an aerial exclusion zone which encases the entourage like a moving bubble. Minnesotans lined the road to wave, or just gawp at the sheer power an American president has at his disposal. </p> <p>Such are the advantages of incumbency. But its downside can be just as steep. For nearly four years, President Bush has been sheltered from the sort of hostile questioning he will face in his debates with Senator Kerry, starting at the end of this month, when he will almost certainly be forced off his script. </p> <p>The president is also a hostage to whatever happens in Iraq. Every death there threatens to make his much touted resolve seem more like folly, for which others are paying the price.</p>",
  "<b>Education</b> <p>This year lies halfway between 2020 and 1988, when Kenneth Baker, the then education secretary, delivered a package of measures that continue to define the modern educational era. In schools alone, the Education Reform Act introduced the national curriculum and testing at seven, 11 and 14; handed control of budgets to headteachers; and invented grant-maintained schools and city technology colleges, the precursors of specialist schools and city academies. </p> <p>Sixteen years on, some of the act's roughest edges have been smoothed, but the educational landscape is more than merely Baker-lite. Since 1988 Whitehall has meddled virtually at will in the content of the curriculum, prescribing huge chunks of the daily school timetables of children across the country. On the other hand, headteachers have become the most influential lobby group in education, as successive Tory and Labour governments pass ever greater power - and responsibility - towards them and away from local councils. And specialist schools have become this government's preferred model for (it believes) raising standards and (it hopes) persuading into the state fold some of the stubborn 7% of parents who continue to send their children to private schools.</p> <p>Maybe somebody - perhaps Gordon Brown if he changes his address by one digit - will abandon specialist schools and the perverse logic of expecting big rural comprehensives to focus on a particular area. </p> <p>But how wide will the changes in education really be by 2020? Heads will still hold the purse strings and local education authorities will probably not even exist. The best guess is that something called, and reminiscent of, the national curriculum will still be in place. Possibly this will be confined to five- to 14-year-olds, especially if trends to greater specialisation and differentiation from 14 on continue. If the government can get a positive consensus on the proposals in Mike Tomlinson's final report, in October, on reform of education of 14- to 19-year-olds, that will become more likely. </p> <p>Fourteen will have replaced 16 as the watershed moment in secondary education, with many more students taking vocational courses. There will be new qualifications to replace GCSEs and A-levels, the exams hardly anyone fails. But students will also take fewer exams: the generation at university now have had the worst of that. But there are almost bound to be complaints in 2020 about the failure to deliver \"parity of esteem\" between work-related and academic learning. There is nothing to suggest industry will deliver the input and enthusiasm to really turn that around.</p> <p>Taking a wider view, it is likely that many children will be taught in classes of 50 or more, with teachers working in teams, with other teachers or groups of classroom assistants. No counter-revolution will be able to obliterate that trend. The status of the teaching profession will still be diminished and the government will not have been able to convince jobseekers that the classroom is the place for them. Most of the best graduates will continue to turn their backs on teaching, to the constant complaints of the (by then) single classroom teachers' union. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Will Woodward is the Guardian's education editor</p> <p><b>Transport</b></p> <p>As they power along eight-lane motorways in their Asian-built electric cars - set to cruise control, naturally - drivers in 2020 will have plenty of time to think about how they will pay their next road-charge bill. A monthly envelope totting up the cost of each car journey will be routine by the end of the next decade if the government's long-term transport plans are anything to go by.</p> <p>Satellite tracking technology will enable the authorities to monitor every car journey - how long it took, how far it was, how fast it was - to calculate a journey charge of up to \u00a31.30 a mile. Driving in many of Britain's cities will require a congestion charge; many motorway journeys will be punctuated by toll booths.</p> <p>The transport secretary, Alistair Darling, wants to begin levying a price for road space. The Conservatives support the idea in principle. But without such a radical change, the future for motorists will be bleak. </p> <p>Wages, wanderlust and globalisation are fuelling a desire to travel. Professor Marcial Echenique of Cambridge University reckons that, by 2021, we will all clock up an extra 1,000 miles a year by road or rail - raising the prospect of rush hours lasting from 5am until midday. \"The congestion will extend, so there will be no period without congestion,\" Prof Echenique warned in a study published earlier this year.</p> <p>Maverick motoring groups who blow up speed cameras will have more to get militant by 2020. A government-funded initiative on trial at Leeds University is examining the possibility of cars having \"intelligent\" accelerators that resist when drivers try to break the speed limit. Traditional speed humps are likely to go in favour of advanced models, which will sink for slower vehicles but stiffen to impede speeders. Many commuter routes will have high-occupancy vehicle lanes for cars with at least two people on board. To help pay their five-figure annual tuition fees, students will be hiring themselves out as passengers.</p> <p>The alternatives to motoring are likely to suffer from familiar problems. Network Rail reckons that by 2015 it can bring punctuality on the railways up from 81% to 91.7%. Says Tony Travers, of the London School of Economics: \"There are some eternal verities about transport policy. One is the maladministration of the railways and the fact that they're forever teetering on the brink of some form of Beeching's axe.\"</p> <p>On the bright side, both east and west coast mainlines ought to have been upgraded by 2020, with superior signalling allowing twice as many trains between London, the north of England and Scotland. But while tilting technology will be commonplace, there is little indication the money will be forthcoming to push speeds beyond the present maximum of 125mph.</p> <p>Commuters in the south-east will benefit from an upgrade to Thameslink and from high-speed local trains through Kent on the Channel tunnel rail link. The East London Line will be extended and joined to other suburban tracks to create an \"inner rail ring road\" around the capital. But only the most devoted optimists can confidently predict that Crossrail, the \u00a310bn east-west link across London, will be built by 2020.</p> <p>Britain's Victorian railway network will never be likely to match its German or Japanese rivals in speed and reliability for long-distance journeys. The disastrous \u00a37.5bn, decade-long struggle to model the west-coast mainline is likely to cast a shadow over rail policy for decades, deterring ambitious state schemes.</p> <p>Aviation could play a much bigger part in domestic transport. In a white paper on aviation last year, the government backed new runways at Stansted, Heathrow, Birmingham and Edinburgh. Government figures say the number of passengers using Britain's airports will leap from 189m to 460m by 2020.</p> <p>Heathrow will no longer be the world's busiest international airport, losing out through lack of space to Paris and Amsterdam. But journeys from Bournemouth to Newcastle or between London and Plymouth could well be on fast, cheap aircraft.</p> <p>Whether a Labour, Conservative or UK Independence party government is in power in 2020, the job of secretary of state for transport will still be a hiding to nothing. The challenges of congestion and pollution will persist. Travellers are likely to have more choice in how they get from A to B and their journeys will probably be safer. But whether moving around will be quicker, cheaper or more reliable than today is deeply doubtful.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Andrew Clark is the Guardian's transport correspondent</p> <p><b>Immigration</b></p> <p>Immigration will feature ever more strongly in daily politics as the 21st century unfolds. In Britain immigration will be seen as an essential component of economic growth and a prerequisite for a healthy economy. But this will not happen in the same way as in the US and Australia in the 19th and 20th centuries, when they built multicultural societies on a positive historical legacy of integrating waves of migrants through the common goal of citizenship.</p> <p>Instead, by 2020 British immigration policy will be founded on the fact of our ageing society. Britain will have fewer people of working age trying to support a growing number of retired people. Britain is likely to encourage immigration on a scale that current levels only hint at, but in the process there is a danger we will develop a two-tier workforce that has more in common with the gastarbeiter economy of the old West Germany than on any American melting pot example.</p> <p>The basis for that prediction lies in the United Nations report Replacement Migration, published in 2000. It estimated that Britain needs to attract a million people a year between now and 2050 to maintain the balance between the workforce and the retired population. That might be regarded as unduly pessimistic, but even the most recent figures from the government actuary suggest that by 2020 there will be 20% more older people than younger adults. </p> <p>The majority of people in their 60s and 70s will be healthy and active; they will demand ever more consumer items and the personal services that go with increased leisure time. There will also be a growing welfare sector to care for the ageing population. The retirement homes of Bournemouth and Eastbourne will become key models for economic regeneration projects across the country. Home Office studies predict this will mean an increase in low-paid, low-skilled jobs that may be difficult to fill from the existing labour force.</p> <p>The pattern is already beginning to emerge in the hospitality and catering industries, where low-wage jobs with little security are increasingly being filled by migrants. The government's role is to ensure they can come here legally and get paid the minimum wage. But for this strategy to succeed longer-term, British governments will have to have come to terms with the flourishing hidden economy of illegal migrants. Otherwise the two-tier workforce will be even more likely. </p> <p>That means that a way to \"regularise\" the position of illegal migrants already in Britain will have to be found. By 2020 it could become a regular feature of British life, with amnesties granted to illegal immigrants before each general election. And if you think that could not happen, look to the US. Earlier this year, President George Bush thought it politic to give three-year work permits and possible citizenship to up to eight million \"undocumented\" workers living mainly in New Mexico and Arizona. His \"compassionate conservative\" move was, of course, really an attempt to capture the increasingly powerful Hispanic vote. Migrants here could soon hold equivalent political power.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Alan Travis is the Guardian's home affairs editor</p> <p><b>Economy</b></p> <p>Forecasting the economy is a mug's game. Who in the aftermath of the three-day week in 1974 would have predicted that by 1990 Britain would be down to a handful of pits and that the National Union of Mineworkers would be shrivelled and beaten? Who in 1984 would have bet that the early brick-like mobile phones would become the fastest-spreading technology in history?</p> <p>On the big assumption that current trends continue, we should expect the UK to become even more dominated by the service sector, the City and the south-east. Europe's wealth is concentrated in a so-called golden banana that runs from northern Italy, through western Germany, eastern France and the Benelux countries and on across the Channel. While Europe's centre of gravity has moved eastward with enlargement, the plains of Lombardy, Bavaria, the Seine basin and the London diaspora will be the continent's unchallenged economic powerhouse for the next two decades at least. </p> <p>As far as the rest of the world is concerned, the big story will be the continued emergence of the three big developing countries - China, Brazil and India. In sheer size, rather than per capita incomes, these countries may soon rank behind only the US. Europe's demographics and its sluggish growth rate mean it will stay rich but be in relative economic decline.</p> <p>That's the easy bit. In reality, things will probably work out differently. The optimistic scenario is that the new wave of inventions over the past couple of decades has pushed the global economy to the cusp of a new golden age. All previous long upswings were based on technological change, and in this view the internet, the mapping of the human genome and robotics are to the coming boom what the car, the plane and the cinema were to the postwar golden age.</p> <p>The pessimistic view is that the future of the global economy is jeopardised by two big threats - one financial, the other environmental. Over the past decade, there has been a rise both in the number of financial crises and in the damage they have caused. With the US awash with personal debt, and running massive trade and budget deficits, the danger is that the next crisis will not be in a developing country like Argentina but at the very heart of the global economy.</p> <p>The other danger is that nobody has worked out what to do if and when the oil runs out. This is an issue that has been ducked by policy makers since the Yom Kippur war in 1973 brought to an end the long postwar boom. </p> <p>So there you have it. You can be an optimist and you can be a pessimist. Or, like me, you can be an optimistic pessimist: things look good in the long term, but there's plenty of choppy water to navigate first.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Larry Elliott is the Guardian's economics editor</p>",
  "<p>As the fury over Democratic senator Zell Miller's \"rabid and mean-spirited\" <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/uselections2004/story/0,13918,1306980,00.html\">speech</a> (as Jimmy Carter <a href=\"http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/week_2004_09_05.php#003438 \">described</a> it) at the Republican convention dissipates, Democrats have begun wondering what caused the senator's change of heart.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.robesonian.com/articles/2004/09/16/news/editorials/localeditorial01.txt\">Philip Gailey</a>, editor of editorials for the St Petersburg Times, writes: \"When Democrats are not denouncing Zell Miller as a traitor to his party, they are asking each other, \"What happened to Zell?\"</p> <p>\"It's a question I can't answer about a fellow Georgian I have known and respected for more than 40 years. I can't fully explain his bitter estrangement from the Democratic party, nor can I understand why, in his keynote speech at the Republican National Convention, the Georgia senator spoke so harshly and contemptuously about John Kerry, even questioning his fitness to be commander in chief. I did not recognise the man Republicans wildly cheered in Madison Square Garden, just as I don't recognise the man his critics are trashing these days.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.thebatt.com/news/2004/09/15/Opinion/Zell-Millers.Convention.Speech.tarnishes.His.Career.As.Democrat-718989.shtml\">Jonathan Smith</a>, writing in the Texas-based Battalion, points out some inconsistencies in Mr Miller's fierce attack on Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry (he described him as \"more wrong, more weak and more wobbly than any other national figure\").</p> <p>\"This rhetoric is a far cry from what Miller said when he introduced Kerry on March 1 2001 [at a political dinner],\" said Smith. On that occasion, Mr Miller told guests how \"John Kerry has fought against government waste and worked hard to bring some accountability to Washington\".</p> <p>\"Even though this sort of political displace is good for show, Miller's flip-floppery on the issue of Kerry hardly makes him a reliable source,\" Smith concludes.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.washingtondispatch.com/article_10055.shtml\">Paul Weyrich</a>, writing in the Washington Dispatch, believes he can help Democrats face some uncomfortable truths about Mr Miller's apparent change of heart. \"Senator Zell Miller, an ex marine, is angry that the party he spent a lifetime helping to build has gone so far to the left that it is barely recognisable. Miller attacked the Democratic nominee, Senator John Kerry, in terms that no Republican could dare to do. \"</p> <p><strong>George Wright</strong></p>",
  "Of all the horrors that George Bush has committed over the last four years, one of the most egregious has been his assault on the English language. <p>However, as this election campaign has heated up, something strange has happened - John Kerry has taken on the role of the oratorically challenged, and Bush is suddenly scoring As in the speech department.</p> <p>After 20 years in the Senate, Kerry has developed a meandering, circumlocutory speaking style. The point he is trying to make is pushed to the distant end of ridiculously long verbal structures. </p> <p>I had hoped that, during the campaign, his speechwriters would fix this problem - but no such luck. Here is a typical example from a recent stump speech:</p> <p>\"The other day, we were driving along the road in our campaign bus, and I saw a sign with a lone W leaning up against a post,\" Kerry began at a campaign stop in West Virginia last week. </p> <p>\"At first, I was a little confused. But then it all made sense. As the president likes to say, there's nothing complicated about it. It does all come down to one letter - W. George W Bush. What do you think that W stands for? That W stands for wrong. Wrong choices, wrong direction for America.\"</p> <p>That is what, in boxing, you call telegraphing your punches. Kerry took such an age to make his assertion, pausing for an excruciating caesura to no dramatic effect on the letter W, that by the time he got to his punchline he had almost lost the crowd. </p> <p>He lumbers along at a pace that almost matches Al Gore's for slowness. Wags once said Gore spoke English as if it were your second language. Kerry isn't that bad, but he makes it almost impossible for TV news producers to find a usable 10-second soundbite.</p> <p>I recommend that insomniacs among you read the full texts of his recent stump speeches - his August 12 offering on the economy, for example, took the biscuit for monotony. </p> <p>\"We've been told over and over again that America has turned the corner,\" he opined, before proceeding to use the phrase \"turned the corner\" over and over again himself - a staggering 11 times in all. There is a place for repetition in effective rhetoric but, by the 11th time, the motionless body of a whip-scarred horse had nullified any potential harm to Bush.</p> <p>Bush may not be an intellectual powerhouse, but he has a mugger's savvy for gutting a political opponent, and also has speechwriters who have nailed Kerry's vulnerabilities.</p> <p>\"After voting for the war, but against funding it,\" he chuckled from the stump in a jaunty sing-song, \"after saying he would have voted for the war even knowing everything we know today, my opponent woke up this week with new campaign advisers and yet another new position. Suddenly, he's against it again.\"</p> <p>There is nothing redundant in this campaign utterance. The \"for it/against it\" formulation is fuelled by ammunition Kerry has amply provided, and perfectly sets up Bush to say: \"No matter how many times he flip-flops, we were right to remove Saddam Hussein from power.\"</p> <p>While Bush can't take credit for the skill of his writers, his folksy, abbreviated style is all his own. One political observer has gone as far as saying \"Bushspeak\" is Mamet-like in its condensed, verbal economy. That may be too lofty, but even the introductory passages in his speeches - the bits not meant for media consumption - are packed with subliminal meaning.</p> <p>\"Thanks for coming,\" a typical stump speech begins. \"I'm proud you came out. I'm honoured you are here. I'm pleased to be with the good folks here in Johnstown. I know you like to hunt and fish. So do I. I know you care about your neighbours. I appreciate that.\"</p> <p>The longest sentence in this passage is 11 words. The average is five. In a few sparse phrases, Bush has effectively conveyed that he is one of you, he shares your values, and he is humbly worthy of your vote. Compare it to one of Kerry's favourite warm-up lines: </p> <p>\"I've travelled from one end of this country to the other,\" he informs the crowd (as though they might be unaware he's in the midst of a national campaign), \"from great cities to the great south-west, from the flag-draped front porches of main street America to the small family farms that dot the Midwest. I'm proud that we've made this great journey together.\" </p> <p>The lines are pompous huff and puff - a string of clich\u00e9s almost devoid of meaning. </p> <p>\"An army of pompous phrases moving across the landscape in search of an idea\" was the criticism applied to speeches by Warren Harding - one of only two senators to make it to the White House. The aphorism, unfortunately, applies to too much of Kerry's rhetoric. </p> <p>It gives me no pleasure to harangue Kerry for his oratorical inadequacies - but clearly the people close to him aren't being honest. Someone from his inner circle needs to grab him by the lapels and yell: \"Get your act together!\"</p> <p>It's not as though all his speeches are bad. On the day the assault weapons ban expired, he came out with this zinger: \"George Bush chose to make the job of terrorists easier and make the job of America's police officers harder - and that's just plain wrong.\"</p> <p>However, Kerry needs to dramatically increase his zinger ratio and find a style that, if not folksy, is at least less condescending. I found a line on his website that captures the right tone: \"Everywhere in America, families sit at the kitchen table and divide the bills into two piles: one says 'pay now' and the other says 'pay later'. You're worrying that this week's paycheck won't cover last week's doctor's bill. That it won't cover the mortgage and the college tuition bill.\"</p> <p>The line comes from a speech by Kerry's running mate, John Edwards. Kerry should steal some more from him.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Philip James is a former senior Democratic party strategist</p>",

  "In the current US election season, Dickie Pilager's <a href=\"http://www.dickiepilager.com/\">website</a> stands out as a model of clarity and vision. Here is the candidate standing before a view of the mountains and lakes of his native Colorado, extolling the virtues of the outdoor life. Here is the family man, praising family life and the American way. And here is the nitty-gritty of his campaign: his views on healthcare, education, gun control, abortion and the environment. <p>Like many other candidates, Dickie Pilager has learned a lesson from Howard Dean and his army of Deaniacs; his website is about involvement, providing a virtual forum for supporters to meet likeminded souls. </p> <p>But there is one aspect in which Mr Pilager is different to most of the other candidates in this election season: he is a work of fiction. </p> <p>Dickie is the lead character in Silver City, a political drama made by the veteran film director John Sayles, which is due to be released in the US today. Made with a budget of just $5.5m (about \u00a33m), the film boasts an ensemble cast of Sayles regulars, including Chris Cooper, Daryl Hannah, Richard Dreyfuss, Kris Kristofferson, Thora Birch and Tim Roth. </p> <p>While documentary makers, with Michael Moore at the forefront, have led cinema's response to the current political mood, narrative films have been slower off the mark. But Sayles has made up for lost time. The director, best known for Lone Star, Limbo and Sunshine State, was prompted to make Silver City by what he saw when filming in Florida during the 2000 presidential election. </p> <p>He told the website Comingsoon.net: \"Many people on our crew and in the community asked, what was the deal with the national media? They're not covering the real story down here, which is not these hanging chads, it's how many African-Americans did not get to vote. </p> <p>\"I've felt like our democracy was under attack from various sides, and it was important to get something out before the election.\"</p> <p>For a director renowned for the subtlety of his films, Sayles's chosen tool was decidedly blunt: satire. Silver City tells the story of the bumbling wayward son of a political dynasty, unable to think on his feet, let alone string a sentence together, who is anointed as the candidate by the business interests that run the state of Colorado. </p> <p>Played by Cooper, most recently seen in The Bourne Identity, Dickie is a dead ringer for George W Bush, from the hesitant bewilderment of his grin to his protean ability to mangle words. His campaign slogan is \"Honesty, integrity, articulacy\". </p> <p>\"We have to get our priorities straight,\" he tells an impromptu gathering of reporters in one scene. \"Education is a priority. Healthcare is a priority. Our economy is a priority. The environmental... the whole environmental arena, that's a priority, a big priority.\" </p> <p>Sayles has not denied the similarity to Bush, saying that Pilager was modelled on the political neophyte when he first ran for governor of Texas. </p> <p>But his target, he claims, is not so much Bush as the system, and his aim is to prompt voters to make the connection between the often incompetent politicians who lead them and the interests that got them elected and direct their energies. </p> <p>Sayles argues that the real villain of the piece is not the candidate but the big businessman, played by Kris Kristofferson. There is, he told National Public Radio in the US, \"a question for all of us, which is: Do we expect our candidates, do we expect our public officials... to actually be people who know anything, who can govern? Or do we expect them to just be mascots for the people who are really running things?\" </p> <p>While the film is unlikely to preach beyond its converted base - Sayles labours under the tag \"liberal film-maker\" - Fahrenheit 9/11 has shown that the impact of a film can be considerable in such a hard-fought election. Already Silver City has attracted the opprobrium of one bastion of conservatism, Rupert Murdoch's Fox News Network, which named it - along with Michael Moore's film and the environmental disaster movie The Day After Tomorrow - Hollywood's contribution to the John Kerry campaign.</p>",

  "Prime ministers make environment speeches about every two years. Invariably they make platitudinous statements about how important nature is for today's quality of life and tomorrow's generations. On Tuesday Tony Blair took the now orthodox line - just as he did in 2000 and 2002 - that climate change is happening as a result of human behaviour, and that disaster looms if nothing is done to avert it. <p>This green speech was the most anxious of the three Mr Blair has made in office, mixing evidence of the growing number of extreme climatic events with estimates of the escalating costs of dealing with more frequent and intense heat waves, floods and storms. The overriding positive, he said, was that \"with the political and collective will\", climate change could be addressed. </p> <p>But for all the green rhetoric, there's little evidence yet that this government - or any other - has the political will to address what is now accepted as a potentially overwhelming global problem. </p> <p>Britain sees itself as the world leader in cutting greenhouse gas emissions, and aims, ambitiously, to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 60% from their 1990 levels by 2050. But the government glosses over the fact that we are on track to miss by a mile our commitment to reduce emissions by 20% by 2010. </p> <p>The evidence comes from Cambridge Econometrics, the leading independent trackers and forecasters of UK greenhouse gas emissions. In a study published in July, they said we would easily meet the far lower targets required under the still unratified Kyoto agreement. </p> <p>Emissions from power generation, said the authors, are likely to drop by 5.5%, largely because of the investment in wind power, but those from domestic and transport sources are rising steeply, undermining the push to renewables. Emissions from road transport will, by 2010, rise by 14% from 1990 levels. </p> <p>The problem, agreed other political parties and most environment groups this week, is that the government is pursuing two opposite agendas. Even as green Labour urges business and consumers to invest in renewables and use less power, grey Labour is quietly engineering some of the greatest expansions seen in road and air transport in decades. The result is that emissions are rising and little real environmental progress is possible. </p> <p>The responsibility for domestic energy conservation, point out the greens, has been passed to cash-starved local authorities; the government has presided over a 17% increase in road traffic; reduced its support for renewables; and is well short of its target to spend a meagre \u00a320m on solar roofs. Meanwhile, it is subsidising by \u00a3500m the new Airbus - 13 times the total amount pledged for all non-nuclear renewables in 2002. It may have encouraged a massive increase in wind power, but the consensus is that it is not getting to grips with energy conservation, nor is it pushing strongly enough for alternatives like marine power. </p> <p>Last month, the environmental audit committee of the Commons agreed. Its report on energy and climate change said the government's energy strategy was now \"seriously off course\" and that \"more imaginative and radical\" policies were needed for transport. Transport's share of UK emissions, it says, will rise from 18.7% in 1990 to an expected 26.3% in 2010. Air transport's has almost doubled between 1990 and 2002, moving groups like Transport 2000 to accuse the government of being \"in denial\". </p> <p>But Mr Blair, encouraged by the Foreign Office, which has long seen the diplomatic benefit of Britain being a global environmental leader, has his sights on getting the world to change its energy habits. Next year, he said on Tuesday, Britain will use its presidency of the EU and the G8 to push for international climate change action. </p> <p>This is optimistic, if much needed. Far from being the environmental paragon it likes to suggest it is, Europe is on course to fail to meet even its low Kyoto target of 5.2% cuts in emissions on 1990 figures by 2012. According to the European Environment Agency, overall emissions are only 2.1% lower than in 1990. Only France, Germany, Sweden and the UK are likely to meet their targets and Spain, Portugal, Ireland, Austria, Italy, Denmark and Greece are all expected to overshoot - some substantially. Most OECD countries have the same problems as Britain: carbon dioxide emissions from vehicles in Europe will rise by 30% by 2010, says the agency. </p> <p>Mr Blair, who is pinning his hopes on the emergence of an international trading market in emissions and better technology, will have an even more uphill struggle to persuade countries outside Europe to cut emissions. George Bush reportedly now accepts the evidence that climate change is happening, but his administration is implacably opposed to the Kyoto process which involves only rich countries cutting back emissions. Meanwhile, John Kerry is coy about committing the US to cuts. </p> <p>Russia is the wild card on which the Kyoto process depends. But it is preocccupied and quite likely to kill off the international treaty - which took more than 10 years to negotiate - by delaying its decision to the point where it is too late for countries to adopt in time to cut emissions. </p> <p>The government will soon review its climate change strategy, and can be expected to come up with some eye-catching solar and alternative energy plans. But until it gets to grips with transport, it will continue to be running with the hares and riding with the hounds. Which mostly ends in disaster. </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> John Vidal is the Guardian's environment editor </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:john.vidal@theguardian.com\">john.vidal@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "<p>If George Duke does this weekend at the Jazz Cafe what he did on his last visit to London, the audience can expect to be taken around a few surprising corners by his infectious mix of fusion grooves. That's not the priority in this Sony double-disc collection of the funk keyboardist's 1970s work on the Epic label, released here this week to coincide with the gigs. None of the music includes Duke's fine sideman work for Cannonball Adderley, Jean-Luc Ponty or Frank Zappa, but all of his major dancefloor hits are here, including Reach Out, Dukey Stick and Sweet Baby, as well as some of the Latin material from Brazilian Love Affair. It's all party music and nobody plays much that you don't hear coming, but some of Stanley Clarke's electric bass solos are grandiloquently dazzling, and Duke himself reveals a few glimpses of that fierce piano talent.</p>",
  "<p>One of the presidential election campaign's stranger sights to date has been that of John Kerry sharing a podium with Blink-182's Tom DeLonge, the man behind such albums as Enema of the State. Californian punk-pop, usually concerned with cars and girls, has abruptly reconnected with punk's tradition of social outrage. Even so, it's surprising to hear Green Day, the trio whose pogoing skate-pop inadvertently invented Busted, warning us of the dangers of \"one nation controlled by the media\". Like, dude, what's up?</p> <p>If Joe Strummer's spirit stalks American Idiot, so too does Pete Townshend's. This is a fully-fledged rock opera - which is almost as chilling a concept as a second Bush term, although Green Day's muscular grasp of pop verities steers them safely away from conceptual meltdown. The album's opposing poles are its two, nine-minute, five-part song suites: Jesus of Suburbia boldly traverses snotty punk, arena rock and the Beach Boys, while Homecoming sounds like the finale of a calamitous Broadway musical. Between the two, American Idiot is a mess - but a vivid, splashy, even courageous mess.</p>",
  "<b>\u00b7 </b>Tony McGurk is on bright and early to express concern about Wednesday's security lapse at the Commons, in which a pop star's son and a polo player got near enough to a minister to pull his shirt-tails out, although thankfully this was averted. What bemuses Tony most is that the BBC, which admitted that it had failed to act on a tip-off about the invasion, had the nerve to turn round and ask (through its Newsnight Hydra-head, Gavin Essler) Alun Michael what might have happened if this had been a more serious threat. \"We could have had a bloodbath then, Gavin,\" says McGurk, providing an answer which failed to occur to Mr Michael at the time, \"which would have been laid at the door of the BBC\". It's easy with hindsight, Tony. <p><b>\u00b7 </b>The BBC said of the tip-off that \"it had not been certain the incident would take place and the information had come from somebody the journalist had never met\". Fair enough, you might think, especially since the Diary itself has a firm policy of never speaking to anyone it doesn't remember from school. But hang on: Otis Ferry, the protesters' ringleader and son of Bryan, went to Marlborough. Is it really possible that he doesn't know anyone at the BBC? If not, can someone please effect an introduction? Our safety depends on it. </p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>The Diary's very own conspiracy theory, the one about Kerry taking a dive this autumn to give Hillary Clinton a clear run in 2008, has been utterly overtaken by events. The conspiracy, you'll remember, had a dismal launch on the rightwing chatroom <a href=\"http://www.freerepublic.com\">freerepublic.com</a>, where folks were already well ahead of us: many Freepers (for so they are known there) seem convinced that Hillary has been supplying forged documents besmirching Bush's otherwise spotless war record (avoided one, started one) in order to sabotage the Kerry campaign. Now even this theory is old hat, what with Democrats insisting that Bush's people supplied the damning evidence themselves, using documents which could later be proved fakes. Just as the whole thing has grown rather tiresome, the Diary itself has become the story. </p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>Yesterday's Diary, which revealed that a short-lived freerepublic thread suggesting true conservatives should vote Kerry this November in order to prevent a Hillary Clinton victory in 2008 (stay with us here) was in fact the work of Diary operatives, has now been reprinted in full as part a new Freeper thread entitled \"Diary (lame Guardian hit piece on FR)\". And 95 replies already! Proof, if proof were needed, of the power of technology: you write it in a national broadsheet today, and tomorrow it appears on a funny little website halfway round the world. Miraculous. </p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>Not all the comments are kind, but some are sort of cute: \"Hate to inform such an intelligent person that they have no clue what first amendment rights are. But first of all being that you are not an American citizen, Our [nice capitalisation] Constitution doesn't cover you.\" Excellent point, Mr \"Always Right\", although make no hasty assumptions: you have no idea what sort of skeletons are to be found in the Diary's passport drawer. </p> <p><b>\u00b7 </b>\"Actually our lame British cousin has it backwards,\" says another. \"All true liberals and Democrats should vote to re-elect President Bush so that Hillary will have a better shot at 2008.\" This, we must admit, makes at least as much sense as our original theory. \"Another foreigner upset because he can't influence our elections,\" reads a third, providing a helpful reminder for us to get that absentee ballot application in the post. Finally, the Diary has received some explosive information about a big upcoming... actually, forget it. No, really - it's probably nothing. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:diary@theguardian.com\">diary@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "President Bush's chief domestic security official yesterday apologised for the disruption of a big MI5 and police surveillance operation in Britain. <p>Tom Ridge, the homeland security secretary, said the leaking of intelligence in the US about alleged terrorist suspects here was \"regrettable\". </p> <p>Mr Ridge was speaking to journalists in London before meeting David Blunkett and Sir David Omand, the prime minister's security and intelligence coordinator. </p> <p>Whitehall was furious early last month when individuals were named and allegations about terrorist attacks were made public in the US. </p> <p>The claims, about putative attacks on buildings in the US and on British targets, including Heathrow, were based on information found on the computers of an alleged al-Qaida sympathiser in Pakistan.</p> <p>The disclosures forced the police to quickly arrest 12 suspects in raids across England. </p> <p>In Blackburn, Lancashire, armed officers pulled two men out of a Mercedes, and in Luton, Bedfordshire, neighbours told how dozens of police had halted a red Nissan in a residential street and pinned the driver against the door for almost three hours. </p> <p>Anti-terrorist officials here have been seriously concerned about the disclosure of infor mation in America which, they say, could prejudice the outcome of prosecutions. </p> <p>They are also unhappy about the frequency of public warnings in the US about possible attacks - something which, say Whitehall officials, could lead to the dangers of \"crying wolf\" or \"threat fatigue\". </p> <p>Mr Ridge said that the US had raised its threat level and placed extra armed guards around buildings because of \"credible\" and \"specific\" information coming from Pakistan. </p> <p>\"The volume of potential information was the largest we have ever seen,\" he said. </p> <p>He added that there was credible intelligence of terrorist plans to \"disrupt the democratic process\" in the US. </p> <p>The \"intent\" had been exposed but there was no specific intelligence, he said. </p> <p>Asked about the impact of a terrorist attack in the run-up to November's presidential election, Mr Ridge said it would unify the US \"more than ever\". </p> <p>A joint contact group has been set up in which the US and Britain share counter-terrorist information. </p> <p>One proposal being discussed is an international register whereby frequent travellers would voluntarily provide information to security agencies and airlines about their personal characteristics so that they can pass security controls more quickly.</p>"
