  "<p>A few years back, Bruce Springsteen was asked to name a living American to whom he looked as an inspiration. 'I'll tell you, those three recent books by Philip Roth just knocked me on my ass,' the Boss replied. 'To be in his sixties making work that is so strong, so full of revelations about love and emotional pain, that's the way to live your artistic life. Sustain, sustain, sustain.'</p> <p>Springsteen, who hails from the same industrial New Jersey landscape as Roth, and who has written several mythic songs about chasing the American dream, saw in Roth a late resurgence of creative genius that made everything that preceded it seem like a mere prelude to greatness.</p> <p>Now 71, Roth's literary second coming began in 1995 with Sabbath's Theater, the novel that signalled a new epic register. Since then, he has been untouchable, bequeathing us a late body of work - the trilogy Springsteen was referring to, American Pastoral (1997), I Married A Communist (1998), and The Human Stain (2000) - that adds up to the most accomplished dissection of American political, social and personal mores since John Updike's great, but nowhere near as adventurous or provocative, Rabbit series spanning four decades.</p> <p>These books map out the America that Roth has grown up, and grown old, in, and are driven by a relentless narrative energy, and a righteous anger that simmers just below the surface, reignited rather than dimmed by age. Roth's abiding theme is the impact of history on the individual. In American Pastoral, which may be his masterpiece, he tackles homegrown terrorism, the kind that grew out of Sixties radicalism rather than Eighties survivalism, and the psychic havoc a daughter's single act of politically motivated violence wreaks on her father's life. In I Married A Communist, he considers personal betrayal, and dissects the lingering damage done to democracy, and to individual lives, by McCarthyism. In The Human Stain, his subjects are political correctness, race, old age, and the chaotic, but re-energising, power of chemically driven sexual desire. While newer talents such as Don DeLillo and Jonathan Franzen have been praised for their attempts to create the Great American Novel for our times, Roth, without fuss or fanfare, has written four of them in the last decade. And, in his seventh decade.</p> <p>'He is without doubt the greatest novelist writing in English today', says the author and journalist, Linda Grant. 'Anyone, anywhere, interested in the construction of a sentence would have to admire, and be enthralled, by his writing. Plus, his themes are so significant: the arc of a man's life, the destructive force of history, and all against a backdrop that spans his own lifetime. It's an enormous undertaking, and, more than any other writer, he has the command of language and form required to pull it off.'</p> <p>On 7 October, Roth unveils his 26th, and perhaps most audacious, novel, The Plot Against America. Set in the early 1940s, it is a provocative re-imagining of history: Charles Lindbergh, the aviation hero, defeats Franklin Roosevelt by a landslide to become US president. Under Lindbergh, a Nazi sympathiser and anti-Semite, America negotiates an entente cordiale with Nazi Germany, and undertakes a policy of Jewish resettlement. As well as rewriting the destinies of famous public figures, Roth re-imagines the life of his own family and their neighbours in a Jewish enclave of Newark, during the fearful years of the Lindbergh presidency. The narrative unfolds from the point of view of Roth's seven-year-old self, rather than the semi-fictional versions of himself he has used in the past in some of his more formally experimental books.</p> <p>'I know these people,' says his longtime friend, and former publisher, Aaron Ascher, 'his mother and father, who have both passed on, and his older brother, Sanford. It is so startling to see them brought so alive on the page, and so moving it had me in tears more than once. His father is alive in every word, every nuance of speech. It's the audacity of writing about his real family that gets me, and that he has put them at the very centre of his most overtly political book.'</p> <p>Though ostensibly a historical drama, it is impossible to read The Plot Against America without thinking of the country's current leadership, and sensing Roth's dismay at the evangelical Christian belief system that underpins policy. His father, who is very much the conscience of the novel, says: '...every day I ask myself the same question: How can this be happening in America? How can people like these be in charge of our country? If I didn't see it with my own eyes, I'd think I was having a hallucination.'</p> <p>Roth, says Ascher, insists the book is purely about the past. 'He claims he was not thinking about Bush and co at all, but the story is so shocking and so pertinent. This is politically charged writing, and it's coming out in October, just in time for the election. I just hope enough people get to read it.'</p> <p>The Plot Against America is also a book about anti-Semitism. It is not the first time that Roth, who Ascher describes as 'an avowed atheist but utterly, inescapably Jewish', has broached this subject, but it is the first time he has tackled it head on. 'It's an incredibly brave move,' says Grant. 'He shows how anti-Semitism can take hold of a society through certain ways of thinking in politics, and even culture, and not just though personal hatred of Jews. He's picking up on the undercurrents that are abroad right now.'</p> <p>By bringing the bigger national drama into the heart of a Jewish family Roth ups the ante both morally and dramatically. 'While the father has a strong and unwavering moral authority,' continues Grant, 'there is also an impressionable son, a shallow, self-serving aunt married to an ambitious rabbi who is a fool and a dupe. He shows, once again, how people can cause the most enormous amount of trouble through stupidity.'</p> <p>It would have been almost impossible, even a decade ago, to have predicted, from the collected evidence of the 20 novels he had then published, the dramatic change of direction that would occur in Philip Roth's work in the late Nineties. By 1995, when Sabbath's Theater appeared, he had already written at least half a dozen great books, most notably The Counterlife, and so staked his claim, alongside Saul Bellow and John Updike, to being one of the three giants of post-war American fiction. 'Updike and Bellow hold their flashlights out into the world, reveal the world as it is now,' he once remarked. 'I dig a hole and shine my flashlight into the hole.'</p> <p>Like Bellow, who came of age on the bruising, unforgiving streets of industrial Chicago, Roth was a city kid, born in Newark, New Jersey, in 1933, to American-born parents, whose own parents were part of the great emigration of European Jews in the 19th century. Roth's Newark, lovingly recreated in The Plot Against America, was the lower-middle-class Weequahic section, which he would later describe as, 'a vibrant, industrial place, but not an arcadia'.</p> <p>There were, Roth has said, only three books in the house when he was growing up, and 'they were given as presents when someone was ill'. His parents nevertheless sent him and his brother to the best high schools in Newark. He went on to study at Bucknell University, then the University of Chicago. What, I ask a somewhat reluctant Aaron Ascher, was Philip Roth like as a child? 'Well, I'd have to say he was a stubborn little boy,' he laughs, 'pretty much like the little boy in the new book. His parents were ordinary, decent people, not very educated but incredibly wise. He went off on his own, though, and they really didn't know what to make of him. They always stood up for him, though, even when they were baffled. They were certainly shocked by the whole Portnoy episode, that's for sure. Then again, we all were.'</p> <p>Portnoy's Complaint was published in 1969, and pitched Roth, then 36, headlong into the mainstream. His first book, Goodbye Columbus, had appeared a decade earlier, and won him the National Book Award for Fiction in 1959. It had brought censure from many in the American Jewish community for its frank depictions of the Jewish hero's sexual longings. But the public commotion over Goodbye Columbus, though, was nothing to the uproar that greeted the publication of Portnoy. The unhinged narrative voice of Roth's neurotic young Jewish protagonist rails against his mother's suffocating attentions, which have made him so insecure and guilt-ridden that he has retreated into a world of elaborate masturbation rituals and forbidden sex with gentile women. 'My wang,' an overwrought Portnoy informs his shrink, 'was all I really had that I could call my own.'</p> <p>Suddenly, not least because of his book's famous scene in which the hero finds a novel and ingenious use for a piece of raw liver, Roth was the most infamous writer in America. 'My overnight notoriety as a sexual freak had become difficult to evade in Manhattan,' he later wrote of his subsequent flight from fame.</p> <p>'It's hard now to convey how scandalous the book was at the time,' recalls Aaron Ascher. 'Suddenly he was called a pornographer, and was being publicly attacked by the rabbis, who were furious with him for traducing the faith. He was attacked on the streets, people spat at him. He had a terrible time. I don't think he cared what they said, but he was stunned by the force of it. As a person, he became reclusive, defensive.'</p> <p>In the Seventies, Roth's fiction grew more ambitious and self-conscious. In the Zuckerman trilogy - The Ghostwriter (1979), Zuckerman Unbound (1981) and The Anatomy Lesson (1983) - his alter-ego, Nathan Zuckerman, progresses from promising young writer to reluctant celebrity, compromised by the trappings of success, besieged by admirers and hangers-on. These books deliberately blurred the boundaries between real life and fiction, a literary trick that Roth still plays on us today. The British comic novelist, Howard Jacobson, alone among the writers I talked to about Roth, prefers the work of the younger, funnier Roth to the big, state-of-the-nation novels of the past few years.</p> <p>'There's a nagging voice inside me that longs for the seriously funny stuff he used to do,' says Jacobson. 'I think we should be careful not to like a writer more when he makes us laugh less. Roth was one of the few, if not the only writer, who made me put the book down because the laughter was exploding in my chest. He's in another mood now. He's taken maturity hard. You feel he's emerged from something.'</p> <p>That something was almost certainly the nervous breakdown that occurred towards the end of his marriage to the English actress Claire Bloom in 1994. The couple were something of a fixture on literary London's dinner-party circuit, renowned for their often two-handed comic routines.</p> <p>Later, though, Roth would attest that he was suffocated by English manners and appalled by the casual anti-Semitism he encountered there. In 1989, he underwent emergency open-heart surgery, which he faced calmly. His brush with mortality did not initially seem to impinge on his writing, or his combative choice of subject matter. In 1990, he wrote a novel called Deception, in which a wildly promiscuous writer called Philip lives with a dowdy, middle-aged, pampered actress called Claire. The manuscript so incensed Bloom that she insisted Roth rename the actress. It was a small victory. Later, she reveals that, among various other acts of treachery, Roth had twice attempted to seduce her daughter's friend.</p> <p>The protracted and messy disintegration of their marriage was laid bare by Bloom in her subsequent memoir, Leaving A Doll's House. She portrayed Roth as a manipulative and cruel tyrant who made her choose between him and her daughter by a previous marriage, Anna, whom he seems to have despised. She chose Roth, and paid dearly for her fidelity. His extreme behaviour towards the end of their marriage - he billed her at $150 an hour for the 600 hours he had supposedly helped her work on scripts, all the while conducting an affair with another woman - was perhaps exacerbated by the anti-depressant Halcion, which he had been prescribed following an unsuccessful knee operation that left him in a lot of pain.</p> <p>Roth later admitted that he was appalled that 'over the years... Miss Bloom's characterisation of me has been taken at face value'. Others, indeed, attest to Roth's lighter side, the writer Hermione Lee once claiming ' he makes people laugh more than anyone else in the world'. Aaron Ascher agrees: 'Philip is the funniest guy I have ever encountered. He rang me recently and recounted how he had finally gone to see the film of The Human Stain. He said that he sneaked into a theatre with his collar pulled up so no one would recognise him. For about 30 minutes, I listened to this monologue on the movie's shortcomings that was hilarious. I mean, the guy could easily have been a successful comedian.'</p> <p>Throughout the domestic upheaval of the early Nineties, Roth continued to write from his secluded house in Connecticut. His depression returned, though, after he finished Operation Shylock, a novel about a man who steals his identity, and, even more revealingly, his Jewish identity.</p> <p>'There is something definably Jewish about Roth's work,' says Jacobson, perhaps getting close to the secret, sacred core of Roth's writing. 'The humour, of course, but also the seriousness, the ethical undertow, that precise, argumentative, picking away at things that makes all great Jewish writers heirs to the Talmud. That deep sense of life's absurdity, too, the notion that ultimately we're just human beings, and we'll soon be dust.'</p> <p>Nowhere is this absurdity more evident than in the outrageous Sabbath's Theater. Deliberately shocking, it follows the last years of Mickey Sabbath, a rampant septuagenarian raging against the dying of the light, his Viagra-assisted erect penis raised in defiance of death, like a middle finger directed at God himself. In one of those unforgettable Rothian scenes, Sabbath actually fucks his late mistress's grave. 'I was trying to present someone who is deep in disorder,' Roth told David Remnick of the New Yorker, 'someone who is repellent.'</p> <p>On the subject of sexual desire, Roth once declared: 'I'll be obsessed when I am 80 exactly as I was when I was 18.' But there is also something darker, and more disturbing, that surfaces from time to time, particularly in his late work. Reviewing Roth's last book, The Dying Animal, Linda Grant noted: 'It is an unspoken rule of literary pages that women are not sent Roth for review... but it has now become apparent to many of Roth's admirers, both male and female, that there is a dark distaste for women, a repugnance that can only be described by the word misogyny. Which is bizarre, because Roth, for all his rages, can be the most humane, empathetic and compassionate of observers.'</p> <p>This perceived misogyny is seen in some circles as Roth's Achilles' heel, the ugly stain on his greatness. Like Bellow and Updike, he belongs to a generation of male authors whose coming of age predates the coming of modern feminism, and who share a tendency to create female characters who are either emasculaters or victims.</p> <p>'One must resist the urge to psychoanalyse,' says Grant, 'or to conflate Roth with his male creations, but the palpable sense of disgust towards the women characters has certainly intensified in these last great books. He has no problem with intellectual women, it's their sexuality that he finds difficult. It's deeply rooted, and almost medieval. But, it's not a defect. It's an element of who he is as a writer, and it does not for me diminish his greatness.'</p> <p>'Nowadays anybody can say or write almost anything, even in prim Sunday newspapers, or what used to be called \"mixed company\",' the literary critic Frank Kermode said, reviewing Sabbath's Theater. \"And consequently the requirement of outrage becomes more difficult to meet. Yet [Roth] meets it.' His talent for provocation, then, may be counted among Roth's great qualities as a writer: his strategy is to shock and startle, outrage and dismay, wake us up once again to the power of words in a culture that misuses and abuses language to the extent that we hardly notice it anymore.</p> <p>In the end, of course, it comes down to words, to Roth's mastery of language, what Howard Jacobson calls 'language in the service of intelligence, thought wrought to sense'. This is what sets his finest writing apart. At best, his words fly off the page, his sentences gathering a momentum that hauls the reader along to a place beyond mere critical appraisal.</p> <p>'There are times when his prose just ignites and roars into life like a match to a boiler,' concludes Linda Grant, 'and you are caught up and carried along in a way that is so rare in this age of novelistic detachment and irony. It's literally breathtaking, and often you are left thinking, this is something, this is really something.'</p> <p><strong>\u00b7</strong> The Plot Against America is published by Jonathan Cape on 7 October</p>",
  "<p>Maureen Dowd rushes into the lobby of the venerable New York Times building in Times Square. 'I'm so sorry,' she mouths. 'You're allowed to say, \"Maureen Dowd arrived half an hour late for our interview,\"' she offers, 'but only if you explain that it was because I got trapped by the Bushworld motorcade - and then Kerry's!' Somewhat exceptionally, George Bush and John Kerry appeared at competing fundraisers that day in midtown Manhattan. Maureen Dowd, the New York Times's star op-ed columnist, and the woman the President once referred to as 'the Cobra', has got caught in the crosstown crossfire.</p> <p>Later that evening, at a cocktail party to celebrate Bushworld, the collection of Dowd's columns, which has been near the top of the Times's bestseller list since it was published a few weeks ago, someone reported that people had booed Bush on Sixth Avenue. 'Really?' Dowd said excitedly, 'that's amazing.' Asked whether he would have done the same, one of her guests replied: 'Oh no, I'm a traditionalist. He's the President of the United States!'</p> <p>Dowd has built her reputation on debunking precisely that sort of reverence. Writing in a paper famous for its respectful voice, Dowd is something of a firebrand, though her touch is light. She seems to be always right without being self-righteous, she's funny without being silly and has turned mischievous commentary into a lethal political weapon.</p> <p>She won a Pulitzer for her columns about the Clinton impeachment, in which she tried, in her own description, 'to change the tone - and I think I had an influence on our editorial pages in this - to be farcical. Like, this is absurd, that you would try to impeach a politician in Washington on the basis of sex'.</p> <p>Dowd wrote an inspired column in which a man, assumed to be Clinton, obsesses about Monica's thong, and turns out, in the last line, to be Ken Starr. 'That's my favourite column I've ever done,' she told me. 'I just thought [Starr's] whole report was like this ridiculous bodice-ripping, heavy-breathing sex novel.'</p> <p>Now Dowd, whose combination of languid wit and va-va-voom hair must unsettle many, has so enraged the Bushes p\u00e8re et fils they have refused to renew her White House press pass. Bushworld is the product of Dowd's singular position: she was the Times's White House correspondent during Bush Senior's presidency, and op-ed columnist for Bush Junior. She has watched what she portrays as a gripping Oedipal drama at close range.</p> <p>'It's funny,' she reflects, 'because when I covered the father, I used to regret that I got to be a White House reporter then because he was a really nice guy and very gracious to me. I wanted someone dark and complicated - a Lyndon Johnson or a Richard Nixon. So then the son gets in and I think, oh no, it's going to be this carbon copy, and why did I get stuck with this flighty, Waspy family for my whole White House tenure? And then, suddenly, it became this amazing cross between Monty Python and Shakespeare.'</p> <p>Unlike other reporters, Dowd asked the Bushes questions about culture and sport, an approach that led them to fear they were being 'put on the couch'. So we learn that W's favourite film of recent times is Saving Private Ryan; that he likes John le Carr\u00e9 because he's 'mainly a history person', revealing a novel grasp of the difference between fact and fiction; and that he refers to Vice-President Dick Cheney simply as 'Vice'.</p> <p>Bushworld is full of brilliant ventriloquism, like the letter from Dick Cheney to the Saudi ambassador that's carefully censored in the manner of an FBI document. Dowd uses effortless irony in support of positive discrimination, suggests 'Furious George', as she calls Bush II, thinks social security is a dating service, and writes of the war in Iraq: 'This administration is the opposite of the movie The Sixth Sense. They don't see any dead people.'</p> <p>What does Dowd see as the greatest threat - the 'Freudian tango' between father and son or the calculating manoeuvres of W's cohorts? 'I thought about this for a long time. I thought, why would a Republican President who's going to war against Saddam not call the only other Republican President who went to war against Saddam? Either to notify him or to ask his advice, especially if it's his beloved father. And then you finally realise it's simple: the answer is that he didn't want to hear what his father had to say because what his father had to say was, do you have an exit strategy? And he didn't.'</p> <p>But 'other people with decade-long subterranean agendas' are, Dowd believes, equally to blame. Dowd was prescient about Cheney. How did she know to look out for him from the start?</p> <p>'What I did was trust my eye,' she explains. 'Dick Cheney wasn't a source of mine, so I came to it on paper, and saw his voting record and I was like, oh my gosh, this is, like, the Vice-Presidential choice! Even conservative Republicans spend a lot of time trying to figure out what happened to Cheney. He had a very, very conservative voting record when he was chosen, but it's that voice that men seem to respond to like a dog whistle - it's like the dean of a private boy's school voice. And there were a lot of columns at the time by guys who said, oh, Cheney's such a great guy. He is an amazing character - he's very Shakespearean.'</p> <p>At one point during what Bush Senior called his 'love-hate relationship' with Maureen Dowd, the President's campaign manager told her that they didn't really see her as the White House reporter for the New York Times. 'We just picture you someplace else,' he said. 'The Chicago Tribune, maybe, or the New York Post. ' Dowd laughs: 'I said, \"You mean because I'm a woman, I'm ethnic, I'm working-class, you think I should be at a working-class paper?\" And he goes, \"Yeah, I guess that's it.\"'</p> <p>Maureen Dowd is an Irish-Catholic, the youngest of five children, who grew up in Washington DC (she is 52). Her father was a DC police inspector in charge of security at the Senate, and her three older brothers worked as Senate pages in their youth. Her first memory, she tells me, was of the Capitol building. She began her journalistic career as a copytaker at the Washington Star. She became a reporter there and, when it folded, she moved to Time magazine. In 1983, she joined the New York Times as a reporter and has been at the paper ever since.</p> <p>Dowd believes she has been influenced by her father's White House sensibilities. 'He would judge politicians by whether they were phonies or not,' she explains. 'Like sometimes politicians would ask him to take constituents to lunch, but then not give him the money to pay for it, and that would be a phony. It didn't matter if it was a Democrat or a Republican. He loved the Kennedys - we grew up with a huge picture of JFK in his den. But Nixon was the nice guy at Capitol Hill. He was really nice to my dad and to my brothers, and Kennedy was sort of snooty. He wouldn't talk to my brother when he delivered the mail. In fact, my brother said you were told not to address Kennedy or look at him. So I learned to judge more on what kind of person they are, rather than having one party and sticking to it.'</p> <p>Her family now thinks 'all the Bushes are swell', as she put it in the book's dedication to her mother. 'None of my family has ever asked what I thought about politics in my whole life,' Dowd tells me. 'And they have not acknowledged there's a book. But they all came to the book party and were the first to come and the last to leave!'</p> <p>Dowd has described herself as an 'equal-opportunity sceptic', and she is certainly as informedly sceptical about Hillary Clinton as she is about George Bush. But I wonder if this leaves her with few causes she feels she absolutely has to fight for.</p> <p>'I don't know,' Dowd muses. 'I did some columns about when my niece gave my brother half of her liver and saved his life last year. I would love to do more stuff like that. And my mom says, \"You should do some more nice columns.\" But I do tend to get caught up in thinking, well, these guys have a bunch of people on the taxpayer's dime, who are putting stuff out there that is misleading. Like the Iraq war - we were misled into that war. So it's a really good time for journalists to be sceptical. Journalists are an important part of checks and balances. If it's negative,' she concludes, 'well, so is making up stuff to go to war.'</p>",
  "David Blunkett increasingly fills the Dr Strangelove role in Tony Blair's government. Last week he gave an odd interview to the Guardian in which he offered himself as the Prime Minister's lightning conductor in the run-up to the election (Ja, ja, Mr President, let ze bombs rain down on me). He moved on to the subject of political apathy: 'People are dis-engaged because the world has changed so rapidly. That change causes greater insecurity and fearfulness, which reinforces alienation from the process of politics and from coping with change.' <p>The Strangelove analysis, naturally enough, did not dwell on the war - the government's failure to take notice of the vast anti-war movement and the unfolding disaster of Iraq which so many predicted, including, we know now, the most senior members of the Foreign Office. Neither did he refer to the corruption of the political discourse - the lies and manipulations which have so distorted debate in this country and were responsible for forcing the war on us. </p> <p>The electorate's disengagement, of course, has nothing to do with fear or people's lack of adaptability. </p> <p>It's just that we've been misled too often since Blair came to power and lied to on the most important foreign policy issue for the past 15 years. We understand that Labour is not going to bring the Prime Minister to book and that the party itself will never admit that the majority vote for war was an absolute calamity, so, yes, we think of something else. </p> <p>But this is not fear, Mr Blunkett, it's contempt and frustration. </p> <p>Blunkett's interview was not without value, because it underlined New Labour's tendency to pass the blame from the government to the electorate. If it's not the media's fault, they always blame the people. When hospitals founder and schools and transport systems do not meet the targets set at a more optimistic moment, the Prime Minister criticises the resistance and sluggishness of Britain's public service culture. </p> <p>Indeed, there is sometimes a sense that New Labour really doesn't much like the public and distrusts its addiction to tradition, which is presumably why the Prime Minister's office terminated the centuries-old post of Lord Chancellor by fax. Blair apparently has very little sense of history or the value of what's gone before, which I'm beginning to think is evidence of supreme egotism. </p> <p>After he became party leader, I did a series of interviews with him in his Islington home. It is the only time I've met him and I was struck by how likeable he was and how recognisably a part of my generation (we were born three weeks apart). Listening to the tapes now, I see that there is both certainty and shallowness in his deliberations. He was good at reeling off a list of policies without going into much detail. </p> <p>What I didn't understand then was that his faith in the programme of modernisation neatly replaced all the cumbersome requirements of a socialist ideology and gave him much more flexibility when he became Prime Minister. He could pick and choose the parts of the British constitution he wished to preserve and support. While he seems to rub along with the Queen perfectly well, he has a demonstrable lack of interest for Parliament. He has ignored the Commons often, has botched reform of the Lords, and has wrenched power away from his cabinet to a trusted inner circle at Number 10. </p> <p>There is also a surprisingly authoritarian streak in his nature, which I didn't spot in the Nineties. He appears to be relaxed on what one might call social freedoms - drinking and gambling laws, for instance - but is happy to preside over the restriction of important civil liberties. Anti-terrorism legislation has been used to lock up people without trial and arrest those demonstrating against the war outside airbases. </p> <p>Blair gets away with all this because he doesn't have to answer to anyone, even on the great issues of what to do in Iraq as terrorist cells now take root in the open wound like so many spores of MRSA. Most of those against the war concede that 90 per cent of Iraqis are glad to be rid of Saddam, but we were told this war was fought on a pretext of security, not regime change. </p> <p>Where there was once no terrorist problem, there is the gravest possible threat to Middle Eastern stability. The long-term preservation of the Saudi regime, one of the hidden motives, or at least collateral aims, of the US strategy, seems much less likely now there is a full-scale Islamist insurrection on its northern border. Iran is using this opportunity to test the will of both the UN and the West with its programme of nuclear development, in the belief that we don't have the stomach for a second confrontation. </p> <p>We are in trouble; the Middle East is in trouble. But so far Blair offers not the slightest apology or explanation. Neither is he particularly explicit about future strategy. It is plain that we cannot - and should not - leave the mess we have created, but how long are British troops going to be exposed in Basra? What will Blair do if the Iraqi elections in January are postponed or made unworkable by terrorist attacks? </p> <p>The Prime Minister has survived the Hutton and Butler reports, although a close reading of both leads you to have no doubt about his personality and the way Number 10 operates. It is a story of absolute power concentrated in a small number of individuals, most unelected, who ride rough-shod over the Labour Party, which now, incidentally, seems little more than the midwife to Blair's ambition. </p> <p>Yet Labour is ultimately responsible for Blair. There are many good people, such as Robin Cook, who saw what was going to happen in Iraq, but they have been unable to bring the party to focus on the enormous harm that has been done. The majority is still in the Prime Minister's thrall, to his power and apparent electability. </p> <p>Their duty, however, is much wider than many grasp. Imagine for one moment that Blair was deposed solely on the grounds of the Iraqi debacle. The damage inflicted on Bush in the run-up to the US election would be considerable, given the situation in Iraq. Surely this is something any good Labour member must want. Or has Blair skewed the party's judgment so much that it can't think straight on the actual nature of the Bush administration? </p> <p>The world needs to find a new coherence, reason and unity to fight the great evil which has arisen in Islam and that will not be done with Bush or Blair in power. We must hope that the Labour Party comes to its senses and removes Blair as soon as possible. He has nothing more to offer and, sooner or later, the electorate is going to see him for what he is - and the Labour Party will pay for it. </p> <p>But, there again, maybe they think Charles Kennedy deserves a chance.</p>",
  "<p>Bernie Ecclestone, Lakshmi Mittal, Paul Grayson: Labour has been so effective at snuggling up to business since 1997 that it has managed to get itself embroiled in the kinds of cash-for-access scandals that were once the preserve of the Tory party. </p> <p>Winning over doubters in the business world was key to the long, slow transformation that brought Labour into power: but with another election just months away, the government can no longer take the confidence of the money men for granted. </p> <p>It started with seafood. 'Never have so many crustaceans died in vain,' Michael Heseltine quipped at the height of then shadow chancellor John Smith's 'prawn cocktail offensive', in which he whirled around the Square Mile trying to convince traditionally Tory-supporting bankers, brokers and directors that he wouldn't threaten their prosperity. Labour went on to lose its fourth successive election in 1992, stung by Tory charges that it was about to drop a 'tax bomb' on middle England. </p> <p>But that was before Black Wednesday, in September that year, when Norman Lamont ramped up interest rates to 15 per cent in a vain attempt to prop up the pound against the Deutschmark, and wiped out the Tories' hard-won reputation for economic management at a stroke. Labour was handed the opportunity it had longed for, to take over as the party business could trust. </p> <p>Handing independence to the Bank of England as soon as he arrived in the Treasury in May 1997 is still viewed as Gordon Brown's master-stroke, bringing him an immediate credibility windfall, as the markets bet that borrowing costs would probably be lower once rate-setting was divorced from politics. </p> <p>Stephen Alambritis, spokesman for the Federation of Small Businesses, says Brown is still reaping the political benefits of that early decision, and the stable economic environment it helped to create. 'There is a concern about the cumulative effects of regulation, but that is being cushioned by the low interest rates,' he says. </p> <p> Graeme Leach, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, agrees. 'On the economic policy front, his best decision was his first decision,' he says. </p> <p>Over time, though, businesses have begun to take the more stable macroeconomic framework for granted, and quibbles about Labour's interventionist policies in other areas have begun to get louder. 'It's a very regulating government, it's a very interfering government,' says Digby Jones, director-general of the CBI. 'They regulate first, and they ask questions second. I wish occasionally they would reward ministers for doing nothing. That would be refreshing!' </p> <p>Leach at the IoD agrees. 'Survey after survey of our members shows that regulation is a major issue. And Brown's tax and spend policy is the wrong way around - you've got to get the system working effectively first; then you put more money in.' </p> <p>'Tax and spend' is a label the Brown Treasury has fought hard to avoid. It was very proud of the public consensus it consciously tried to build in the run-up to the 2002 Budget - that improving the NHS was a goal worth paying extra for. But the consensus never really stretched as far as businesses. </p> <p>The CBI and other groups reacted angrily to the announcement that firms' national insurance contributions would rise. They thought they had a close working relationship with the Treasury, and were delighted with measures such as research and development tax credits; but the \u00a34 billion rise in employer NICs came as a bolt from the blue. Iain Vallance, the outgoing CBI president, accused Labour at the time of 'cutting open the goose that lays the golden egg'. </p> <p>'Too much red tape' has long been a gripe of businesses, but Ruth Lea, of the right-wing Centre for Policy Studies, says firms don't like being used as tools to further other government aims. </p> <p>She singles out Trade and Industry Secretary Patricia Hewitt, who mooted the idea of a year's paid statutory maternity leave last Monday. 'The gloves are off,' Lea says. 'Whatever [Hewitt] might have said in the past, what she's really about is social engineering.' </p> <p>Martin Temple, director-general of the Engineering Employers' Federation, is also concerned about the weight of legislation on his members, many of whom are small businesses. 'The economy has been better than we expected, but the cost of government has been an issue, and remains an issue.' He points to energy costs, employment legislation and pensions as areas for complaint. </p> <p>Pensions policy has become a political minefield for Brown. With the dotcom boom in full swing, his decision in 1997 to prevent pension funds from claiming back the tax they paid on share dividends elicited barely a whimper from the markets. Its laudable aim was to persuade companies to reinvest their profits, instead of facing pressure from shareholders to pay them out as dividends. </p> <p>But once the market started to turn down, opening up giant black holes in many corporate pension funds, things looked very different. City investors now blame the \u00a35bn-a-year increase in pen sion funds' tax bills for exacerbating the funding shortfalls in many of Britain's corporate pension funds - and the lacklustre performance of the FTSE in recent years. </p> <p>Vince Cable, the Lib-Dem Treasury spokesman, says pensions policy, and in particular the removal of tax relief, is at the heart of City suspicions about Labour. 'It was a catalyst,' he says. 'What stuck in the craw was the spectacular naivete that the stock market bubble would go on for ever and they could just take money out of it.' </p> <p>Now, he says, 'there are massive worries about long-term pensions. I think there's a feeling that the current system isn't working, and can't be made to work.' </p> <p>The complex system of means-tested benefits for the elderly is aimed at giving most help to the poorest; but the financial institutions complain that it discourages saving, and consumers don't understand how it works. </p> <p>Beefed-up City regulation, led by the FSA, is another bugbear. When the Bank of England was in charge of banking regulation, it was seen as batting for the City, giving it a voice in government. The FSA is seen as meddling. 'It's a very, very intrusive regime,' says one City analyst. Callum McCarthy, the FSA's chairman, received a less-than-warm reception when he addressed the City banquet at the Mansion House last week. </p> <p>Notwithstanding the long list of niggles, however, there are still two great bulwarks that have prevented Labour's business support from ebbing away. The first is the strong, stable performance of the economy: unemployment remains at its lowest level for a generation, and Brown avoided the recessions that hit the US and much of the eurozone after the post 11 September stock market crash. </p> <p>More important, though, is the fact that the Tories still aren't seen as fully credible. Appointing a 'shadow secretary of state for deregulation' is an attempt to tap into business anxieties about Labour; but John Redwood is not the most hard-hitting political performer. And until the Tories can promise business a regime they think would be more to their advantage, they're unlikely to swing their weight - and their cash - behind electing Howard and his team. </p> <p>As one insider put it when asked about the City's relationship with Labour last week: 'The honeymoon finished long ago. We've had the divorce, but it's being followed by a long period of celibacy.'</p> <p><strong>How six key Number 11 decisions went down with business</strong></p> <p><strong>May 1997:</strong> Bank of England independence. Brown hands power to set interest rates to a new Monetary Policy Committee. </p> <p><strong>Business verdict:</strong> Universal applause. Independent monetary policy is seen as one of the key factors that has underpinned the economy since 1997.</p> <p><strong>July 1997:</strong> In his first full Budget, Brown announces that pension funds will no longer be able to reclaim tax on share dividends. </p> <p><strong>Business verdict:</strong> At the time, indifference; more recently, fury. The \u00a35 billion-a-year extra cost is blamed for exacerbating what has become known as the 'pensions crisis'. But the Treasury points out it was part of a pro-business package that also included a 2 per cent cut in corporation tax.</p> <p><strong>April 1999:</strong> National minimum wage comes into force. </p> <p><strong>Business verdict:</strong> Suspicion, giving way to relief. Predictions of resultant job losses fail to materialise, partly because the wage is set lower than unions had hoped, at \u00a33.60. The Tories later drop their opposition to a minimum wage, underlining the fact that it has been seen as a success.</p> <p><strong>April 2000:</strong> Firms become responsible for administering the government's working families tax credit through the payroll. </p> <p><strong>Business verdict:</strong> Irritation at the extra costs involved. The Treasury later rescinds the decision, but the Institute of Directors says: 'It would have been better if it had never been introduced in the first place. Employers are going to have to pay significant amounts of money to amend their payroll systems yet again.'</p> <p><strong>April 2002:</strong> Employers' national insur ance contributions increase by 1 per cent as part of a tax-raising package aimed at pouring more money into the NHS. </p> <p><strong>Business verdict:</strong> Horror, giving way to resignation. Companies agree that Britain's crumbling infrastructure is in need of investment, but they hadn't planned on paying for it themselves.</p> <p><strong>Summer 2004:</strong> The government suggests that Crossrail, the long-delayed transport link through the centre of London, could finally go ahead - but only if business will stump up some of the cash. </p> <p><strong>Business verdict:</strong> Sceptical approval. The overcrowded transport infrastructure is widely seen as one of the major barriers to running a business in Britain; London mayor Ken Livingstone gets a big cheer at the City banquet for backing the line.</p>",
  "<p>Maureen Dowd rushes into the lobby of the venerable New York Times building in Times Square. 'I'm so sorry,' she mouths. 'You're allowed to say, \"Maureen Dowd arrived half an hour late for our interview,\"' she offers, 'but only if you explain that it was because I got trapped by the Bushworld motorcade - and then Kerry's!' Somewhat exceptionally, George Bush and John Kerry appeared at competing fundraisers that day in midtown Manhattan. Maureen Dowd, the New York Times's star op-ed columnist, and the woman the President once referred to as 'the Cobra', has got caught in the crosstown crossfire.</p> <p>Later that evening, at a cocktail party to celebrate Bushworld, the collection of Dowd's columns, which has been near the top of the Times's bestseller list since it was published a few weeks ago, someone reported that people had booed Bush on Sixth Avenue. 'Really?' Dowd said excitedly, 'that's amazing.' Asked whether he would have done the same, one of her guests replied: 'Oh no, I'm a traditionalist. He's the President of the United States!'</p> <p>Dowd has built her reputation on debunking precisely that sort of reverence. Writing in a paper famous for its respectful voice, Dowd is something of a firebrand, though her touch is light. She seems to be always right without being self-righteous, she's funny without being silly and has turned mischievous commentary into a lethal political weapon.</p> <p>She won a Pulitzer for her columns about the Clinton impeachment, in which she tried, in her own description, 'to change the tone - and I think I had an influence on our editorial pages in this - to be farcical. Like, this is absurd, that you would try to impeach a politician in Washington on the basis of sex'.</p> <p>Dowd wrote an inspired column in which a man, assumed to be Clinton, obsesses about Monica's thong, and turns out, in the last line, to be Ken Starr. 'That's my favourite column I've ever done,' she told me. 'I just thought [Starr's] whole report was like this ridiculous bodice-ripping, heavy-breathing sex novel.'</p> <p>Now Dowd, whose combination of languid wit and va-va-voom hair must unsettle many, has so enraged the Bushes p\u00e8re et fils they have refused to renew her White House press pass. Bushworld is the product of Dowd's singular position: she was the Times's White House correspondent during Bush Senior's presidency, and op-ed columnist for Bush Junior. She has watched what she portrays as a gripping Oedipal drama at close range.</p> <p>'It's funny,' she reflects, 'because when I covered the father, I used to regret that I got to be a White House reporter then because he was a really nice guy and very gracious to me. I wanted someone dark and complicated - a Lyndon Johnson or a Richard Nixon. So then the son gets in and I think, oh no, it's going to be this carbon copy, and why did I get stuck with this flighty, Waspy family for my whole White House tenure? And then, suddenly, it became this amazing cross between Monty Python and Shakespeare.'</p> <p>Unlike other reporters, Dowd asked the Bushes questions about culture and sport, an approach that led them to fear they were being 'put on the couch'. So we learn that W's favourite film of recent times is Saving Private Ryan; that he likes John le Carr\u00e9 because he's 'mainly a history person', revealing a novel grasp of the difference between fact and fiction; and that he refers to Vice-President Dick Cheney simply as 'Vice'.</p> <p>Bushworld is full of brilliant ventriloquism, like the letter from Dick Cheney to the Saudi ambassador that's carefully censored in the manner of an FBI document. Dowd uses effortless irony in support of positive discrimination, suggests 'Furious George', as she calls Bush II, thinks social security is a dating service, and writes of the war in Iraq: 'This administration is the opposite of the movie The Sixth Sense. They don't see any dead people.'</p> <p>What does Dowd see as the greatest threat - the 'Freudian tango' between father and son or the calculating manoeuvres of W's cohorts? 'I thought about this for a long time. I thought, why would a Republican President who's going to war against Saddam not call the only other Republican President who went to war against Saddam? Either to notify him or to ask his advice, especially if it's his beloved father. And then you finally realise it's simple: the answer is that he didn't want to hear what his father had to say because what his father had to say was, do you have an exit strategy? And he didn't.'</p> <p>But 'other people with decade-long subterranean agendas' are, Dowd believes, equally to blame. Dowd was prescient about Cheney. How did she know to look out for him from the start?</p> <p>'What I did was trust my eye,' she explains. 'Dick Cheney wasn't a source of mine, so I came to it on paper, and saw his voting record and I was like, oh my gosh, this is, like, the Vice-Presidential choice! Even conservative Republicans spend a lot of time trying to figure out what happened to Cheney. He had a very, very conservative voting record when he was chosen, but it's that voice that men seem to respond to like a dog whistle - it's like the dean of a private boy's school voice. And there were a lot of columns at the time by guys who said, oh, Cheney's such a great guy. He is an amazing character - he's very Shakespearean.'</p> <p>At one point during what Bush Senior called his 'love-hate relationship' with Maureen Dowd, the President's campaign manager told her that they didn't really see her as the White House reporter for the New York Times. 'We just picture you someplace else,' he said. 'The Chicago Tribune, maybe, or the New York Post. ' Dowd laughs: 'I said, \"You mean because I'm a woman, I'm ethnic, I'm working-class, you think I should be at a working-class paper?\" And he goes, \"Yeah, I guess that's it.\"'</p> <p>Maureen Dowd is an Irish-Catholic, the youngest of five children, who grew up in Washington DC (she is 52). Her father was a DC police inspector in charge of security at the Senate, and her three older brothers worked as Senate pages in their youth. Her first memory, she tells me, was of the Capitol building. She began her journalistic career as a copytaker at the Washington Star. She became a reporter there and, when it folded, she moved to Time magazine. In 1983, she joined the New York Times as a reporter and has been at the paper ever since.</p> <p>Dowd believes she has been influenced by her father's White House sensibilities. 'He would judge politicians by whether they were phonies or not,' she explains. 'Like sometimes politicians would ask him to take constituents to lunch, but then not give him the money to pay for it, and that would be a phony. It didn't matter if it was a Democrat or a Republican. He loved the Kennedys - we grew up with a huge picture of JFK in his den. But Nixon was the nice guy at Capitol Hill. He was really nice to my dad and to my brothers, and Kennedy was sort of snooty. He wouldn't talk to my brother when he delivered the mail. In fact, my brother said you were told not to address Kennedy or look at him. So I learned to judge more on what kind of person they are, rather than having one party and sticking to it.'</p> <p>Her family now thinks 'all the Bushes are swell', as she put it in the book's dedication to her mother. 'None of my family has ever asked what I thought about politics in my whole life,' Dowd tells me. 'And they have not acknowledged there's a book. But they all came to the book party and were the first to come and the last to leave!'</p> <p>Dowd has described herself as an 'equal-opportunity sceptic', and she is certainly as informedly sceptical about Hillary Clinton as she is about George Bush. But I wonder if this leaves her with few causes she feels she absolutely has to fight for.</p> <p>'I don't know,' Dowd muses. 'I did some columns about when my niece gave my brother half of her liver and saved his life last year. I would love to do more stuff like that. And my mom says, \"You should do some more nice columns.\" But I do tend to get caught up in thinking, well, these guys have a bunch of people on the taxpayer's dime, who are putting stuff out there that is misleading. Like the Iraq war - we were misled into that war. So it's a really good time for journalists to be sceptical. Journalists are an important part of checks and balances. If it's negative,' she concludes, 'well, so is making up stuff to go to war.'</p>",
  "<p>Stock markets have been treading water for most of the year, trading within a very narrow range with the exception of the Far East. Investors have paid the price for an over-zealous performance in the second half of 2003 after the Iraq war, when prices overstepped the mark. </p> <p>After a brisk start to the year, global indices have been running about like headless chickens for three reasons: The constant threat of geopolitical sabre-rattling; the extortionate cost of crude oil; and GDP throughout the world failing to live up to expectations - particularly in the US, where it was anticipated it would come in at 6 per cent for the first quarter. It has recently been adjusted to 2.8 per cent. Sadly the rest of the world has fed off this factor. </p> <p>Historically the run-up to the presidential election often sees shares have a decent run. Initially it generally does not matter who wins, it's a question of getting the choice of sectors right. Japan's Nikkei offers possibly the greatest opportunity of making ground by the end of the year. Though volatile there are certain sectors - banks, which have seen radical surgery, car and tech stocks - that offer serious value. </p> <p>Doubts about growth and cracks in the quality of the third-quarter earnings in the US are beginning to appear. However, there is some robustness to the economy and a re-elected or new President could provide a stimulus for equities. </p> <p>Germany's DAX suggests little growth with some tech stocks possibly offering a satisfactory denouement to the year. As for the FTSE, banks, drugs and telecoms, which constitute nearly 50 per cent of this index, have underperformed the market this year. There is little reason why their performance should significantly improve between now and 2005. However largesse could be deracinated from a flurry of M&amp;A activity.</p>",

  "George Bush's grandfather, the late US senator Prescott Bush, was a director and shareholder of companies that profited from their involvement with the financial backers of Nazi Germany. <p>The Guardian has obtained confirmation from newly discovered files in the US National Archives that a firm of which Prescott Bush was a director was involved with the financial architects of Nazism. </p> <p>His business dealings, which continued until his company's assets were seized in 1942 under the Trading with the Enemy Act, has led more than 60 years later to a civil action for damages being brought in Germany against the Bush family by two former slave labourers at Auschwitz and to a hum of pre-election controversy. </p> <p>The evidence has also prompted one former US Nazi war crimes prosecutor to argue that the late senator's action should have been grounds for prosecution for giving aid and comfort to the enemy. </p> <p>The debate over Prescott Bush's behaviour has been bubbling under the surface for some time. There has been a steady internet chatter about the \"Bush/Nazi\" connection, much of it inaccurate and unfair. But the new documents, many of which were only declassified last year, show that even after America had entered the war and when there was already significant information about the Nazis' plans and policies, he worked for and profited from companies closely involved with the very German businesses that financed Hitler's rise to power. It has also been suggested that the money he made from these dealings helped to establish the Bush family fortune and set up its political dynasty. </p> <p>Remarkably, little of Bush's dealings with Germany has received public scrutiny, partly because of the secret status of the documentation involving him. But now the multibillion dollar legal action for damages by two Holocaust survivors against the Bush family, and the imminent publication of three books on the subject are threatening to make Prescott Bush's business history an uncomfortable issue for his grandson, George W, as he seeks re-election. </p> <p>While there is no suggestion that Prescott Bush was sympathetic to the Nazi cause, the documents reveal that the firm he worked for, Brown Brothers Harriman (BBH), acted as a US base for the German industrialist, Fritz Thyssen, who helped finance Hitler in the 1930s before falling out with him at the end of the decade. The Guardian has seen evidence that shows Bush was the director of the New York-based Union Banking Corporation (UBC) that represented Thyssen's US interests and he continued to work for the bank after America entered the war. </p> <p><b> Tantalising</b><br> </p> <p> Bush was also on the board of at least one of the companies that formed part of a multinational network of front companies to allow Thyssen to move assets around the world. </p> <p>Thyssen owned the largest steel and coal company in Germany and grew rich from Hitler's efforts to re-arm between the two world wars. One of the pillars in Thyssen's international corporate web, UBC, worked exclusively for, and was owned by, a Thyssen-controlled bank in the Netherlands. More tantalising are Bush's links to the Consolidated Silesian Steel Company (CSSC), based in mineral rich Silesia on the German-Polish border. During the war, the company made use of Nazi slave labour from the concentration camps, including Auschwitz. The ownership of CSSC changed hands several times in the 1930s, but documents from the US National Archive declassified last year link Bush to CSSC, although it is not clear if he and UBC were still involved in the company when Thyssen's American assets were seized in 1942. </p> <p>Three sets of archives spell out Prescott Bush's involvement. All three are readily available, thanks to the efficient US archive system and a helpful and dedicated staff at both the Library of Congress in Washington and the National Archives at the University of Maryland. </p> <p>The first set of files, the Harriman papers in the Library of Congress, show that Prescott Bush was a director and shareholder of a number of companies involved with Thyssen. </p> <p>The second set of papers, which are in the National Archives, are contained in vesting order number 248 which records the seizure of the company assets. What these files show is that on October 20 1942 the alien property custodian seized the assets of the UBC, of which Prescott Bush was a director. Having gone through the books of the bank, further seizures were made against two affiliates, the Holland-American Trading Corporation and the Seamless Steel Equipment Corporation. By November, the Silesian-American Company, another of Prescott Bush's ventures, had also been seized. </p> <p>The third set of documents, also at the National Archives, are contained in the files on IG Farben, who was prosecuted for war crimes. </p> <p>A report issued by the Office of Alien Property Custodian in 1942 stated of the companies that \"since 1939, these (steel and mining) properties have been in possession of and have been operated by the German government and have undoubtedly been of considerable assistance to that country's war effort\". </p> <p>Prescott Bush, a 6ft 4in charmer with a rich singing voice, was the founder of the Bush political dynasty and was once considered a potential presidential candidate himself. Like his son, George, and grandson, George W, he went to Yale where he was, again like his descendants, a member of the secretive and influential Skull and Bones student society. He was an artillery captain in the first world war and married Dorothy Walker, the daughter of George Herbert Walker, in 1921. </p> <p>In 1924, his father-in-law, a well-known St Louis investment banker, helped set him up in business in New York with Averill Harriman, the wealthy son of railroad magnate E H Harriman in New York, who had gone into banking. </p> <p>One of the first jobs Walker gave Bush was to manage UBC. Bush was a founding member of the bank and the incorporation documents, which list him as one of seven directors, show he owned one share in UBC worth $125. </p> <p>The bank was set up by Harriman and Bush's father-in-law to provide a US bank for the Thyssens, Germany's most powerful industrial family. </p> <p>August Thyssen, the founder of the dynasty had been a major contributor to Germany's first world war effort and in the 1920s, he and his sons Fritz and Heinrich established a network of overseas banks and companies so their assets and money could be whisked offshore if threatened again. </p> <p>By the time Fritz Thyssen inherited the business empire in 1926, Germany's economic recovery was faltering. After hearing Adolf Hitler speak, Thyssen became mesmerised by the young firebrand. He joined the Nazi party in December 1931 and admits backing Hitler in his autobiography, I Paid Hitler, when the National Socialists were still a radical fringe party. He stepped in several times to bail out the struggling party: in 1928 Thyssen had bought the Barlow Palace on Briennerstrasse, in Munich, which Hitler converted into the Brown House, the headquarters of the Nazi party. The money came from another Thyssen overseas institution, the Bank voor Handel en Scheepvarrt in Rotterdam. </p> <p>By the late 1930s, Brown Brothers Harriman, which claimed to be the world's largest private investment bank, and UBC had bought and shipped millions of dollars of gold, fuel, steel, coal and US treasury bonds to Germany, both feeding and financing Hitler's build-up to war. </p> <p>Between 1931 and 1933 UBC bought more than $8m worth of gold, of which $3m was shipped abroad. According to documents seen by the Guardian, after UBC was set up it transferred $2m to BBH accounts and between 1924 and 1940 the assets of UBC hovered around $3m, dropping to $1m only on a few occasions. </p> <p>In 1941, Thyssen fled Germany after falling out with Hitler but he was captured in France and detained for the remainder of the war. </p> <p>There was nothing illegal in doing business with the Thyssens throughout the 1930s and many of America's best-known business names invested heavily in the German economic recovery. However, everything changed after Germany invaded Poland in 1939. Even then it could be argued that BBH was within its rights continuing business relations with the Thyssens until the end of 1941 as the US was still technically neutral until the attack on Pearl Harbor. The trouble started on July 30 1942 when the New York Herald-Tribune ran an article entitled \"Hitler's Angel Has $3m in US Bank\". UBC's huge gold purchases had raised suspicions that the bank was in fact a \"secret nest egg\" hidden in New York for Thyssen and other Nazi bigwigs. The Alien Property Commission (APC) launched an investigation. </p> <p>There is no dispute over the fact that the US government seized a string of assets controlled by BBH - including UBC and SAC - in the autumn of 1942 under the Trading with the Enemy act. What is in dispute is if Harriman, Walker and Bush did more than own these companies on paper. </p> <p>Erwin May, a treasury attache and officer for the department of investigation in the APC, was assigned to look into UBC's business. The first fact to emerge was that Roland Harriman, Prescott Bush and the other directors didn't actually own their shares in UBC but merely held them on behalf of Bank voor Handel. Strangely, no one seemed to know who owned the Rotterdam-based bank, including UBC's president. </p> <p>May wrote in his report of August 16 1941: \"Union Banking Corporation, incorporated August 4 1924, is wholly owned by the Bank voor Handel en Scheepvaart N.V of Rotterdam, the Netherlands. My investigation has produced no evidence as to the ownership of the Dutch bank. Mr Cornelis [sic] Lievense, president of UBC, claims no knowledge as to the ownership of the Bank voor Handel but believes it possible that Baron Heinrich Thyssen, brother of Fritz Thyssen, may own a substantial interest.\" </p> <p>May cleared the bank of holding a golden nest egg for the Nazi leaders but went on to describe a network of companies spreading out from UBC across Europe, America and Canada, and how money from voor Handel travelled to these companies through UBC. </p> <p>By September May had traced the origins of the non-American board members and found that Dutchman HJ Kouwenhoven - who met with Harriman in 1924 to set up UBC - had several other jobs: in addition to being the managing director of voor Handel he was also the director of the August Thyssen bank in Berlin and a director of Fritz Thyssen's Union Steel Works, the holding company that controlled Thyssen's steel and coal mine empire in Germany. </p> <p>Within a few weeks, Homer Jones, the chief of the APC investigation and research division sent a memo to the executive committee of APC recommending the US government vest UBC and its assets. Jones named the directors of the bank in the memo, including Prescott Bush's name, and wrote: \"Said stock is held by the above named individuals, however, solely as nominees for the Bank voor Handel, Rotterdam, Holland, which is owned by one or more of the Thyssen family, nationals of Germany and Hungary. The 4,000 shares hereinbefore set out are therefore beneficially owned and help for the interests of enemy nationals, and are vestible by the APC,\" according to the memo from the National Archives seen by the Guardian. </p> <p><b> Red-handed</b><br> </p> <p>Jones recommended that the assets be liquidated for the benefit of the government, but instead UBC was maintained intact and eventually returned to the American shareholders after the war. Some claim that Bush sold his share in UBC after the war for $1.5m - a huge amount of money at the time - but there is no documentary evidence to support this claim. No further action was ever taken nor was the investigation continued, despite the fact UBC was caught red-handed operating a American shell company for the Thyssen family eight months after America had entered the war and that this was the bank that had partly financed Hitler's rise to power. </p> <p>The most tantalising part of the story remains shrouded in mystery: the connection, if any, between Prescott Bush, Thyssen, Consolidated Silesian Steel Company (CSSC) and Auschwitz. </p> <p>Thyssen's partner in United Steel Works, which had coal mines and steel plants across the region, was Friedrich Flick, another steel magnate who also owned part of IG Farben, the powerful German chemical company. </p> <p>Flick's plants in Poland made heavy use of slave labour from the concentration camps in Poland. According to a New York Times article published in March 18 1934 Flick owned two-thirds of CSSC while \"American interests\" held the rest. </p> <p>The US National Archive documents show that BBH's involvement with CSSC was more than simply holding the shares in the mid-1930s. Bush's friend and fellow \"bonesman\" Knight Woolley, another partner at BBH, wrote to Averill Harriman in January 1933 warning of problems with CSSC after the Poles started their drive to nationalise the plant. \"The Consolidated Silesian Steel Company situation has become increasingly complicated, and I have accordingly brought in Sullivan and Cromwell, in order to be sure that our interests are protected,\" wrote Knight. \"After studying the situation Foster Dulles is insisting that their man in Berlin get into the picture and obtain the information which the directors here should have. You will recall that Foster is a director and he is particularly anxious to be certain that there is no liability attaching to the American directors.\" </p> <p>But the ownership of the CSSC between 1939 when the Germans invaded Poland and 1942 when the US government vested UBC and SAC is not clear. </p> <p>\"SAC held coal mines and definitely owned CSSC between 1934 and 1935, but when SAC was vested there was no trace of CSSC. All concrete evidence of its ownership disappears after 1935 and there are only a few traces in 1938 and 1939,\" says Eva Schweitzer, the journalist and author whose book, America and the Holocaust, is published next month. </p> <p>Silesia was quickly made part of the German Reich after the invasion, but while Polish factories were seized by the Nazis, those belonging to the still neutral Americans (and some other nationals) were treated more carefully as Hitler was still hoping to persuade the US to at least sit out the war as a neutral country. Schweitzer says American interests were dealt with on a case-by-case basis. The Nazis bought some out, but not others. </p> <p>The two Holocaust survivors suing the US government and the Bush family for a total of $40bn in compensation claim both materially benefited from Auschwitz slave labour during the second world war. </p> <p>Kurt Julius Goldstein, 87, and Peter Gingold, 85, began a class action in America in 2001, but the case was thrown out by Judge Rosemary Collier on the grounds that the government cannot be held liable under the principle of \"state sovereignty\". </p> <p>Jan Lissmann, one of the lawyers for the survivors, said: \"President Bush withdrew President Bill Clinton's signature from the treaty [that founded the court] not only to protect Americans, but also to protect himself and his family.\" </p> <p>Lissmann argues that genocide-related cases are covered by international law, which does hold governments accountable for their actions. He claims the ruling was invalid as no hearing took place. </p> <p>In their claims, Mr Goldstein and Mr Gingold, honorary chairman of the League of Anti-fascists, suggest the Americans were aware of what was happening at Auschwitz and should have bombed the camp. </p> <p>The lawyers also filed a motion in The Hague asking for an opinion on whether state sovereignty is a valid reason for refusing to hear their case. A ruling is expected within a month. </p> <p>The petition to The Hague states: \"From April 1944 on, the American Air Force could have destroyed the camp with air raids, as well as the railway bridges and railway lines from Hungary to Auschwitz. The murder of about 400,000 Hungarian Holocaust victims could have been prevented.\" </p> <p>The case is built around a January 22 1944 executive order signed by President Franklin Roosevelt calling on the government to take all measures to rescue the European Jews. The lawyers claim the order was ignored because of pressure brought by a group of big American companies, including BBH, where Prescott Bush was a director. </p> <p>Lissmann said: \"If we have a positive ruling from the court it will cause [president] Bush huge problems and make him personally liable to pay compensation.\" </p> <p>The US government and the Bush family deny all the claims against them. </p> <p>In addition to Eva Schweitzer's book, two other books are about to be published that raise the subject of Prescott Bush's business history. The author of the second book, to be published next year, John Loftus, is a former US attorney who prosecuted Nazi war criminals in the 70s. Now living in St Petersburg, Florida and earning his living as a security commentator for Fox News and ABC radio, Loftus is working on a novel which uses some of the material he has uncovered on Bush. Loftus stressed that what Prescott Bush was involved in was just what many other American and British businessmen were doing at the time. </p> <p>\"You can't blame Bush for what his grandfather did any more than you can blame Jack Kennedy for what his father did - bought Nazi stocks - but what is important is the cover-up, how it could have gone on so successfully for half a century, and does that have implications for us today?\" he said. </p> <p>\"This was the mechanism by which Hitler was funded to come to power, this was the mechanism by which the Third Reich's defence industry was re-armed, this was the mechanism by which Nazi profits were repatriated back to the American owners, this was the mechanism by which investigations into the financial laundering of the Third Reich were blunted,\" said Loftus, who is vice-chairman of the Holocaust Museum in St Petersburg. </p> <p>\"The Union Banking Corporation was a holding company for the Nazis, for Fritz Thyssen,\" said Loftus. \"At various times, the Bush family has tried to spin it, saying they were owned by a Dutch bank and it wasn't until the Nazis took over Holland that they realised that now the Nazis controlled the apparent company and that is why the Bush supporters claim when the war was over they got their money back. Both the American treasury investigations and the intelligence investigations in Europe completely bely that, it's absolute horseshit. They always knew who the ultimate beneficiaries were.\" </p> <p>\"There is no one left alive who could be prosecuted but they did get away with it,\" said Loftus. \"As a former federal prosecutor, I would make a case for Prescott Bush, his father-in-law (George Walker) and Averill Harriman [to be prosecuted] for giving aid and comfort to the enemy. They remained on the boards of these companies knowing that they were of financial benefit to the nation of Germany.\" </p> <p>Loftus said Prescott Bush must have been aware of what was happening in Germany at the time. \"My take on him was that he was a not terribly successful in-law who did what Herbert Walker told him to. Walker and Harriman were the two evil geniuses, they didn't care about the Nazis any more than they cared about their investments with the Bolsheviks.\" </p> <p>What is also at issue is how much money Bush made from his involvement. His supporters suggest that he had one token share. Loftus disputes this, citing sources in \"the banking and intelligence communities\" and suggesting that the Bush family, through George Herbert Walker and Prescott, got $1.5m out of the involvement. There is, however, no paper trail to this sum. </p> <p>The third person going into print on the subject is John Buchanan, 54, a Miami-based magazine journalist who started examining the files while working on a screenplay. Last year, Buchanan published his findings in the venerable but small-circulation New Hampshire Gazette under the headline \"Documents in National Archives Prove George Bush's Grandfather Traded With the Nazis - Even After Pearl Harbor\". He expands on this in his book to be published next month - Fixing America: Breaking the Stranglehold of Corporate Rule, Big Media and the Religious Right. </p> <p>In the article, Buchanan, who has worked mainly in the trade and music press with a spell as a muckraking reporter in Miami, claimed that \"the essential facts have appeared on the internet and in relatively obscure books but were dismissed by the media and Bush family as undocumented diatribes\". </p> <p>Buchanan suffers from hypermania, a form of manic depression, and when he found himself rebuffed in his initial efforts to interest the media, he responded with a series of threats against the journalists and media outlets that had spurned him. The threats, contained in e-mails, suggested that he would expose the journalists as \"traitors to the truth\". </p> <p>Unsurprisingly, he soon had difficulty getting his calls returned. Most seriously, he faced aggravated stalking charges in Miami, in connection with a man with whom he had fallen out over the best way to publicise his findings. The charges were dropped last month. </p> <p><b> Biography</b><br> </p> <p> Buchanan said he regretted his behaviour had damaged his credibility but his main aim was to secure publicity for the story. Both Loftus and Schweitzer say Buchanan has come up with previously undisclosed documentation. </p> <p>The Bush family have largely responded with no comment to any reference to Prescott Bush. Brown Brothers Harriman also declined to comment. </p> <p>The Bush family recently approved a flattering biography of Prescott Bush entitled Duty, Honour, Country by Mickey Herskowitz. The publishers, Rutledge Hill Press, promised the book would \"deal honestly with Prescott Bush's alleged business relationships with Nazi industrialists and other accusations\". </p> <p>In fact, the allegations are dealt with in less than two pages. The book refers to the Herald-Tribune story by saying that \"a person of less established ethics would have panicked ... Bush and his partners at Brown Brothers Harriman informed the government regulators that the account, opened in the late 1930s, was 'an unpaid courtesy for a client' ... Prescott Bush acted quickly and openly on behalf of the firm, served well by a reputation that had never been compromised. He made available all records and all documents. Viewed six decades later in the era of serial corporate scandals and shattered careers, he received what can be viewed as the ultimate clean bill.\" </p> <p>The Prescott Bush story has been condemned by both conservatives and some liberals as having nothing to do with the current president. It has also been suggested that Prescott Bush had little to do with Averill Harriman and that the two men opposed each other politically. </p> <p>However, documents from the Harriman papers include a flattering wartime profile of Harriman in the New York Journal American and next to it in the files is a letter to the financial editor of that paper from Prescott Bush congratulating the paper for running the profile. He added that Harriman's \"performance and his whole attitude has been a source of inspiration and pride to his partners and his friends\". </p> <p>The Anti-Defamation League in the US is supportive of Prescott Bush and the Bush family. In a statement last year they said that \"rumours about the alleged Nazi 'ties' of the late Prescott Bush ... have circulated widely through the internet in recent years. These charges are untenable and politically motivated ... Prescott Bush was neither a Nazi nor a Nazi sympathiser.\" </p> <p>However, one of the country's oldest Jewish publications, the Jewish Advocate, has aired the controversy in detail. </p> <p>More than 60 years after Prescott Bush came briefly under scrutiny at the time of a faraway war, his grandson is facing a different kind of scrutiny but one underpinned by the same perception that, for some people, war can be a profitable business.</p>",
  "Senior officials in the Bush administration clashed yesterday over Iraq's transition to democracy after the defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, suggested that the elections in January might be limited because of the chaos in parts of the country. <p>Richard Armitage, the deputy secretary of state contradicted the suggestion, insisting that the landmark vote had to take place in all regions, including those racked by insurgency. </p> <p>\"I know of no changes and no plans,\" Mr Armitage said yesterday. \"I think we're going to have an election that is free and open, and that has to be open to all citizens,\" he told a congressional committee. </p> <p>\"We've got to do our best efforts to get in troubled areas. ... I think we're going to have these elections in all parts of the country.\" </p> <p>Mr Rumsfeld agreed yesterday that every Iraqi \"deserves the right to vote\". But he added that the situation was \"uneven\" and that \"some locations are going to present somewhat greater challenges than others\". Earlier he had said that an election in three-quarters of the country would be better than no vote at all. </p> <p>The defence secretary added yesterday that US troops could start leaving Iraq before the country was peaceful again, and he compared the situation in the war-torn areas of the country to US inner cities. </p> <p>\"We had something like 200 or 300 or 400 people killed in many of the major cities of America last year. </p> <p>\"Is it perfectly peaceful? No. What's the difference? We just didn't see each homicide in every major city in the United States on television every night,\" Mr Rumsfeld said. </p> <p>The Democratic presidential challenger, John Kerry, seized on the different signals coming from the administration, as he switched the focus of his campaign on Iraq. </p> <p>\"If there was any doubt that the leaders of the Bush Administration are living in a fantasy world of spin, I think Secretary Rumsfeld put that doubt to rest,\" Mr Kerry said. \"We need to end this confusion. We need national leaders who will face reality - not only in Iraq but in the war on terror.\" </p> <p>The strategy of challenging his opponent's strongest suit - national security - is a gamble. Polls suggest that a significant majority of Americans trust the president more on Iraq and the \"war on terror\". Mr Kerry is behind in all the latest national polls, but appears to have closed the gap with Mr Bush to within five points over the past week. </p> <p>Repeating his assertion that the war in Iraq was a dangerous diversion from the US \"war on terror\", Mr Kerry said: \"An estimated 18,000 al-Qaida-trained militants are operating in 60 countries around the world in a dangerous and more elusive network of extremist groups.\" </p> <p>The remark was a direct response to the president's claims that three-quarters of al-Qaida's leadership had been captured or killed. </p> <p>Mr Kerry argued the most likely source terrorists would look to for weapons of mass destruction was the former Soviet Union, and that the administration was doing little to secure them. </p> <p>\"More such materials were secured in the two years before 9/11 than in the two years after,\" he said. \"I will secure all nuclear weapons and materials in the former Soviet Union within four years. At President Bush's pace, it will take 13 years.\" </p> <p>Jeff Shesol, a political historian and a former speechwriter for Bill Clinton, said Mr Kerry had little choice but to mount an attack on the president's strongest issue, in defiance of advice from some senior Democrats to stick to domestic issues. </p> <p>\"He's got to do it if he's going to win,\" Mr Shesol said. \"There's always a temptation for Democrats to say, 'Let's run on our issues and let them run on their issues.' But when 'their issues' are on the top of people's list of concerns, we would be unwise to give them a by.\" </p> <p>The Republican response to the attacks on the administration's foreign policy has been to suggest that a vote for Mr Kerry would help to undermine US troops in Iraq and weaken the fight against al-Qaida. </p> <p>Such sentiments have triggered outrage among Democrats, who say they go beyond the normal bounds of campaign debate. The Kerry campaign called the remarks un-American and undemocratic. </p> <p>Michael Wissot, a pollster for Luntz Research, which mainly advises Republican candidates, said the rhetoric ran the risk of backfiring, \"because people understand that this is much more than a question of an individual, and much more a question of collective policy decisions\". </p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> Three more members of an elite navy Seal unit have been charged with abusing Iraqi prisoners, one of whom died in custody after he had been beaten.</p>",
  "<p><strong> Moonstruck</strong> </p> <p> No cloud except prejudice could conceal the artistic chasm between the passage from Lee Harwood's \"Moon Suite\" and the passage from Philip Larkin's \"Sad Steps\" which Mark Ford is so rash as to print next to it, using the Harwood as a stick with which to beat Larkin (\"Emerging glorious from the clouds\", September 18). (Larkin is caught \"sneering\", while Harwood is \"wholly unembarrassed\" by his emotions). </p> <p>Since when has it been a poetic virtue not to be embarrassed? A bit of embarrassment might have revealed to Harwood that his grammar is wonky, his rhythms hopelessly flaccid and his diction banal: \"mean creatures\", \"moments of stillness\", \"emerge glorious from the clouds,/ radiant anew\". Harwood can do much better than this. </p> <p>Forget Larkin's politics, Mark Ford, and read the poem! Each phrase you've quoted is intense and surprising, despite the deliberate use of hyperbole that it pleases you to call sneering: \"lozenge of love\" (when was the moon called a lozenge before; since when was a lozenge an attribute of love?) \"immensements\" (what a sense of vastness the coined word summons), etc. </p> <p>Larkin's lines possess extraordinary linguistic, rhythmic and emotional complexity.

In fact the most recent common male ancestor must have been either the father, partner or son of the most recent common female ancestor. Dawkins's claim could only apply to the mitochondrial and Y-chromosome ancestors. </p> <p>Far more serious, though, is the distortion of logic used by all neo-Darwinists in their decision that genes must be the sole determinants of inheritable characteristics merely because they cannot detect anything else.<br><strong> Hugh Dower</strong><br>York </p> <p><strong> Controlled spirals</strong><br> </p> <p> William Wilbur's Saturday poem (\"In Trackless Woods\", September 18) concludes \"Or spirals in a pine-cone, under trees/ Not subject to our stiff geometries\". The spirals are in fact ruled by Fibonacci numbers, as are many other patterns in nature (another classic example of Fibonacci numbers is given by the whorls of seeds in sunflower heads).

  "<p>Midnight in Dublin on the north side of the river Liffey. Busty Lycra, a drag queen at the Guru club, and her friend Miss Misdemeanour huddle together for warmth as they shift from foot to foot and inhale deeply on their cigarettes. Their elaborate wigs and the white tassels of Miss Misdemeanour's red cowboy jacket flap in the chill wind.</p> <p>Later on stage, Busty asks clubbers for their opinion. \"What do you think of the smoking ban?\" As she turns her microphone in the direction of the audience, there is a loud roar - broadly of approval, but tinged with the occasional boo. \"What do you think? Yes? No? Fuck off?\". She laughs. </p> <p>As the evening wears on, more people head outside for cigarette breaks. They are laughing and joking as they collectively light up and attempt to shield themselves from the cool September air.</p> <p>\"I think it is a lot better, I like the clean air,\" says Laura Eustace, 35, as she takes a drag of her cigarette. \"I must admit when I first heard about it, I was absolutely horrified. But I have never spoken to so many people as I now have outside bars - it has a very sociable aspect to it.\"</p> <p>She says it is nice to go home \"and find that your hair and clothes don't stink of smoke the following day\". </p> <p>Six months after smoking was banned in workplaces (which includes bars and restaurants) Laura reckons there are still places \"out in the country\" where it is being defied. \"There are places in Kerry where people are smoking in pubs,\" she says. \"They just whip out the ashtrays when you get a lock-in. It is not as strict as Dublin. I have not found anywhere round here where you can have a cigarette.\"</p> <p>The Dubliners aired their views of the ban as a group of politicians and health officials from Greater Manchester visited this week on a fact-finding mission; they are hoping to make workplaces in the conurbation - population almost 3 million-smoke-free. If they are successful it will be the first place in England to enforce such a ban. On Thursday the health secretary, John Reid, indicated that the government would take action to tackle smoking in public places as he met campaigners from anti- and pro-smoking groups. He is expected to publish his long-awaited public health white paper next month. </p> <p>\"I have listened to all sides of this debate very carefully,\" he said. \"The balance of both evidence and opinion on this issue is such that the status quo cannot continue.\"</p> <p>In Dublin, the absence of smoke in pubs is startling. Instead of a thick, fuggy swirl hanging in the air, it smells different - the aroma of hearty nursery food and stale beer instead of tobacco. The brightly painted pubs and restaurants around Temple Bar are still busy with people drinking pints of Guinness. </p> <p>\"I have felt much healthier since the ban,\" says a woman who has worked behind a bar for four years. \"I used to get a lot of colds and problems with breathing after I had been at work. Now I don't have to wash my clothes and hair when I get home just to get rid of the smell of smoke.\" </p> <p>The Greater Manchester delegation met the Irish health minister, Miche\u00e1l Martin. He said around 7,000 people had given up smoking since the ban on March 29 - and the government would see the bene fits in reduced healthcare costs. The majority of hospital admissions, he said, were due to smoking-related illnesses. </p> <p>\"The world has not collapsed since the smoking ban,\" he said. \"Irish people continue to drink and go out. People now enjoy eating and drinking in a smoke-free atmosphere. When we visited New York, to find out about the smoking ban for ourselves, I asked if they had any regrets. They said the only regret was they wished they had done it sooner.\" </p> <p>He acknowledged there had been a reduction in tax revenue from tobacco, as fewer people are smoking, but said it would not make a significant difference as they would spend their money on other commodities. </p> <p>This month the drinks company Diageo said the ban had affected sales of Guinness in Ireland - which had fallen by 6%. Its chief executive, Paul Walsh, blamed lifestyle and demographic changes, price competition \"and the initial impact of the smoking ban\". </p> <p>Gallaher, the maker of Benson &amp; Hedges and Mayfair cigarettes, noted that cigarette sales in Ireland in the first five months of the year had fallen by 9%. </p> <p><strong>Sales fall </strong><br> </p> <p>What has been surprising has been how Ireland has wholeheartedly embraced the ban - the Office for Tobacco Control, which enforces it, reports there has been 96% compliance. </p> <p>There has, however, been a minor rebellion. The owners of Fibber Magees in Galway flouted the ban until they were threatened with legal action. Their protest was dismissed as something of a publicity stunt, rather than a serious uprising. </p> <p>Councillor Pat Karney, the head of Smoke Free Greater Manchester, described the delegation's visit as the most important 24 hours in the history of the campaign. </p> <p>\"In Greater Manchester, all workplaces will be going smoke-free as soon as possible,\" he vowed. \"Do not say it can't be done.\" </p> <p>He said the campaign was not about going after smokers, but about creating a healthy, smoke-free environment in the workplace. </p> <p>\"In Greater Manchester we are ahead of nearly every other region in the country - such as Birmingham and Newcastle - and we will move really quickly once the route map is outlined by health secretary John Reid.\" </p> <p>Another delegate, Lord Smith, the leader of the Association of Greater Manchester Authorities, said there was no reason Greater Manchester should be any different to Ireland, where the ban has been self-policing. \"Landlords don't want to break the law and nor do members of the public,\" he said. </p> <p>In Ireland, any contravention of the ban can result in a fine of \u20ac3,000 (\u00a32,000.) </p> <p>Danny Byrne, the owner of the Eliza Blues restaurant overlooking the Liffey, is broadly supportive of the ban. But he says if he were a bar owner he would have preferred segregated smoking areas and improved ventilation. \"It was too much to go for a total ban,\" he says. </p> <p>Not everyone is enamoured of the ban. In the Bagel Bar, smokers Julie O'Connor and Carol Conway say they never go to pubs any more. \"We don't mind a ban in a little coffee shop like this,\" Julie says. \"But we don't really go to pubs any more after work. </p> <p>\"Instead, we will go around to friends' houses to have a drink and a smoke. I am surprised that people have taken the smoking ban so well.\" </p> <p>Carol adds: \"My family lives in Northern Ireland and I was back up there at the weekend. I was smoking in the pub more than ever - just because I knew I could. </p> <p>\"Now when you walk into pubs the smell is disgusting. All you can smell are the toilets, the dirt and the musty upholstery.\"</p>",
  "A couple of years ago I managed to smuggle a \"Stop the war on Iraq\" carrier-bag into the Labour party conference and surreptitiously placed it on an empty chair hoping a television camera might focus on it. Before I could say \"Basra\", a formidable party official shot over and sat on it until the crumpled object lost even its function as a bag. <p>This episode sums up the futility of earlier efforts from within the party to persuade Tony Blair that a war in Iraq would be disastrous, as well as costly and illegal. We were ignored then and, if the prime minister has his way, we may be ignored again next week at Labour's conference in Brighton. </p> <p>But it is just possible that Tony Blair won't get his own way. This year for the first time it will be possible to debate up to eight \"contemp- orary issues\", a doubling in the number from previous years. The trade unions are determined that there should be a debate on Iraq. Earlier this month the TUC voted to call for the speedy withdrawal of the coalition forces, the dismantling of their military bases and demanded that Iraqi people be left free to rebuild their own country. The unions now need to carry that message - vital to their own members - to the Labour party. </p> <p>The war is the biggest issue for the constituencies too, with more than 14 resolutions being accepted by the all-powerful \"conference arrangements committee\". We should know by tomorrow evening what shape the debate may take. </p> <p>Add to this pressure from below the whispered entreaties to Blair from some inside No 10 that he needs to demonstrate some contrition over the war, and it should be impossible to sweep the war and occupation under the carpet. And neither should Labour want to. </p> <p>The appalling destruction and loss of innocent life in Iraq has corroded public trust in both the government and the party itself. As attacks intensify on British troops in the south, and as the growing brutality of the war is brought home to people in the most graphic way imaginable by Ken Bigley's appeal for his life, to pretend that all is going to plan is deeply offensive. A change in policy is both morally right and politically necessary. Labour supporters need evidence that the anti-war voices within the party can make themselves heard. This is in Labour's interests. </p> <p>Several of Labour's big affiliated trade unions, such as the Transport and General Workers' Union and the Communication Workers' Union, are long-time opponents of the war. The CWU's general secretary, Billy Hayes, took centre stage at the 2m-strong anti-war march in Hyde Park; the powerful public sector union Unison not only supported that demonstration but believes the war was illegal. </p> <p>Some of the constituency resolutions tabled on Iraq are broadly supportive of government policy, but it is difficult to envisage the unions collectively siding with them. The most committed opponents of the war are marshalling around a straightforward \"British troops out now\" posi tion, while others are opting for resolutions calling for \"British troops to be withdrawn as soon as possible\". </p> <p>If Labour's anti-war campaigners can link up with the trade unions and offer a plan for disengagement, our monomaniacal prime minister may find himself boxed in even further. That surely is their task over the next few days, as delegates try and work out a composite resolution on Iraq that can win a majority of votes on the conference floor. </p> <p>Last month over 100,000 rounds of ammunition were fired by British soldiers in southern Iraq. More recently a British officer warned: \"We don't have all that much time left.\" Even some of New Labour's panjandrums who hope for a Bush win in November must surely recognise that it would be ludicrous to leave the discussion of troop withdrawal until a flight, like that from Aden nearly 40 years ago, becomes a \"strategic withdrawal\". </p> <p>Next week can help to provide a real and perhaps final opportunity to leave Iraq with dignity intact. There are credible exit strategies, and it is time we came to the aid of presidential hopeful, John Kerry, who has at last emerged as the anti-war candidate. </p> <p>On Tuesday, Tony Blair not only needs to apologise for misleading the country into war, he should promise phased troop withdrawals which allow the Iraqis to resolve their own security problems, as they did in Najaf. He should also acknowledge that successful elections are only likely to take place in Iraq after America and Britain have gone, to be replaced by a \"Muslim stabilisation force\". </p> <p>The alternative is unthinkable. A Bush win in November may lead to a bloody offensive in rebel-held areas, and Britain would be dragged in ever further.
