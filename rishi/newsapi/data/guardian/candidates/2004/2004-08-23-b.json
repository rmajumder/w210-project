  "On the morning of polling day in the 1983 general election, I had a conversation in the local Labour committee rooms in Hackney. What do you think the result is going to be tonight, the ward secretary asked. I think the Tories will win by more than 100 seats, I replied. The ward secretary seemed taken aback. That wasn't the mood on the doorstep, he countered. In his view Labour would win by about 20. <p>Well, when the polls closed, it soon became clear that I was right and that the Labour ward secretary was wrong. Mrs Thatcher came back with a majority of 144, Labour slumped to 28% nationwide and just escaped falling into third place. </p> <p>Fast forward 14 years to the 1997 election. Another election-day conversation with another Labour official, only this time with the leader of the party. The subject was the same as before, only this time it was my turn to ask the question. What do you think the result will be? We might win by 50, he replied. More like 150, I retorted. </p> <p>The purpose of retelling these anecdotes is not to boast. The truth is that my powers of prediction are no better than anyone else's. My secret on both occasions was a simple one. Unlike the people I was talking to, I consistently believed the opinion polls. The polls said Thatcher would win by a landslide in 1983, and they said the same about Blair in 1997. I merely repeated what the polls were saying. </p> <p>I believed the polls then, and I believe the polls now. That is why, for example, when people ask me what I think will happen in the US presidential election, my answer is that John Kerry is winning. I say this, my abusive rightwing American email correspondents may like to note, not because I am a jerk or a pinko or because I come from a country that has lost its manhood, nor even because I want it to happen, but simply because that is currently the conclusion of most of the polls, especially in the battleground states. </p> <p>Which is not, I stress, the same thing as saying that Kerry will win. Maybe he will and maybe he won't. No opinion poll is foolproof. All of them have margins of error. And none of them is ever a prediction. They are merely a necessarily approximate snapshot of the state of opinion at a point in time. And since the US election is not until November 2, and the nuances and momentum of the polls change all the time, no prediction made in August can be anything but a more or less informed guess. All you can say, right now, is that it is a close election and that Kerry is narrowly in the lead. Calling me a jerk doesn't change that, you bigots. </p> <p>I accept, though, that those of us who believe the polls currently have some explaining to do on the domestic political front. This is particularly true in the combined wake of last week's Guardian-ICM poll, which found Iraq at the bottom of a list of prospective election issues, and Friday's Financial Times-Mori poll, which concluded that defence and foreign affairs were the most important issues facing the country. </p> <p>Shurely shome mishtake, even good observers have said on seeing these results, among them Peter Preston, who confessed to \"plain confusion\" on these pages 24 hours ago. But I think the confusion is more apparent than real, and I also think it is important to be able to show that this is so, not solely for reasons of amour-propre , but also even for reasons of the civic good. It would be good for our collective politics if we could stamp out the lazy conceits that the polls can't be trusted and that they can be made to support anything you want them to say.</p> <p>There are many variables between different polls - date, size of sample, method of contact, weighting and the rest. More than anything else, though, the results of different opinion polls depend on the questions that the pollsters ask. Confusion in; confusion out. Clarity in; clarity out. That is why the key to unravelling the ICM/Mori \"confusion\" is to be clear that they asked very different - not contradictory, just different - questions.</p> <p>In its poll for the Guardian, for example, ICM asked its sample: \"Now, thinking about the next election and the issues that will be important in your own decision on how to vote, which two or three of the following will be most important in your own decision on which party you will vote for?\" Respondents were offered 10 subjects, of which \"Iraq\" - that one word alone, note, not some other formulation like \"the Iraq war\" or \"Tony Blair's imperialist lies about Iraq\" or any of the almost infinite number of possible permutations - was one. Just 12% of all voters selected \"Iraq\", which came bottom of the pile topped by the NHS on 59%. </p> <p> Meanwhile, going into the field that same weekend for the FT, Mori was asking its sample: \"What would you say is the most important issue facing Britain today?\", before asking them to add \"other important issues facing Britain today\". Mori's sample were not prompted with a list of issues - unlike the ICM sample - and their unprompted replies were then allocated by the pollsters into Mori's regular categories. In this latest FT poll, \"defence/foreign affairs/international terrorism\" came top for \"most important\" single issue (24%) and retained that place when \"other important issues\" were added in (38%).</p> <p>Does this mean that the polls are saying contradictory things? It is possible - rogue polls can happen - but very unlikely. It certainly is not happening in this instance. The key thing to notice is that the two polling organisations were simply asking different questions: ICM about the issues that would influence the way you voted at the election, but Mori about the most important issue facing the country.</p> <p>These two polls, far from being contradictory, are in fact compatible. It is perfectly possible to see a subject as the most important facing the country while simultaneously not giving it great importance in your decision on which way to vote. In the 80s, polls regularly showed that unemployment was deemed the most important issue facing the country, and even that Labour had the best policies for dealing with it. But that didn't mean that people voted Labour. They voted Conservative because, when it came to voting, issues like taxes and economic competence - on which the Tories had the advantage - mattered more.</p> <p>A similar dynamic is at work today. Foreign affairs, defence and international terrorism may indeed be the most important issue facing the nation - a pretty capacious bag that category is, by the way, containing many other issues besides Iraq. A party which could find something compelling to say about that bunch of issues would certainly have an advantage - as the Lib Dems have discovered. Even so, when it comes to the election, as ICM found, it's the same old story. Next year, most people will cast their votes because of the things that make a difference to themselves and their families - health, education and the rest of it. Which is why Labour will win. Just as the polls say they will.</p> <p><b>\u00b7</b> <a href=\"mailto:martin.kettle@theguardian.com\">martin.kettle@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "Vladimir Putin made a rare visit to Chechnya yesterday to support its pro-Moscow administration by laying a wreath at the grave of Akhmad Kadyrov, the Chechen president assassinated in May. <p>The visit, Mr Putin's second since the killing and the third of his presidency, was an attempt to bolster his claim that Russian-backed martial law has brought peace. </p> <p>It came ahead of an election to choose Mr Kadyrov's successor. Alu Alkhanov, the Chechen interior minister, and the Kremlin's choice, is expected to win. </p> <p>Mr Putin's visit was undermined by reports of persistent fighting between federal troops and separatists. </p> <p>Hours before Mr Putin landed at Kadyrov's home town of Tsentoroi to lay the red carnations, officials had reported clashes between militants and federal troops. </p> <p>One government official told the Associated Press news agency that more than 30 people had died, including 23 troops, when three polling stations were at tacked. Other officials said the figures were lower. </p> <p>Under intense security, Mr Putin was pictured on Russian television alongside Kadyrov's son and former chief of security, Ramzan Kadyrov, and Mr Alkhanov, marking what would have been Kadyrov's 53rd birthday. </p> <p>\"We lost a very courageous, talented and exceptionally decent person,\" state TV showed the president saying. </p> <p>Since Kadyrov's death, the Kremlin has almost beatified him, although he had been accused of brutality and corruption. </p> <p>Ramzan Kadyrov has sought a wider role since his father's death, even offering this weekend to send troops to help stem a conflict in neighbouring South Ossetia. Yet he is seen to lack his father's commanding presence in the republic.</p>",
  "An audit by international observers supported official election results that gave President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez of Venezuela victory in a referendum to recall him, the secretary general of the Organisation of American States said. <p>Although observers such as the former US president Jimmy Carter and the OAS secretary general, C\u00e9sar Gaviria, endorsed the election council's results for the August 15 vote, they proposed the audit to assuage the opposition's concerns of vote fraud. </p> <p>However, the opposition refused to participate in the audit, saying they did not believe the methodology was capable of detecting fraud. </p> <p>Mr Gaviria said: \"In our opinion, the type of check used in this audit of the electronic system doesn't leave us much doubt regarding the result. </p> <p>\"It's evident that the opposition has huge doubts regarding the results. We cannot say categorically there was not fraud; we are saying we didn't find it.\" </p> <p>Mr Ch\u00e1vez trounced his enemies by capturing 59% of the vote. </p> <p>Venezuelan election authorities and international observers from the OAS and Atlanta-based Carter Centre, began inspecting ballots from 150 voting stations last Thursday.</p>",
  "John Kerry is on track to win the upcoming US presidential election in November, if giant Madagascar hissing roaches are to be trusted.

  "<p>A Norwich-based politics student is planning to challenge the education secretary, Charles Clarke, for his seat in the next general election.</p> <p>Adrian Ramsey, 23, who is studying for a masters in politics at the University of East Anglia (UEA), believes he can gain votes from students and families who are disillusioned with the government over top-up fees. </p> <p>The student will stand as a Green party candidate in Norwich South, Mr Clarke's constituency. He is already a councillor on Norwich city council.</p> <p>Mr Ramsey, whose candidacy was announced today, said: \"Clarke's often described as a political heavyweight. But I'm confident that the issues I believe in are important. The Green party is on the up in Norwich and people want a change.\"</p> <p>The party holds five council seats within Mr Clarke's constituency. Mr Ramsey was first elected to the council in 2001 when he was 21, making him the youngest councillor to be elected in the city. This year he was re-elected with 49% of the vote. </p> <p>Mr Ramsey said he planned to fight the election on the issues of top-up fees and Iraq. \"The public's opposition to top-up fees is symptomatic of wider disillusionment with new Labour policies.\" </p> <p>He said he would use his experience of activating the student vote in the local elections to help him win the general election, which is expected some time next year. There are 13,000 students at UEA, many of whom live in Norwich.</p>",
  "The Conservatives today mooted repealing the Human Rights Act as part of its manifesto for the next general election. <p>The shadow home secretary, David Davis, announced he is to form a commission to look at \"reform, replacement or repeal\" of the legislation - which was seen as one of Labour's landmark achievements on coming to office.</p> <p>The Tory commission - its members have yet to be announced - will report back in time for the general election, with Mr Davis pledging to make its conclusions a \"high priority\" for an incoming Conservative government.</p> <p>Any move to amend, or even end, the rights conferred under the act, which was brought in four years ago to implement the European convention on human rights (ECHR), is certain to prove controversial.</p> <p>But Mr Davis insisted there were now \"too many spurious rights\" as a result of the \"unintended consequences\" of the act.</p> <p>Conservative-produced statistics claim that there has been a 20-fold increase in cases in which the convention has now been considered - and a 70% increase in cases in which it has affected the outcome.</p> <p>In a Westminster press conference, Mr Davis said that the act - which was passed in 1998 and came into force in 2000 - has allowed convicted killers access to hardcore pornography in prison, and given travellers the right to set up homes in country villages.</p> <p>He also said that the number of prisoners in Scotland serving a life sentence who were awarded parole had leapt by 40% as a result of the act.</p> <p>\"Some, if not all, of these consequences would be disapproved of by most UK citizens,\" he said.</p> <p>The shadow home secretary said he was in favour of \"real human rights\", and had opposed David Blunkett's attempts in parliament to curb trial by jury.</p> <p>A chair of the new commission has already been appointed, Mr Davis revealed, although he refused to say who it was or who its members would be until October - probably in time for the Tory party conference in Bournemouth.</p> <p>Mr Davis first spelled out plans for reform of the Human Rights Act in an article for the Spectator last week. </p> <p>Mr Davis said he wanted to cut back the \"cancer of litigation\" caused by the act. \"Once we had inherited English liberties; now we have incorporated European rights,\" he wrote. </p> <p>\"The English idea - evolved through the Magna Carta (1215), the Petition of Right (1628) and the Bill of Rights (1689) - was of freedom held back from the state. </p> <p>\"The idea - invented by the Code Napoleon - is of bounties handed out by the state. </p> <p>\"Once, the law limited the state and enlarged the sphere in which the citizen could be free; now, it imposes obligations on the state and limits the freedom of the citizen.\" </p> <p>In effect, by incorporating the ECHR into British law, the Tories argue that the Labour government streamlined the procedure by which applicants had to go to Europe to have their cases adjudicated upon. </p> <p>Mr Davis admitted it would be \"highly complex\" to redraw the law, but said that the Tories were not considering withdrawing from the ECHR itself.</p> <p>Human rights lawyer Geoffrey Bindman QC rejected the idea that the Human Rights Act, which enshrined the European convention into British law, was based on continental legal principles. </p> <p> \"That convention very much expresses principles of English law going back centuries, and the drafting of the convention was largely done by British lawyers led by a former Conservative lord chancellor,\" he told the BBC's World At One programme. \"It is simply not true that we have incorporated some European document.\" </p> <p>He added that only a very small number of cases had been brought to court under the act. \"In fact, because of the reduction in the availability of legal aid by the present government, it is extremely difficult for anybody to mount a human rights claim,\" he said.</p> <p>The Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, Mark Oaten, said: \"The increase in spurious compensation claims is bad news, but the Human Rights Act is not the cause. The act contains principles which most of us agree are a good thing, like the right to life, to a fair trial, and to freedom of speech. </p> <p>Meanwhile the president of the Law Society, Edward Nally, said: \"A recent government study found the compensation culture is an urban myth fuelled by misleading media coverage. </p> <p>\"It is only right that genuine claimants whose lives have been ruined in that way should receive compensation. It would be nonsensical to exclude the public services from that.\"</p>",
  "<p>A Yorkshire council's decision to pull out of the region's unelected regional assembly could be the first in a series of resignations, it has emerged.</p> <p>East Riding council has withdrawn from the Yorkshire and Humber assembly, claiming that the voluntary membership body was a waste of money.</p> <p>The council's leader, Stephen Parnaby, said other local authorities are now understood to be giving the matter \"serious consideration\", in light of his council's decision.</p> <p>The country is divided into eight assemblies which draw together a wide range of regional stakeholders to consider and respond to the needs of each region.</p> <p>The forums play a role in scrutinising the regional development agencies, and are the regional planning bodies responsible for drawing up spatial strategies.</p> <p>Council representatives comprise a significant part of the assembly makeup, and pay a subscription formulated on population size.</p> <p>East Riding's Tories wanted to withdraw the council's \u00a387,500 subscription as part of efficiency savings in this year's budget.

  "<p>On a steamy Saturday afternoon last weekend, 120 or so people filed into the Quad Cinema in New York's West Village to do something they had probably never done before: watch Fox News. </p> <p>Or rather, they were watching a documentary about Fox News: an angry evisceration of America's rabidly rightwing 24-hour news channel. The gasps from the liberal audience were frequently audible. Outfoxed: Rupert Murdoch's War on Journalism is a polemic in the same vein as Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 9/11. The film rounds on Fox for hiding behind objectivity; although the channel's twin mottos are \"We report, you decide\" and \"Fair and balanced\" it hammers home the point that Fox is neither. Clips show anchors ridiculing Democratic presidential nominee John Kerry for looking French (an incalculable insult in the mind of a conservative), counting down the days \"until president Bush is re-elected\" and brutalising liberal guests. Another anchor chirps that \"North Korea loves John Kerry\". </p> <p>\"We weren't necessarily, as it was told to us, a newsgathering organisation, so much as we were a proponent of a point of view,\" says John Du Pre, a former Fox correspondent, in the film. </p> <p>In one sequence that seems like a bad joke, the veteran anchor Brit Hume stands in front of two maps side by side, one of Iraq, one of California. As he updates on the American dead in the Iraqi conflict, he deadpans that there is more chance of being shot in Burbank than Baghdad. The implication seemed to be that we should stop our liberal handwringing. </p> <p>The film, the work of Hollywood producer/director Robert Greenwald, was made on a shoestring budget of $300,000, largely funded by campaigning leftwing organisations, and began life as a so-called \"guerrilla\" DVD sold online. One of the organisations, <a href=\"http://www.Moveon.org\">Moveon.org</a>, screened the film at around 3,500 \"house parties\" across the nation. It quickly topped Amazon.com's bestsellers list. In the past few weeks the film has won theatrical release in a handful of American cities and it could now be picked up nationwide. </p> <p>Outfoxed is one of a new breed of documentaries enjoying unprecedented success in American cinemas. The most successful of the lot, Fahrenheit 9/11, Moore's biting but meandering assault on the Bush administration, has made more than $100m at the US box office alone. </p> <p>Others include Control Room, a portrait of the Arabic network al-Jazeera; The Corporation, an examination of corporate America; Super Size Me, a wry take on the ill effects of McCulture that opens soon in Britain, and Hunting the President, a trot through the hounding of former president Bill Clinton. </p> <p>The phenomenon could simply be a hunger for polemic in politically charged times. Outfoxed, while ridiculing the bias of Fox News, certainly makes no pretence at fair play itself, giving the channel no right of reply and indulging in some suspect editing to make its points. </p> <p>The success of the films, though, could also be explained by a different sentiment - a growing sense that Americans have been failed by the mainstream media, particularly since the Iraq war, and have an urge to seek out information elsewhere. It is probably no coincidence that in each case the underlying villain is the mainstream American media. Outfoxed is just the most stunning and unapologetic exemplar. </p> <p>It also seems unlikely to be a coincidence that the tub-thumping documentary is succeeding at a time when the nation's most well-respected newspapers and some of the best-known TV anchors are admitting that they failed to ask the tough questions in the run-up to war in Iraq. </p> <p>The mainstream media's self-doubt was most recently evident in the Washington Post, which on August 12 ran a critical self-examination of its coverage in the months leading into the war and beyond. Stories questioning the rationale for war were buried at the back of the paper, while government proclamations regularly found their place on the front page. The piece concluded that, with hindsight, coverage had \"looked strikingly one-sided at times\". </p> <p>In May, the New York Times delivered an even harsher assessment of its own performance. Some stories, the newspaper ombudsman Daniel Okrent said, \"pushed Pentagon assertions so aggressively you could almost sense epaulets on the shoulders of editors\". </p> <p>The Post article ended with a question: \"Whether a tougher approach by The Post and other news organisations would have slowed the rush to war is, at best, a matter of conjecture.\" The comment drew angry responses from readers. \"Clearly, this is untrue,\" wrote one. \"If we believe that a properly informed citizenry is integral to a functional democracy, we should either recognise the media's role in allowing the war to happen or accept that we don't have a functioning democracy.\" And Christiane Amanpour of CNN at the end of last year aired her belief that the press had been \"muzzled\" by the government. </p> <p>The sense that Americans have lost some trust in mainstream US media is borne out elsewhere. Americans dubious of the cheerleading at home have been scrambling for overseas news coverage ever since the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Almost 45% of the 9.6 million users accessing the Guardian's website originate in the US. </p> <p>Conspiracy theories have abounded not just about the administration but also about the media's complicity. Control Room touches on the well-rehearsed theory that the Pentagon press office staged the iconic toppling of the statue of Saddam Hussein in Baghdad. </p> <p>The thirst for \"truth\" also seems evident in the sheer volume of books clogging the bestsellers lists that promise to reveal the facts about the decisions that led to the Iraq war and the Bush administration. They have included the former intelligence chief Richard Clarke's Against All Enemies and Ron Suskind's The Price of Loyalty, based on the recollections of the former treasury chief Paul O'Neill. </p> <p>Of concern to journalists is that an unchecked mass of information, often with a clear agenda, is being embraced as fact. During the recent preview of autumn programming on ABC, the TV news anchor George Stephanopoulos expressed some concern at the growth of films like Fahrenheit 9/11 and the reasons for their popularity. </p> <p>He said he had seen the film with a group of undecided voters. \"What was most striking to me is when I asked them: 'Why did you go to see it?' and they said: 'Because we wanted to get the facts',\" he told reporters. \"At least a few of them had the sense that if it's coming from the government, if it's coming from the established media, they must not be telling us something, and we have to go to this alternative venue to get the facts.\" </p> <p>Even Hollywood directors are taking note. A recent article in the Los Angeles Times pointed to the re-emergence of politically charged films including The Manchurian Candidate, in which a vice presidential candidate is in the sway of a Halliburton-style corporation. \"The free press hasn't been on the job,\" the director Jonathan Demme told the paper. \"Maybe people are turning to all these films and documentaries for information, as if they're an unconscious effort to fill a void.\" </p> <p>The grasp for information could, though, simply be another example of the yawning chasm that divides America: the culture wars between the metropolitan values of the coasts and the conservative values of the vast swathes in between, a clash more in evidence now than ever before. </p> <p>Most of the bestselling books are anti-Bush and most of the documentaries now packing them in at the cinemas notably appeal to liberal sensibilities. Al Franken's recent book Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them attempts to explode the myth of liberal control of the media.

  "<p>We are likely to hear a lot about former United States president Herbert Hoover in the coming months as the US election approaches in November. </p> <p>But it is a name that president George Bush would rather forget. </p> <p>Hoover, a Republican, was president from 1929 to 1933 and his term saw the stock market crash of 1929 and the early years of the Great Depression. </p> <p>He was walloped by Franklin D Roosevelt in November 1932, having presided over huge job losses and having shanty towns on the edge of cities dubbed \"Hoovervilles\". </p> <p>The similarity to Bush, also a Republican, is that the present incumbent faces the prospect of becoming the first president since Hoover to preside over a net loss of jobs in a four-year term. </p> <p>As Bush's term has followed the eight years of economic boom under Bill Clinton, the Hoover comparison is one that hurts. </p> <p>It hands Democratic challenger John Kerry one of his strongest cards in the campaign. </p> <p>It has been touch and go all year as to whether jobs growth, measured by monthly non-farm payrolls data, would be sufficiently rapid to save Bush from having to adopt the Hoover mantle. </p> <p>But the low new jobs figure of 32,000 in July, compared with a Wall Street forecast of a 220,000 gain, combined with a downward revision of 50,000 to the jobs numbers of the previous two months, means Bush needs almost a quarter of a million new jobs a month between now and the end of the year to replace all the jobs lost since he took power in 2000. </p> <p>True, the economy has created 1.5m jobs in the past year, but that has barely kept pace with the country's population growth so has made little dent in the ranks of the unemployed and is the slowest employment recovery in several decades. </p> <p>Since the payrolls number emerged, radio programmes in the US have been dominated by phone-ins about the economy and jobs, to the delight of the Kerry camp and the chagrin of Bush, who prefer to talk tough about their wartime leader. </p> <p>Bush regularly argues that the economy has \"turned the corner\". Kerry retorts that the recovery has made a u-turn to nowhere. </p> <p>On the grounds that, to borrow a famous phrase from a Clinton campaign adviser in 1992, \"it's the economy, stupid\" that decides elections, Bush junior is only too aware that he could yet be defeated by a so-called \"jobless recovery\", as his father was 12 years ago. </p> <p>There is little dispute that the economy, which began to grow robustly earlier this year and create jobs at a decent pace, has stumbled over the past couple of months with consumer spending grinding to a halt and growth slowing to 3% annualised in the second quarter from 4.5% in the first. </p> <p>Economists blame the stumbling economy on the rising cost of energy, with oil prices up nearly a third this year, and the fading impact of last year's tax cuts. </p> <p>US Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan has assured Americans that this is a \"soft patch\" that will prove short-lived. </p> <p>He needs to hope so. Interest rates, at 1.5%, are only a touch above their lowest level for decades, leaving Greenspan almost no possibility of cutting rates sharply if the economy remains in the doldrums. </p> <p>Indeed, he says the Fed will continue gradually raising rates to more normal levels but that could be awkward if the economy is proving more sluggish than expected. </p> <p>Economists remain divided as to whether the slowdown is normal for this stage of a recovery and will be temporary or whether it represents the running out of steam of a house price and credit bubble which has been driven by cheap money and the tax cuts of the past three years. </p> <p>For Bush that is an argument that will play itself out in the fullness of time. He needs good news on the economy and he needs it fast. </p> <p>The trouble is, it is not easy to see where that is going to come from in the near future. Payroll data may show some recovery but is unlikely to bring down the unemployment rate of 5.5% by much and is also unlikely to chase the Hoover comparisons away. </p> <p>Although manufacturing appears to be prospering and cars sold well last month, stock markets have fallen to their lowest levels this year and oil prices have been marching relentlessly to a record high of nearly $49 barrel on Friday, leading to steep rises in gasoline prices at the pumps and making these testing times for Mr Bush, a former oil man. </p> <p>Last week's oil price rises will feed through to the forecourts in the coming weeks. </p> <p>With taxes on fuel much lower in the US than in Britain, rises in oil prices have a proportionately greater impact on gasoline prices in America than here, where tax makes up 85% of the price. </p> <p>Some estimates put the amount Americans are spending on gasoline at $10bn a month more than they were a year ago. </p> <p>That is money unavailable for other spending and Americans are feeling the pinch. </p> <p>Concern about the strength of the recovery is likely to keep share prices under pressure on Wall Street. </p> <p>The prices of gas and shares, along with jobs, are the sort of things Americans notice and care about and the flow of news has been almost universally negative. </p> <p>True, other measures of employment have been stronger than the payrolls numbers but it is the payrolls that grab the headlines. Mr Greenspan, after all, has told us that it is those numbers that matter. </p> <p>All of this makes Mr Bush sound almost the hapless victim of unfavourable economic circumstance but the idea that he is an innocent bystander, so to speak, is a long way from the truth. </p> <p>Apart from the fact that the fighting in Iraq is a key element in keeping oil prices high, there are two other, related factors for which Mr Bush is responsible and which, if he loses to Kerry, will go down as key reasons for the defeat. Those are his tax cuts and the explosion of the government deficit. </p> <p>Mr Bush's tax cuts have been staggering in their scope and audacity. A report this month showed that Bush's $270bn tax cut last year, which the Republicans said would boost growth and jobs, had overwhelmingly gone to the rich, as sceptics such as Harvard economist Paul Krugman have long argued. </p> <p>The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office said one-third of the tax cuts had gone to the richest 1% of Americans, who earn an average of $1.2m a year. </p> <p>The average tax cut for them totalled $78,500. </p> <p>By contrast, those in the middle income bracket got a tax cut of $1,000 and the poorest fifth were doled out the majestic sum of $250 for the whole year. Some tax cut. </p> <p>The problem for the economy is that rich people don't spend tax cuts as a rule. Poor people do, as any economist could have told Mr Bush, had he been inclined to listen, which is doubtful. </p> <p>As a result of the tax cuts, Mr Bush has managed to turn a budget surplus of about $100bn three years ago into a deficit of more than $400bn this year. </p> <p>That is some swing. Mr Bush likes to say the deficit is due to the increased cost of his war on terror. But a glance at the figures shows the tax cuts are to blame. </p> <p>Both candidates for the presidency have said they will tackle the deficit, although Mr Bush wants to make his tax cuts permanent, meaning a total giveaway of up to $2 trillion over the next decade. </p> <p>He would like to cut spending on things such as social security to close the gap. So the poor would end up paying for the tax cut to the rich. </p> <p>Mr Kerry would reduce the tax cuts for households earning over $200,000 a year, making the rich give back the money heaped on them by Mr Bush. </p> <p>His campaign says this would raise nearly $1 trillion over the next decade and finance a new healthcare system. </p> <p>So, given the state of the economy and the fact that only the rich have really benefited from the Bush tax cuts, the really puzzling thing about all of this is why Mr Bush is still neck-and-neck with Mr Kerry in the opinion polls. </p> <p>Maybe, after all, it isn't the economy, stupid. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:\" ashley.seager@theguardian.com\">ashley.seager@theguardian.com</a></p>",

  "President George Bush stood accused of appropriating the Olympic movement for political means last night, amid reports he was planning to visit Athens later this week to watch some sporting events, including a potential gold-medal winning bid by the Iraqi football team. <p>According to unconfirmed reports in the US, the White House is examining the logistical and security implications of Mr Bush travelling to the Greek capital in time for Saturday's football final. Iraq, whose progress to the semi-finals of the tournament has been one of the games' most captivating stories, will meet Paraguay tomorrow night for a possible place in the finals. </p> <p>The Greek foreign ministry confirmed last night that the US secretary of state, Colin Powell, will be in Athens for the closing ceremony. </p> <p>But it is the potential presidential visit to the games that will fuel a dispute between the election campaign of Mr Bush and his running mate, Dick Cheney, and the US Olympic Committee over an advert which links Iraq's and Afghanistan's participation in the games with the US administration's \"war on terror\". </p> <p>The advert, which has been broadcast in the US for the past week, begins with footage from the 1972 Olympic games in Munich, during which 13 Israeli athletes were killed by terrorists, and continues with a narrator saying: \"Freedom is spreading through the world like a sunrise. And this Olympics there will be two more free nations and two less terrorist regimes.\" </p> <p>As the flags of Afghanistan and Iraq flutter in the breeze, it concludes: \"With strength, resolve and courage, democracy will triumph over terror and hope will defeat hatred.\" </p> <p>Under American copyright law, only the US Olympic Com mittee has the right to use the Olympic insignia, images and trademarks for marketing purposes. </p> <p>Initially, the committee reportedly called for the advert to be withdrawn, but its spokesman retreated from that last night. </p> <p>\"We have contacted the president's election campaign team and asked them to forward us a copy of the advert. Once we have reviewed it and determined the type and extent of the use of the Olympic name, we will decide how to progress,\" a spokesman, Darryl Seibel, said. </p> <p>The committee might want to avoid a confrontation with Mr Bush, but it appears that the objects of his affections have no such qualms. </p> <p>To the embarrassment of their media handlers in Athens, members of the Iraqi football team have reacted furiously to the news that their efforts are being used to aid Mr Bush's efforts to win a second term in the White House. </p> <p>The team's coach, Adnan Hamd, told Sports Illustrated magazine: \"My problem is not with the American people. They are with what America has done; destroyed everything. The American army has killed so many people in Iraq. What is freedom when I go to the stadium and there are shootings on the road?\" </p> <p>One of the team's midfield players, Ahmad Manajid, accused Mr Bush of \"slaughtering\" Iraqi men and women. \"How will he meet his God having slaughtered so many? I want to defend my home. If a stranger invades America and the people resist, does that make them a terrorist?\" he said. </p> <p>Mark Clark, the spokesman for the Iraqi Olympic squad in Athens, accused journalists of taking advantage of the players. \"They are not very sophisticated politically. Whoever posed these questions knew the answers would be negative. It is possible something was lost in translation. The players are entitled to their opinions but we are disappointed,\" he said. </p> <p>Mr Bush, not hitherto known as a keen football fan, has made repeated references to the performances of the Iraqi football team in his campaign speeches. </p> <p>After its unexpected 4-2 victory over Portugal, he told a crowd in Oregon that the fact the team was in Athens was fantastic, adding: \"It wouldn't have been free if the United States hadn't acted.\"</p>",
  "Viewing figures for television news - from Shepherd's Bush to San Francisco - tell exactly the same story. Faraway places with strange-sounding names don't set punters' pulses racing any longer. Call it tuning out more than dumbing down. Moqtada al-Sadr, the Mahdi, Najaf? Let's see how Paula Radcliffe is doing (and leave our political masters to finish their August dozes). <p>The unholy streets round the holy mosque in the holy city shouldn't matter an electoral damn. Why, asked one American late-night comedian the other evening, can't we have our holy cities too? \"Why not holy Toledo, Ohio?\" Yet the poundings of the US jets and the defiance of the fighters in the alleys bring curious unease in high places. Iraq's new \"strongman\" prime minister looks suddenly feeble. Coalition disaster, as well as coalition triumph, begins to surface. How is that playing in Tottenham (and Toledo)?</p> <p>With some odd, even mysterious, dislocations. Last week an ICM poll for the Guardian showed health, education and all the usual stuff heading voter concerns - and Iraq sliding to the bottom of the Issues Premiership. Media and chattering classes out of touch as Blair breathes again sensation!</p> <p>But three days later, a Mori poll for the FT tried much the same exercise. Guess what? Schools and the NHS are supposedly relegation topics. The No1 problem for Labour, apparently, is Baghdad (with foreign affairs and defence pounding in behind). </p> <p>You can explain away some of these discrepancies, of course. Polls are taken at slightly different times, using slightly different formulations. There are inevitable margins of errors and borders of incomprehension. But there is also plain confusion. Where is the Iraqi issue, now for Bush and next year for Blair? Because if it is No 1, then trouble comes calling. </p> <p>The Downing Street hope rests on time and forgetfulness. So long after the war, do voters really remember and harbour resentment? The Labour party does, and, as we may see, in good conference measure. Many of those beyond Brighton who demonstrated so furiously also remain incensed. But do wider fires still burn? </p> <p>Most polling agrees on one one thing. Labour, even in the doggiest days of mid-summer, remains ahead. The Tories are stuck with no more than a third of voters, incapable of moving beyond that. Tony Blair isn't popular, but he is more popular than Michael Howard. Perhaps Iraq is a migraine, but the Tories have no miracle on offer, just pain all the same. Labour only gets it in the neck if Iraq puts itself at the centre of the electoral calculation, an inescapable issue. </p> <p>That may come to pass. Look at petrol prices going through the roof. Look at budget calculations getting dodgier. Look at a policy - never apologised for, yet never justified by events - that grows worse the more bad news piles in. Look at the commitment (in cash, effort and lives) without end. Yet it is difficult to see how Baghdad turns the screw that wrecks Labour. Whatever the electorate feels, whichever poll you believe, cause and effect remain only loosely connected.</p> <p>And perhaps that is the way they'll remain across the Atlantic. There, Iraq is a No 5 sort of issue, behind the economy, education, Medi care and terrorism: not out of sight, but out of the medals (where homeland terror flourishes like a winner's laurel wreath). TV, playing dumber than dumb, rates Olympic gold far ahead of Iraq's gloom. Most of the time, a news tickertape along the bottom of the screen handles faraway places. Even US military deaths are taken routinely, as long as they come in penny packages. </p> <p>The pending debate for the Republican convention is the size of the demos on New York's streets, not the substantive situation in Najaf's mosques. Ayad Allawi, apparently, is handling it. Our boys are the humble servants of Baghdad legitimacy and dawning democracy. A vital distance lends enchantment. </p> <p>But TV can render distance irrelevant in a trice, for the political trick - and media finagle - cuts both ways. Allawi, and others from his cabinet, are busy chaps curiously available for satellite interview at the drop of an invitation from any relevant show. Good Morning, America; good morning, Messrs Humphrys, Naughtie and Stourton. They aren't over there; they are, by design, over here (even as trophies for touting around Brighton). </p> <p>It may prove an untender media trap. Shuffling off the direct pain of Najaf and Abu Ghraib, for the White House, means creating the impression of a tougher, tighter Baghdad administration. But what happens when Allawi is stuck with doing imperative Iraqi things, like more negotiation with Moqtada al-Sadr and less zapping from the skies? Then the armchair TV analysts begin to turn against him. Then it's somehow his fault that \"our boys can't finish the job\". But without him, there's no job to finish. Without his government's survival, there will be no elections and thus no eventual exit. Is this no-win with or without? </p> <p>For George Bush, the size of the Shia insurgency is becoming a terrible test, a bet on Iraqi hearts, minds and resolve that tanks and jets cannot touch. There may be no alternative (and Kerry hasn't got one), but quagmires engulf the unwary. </p> <p>And Blair, if both Bush and Allawi totter? That would be miscalculation compounded, one damn thing going with another - and looking round for an inevitable sacrifice. That would be a foreign affair come home to roost. </p> <p>Those polls, you see, may not be as dissonant as they seem to be. This crisis cuts both ways - and Moqtada al-Sadr is a hairy man who may yet bring the smooth men much grief.</p> <p><a href=\"mailto:p.preston@theguardian.com\">p.preston@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "\"A true war story is never moral. It does not instruct, nor encourage virtue, nor suggest models of proper human behaviour, nor restrain men from doing the things men have always done. If at the end of a war story you feel that some small bit of rectitude has been salvaged from the larger waste, then you have been made the victim of a very old and terrible lie.\" <br> <b>\u00b7 </b>Tim O'Brien, The Things They Carried <p>Vietnam war veteran and Democratic presidential hopeful John Kerry has been ambushed and, for the moment, remains caught in enemy fire. Having made his five-month stint of decorated service in Vietnam the heart of his platform, it is now emerging as his achilles heel. </p> <p>A group of veterans financed by Republicans from Texas and close to President George Bush are airing ads calling him a liar for the claims he has made about his service and suggesting that he did not come by his military medals honestly. Their case is shoddy, given that none of the Swift-boat Veterans for Truth were with Kerry at the time and their claims have been refuted by those who were. Their motivation is shabby, as most of them are piqued by the fact that Kerry returned home to campaign against the war. All of which makes the fact that their attacks have had such a huge impact that much more revealing. </p> <p>For since the ads began screening, Kerry's slight lead in the polls has been shaved away. Two weeks ago, before the ads appeared, he was running even with Bush among the nation's 26 million veterans. Now Bush has a 24-point lead. The issue dominating the news cycle is not what is happening in Najaf today but what happened in the Mekong delta 35 years ago. </p> <p>There are three things we can learn from this. First, there is no level to which Republicans will not stoop to besmirch a character, belittle an issue or befuddle the electorate. Second, there is no level to which the Democrats will not stoop to attempt to neutralise these attacks. And third, that the Republicans will always win in this race to the bottom because so much less is expected of them and, when it comes to muck-slinging, they have no qualms about getting their hands dirty. </p> <p>Take Vietnam. At first sight this is an issue you would think the Bush administration would want to keep away from. Thanks to family connections, the president served his war in the Texas National Guard - and even then it is debatable whether he showed up. The vice-president, Dick Cheney, managed to defer being drafted five times, until the war was over, claiming he had \"other priorities\". Nine months and two days after the army changed the regulations so that married men with no children were no longer exempt, Cheney had his first child, Elizabeth, bringing a whole new meaning to the term family planning. </p> <p>Nobody is questioning their record in Vietnam for the simple reason that, unlike Kerry, neither them ever served there. For them to raise Kerry's service is a mixture of chutzpah and desperation that could backfire. Bush has tried to distance himself from the ads, saying they were put out by an independent group. But since the money trail leads back to his friends in Texas, this won't wash. </p> <p>The trouble for Kerry is that, in all likelihood, none of this will matter. The Bush campaign knows the attention span of the public is short and that few will sweat the details. Their hope is that by the time the claims of the Swift-boat Veterans have been discredited, a stubborn question mark will remain hanging over Kerry's military record. If you spread enough dung, goes the logic, then some seeds of doubt will grow. </p> <p>There is nothing new in this. The Bush team employed the same strategy in 2000 against Al Gore, forcing him to refute claims he never made about inventing the internet and being the basis for Love Story. In 2002, Republicans managed to unseat senator Max Cleland of Georgia by branding him unpatriotic because he opposed the creation of the homeland security department. Cleland lost three limbs in Vietnam and is a former head of the Veterans' Administration. </p> <p>But if the method of attack by Republicans is underhand, the issue they have chosen for this attack is understandable. For it was Kerry, not Bush, who placed his military service centre stage in this election campaign. The logic of doing so was clear enough. Clips of Kerry striding through the delta carrying a gun while his band of brothers (those who served with him) offered testimony of his heroics, served as a double whammy. They established Kerry in the public mind as a strong leader in wartime while providing a contrast with Bush, who stayed at home. </p> <p>But by the time of the Democratic convention, the party had elevated his service 35 years ago from one aspect of his personal history to his principle selling point in his campaign for the presidency. Refusing to spell out what plans he had for the future in Iraq or the war on terror, he was forced to exploit this one moment in his past for all it was worth. </p> <p>\"If we do not speak of it others will surely rewrite the script,\" said Vietnam veteran George Swiers shortly after returning. \"Each of the body bags, all of the mass graves will be reopened and their contents abracadabraed into a noble cause.\" </p> <p>And so it was that Kerry referred to his military service alone to qualify him for the presidency. He delivered a string of nationalist non sequiturs: \"As president, I will wage this war with the lessons I learned in war\"; \"I defended this country as a young man and I will defend it as president\"; and \"I learned a lot about these values on that gunboat patrolling the Mekong delta\". </p> <p>Then towards the end he reached for the stars and stripes. \"That flag flew from the turret right behind my head. And it was shot through and through and tattered, but it never ceased to wave in the wind. It draped the caskets of men that I served with and friends I grew up with.\" </p> <p>In so doing, Kerry may have neutralised charges that he will be weak on defence. But he also made his war record fair game and set the ground work for one of the most nationalistic elections in living memory: a campaign that offers the choice between a Republican candidate who wants America to be obeyed and a Democrat who wants it to be \"looked up to\" and become \"once again a beacon in the world\". </p> <p>Kerry is not only running for president, but in flight from a history he knows only too well. When he returned from Vietnam he testified before the Senate foreign relations committee that American troops had \"raped, cut off ears, cut off heads, taped wires from portable telephones to genitals and turned up the power, blown up bodies, randomly shot at civilians [and] razed villages in fashion reminiscent of Ganghis Khan.\" Just a few reasons why that beacon has burned so dimly for so long, and why Americans deserve a better choice. </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:g.younge@theguardian.com\">g.younge@theguardian.com</a></p>",
  "The row about John Kerry's war record became more heated yesterday with the resignation of a Bush campaign adviser on veterans' affairs and the publication of a personal account of the events that led to Senator Kerry being awarded a Silver Star. <p>Ken Cordier, a former Vietnam PoW, resigned from the Bush campaign after it emerged that he had appeared in a commercial made by the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, the group that has led the attacks. </p> <p>It gave further credence to suggestions, first aired in the New York Times on Friday, that the questioning of Mr Kerry's war record is tied to the White House. </p> <p>In a sign that Mr Kerry has been angered by the assault on his war record and the reticence of President Bush to condemn the group's attacks, the Democratic nominee released a TV commercial rebutting the charges. Noting that there are many problems facing the country in election year, including healthcare and Iraq, the commercial argued that \"instead of solutions, George Bush's campaign supports a smear group attacking John Kerry's war record ... Get back to the issues.\" </p> <p>But Mr Kerry received a fillip yesterday with the publication in the Chicago Tribune of a first-person article by a senior editor who commanded a swift (river patrol) boat alongside Mr Kerry. William Rood's account of the events preceding Mr Kerry's award back up the candidate's version. </p> <p>\"It's gotten harder and harder for those of us who were there to listen to accounts we know to be untrue, especially when they come from people who were not there,\" Mr Rood wrote in a sideswipe at the credentials of some of the members of Swift Boat Veterans for Truth. </p> <p>Mr Rood scorned one of the group's allegations: that Mr Kerry had not chased and killed a Vietcong soldier but a \"teenager in a loincloth\". </p> <p>\"He was a grown man, dressed in the kind of garb the VC usually wore.\" </p> <p>He highlighted the alleged inconsistencies of some of Mr Kerry's critics, pointing out that Roy Hoffmann, then a rear admiral, now a leading voice in the anti-Kerry veterans' group, had congratulated Mr Kerry on the day. </p> <p>At the weekend Mr Kerry told a fundraising event in East Hamptons: \"We're at war ... a different kind of war from any kind of war we've fought before, and it's because in the last months they [the Republicans] have seen me climbing in America's understanding that I know how to fight a smarter and more effective war.\" </p> <p>On Friday Mr Kerry complained to the federal election commission that the veterans' group had violated election law by coordinating its attacks with the White House. In turn, the White House spokesman, Scott McClellan, accused Mr Kerry of \"losing his cool\". </p> <p>The debate on Mr Kerry's war record has peaked just as the Republican party prepares for next week's convention, which is expected to portray George Bush as the only dependable leader in time of war. </p> <p>The attacks seem to have helped Mr Bush. Approval for Mr Kerry among Vietnam veterans has declined since the Democratic convention, which concentrated heavily on his war record. His decision to ignore them in the hope that they would fizzle out appears to have been a miscalculation.</p>"
