The Romney campaign produced multiple new web videos using footage from the debate.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>A debate broke out over whether Romney has the momentum in the race for the White House or whether he has never held the lead and even now is losing in the states that count.</strong> Both can't be right.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Gallup's tracking poll showed a 5-point gap with Romney in the lead.

Now he's just another partisan squabbler who, after he loses this election, will probably follow losers like Mike Huckabee and Al Gore into a career in cable punditry. Maybe get a time slot on MSNBC.</p> <p>This is (a dramatized version of) the case laid out by John Cook in a<a href=\"http://gawker.com/5954125/2008-called-it-wants-to-know-what-happened-to-barack-obama\"> lament </a>on Gawker reacting to Obama's joke last night that \"The 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back.\" Cook writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>That's a middling joke. It should by no means be coming from the president of the United States, let alone one who promised to put away childish things. It's a dumb \"zinger,\" transparently crafted to appeal to the Mark Halperins and Politicos of the world. That's not to say that humor has no place in political rhetoric or that Obama betrays his promise every time he deigns to insult his opponent. But to graft a pre-planned VH1 <em>Best Week Ever</em>-level joke onto a nationally televised discussion about life and death and our role on the world stage is scarcely less pathetic than the desperate flailings of the McCain campaign that I smugly scoffed at four years ago.</p> </blockquote> <p>Cook has a point, and it is this: the McCain campaign was capable of scoff-able flailing. Where Cook is wrong is in his earnest notion that a dumb debate joke sullies the presidential stole.</p> <p>In a tortured essay of personal disillusionment, Cook finds equal fault with Obama's recent stump speech laugh line about how Mitt Romney has so much trouble keeping track of his policy positions that he must be suffering from \"Romnesia.\" The pun, Cook writes, is \"too juvenile and jokey to be coming from the president.\"</p> <p>The attack over \"Romnesia\" is coming at the president today from the right, too:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/jpodhoretz/status/260760216608595968\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Please, would somebody who isn't simply an Obama fan explain to me why \"Romnesia\" is a smart, voter-getting crack?</p>&mdash; John Podhoretz (@jpodhoretz) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jpodhoretz/status/260760216608595968\" data-datetime=\"2012-10-23T15:10:54+00:00\">October 23, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure>  <p>First, here's why Obama says \"Romnesia\" on the stump:</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BBEXB1Wf9c\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8BBEXB1Wf9c?wmode=opaque&fs=1&feature=oembed&start=45\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>The crowd loves it.</p> <p>Politics plays out in arenas. Sometimes in stadiums. It increasingly plays out across social networks in which buzzy material spreads and boring material dies. The point is to win the crowd. Few politicians have been as good at it as Obama is. That YouTube clip has 400,000 views and change, and there are many vigorously viewed copies.</p> <p>Second, the notion that Obama has ever been above dumb jokes is a wrong notion. This is a president who, talking about a regulation that classifies milk as oil, said, in a State of the Union address: \"I guess it was worth crying over spilled milk.\" Michelle had <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdjwD2LEGOo\">to close her eyes</a> at that one.</p> <p>This is a president who cannot resist <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=fzpcgRfc0CI\">dumb baseball jokes</a>, and dumb jokes about how he finds it reassuring that his daughters, as they approach dating age, are in the constant company of men with guns.</p> <p>But in Cook's eyes the dumb debate joke is only a symptom of a larger affliction. Obama, he writes, has lost the \"sense of himself as the adult in the room.\"</p> <p>Obama may have adjusted his rhetorical style from 2008. It would be an occasion for unearthly discomfort had he not. Obama cannot, in 2012, stand behind a lectern and say, \"We are the change we've been waiting for.\" He said that before he was elected as the nation's first black president. He said that at the end of eight long years of George W. Bush. It was a statement of patent truth whose force has dissipated as the novelty of Obama's first candidacy has turned into the reality of his presidency.</p> <p>A couple dumb jokes aren't ruinous to the Obama brand, because the brand is no longer built on the promise of a more adult politics. It's now built on the health care law, the withdrawal of troops from Iraq and a cold-blooded policy of assassination by flying robot. It's built on getting slapped around by Republicans in Congress. If he doesn't win re-election, it will be built next to Jimmy Carter's retirement home.</p> <p>Grown-ups don't judge Obama on his jokes. They judge him on his record.</p> <p>P.S. And also, let's not forget what aggressively dumb political speech actually sounds like:</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3VXXN-fF2A\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/b3VXXN-fF2A?wmode=opaque&fs=1&feature=oembed&start=20\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-23T21:01:11.662Z\">at 10.01pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5086d6b5c0e376c4a1112e39\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-23T17:41:09.365Z\">6.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Obama narrows gap in Gallup poll</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The president is on the improve in Gallup's national 7-day tracking poll, in which he has recently trailed by as many as 7 points among likely voters.</p> <p>Today Gallup <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/home.aspx\">finds</a> a 5-point margin, with Romney out front 51-46 among likely voters.

It's Tuesday, with two (2) weeks to go before election day. Here's a summary of where things stand:</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Governor Romney and President Obama met on a Florida stage last night to debate foreign policy, a topic that turned out to encompass the state of Wisconsin's schools and of Detroit's car factories.</strong> The foreign policy discussion centered on the Middle East and North Africa: Iran, Israel, Syria, Libya, Iraq, Egypt.&#xa0;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/NickKristof/status/260569672213217280\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Foreign policy debate spent more time on Israel than on Europe, India and Africa combined. That's not our world.</p>&mdash; Nicholas Kristof (@NickKristof) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NickKristof/status/260569672213217280\" data-datetime=\"2012-10-23T02:33:45+00:00\">October 23, 2012</a></blockquote> </figure>  <p>\u2022 <strong>Who \"won\"?</strong> The snap polls picked the president. <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/10/22/cnn-poll-who-won-the-debate/?hpt=hp_t1\">CNN</a> found Obama out front 48-40; <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57537795/poll-decisive-win-for-obama-in-final-debate/?tag=MaxDeep\">CBS</a> found Obama on top 53-23 with 24% of respondents calling the debate a \"tie\".</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Obama repeatedly accused Romney of being \"all over the map\" with his stated policy positions, and indeed Romney had significantly amended his stances on core questions of war and peace from what they were two weeks ago.</strong> Questions like should the US have kept tens of thousands of troops in Iraq and should we commit to leaving Afghanistan by 2014. Voters who care where the Republican candidate stands will have to guess.&#xa0;</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>The anticipated debate over the administration's arguably poor handling of the aftermath of the attack in Benghazi, Libya, on September 11 never materialized.</strong> Obama was not pressed to explain why there was not more security in place at the US mission or why the White House originally peddled a false version of events.&#xa0;</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Romney said the Middle East had slid toward chaos under the Obama administration.</strong> He said Iran is \"four years closer\" to a nuclear weapon and al-Qaida is resurgent in North Africa. Romney's best line: \"We can't kill our way out of this mess.\"&#xa0;</p> <p>\u2022 A<strong>part from his utter aqueousness on policy, Romney came in for criticism for seeming lightweight or unpracticed next to the president in discussing how to steer the ship of state.</strong> Romney laid out a bullet-point prescription for intervention in Syria that sounded like the work of a management consultant proposing to fix Acme, Inc. Romney stutteringly confused Iran and Iraq, and he said that Syria was the non-contiguous Persian Gulf state of Iran's \"route to the sea\". He ventured criticism of the president's record but seemed unable to imbue his critique with the force of knowledge or vision or belief.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>There were zingers.&#xa0;</strong></p> <p>Obama: \"In the 1980s, they're now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because you know, the cold war's been over for 20 years.\"&#xa0;</p> <p>Romney: \"I congratulate him on taking out Osama bin Laden and going after the leadership in al-Qaida. But we can't kill our way out of this mess.\"&#xa0;</p> <p>Obama: \"You mentioned the navy, for example, and that we have fewer ships than we did in 1916. Well, governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military's changed.\"</p> </div>   </div>",

For example, in the section on \"protecting social security\", there is no mention of Romney-Ryan policies. But there is a promise to \"stop proposals to turn Medicare into a voucher system\", a reference to one version of Romney/Ryan proposed reforms.</p> <p>The document is a clear attempt to rebut criticism that Obama has failed to offer an agenda for a second term. But much of the \"plan\" is really a restatement of the Obama administration's positions, achievements or policy aspirations. Hence the section on healthcare, titled \"putting you in charge of your health care,\" has a quote from Obama warning of the consequences of scrapping what the plan calls Obamacare, two paragraphs of background, five paragraphs of existing Obamacare benefits, and then ends with a \"policy box\" summary:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Obamacare is working to rein in insurance companies and give people more control over their health care. Starting in 2014, the Obamacare Law:</p> <p>1. Ensures that all Americans can purchase health coverage, even if they have a pre-existing condition.</p> <p>2. Creates a marketplace that offers group rates and new tax credits so everyone can afford insurance.</p> <p>3. Prohibits discrimination in premiums so women don't pay up to 50% more for the same policy as men.</p> <p>4. Further cuts taxes for small businesses to cover 50% of their premiums.</p> </blockquote> <p>There is nothing in those proposals that is new, which explains why today Obama's senior advisor David Axelrod described it as the plan that Obama has been \"running on and talking about for months, in written form.\"</p> <p>The single mention of Mitt Romney by name comes in the most conventional part of the document: a small panel offering a side by side comparison between \"Tax Savings Under Obama\" versus \"Tax Increase Under Romney,\" itself using familiar figures of a $3,600 tax cut for a \"typical family\" under Obama compared with an estimated $2,000 tax increase on \"middle class families with kids\" under Romney.</p> <p>The concentration on Obama, rather than attacking Romney, at such a late stage of the election cycle suggests a nervousness about what George HW Bush once derided as \"the vision thing\". Meanwhile, the subject headings betray where the Obama campaign feels it needs to more vigorously compete with Romney: the headings \"Building an Economy from the Middle Class Out\" jostles alongside \"A Tax Plan That Cuts the Deficit and Creates Jobs\" to produce \"Improve Education for Middle-Class Jobs\".</p> <p>After four years as president Obama does have a record to run on, rather than the vague policies that appear from the Romney campaign. But if there's a big difference it's in the modesty of Obama's plan. While Romney is chock full of impressive boasts \u2013 12m more jobs, tax cuts for all, a bigger military and a lower deficit \u2013 the Obama effort is muted. The new plan also does mention 12m new jobs in the next four years \u2013 but undercuts that by noting this is what \"independent economists\" have projected will happen anyway.</p>",
  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/us-elections-2012\" title=\"\">Whoever runs Washington</a> heads a global empire. American politics affects people's lives in every part of the world, often as a matter of life or death. So it's&#xa0;scarcely surprising that <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/105943470/UPI-CVoter-Global-Poll-9-11\" title=\"\">more than 40% of those polled around the world</a> say they want the right to vote&#xa0;in US presidential elections.</p> <p>After all, the American revolution was fought on the slogan of \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_taxation_without_representation\" title=\"\">no taxation&#xa0;without representation</a>\". So long as the US government arrogates to itself the right to impose its \"leadership\"&#xa0;by force across the world, a contemporary version of the colonists' demand might be: \"no global power without accountability\".</p> <p>And with George Bush's blood-drenched presidency still fresh in the memory, it's only to be expected that 81% want to see the less belligerent Barack Obama re-elected. Only in Pakistan, target of relentless civilian-slaughtering US drone attacks, do a <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2012/10/23/poll-finds-20-of-21-countries-strongly-prefer-obama-exception-pakistan/\" title=\"\">larger number prefer his Republican opponent, Mitt Romney</a>.</p> <p>Of course, enfranchising foreigners is fantasy. Only US citizens will have a say in these elections, and barely half of them are likely to bother to vote. Their choice will be made overwhelmingly on domestic issues, not how the administration should deploy its fearsome arsenal on the other side of the world.</p> <p>The race is tight mainly because the economy is still hobbled and <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/150122/americans-access-basic-necessities-recession-level.aspx\" title=\"\">poverty has risen 19% since 2000</a>. But for all Obama's disappointments and an electoral system in the grip of the wealthy, the domestic choice is real enough: from spending and taxes to healthcare and abortion \u2013 facing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2012/oct/05/romney-47-percent-remarks-history-video\" title=\"\">a challenger who thinks 47% of Americans are scroungers</a>.</p> <p>But for most of Monday night's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/us-presidential-debates\" title=\"\">candidates' TV debate on foreign policy</a>, it was hard to put a credit card between them. They competed to demonstrate unconditional commitment to Israel, determination to prevent Iran developing nuclear weapons at all costs and their firm intention to compel China to \"play by the rules\".</p> <p>Romney had sharply toned down his more menacing rhetoric. Apart from grumbling about Obama's lack of \"strong leadership\", his inner hawk only really broke cover to insist on direct arming of the Syrian rebels and the necessity of yet further deficit-defying increases in the already gargantuan US military budget.</p> <p>At one point the Republican rightwinger even criticised Obama for behaving as if the US could \"kill our way out of this mess\" in the Muslim world. That&#xa0;shouldn't be taken too literally. If&#xa0;nothing else, the experience of Bush \u2013 who presented himself as a compassionate conservative with a \"humble foreign&#xa0;policy\" in 2000 and went on to launch the most devastating war of aggression in modern American history \u2013&#xa0;is an object lesson.</p> <p>But Romney's determination to shake off his image as a warmonger reflects the need at least to nod to US public opinion. Unlike the Washington establishment, <a href=\"http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-10-16/news/ct-nw-global-attitudes-poll-20121016_1_survey-paints-picture-foreign-policy-military-action\" title=\"\">large majorities of Americans</a> believe neither the Iraq nor Afghanistan wars were worth fighting, polling shows; more than three-quarters think the US plays \"world policeman\" more than it should; and most want military spending cut, reject a US strike on Iran, and oppose arming Syria's opposition. But that also underlines how little influence most people in the US (as in Britain) have on their government's foreign policy and military adventures.</p> <p>For all Obama's tone of reason and his stand against the Iraq war, his record is anything but pacific. He accelerated withdrawal from Iraq, but escalated the war in Afghanistan and failed to subdue armed resistance, at a cost of thousands of extra deaths. He sharply intensified the drone war in Pakistan, spreading it to Somalia and Yemen, personally vetting the \"kill lists\" while expanding \"legitimate targets\" to include all military-age males.</p> <p>He backed Nato's war in Libya, ratcheting up the death toll at least tenfold and unleashing mass ethnic cleansing; supported the suppression of Gulf protest; and managed a violent coup in Honduras to a \"successful conclusion\". With a little help from Congress, he reneged on his pledge to close the Guant\u00e1namo internment camp, acquiesced in Israel's refusal to end illegal colonisation of Palestinian territory, and has now dispatched US troops to sub-Saharan Africa and Jordan.</p> <p>Whatever the personal views of the politician at the top, the US empire is a system, not a policy, underpinned by corporate and military interests. Romney would very likely be a more dangerous leader, but almost every US president has sanctioned military action, and the risk of war with Iran or growing intervention in Syria would remain under a second Obama term.</p> <p>But it's also a system in evident decline, hastened by overreach in the war on terror and paid for in blood and treasure both by Americans and across the world. US military spending is larger than the combined spending of the next 20 powers combined, its troops stationed in a majority of countries.</p> <p>Of course the rest of the world doesn't really want a vote in American elections but the US off its back. Far better for most Americans, too, if that bloated military budget were to be slashed, troops withdrawn and bases closed \u2013 and the money spent instead on jobs, schools and health in the US itself.</p> <p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"http://\" title=\"\"><em>@SeumasMilne</em></a></p>",
  "<p>Actors and comedians lauded the television pioneer Ellen DeGeneres for her comedic and cultural contributions on Monday night, at a ceremony to commemorate her reception of the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor.</p> <p>The ceremony commemorating DeGeneres' win of the top comedy award in the US will air on PBS. DeGeneres, 54, was quick to joke about Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney's plans to stop funding the public television network. </p> <p>\"Thanks to everyone at PBS. I am so happy to be part of your farewell season,\" she said.</p> <p>DeGeneres usually steers clear of political comedy but during the ceremony she was lauded for helping to establish gay characters in mainstream culture. In 1997, DeGeneres came out publicly \u2013 her eponymous sitcom character, Ellen, came out shortly after. It was the first time a lead character had come out as gay on primetime television. </p> <p>The show suffered a serious ratings decline and was cancelled in 1998. She then appeared in shows and films before re-establishing her star power as the host of The Ellen DeGeneres Show and voicing Dory in the film Finding Nemo. </p> <p>Glee's Jane Lynch and Sean Hayes, formerly of Will and Grace, credited Ellen for making it possible for their shows to include gay characters.</p> <p>\"I'm pretty darn sure I could not have the career I have, that I could not live as openly as I've lived, if it hadn't been for you,\" Lynch said. </p> <p>Fellow television host and comedian Jimmy Kimmel said DeGeneres' coming-out had been a milestone. </p> <p>\"For a lot of people, Ellen is their only homosexual friend,\" Kimmel said. \"She's there in their living room every single day.\"</p> <p>DeGeneres has hosted 10 seasons of The Ellen DeGeneres Show, which has won 35 Daytime Emmy Awards since its 2003 debut. She began her comedy career in her hometown of New Orleans and received her first big break performing on The Tonight Show starring Johnny Carson in 1986. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YIAAI3j_vsY?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/YIAAI3j_vsY\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><br><em>Ellen DeGeneres: The Kennedy Center Mark Twain Prize will air 30 October at 8pm ET on PBS.</em></p>",

Now he's just another partisan squabbler who, after he loses this election, will probably follow losers like Mike Huckabee and Al Gore into a career in cable punditry. Maybe get a time slot on MSNBC.</p> <p>This is (a dramatized version of) the case <a href=\"http://gawker.com/5954125/2008-called-it-wants-to-know-what-happened-to-barack-obama\">laid out by John Cook in a lament on Gawker</a> reacting to Obama's joke last night that \"the 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back.\" Cook writes:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>That's a middling joke. It should by no means be coming from the president of the United States, let alone one who promised to put away childish things. It's a dumb \"zinger,\" transparently crafted to appeal to the Mark Halperins and Politicos of the world.</p> <p>That's not to say that humor has no place in political rhetoric or that Obama betrays his promise every time he deigns to insult his opponent. But to graft a pre-planned VH1 Best Week Ever-level joke onto a nationally televised discussion about life and death and our role on the world stage is scarcely less pathetic than the desperate flailings of the McCain campaign that I smugly scoffed at four years ago.</p> </blockquote> <p>Cook has a point, and it is this: the McCain campaign was capable of scoff-able flailing. Where Cook is wrong is in his earnest notion that a dumb debate joke sullies the presidential stole.</p> <p>In a tortured essay of personal disillusionment, Cook finds equal fault with Obama's recent stump speech laugh line about how Mitt Romney has so much trouble keeping track of his policy positions that he must be suffering from \"Romnesia.\" The pun, Cook writes, is \"too juvenile and jokey to be coming from the president.\"</p> <p>But politics plays out in arenas. Sometimes in stadiums. It increasingly plays out across social networks in which buzzy material spreads and boring material dies. The point is to win the crowd.

  "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/yulia-tymoshenko\" title=\"\">Yulia Tymoshenko</a>, heroine of the \"<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orange_Revolution\" title=\"\">orange revolution</a>\" and one of the few women ever to achieve prime ministerial office in the former Soviet republics, is not allowed to stand in Ukraine's current national election. For the last <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/29/yulia-tymoshenko-video-appeal-prison\" title=\"\">15 months she has been in prison</a>, convicted for actions that would not amount to a crime in any other democracy. She is subjected to the grossest invasion of her privacy (almost every movement she makes is videoed) and constantly defamed by the president and his tame prosecutors. Europe seems to have abandoned her; but tomorrow, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-19395563\" title=\"\">at the UN's human rights committee</a>, the UK can bring her situation to the world's attention.</p> <p>Her innocence of any real crime is clear from the judgments at her trial and final appeal. She was <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15250742\" title=\"\">convicted of the vague charge of \"abuse of office\"</a> by reaching a deal with Putin which resolved a gas crisis in January 2009 that risked causing deaths in central Europe. Russia had cut off gas to Ukraine \u2013 and through it, to a number of countries \u2013 and was going to continue doing so unless transportation charges were increased. With the encouragement of the EU and Angela Merkel, Tymoshenko flew to Moscow and reached a compromise.</p> <p>Her opponents thought she should have held out for better terms. The issue&#xa0;was fully canvassed over the next&#xa0;few months in the presidential election, in which she was narrowly beaten by Viktor Yanukovych (winner of&#xa0;the rigged&#xa0;2004 election that the orange revolution overturned).</p> <p>An example of functioning democracy, you might think. But not in Ukraine, where Tymoshenko was then prosecuted. It was not suggested she had made a penny out of the gas deal, or had been dishonest or criminal in any accepted sense of that word. Her crime, according to her judge, was that she had \"acted in her personal interests, desiring to create for herself the image of an efficient leader of its state who could deal with the gas crisis shortly before the presidential elections\". In other words, she had acted as any other populist leader in a democracy \u2013 she had resolved a crisis, then submitted herself and her conduct to the electorate. The charge had been used by the regime to silence a political opponent.</p> <p>Ukraine maintains the Stalinist system whereby the prosecution service (its top officials appointed by the president) controls the courts. Its judges have no independence. This can be proven by a single statistic: the conviction rate in criminal cases is an incredible 99.8%. On his appointment, Tymoshenko's prosecutor, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Pshonka\" title=\"\">Viktor Pshonka</a>, declared himself \"on the president's team\" and his deputy appears regularly on TV to defame her. If judges rule against the prosecution in a political trial, it then prosecutes them for the offence of being untrue to their oath. They do not have tenure until they serve loyally for five years. As European human rights officials point out, this sword of Damocles makes these \"P-plate judges\" do whatever the prosecution wants.</p> <p>The Tymonshenko trial is a classic example. Her judge, only two years in office, was plucked from a small town court and given the most important trial in Ukraine's history. He showed his colours (they were not orange) by a brutal and unnecessary decision, early in the trial, to put Tymoshenko in prison. Her sentence \u2013 seven years and an order to pay $186m \u2013 was calculated to destroy her. And all for acting as a prime minister should, to avert a humanitarian crisis in central Europe.</p> <p>Once, Stalinist systems delivered \"telephone justice\" \u2013 a call to the judge from the party boss. In Ukraine today, it is \"megaphone justice\": the president and his prosecutors publicly declared Tymoshenko guilty before her trial, and a lickspittle judge then did their bidding.</p> <p>The Council of Europe has passed motions condemning her treatment but has done nothing to sanction her persecutors or to suspend Ukraine's membership. When Britain speaks at the UN, it must make clear that Yulia Tymoshenko has become Europe's Aung San Suu Kyi.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 24 October 2012. The original said incorrectly that Tymoshenko was the only woman ever to achieve prime ministerial office in the former Soviet republics.</p>",
  "<p>The US presidential campaign still has two weeks to run, but it is already possible to say that whichever man wins, democracy will be one of the losers. There has of course never ever been a perfectly fair and honest election in any of the countries which claim the democratic title. Dirty tricks are part of the process, understood, fallen for, seen through, and sometimes even relished by the voters. Trollope wrote of an election agent profoundly puzzled by the proposition that bribing citizens with free beer was in some way unethical, while Mark Twain satirically advised politicians to \"Get the facts first. You can distort them later.\"</p> <p>Yet the failings evident in the American contest this time may be of a new order, and they could be critical. To put it at its simplest, the election is so close that its outcome may be determined by whether the lies told during the campaign, above all by the Republican side, stick or not. Because the candidates are so close, because the country has been so submerged by wave after wave of negative advertising, and because the falsehoods and unacknowledged shifts of position have come so thick and fast, mendacity could triumph over merit. If it does so, it will be because democracy's main tool for checking deception, the media, have fallen short of their duties. When politicians find they can make assertions and perpetrate falsehood without fear of being exposed, or at least of being exposed in front of the broader public, some of them will do so.</p> <p>The reasons are various. Elements of the American media, like Fox News, are partisan to the point of outright distortion, while others are hampered by what Paul Krugman has called the \"cult of balance\", refusing to directly contest misleading statements by politicians and instead only offering the other side the opportunity of rebuttal, or leaving to columnists and commentators the task of judging political assertions. Contradicting politicians in news stories was not done. Barack Obama has himself justifiably complained of <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/photos-and-video/video/2012/04/03/president-obama-speaks-associated-press-luncheon#transcript\" title=\"\">\"false balance\"</a>, implying that this so-called \"he said, she said\" narrative, ostensibly even-handed, misleads, confuses and bores the citizen. Both partisanship and the problem of false equivalence, assigning equal weight to each side's position in the search for balance, have contributed to a steep decline in trust in the accuracy of reports in the American <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2009/09/13/press-accuracy-rating-hits-two-decade-low/\" title=\"\">media.</a></p> <p>The United States is not alone in these developments, but it is, unfortunately, further down this road than other nations in the democratic family. Where the partisan press cannot be trusted to check the facts offered by the politicians they favour or accept the versions offered by those they do not, and the more independent or liberal press will not do so in either case, democracy is clearly in trouble.</p> <p>It is true that, as the campaign has run its course, some American journalists have raised their game, nudged along, in part, by the social media. Political assertions have been contested in news stories, while one moderator, Candy Crowley, brusquely contradicted Mitt Romney in the second presidential debate when he tried to maintain that Mr Obama had not termed the attack on the Benghazi consulate <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/17/candy-crowley-republicans-benghazi-interjection\" title=\"\">an act of terror</a>. The stunned expression on Mr Romney's face when she did so showed, however, how rare such interventions remain. Republicans then heaped abuse on her, helped by the fact that she was herself guilty of an error, although a lesser one.</p> <p>Whatever the rights or wrongs of that incident, the fact checkers have got their act together rather late in the day. American voters will thus soon be deciding on issues that have been presented to them in a particularly distorted way, and making a judgment on character clouded by the way in which one candidate, Mr Romney, has segued from the aggressive right of the spectrum to somewhere near the centre, particularly in foreign policy, as Monday night's debate showed.</p> <p>Emerson said that if you threw a fact out of the window you would come back later to find it sitting in the chimney corner. But that might well be after you had voted.</p>",
  "<p>If Mitt Romney is elected president of the United States on 6 November \u2013 an outcome which is no longer the statistical implausibility it once was \u2013 then historians will say it was the October debate season, that turned it around.</p> <p>Before he came face to face with Barack Obama in Denver three weeks ago, Romney existed in much of the American public mind as a cartoonish figure, a comic-book plutocrat so rich his wife had two Cadillacs and his cars had an elevator of their own. Extravagantly out of touch, he was \"Mittens\", the pampered son of privilege who refused to come clean about his taxes and whose personal rate <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2012/09/21/pf/taxes/romney-tax-return/index.html\" title=\"\">turned out to be a measly 14%</a>. Ideologically, he was either unpalatably extreme \u2013 a \"severe conservative\" by his own description, whose message to America's undocumented immigrants was that they should \"self-deport\" \u2013 or an insincere flip-flopper who had reversed countless previous positions \u2013 first supporting, then opposing, abortion rights, for instance \u2013 to curry favour with the hardcore faithful who pick Republican presidential candidates.</p> <p>And he was useless to boot: clumsily embarking on a summer overseas tour that alienated a string of allies, including Britain, whose imminent Olympics he hinted would be a flop. As late as September his candidacy seemed doomed to failure. He had condemned himself out of his own mouth, thanks to a covert video of a fundraising speech in which he wrote off 47% of the American electorate as feckless parasites who would never vote for him anyway.</p> <p>The conventional wisdom deemed Romney perhaps the most inept nominee of a major party ever to seek the presidency. Obama was on course for a blowout, tipped to retake states that, when he won them in 2008, had seemed like an unrepeatable fluke.</p> <p>But that was before the debate season. Now that it's over, with Monday's encounter the last time the two men will clash directly, the landscape looks utterly different. Before the first debate on 3 October, the national poll average showed Obama consistently ahead, usually with a four-point cushion. Now Romney has a lead: tiny, but a lead.</p> <p>Obama's cheerleaders used to point to his \"firewall\", his advantage in the key nine or 11 swing states. But now the uber-pollster Nate Silver deems that firewall \"brittle\", Obama's previous edge in Florida, Colorado and Virginia steadily melting away. Today a different Romney has succeeded in lodging himself in the public imagination: sane, reasonable, even moderate.</p> <p>He seems energetic and capable, his experience in business no longer a liability \u2013 evoking questions about the vulture-like conduct of his private equity company, Bain Capital, along with his record of outsourcing American jobs \u2013 but an asset, a qualification for turning around the ailing enterprise that is USA, Inc.</p> <p>Monday's performance completed that new picture. Democrats had been painting Romney as the heir to George Bush, noting the hawks and <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/22/heilbrunn-neocons-idUSL1E8LMFS620121022\" title=\"\">neo-conservative outriders who form his circle of foreign policy advisers</a>. That left the Republican with a single task for a debate dedicated to international affairs: he needed to reassure the American people that he was no warmonger, out to reshape the world with US force, but a cool-headed realist. Accordingly, he lashed himself to his opponent, offering a me-too echo of Obama's foreign policy. He too would withdraw troops from Afghanistan by 2014. He too had no plans to intervene militarily in Syria. He too regarded war to halt a nuclear Iran as a \"last resort\". Why, the only differences were ones of style: he would show Vladimir Putin \"backbone\", rather than the \"flexibility\" Obama had promised. And he would never apologise for America, or say it had dictated to other nations. Instead he declared \u2013 in what was his best moment, one already spliced into a new TV commercial \u2013 \"Mr President, America has not dictated to other nations. We have freed other nations from dictators.\"</p> <p>Most neutrals gave the debate to Obama, either on points or more convincingly, who regularly exposed Romney's inconsistency on Afghanistan, Iraq and Iran \u2013 \"you've been all over the map\" \u2013 and used humour to devastating effect when he rebutted the Republican's lament that the US Navy had fewer ships now than at any time since 1917. Obama's reply: \"Governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military's changed.\" But for Romney, none of that much mattered. He was not aiming for a win; he merely needed to avoid disaster. As David Frum, former speechwriter to Bush, tweeted: \"Romney reassured voters who fear he might be too hawkish; otherwise gave nobody reason to vote against him. Mission accomplished.\"</p> <p>That goes for the whole debate season. Romney needed to use October to transform himself from a near joke-figure into a plausible president \u2013 and he did. That's why Republicans like to recall Ronald Reagan in 1980. Early that autumn, too many voters regarded Reagan as unfit or too extreme to be president. But during the TV debates, Reagan laid their fears to rest. This autumn also began with the US electorate disappointed in the occupant of the Oval Office. But it first needed to be reassured that it was safe to vote for the alternative. Romney may have lost two out of the three debates but it doesn't matter \u2013 he did what he needed to do. Now a campaign that began nearly two years ago enters its final stretch. There will be no more grand set pieces, just the hard graft of on-the-ground organisation, as both parties sweat to get out their vote \u2013 with all eyes on one must-win state.</p> <p>\"It will all come down to Ohio,\" says one former Democratic strategist close to the Obama campaign. \"Both know it. And it will be a district by district street fight.\" While Romney looks to energise miners in the south of the state, Obama's hopes will rest on bailed-out car workers in the north. America's future now rests in the narrow statistical space the pollsters call the margin of error.</p>",
  "<p>By this point in the US election, with all the meat having been chewed well off the bone at least seven months ago and most voters having made up their minds about two years ago, the next two and a bit weeks consists, for voters and politicians alike, of about 80% spin and 20% tea-leaf reading. I'm not a great fan of spin, not because I'm whiter than white but because I have low blood pressure and spinning makes me dizzy so let's all have a nice cup of tea and read them leaves. Specifically, the debate leaves.</p> <p>The last of the cumbersome presidential debates lumbered to a close on Monday night and while the cool kids (well, cynical commentators, anyway, and in the cool-starved arena of political reporters, that comes to the same thing) like to say that debates are more for the media and make no difference to voters, that isn't entirely true. It is axiomatic that few Romney supporters will be persuaded to change sides just because President Obama made <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1012/82730.html\" title=\"\">a good joke about bayonets</a> (it is also axiomatic that I'll seize any excuse to use the word \"axiomatic\"). But as an astonished electorate saw in the first debate \u2013 AKA, the debate that Obama didn't so much as phone in as text in \u2013 if a previously down-and-out candidate performs unexpectedly well, his ensuing confidence can energise previously apathetic voters to join in the fun.</p> <p>But the reductive question of who won the debates (Obama, just) is not the only reading one can glean from them. Rather, these debates look, in the sharp glare of hindsight, oddly prophetic for both candidates, mirrroring, for one, the trajectory of his campaign and, for the other, the&#xa0;rhythm of his presidency.</p> <p>Mitt Romney had a tougher time in the primaries than he should have done considering his rivals seemed at times to have only recently emerged from either <a href=\"http://www.ricksantorum.com/\" title=\"\">the 1950s</a> or <a href=\"http://www.newt.org/\" title=\"\">the swamp</a>, but he always came across as the inevitable candidate and he, inevitably, triumphed. But in the second stage of the election when the focus was only on him, he became little more than <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RHaMqHh5NZ4\" title=\"\">one awkward stumble</a>, a giant <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/us-news-blog/2012/jul/26/mitt-romney-britain-gaffes\" title=\"\">Romneyshambles</a>, and every time he tried to fight against this, he stumbled more. This pattern was echoed in the debates, in that he won the first over a weak opponent and then collapsed in the second, collapsing further with each desperate fightback such as in <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/16/candy-crowley-fact-checks-mitt-romney-libya_n_1972313.html\" title=\"\">his last gasp arguments</a> about when Obama described the Benghazi attack an \"act of&#xa0;terror\".</p> <p>Similarly, President Obama arrived in office in 2009 clearly just wanting to get on with his job and underestimating, damagingly for him, the vitriol of the other side, which was determined to make his job as hard as possible. He eventually came to terms with the idea of getting his cerebral hands dirty but many felt it was too late. So it went in the debates, with a first appearance that was so lacklustre it gave some liberal commentators <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/03/chris-matthews-obama-debate_n_1937950.html\" title=\"\">near coronaries on air</a> and a second appearance that showed a fightback, but one that felt disappointingly belated. So for Obama to squeak ahead in the final debate corroborates <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/22/oct-21-uncertainty-clouds-polling-but-obama-remains-electoral-college-favorite/\" title=\"\">the view of Nate Silver</a>, one of America's most respected statisticians and political predictors, that the president will, just about, slip on through to a second term.</p> <p>And the performances of the candidates in the debates suggested why. Romney is a man born to be president \u2013 at least, that's what he's been telling himself for the past 50 years, especially when he looks in his bathroom mirror and sees <a href=\"http://www.mittromney.com/forms/welcome-0\" title=\"\">a face that is so presidential</a> it could have come from central casting. So when he feels that things are going his way, he gains confidence, reaching for his destiny. But when he senses an unacceptable obstacle in his path <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/mitt-romneys-prep-school-classmates-recall-pranks-but-also-troubling-incidents/2012/05/10/gIQA3WOKFU_story_1.html\" title=\"\">the bullying teenager that he was</a> rises to the fore, pettily arguing with the moderators about how much time he has been given to answer and making blustering, misguided comments about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/us-news-blog/2012/oct/17/mitt-romney-binders-full-of-women\" title=\"\">binders</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-20037307\" title=\"\">boats</a>.</p> <p>These bullying, blundering tendencies seem to be genetic, seeing as Romney's son Tagg <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/mckaycoppins/tagg-romney-wanted-to-take-a-swing-at-obama-duri\" title=\"\">said in an interview</a> that watching the debates made him \"want to take a swing\" at Obama. Romney also struggled during the debates against two greater opponents than Obama: the Republican party and himself. He struggled, especially in the last debate, to balance the hardline demands of his party with the more centrist tendencies of the general public. As for Romney v Romney, his own words from the past were repeatedly used against him and these were often more effective than anything Obama said.</p> <p>Obama came across as he generally always has done: equipped with a plan, generally calm but occasionally testy, and intelligent if not especially empathetic. Most of all, he came across as disgusted with the competition on which he is forced to waste his time and while that may be an understandable reaction, it is not an especially helpful one.</p> <p>How these debates will be remembered is not dependent on the debates themselves but what happens on 6 November. Either they will prove the cool kids right and debates make no difference at all, or they will be seen as the election's turning point. As Al Gore and Jimmy Carter learned to their misfortune, debates can, as it happens, turn an election. Sometimes, as Mr Cool himself, Obama, proved in the first debate, the cool kids can get it wrong.</p>",
  "<p>Is Jimmy Savile and the BBC the biggest story on Earth? Apparently so. Today the British media placed it above Romney versus Obama, above the implosion of Lebanon and above the birth of the world's largest oil company. Savile was bigger than killer drones in Lincolnshire, bigger than Cameron's prison policy, bigger than the sensational Birmingham terrorism trial. The mere \"standing down\" of the editor of Newsnight led the BBC news, as if the corporation had sub-contracted itself to its house journal, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/ariel/\" title=\"\">Ariel</a>.</p> <p>While Britain's domestic and overseas predicament cries out for clarity from those who purvey public information, the purveyors have lost all proportion. The media has gone collectively tabloid. Savile clearly did terrible things to young people, which authorities failed to notice or investigate. But he is dead, damned, gone for ever.</p> <p>Those who promoted and, to some degree, protected Savile, which included the BBC, the NHS and some charities, bear a portion of the culpability for the harm he caused to young people. It is right that they come clean and apologise on Savile's behalf to those who suffered. It is also right that they review how his doings were concealed and, in the BBC's case, how a programme about him was not aired. That is happening.</p> <p>This does not make the BBC's director general, George Entwistle, a manager of a paedophile ring, or an appeaser of sexual harassment, as implied by much of today's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/23/bbc-newsnight-jimmy-savile\" title=\"\">questioning by the Commons culture committee</a>. His artlessness seemed honest and was plausible. What&#xa0;appeared a conspiracy over the cancelling of Newsnight was, on his evidence, a regretable cock-up.</p> <p>The trouble is that the media hates cock-ups as they dilute guilt. A mistake must be rendered a lie, a cover-up and a crisis, so that the cry can go up for heads to roll. As we saw <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/oct/19/andrew-mitchell-resigns-police-pleb\" title=\"\">in the Andrew Mitchell case</a>, when the blood is up, nothing will satisfy the political community but a body in the street. Entwistle gave the appearance of a man who can count angels on the head of a BBC pin, but is at a loss to notice when the pin is skewering him. He now knows&#xa0;what it was like to be James Murdoch in the same seat last&#xa0;spring, giving much the same answers, if less&#xa0;elegantly.</p> <p>The BBC is an archetypal case of corporate elephantiasis, an organisation too big to take clear and swift decisions. Its&#xa0;senior managers are lost in a corporate maze of directorates, divisions, Chinese walls and spectrums of delegation. He could not begin to explain how an \"editor-in-chief\" was not a chief editor, or how the head of television was not, in fact, the head of television. The BBC makes the Vatican seem like a corner shop.</p> <p>The corporation may be commended for the vigour with which its disparate empire, from news to Panorama, reported on the miseries of its elders. But if there is one group that BBC journalists hate even more than the Murdoch family, it is their own bosses. For two days, the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/default.stm\" title=\"\">Today</a> radio programme revelled in their distress. Its presenters could not stop talking about it, hauling in fellow employees to declare the crisis \"the worst in 50 years\", and their superiors to be \"close to toast\".</p> <p>The reality is that the BBC's survival depends on its self-abasement. Given its unique status as a statutory body and its near monopoly of broadcast news, anything less than total disclosure would be inexcusable. Jimmy Savile mesmerised the BBC in life, as now he does in death. Its metropolitan programmers indulged him outrageously, assuming him to be the authentic voice of working-class eccentricity. Their problem was that they could not tell a Savile from a Cilla&#xa0;Black.</p> <p>It is hard to see what real benefit will come from any of this. The case is awash in malice, vilification, exaggeration and litigation. After today's grilling, the BBC might well decide never again to let a child near a male studio presenter. Hospitals will be advised to recruit chaperones for males in children's wards. MPs would apparently deplore anyone permitting children near adult strangers.</p> <p>Nor are children the only consideration. The Commons today elided paedophilia with sexual harassment. Again the consequence must surely be for the BBC, and any entertainment organisation, to deny lone females entry to men's dressing rooms unaccompanied, for fear of having \"permitted\" sexual harassment. This already applies to school and university tutorials, irrespective of the age of those involved.</p> <p>Soon doctors, lawyers and priests will have to practise, like the police, in pairs. Responsibility for our behaviour apparently no longer rests on us as individuals but on anyone whom a lawyer can claim was \"responsible\" for our contact with others. We are no longer our own masters. This is the royal road to Orwellian hell.</p> <p>The recent disproportionate treatment of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/phone-hacking\" title=\"\">phone hacking</a> is threatening the media, not with the already existing criminal law, but with statutory restrictions on its work in respect of personal (and perhaps corporate) privacy. These&#xa0;restrictions seem likely to&#xa0;be out of all proportion to the harm they seek to avert. The same may now apply after Savile.</p> <p>Those running big organisations, in the public and private sectors, face a lethal pincer movement. On the one side is a rising tide of risk aversion, seeping into every factory, office and profession, stifling enterprise, \"reassessing\" risk, clogging decision. On the other is a fear of what happens should this process fail. Just as the concept of an accident has slid from legal status, so has the \"honest mistake\". When Entwistle today admitted and regretted his mistake in not asking in more detail about the Savile programme, his tormenters hardly noticed. Honest mistakes do not exist, being replaced by only the most serious and probably criminal negligence, fit only for the pillory, the stocks or the gallows.</p> <p>We now have a new form of accountability, to an \"inquiriat\", a cackle of inquisitors and lawyers jumping to the bidding of public opinion, flapping round every executive's head and piling accusation on every error. This can only lead to ever more defensive behaviour in every sphere of public life. It is the paranoia of the modern state. Every document is \"open\", every conversation \"on the record\" and your friend today is tomorrow the witness against you.</p>",
  "<p>One could have been forgiven for assuming that, in the course of four and a half hours of combined presidential debates, all policy bases would have been covered.</p> <p>Big Bird, binders full of women and battleships all featured, after all. </p> <p>But a surprising number of major issues failed to warrant a mention in any of the three head-to-heads. Here's a guide to what was not discussed \u2013 and the candidates' stances on the forgotten topics.</p> <h2>Gay rights</h2> <p>Despite Obama making a high-profile U-turn on the issue of gay marriage just months ago, the topic of same-sex unions didn't get a look in. The closest Obama got to an attack was a snide jab at Romney getting his social policies from the \"1950s\".</p> <p><strong>Where they stand:</strong></p> <p><strong>Obama:</strong> Has pushed through a progressive agenda in terms of gay rights, having jettisoned the \"don't ask don't tell\" policy of previous administrations. His conversion to being pro same-sex marriage has been welcomed by the LGBT community, as has his direction to government bodies not to defend the Defence of Marriage Act (Doma) in the courts.</p> <p><strong>Romney:</strong> His agenda of gay rights has been built on shifting sands over the years. In the mid-1990s he told Log Cabin Republicans that he supported \"full equality for America's gay and lesbian citizens\". But he has veered towards social conservatism over the last year, repeatedly asserting his belief that \"marriage is between a man and a woman\". He has said he will defend Doma.</p> <h2>War on drugs</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398247924\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/3/1349292779789/marijuana-medical-angeles-006.jpg\" alt=\"marijuana medical angeles\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Los Angeles city council opted to reverse the ban rather than face an expensive and possibly doomed referendum fight.

Obama has also come out against legalisation. He did, however, bring in legislation to reduce the disparity between sentences given to those caught with crack cocaine, compared to users of powder cocaine. He has also diverted more funds to prevention and treatment programmes.</p> <p><strong>Romney: </strong>Likewise anti-legalisation, Romney blames demand in the US for the cross-border violence in Mexico. In a recent forum organised by the Univision TV Network, the Republican reportedly said that the US president has to make \"a priority of reducing demand in this country and communicating to our young people, and older people, that when they use these illegal drugs, they are contributing to the deaths of people around the world\".</p> <h2>Climate change</h2> <p>In the course of the presidential debates, the topics of gas prices and energy independence came up. But neither candidate turned the issue around to green energy <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2012/oct/23/us-president-debates-climate-change\">and the issue of climate change.</a></p> <p><strong>Where they stand:</strong></p> <p><strong>Obama:</strong> Has pledged to reduce emissions which cause global warming and hit out at sceptics, warning at the Democratic national convention: \"Climate change is not a hoax.\" Obama has also pumped money into the green sector through government grants and loans.</p> <p><strong>Romney: </strong>Has called for the phasing out of subsidies for the wind industry and has mocked Obama for wanting to help \"heal the planet\". Although not an outright denier, Romney has said that we \"do not know what's causing climate change on this planet\".</p> <h2>Domestic surveillance</h2> <p>Discussion on homeland security during the first debate failed to nail the candidates on creeping surveillance of US citizens.</p> <p><strong>Where they stand:</strong></p> <p><strong>Obama:</strong> According to the American Civil Liberties Union there has been a 60% increase in electronic surveillance under Obama's watch. He also extended the controversial patriot act, with authorises the wiretapping of US and non-US citizens.</p> <p><strong>Romney:</strong> Has said that he supports the patriot act. Meanwhile as governor of Massachusetts <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2005/09/15/wiretap_mosques_romney_suggests/\">he advocated the wiretapping of mosques</a> and carrying out surveillance on foreign students. </p> <h2>Housing</h2> <p>With the economy very much central in the election campaign, it is surprising that some of the main victims of the recession \u2013 homeowners left underwater by falling house prices and those foreclosed on \u2013 didn't get a look in.</p> <p><strong>Where they stand:</strong></p> <p><strong>Obama:</strong> Has introduced legislation that has helped millions of struggling homeowners, but not as many as he would have hoped. The home affordable modification programme has helped an estimated 1 million families refinance their home loans, but it's goal was to help up to 4 million. </p> <p><strong>Romney:</strong> Has criticised attempts to interfere with the housing market. Indeed his free-market approach appears to extend to giving no help to those facing repossession. \"Don't try to stop the foreclosure process. Let it run its course and hit the bottom,\" <a href=\"http://2012.talkingpointsmemo.com/2011/10/romney-dont-try-and-stop-the-foreclosure-process-video.php\">he said in reference to housing</a>. </p> <h2>Abortion</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398247925\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/29/1346274868810/abortion-colorado-personh-006.jpg\" alt=\"abortion colorado personhood\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pro-life activists march in Washington on the anniversary of Roe V Wade.

  "<p>\u2022\u2009Monday night's foreign policy debate offered little illumination on foreign policy \u2013 assuming you don't count the striking consensus between the candidates that America is, all things considered, totally awesome. But the post-debate commentary vividly demonstrated how differently American conservatives and liberals respond to a loss by their man.</p> <p>When Obama flubbed the first debate, the influential blogger Andrew Sullivan led the freakouts, declaring the election all but over and accusing the president of \"self-immolating\", while MSNBC host Chris Matthews screamed \"Where was Obama tonight?\" live on TV.</p> <p>Yet on Monday, when Obama's superior performance won accolades in the insta-polls, the right was ready. \"I think it's unequivocal, Romney won,\" said columnist Charles Krauthammer. \"Romney won the debate,\" added talk show host Michael Medved, \"by offering an image of even-tempered geniality, good-natured self-assurance, and unshakable commitment to cautious, reasonable, and peace-loving leadership.\" Many others agreed.</p> <p>\"Put simply,\" writes Kevin Drum of Mother Jones magazine, diagnosing a longstanding phenomenon in US politics, \"we liberals don't have enough \u2026 bloggers/pundits/columnists/talking heads who are willing to cheerfully say whatever it takes to advance the party line, no matter how ridiculous it is.\"</p> <p>One side-effect of this syndrome is especially troubling: it provokes feelings of warmth for conservative firebrand Glenn Beck, who's incapable of self-censorship. \"I am glad to know that Mitt agrees with Obama so much,\" Beck tweeted late on Monday. \"No, really. Why vote?\"</p> <p>\u2022\u2009Anyway, much more importantly, the flag pin Obama wore during the debate was smaller than Romney's, and that means he must be less patriotic, according to a detailed analysis by the National Review's Charles Kesler, which he appears to have produced without the aid of psilocybin mushrooms.</p> <p>\"Though he's tried to put Sixties-style anti-Americanism behind him \u2026 he hasn't quite succeeded,\" Kesler writes. Never let it be said that political discourse avoids the substantive issues.</p> <p>Although, for their part, left-wing critics weren't really justified in complaining about the absence of drones from Monday night's debate. Wolf Blitzer was there, hosting CNN's coverage, as always!</p> <p>\u2022\u2009Meanwhile, on the matter of \"horses and bayonets\": not everyone responded positively to Obama's efforts to provide a stimulus for the internet-meme industry on Monday night.</p> <p>An entire psuedo-controversy has arisen, based on the president's claim that bayonets were no longer used at all. Actually, NBC News's Chuck Todd informed his audience, bayonets are still \"actively used\" by the military, while Dan Riker, of the military surplus company Bayonet Inc \u2013 a man who may conceivably have grounds for being biased \u2013 was incensed.</p> <p>The comment was \"ignorant \u2026 because our soldiers still use bayonets,\" the website TMZ quoted him as saying. \"He should get educated on it.\" Right. Yes. Never mind that what the president actually said \u2013 in what was, in any case, a throwaway line \u2013 was that \"fewer\" bayonets were in use.</p> <p>In a campaign where most voters have made up their minds, facts don't get in the way of a promising micro-scandal. It's enough to make you want to stab yourself in the face with a sharp object of some kind.</p>",

That may sound as if it means: can the public imagine him bayoneting Syrian President Assad while riding a horse, or ordering a military strike against Iran. But in the last weeks of a campaign, it means something much more specific.</p> <p>Romney has had either 18 months or five years, depending how you're counting, to introduce his commander-in-chief bona fides to the full range of American voters. In the final weeks of a close race, his task was a different one: convincing undecided and middle-of-the road voters, who seem, this cycle, to be disproportionately women, that he is a likeable, moderate guy with solutions to the problems they face.</p> <p>As I have <a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/world-report/2012/10/22/dont-assume-women-dont-care-about-national-security\">written elsewhere</a>, polling continues to find that women are less receptive to violence and conflict-based solutions to problems than men. They \u2013 as well as moderates \u2013 disproportionately prefer Obama's approach to national security policy. This is <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/22/presidential-debate-reactions-2012-twitter-women-foreign-policy_n_2002996.html\">why</a> \"last night's\" Mitt Romney used the word \"peace\" so many times, and was so anxious to agree with President Obama's plans to remove US troops from Afghanistan, refuse to send US troops to Syria and intervene militarily in Iran only as a last resort.</p> <p>But for this to work, Romney had to do more than hug Obama on substance and find smart-sounding attack lines. He needed to come up with positive alternatives: what <em>is</em> the Middle East policy that will get rid of the murderous Assad, convince Israelis and Palestinians to come to terms and provoke the Arab streets to love us? What should the next administration do about the magical opportunity he invoked in Latin America? What tools are there he can deploy that Obama does not have to convince Iran to drop its nuclear program?</p> <p>Commentators \u2013 and not just Democrats \u2013 have been hitting Romney on his lack of substance, since the spring. Bill Kristol, Peggy Noonan, Colin Powell, Danielle Pletka have all at various times suggested that his vague positions lacked seriousness. \"Think, Mitt,\" Powell <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/05/colin-powell-to-romney-on-foreign-policy-come-on-mitt-think/257578/\">pleaded</a> after the \"Russia No 1 geopolitical foe\" comment.</p> <p>Romney had a run of misfortunes with his foreign policy outings: missteps on his Europe and Israel trip, <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/10/romney-speech-vmi-emails\">criticism</a> over politicization of the VMI speech venue, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/06/mitt-romney-afghanistan_n_1862533.html\">omission</a> of Afghanistan and veterans from his convention speech. So, to come off seriously and successfully as a moderate, he needed to shut down Obama's critique of him.</p> <p>And here he failed. Obama scored zinger after zinger: a decade wants its military policy back \u2013 a military of cavalry and bayonets, and on and on. Effective responses were few and far between, which meant Romney was allowing Obama to fire up his own base and sow doubts in Romney's target audience.</p> <p>The insta-polls last night, whatever they may say about the race itself, reflected Romney's failure to move from a candidate with a critique to a leader with bullet-proof, or at least quip-proof, policy alternatives.</p> <p>The polls showed it; the dial-tests showed it; the pundit analyses showed it. Romney made a full run at Obama's dominance on national security, and didn't shake it. It remains to be seen how profound this impact is on the race, but the conventional wisdom about the politics of American national security, marked for three decades by progressives' fear of conservative dominance and mockery, will never be the same.</p> <p><em>Heather Hurlburt is executive director of the National Security Network</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jamesantle\">James Antle</a>: 'Romney tried to distance himself from George Bush'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398245558\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/06/02/james_antle_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"James Antle\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Both candidates were broadly in favor of a US foreign policy that includes or permits preventive war, drone attacks, untrammeled executive surveillance powers and \"crippling sanctions\" against Iran.</p> <p>Both insisted no option was off the table in dealing with Iran, a threat they both described in the same terms. Both supported regime change in Libya by US arms and in Egypt \u2013 though in the latter case, they would leave it up to the Egyptians themselves.</p> <p>Neither was specific about what kind of \"help\" they had in mind for Syrian rebels. Neither was willing to admit their policies might lead to direct American military involvement in the places where they were intervening.</p> <p>The only time the exchange between President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney genuinely resembled a debate was when it veered off-topic, tackling subjects ranging from tax cuts to school classroom sizes.</p> <p>Romney uttered cliches about his opponent apologizing for America, while Obama pretended that his successful raid against Osama bin Laden was representative of his track record against al-Qaida more generally.</p> <p>The most interesting aspect of the debate was Romney trying to distance himself from George W Bush, explicitly saying the country didn't need another Iraq or Afghanistan war.</p> <p>The second most interesting was the level of mockery and sarcasm employed by Obama \u2013 he once reminded Romney that the military budget wasn't a game of battleship \u2013 which was unusual for an incumbent president. Perhaps Obama's most effective line, though, was when <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2012/10/third_presidential_debate_the_foreign_policy_argument_between_barack_obama.html\">he said Romney would</a> \"do the same things we did, but you'd say them louder and somehow that will make a difference.\"</p> <p>It stung because it seemed true.</p> <p>Romney tried to be agreeable and avoid looking like a warmonger. Obama was aggressive and looked somewhat like he thought he was running from behind.</p> <p>Obama edged out Romney in the second and third debates, but Romney scored a decisive victory in the first. In the end, it appears that Romney has been the net beneficiary, turning this into a competitive race once again. <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57536261/polls-gallup-still-has-romney-up-marist-shows-obama-leads-in-two-swing-states/\">Gallup has the former Massachusetts governor ahead</a>, most swing state polls still suggest the president is the frontrunner. </p> <p>But there's no debating, it's close.</p> <p><em>James Antle is editor of the Daily Caller News Foundation and a senior editor at the American Spectator</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/alex-slater\">Alex Slater</a>: 'If anyone took the Bush mantle, it was Obama'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398245559\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Global/content/icons/2010/9/20/1284991083547/alexslater_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Alex Slater\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>America was deprived of a \"rock 'em, sock 'em\" third presidential debate this election season. Instead, what undecided voters in swing states got last night was a meandering, sometimes slightly argumentative, but largely somniferous discussion between two candidates more interested in mild personal attacks than in substantive foreign policy.</p> <p>Yes, Obama won the debate: <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/POLITICS/pollingcenter/polls/3287\">48% of a scientifically conducted poll with CNN </a>voters confirmed the president's victory, but only by a relatively small margin. Indeed, 40% believed Governor Romney to be the victor. In an ever-tightening race, this should give Democrats pause.</p> <p>Romney's performance was nuanced to a fault. Clearly, his staff had tattooed the words \"do no harm\" on his arm before he stepped on stage. And clearly, the governor paid attention. Conscious of <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2012/10/15/swing-states-poll-women-voters-romney-obama/1634791/\">the tightening polls among female voters</a>, Romney had obviously been briefed to be non-aggressive, to avoid the mantle of warmonger \u2013 in short, to avoid becoming the third rail of American politics: the bumbling, warmongering President George W Bush.</p> <p>But that also exposed him to appear weak, a \"yes man\" to Obama's four-year record in office. Indeed, as Mara Liasson, journalist for NPR, pointed out only minutes after the debate, Romney's most uttered words seemed to be \"I agree\".</p> <p>The president, on the other hand, apart from inexplicably having been told to stare at the governor in what can only be described as a creepy glare, was in a feistier mood. For months now, his campaign has steadily avoided the \"go-to\" political tactic in the American political narrative: painting your opponent as a flip-flopper, undecided and vacillating on issues.</p> <p>That restraint was gone last night, as the president repeatedly delivered attack after attack on Romney's inconsistent record, from troops in Iraq to the surge in Afghanistan. In fact, if anyone took the Bush mantle, it was Obama repeating almost word for word parts of President Bush's second convention speech:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I will never shy away from defending America.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>So, where does this leave the campaign in these closing weeks? Yes, Obama won tonight, but these debates have been lackluster at best. On the whole, the three match-ups can likely be called an overall draw, with the first debate propelling what the press is now calling \"Mittmentum\". Nevertheless, the political calculus remains firmly in the president's favor, with Ohio \u2013 this election's pivotal state \u2013 looking likely to swing Obama's way.</p> <p>If that happens, political scientists across the country will be forced to return to the age-old \u2013 and still unresolved \u2013 question, \"Do debates really matter?\" And last night, here in Boca, that seemed doubtful at best.</p> <p><em>Alex Slater is a Democratic strategist and principal of the political consultancy Clyde Strategies</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/markweisbrot\">Mark Weisbrot</a>: 'It was a victory just to have drones mentioned'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398245560\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2010/10/28/1288281260427/weisbrot.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Weisbrot\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Weisbrot</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: guardian.co.uk</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The presidential debate on foreign policy is always a painful and disgusting spectacle for any reality-based viewer.</p> <p>Both candidates play into the fantasy that the United States needs to spend more on its military than most of the world combined, because we face grave threats when the rest of the world knows that US foreign and military policy is all about power and empire.

Most importantly, Romney is more likely to go to war with Iran; this despite the fact that Obama shifted his position (during the debate) to Romney's position that Iran will have to give up its \"nuclear program\" (Obama started out saying \"nuclear weapons\" would not be tolerated). Romney's assertion that he wants to make \"pariahs\" of Iranian diplomats reflects a substantive difference \u2013 that he is less likely to seek a negotiated solution and more likely to start another disastrous war. Romney was also forced to acknowledge that he would pay for an additional $2tn in military spending with cuts to domestic spending, something most Americans don't want.</p> <p>Anti-war organizations <a href=\"http://salsa.democracyinaction.org/o/1439/p/dia/action/public/?action_KEY=11788\">petitioned</a> moderator Bob Schieffer to ask a question about drones, and he did. Drones have <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-naiman/americans-press-us-ambass_b_1941919.html\">killed</a> hundreds of civilians in Pakistan, building a groundswell of hatred against America. The existence of the program is officially classified, and the Obama administration does not publicly acknowledge it, so it was something of a victory just to have it mentioned.</p> <p>On the technical side, Obama was combative and did very well, as he did in the second debate. If he loses this election \u2013 which is not likely, but still possible \u2013 it will be due to his failure to confront Romney on an issue that is most important to senior citizens, the only age group where he is losing.</p> <p>That issue is social security. <a href=\"http://www.mittromney.com/issues/social-security\">Both Romney and his party</a> are on the record in favor of cuts to social security, but Obama from the first debate has <a href=\"http://truth-out.org/opinion/item/11991-social-security-president-obamas-biggest-failure-in-last-weeks-debate\">pretended</a> that there is no difference on this issue.

How refreshing.</p> <p>On the campaign trail, Romney has evoked the bluster and relentless chest-thumping of President Bush. But last night, Romney conveyed an attitude of humility that many war-weary Americans are desperate to hear. In his early opening salvo, he congratulated President Obama for \"taking out Osama bin Laden,\" and added: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"But we can't kill our way out of this mess.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Indeed, while going after al-Qaida is the right policy, meeting that challenge only militarily won't resolve the underlying political circumstances that give rise to terrorism.</p> <p>In another extraordinary turn, Romney said on the subject of getting the Muslim world to reject extremism that \"[w]e don't want another Iraq, we don't want another Afghanistan\". Perhaps Romney's realist handlers \u2013 those who want him to win the presidency \u2013 have finally gotten to him: <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/9ryfw2v\">polls show overwhelmingly that Americans think the Iraq war was a mistake</a>, and America paid an enormous price in blood and treasure for an Iraq under considerable Iranian influence. Even <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/8kubbv6\">many in the GOP</a> have turned against America's endless wars of nation-building in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p> <p>The governor was vague and evasive at times, perhaps to obscure the fact that his substantive differences with Obama were minimal and mainly semantic. For instance, on Syria, Romney's policy is no different than the incumbent's. He advocates helping the opposition by working with America's partners; finding responsible parties and rebels and arming them; working for the creation of a responsible government to replace Bashir al-Assad; and not getting drawn into a military conflict by injecting neither American troops nor a no-fly zone.</p> <p>On military spending, Romney came across as disjointed and contradictory. After all, if a President Romney intends to spend 4% of America's GDP on the military \u2013 an increase of $2tn over the next ten years \u2013 then how will his administration pay for that and close the budget deficit?</p> <p>Part of the problem is that Romney's vision appears to be driven by capabilities and tactics (incremental policies to achieve short-term objectives) rather than a clearly articulated strategy (a broad sense of guidance for our actions and decisions). Worse, both Romney and Obama embrace some of the same hawkish and meddlesome national security and surveillance policies adopted under President Bush. In that respect, President Obama's predecessor \u2013 and the pro-interventionist foreign policy establishment in Washington \u2013 was the debate's clear winner.</p> <p>For all of these flaws, though, Governor Romney's shift was still remarkable. Juxtaposed with his previous invocations of the American people watching the world and \"shaping events\", or having \"confidence in our cause\" and \"resolve in our might\", he appears to have realized Americans are tired after enduring the human and financial costs of two prolonged and deeply unpopular wars. At last, the Romney campaign has adopted a tone of moderation in the final weeks before the election.</p> <p><em>Malou Innocent is a foreign policy analyst at the Cato Institute</em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/jim-geraghty\">Jim Geraghty</a>: 'Some will find the president's diatribe unattractively sarcastic'</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398245562\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Global/content/icons/2012/1/11/1326298456752/jimgeraghty_140x140.jpg\" alt=\"Jim Geraghty\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>In a perfect world, candidates would come to a foreign policy debate with great knowledge, recognition of the complications and difficulties in making the world a better place, and a humility about their ability to foresee events in a rapidly-changing world. Both candidates would recall that President George W Bush campaigned on a pledge for a humble foreign policy in 2000, and President Obama would recognize that promises such as closing Guant\u00e1namo Bay turned out to be much harder to keep than he expected. </p> <p>Around the globe, promises are easier to make than keep. Every presidential challenger paints the incumbent as soft on China; once in office, the economic intertwining of the US and China, and Washington's quite limited ability to influence the decision-making in Beijing, become clearer. For <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/campaign-spot/316070/bill-clinton-still-talking\">four straight cycles</a>, Bill Clinton and George W Bush pledged to move the US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem; for 16 years, those promises were perpetually delayed. (Of course, this year the issue briefly returned again, as Democrats had a floor fight over a declaration that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel.)</p> <p>Unfortunately, last night's debate occurred in a far from perfect world. Voters aren't thinking about foreign policy right now, and both candidates knew it. There aren't that many undecided voters left, and those that are may not have been watching. The debate was up against Monday Night Football and the seventh game of the baseball playoffs, suggesting viewership would be lower than the preceding two presidential debates.</p> <p>To the extent undecided voters think about foreign policy at all, they're quasi-isolationist and poorly informed. The last thing they want to hear is that the world is complicated, or that the US can't tell other countries to go pound sand.</p> <p>Finally, while Bob Schieffer seemed to hit the right balance of tough questions without frequent interruptions, the topics were heavily focused on the Middle East. In 90 minutes of debate, there was no discussion of the European Union, its currency and debt crises, and what that could mean for the US economy. No mention of violence on our southern border with Mexico; no mention of India.</p> <p>Mitt Romney and Barack Obama went into Monday night with dramatically different strategies. The president seemed to think he needed a knockout blow and his base undoubtedly believes he landed one after another, while some will find the president's \"horses and bayonets\" and Battleship diatribe remarkably condescending and unattractively sarcastic (the Democratic base undoubtedly believes Mitt Romney is a joke and deserves to be treated as such). The independents and folks who climbed onto the Romney bandwagon since the first debate are unlikely to be persuaded by this sneer, however.</p> <p>Romney, on the other hand, aimed to look presidential. The result was a remarkably uncombative debate performance. It seems he believed Obama's last big card to play was that Romney would be a duplicate of George W Bush on issues of war and peace, and so he disarmed it by declaring early on, \"we can't kill our way out of this mess.\"</p> <p>The word \"peace\" was used 12 times last night; it was spoken by Romney every time. It was a sales pitch to a war-weary nation \u2013 likely to be effective, even if the next four years are rather unlikely to see any genuine, lasting peace.</p> <p><em>Jim Geraghty is a contributing editor to the National Review and writes the Campaign Spot blog</em></p>",
  "<p>With two weeks of the 2012 US presidential election to run the race between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney looks to be a<a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/polls/\"> dead heat on national polls</a>. But with the incumbent Obama still leading in key <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/10/22/ohio-poll-of-polls-shows-tight-race/\">swing states such as Ohio</a> most pundits still consider him to be the favourite.</p> <p>Joining <strong>Tom Clark</strong> to discuss the campaign, the polls, the economy and the candidates we have pollster <strong>Stan Greenberg</strong>, plus Guardian columnists <strong>Richard Adams</strong>, <strong>Jonathan Freedland </strong>and <strong>Hadley Freeman</strong>. </p> <p>We also hear from Aditya Chakrabortty on the economic conditions in the US; from Stan Greenberg on the latest polls and from <strong>Geoffrey Kabaservice </strong>on what a win for Mitt Romney would mean for the future of the Republican party.</p> <p>Leave your thoughts and predictions below.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama attempted to seize back the political initiative on Tuesday by abruptly switching to a new, positive strategy for the final stretch of the White House campaign after dominating the third and final presidential debate.</p> <p>After months of criticism for campaigning negatively \u2013 with a relentless and costly stream of ads since early summer aimed at undermining Mitt Romney's character \u2013 the Obama campaign is to emphasise what the president would do with another four years in office.</p> <p>Democrats and undecided voters have been pleading with him for months to set out in detail his second-term agenda \u2013 something on which he has been extremely vague so far.</p> <p>The campaign is printing 3.5m copies of a 20-page leaflet to be distributed in the battlefield states setting out his proposed agenda for economic recovery, domestic-based energy, education, tax, healthcare and pensions. Obama was backing it up with a minute-long advert in nine battlefield states from Wednesday.</p> <p>Although it is an important strategic switch, there is little new in the leaflet, more a repackaging of vague plans set out by Obama over the last few months. In spite of the shift towards a more positive strategy, the Obama campaign will not completely abandon its attacks on Romney's character.</p> <p>With the debates behind them, Obama and Romney hit the campaign trail Tuesday, beginning a series of gruelling tours of the battlefield states. Obama spoke at a rally in Florida before heading to Ohio, while Romney held events in Nevada and Colorado.</p> <p>The consensus in the US media was that Obama had dominated the 90-minute debate on foreign policy in Boca Raton, Florida, but had not done enough to change the course of the election. Although Obama had won last night and last week, these do not compensate for the debate that really mattered, the first one in Denver that allowed Romney back into the race.</p> <p>A CBS instant poll after the Boca Raton debate awarded it to Obama, putting him on 53% to Romney's 23%.</p> <p>Obama's main adviser, David Axelrod, in a conference call with reporters, described the debate as \"a great springboard for the last two weeks\".</p> <p>Contrary to rumours that the campaign is abandoning North Carolina and Florida as already lost, Axelrod insisted this is untrue and it was not pulling out of these states.</p> <p>\"We'll know who's bluffing and who isn't in two weeks,\" Axelrod said.</p> <p>As the two campaigns set out on the final two-week slog, the Romney team seemed to be the jauntier of the two, hoping that the momentum that began in Denver will carry them through to November 6.</p> <p>Stuart Stevens, one of Romney's main advisers, said: \"We came in [to the Monday debate] in a strong position and left in an even stronger one.\" He identified Ohio as a pivotal battlefield state. \"He will be in Ohio a lot,\" Stevens said.</p> <p>The Romney campaign is staying negative, issuing an ad picking up on a line from the debate in which Romney accused Obama of having gone early in his presidency on an 'apology tour' of the Middle East.</p> <p>One of the Republican Super Pacs, Restore Our Future, began a $17.7m ad blitz for Romney.</p> <p>In the debate, Obama repeatedly portrayed Romney as \"all over the map\" on foreign policy. He described his opponent twice as \"wrong and reckless\".</p> <p>The president worked through a list of issues on which he said Romney had been wrong, from support for the 2003 Iraq invasion through to opposing setting a timetable for withdrawal from Afghanistan.</p> <p>On issue after issue, from Iranian sanctions to withdrawal from Afghanistan, there was little difference between Romney's position and that of the administration, but Romney insisted he would have projected American strength more effectively. Continuing his shift into a more moderate, centrist position, he insisted to war-weary Americans that, in spite of past bellicose statements, he was not looking to engage in another war.</p> <p>One of the most telling moments came when Obama lectured Romney on military developments as if he was a child. Responding to a pledge by Romney to increase military spending and a complaint that the navy had fewer ships, Obama resorted to heavy sarcasm.</p> <p>\"You mentioned the navy, for example, and that we have fewer ships than we did in 1917. Well, Governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military's changed. We have these things called aircraft carriers, where planes land on them. We have these ships that go underwater \u2013 nuclear submarines,\" Obama said.</p> <p>But Romney did not crumple, and recovered in the second half of the debate, in particular when he managed to drag the subject on to domestic economic concerns.</p> <p>On the Middle East, Romney said an attack on Iran would be a last resort and that he was against direct US military involvement in Syria. He sought to neutralise the advantage Obama enjoys thanks to the killing of Osama bin Laden by insisting that his own policy was about more than \"going after the bad guys\".</p> <p>\"We can't just kill our way out of this mess,\" Romney said.</p>",

Our colleague Mona Mahmood has been talking to a Sunni resident of Mezzeh district who gave her name as Yasmin Hamdi.</p> <p>Two of her brothers were kidnapped by rebel fighters, she said. One was brutally killed and the family sold their house to pay a ransom for the other.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I cannot say that things in Damascus are rosy. There are problems for sure and things are not like before but the situation now is much better. I feel so glad and comfortable when I see the Syrian army around. This is the feeling of most of the people, including the opposition.</p> <p>I walk from where I live in Mezzeh district to my work in Kfar Sousa. It is about 5km \u2013 I do it for exercise. We used to stay out till three in the morning but now we cannot do that for security reasons.</p> <p>My brother, who was 21 and a student at the political studies college, was kidnapped at one of the checkpoints set up [by rebel fighters] near his college a few months ago.</p> <p>We were not sure who they [the kidnappers] were and kept asking about him everywhere. Then the kidnappers contacted us asking for a ransom, but we were late in paying as we were shocked and suspicious. After a while, the kidnappers contacted us and said: \"You can get your man at the graveyard.\"</p> <p>My father and other members of the family went to the graveyard. They found my brother's body in many pieces. He was tortured badly. We asked the help of the security forces and they told us later that the militants who kidnapped my brother were Ahfad al-Rasoul brigade. It is a Salafi brigade and they killed him because they regard any student in the political studies college as pro-regime.</p> <p>We were just trying to adjust ourselves to the reality that we had lost a member of our family when my other brother, who works at the Political Security, was also kidnapped and we had to pay five million Syrian pounds [$71,500] to get him back. My father had to sell the house to get the money.</p> <p>My brother said that he was kept blindfolded for more than 10 hours for interrogation and he could hear the accent of men who could hardly speak Arabic. They were asking him to memorise the Holy Qur'an. They used to put a knife under his chin as they were interrogating him.</p> <p>We cannot deny that there are wrong practices by some members of the army but you cannot say that they arrest women and children and kill them.</p> <p>I know a friend who lives in Darayya. He said all the people you saw in the videos who were killed in Darayya were not killed by the Syrian army but by the FSA. When the FSA recognised that they were losing, they gathered the people there, shot them and filmed them afterwards to say that there was a massacre.</p> <p>Yes, when the planes fire shells they do not differentiate whether the target is FSA or civilian and can kill civilians. But the Syrian army do not kill people at random as the FSA claim.</p> <p>I live in a place where you can find different sects of Syrian people, but we never feel that there is a sectarian division between us as the opposition is trying to show to the outside world.</p> <p>Now, it has become a crime if you work for the government, but how can you live? This is the only secure source of money for the people. Before, we used to have tourism and agriculture, now nothing. So it is good that the government is still paying us.</p> <p>There is a big exaggeration about what is happening in Syria and I believe the Syrian people will overcome this crisis and will be able to have shisha again in Jebel Qassioun.</p> <p>Most of the schools are open in Damascus except a few at the outskirts but families are afraid to send their kids to school for fear of kidnapping. Today the universities started here \u2013 come and see the heavy traffic near the College of Law, it's unbelievable. Also Damascus is busy now as people are shopping for Eid.</p> <p>I know districts where people started to kick out FSA men and accuse them of all the problems. They do not have any place in Damascus any more.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-23T16:39:28.998Z\">at 5.39pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5086b53258f96784ee2909f2\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-23T15:19:41.274Z\">4.19pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Smoke coming from military HQ</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Residents of Muadamiyeh confirm that something has happened in the headquarters of the Syrian regime's 4th Brigade, but they are unsure what it was.</p> <p>Our colleague Mona Mahmood has spoken to Suha Salih, an activist in the area.

I tried to relay the voices of activists on the ground and he immediately dismissed me, and in fact lost his temper with me. He did not want to hear bad news from activists on the ground. I felt that as an allegedly neutral party, and one who should be a negotiator, he had an obligation to listen to what the people on the streets are saying, and he flatly refused.</p> </blockquote> <p>Asked if she ruled out future negotiations with Brahimi, she said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Of course we should always pursue discussions and dialogue, but it has to lead to concrete results. We can\u2019t come out with soft plans that do not address the fact that there is something approaching genocide taking place in Syria. We cannot discuss in diplomatic or political terms any sort of a solution that does not include the removal of Bashar al-Assad and his regime apparatus.</p> </blockquote> <p>She roundly rejected Brahimi\u2019s idea of a truce over the Eid al-Adha holiday.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Brahimi ceasefire proposal is really dead on arrival. To us it is nothing more than version three of the Annan plan. It is a sign that the United Nations wants to beat its head against the wall again and again and expect a different outcome. Assad has demonstrated through the Kofi Annan plan, and before that the Arab League initiative, that he has no intention of pulling back tanks, or allowing unfettered access to media, or allowing peaceful protests to continue.</p> <p>A call for a ceasefire now that has no teeth, no consequences, and no real timetable is just a waste of time. Brahimi has requested a ceasefire during the Eid holidays. That implies that it is OK to kill up until the holidays begin, and it implies that post holidays there is no restriction on killing.</p> </blockquote> <p>Jouejati said last night\u2019s US presidential debate suggested there was unlikely to be any increase in US support for rebel groups in Syria after the election.</p> <p>\u201cIf Romney were to be elected I would not expect air strikes against Syria. I believe it\u2019s just campaign rhetoric,\" she said.</p> <p>Asked about human rights abuses by rebel fighters,&#xa0;Jouejati said 40 rebel units had now signed up to human rights charter. But she added:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>After four decades of Assad rule, there is no such thing as human rights in Syria. The defected soldiers who belong to the Free Syrian Army have the same level of education as the regular regime soldiers. So it\u2019s a process of educating, dialogue and showing them that there is a way to win this and be better than the Assad regime ...</p> <p>If members of the Free Syrian Army are committing atrocities, of course they need to be held accountable. They need to be educated in terms of human rights. We are looking to transition into a state that respects human rights and international laws. So it begins with us.</p> </blockquote> <p>She said the opposition Syrian National Council, of which the LCC is a member, was preparing to announce \u201cindications\u201d of a possible transitional government over the next few days.</p> <p>The LCC has withdrawn its threat to pull out of the SNC over frustrations with the organisation under former leader Burhan Ghalioun.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We want to contribute to all efforts to bring about democracy to Syria, so we recognise that the SNC is a major political player in the Syrian agenda. We were a bit distressed with some of the dysfunction of the SNC. So we are looking forward to a restructuring and perhaps the rendering of a more functional organisation that can lead the way to a transition in a post-Assad Syria.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"\" >  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;ab-player&quot; data-boourl=&quot;http://audioboo.fm/boos/1021494-brahimi-lost-temper-with-lcc-when-it-rejected-assad-talks-and-syria-ceasefire-says-rafifj/embed&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://audioboo.fm/boos/1021494-brahimi-lost-temper-with-lcc-when-it-rejected-assad-talks-and-syria-ceasefire-says-rafifj&quot;&gt;listen to &amp;#x2018;Brahimi &amp;#x27;lost temper&amp;#x27; with LCC when it rejected Assad talks and #Syria ceasefire says @RafifJ&amp;#x2019; on Audioboo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;(function() { var po = document.createElement(&quot;script&quot;); po.type = &quot;text/javascript&quot;; po.async = true; po.src = &quot;http://d15mj6e6qmt1na.cloudfront.net/assets/embed.js&quot;; var s = document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;)[0]; s.parentNode.insertBefore(po, s); })();&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-23T15:35:42.852Z\">at 4.35pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5086a3e5c0e343ef1abc7f53\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-23T14:04:21.371Z\">3.04pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">'100 arrested by Lebanese army'</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Lebanese army has arrested more than 100 people in connection with recent clashes in Beirut and Tripoli, <a href=\"http://www.nowlebanon.com/NewsArticleDetails.aspx?ID=450130\">Now Lebanon</a> reports citing a statement issued by the military today.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The army said that among the detained were 34 Syrian nationals and four Palestinian nationals, adding that 13 soldiers and two officers were injured during the raids to arrest the suspects.</p> <p>Also in the Beqaa, the army arrested five men for possessing and trafficking arms.</p> <p>The army added that it would continue conducting raids in both Beirut and Tripoli until calm was restored.</p> </blockquote> </div>   </div> <div id=\"block-50869ea7c0e343ef1abc7f52\" class=\"block is-summary\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-23T13:41:59.685Z\">2.41pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">'Twenty dead' as Aleppo bakery is hit</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>At least 20 people \u2013 including women and children \u2013 died today when shells fired by government forces hit a bakery in the Hananu district of Aleppo, Reuters <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/23/us-syria-crisis-bakery-idUSBRE89M0QD20121023\">reports</a> citing opposition activists.</p> <p>Majd Nour, an opposition campaigner in Aleppo, told Reuters&#xa0;Free Syrian Army fighters were guarding the bakery at the time:</p> <p>\"It was quiet all day and suddenly Assad's forces fired three shells.

The town of Amouda supported the revolution from the beginning.</p> <p>The concern now is that the Assad regime is using the PKK [the Kurdish Workers Party] to put pressure on Turkey. The regime has given the PKK the right to control the town and arm themselves. It has become an official ally of the regime.</p> <p>The Kurds are divided. Kurdish political parties want federalism and independence, while young Kurds here want a unified Syria.</p> <p>There is a high level of co-ordination between the regime and PKK. The military security compound used to be in the centre of the town, but it was moved to the outskirts and is now under the control of PKK.</p> <p>The PKK set up a so-called House of the People, and separate courts and security forces, as if the town were liberated. All the schools here have been teaching Arabic for 80 years. But this year, the PKK insisted on adding Kurdish lessons to the curriculum.</p> <p>Only a tiny minority of people support what the PKK is doing.</p> <p>The PKK are trying to impose their control on other neighbouring towns like in Malkiyia which is close to the Iraqi border. A charity society in the town was raided by PKK forces and sealed off under the pretext that it was receiving money from Turkey and Islamists.</p> <p>The PKK are also suspected of being involved in the assassinations of Kurdish activists and intellectuals who challenge them. For example, a month ago, Ra'as Bashou, an activist from Hassaka, fell out with PKK.

The <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/factchecking-the-first-presidential-debate-of-2012/2012/10/04/9d47934e-0d66-11e2-bb5e-492c0d30bff6_blog.html\">Washington Post says of the plans</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Romney also has said he will make his plan \"revenue neutral\" by eliminating tax loopholes and deductions, although he has not provided the details. The Tax Policy Center has analyzed the specifics of Romney's plan thus far released and concluded that the numbers aren't there to make it revenue neutral.</p> </blockquote> <p></p> <h2><a name=\"auto\">The auto industry</a></h2> <p>Although the bailouts of the auto industry are over, the issue is still a live one in the debates. Obama said of Romney in the second debate:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When Governor Romney said we should let Detroit go bankrupt, I said we're going to bet on American workers</p> </blockquote> <p>To which Romney replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>He said that I said we should take Detroit bankrupt. And that's right. My plan was to have the company go through bankruptcy like 7-Eleven did and Macy's and Continental Airlines and come out stronger. And I know he keeps saying, you want to take Detroit bankrupt. Well, the president took Detroit bankrupt. You took General Motors bankrupt. You took Chrysler bankrupt. So when you say that I wanted to take the auto industry bankrupt, you actually did</p> </blockquote> <p>In 2012, the auto industry is looking healthier, with growth even on last year, according to this data from the <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/iag/tgs/iagauto.htm\">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>. It shows employment up slightly on 2011, 53,400 on the year before. </p> <p>However, hourly earnings for those in auto manufacturing haven't kept pace with inflation, down from $21.97 last year to $21.15 now.</p> <p>If you look at the employment data by region it shows slight improvements on last year. But still not a complete revival.</p> <h2><a name=\"health\">Health care</a></h2> <p>US health care and 'Obama care' came up repeatedly too.</p> <p>Said Obama in the second debate</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>And over the last two years, health care premiums have gone up \u2014 it's true \u2014 but they've gone up slower than any time in the last 50 years </p> </blockquote> <p>So, how does the US compare? Although it doesn't have a national health service like the UK, it still has the highest health spending in the world. The US has the highest health spending in the world - equivalent to 17.9% of its gross domestic product (GDP), or $8,362 per person. And it's not all private - government spending is at $4,437 per person, only behind Luxembourg, Monaco and Norway.<br>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2012/jun/30/healthcare-spending-world-country\">Read more</a></p> <h2><a name=\"cop\">World cop</a></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398238793\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/23/1351008304433/US-military-deployments-o-008.jpg\" alt=\"US military deployments overseas, interactive\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US military deployments overseas, interactive.

  "<p>President Barack Obama's claims that massive military spending cuts due to kick in next year \"will not happen\" caught foes and supporters by surprise during Monday's final presidential debate.</p> <p>Responding to criticism from Mitt Romney that the automatic cuts, known as sequesters and set to start in January, would make America's future \"less certain and less secure\", Obama said: \"First of all, the sequester is not something I proposed, it's something that Congress proposed. It will not happen. The budget that we're talking about is not reducing our military spending. It's maintaining it.\"</p> <p>Republicans and Democrats are heading toward a year-end clash over the US's massive deficit and the expiration of Bush-era tax cuts. The two sides agreed to $1tn in defence and non-defence spending cuts if a compromise cannot be reached.</p> <p>Both sides oppose the cuts, with Republicans keen to protect military spending and Democrats keen to protect social programmes. But Obama's statement seems to have taken military spending cuts, his biggest bargaining chip, off the table.</p> <p>After the debate, Obama's team moved to weaken the president's statement. White House senior adviser David Plouffe toned told reporters that \"everyone in Washington agrees that sequester 'should not happen.'\" Obama's senior campaign adviser David Axelrod told CNN that \"plenty of people on both sides\" want to a balanced deal.</p> <p>Defence firms including Lockheed and Boeing have already begun laying off workers ahead of expected cuts. Trade lobby group the National Association of Manufacturers to the Aerospace Industries Association has warned 1m jobs could be lost, although dire predictions of imminent layoffs have been questioned by Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments.</p> <p>To date, Obama's strategy has been to hold up the cuts as a threat as he tries to get Republicans to agree to tax hikes. But Tad DeHaven, a budget analyst at the Cato Institute, said he was not surprised that Obama was backing away from cuts as the election nears.</p> <p>\"The tighter this race has gotten, the more both these guys have run away from cuts. This was a bipartisan agreement, but ever since these cuts became a possibility, Republicans and Democrats have been backing away from them.\"</p> <p>DeHaven said that in the long term, taking the cuts off the table would not hamper Obama's negotiations, assuming he is re-elected. \"If Obama is re-elected, he can come back and say there will be no defence cuts, but he has the mandate to increase taxes on higher earners,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Following the most recent presidential and vice presidential debates, global communications network <a href=\"http://www.havasmedia.com/\" title=\"\">Havas Media</a> have released further data on the US Presidential candidates' 'meaningfulness' scores.</p> <p>You can see the first set of results from this series <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media-network/media-network-blog/2012/oct/15/obama-romney-brand-analysis\" title=\"\">here</a>.</p> <p>The scores track how voters feel the candidates will help them as they strive to live more meaningful and more fulfilled lives. 'Meaningfulness' is defined by measuring 39 softer factors that measure whether the candidates are seen to be not just be making political promises \u2013 but to be actively, tangibly making a difference to people, the community, the planet and society. The analysis also tracks how voters are using different media platforms and how voters are using different media platforms. Here are some of the key findings.</p> <p><strong>Most voters do not think that either candidate will offer them a better quality of life</strong></p> <p>Scores are on the rise for Obama, although they are still low \u2013 only a third of voters think that either will have a positive impact on their personal wellbeing and the wellbeing of the communities they care about. Romney saw gains in factors associated with money and security.</p> <p><strong>Paul Ryan's impact during the vice presidential debate also had a positive effect on Romney's meaningfulness scores</strong></p> <p>Although his scores are still significantly lower than Obama's, Romney did see an increase following the VP and second presidential debates, specifically in the areas feeling safe and less vulnerable.</p> <p><strong>Text and face to face discussion increased significantly during the debates, while chatter on Facebook and Twitter decreased</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Viewing figures increased as the number of voters watching via online video, tablet, mobile phone, desktop or laptop computer increased</p> <p>\u2022 Still only 20% of voters follow or actively write on Facebook about the debate/election</p> <p>\u2022 40% of voters preferred to speak to friends and family in person (compared to 28% three weeks ago)</p> <p>\u2022 Voters are twice as likely to get information about Obama via micro blogs (eg Twitter) than about Romney</p> <p><strong>Fast facts on this week's meaningful scores:</strong></p> <p>1. Following the second presidential debate, Romney is perceived as the stronger candidate in terms of listening to and caring about citizens</p> <p>2. While Obama still leads in perception of support of charities and good causes, Romney is quickly gaining on him</p> <p>3. Obama saw a significant increase in inspiring voters to make the world a better place, in comparison to a modest increase by Romney</p> <p>4. Obama's scores for fostering community development increased, while Romney's increased only marginally</p> <p>5. On the question of who is a 'true leader', while Obama's scores are still significantly higher than Romney's, scores for Romney increased as Obama's scores decreased</p> <p>6. Both candidates' scores increased when voters were asked about their commitment to solving environmental issues \u2013 Obama scored significantly higher overall, however</p> <p>7. In general, Romney continues to lag behind Obama, underscoring his challenge to connect with voters in a meaningful way.</p> <p><em>This post was originally posted on the </em><a href=\"http://www.havasmedia.com/2012/10/as-both-candidates-struggle-to-offer-more-meaning-and-voters-turn-to-more-traditional-communications-can-social-media-and-celebrity-endorsement-widen-the-gap-for-obama/\" title=\"\"><em>Havas Media website</em></a></p> <p><strong>To get more articles like this sent direct to your inbox, </strong><a href=\"https://register.guardian.co.uk/media/\" title=\"\"><strong>sign up for free membership</strong></a><strong> of the </strong><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media-network\" title=\"\"><strong>Guardian Media Network</strong></a><strong>.

  "<p>The pickup halted in Kidal, the far-flung Malian desert town that is home to members of the Grammy award-winning band Tinariwen. Seven AK47-toting militiamen got out and marched to the family home of a local musician. He wasn't home, but the message delivered to his sister was chilling: \"If you speak to him, tell him that if he ever shows his face in this town again, we'll cut off all the fingers he uses to play his guitar with.\"</p> <p>The gang then removed guitars, amplifiers, speakers, microphones and a drum kit from the house, doused them with petrol, and set them ablaze. In northern Mali, religious war has been declared on music.</p> <p>When a rabble of different Islamist groups took control of the region in April there were fears that its rich culture would suffer. But no one imagined that music would almost cease to exist \u2013 not in Mali, a country that has become internationally renowned for its sound.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398262203\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/24/1351060787835/Toumani-Diabat--Malian-ko-007.jpg\" alt=\"Toumani Diabat\u00e9, Malian kora player in Bamako\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Toumani Diabat\u00e9, Malian kora player, in Bamako.

There isn't a single major music prize in the world today that hasn't been won by a Malian artist.\"</p> <p>\"Music regulates the life of every Malian,\" adds Cheich Tidiane Seck, a prolific Malian musician and producer. \"From the cradle to the grave. From ancient times right up to today. A Mali without music? No \u2026 I mean \u2026 give me another one!\"</p> <p>And yet that is the bland reality dawning on this once joy-filled land. International observers claim the leaders of the three armed Islamic groups who now control the northern Malian cities of Timbuktu, Kidal and Gao are motivated by money and power rather the dream of a caliphate in the Sahel. There are strong ties between these groups and the less than holy interests of major drug-traffickers and arms smugglers.</p> <p>But many of the mujahideen who have zoned in on the conflict from all over the Muslim world are fired by an unquestionable religious zeal. The same goes for Iyad Ag Ghaly, a Touareg strongman and born-again Salafist, who founded the Ansar-ud-Deen movement at the end of last year.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1PKdK_68r0A?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1PKdK_68r0A\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>\"He believes in what he's doing,\" says Manny Ansar, director of the Festival in the Desert that has been taking place every January in and around Timbuktu and Kidal since 2001. \"And that's what frightens me. I'm not convinced that he wants to kill everyone who is not a Muslim, like the people in al-Qaida do, but I've seen him giving up the fruits of this life for God.\"</p> <p>Back in the 1990s, before he succumbed to the preaching of the Pakistani proselytising movement Tablighi Jamaat, Ghaly liked to smoke cigarettes and hang out with musicians from <a href=\"http://youtu.be/N2B8wIOIeO8\">Tinariwen</a>. He even composed songs and poems of love, rebellion and the beauty of his desert home. Now music, and with it a major source of communal cohesion and well being, has either disappeared or gone underground throughout the territory under his control.</p> <p>An official decree banning all western music was issued on 22 August by a heavily bearded Islamist spokesman in the city of Gao. \"We don't want the music of Satan. Qur'anic verses must take its place. Sharia demands it,\" the decree says.</p> <p>The ban comes in the context of a horrifically literal and gratuitous application of Sharia law in all aspects of daily life. Militiamen are cutting off the hands and feet of thieves or stoning adulterers. Smokers, alcohol drinkers and women who are not properly attired are being publicly whipped. As one well-known Touareg musician from Kidal says: \"There's a lack of joy. No one is dancing. There are no parties. Everybody's under this kind of spell. It's strange.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398262204\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/24/1351060966001/Tinariwen-performing-at-t-009.jpg\" alt=\"Tinariwen performing at the World Cup 2010 Kickoff concert in Soweto, South Africa\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tinariwen, seen here performing at the World Cup 2010 Kickoff concert in Soweto, South Africa.

But the menace of al-Qaida started to have an effect on us in 2007. That's when al-Qaida people started to appear in the desert. They came to the nomad camps near Essakane [the beautiful dunes to the west of Timbuktu where the Festival in the Desert used to be held] and at first they were pleasant and said, 'Don't worry, we're Muslims like you.' Then they began to say, 'We have a common enemy, which is the west.' That's when I understood that things were going to get difficult.\"</p> <h2>The Kel Ansar<br></h2> <p>Remarkably, al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqim) never targeted the festival or any of the thousands of westerners who braved the journey to attend it. According to Ansar, some people put this down to the fact that his tribe, the Kel Ansar, are said to be descended directly from Muhammad and are highly revered. \"Others even thought that we cast spells to block their route,\" he says with a wry laugh. In truth, Aqim knew that if they wanted to keep the locals sweet and compliant, they were well advised not to mess with the Kel Ansar.</p> <p>Not all music events were so blessed. Returning from the Tamadacht festival near the eastern town of Anderamboukane in January 2009, a British tourist, Edwin Dyer, was kidnapped and sold to Aqim, who beheaded him four months later because the UK government refused to pay a ransom. It forced the Festival in the Desert to move into the safe confines of Timbuktu city limits in 2010.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398262205\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/24/1351061177889/U2-singer-Bono-attends-Ma-005.jpg\" alt=\"U2 singer Bono attends Mali's Festival in the Desert music festival in Timbuktu\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">U2 singer Bono attends Mali's Festival in the Desert music festival in Timbuktu.

The event was attended by Tinariwen, a host of other Touareg and Malian musicians and Bono.</p> <p>\"I was impressed by Bono's courage and that of his team,\" Manny says. \"He asked the soldiers who were assigned to protect him to leave him be and let him roam around the town freely or go and drink tea out on the dunes. But I wondered if I wasn't a bit mad myself to let him do that. I mean, Bono, kidnapped! Imagine that.\" La Maison, the hotel in Timbuktu where Bono and his entourage stayed, is now the headquarters of the city's Islamic tribunal.</p> <p>Manny felt like giving up when the rebellion erupted a few days after the end of the festival. But after talking to many musicians, as well as friends and international backers, he decided to organise a Caravan of Peace and Unity that will tour west Africa and visit refugee camps in February next year. He will also be promoting the Festival in the Desert in Exile in Europe, the Middle East, the US and elsewhere. \"It's my way of fighting back,\" he says. \"Before our music was heard in Essakane. Now it'll be heard in all the big festivals in the world. So it's the opposite of what the Islamists want. It's our victory and their defeat.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, almost all the musicians in the north have fled the country like more than 500,000 of their fellow Malians, most of whom languish in refugee camps in Algeria, Mauritania, Niger or Burkina Faso. It is the biggest humanitarian crisis the Sahel has ever known. \"There's no music up there any more,\" says Vieux Farka Tour\u00e9, son of the king of the West African blues, the late Ali Farka Tour\u00e9. \"You can't switch on a radio or a TV, even at home.\"</p> <p>The town of Niafunk\u00e9 just south west of Timbuktu, where Ali Farka Tour\u00e9 was mayor for many years, is now under Islamist control. \"I know that if Ali were to awake from his tomb today,\" says <a href=\"http://youtu.be/7UGaGY9ulP0\">Afel Bocoum</a>, Tour\u00e9's former sidekick and Albarn's partner on the 2002 Mali Music project, \"he would just go straight back into it. He would die twice.\" Both Bocoum and Vieux Farka Tour\u00e9 have fled south to the safety of the Malian capital, Bamako, with their families.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XtI0XXEeA2g?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"369\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XtI0XXEeA2g\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>But down south, music is also in crisis, for related reasons. The military coup that toppled President Amadou Toumani Tour\u00e9 on 23&#xa0;March and kissed goodbye to one of Africa's most lauded democracies has left the capital, Bamako, fearful and economically depressed. \"People just aren't used to meeting soldiers in the street, so they tend to stay at home,\" says Adam Thiam, one of Mali's leading journalists.</p> <p>Many live music venues in Bamako, such as Le Diplomat, where Diabat\u00e9 and his Symmetric Orchestra used to play every weekend, have closed. The same goes for hotels and restaurants, starved of their once plentiful foreign tourist clientele. Nightclubs and weddings are still thriving but the trend is to save money by hiring sound systems and DJs rather than live musicians. \"People use what they earn to feed themselves, not to have fun,\" says <a href=\"http://youtu.be/9rDQYImnzwU\">Bassekou Kouyate</a>.</p> <p>But in west Africa, when the going gets tough, the rappers get going. Like Y'en A Marre, a collective that ignited nationwide debate during Senegal's election crisis last year, rappers in Mali have stepped up to denounce political skulduggery, Islamism and military rule.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398262206\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/24/1351062118292/Malian-singer-Rokia-Traor-006.jpg\" alt=\"Malian singer Rokia Traor\u00e9\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Malian singer Rokia Traor\u00e9.

And in any case, they know that a Mali without music is an impossibility.\"</p> <p>Amkoullel set up his own pressure group of rappers, activists and friends called Plus Jamais \u00c7a (Never Again). So far he has released a couple of videos, including one called SOS, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMJWoDeBRcg\" title=\"\">which has become a YouTube hit</a>. It has also been censored by the state broadcaster ORTM, which is still under the heavy hand of the military.</p> <p>\"We had this feeling that a heavy blow had been dealt to democracy,\" Amkoullel says of the 23 March putsch. \"And it had been done in a period of popular disillusion. It's as if in the collective consciousness, democracy was a failure in Mali.\" Like <a href=\"http://youtu.be/De8vJbYIWjA\">Les Sofas de la Republique</a>, the other rap collective raising the standard in rhyme for unity, democracy, peace and good governance, Amkoullel and his team have been organising demonstrations, debates and gigs. He has also received three death threats.</p> <p>\"I knew that our phones were being bugged,\" he says. \"Then I got this call that was like, 'Yeah \u2026 we're watching you, so you'd better calm down or take the consequences.' The second message wasn't from the same person. 'You're talking too much,' they said. 'Shut up or you'll disappear and won't understand a thing.' That was much clearer!\"</p> <p>And yet, despite the twin-pronged threat to the culture they have made world famous, all the musicians of Mali agree it remains at the core of their identity. \"I'm a Muslim, but Sharia isn't my thing,\" says <a href=\"http://youtu.be/3DydY8bHTyg\">Rokia Traor\u00e9</a>, one of Mali's most famous international stars. \"If I couldn't go up on stage anymore, I would cease to exist. And without music, Mali will cease to exist.\"</p>",
  "<p>Mitt Romney used Monday night's debate to try and paint Barack Obama's foreign policy as weak, indecisive and dangerous for America on everything from confronting al-Qaida and Iran's nuclear weapons programme to Russian obstinacy.</p> <p>But on the detail, the Republican candidate frequently found himself in agreement with Obama as Romney tried not to scare voters weary of protracted and unnecessary wars, and confused and unsettled about events in the Middle East.</p> <p>On the big issues, Romney was often unable to draw a significant difference in how he would handle things as president. Take Iran. Romney has frequently accused Obama of being too slow and weak in applying pressure on Tehran over its nuclear programme.</p> <p>But in the debate, the Republican candidate was forced to concede that he would pursue much the same policy as the president \u2013 ever stronger sanctions in tandem with diplomacy \u2013 and that military action is a very last resort. </p> <p>Obama pounced.</p> <p>\"I'm glad that Governor Romney agrees with the steps that we're taking. You know, there have been times governor, frankly, during the course of this campaign, where it sounded like you thought that you'd do the same things we did, but you'd say them louder and somehow that would make a difference,\" he said.</p> <p>It was much the same on Syria. Romney has attacked Obama for not arming the rebels trying to topple President Bashar al-Assad, and for not intervening more after 30,000 deaths.</p> <p>The president \u2013 with one eye on Libya, and the flood of guns to Islamist rebels in Mali \u2013 said he is hesitant to send heavy weapons to Syrian insurgents about which little is known and with no control over where they might end up.</p> <p>\"What we can't do is suggest that giving heavy weapons to the Syrian opposition is a simple proposition that will make us safer in the long run,\" Obama said.</p> <p>Romney conceded the point.</p> <p>\"We do need to make sure that the arms do not get in the wrong hands,\" he said.</p> <p>He also agreed with Obama that he does not want to see the US military \"involved in Syria\".</p> <p>Romney went on to back the president on drone strikes in Pakistan, Yemen and elsewhere, an increasingly used military strategy that has drawn criticism in part over the large numbers of innocent civilians killed which in turn may be a spur to terrorism.</p> <p>\"I believe we should use any and all means necessary,\" Romney said. \"I support that entirely and feel the president was right to up the usage of that policy.\"</p> <p>Obama gave little ground. When Romney praised the president for the killing of Osama bin Laden, the president turned it on him.</p> <p>\"I'm glad that you recognise that al-Qaida is a threat, because a few months ago when you were asked what's the biggest geopolitical threat facing America, you said Russia not al-Qaida,\" he said. \"You said Russia, in the 1980s. They're now calling to ask for their foreign policy back because, you know, the cold war's been over for 20 years.\"</p> <p>Obama also highlighted Romney's shifting positions on Iraq and Afghanistan. Romney said he wanted to avoid similar wars in the future. The president used the opportunity to highlight that the Republican supported the invasion in 2003, and that he does not have the experience to have thought through many of his positions which were \"all over the map\".</p> <p>\"You say that you're not interested in duplicating what happened in Iraq. But just a few weeks ago, you said you think we should have more troops in Iraq right now,\" Obama said. \"I know you haven't been in a position to actually execute foreign policy but every time you've offered an opinion, you've been wrong. You said we should have gone into Iraq, despite that fact that there were no weapons of mass destruction. You said that we should still have troops in Iraq to this day.</p> <p>\"You indicated that we shouldn't be passing nuclear treaties with Russia despite the fact that 71 senators, Democrats and Republicans, voted for it. You said that, first, we should not have a timeline in Afghanistan. Then you said we should. Now you say maybe or it depends, which means not only were you wrong, but you were also confusing in sending mixed messages both to our troops and our allies.\"</p> <p>Romney found it difficult to shake off Obama's accusation of inconsistency while trying not to sound belligerent.</p> <p>Even on Israel, where the Republican candidate failed to land a punch. Romney repeated a a common maxim on the right that Obama has soured relations with the US's most important ally in the Middle East.</p> <p>But Israeli officials have said that whatever the differences on Iran and the Palestinians, the present White House has been unstinting in military and security assistance. Obama picked up the point, referring to \"unprecedented military and intelligence co-operation, including dealing with the Iranian threat\".</p> <p>Romney let it go.</p>",
  "<p><strong>Claim: Barack Obama, seeking to deride Mitt Romney, said that just as the navy needed fewer but larger ships, America's armed forces \"also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military has changed\".</strong></p> <p><strong>Fact:</strong> the US certainly use many fewer horses. The bayonet issue has been disputed, however, with many soldiers posting pictures of their bayonets online. In fact, old-fashioned bayonet charges are no longer part of US army basic training. The last time one was carried out in combat was in Korea in 1951. American soldiers were not issued bayonets for deployments to Iraq or Afghanistan, although knife combat is now taught to new recruits.</p> <p><strong>Claim: Obama said Romney had described Russia, not al-Qaida, as America's 'biggest geopolitical threat'.</strong></p> <p><strong>Fact:</strong> in a March interview this year, Romney told CNN that Russia was \"without question our number one geopolitical foe\". In Monday's debate, Romney claimed that \"in the same paragraph\" he had said Iran was the greatest national security threat. But Romney only mentioned Iran in March after being prompted by a surprised interviewer, and described Russia as the major power behind the world's \"terrible actors\".</p> <p><strong>Claim: according to Obama, Romney had said the US 'should have more troops in Iraq right now'.</strong></p> <p><strong>Fact:</strong> Romney had faulted Obama for the abrupt manner of the pullout from Iraq after Washington and Baghdad failed to negotiate a status of forces agreement giving US troops immunity from Iraqi prosecution, but did not directly argue for more troops.</p> <p><strong>Claim: Romney said Obama had been 'silent' over Iran's Green revolution in 2009 rather than speaking out in support of the protesters.</strong></p> <p><strong>Fact:</strong> Obama was initially reticent in part because his advisers feared that overt US support for the opposition during the 2009 election campaign would simply add weight to the depiction of them as western stooges by the Iranian president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. The White House also judged nuclear negotiations with Iran, then at a hopeful juncture, were its foreign policy priority. It was 10 days after the election, widely believed to have been rigged, before Obama condemned the violent suppression of demonstrators.</p> <p><strong>Claim: Romney said Syria was Iran's 'only ally in the Arab world' and Iran's 'route to the sea'. </strong></p> <p><strong>Fact:</strong> this seems to ignore Iran's 1,500-mile (2,400km) Gulf coastline, and the fact that Iran has no border with Syria.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 26 October 2012 to remove a section about Romney's claim that he would indict the Iranian president, Ahmadinejad, under the genocide convention, claiming he had incited genocide against Israel. The article said the convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide does not list incitement as an indictable offence. In fact it does.</p>",

In a comment article, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/23/badger-cull-policy-bovine-tb\">Damian Carrington, the Guardian's head of environment, says Paterson should abandon the policy for good.</a></p> <p><strong>\u2022 Michael Gove has accused Ed Miliband of being a \"small-c conservative\" because of his resistance to modernisation.</strong> In a speech, Gove said that Miliband's \"one nation Labour\" speech illustrated not a move to the centre but an \"explicit disavowal\" of the centrism practised under Tony Blair's leadership. Gove also said that the \"blue Labour\" philosophy favoured by Miliband was \"anti-globalisation, explicitly anti-liberal and proudly protective of the past\".</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Blue Labour thinking - Ed Miliband's thinking - is not then a continuation or refashioning of Blairism, it is a critique and rejection of Blairism.</p> <p>It's an attempt to repudiate the period in the party's recent past when wealth creation was welcomed, when spin doctors argued education reform would mean a move away from the bog-standard comprehensive, when the director's box at the Emirates was preferred to the Durham Miners' Gala.</p> <p>That is why it is a fundamental mistake ... to see Ed Miliband's One Nation speech as a move to the centre.</p> <p>It was an explicit disavowal of the centrism practised under Tony Blair and a celebration of an older, more solidaristic socialism of the kind which would have found favour with Tony Crosland or even Tony Benn.</p> <p>Where Tony Blair used his speeches to identify the forces of conservatism and declare war on them, Ed Miliband has used his speech to celebrate the forces of conservatism and declare he wants to become their leader.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 Gove has said that he is writing to MPs in areas of \"concentrated educational under-performance\" to encourage them to support his bid for more primaries to become academies.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I want the MPs in those cities to work with me to persuade their local authorities and their local communities that we need rapidly to improve their schools. They have a simple choice: stand with those in the academies and free schools movement who want to put children first; or stand with the adults who are blocking school improvement.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2012/oct/23/suspects-remanded-shortage-court-interpreters\">MPs have been told that suspects are being needlessly remanded in custody and denied a fair trial because of a severe shortage of qualified court interpreters</a>.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20040340\"> The European parliament has voted for a 6.8% increase in the EU's budget</a>.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/oct/23/london-2012-olympics-paralympics-cost\"> Hugh Robertson, the sports minister, has published figures showing that the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games came in \u00a3377m under budget</a>.</strong> The overall cost of the Games is now forecast to be \u00a38.921bn from a budget of \u00a39.298bn.</p> <p>That's all from me for today.</p> <p>Thanks for the comments.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-23T15:25:46.012Z\">at 4.25pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5086a68958f96784ee2909e8\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-23T14:25:06.348Z\">3.25pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>Here's an afternoon reading list.</p> <p><a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/thetorydiary/2012/10/by-paul-goodman-leave-the-row-about-the-eu-budget-and-swoop-on-a-sentence-in-a-speech-that-william-hague-will-give-in-berlin.html\">\u2022 Paul Goodman at ConservativeHome says it is now possible to imagine David Cameron supporting Britain leaving the EU.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>What will the Prime Minister do [if other EU member states refuse a renegotiation]? After all, he is adamant that he wants Britain to remain within the E.U. There are two possibilities. The first is that he sticks to his view. The second is that he shrugs his shoulders and recommends that Britain pull out. Extraordinary as it may seem, the latter course is now possible. I am not sure that the significance of the Gove intervention - the Education Secretary's admission that he would vote to pull out of the EU were there an In-Out referendum today - has been fully grasped. It marked the moment when a view held by roughly half of party activists and a significant percentage of Tory MPs was backed without reproof at Cabinet level - and by the Government's most successful senior Minister at that, and one who may yet be, for all his protestations to the contrary, a future party leader.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://nottspolitics.org/2012/10/22/do-government-chief-whips-have-an-afterlife-2/\">\u2022 David Butler at Ballots and Bullets writes about what happens to chief whips after they move.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Few ex-Chief Whips however became very important on the political stage.

We have all worked tirelessly to prepare for the delivery of this government policy to see us finally get on top of this terrible disease.</p> <p>But there have been a series of obstacles, not least the appalling weather, delays because of the Olympics and Paralympics, and the legal challenges from those against the policy. And let\u2019s be clear, the numbers from the badger population survey last week, which demonstrated just how large the badger numbers are, have left us with a huge challenge to ensure we achieve the targets needed for disease control.</p> <p>We have always said that this has to be a science-led policy to reduce disease and we have to be confident of achieving the numbers needed for disease reduction. As we rapidly approach winter the odds of achieving that number decrease. This is why, reluctantly, we have taken the decision, with the companies involved, to delay until late spring next year.</p> <p>For those that have suggested that this cull is irresponsible, I think today\u2019s decision shows that this is simply not the case. Postponement is the most responsible thing to do. We have said all along that this has never been about killing badgers; this has always been about eradicating disease. It has been about the battle to get on top of the TB on our farms that strikes at the very heart of our beef and dairy herds.</p> <p>This has been a very tough year for farmers, which has lent its own set of challenges. In preparing to deliver on this government\u2019s TB eradication policy we have met with delay after delay; challenge after challenge. But I am proud of the way that farmers have worked together and shown great resilience in the face of not inconsiderable opposition - and for that I want to thank them.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-23T13:35:02.519Z\">at 2.35pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5086955ac0e343ef1abc7f4c\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-23T13:02:19.008Z\">2.02pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The statement is now over.</p> <p>So much for one nation.

It used to be isolated. But it has spread extensively through the west of England and Wales. Cases are doubling every nine years. Last year some 26,000 cattle were slaughtered at a cost of \u00a3100m. Over the next 10 years it could cost \u00a3500m, he says.</p> <p>Last week the government announced plans for a new testing regime.</p> <p>Cattle and badgers can transmit the disease to each other. Culling badgers can cut transmission to cattle if it is carried out over a large enough area and for a significant length of time.</p> <p>That is why the government thinks culling badgers can make a significant contribution.</p> <p>The NFU has taken the lead in preparing the pilot culls.</p> <p>Paterson says he has been \"immensely impressed\" by the work done by the NFU. And he thanks the police for their help.</p> <p>The severe bad weather this summer has caused problems.</p> <p>Legal problems, and the police request for the cull to start after the Olympics, mean the government has missed the best time to start the cull.</p> <p>New figures also show that there are more badgers in the pilot area than thought.</p> <p>For a cull to be successful, 70% of badgers have to be culled.</p> <p>Farmers now say they cannot be confident of culling 70% of the badgers, partly because of the higher numbers and the delays.</p> <p>The companies due to carry out the culls have written to Paterson asking him to delay the culls until next summer.</p> <p>Paterson says he has placed a copy of the letter in the library of the Commons.</p> <p>Starting next summer will ensure that the culls can conform to the scientific criteria and the evidence base.</p> <p>This will be disappointing, Paterson says. But he fully supports the decision of the NFU.</p> <p>The government is still committed to the policy. But it wants to work with the NFU to get the policy right.</p> <p>It wants to have a TB-free England.</p> <p>Vaccination would be another option. But it will be some years before a viable cattle vaccine is available, he says.</p> <p>Paterson says he is utterly convinced that culling is the right thing do to.</p> <p>He wants the culls to be delivered safely next summer.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-23T11:50:07.906Z\">at 12.50pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50867f9bc0e343ef1abc7f21\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-23T11:29:32.057Z\">12.29pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>My colleague Adam Vaughan has been speaking to <strong>Brian May</strong>, who has been one of the leaders of the anti-culling campaign.

Surely, you might think, having waited more than seven decades after the invention of the goggle box for our first debates no one would want to stop them now? Oh yes, they would.</p> <p>In the US there was a gap of 16 years after the first debate in 1960. After Kennedy\u2019s charm trumped Nixon\u2019s gruffness American voters had to wait until Gerald Ford faced Jimmy Carter in 1976. Prime ministerial debates in Australia and Canada have been irregular too.

I will have vanished into obscurity long before he wins his fourth election victory. The suggestion you\u2019re making is absurd.\u201d Posed the inevitable question last weekend, Theresa May answered: \u201cWe have a first-class leader at the moment [my italics]. David Cameron is dealing with the issues that he was left by the last government very well indeed.\u201d This fell short by some distance of the grandiloquent encomium required.</p> <p>There can be no doubt about it. The Home Secretary is, as Tory MPs would put it, \u201con manoeuvres\u201d \u2013 discreet ones, to be sure, but unmistakable for all that ...</p> <p>It is not as though Mr Cameron has an obvious successor. The three front-runners to succeed him are Michael Gove, Boris Johnson and George Osborne. The first claims not to want to do so. The second lacks the means (since he isn\u2019t an MP and will still be Mayor of London if he becomes one after the next election). And the third will lack the capacity if the Conservatives fail to win a majority next time round: he will go down with Mr Cameron, his friend, in such an event \u2013 one still more likely than not, given the collapse of the boundary review. So Tory MPs are quietly casting around for who could next lead them in Opposition.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/britains-postgrad-crisis-puts-us-on-the-same-level-as-kazakhstan-8222047.html\">\u2022 Richard Garner in the Independent says Britain is one of only three countries in Europe where fewer than 10% of students go on to post-graduate study.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>In most major European countries, between 15 and 24 per cent of students continue with their studies after gaining an undergraduate degree.

Cocks would dispatch Harrison to bawl threats through the letterboxes of absent backbenchers, and his carpeting of the Left-winger Tom Litterick for missing a confidence vote (he was holidaying in Crete) was audible well beyond the confines of the Whips\u2019 Office.</p> <p>To get the government\u2019s business through \u2014 or vice versa when in opposition \u2014 Harrison developed an array of wheezes. They included getting three members to vote each way in a committee to make it look as if a quorum were present (for which Mellish apologised to the House), and blocking one of the division lobbies (undertaken with Scottish Nationalists to prevent the Tories winning a vote against devolution).</p> <p>One day in May 1968 he was whipping on two Committees at once when a vote was called on the Finance Bill. He arrived just as the door was closing, forced his way through and voted. When the Shadow Chancellor Iain Macleod challenged his vote, Harrison said he had been three-quarters in and had pulled his leg in after him. The chairman declared the vote carried by 22\u00be to 22.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-23T11:09:12.842Z\">at 12.09pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50866eb1c0e343ef1abc7eef\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-23T10:17:21.479Z\">11.17am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>My colleague <strong>Severin Carrell</strong> has filed a story on the resignation of two SNP MSPs over the Nato decision.

The way in Britain Lisbon was ratified without any consultation of the voters has played a part in that. People feel that the EU is a one way process, a great machine that sucks up decision-making from national parliaments to the European level until everything is decided by the EU.

  "<p>The final presidential debate is in the books. President Barack Obama emerged a clear winner in my and most people's opinion. Dominating in tone, Obama forced Mitt Romney on the defensive many times throughout the night. Romney, for his part, seemed satisfied to agree with the president rather than challenge him on policy on a slew of issues.</p> <p>The post-debate insta-polls indicate that most viewers also thought Obama had won. He won the <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57537795/poll-decisive-win-for-obama-in-final-debate/?tag=MaxDeep\">CBS/Knowledge Networks</a> poll of undecided voters, 53% to 23%, the <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/10/22/cnn-poll-who-won-the-debate/\">CNN/ORC</a> poll of registered voter debate watchers, 48% to 40%, and a <a href=\"http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2012/10/obama-wins-debate-by-11-points-in-swing-states.html\">Public Policy Polling</a> (PPP) survey of swing state debate watchers, 53% to 42%. The question is: did the debate change anything?</p> <p>One factor that indicates that it might have is that Obama won the CBS \"undecideds\" poll by a greater margin in this debate than <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/17/hofstra-presidential-debate-instapolls-obama-romney\">Romney won the first</a>. That's pretty amazing considering that most analysts would agree that Romney had one of the best debate performances in modern history at the first debate, in Denver. Another reason it's noteworthy is because Romney picked up 4 points in the national polls there and, in doing so, turned this race into a dead heat after the first debate. That precedent would be very encouraging for Obama if a big win in the third debate had such an impact.</p> <p>The other polls, however, lead me to the exact opposite conclusion. Although 43% of the PPP swing state respondents were Democrats, as opposed to 37% who identified as Republicans, only 37% of PPP respondents said the debate made them more likely to back Obama. This compares to a slightly higher 38% who said they were more likely to back Romney after Monday night. The reason Romney picked up slightly more support in a poll with more self-identified Democrats is because 47% of independents said they were more likely to back Romney, compared to only 32% of independents who said the debate made them more likely to back Obama. The CNN poll of all debate watchers similarly found that 25% of respondents were more likely to vote for Romney and only 24% were more likely to back Obama because of the debate. </p> <p>Is the CBS poll picking up on something the other polls are not? We don't know. It could just be that the finding from the CNN and PPP polls is true of the CBS survey: voters thought that President Obama won on debate style points, but were not so convinced as to change their minds on their voting choice. It could also be that by zoning in on undecided voters, the CBS poll is picking up on a trend that will become clear in the upcoming days: partisans remain committed to their candidate, while the few undecided voters left start slowly falling into the president's column. </p> <p>What may help determine what effect the debate will have is <a href=\"http://themonkeycage.org/blog/2012/10/02/why-news-coverage-of-the-debate-may-matter-more-than-the-debate/\">the media reaction</a>. The media can drive the story for days, and the millions of viewers who were watching Monday Night Football or the National League Championship Series Game 7 will get the media-filtered narrative about the debate, rather than the debate itself.</p> <p>Will the media play up the fact that Romney passed the commander-in-chief test, as <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/10/mitt-romney-keeps-command-amid-attacks-and-looks-to-future/\">ABC is doing</a>? Will they say Romney was too meek, as <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chucktodd/status/260564294876418048\">NBC's Chuck Todd argues</a> they might? The few undecided voters might finally align themselves with a candidate depending on which narrative gets more traction.</p> <p>The differing initial stories suggest that the message from the media for this final debate will not be clear enough for either candidate to make gains. And this makes sense when we put this debate into the larger context of the campaign \u2013 most voters are not voting on foreign policy. </p> <p>Americans are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/22/third-presidential-debate-swing-romney-obama\">voting on the economy</a>. Voters may feel that President Obama has a better handling of foreign affairs, but this edge isn't large enough to make Mitt Romney unacceptable. In the CNN post-debate poll, viewers felt that Obama would be a better commander-in-chief by only 3 percentage points: that's not a terribly large lead for the incumbent, and certainly not enough to disqualify a challenger who leads on who would better manage the economy. </p> <p>This race looks to be heading towards a photo finish in 14 days, and all things considered, this debate will probably have minimal impact. Still, I would note that even the smallest movement among undecideds in a very tight race can make all the difference in the world. Another few days of polling will tell us whether this debate has had any effect.</p>",

If you have emailed us and your message has bounced back, please try resending it to us again.</p> <p>The US presidential debates are over and, with less than two weeks before the election on 6 November, it's time for Barack Obama and Mitt Romney to hit the hustings in earnest. While Obama continues to enjoy great popularity around much of the world, at home the candidates are neck and neck in a race that looks set to go right to the wire.</p> <p>Doubtless if the election were opened up globally it would be settled quickly. But, as <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/garyyounge\" title=\"\">Gary Younge </a>writes in our cover story, would all that international faith in President Obama be justified? As Younge points out, Monday's final debate laid bare how little variation exists between Republican and Democratic foreign policy. When all is said and done, the outcome may not alter the world beyond the US as much as many people imagine.</p> <p>Inside the paper, as ever, we bring you the sharpest news and insights from around the world. In Europe a new report highlights the social and political danger of a \"lost generation\" of 16- to 25-year-olds not in education, employment or training (often referred to as \"Neets\"), even claiming this disenfranchised youth movement could soon incite the continent's own Arab spring.</p> <p>Life in the Arab spring nations themselves shows depressingly little sign of settling down. A year after the death of Muammar Gaddafi, Guardian correspondent <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/chris-stephen\" title=\"\">Chris Stephen</a> finds Libya still gripped by chaos and disenchantment. In Lebanon, meanwhile, the assassination of a security general has pushed sectarian tensions to the very brink.</p> <p>More encouraging news from Somalia, though, where civil war has raged for 20 years but where Mogadishu's football stadium is once again being used for playing football, and not as an army base.</p> <p>On the western side of Africa, Nigeria's authorities have embraced the Afrobeat pioneer <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fela_Kuti\" title=\"\">Fela Kuti</a> \u2013 one of the country's most anti-establishment figures \u2013 by funding the conversion of the late musician's old house into a museum.</p> <p>Many outsiders look at the growing discord between Japan and its neighbours and wonder why the country still provokes such hostility in east Asia. The harrowing stories of those like South Korea's \"comfort women\", forcibly conscripted into Japanese army brothels during the second world war, go some way to providing an answer. Seventy years on, reports <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/justinmccurry\" title=\"\">Justin McCurry</a>, the surviving women are still campaigning for formal acknowledgement of their plight from the Japanese government.</p> <p>Elsewhere, Richard Leiby from our partner publication The Washington Post was among a small group of reporters given a military escort to the Swat valley school attended by Malala Yousafzai, the schoolgirl who was shot in the head by the Taliban earlier this month. While Pakistan's authorities were keen to convey a sense of calm, the students Leiby spoke to were less convinced.</p> <p>From the UK, the Observer's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/tobyhelm\" title=\"\">Toby Helm </a>reports on a week of resignations and policy reversals for the Conservatives, while we also reveal how several big multinational firms manage to avoid paying much tax in Britain.</p> <p>In Review we have a report on where the next global killer pandemic might emerge from (clue: think twice before exploring remote African caves filled with bats).

In Books, the BBC's business editor <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/correspondents/robertpeston/\" title=\"\">Robert Peston</a>, who was one of the first to foresee the credit crunch, has a new book detailing how it all went wrong (but which is less specific on how to put it all right again).</p> <p>It all adds up to another Guardian Weekly full of diverse news and viewpoints.

And put that pillow away.</p> <p><strong>I was just resting my eyes.</strong> Earlier this week, ahead of the final debate, the satirical website <a href=\"http://www.theonion.com/articles/romneylabs-concocts-doomsday-zinger-capable-of-swi,30016/\" title=\"\">the Onion described how the Republicans' \"microbiologists, chemists and physicists\" were working on a doomsday zinger</a> that \"could eradicate the entire Obama campaign in .03 seconds\".</p> <p><strong>And is that how it turned out? </strong>If anything, Obama appears to have won the war of the zingers. On Monday, after Romney complained that the US navy is smaller than it has been been since 1917, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/us-news-blog/2012/oct/23/horses-and-bayonets-presidential-debate\" title=\"\">the President hit back that Romney doesn't understand the modern military</a>. The US also has \"fewer horses and bayonets\" than it did in 1917!</p> <p><strong>Take that! Mitt must have been devastated.</strong> There's more! \"We have these things called aircraft carriers,\" Obama continued. \"We have these ships that go underwater \u2013 nuclear submarines!\"</p> <p><strong>Kapow! Once more, Romney is made to seem out of touch with reality. So this is the end of his presidential hopes?</strong> You haven't got a clue about political analysis, have you?</p> <p><strong>Of course not.</strong> If that was the case we'd be talking about a knockout punch.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> \"That must hurt!\"</p> <p><strong>Don't say:</strong> \"This is just painful.\"</p>",
  "<h2>Israel and the Palestinians</h2> <p>For decades a focal point of US foreign policy, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was a notable absence in Monday's presidential debate.</p> <p>The only mention came when Mitt Romney was listing Barack Obama's supposed lack of progress in his first term: \"Are Israel and the Palestinians closer to reaching a peace agreement?\" the Republican candidate asked. \"No. They haven't had talks in two years.\"</p> <p>The lack of discussion reflects an agenda that is changing, partly as a result of upheaval elsewhere in the region and partly as a result of conscious efforts by the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, to talk down the local conflict and talk up the threat from the Iranian nuclear programme. But it will deepen the disillusionment of many Palestinians with the commitment of the US to resolve the conflict, and perhaps increase their resolve to pursue alternative strategies, such as the bid for enhanced status at the United Nations.</p> <p><strong>Harriet Sherwood in Jerusalem</strong></p> <h2>Iran</h2> <p>The candidates restated long-held positions. Asked by the moderator, Bob Schieffer, whether an attack by Iran on Israel would be considered an attack on the US, both said they would stand by Israel. (The more pertinent question \u2013 what would be your response if Israel unilaterally launched an attack? \u2013 came later, and got no answer.)</p> <p>Obama highlighted the difference between his position and Romney's: \"The disagreement I have with Governor Romney is that during the course of this campaign he has often talked as if we should take premature military action. I think that would be a mistake.\"</p> <p>Romney spoke of the need to tighten sanctions and take further steps to isolate the Iranian regime diplomatically. \"Of course, military action is a last resort,\" he said. \"It is something one would only consider if all of the other avenues had been tried to their full extent.\"</p> <p>In a cutting riposte, Obama said: \"There have been times, governor, frankly, during the course of this campaign, where it sounded like you thought that you would do the some things we did, but you'd say them louder and somehow that that would make a difference.\"</p> <p>Volume, tone and perception count, of course. But on substance there may be little to choose between the two candidates.</p> <p><strong>Harriet Sherwood</strong></p> <h2>China</h2> <p>Romney <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/23/mitt-romney-china-currency-manipulator\" title=\"\">renewed his pledge to label China a currency manipulator \"on day one\"</a>, arguing that the US was losing a silent trade war with the world's second-largest economy.</p> <p>Overall, the Republican candidate took a milder stance towards Beijing, telling viewers on Tuesday night: \"We can be a partner with China; we don't have to be an adversary in any way, shape or form.\"</p> <p>But asked if he was formally accusing China of manipulating the yuan, and sparking a trade war, he replied: \"There's one going on right now, which we don't know about it. It's a silent one, and they're winning.\"</p> <p>\"We have to say to our friend in China \u2026 you can't keep on holding down the value of your currency, stealing our intellectual property, [and] counterfeiting our products [and] selling them around the world, even to the United States.\"</p> <p>The US has not labelled China a currency manipulator since 1994, though successive administrations have considered doing so. Some observers doubt whether Romney would actually follow through on his claims.</p> <p><strong>Tania Branigan in Beijing</strong></p> <h2>Africa</h2> <p>As expected, the 49 countries of sub-Saharan Africa hardly registered in the final US presidential debate.</p> <p>\"Africa\" came up only once, when Barack Obama said: \"Our alliances have never been stronger: in Asia, in Europe, in Africa, with Israel.\"</p> <p>The sole reference to South Africa was to the era of white-minority rule, two decades ago. It came when Mitt Romney said, of Iran: \"I would also make sure that their diplomats are treated like the pariah[s] they are around the world, the same way we treated the apartheid diplomats of South Africa.\"</p> <p>There was also a brief mention of Somalia, when Obama remarked: \"We created partnerships throughout the region to deal with extremism in Somalia, in Yemen, in Pakistan.\" The US has carried out drone strikes, and provided equipment and training to the African Union peacekeeping force that drove al-Qaida-linked militants out of their strongholds in Somalia.</p> <p>At one point Romney noted: \"Mali has been taken over \u2013 the northern part of Mali \u2013 by al-Qaida-type individuals.\"</p> <p>But after four years in which a president whose father was Kenyan raised hopes but failed to set Africa alight, the slim pickings came as little surprise on a continent accustomed to being far down the global agenda.</p> <p>Daniel Silke, a political analyst based in Cape Town, South Africa, tweeted: \"#Africa barely exists in final #Obama #Romney Presidential debate last night.\"</p> <p>Another tweeter, named Bevan, posted: \"Africa only mentioned twice in whole debate (Obama/Romney),hope fellow Africans took note. Only Africans can n will develop Africa for all.\"</p> <p>Jacques Sibomana, an entrepreneur, tweeted: \"And Africa yet became a forgotten Continent during the debate #Romney and #Obama.\"</p> <p>Last week, two analysts, Witney Schneidman and Andrew Westbury, <a href=\"http://allafrica.com/stories/201210191196.html\" title=\"\">issued a plea</a> for Schieffer to ask the candidates about Africa. They wrote: \"We urge you to use your privilege as moderator to direct the country's attention to a part of the world that has never been more important, but seemingly never so neglected as it concerns American foreign policy priorities: sub-Saharan Africa.\" It appears Schieffer failed to heed them.</p> <p><strong>David Smith in Johannesburg</strong></p> <h2>Pakistan</h2> <p>As with many other parts of the foreign policy debate, there was no daylight between the two candidates on Pakistan, with Mitt Romney using his time to try to demonstrate that he has some understanding of the country.</p> <p>He listed all the well-worn problems that, in the eyes of many US foreign policy experts, make Pakistan a troublesome country, albeit one the US can never afford to ignore.</p> <p>\"It is not time to divorce a nation on Earth that has 100 nuclear weapons and is on the road to double that at some point,\" Romney said.</p> <p>Repeated reference was made to Pakistan's nuclear stockpile, including to the prospect of the country, of 180 million people, one day having more nuclear weapons than Britain.</p> <p>He also noted the presence in Pakistan of the Haqqani network, an Afghan insurgent faction allied to the Taliban that has recently been designated a terrorist group by the US, and the threat that Taliban-sympathising ethnic Pashtuns in Pakistan may pose to Afghanistan after the end of the US combat mission, in 2014.</p> <p>He said: \"This is a nation which, if it becomes a failed state \u2026 there are nuclear weapons there, and you have terrorists that can grab those nuclear weapons.\"</p> <p>With the stakes so high, Romney was never going to forgo any tools for dealing with Pakistan, including the supposedly secret drone programme run by the CIA. Although the unmanned aircraft are a major source of friction between Pakistan and the US, Romney said the US must use \"any and all means necessary\" to target terrorists. \"I support that entirely, and feel the president was right to up the usage of that policy,\" he said.</p> <p>For his part, Obama simply let his record stand, using his time during the Afghanistan and Pakistan section to turn swiftly back to domestic policy, saying his strategy of building up the Afghan security forces would allow the US to divert resources to \"nation-building\" in the US.</p> <p><strong>Jon Boone in Islamabad</strong></p> <h2>Russia</h2> <p>Obama attempted to paint Romney as out of touch by recalling his Republican challenger's statement that Russia was the United States's \"number one political foe\". He upped the ante a bit by saying Romney had called Russia the country's number one political \"threat\". Romney corrected him on that later in the debate: the main threat, he insisted, was Iran.</p> <p>\"The 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back,\" Obama said, recalling Romney's words. \"Because the cold war has been over for 20 years.\"</p> <p>That's what some Russians have been saying all along. Shortly after Romney made the statement, earlier this year, Dmitry Medvedev, Russia's prime minister, advised the candidates to \"check their clocks from time to time. It's 2012, not the mid-1970s.\"</p> <p>The hardliners inside Russia, including Vladimir Putin, instead welcomed the statement as \"blunt\" and \"straightforward\". They are likely to do the same with the thoughts Romney aired during the debate.</p> <p>\"I'm not going to wear rose-coloured glasses when it comes to Russia or Mr Putin,\" Romney said, noting that \"Russia does continue to battle us in the UN, time and time again\". He also noted Moscow's recent withdrawal from the Nunn-Lugar agreement on arms clean-up as a sign of receding US influence in the world.</p> <p>With US-Russian relations spiralling to new post-cold war lows, it will be hard for Russia's leaders to disagree with any of that. Many will probably be happy simply to know that someone in Washington DC has noticed.</p> <p><strong>Miriam Elder in Moscow</strong></p> <h2>Europe </h2> <p>\"Our alliances,\" said Obama, \"have never been stronger: in Asia, in Europe, in Africa, with Israel.\"</p> <p>And for Europeans, that was it. The sole reference to Europe in the debate was a perfunctory passing remark from the president; the word Europe did not cross the lips of Romney at all.</p> <p>There was no eurocrisis, despite the Obama administration's worries about how the sovereign debt troubles might affect his re-election prospects, and despite the transatlantic pressure, on the Germans especially, to get to grips with the crisis.</p> <p>Germany was not mentioned once, and France just once, along with Britain, in another throwaway remark, contrasting high US defence spending with the thriftiness of others.</p> <p>The special relationship? The UK warranted one further single mention, Romney simply noting that Pakistan will soon have more nuclear warheads than Britain.</p> <p>But failure to mention Europe may be just the way the Europeans want it. After talking to French and European diplomats, Lib\u00e9ration's <a href=\"http://washington.blogs.liberation.fr/great\\_america/\" title=\"\">Washington blog</a> sensed they were OK with the fact that Europe had \"disappeared from America's radar\", happy that Obama was not blaming the eurozone crisis as a source of US economic woe, and that Romney had stopped riffing on the dangers of \"European socialism\" (in other words, the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande).</p> <p>Both <a href=\"http://www.lepoint.fr/dossiers/monde/election-presidentielle-americaine-2012/le-troisieme-debat-romney-un-obama-bis-23-10-2012-1519983\\_539.php\" title=\"\">Le Point</a> and <a href=\"http://www.lefigaro.fr/elections-americaines/2012/10/23/01040-20121023ARTFIG00278-face-a-romney-obama-l-emporte-sans-creuser-l-ecart.php\" title=\"\">Le Figaro</a> felt that Romney had passed the test of leadership stature by keeping calm and succeeding in coming across as a plausible possible president.</p> <p>In a taster of its front-page editorial, Le Monde said: \"Point taken: foreign politics plays no role in the American election. On 6 November, voters will decide on one issue alone: the economy.\"</p> <p>Despite the irrelevance of Europe to the campaign, European elites are, of course, keenly watching the US election. Support for Obama is overwhelming, even if disappointment with the last four years is palpable; wariness of Romney is widespread.</p> <p>A BBC opinion poll released on Monday showed sweeping support in Europe for Obama, with France, perhaps surprisingly, returning stronger backing for the incumbent than anywhere else in the world, 72% to 2% for Romney. Two-thirds of British and Germans supported Obama, while Romney enjoyed 7% and 8% levels. The poll was conducted last month.</p> <p>Romney's highest European support came from Poland. But even that was a niggardly 16%, probably because of the Republican contender's relatively hard line on Russia.</p> <p><strong>Ian Traynor in Brussels and Angelique Chrisafis in Paris</strong></p> <h2>Latin America</h2> <p>It may be next door to the US with a population of 590 million people and some of the world's fastest growing economies, but Latin America barely received a mention during Monday night's debate.</p> <p>Obama failed to refer to anything on the continent south of the Rio Grande. Romney briefly accused the president of showing weakness towards Fidel Castro and Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and failing to take better advantage of the trade opportunities in the region, but the total time devoted to Latin America in the 90-minute-long debate was about 20 seconds.</p> <p>The sense of rejection was evident in the regional and Hispanic media.</p> <p>\"<a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/ABC_Univision/Politics/obama-romney-care-latin-america-mexico-brazil-cuba/story?id=17508488#.UIZBmmka8eY\" title=\"\">Obama and Romney Don't Care About Latin America</a>,\" said ABC-Univision, a major Spanish-language media group. Online commentators noted there was no mention of the drug war raging just across the Rio Grande in Mexico, insecurity in Central America, or free trade with Colombia.</p> <p>\"<a href=\"http://veja.abril.com.br/noticia/internacional/em-ultimo-debate-candidatos-tentam-conquistar-indecisos\" title=\"\">Nobody loves our Latin America very much</a>,\" wrote Caio Binder, a correspondent for Brazil's Veja magazine. Binder said Romney also got his numbers wrong in his brief mention of the region.</p> <p>In a positive description of the trade opportunity that the US had so far failed to take advantage of, Romney said: \"As a matter of fact, Latin America's economy is almost as big as the economy of China. We're all focused on China. Latin America is a huge opportunity for us \u2013 time zone, language opportunities.\"</p> <p>Binder commented acidly: \"Wrong, governor: According to the IMF, the GDP of Latin America (and the Caribbean) in 2011 was $ 5.6tn, while that of China was $7.3tn.\" Nonetheless, he said Romney had scored a point among Latin American voters for at least mentioning the region.</p> <p>The lack of attention to the region may disappoint the 21 million eligible Hispanic voters in the US, who are seen as potential deciders in three swing states \u2013 Florida, Nevada and Colorado. In Florida, they are particularly strongly represented with 16% of eligible voters.</p> <p>Nationwide, polls suggest Obama has the support of about 65% support of this group, compared with 35% for Romney. In Florida they are almost level.</p> <p>But Romney's mentions of Ch\u00e1vez, Castro and trade prompted his supporters to claim he had made the case to Hispanic voters.</p> <p>\"I was very gratified that it was Mitt Romney who brought up Latin America, who talked of doing more trade with the region, and was the one who said we have issues in Venezuela, we have issues in Cuba,\" Hector Barreto, who chairs a Romney support group, told NBC.</p> <p>Obama's team claimed the president's actions spoke louder than his words. \"Two passing references to Latin America in a debate does not change the fundamentals of the president's record on Latin America: No president has visited the region more times, in his first four years in office, exports are up more than 50%, we have new free trade agreements with Colombia, and Panama, and all of that is a function of his leadership,\" said Dan Restrepo, who was the administration's top Latin America adviser.</p> <p>The oversight of Latin America was largely due to the moderator Bob Schieffer who choose not to raise related issues, such as regional diplomacy, trade, drug control and immigration. But language may also be a partial explanation. Although Romney talked of Latin America's \"language opportunities\" for the US and although most Hispanics in the US speak English, the two candidates were less enthused to raise Latin American issues in this debate in English compared to interviews they have given to the Spanish language media.</p> <p><strong>Jonathan Watts in Rio de Janeiro</strong></p> <h2>Asia </h2> <p>Neither Obama nor Romney mentioned anywhere in Asia but China during the debate, despite the fact that America's presence in the region has involved a considerable number of south-east Asian nations in recent months, and that only looks set to increase.</p> <p>The US secretary of defence, Leon Panetta, visited Vietnam in June to promote greater ties between the former foes and stabilise a move whereby 60% of America's naval ships will be based in Asia Pacific by 2020. Then, last month in Jakarta, the secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, encouraged a regionally unified code of conduct for the 10 members of the Association of South-east Asian Nations (Asean) in dealing with China over territorial disputes in the South China Sea (Clinton later went on to visit both Timor-Leste and Brunei).</p> <p>And in the US, Obama met Aung San Suu Kyi of Burma, who was allowed for the first time in two decades to visit the US, and was awarded Congress's highest medal. That meeting was followed by the easing of many of the travel restrictions and sanctions against the former pariah nation, and, just last week, the US military's invitation to Burma to participate in a joint Thai-American military drill involving south-east and east Asian nations. That invitation was the US's first such engagement with Burma since 1988.</p> <p>With some analysts expecting the region to be at the centre of any US-Chinese disagreements over shared geopolitical interests, such as the South China Sea, one may very well expect to hear more about south-east Asia in the near future.</p> <p><strong>Kate Hodal in Bangkok</strong></p>",
  "<p>Opinions will be divided over Monday night's final presidential debate, but for Glenn Heffner, a Romney volunteer in the bellwether town of Mentor in Ohio, the take-home message was clear: his man did the job that was needed and metamorphosed on camera into a president.</p> <p>\"I think Romney demonstrated that he is presidential, that he can lead this country not only here but internationally as well. The president of America is not only our leader, he is in a real sense president of the world.\"</p> <p>Two weeks ago Heffner, aged 66, had a couple of stents put in his heart. Now he's back up, knocking on doors and making calls, showing the determination that Mitt Romney is hoping will put him in the White House.</p> <p>Lake County is a microcosm of Ohio, and Ohio is a microcosm of America. The saying is that as Ohio goes so goes the country \u2013 the state has sided with the winning candidate in the past 11 presidential elections. The same could be said of Lake County \u2013 no other part of Ohio has clung so closely to the prevailing mood of the state in recent times.</p> <p>Heffner, a retired business owner, said that he experienced that prevailing mood radically shift in the Mentor neighbourhoods he canvasses on the morning after the first presidential debate on 3 October. \"I felt strongly that night that Romney had performed great, but I didn't have any sense of how it would play on the street. But when I went knocking on doors I was amazed \u2013 people said to me 'I'm so glad to see you!' which believe me, I'm not used to hearing when I go out talking about politics.\"</p> <p>For this third and final presidential debate, Heffner was attending a \"victory watch party\" at the Romney field office in Mentor \u2013 one of about 40 field offices the Romney campaign has set up across this vital swing state. The office is a converted shop front in a strip of burger bars and diners towards the middle of town and as you enter it you are greeted by a full-sized cardboard cut-out of Romney standing under an image of the Republican mascot, an elephant.</p> <p>The room was full with about 30 Romney volunteers making phone calls to undecided voters. As 9pm came around, they dutifully downed tools and sat watching the debate, respectfully and largely in silence, though the discussion was punctuated by occasional outbursts of cheering and, when it came to Obama, derisive guffaws.</p> <p>The lustiest cheer of the night had nothing to do with the debate's theme, foreign policy, but came in response to Romney's routine promise to repeal Obamacare. Another big round of applause followed the Republican candidate's invocation of Obama's comment to the Russian president Dmitri Medvedev that he would have \"more flexibility\" on contentious issues after the US presidential election.</p> <p>Obama's boast that America was \"stronger now than when I came into office\" received a collective outburst of laughter. When the president made his most scathing comment of the night, ridiculing Romney for saying there were fewer ships in the US navy today than in 1917 by pointing out that \"we also have fewer horses and bayonets\", there were groans of disapproval around the room and even some mutterings of \"shut up!\" under muted breath.</p> <p>\"I didn't like that,\" Heffner said after the debate had ended, referring to the horses and bayonets remark. \"That kind of response is sophomoric to me \u2013 I think it sounds unpresidential.\"</p> <p>Jenny Best, 46, who was also at the watch party, didn't like the horses and bayonets line either. She's been volunteering for Romney since April, loyally turning up at the office with her entire family every Monday evening to hit the phones for two hours to persuadable voters.</p> <p>There's been a lot of talk about women voters this cycle, with more female voters still undecided than male. But Best has no hesitation about how she will vote, nor any qualms about the policy positions held by her candidate.</p> <p>She's pro-life, she says, so Romney's threat to cut back on Planned Parenthood is no issue for her. And that \"binders full of women\" sensation? \"I thought it was just great that he took the trouble to find successful women for his [Massachusetts] cabinet.\"</p> <p>Best thought Romney did a \"fabulous job\" over the Middle East, education, gender equality and his five-point plan for the economy. She was a bit hazy over the finer details of the foreign policy disagreements, apologising that \"I'm not familiar with a lot of that, that's my own weakness.\"</p> <p>Which was perhaps the most telling reaction of the night. The third debate may when we get to see the polls have relatively little impact because its content was for many Americans outside their immediate focus of concern \u2013 jobs.</p> <p>\"I don't think it will play that much when I go out knocking on doors tomorrow,\" Heffner said. \"Israel, Iran, whatever \u2013 those issues are important, sure, but try talking about them on the doorstep to someone who's lost his job.\"</p>",
  "<p>The president of Uruguay, Jos\u00e9 Mujica, has announced plans to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/22/relaxation-cannabis-laws-war-on-drugs\" title=\"\">legalise the production and sale of marijuana</a> under a state monopoly, triggering a lively controversy in Montevideo. The relevant bill will soon be tabled in parliament, where the governing centre-left coalition led by the Broad Front (FA) enjoys a majority but is divided on this issue.</p> <p>Possessing and consuming marijuana was decriminalised in 2000. \"There is no question of Uruguay producing and distributing drugs, but the state will control and regulate the market,\" said interior minister Eduardo Bonomi.</p> <p>\"We have a progressive tradition,\" said Bonomi who, with Mujica, belonged to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/oct/25/jose-mujica-favourite-uruguay-election\" title=\"\">Tupamaros urban guerrillas</a> in the 1970s. \"At the beginning of the 20th century our country ended the prohibition of alcohol, prostitution and gambling.\" Abortion is currently in the process ofbeing legalised. \"Our approach to marijuana is equally pragmatic,\" Bonomi said. \"The negative effects of consuming marijuana are far less harmful than the outbreak of violence associated with the black market.\"</p> <p>About 300,000 people (8% of the population) occasionally consume the drug. But the domestic market, currently illegal, is worth about $75m, according to the minister. \"The main hazard is not marijuana but the dealers who supply much more dangerous substances such as <em>paco</em> [a low-grade cocaine base], which does terrible damage.\"</p> <p>The government has not made it clear how production will be managed. Mujica has suggested that 150 hectares of land would be sufficient to cover demand, with distribution being entrusted to a \"private company\" under strict state control.</p> <p>The opposition is critical of the bill, arguing that it will boost drug use without reducing insecurity. Bonomi admits that crime is steadily increasing in Uruguay, but stresses that \"it is much lower than neighbouring countries such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/brazil\" title=\"\">Brazil</a> or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/argentina\" title=\"\">Argentina.</a>\"</p> <p>Insecurity is a prime concern for Uruguayans and a main cause of criticism of the president, whose approval ratings have fallen from 66% in 2004 when elected to 40%, according to a recent poll. However, three former Latin American presidents \u2013 Fernando Henrique Cardoso, C\u00e9sar Gaviria and Ernesto Zedillo, respectively of Brazil, Colombia and Mexico \u2013 have called for governments to take control of drugs. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/guatemala\" title=\"\">Guatemala</a> is in favour of the Mujica plan, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/bolivia\" title=\"\">Bolivia</a> is looking at ways of legalising coca leaves.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>This article appeared in </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/weekly?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Guardian Weekly</a><em>, which incorporates material from Le Monde</em></p>",

Last night it was Barack Obama's turn to produce the presidential debate's defining meme.</p> <p>In response to Mitt Romney's criticism that the US navy now has fewer ships than in 1916, the president told the Republican challenger: \"Well, governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military's changed. \"</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-news-blog/2012/oct/23/horses-and-bayonets-presidential-debate\" title=\"\">Twitter erupted, Tumblrs and Facebook groups were spawned</a>, and a slew of Google searches followed. It was chalked up as a zinger for Obama, the stand-out punch of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/23/third-presidential-debate-obama-wins?intcmp=122\" title=\"\">a conclusive debate victory</a>. But, as Republican critics have been quick to point out, the bayonet isn't quite so obsolete as you might expect.</p> <p>In fact, from its origins in 17th-century France, as little more than a blade shoved into the barrel of a musket, it has had <a href=\"http://www.h2g2.com/approved_entry/A847532\" title=\"\">an illustrious military career</a>. First used by British troops at the Battle of Killiecrankie in 1689, we took them to South Africa to defeat the Zulu Impi, used them to terrorise our foes in both world wars, and continue to arm our soldiers with them to this day.</p> <p>As, unfortunately for Obama's zinger, do Americans. The US Marines \u2013 who, as of 2003, carry the OKC-3S model bayonet \u2013 even complete a <a href=\"http://www.marines.com/becoming-a-marine/recruit-training/-/twelve-weeks/slide/4\" title=\"\">bayonet assault course</a> as part of their basic training. The army, by contrast, still issues troops with an M9 bayonet knife, but <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-201_162-6303184.html\" title=\"\">has scaled back its bayonet drills</a> since early 2010, in part to focus on soldiers' fitness, and because the last bayonet charge by US troops took place in Korea, back in 1951.</p> <p>We Brits, on the other hand, are still mad for them. British troops have deployed the trusty bayonet charge in the <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1407233/Last-charge-for-the-bayonet-a-victim-of-modern-warfare.html\" title=\"\">Falklands</a>, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8016685.stm\" title=\"\">Iraq</a> and <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8252974.stm\" title=\"\">Afghanistan</a>, as recently as October of last year, when 25-year-old Corporal Sean Jones of the Princess of Wales's Regiment earned the Military Cross for ordering his ambushed troops to fix bayonets and <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/9571522/Soldier-who-led-Afghanistan-bayonet-charge-into-hail-of-bullets-honoured.html\" title=\"\">charge headlong across a field</a> at their attackers.</p> <p>The claim that the US has fewer bayonets now may be a dubious one, but that doesn't make Romney's comments any less daft. Yes, they have fewer ships than they did in 1916, but again the UK provides an enlightening comparison. In our last <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2010/oct/19/defence-review-cuts-list\" title=\"\">defence spending review</a>, navy chiefs are reported to have <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/defence/8049674/Navy-to-reduce-to-smallest-size-ever-to-save-carriers.html\" title=\"\">offered to reduce our fleet to just 12 surface ships</a>, less than a third of the number we had under Henry VIII.

  "<p>Mitt Romney is not particularly new to gaffes but when it comes to one about the relationship between Syria and Iran, he has shown extraordinary courage in repeating it at least six times just in the past year.</p> <p>During last night's foreign policy debate, Romney <a href=\"http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2012/10/22/172264/full-transcript-of-the-presidential.html\">said</a>: \"Syria is Iran's only ally in the Arab world. It's their route to the sea.\"</p> <p>In fact, Iran, a close ally of Bashar al-Assad's regime, has direct access to international waters through its large coastline on the Gulf and is not even a neighbour to Syria in order to rely on it as a route to the sea. </p> <p>Instead, Syria gives Iran a physical access to Lebanon and its Hezbollah militia which is strategically important for Tehran leaders because of the group's geographical position in respect to Israel. </p> <p>It is not the first time that governor Romney has referred to Syria as a country that provides Iran with a route to the sea.</p> <p>In March, Romney made the exact gaffe at AIPAC conference. </p> <p>\"Maybe one of the few bright spots in the Middle East developments in the last year has been the rising of the people in Syria against Assad. Obviously, as you know, Syria is Iran's only Arab ally in the region. Syria is the route that allows Iran to supply Hezbollah with weapons in Lebanon. Syria is Iran's route to the sea,\" he said, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/fact-checker/post/romney-and-irans-route-to-the-sea/2012/04/18/gIQAgTbXRT_blog.html\">according to the Washington Post</a>, which fact-checked his remarks back then. </p> <p>The US presidential candidate has also previously repeated the reference including in a CNN presidential primary debate in Arizona in February. \"Syria is their key ally.

However, many Iranians are watching it anxiously amid fears that a victory by Mitt Romney could significantly increases the possibility of an Israeli military strike against the regime's nuclear facilities.</p> <p>Romney is viewed in the Islamic republic as more sympathetic to the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, and his \"red lines\" over Tehran's nuclear activities than Barack Obama. </p> <p>Iranian state agencies are reporting the developments of Obama-Romney campaigns but with little commentary. </p> <p>Iranian officials, however, have tried to conceal the concerns, claiming that the country would be immune regardless of the results.</p> <p>President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, speaking among reporters in New York during a visit to the UN general assembly in September, refused to show support to either candidates. </p> <p>\"We do believe that the US elections are a domestic issue and we will not get in the middle of that at all,\" he responded to a journalist's question, according to an account of the meeting on the website of the Foreign Policy magazine. \"I believe the people of the US are not a war-seeking people.\"</p> <p>Speaker of the Iranian parliament, Ali Larijani, said a Romney win would not be a threat. In Larinaji's view, the governor's support for Israel's possible attack amounted to little more than campaign rhetoric. </p> <p>\"It is political systems in the US which make decisions, not individuals,\" he told the FT in an interview in September. \"Mr Obama swept to power and made promises which were not followed by actions. So, I do not think significant changes can happen.\"</p>",
  "<p>In their third and final debate Romney and Obama sat down <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/22/final-debate-obama-romney-live\">to argue over the nation's foreign policy</a>. Sabers were rattled, chests were beaten and both candidates fell over themselves to pander to the citizens of the Greatest Nation On Earth As Pre-ordained By God. </p> <p>And once that was over, Mitt Romney mostly said he would have done the same as Barack Obama on Egypt, Libya, Iran.

It's a silent one. And they're winning.\"</p> <p>\"We have to say to our friend in China&#xa0;\u2026 you can't keep on holding down the value of your currency, stealing our intellectual property, counterfeiting our products, selling them around the world, even to the United States.\"</p> <p>The US has not labelled China a currency manipulator since 1994, though successive administrations have considered doing so. Some observers doubt whether Romney would actually follow through.</p> <p>Zhiwu Chen, professor of finance at the Yale School of Management, noted on his widely followed Sina Weibo account: \"Romney can say anything before he becomes the president, but it may not count.\"</p> <p>The value of the renminbi against the dollar has risen by around 11% \u2013 when adjusted for inflation \u2013 since Barack Obama took office. The economist Paul Krugman, who has repeatedly called for pressure on China over the renminbi in the past, described its valuation as \"<a href=\"http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/22/an-issue-whose-time-has-passed/\" title=\"\">an issue whose time has passed</a>\" in a blogpost on Monday.</p> <p>Labelling China a currency manipulator would be a largely symbolic move \u2013 requiring only negotiations between the countries \u2013 and Romney has not committed himself to following up with concrete measures such as imposing tariffs.</p> <p>\"That might provoke a reaction. Simply saying it was a manipulator would draw an angry reaction from the press but I don't see it would [necessarily] have much more impact than that,\" said Alistair Thornton, senior China economist at IHS Global Insight.</p> <p>Richard Bush III of the Brookings Institution wrote this week that the <a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/blogs/up-front/posts/2012/10/22-romney-china-bush\" title=\"\">worst-case scenario was a trade war</a> slowing growth and raising unemployment in both countries and raising inflation and interest rates in the US.</p> <p>But he said that was unlikely since China would probably claim the existing strategic and economic dialogue fulfilled the need for negotiations. Even if Romney wished to go further, he would need congressional approval \u2013 and the business lobby would most likely strongly oppose measures such as tariffs.</p> <p>\"China could also impose some kind of tariff on US products as a way of fighting back. The US and China would end up in a lose-lose situation,\" said Gary Liu, the executive deputy director of the CEIBS Lujiazui Institute of International Finance.</p> <p>He argued that the rebalancing of the Chinese economy away from investment and exports and towards consumption, which has long been advocated by its leaders but slow in coming, would be good news for the US and should improve relations.</p> <p>According to figures released this summer by Pew Research, the proportion of people saying they are paying close attention to the presidential race is far lower than in 2008 in most countries \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.pewglobal.org/files/2012/06/Pew-Global-Attitudes-U.S.-Image-Report-FINAL-June-13-2012.pdf\" title=\"\">but has more than doubled in China</a> (pdf) to 36%.</p> <p>The debate itself, viewable live on the internet but not broadcast by Chinese TV channels, was never likely to notch up a sizable audience in China given that it took place during working hours.

The US has had occasional meetings with Iranian officials alongside multilateral talks but the Iranians, hamstrung by deep internal divisions in Tehran, have shied away from such public encounters over the past three years.</p> <p>During Monday night's debate in Florida, two weeks before what is expected to be a close election, Obama dismissed <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/21/world/iran-said-ready-to-talk-to-us-about-nuclear-program.html?hp&amp;_r=0\" title=\"\">a New York Times</a> report over the weekend that the US and Iran were exploring the possibility of holding direct bilateral nuclear negotiations after the election. But a few minutes later, he appeared to contradict himself, in what was possibly an unguarded remark made out of irritation that Romney had taken to echoing many of his administration's policies and presenting them as his own.</p> <p>\"I'm pleased that you now are endorsing our policy of applying diplomatic pressure and potentially having bilateral discussions with the Iranians to end their nuclear programme,\" he said, although Romney had made no mention of such discussions.</p> <p>While the White House has rejected the New York Times report, it has not specifically denied that American and Iranian officials have been holding secret meetings in parallel to the public multilateral negotiations, since soon after Obama came to office in 2009.</p> <p>Mark Fitzpatrick, a former state department expert on proliferation at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said: \"I have been hearing for some time that they had been having private discussions, and now it is starting to become public.\"</p> <p>Western officials say that within a few weeks of the US election, a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/11/diplomatic-defusing-iranian-nuclear-crisis\" title=\"\">new round of talks </a>are expected between the six powers and Iran at which the offer put on the table in return for curbs on Iran's uranium enrichment would be \"reformulated\".</p> <p>The six powers (US, UK, France, Russia, China and Germany) will make it clearer to Iran that relief from the current severe sanctions regime will be available if Iran stops producing 20%-enriched uranium \u2013 a particular proliferation concern as it could easily turned into weapons-grade uranium should Iran take the decision to make a bomb.</p> <p>US officials have said they expect that meeting to go ahead, but President Obama signalled on Monday night it could be a springboard to a new bilateral negotiating track to run separately or in tandem with the broader talks.</p> <p>\"There will be a new round of talks before the end of November, and I think what the Iranians have agreed to is to meet bilaterally with US officials at the margins of those talks,\" Fitzpatrick said.</p> <p>\"Ultimately, this is something that has to be resolved between the US and Iran. They are the two main protagonists. Whatever they agree to, the others will go along with.\"</p> <p>The prospect of a new phase in the negotiations possibly opens up a significant difference in outcomes in foreign policy as a result of the 6 November elections, where otherwise the differences are relatively minor.</p> <p>It is not at all clear whether Romney would enter such talks without a full policy review, and his close relationship with the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, suggests he would pay more heed to Israeli reservations about such negotiations, which are likely, if successful, to leave Iran with a limited right to uranium enrichment. It is also far from assured that, if presented with such an opportunity, Iran's elderly and infirm supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, would have the confidence to embrace it.</p>",

Both agreed then it was time to act.</p> <p>But this year's vice-presidential contenders, Joe Biden and Paul Ryan, also failed to mention climate change during their single encounter, making for a total of six hours of primetime television debate without a single reference to climate change.</p> <p>The omission \u2013 or \"climate silence\" \u2013 has proved hugely frustrating to campaigners.</p> <p>It spawned <a href=\"http://climatesilence.org/\" title=\"\">a website</a> which urged Obama and Romney to give climate change <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/10/uselections2008.hansen\" title=\"\">the attention it had in the 2008 election</a> and a petition drive before the first debate, which gathered 160,000 signatures demanding debate moderators put climate on the agenda.</p> <p>The two candidates did engage in a heated back-and-forth about gas prices in their town hall encounter last week. But the exchange saw Obama trying to one-up Romney in his support for oil and coal \u2013 fossil fuels rather than renewable sources of power.</p> <p>CNN's Candy Crowley, the debate moderator, <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2012/10/17/presidential_debate_candy_crowley_almost_asked_a_question_for_you_climate.html\" title=\"\">later told Slate</a> there had been questions from the audience about climate change, but she thought the economy was the priority.</p> <p>\"Climate change, I had that question,\" she was quoted as saying. \"All you climate change people.

Al Gore weighed in, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/algore/status/260565096445644800\" title=\"\">tweeting during the course of the debate</a>: \"Where is global warming in this debate? Climate change is an urgent foreign policy issue.\"</p> <p>The Green party's presidential candidate, Jill Stein, went so far as to label Obama a climate change denier <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/oct/22/us-elections-barack-obama-climate-denial\" title=\"\">in an interview with the Guardian</a> for his failure to discuss the issue on the campaign trail.</p> <p>Other commentators argued allowances should be made for Obama's failure to discuss climate on the campaign trail, and his middling support for environmental concerns while in the White House.</p> <p>Since the rise of the Tea Party conservatives in 2010, energy and climate change have emerged as among the most contentious issues dividing Republicans and Democrats.</p> <p>The backlash from anti-government conservatives led Obama to downplay his green agenda, delaying and weakening environmental regulations. It also led to the adoption of what Obama called an \"all of the above\" energy strategy, which saw a role for expanded offshore oil drilling and domestic production, due to new techniques in hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/mar/22/keystone-xl-obama-fast-track-southern\" title=\"\">Obama also moved to fast-track the southern portion of the Keystone XL pipeline</a>, which will help step up Alberta's huge tar sands production.</p> <p>Administration officials, including Obama, began to avoid the very mention of climate change threats, opting instead to frame the issue in terms of the economic opportunities created by clean energy industries such as solar and wind power.</p> <p>Romney, meanwhile, responded to the rise of the Tea Party by backtracking on his earlier support for climate action as governor of Massachusetts. He also called for phasing out <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/blog/2012/oct/17/us-wind-power-mitt-romney-subsidy\" title=\"\">subsidies for the wind industry</a>.</p> <p>By the time of the Republican convention, Romney was using climate change as a laugh line, a way of tagging Obama with grandiosity for his 2008 election promise to help heal the planet.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/07/barack-obama-mitt-romney-climate\" title=\"\">Obama hit back in his convention speech</a>, pledging to reduce the emissions which cause global warming. \"Climate change is not a hoax,\" he said. \"More droughts and floods and wildfires are not a joke. They are a threat to our children's future. And in this election you can do something about it.\"</p> <p>As a number of commentators noted at the time, it was Obama's most high-profile mention of climate change in months, if not years.</p> <p>Even so, the novelist <a href=\"http://90days90reasons.com/27.php\" title=\"\">Jonathan Franzen argued</a> that Obama \u2013 while a disappointment to campaigners \u2013 was still a better option on the environment than Romney.</p> <p>\"So give Obama a C-plus or even just a C on the environment if you like,\" Franzen wrote on the <a href=\"http://90days90reasons.com/index.php\" title=\"\">90 Days, 90 Reasons</a> blog.</p> <p>\"But consider that Mitt Romney, if he's elected, will nullify soundly based decisions by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA); he will continue to pretend that the science of climate change is uncertain; he will open up all federal lands (except, presumably, national parks) to the ravages of drilling and mining; he will roll back sensible regulation of pollution and habitat destruction; and he has shown, with his choice of Paul Ryan as a running mate, that he is serious about slashing funding for every federal program except the military \u2013 and you'd better believe that the EPA and Fish and Wildlife will be the first to be gutted. Mitt Romney will get an F, double-underlined in red ink.\"</p>",
  "<p>At the very start of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/23/third-presidential-debate-obama-wins\" title=\"\">third presidential debate</a>, the first exchange of, admittedly fairly soft, blows between President Obama and Mitt Romney came over al-Qaida, and a very specific question: is the group responsible for the 9/11 attacks stronger than four years ago?</p> <p>For Romney the answer was, more or less, clear: \"Is al-Qaida on the run, on its heels? No.\"</p> <p>For Obama, \"al-Qaida is much weaker than it was when I came into office, and they don't have the same capacities to attack the US homeland and our allies as they did four years ago\".</p> <p>Both men tried to establish a definition of al-Qaida that suited them. For Romney, al-Qaida was sometimes the organisation founded by Osama bin Laden and others in 1988, sometimes all those now influenced by its ideology. So he referred to both \"this radical violent extremism which is \u2026 really not on the run\" and to an apparently single \"group that is now involved in 10 or 12 countries\" which \"presents an enormous threat\".</p> <p>Obama preferred to keep to a more narrow definition of al-Qaida \u2013 perhaps natural for the man who ordered the operation that killed Bin Laden and for whom any broader surge in extremism would, especially after the death of the US ambassador to Libya in Benghazi, be an indictment of his record.</p> <p>For the president, al-Qaida meant the senior leadership of the group, based mainly in Pakistan.</p> <p>Obama's claim that the hardcore leadership of al-Qaida has been decimated is fair. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/08/al-quaida-future-islamic-militants\" title=\"\">Senior British intelligence officials talk of the upper and even middle ranks of the organisation being \"hollowed out\"</a>. Their US, European and Middle Eastern counterparts largely concur: almost all the main players of a decade ago are dead or detained.</p> <p>The use of drones by Obama has had a huge impact, as has the death of Bin Laden. The broad consensus among analysts is that a threat from \"hardcore al-Qaida\" still remains but it is less serious than in 2008 \u2013 and very much less serious than it was in 2004 or 2005. There was no credible threat detected to the London Olympics, for example, something that would have seemed extraordinary only a short time ago.</p> <p>One element that influences the debate in the US is that it is the only western nation that has seen increased levels of militant activity, homegrown and otherwise, over recent years. Though most attackers have shown dubious commitment and limited competence there have been important exceptions.</p> <p>As for the geographic spread, Romney's claim that there is a single group \"now involved in 10 or 12 countries\" fails on an important technicality. There are violent extremist Islamic groups \u2013 plural \u2013 involved in, at the very least, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq, the Yemen, Jordan, Syria, Somalia, Mali, Nigeria, Egypt, Algeria, Iraq, India, Indonesia and other places too. But the relationship of these groups to \"al-Qaida\" varies dramatically. Many reject any association at all.</p> <p>Romney's use of the term \"al-Qaida-like types\", a new addition to the counter-terrorist lexicon, to describe militants in Mali seemed a welcome acknowledgement of the fragmented nature of contemporary Islamic militancy in the Sahel and elsewhere but he soon reverted to \"al-Qaida\" running Mali however.</p> <p>Elsewhere he spoke of \"jihadi groups\" rushing in. An irrepressible tendency to aggregate? A genuine failure to understand the phenomenon? Either way, the fair point that violent Islamic militancy, some linked to the late Bin Laden's group, has not gone away was partly lost in the confusion.</p> <p>But how much of a threat does that disparate and fragmented phenomenon pose? It is difficult to judge, as Romney rightly admitted. Geographic spread is a crude measure. If groups have emerged in parts of north Africa and elsewhere as new opportunities have emerged in the wake of the Arab uprisings, they have also disappeared elsewhere \u2013 in Saudi Arabia and, to a great extent, in Indonesia, for example.</p> <p>A militant in remote Mali is significantly less worrying then one in, say, Syria or Jordan. You could have found militants in a dozen countries back in the 1990s.</p> <p>Overall, it seems difficult to substantiate the claim that Islamic militancy is still \"very very strong\". Globally, polls and anecdotal evidence indicate that despite the \"tumult\" in the Middle East radical militancy remains attractive only to a negligible number and that popular support is still almost totally lacking outside very limited areas, and is pretty thin there too.</p> <p>Al-Qaida can recruit enough people and get enough resources to survive but few security services or analysts outside government see radical Islam generally as an existential threat in the way many did in the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks or the bombings in Madrid or London of 2004 and 2005.</p> <p>Whether or not Obama can take as much credit as he would like for this, is another matter. The decline of the threat posed by radical violence may owe something to the tone and look he brought in 2008 and to policies pursued subsequently. It is also due to much more effective counter-terrorist capacity built up over a decade or more, however. Democracy, education, gender equality and free markets were all mentioned as weapons against extremism in the debate.</p> <p>But to a great extent the continuing weakness, and tenacity, of violent extremism today is due to local factors, particularly the revulsion of communities across the Islamic world for violence when it occurs close at hand.</p>",
  "<p>I took a press trip round Jordan with a group of mostly evangelical Christian writers from the US last month. I had visited before, with a largely Catholic and Anabaptist group, who had seen their visit as a learning pilgrimage. This time was very different. I hoped that once our gracious host gently illuminated Jordanian customs and traditions, they would adapt accordingly. But after she explained why we should not photograph women in burqas without their permission and someone responded, \"but those are the pictures we want\", I knew I would be in for an ongoing demonstration of American exceptionalism in action.</p> <p>After a few in our group witnessed to our bus driver and someone even tried to convert me, I realised that once again, the evangelicals are coming after my apophatic soul. Those of us who do not subscribe to the \"Jesus said it, I believe it, that settles it\" mindset continue to be targeted. The roots of these attacks can be traced back to the 17th century Puritans who proclaimed Massachusetts Bay Colony as a City on a Hill, a nation particularly blessed by God. My direct ancestor <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Williams_%28theologian%29\" title=\"\">Roger Williams</a> countered this argument by proclaiming liberty of conscience, the idea that one's soul must be free from any state interference.</p> <p>Also, in lieu of seizing the natives' land and trying to convert them over to his version of God, Williams negotiated fair treaties for their property and learned their language so he could work alongside them. As expected, he got banned from godly Massachusetts by those Puritans whose motto should read \"religious liberty for me but not for thee\" to say nothing of their disdain for the local tribes, whom they viewed as subhuman savages.</p> <p>The modern-day Puritans I encountered in Jordan acted like they were visiting a religious Disneyland-style theme park. Their objectives appeared to be sampling their version of the holy land experience while racking up conversions. For example, a member of our party who donned sleeveless tank tops, bought Muslim headgear intended for Sunday school show-and-tell demonstrations and talked about Jesus at every opportunity appeared oblivious that her actions were viewed as a sign of disrespect by the Muslims she encountered.</p> <p>In an interview I conducted with Father Nabil Haddad, executive director of the <a href=\"http://www.coexistencejordan.org\" title=\"\">Jordanian Inter-Faith Coexistence Research Centre</a>, he discussed the need to find the common ground between the local culture and the international human rights culture. But for us to get to the core of what we have in common via our shared humanity requires deep listening instead of the incessant evangelical chatter that I encountered not only throughout my trip but during this 2012 US presidential election cycle as well.</p> <p>Romney possesses the breeding not to commit some of the additional faux pas I observed such as exposing the soles of his feet or asking a Bedouin man what he is wearing under his white tunic. But he can only get elected with the votes of people like my companions in Jordan, and he will worry more about pleasing them than offending the rest of the world.</p>",
  "<p>With just a few more campaigning days left before the elections for the new police and crime commissioners electionson 15 November, all the candidates will soon be officially declared, following a late flurry of people stepping in and stepping out of the contests. Members of the voting public now will have an opportunity to check out the campaign websites of the contenders.</p> <p>Much will now depend on who is elected. The predicted low turnout and the innovation of supplementary votingin areas that have never used such a system mean almost any variety of results is possible.</p> <p>The new PCCs may be destined to fade from public view like their predecessor police authorities as they become submerged by the scale of the responsibilities they will solely have. They may begin to tackle some elements of police culture that the Hillsborough report is now uncovering; they may herald in a new era of outsourced policing where dual-motif epaulets become the norm rather than the exception.</p> <p>Perhaps chief constables, who will remain in operational command, will calmly remain the professional face of local police services and allow the PCCs only tightly scripted walk-on parts \u2013 or perhaps these new super-politicians will stride across the criminal justice landscape, leaving huge change in their wake. It is not yet clear what will happen. But before the elections themselves, here are six more sets of pertinent questions for the PCC candidates:</p> <p>1. The new PCCs will have <a href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/+/http:/www.homeoffice.gov.uk/police/police-crime-commissioners/questions/pcc-powers/\" title=\"\">several significant new powers</a> including appointing and dismissing their chief constable, setting the local council tax precept for policing and determining local policing priorities and plan. Does the candidate's website mention their various powers and how they will exercise them? What is their policy on raising precepts and does this conform to current, three-year policing budgets? Are words such as precept, budget or priorities even present? How will reductions in government grants be managed by the PCC?</p> <p>2. There has been much talk about the policing side of these new positions but far less discussion about the PCCs' extensive (and possibly growing) responsibilities in areas beyond crime itself. Does the candidate's website allude to these responsibilities? What is their approach to joined-up partnership working across the criminal justice system beyond the platitudinous? Will they be a good leader who will build strong bridges?</p> <p>3. The Olympics and the west coast trainline fiasco has brought the whole subject of outsourcing and privatisation to the fore. Does the candidate's website mention the outsourcing plans implemented by Lincolnshire police and considered by West Midlands &amp; Surrey police forces? Is there a clear policy stand taken by the candidate? By what principles will they judge whether various forms and scales of outsourcing are in the public interest or not?</p> <p>4. There are has been little talk of what kind of \"office\" the new PCC will need to have and few candidates so far have outlined what kind of team they will assemble. Some have declared that they will have a deputy, others have not. Does the candidate's website give any indication of how much public money will be spent by the PCC on her/his office and sundry expenses? If so, how much? What does the budget cover?</p> <p>5. Many candidates have made much of their capability to be the PCC for their area. Does the candidate's website give accessible links for people to find out more about their work or political record? Or are the voters expected to take the credentials of the candidate on trust?</p> <p>6. Public accountability and representing the voice of the people is often cited by the government as the main reason for this change. The idea is that local people can have more of a direct say in how their police services are delivered. This will only work if the PCC is able to listen to, analyse and act upon the concerns and priorities of all the communities in their area. Does the candidate's website describe how they will do this in specific terms? What plans and practices are outlined which will lead to the candidate developing a close understanding of their \"patch\" and the people there? How will the candidates allow themselves to be held to account by the people in between this and the next election in May 2016? And does their website explain transparently how their campaign has been funded and any connections or interests that they wish to declare?</p> <p><em>Jon Harvey is a leadership and organisational development practitioner, a town councillor in Buckingham and was shortlisted to be the Labour candidate for the Thames Valley PCC. </em></p> <p><em>\u2022 To respond to this, or any other article on the Public Leaders Network, email public.leaders@guardian.co.uk.

  "<p>With the final debate between Obama and Romney in the 2012 US presidential election campaign behind us, we can expect another inevitable onslaught of debate analysis, opinion polls, extreme scrutiny and hilarious Twitter hashtags. So I'd feel remiss if I didn't add to this. </p> <p>This wealth of data arguably is a good thing: it suggests that there is a demand for it, and this in turn suggests a large number of people are actively interested in the politics that directly affects their lives. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/voterapathy\">Voter apathy</a> is often a concern (in UK politics at least), so anything that gets people interested should be encouraged.</p> <p>However, so much analysis, discussion, dissection, interpretation and opinion is produced over every debate or other high-profile (<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-19631430\">or not</a>) political event, it risks becoming largely meaningless. I'm not in charge of a global superpower (yet) so I can't say for certain, but I'd have guessed that articulately defending your policies in front of an audience (albeit a <a href=\"http://www.alternet.org/election-2012/audience-60-million-watched-presidential-disaster\">very large one</a>) is not the most important facet of the job. </p> <p>And yet, the debates are portrayed as a crucial test of candidate suitability. The actions of animals in <a href=\"http://jab.sagepub.com/\">behavioural science</a> labs don't come under this much scrutiny. When every sentence, gesture and stance (physical and ideological) can potentially result in a level of meticulous analysis that <a href=\"http://www.jic.ac.uk/microscopy/intro_em.html\">an electron microscope</a> would consider \"a bit invasive\", what chance does any normal human have of getting an honest and accurate assessment of the useful facts in order to make a rational decision? I'd argue that it's \"very little\", bordering on \"zero\". They're likely to end up filtering the data in some way, and focussing on things that conform to their own views and principles, and if such a <a href=\"http://www.sciencedaily.com/articles/c/confirmation_bias.htm\">confirmation bias</a> is used (by necessity) can a balanced decision based on the facts really be likely?</p> <p>This is undoubtedly going to get worse as time and technology progress. It's bad enough now with 24-hour news channels and the internet with all its inlets and outlets. Most media, seemingly terrified of the audience's attention wavering, focus on sound bites and brief clips, which risk losing the context and nuance of a 3-hour debate. Twitter is hardly any better in this regard. </p> <p>Who knows how bad it's going to get when more advanced technology becomes available? One can imagine the depth of analysis we'll have to deal with for the 2020 election debates.</p> <p>\"At the 2 hour mark, the perspiration detection laser sweep revealed the Democratic candidate has 1.54 times the number of beads of sweat on his forehead than his rival, implying that he is over 50% more nervous than the opposition candidate when discussing the economy. However, when the Republican candidate belched at 94 minutes, the olfactory detection scanner in the podium revealed that he had recently eaten bacon, which is likely to lose him support among undecided Jewish voters.\"</p> <p>As facetious as this may sound, the reasons people actually vote for who they do can often be no more sophisticated and superficial. In a way, it's something of a contradiction to actively decide who will make decisions for you. Democracy is a relatively recent occurrence in terms of <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/317/5843/1360.full\">human cognitive evolution</a>. If we're not adapted to make logical decisions based on the extensive socio-economic factors and variables we're presented with, how do we decide who we want in charge?</p> <p>Because humans do seem to always want someone in charge. Humans (and other primates) are social creatures and instinctively form <a href=\"http://anthro.palomar.edu/behavior/behave_2.htm\">groups with a hierarchical structure</a>. The need for hierarchies and social standing are potentially <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2430590/\">hard</a> <a href=\"http://www.nih.gov/news/health/apr2008/nimh-23.htm\">wired</a> into our brains, and our position in the hierarchy can <a href=\"http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdf/10.2105/AJPH.94.1.82\">affect our health and well being</a>. And with any hierarchy, there is inevitably someone at the top.</p> <p>For more primitive societies, the leader is likely to be the one who can control most others by being the biggest or strongest, the one you <a href=\"http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-an-alpha-male.htm\">don't want to cross.</a> But as any society gets more widespread and complex, so must the mechanisms to control the society by its leader. Religion undoubtedly played a part in this, making it possible to invoke an invisible deity who will punish those who break the social rules when nobody is around, via some ineffable methods. And anyone who can claim to represent the deity must be obeyed, for they are supposedly capable of things beyond you. </p> <p>In such tightly regulated hierarchies as religions and militaries, who ends up in charge is not a democratic decision; in these cases, membership of and acceptance by the organisation usually requires discipline and strict adherence to the rules, so who gets to lead is not a matter for debate.</p> <p>The sort of free-thinking, intellectual types who read the Guardian science section may think themselves above such mindless adherence to authority figures, but that sadly may not be the case, even for more \"enlightened\" types. <a href=\"http://www.stanleymilgram.com/pdf/attribution.pdf\">Milgram's infamous experiment</a>, where everyday volunteers from normal backgrounds told to supply painful (but simulated, although they didn't know that) electric shocks to an unwilling victim, actually did so if commanded by a recognised authority figure (in this case, a scientist). </p> <p>One theory as to why this happens is that the subjects enter an \"<a href=\"http://aspsychology101.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/1-6-agency-theory.pdf\">agentic state</a>\", where they feel responsibility for their actions rests with the authority figure, not them, no matter how distressing. This is one theorised mechanism for why people obey commands that lead to genocide.</p> <p>But it's not a straightforward process. Give someone a uniform and a position of authority and they don't instantly get respect and obedience, as any traffic warden will tell you.</p> <p>Context appears to play a crucial role in the designation of someone as a 'good leader'. For example, <a href=\"http://psychology.about.com/od/leadership/f/autocratic-leadership.htm\">authoritarian leaders</a> tend to do better at times of crisis, which is why the more right wing establishments tend to try to convince people that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/apr/12/war-on-terror-corrupting\">crises are ongoing</a>. During peaceful times, people tend to be more resentful at having their individual rights stripped from them when there's no imminent danger to justify this. </p> <p>Even on the minor level , context matters. Ministers trading criticisms of each other's records is usually dismissed as childish name calling. But <a href=\"http://gulfnews.com/news/world/australia/gillard-poll-boost-after-sexism-speech-1.1092609\">Julia Gillard's blistering attack on her opponent's sexism</a> has done her no end of good, politically.</p> <p>There is an extensive<a href=\"http://psgleadership.scripts.mit.edu/2012IAP/pdf/1_required_reading/Scientific views on Leadership.pdf\"> body of research</a> on the social and psychological factors that determine who and what makes a good leader. There are many conflicting theories, but <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Levels_of_Leadership_model\">one major one</a> mentions the importance of 'presence', that vague but essential quality that makes someone more likely to be obeyed and followed without objection. Exactly how you'd quantify this is anyone's guess.</p> <p>Social psychologist <a href=\"http://www.infed.org/thinkers/robert_freed_bales.htm\">Robert F Bales</a> posited two classes of leaders: task leaders (who excel at initiating and directing behaviour to get a job done) and socio-emotive leaders (who lift spirits and provide psychological well-being to a group). Seeing as politicians need to be elected in order to start directing behaviour and completing the jobs of governing, they invariably fall into the latter category. </p> <p>Whatever you think of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/oct/19/george-osborne-inspector-train-ticket\">George Osborne's fare dodging </a>or <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/9619433/Police-probe-Nick-Griffin-Twitter-rant-against-gay-BandB-couple.html\">Nick Griffin's alarming Twitter behaviour</a>, the fact remains that a significant number of people felt comfortable enough with them to elect them into office. Feel free to find this alarming, I know I do.</p> <p>It's worth pointing out that much of the leadership research cited in the literature is from a Western society perspective, and focuses on narrow areas such as business and small groups (both easily accessible to research). So any conclusions made may not be readily applicable to society in general, which is obviously far more complex and chaotic than any one group</p> <p>With so many variables in play, perhaps it is na\u00efve to expect any one politician to be able to effectively control and direct the extensive and ever-changing needs of a society of millions. Even religions recognise this, typically referring to an omnipotent deity who is running things. Monotheistic religions keep it vague with some omnipresent super being, but I prefer the Hindu approach, where they believe the world is run by thousands of gods, with about six arms each. Makes sense, India is a busy place after all.</p> <p>But modern politics essentially asks voters to consider all the potential ramifications of one individual or group of individuals being in charge of a society and all the variables and complications this entails. The human mind is unlikely to be able to do this without years of study in the area, so will inevitably revert to what it knows; deciding according to <a href=\"http://www.psychwiki.com/wiki/Group_Influence\">group influence</a>, personal ideology, even physical preference like <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/datablog/2011/oct/18/world-leader-heights-tall\">height</a>, <a href=\"http://www.princeton.edu/main/news/multimedia/player.xml?auto_play=true&amp;section=mm-featured&amp;videopath=/main/news/archive/S21/78/78M51/index.xml\">facial expressions</a> and <a href=\"http://www.wcffoundation.org/pages/research/women-in-politics-statistics.html\">gender</a> . </p> <p>You may argue that the latter isn't such a big deal, that you could probably<a href=\"http://bindersfullofwomen.tumblr.com/\"> fill binders </a>with the number of powerful women you can think of, but the sad fact is that positions of authority in numerous fields are still male-dominated. Perhaps men have been in charge for so long that most people see it as the norm now, and assume there must be a logical reason for it? Damned if I know what it is, though.</p> <p>So it's no wonder that, when confronted by a bombardment of facts and data that mean little or nothing about issues they can't really relate to, people will vote according to things they can grasp. Politicians know this, the media know this, which is maybe why so much time and effort is spent on seemingly irrelevant details like photo opportunities and correct phrasing; these are the things many people will relate to, and so could win an election. Ergo, they're not irrelevant after all.</p> <p>If we ever are visited by aliens and they utter the classic request \"Take me to your leader\", I hope they are the patient sort, because that's going to take some working out.</p> <p><em>Dean Burnett prefers to interact with his puny minions via the medium of Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/garwboy\">@garwboy</a></em></p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama went on the offensive over foreign policy in the third and final presidential debate, repeatedly accusing Mitt Romney of flip-flopping on major international issues but failing to deliver a killer blow to his opponent's resurgent campaign.</p> <p>While the president emerged as the narrow winner on the night, the encounter, which was cordial and largely uneventful compared with the previous two debates, is unlikely to have much impact on the outcome of the election. </p> <p>Going into the debate at Lynn University in Boca Raton, Florida, Obama had an inbuilt advantage on foreign policy and security. As president, with access to daily briefings by intelligence analysts, diplomats and generals, he is better briefed and it showed as he dominated Romney in the first half of the debate.</p>      <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-398201044\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/10/23/1350969767732/Third-US-presidential-deb-012.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/brightcove/2012/10/23/NowThisNewsDebate60secs-16x9.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/connectedTV/1280/2012/10/23/NowThisNewsDebate60secs-720.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2012/10/23/NowThisNewsDebate60secs_3gpLg16x9.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/ad/NowThisNewsDebate60secs/NowThisNewsDebate60secs.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2012/10/23/NowThisNewsDebate60secs_3gpSml16x9.3gp\"/> </video>   <p>The Republican candidate appeared unsure at times and occasionally stumbled over his lines as if struggling to remember his briefing notes. He began sweating as Obama, aggressive from the start, got the better of him during exchanges on Iran, Iraq and Russia as well as on US military spending. </p> <p>Obama described his opponent twice as \"wrong and reckless\" and accused him of being \"all over the map\" on his foreign policy positions. The president worked through a list of issues on which he said Romney had been wrong, from support for the 2003 Iraq invasion through to opposing setting a timetable for withdrawal from Afghanistan.</p> <p>\"What we need to do with respect to the Middle East is strong, steady leadership, not wrong and reckless leadership that is all over the map,\" said Obama. \"And unfortunately that's the kind of opinions that you've offered throughout this campaign, and it is not a recipe for American strength, or keeping America safe over the long haul.\"</p> <p>But with a growing sense in the Republican camp that the White House might just be within reach after all, Romney appeared happy to settle for a safe, gaffe-free performance in which his main goal was to reassure the US public that he was not a warmonger. </p> <p>On issue after issue, from Iranian sanctions to withdrawal from Afghanistan, there was little difference between his position and that of the administration, but Romney insisted he would have projected American strength more effectively. \"Nowhere in the world is our influence greater than it was four years ago,\" said Romney.</p> <p>But while the debate was supposed to be solely about foreign policy, domestic concerns were never far from the surface and the candidates took every opportunity to pivot to their stump speech attacks over the economy and tax. The same was true in the spin room afterwards where both campaign teams dispensed quickly with debate comments and moved instead to analysis of the state of the race in swing states. </p> <p>One of the most telling moments came when Obama, in a flash of normally suppressed arrogance, lectured Romney on military developments as if he was a child. Responding to a pledge by Romney to increase military spending and a complaint that the navy had fewer ships, Obama resorted to heavy sarcasm. </p> <p> \"You mentioned the navy, for example, and that we have fewer ships than we did in 1917. Well, governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military's changed. We have these things called aircraft carriers, where planes land on them. We have these ships that go underwater, nuclear submarines,\" Obama said.</p> <p>But Romney did not crumple and recovered in the second half, in particular when he managed to drag the debate on to domestic economic concerns.</p> <p>On the Middle East he said an attack on Iran would be a last resort and that he was against direct US military involvement in Syria. He sought to neutralise the advantage Obama enjoys thanks to the killing of Osama bin Laden by insisting that his own policy was about more than \"going after the bad guys\". \"We can't just kill our way out of this mess,\" Romney said. </p> <p>Romney managed to get in some hits on Obama too, accusing him of having conducted \"an apology tour\" of the Middle East at the start of his presidency and this was perceived by America's enemies as a sign of weakness. \"Mr President, America has not dictated to other nations. We have freed other nations from dictators,\" he said. </p> <p>The idea that Obama is an apologist for American values resonates strongly among conservatives.</p> <p>Obama responded by describing the \"apology tour\" as \"probably the biggest whopper that's been told during the course of this campaign\". </p> <p>\"If we're going to talk about trips that we've taken,\" Obama said, in a reference to Romney's widely criticised summer tour of Britain, Poland and Israel, \"when I was a candidate for office, first trip I took was to visit our troops. And when I went to Israel as a candidate, I didn't take donors. I didn't attend fundraisers ... I went to ... the Holocaust museum there to remind myself of the nature of evil and why our bond with Israel will be unbreakable.\"</p> <p>The instant polls agreed that Obama carried the night. Public Policy Polling published a poll showing Obama won the debate 53% to 42%. A CNN poll gave it to Obama by 48% to 40%.</p> <p>But few believe that the clash will have done much to affect the course of the race, which enters its final two weeks with Romney still enjoying a surge that began after his triumph over a listless Obama in the first debate in Denver on 3 October.</p> <p>Obama won the second to put himself back in the race. Although he also won the third, foreign policy is not a major concern for voters and it is unlikely to result in any major poll swings.</p> <p>The exchanges revealed there is little major difference between the two in term of their approach to security and foreign affairs. On Iran both vowed it will not be allowed to have nuclear weapons. Rommey said he would introduce more stringent sanctions; Obama said they were already as stringent as they could possibly be.</p> <p>Suprisingly there was almost nothing on the Benghazi consulate attack. Having twice botched the issue Romney opted against returning to it in depth.</p> <p>Obama teased Romney over his claim that Russia rather than al-Qaida was America's number one foe. Romney said he had meant Russia was America's biggest geopolitical foe and al-Qaida its biggest security problem.</p> <p>Both agreed that in Syria President Bashar Assad will not survive. Obama said there was no difference between the two on policy towards Syria except that Romney wanted to send heavy weapons to the rebels.</p> <p>Romney said America should be arming the \"responsible\" rebels. \"Syria is an opportunity for us,\" Romney said. \"Syria is Iran's only ally in the Arab world ... so seeing Syria remove Assad is a very high priority for us ... We should have taken a leading role.\"</p> <p>The two jostled over who was the closest to Israel, with Romney berating Obama for failing to visit Israel during a Middle East tour.</p> <p>Stuart Stevens, one of Romney's chief advisers, said: \"The more people see Governor Romney the more comfortable they are with him.\"</p> <p>He criticised Obama for the sarcasm he displayed over the smaller navy. \"I do not think his tone and demeanour is something that people would find attractive,\" Stevens said.</p> <p>David Plouffe, one of Obama's chief advisers, said: \"The president was strong. Romney was unsteady.\"</p>",

He seemed to relax when the subject shifted to the economy, education and tax.</p> <p>One of the most vivid moments was when Obama, in a flash of arrogance, patronised his opponent, treating him as if he was a child. Lecturing him on military history after Romney complained the navy had fewer ships, Obama said: \"You mentioned the navy, for example, and that we have fewer ships than we did in 1916. Well, governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets, because the nature of our military's changed. We have these things called aircraft carriers, where planes land on them. We have these ships that go underwater, nuclear submarines.\"</p> <p>Will this debate make a difference? Probably not. Although Romney was poor, he was not disastrously bad. And he got across his message that he is not belligerent. Talking about Iran, he said the US \"can't kill our way out of this mess\". That is what a war-weary America wants to hear. An attack on Iran would be a last resort, Romney said. He made peace a central part of his closing speech.</p> <p>Neither Obama or Romney made any serious gaffes or produced any zingers.&#xa0;The first debate in Denver, where Obama was overwhelmed, was a game-changer.

  "<p>Mitt Romney's more attentive supporters may have been surprised to hear him outline a strategy to combat Islamic extremism that sounded awfully like the nation-building increasingly out of favour with Republicans as costly and ineffective. Not only that, he mentioned the widely despised United Nations in the same positive breath.</p> <p>Romney painted Barack Obama as weak in the Middle East, and accused him of opening the way to a resurgent al-Qaida and other expressions of Islamic extremism from Libya to Mali. Romney even described the election of a Muslim Brotherhood president, Mohamed Morsi, in Egypt as part of a \"pretty dramatic reversal in the kind of hopes we had for that region\", even though he also said the US works to promote elections.</p> <p>Romney went on to congratulate Obama on killing Osama bin Laden and other al-Qaida leaders.</p> <p>\"But we can't kill our way out of this mess,\" he added. \"We're going to have to put in place a very comprehensive and robust strategy to help the world of Islam and other parts of the world, reject this radical violent extremism, which is certainly not on the run.\"</p> <p>Romney elaborated on the theme later in the debate. He spurned invasions and instead advocated a policy of engagement with hallmarks of nation-building, even going so far to helping create civil societies.</p> <p>\"The key that we're going to have to pursue is a pathway to get the Muslim world to be able to reject extremism on its own. We don't want another Iraq; we don't want another Afghanistan. That's not the right course for us,\" he said.</p> <p>\"The right course for us is to make sure that we go after the people who are leaders of these various anti-American groups and these jihadists, but also help the Muslim world. And how do we do that? A group of Arab scholars came together, organised by the UN, to look at how we can help the world reject these terrorists.\"</p> <p>Romney said the scholars came up with a list of four priorities for foreign countries to combat Islamic extremism, beginning with economic development.</p> <p>\"We should key our foreign aid, our direct foreign investment, and that of our friends, we should coordinate it to make sure that we push back and give them more economic development,\" he said. \"No 2, better education. No 3, gender equality. No 4, the rule of law. We have to help these nations create civil societies.\"</p> <p>The experience of the US, European countries and other nations involved in trying to construct the rule of law, expand education systems and promote equality as well as economic development in other parts of the world, such as Africa, is complicated, expensive and laced with failure among the successes.</p> <p>It usually requires an extended financial commitment \u2013 not something that will be particularly welcome to Republicans who have their eye on the foreign aid budget for deeper spending cuts.</p> <p>Immediately after the debate, Congressman Mike Rogers, a Republican hawk, denied that Romney was promoting nation-building. Rogers said the Republican candidate intends to use trade to pressure governments to change. </p> <p>\"He was talking about better engagement. You can't walk away from those relationships completely. We are for commerce, not conflict. What he was trying to say is we need to use American strength to pursue gender equality, which you see deteriorating all across the Middle East today. We show strength through trade agreements, using our economic power to try to bring those nations along into a more moderate place,\" he said.</p> <p>And on education and civil society? </p> <p>\"He wasn't talking about building schools,\" said Rogers.</p> <p>John Sununu, George Bush Sr's chief of staff, said Romney had identified the causes of the Arab uprisings that had to be addressed if conflict is to be quelled.</p> <p>\"I think he's laying down a set of principles that are important for the world as it deals with the realities of unrest that have been expressed in the Arab Spring. There's a reason people are demonstrating in the streets and they correspond to the points Mitt Romney was making and he's saying those countries have to find a way to deal with it if they want us to help them economically,\" he said.</p> <p>But does that mean more aid and direct involvement?</p> <p>\"Romney's smart enough to know it's a different package for different countries,\" said Sununu.</p>",

We have these ships that go underwater, nuclear submarines. </p> </blockquote> <h2>The internet's response: (via <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com\">Buzzfeed</a>)</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mcbq3v8lj11qz581wo2_500.gif\"> <img src=\"https://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mcbq3v8lj11qz581wo2_500.gif\" width= 460px /> </figure>  <p></p>  <figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mcbq3v8lj11qz581wo1_500.gif\"> <img src=\"https://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mcbq3v8lj11qz581wo1_500.gif\" width= 460px /> </figure>  <p></p> <p>The quote prompted the creation of a couple of odd Tumblrs <a href=\"http://romneysmilitary.tumblr.com/\">like this one</a>, but the real response was on Twitter.

Now, soldiers learn how to use a bayonet if someone takes control of their \"primary weapon\".</p>",
  "<p>If the world could vote on 6 November, Barack Obama would win by a landslide. A global poll for the BBC World Service revealed that 20 out of 21 countries preferred the president to his challenger. But when you watched the presidential debate on foreign policy on Monday night you had to wonder why. Not because Mitt Romney was better, but because on matters of policy, Obama was almost as bad. It takes a friend to reveal the harsh truth to the global community, so here it is: \"Obama's just not that into you.\"</p> <p>No one could love Israel more, care less about the Palestinians, put more pressure on Iran or be a greater fan of drone attacks or invading Libya. Both candidates agreed that America's task was to spread freedom around the world: nobody mentioned Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Abu Ghraib or rendition. \"Governor, you're saying the same things as us, but you'd say them louder,\" said Obama. It was a good line. The trouble was it condemned them both.</p> <p>It was one of many lines Obama delivered that sought not just to correct Romney but belittle him. \"When it comes to our foreign policy, you seem to want to import the foreign policies of the 1980s, just like the social policies of the 1950s and the economic policies of the 1920s.\"</p> <p>When Romney complained that America had fewer ships in the US navy than in 1916, Obama answered: \"We also have fewer horses and bayonets.\"</p> <p>Obama's task was to cast his opponent as an opportunist out of his depth, not waving at the electorate but drowning before them. Promising to be \"strong and steady not wrong and reckless,\" he painted Romney at every opportunity as a flip-flopper.</p> <p>Romney had a tougher task. With the race tightening and just two weeks to go until polling day, he had to focus the national imagination on the prospect of a President Romney. His problem was that Obama had left no room to the right on foreign policy that would not have left Romney sounding like Herman Cain (who would probably bomb Ubeki-beki-beki-beki-stan-stan if only he had known where it was).</p> <p>So after a month of shape-shifting, fact-mangling and question-dodging Romney finally morphed into a peacenik. \"But we can't kill our way out of this mess,\" he said, with a plausibility that would have had him booed off stage in a Republican primary.</p> <p>He spoke of promoting peace and democracy as though that had been the idea all along, and America's benevolent instincts had been blown off course by some freak wind. He parried Obama's slights as though they were beneath him. \"Attacking me is not an agenda,\" was one retort. \"I've got a policy for the future,\" was another.</p> <p>But there are only so many times you can shake an Etch A Sketch before its capacity to form an image starts to falter. Romney was less than convincing. And while Obama's put-downs were well-rehearsed, they also worked. He came out on top although it's difficult to imagine he changed any minds or converted any waverers.</p> <p>Both men, when given half a chance, tried to steer the debate back to the central issue in the election \u2013 the economy. Viewers could be forgiven for thinking the answers to issues relating to Iran, Afghanistan, the Middle East, Iraq or China were Obamacare, educational reform, tax rates and loopholes.</p> <p>This was the last set-piece of the campaign. After the primaries, conventions and two previous debates, all that's left now are doors to knock, phones to ring and rallies to attend. On the ground and in the heartland there is still everything to play for. But from the podiums and the spin rooms the campaign has played itself out.</p>",

Talking about Iran, he said the US \"can't kill our way out of this mess\". That is what a war-weary America wants to hear. An attack on Iran would be a last resort, Romney said. He made peace a central part of his closing speech.</p> <p>Neither Obama or Romney made any serious gaffes or produced any zingers.&#xa0;The first debate in Denver, where Obama was overwhelmed, was a game-changer. But neither this one nor the one in New York have had the same impact or are likely to.

He criticises Romney for describing Russia as the number one foe of the US \u2013 suggesting he has borrowed his foreign policy from the 1980s.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-23T02:01:15.141Z\">at 3.01am BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5085ec0358f96784ee29090b\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-23T00:59:47.644Z\">1.59am <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Schieffs</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"\" >  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mcbmq0rAFz1rg2rf7o1_r1_500.gif&quot; /&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Debate moderator <strong>Bob Schieffer</strong> heads out, forcing the tv news channels to lift their focus from <strong>Michelle Obama</strong> and <strong>Ann Romney</strong>, who take their seats and pretend to be enjoying themselves.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/22/bob-schieffer-boca-raton-debate-moderator\">Will Schieffer face a similar fate as his moderator-predecessors</a>, who have been roundly-panned for their chairing skills after the previous debates?

They are not heroes. They are scumbags. All they have done is damage to the sport.\"</p> <p>On Friday his management committee will meet to decide whether the runners-up to Armstrong in those seven Tours will be retrospectively handed a winner's yellow jersey or whether those races will be deemed to have had no winner. The complication of elevating riders from second and third places is that so many of them have subsequently been implicated in doping scandals.</p> <p>The committee will also discuss whether or not Armstrong will be made to refund his $3m of Tour prize money, as was requested on Monday by ASO, the race's owners. Traditionally the winner's cheque is divided between all the riders of his team, many of whom testified against him to Usada.</p> <p>SCA Promotions, an insurance company, has said that it will demand repayment of $7.5m in bonuses and on Monday Armstrong lost the last of his big personal sponsorships when Oakley sunglasses announced that it was following Nike, RadioShack and Anheuser-Busch by terminating its relationship with the cyclist.</p> <p>McQuaid denounced the claims made by Landis and Hamilton that their team leader had given more than $100,000 to the UCI in order to persuade it to cover up an alleged positive test for EPO at the 2001 Tour de Suisse. The money was said to have been used to buy a blood analysis machine to increase the effectiveness of the UCI's dope testing programme.</p> <p>While admitting that Armstrong had indeed made two donations, one of $25,000 in 2002 and another of $100,000 promised in 2005 and paid in 2007, McQuaid said that any suggestion of a cover-up was \"absolutely untrue\". In similar circumstances, he said, he would accept further donations from riders \u2013 \"but in a different way\".</p> <p>Friday's committee meeting will also consider the possibility of setting up some sort of truth and reconciliation process on the lines of that utilised by the South African government in the wake of apartheid, including the notion of an amnesty. \"The trouble is that amnesty means different things in different languages,\" Philippe Verbiest, the UCI's legal advisor, said on Monday. \"It's not something that you can figure out in one day.\"</p> <p>The idea of an amnesty does not, however, appear to extend to journalists. McQuaid confirmed that he and his predecessor, Hein Verbruggen, will be continuing their legal action for alleged defamation against the Irish journalist and former rider Paul Kimmage, one of a handful of reporters who showed the persistence and courage to pursue the Armstrong story through years of veiled and explicit threats.</p> <p>\"It's a straight defamation case,\" McQuaid said. \"He called us corrupt.\" Supporters of Kimmage, whose book Rough Ride, published in 1990, was the first to expose systematic doping in the modern peloton, have raised a significant sum of money to help with his defence.</p> <p>The World Anti-Doping agency said on Monday night it was \"encouraged\" that the UCI felt it could use the case as a \"catalyst\" to thoroughly clean up the sport. But it also warned that the governing body needed to act on evidence of doping, no matter how long ago, and said it would await \"with interest\" the decisions the UCI planned to take on Friday.</p> <p>\"The fact the World Anti-Doping Code only came into force in 2004 is not a valid excuse for an organisation failing to act on evidence of widespread doping, and nor is the Statute of Limitations contained within the Code an excuse not to investigate evidence of doping that dates back longer than eight years,\" said Wada's president, John Fahey.</p> <p>The organisation will have three weeks from the end of the month to decide whether to appeal against the UCI's verdict.</p> <p>Fahey added: \"It will announce that decision in due course, and will continue to examine the evidence encouraged by the fact that the biggest doping scandal in the history of sport is close to reaching a correct conclusion.\"</p>"
