  "<p>My initial reaction to Mitt Romney's selection of Paul Ryan as his vice-presidential nominee was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/11/how-much-will-paul-ryan-help-mitt-romney\">one of befuddlement</a>. Although it had been widely reported that Ryan was a finalist, the move made little electoral sense to me.</p> <p>As I noted on Saturday, the biggest electoral impact a vice-president has is in their home state, where they usually add a few points to the presidential ticket's margin. Wisconsin is a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ForecasterEnten/status/234015269272571905\">somewhat close state</a>, but not a state where Ryan can be expected to put Romney over the top. Ohio remains the tipping-point state in this election. Romney is about 3 percentage points behind Obama in Ohio, and it's easy to imagine how the selection of Senator Rob Portman could have given Romney the edge he needed in the Buckeye State.</p> <p>A secondary electoral effect is vice-presidential nominees can motivate the base. That can be crucial in a <a href=\"http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/articles/aia2011070702/\">\"base\" election</a>, such as 2004 was \u2013 and 2012 is expected to be. The conservative base, however, was <a href=\"http://themonkeycage.org/blog/2012/08/11/paul-ryan-the-base-mobilization-strategy-that-romney-doesnt-need/\">already quite motivated</a> before the Ryan announcement. Animating the base might also have been important if Romney was suffering from lackluster fund-raising, but Romney and his Super Pacs were already set to have a <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/mitt-romneys-money-edge--and-whether-it-matters/2012/08/07/c5a1763a-e006-11e1-a19c-fcfa365396c8_blog.html\">money advantage</a> going into the final months.</p> <p>Beyond that, vice-presidents <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/mar/26/mitt-romney-choose-vp-running-mate\">usually have little impact</a> on the final outcome of the election. There is some evidence that views on Sarah Palin <a href=\"http://themonkeycage.org/blog/2009/04/05/a_tantalizing_graph_featuring/\">may have correlated</a> with voting intention, but the end result in 2008 was right where <a href=\"http://pollyvote.forecastingprinciples.com/index.php/pollys-archive/polly-2008/pollycomp-models.html\">most econometric models</a> would have pegged it.</p> <p>So why, then, did Romney choose Ryan?</p> <p>Some are taking the Ryan pick as a sign that Romney made a <a href=\"http://firstread.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/08/13/13257616-first-thoughts-shake-it-up?lite\">calculated decision</a> based on polling and focus group data that he couldn't win on the current path of his campaign. He couldn't win by making this election solely a referendum on President Obama's job performance \u2013 so he had to make it a \"game-changing\" choice. Supporting this argument is the fact that a <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/us/general_election_romney_vs_obama-1171.html\">number of polls</a> came out last week showing Romney down by high single-digits.</p> <p>As Mark Halperin <a href=\"http://thepage.time.com/2012/08/12/hail-paul/\">points out</a>, however, there are two different sets of poll numbers. Yes, some polls have the gap in high single digits, but another set has Obama and Romney within 2 points of each other. The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ForecasterEnten/status/234015269272571905\">state data</a> support this closer race. Most sources inside the campaigns acknowledge that the polls showing a tighter race are likely closer to the truth.</p> <p>Mitt Romney's own pollster Neil Newhouse <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/bensmith/romney-picked-ryan-over-advisors-early-doubts\">was against</a> the selection of Ryan. A pollster's job is to give his candidate the hard numbers. Newhouse probably understood that when you're right on goal line, you don't <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/11/mitt-romney-acquires-risky-asset-paul-ryan-vp\">throw a Hail Mary</a>. The situation instead dictates that you should run the football with a safe pick. Newhouse's advice was the opposite of what John McCain's pollster and Newhouse partner Bill McInturff <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1848902/fullcredits\">gave in 2008</a> when McCain was persuaded that he needed a \"game-changer\".</p> <p>Indeed, Mitt Romney <a href=\"http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=24CB8F96-AAAC-435F-8581-2EAC9A8B4E13\">requested that no focus groups or polls</a> ask how potential vice-presidential nominees would play with the public.&#xa0;If he had, he would have seen there were plenty of other candidates, from Marco Rubio to Chris Christie, who made more sense from a shake-up angle.</p> <p>So, if Romney was consciously disregarding what polling might tell him and what his pollster actually was saying, then there would be three non-electoral reasons that propelled him to chose Ryan.</p> <p>First, Romney saw a lot of Ryan in himself. As Robert Costa <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/313555/ryan-way-robert-costa\">reported</a>, Romney loves analytical research and data-crunching investigation. While some could quibble with the description of Ryan as a \"policy wonk\", Romney commented&#xa0;in Sunday night's <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=7417928n\">60 Minutes interview</a>&#xa0;that he saw Ryan and himself that way. Second to a vice-president being ready potentially to be president on day one, the most important quality for a vice-president is to have a good working relationship with the president.</p> <p>Second, and relatedly,&#xa0;Romney wanted fresh, big ideas. Romney made a habit of hiring young talent at Bain Capital. Someone who sees a problem in a different way than he does excites him; someone even who would tell him why he's wrong about an issue. The other final choices on the list Rob Portman and Tim Pawlenty probably would not fulfil that role.</p> <p>Third, Romney was <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/07/13/romney-s-possible-pick-of-pro-choice-condoleezza-rice-for-veep-has-gop-abuzz.html\">never going to choose a moderate</a>. The three presumed finalists are all politicians who can be described as conservative. Romney also got along well with Chris Christie: while the New Jersey governor can be confrontational, he was likely to be seen as too moderate to make up a Romney ticket. Condoleezza Rice, another object of speculation last week, would have ticked the policy wonk box, but she is pro-choice.</p> <p>Ryan's selection is revealing: the signal Romney is giving with this pick is that he wants to do more than just win the election; he has chosen to pitch a conservative vision for the US. Whether or not that plan will sell with the American public is to be determined.</p>",

But in the longer term Ryan is, like Palin, \"not going to be a plus for Mr Romney\", Axelrod said.</p> <p>Romney went campaigning on his own in Florida on Monday while Ryan went to Iowa to shadow Obama, who begins a three-day bus tour of the state, before hopping to Colorado, another swing state, where he will campaign on Tuesday.</p> <p>Ryan attracted a large crowd to his speech at the Iowa state fair, including noisy hecklers who accused him of waging war on the working-class.</p> <p>A New York Times reporter said Obama, at a fundraiser in his hometown Chicago on Sunday, attracted only a half-full crowd for an event where ticket prices began at $51. The Romney campaign spokesman, Ryan Williams, tweeted: \"The thrill has gone.\"</p> <p>The Obama campaign, as well as other journalists, disputed the the New York Times assessment by the reporter, who later deleted her first comment and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jodikantor/status/234754247391068162\">posted a modified tweet</a>.</p> <p>By contrast, the<a href=\"http://www.news-record.com/content/2012/08/10/article/romney_campaign_releases_details_about_his_nc_visits\"> Greensboro News-Record reported</a> that a Romney-Ryan double act on Sunday attracted between 10,000 and 15,000 to a campaign event in High Point, North Carolina. The venue had room for only 1,200 and most of the crowd were not able to get into the venue.</p> <p>With polls showing a tight race in which the bulk of the voters have already made up their mind, some strategists calculate that the election will be decided not so much by swing voters but by getting out the party base. Making Ryan the vice-presidential running mate could help Romney generate enthusiasm among the party grassroots.</p> <p>But there is also a downside. Ryan's proposals to shake-up the popular healthcare programme for those aged 65 and over, Medicare, is a potential election-changing issue in states such as Florida, with its high proportion of retirees. But Ohio, another key swing state, also has a high proportion of Medicare recipients.</p> <p>The Romney campaign denied this was why Ryan was sent to Iowa rather than Florida and stressed the Wisconsin congressman will be campaigning in Florida on Saturday.</p> <p>Romney attracted a big crowd at his first event in Florida, at Flagler College, but this may have been partly because of earlier publicity suggesting that Ryan would also be present. As in North Carolina, some of the crowd had to listen from outside.</p> <p>Romney defended Ryan's proposed Medicare shake-up, saying reform is necessary to protect the programme for future generations. \"We want to make sure that we preserve and protect Medicare,\" Romney said.</p> <p>At the same time, he has left himself a loophole if the controversy begins to damage his campaign, saying that the budget if he wins the White House would be his rather than Ryan's.</p> <p>An Obama campaign spokeswoman, Jan Psaki, travelling with the president to Iowa, tied Romney to the Ryan budget plan, saying he had described it as \"marvellous\". She added: \"As the old saying goes, birds of a feather flock together.\"</p> <p>She also criticised Ryan for so far failing to support Obama's farm bill to help farmers hit by the drought in states such as Iowa, one of the themes the president is to pursue on his tour.</p>",
  "<p>Sometimes there is something quite refreshing about being proved utterly wrong. I was an early Olympic refusenik because, as a Londoner, I felt I would be embarrassed by the inability of our capital's 19th-century infrastructure to cope. As a designer, I was&#xa0;convinced that we would end up with committee-led second-rate architecture and design or the political meddling that beset the Millennium Dome. Also, as a Jamaican by birth, I&#xa0;felt it would be better to be away in the Caribbean celebrating the country's independence and avoiding everything that London would throw up over these last two weeks.</p> <p>But, besides the awful Wenlock and Mandeville, I have been totally wrong on every count and have experienced a London that has been more vibrant, alive and exciting than I can ever recall.

  "<p>After delivering what has been hailed at home and abroad as a triumph \u2013 one Italian newspaper on Monday called it \"the miracle of London\" \u2013 Lord Coe was short and to the point when he was asked if he fancied a return to frontline politics. \"Politics left me in a very big way in 1997,\" he said.</p> <p>Instead, after ensuring that his team \"runs through the line\" to deliver the Paralympic Games with the same precision and passion as they oversaw the Olympics, Coe would be forgiven for taking some time out to spend with his family (he recently remarried), write a book, indulge his love of Chelsea Football Club and review his options.</p> <p>But with the same rigour that he brought to his athletic career and the Locog role, he is likely to have already planned his next move with precision.</p> <p>He will do so from a position of strength, surfing a level of public approval he has not known since his track days. It has been a long journey, from being crashed onto the judo mat by the now foreign secretary when he was William Hague's chief of staff to receiving the heartfelt cheers of 80,000 people in recognition of a Games that had been delivered to his own design but succeeded beyond even his expectations.</p> <p>No other Olympic Games has been so umbilically linked with one man.</p> <p>For nine years, since he took over as leader of the bid from Barbara Cassani until Sunday's closing ceremony, he has steadfastly refused to engage in any debate about what he might do afterwards.</p> <p>But as the opening ceremony loomed, he confirmed in public what has been an open secret in the sports administration world for some time and said he would like to become the next president of the International Association of Athletics Federations.</p> <p>With the automatic International Olympic Committee membership that would confer, he would have a path to getting on to the executive board of the most powerful body in world sport and, perhaps, a tilt at becoming president.</p> <p>Although the incumbent, Lamine Diack, is unlikely to step down until his term ends in 2015, and the Ukrainian former pole vaulter Sergey Bubka would be an obstacle in his path, Coe would be the favourite to succeed the Senegalese at the IAAF.</p> <p>The 55-year-old remains passionate about his sport and amid the punishing schedule of the Games seemed to only really come alive in discussing the athletic achievements of Mo Farah, Usain Bolt or David Rudisha. As he sat alongside Diack at a press conference on Saturday night, shortly before Farah stormed to gold, he wore the air of a man who had delivered for his sport.</p> <p>He sees in London an opportunity now to reconnect the British public with track and field and restore the sport to its 1980s heyday when he, Steve Cram, Steve Ovett and Peter Elliott had the country rapt and it was considered on a par with football, rugby and cricket in terms of popularity.</p> <p>Since his time as a double Olympic hero, the intervening years had not necessarily been kind to perceptions of Coe among the public at large. A successful businessman then a Tory MP, there was a prevailing impression that he was a bit too clever for his own good. Even up until the eve of the Games, his achievements as Locog chair seemed to inspire grudging respect rather than warm appreciation. The successful delivery of a feelgood Games to a giddy nation has changed all that.</p> <p>Where he sometimes seemed a fish out of water in Westminster, he has proved himself a hugely effective operator in the sometimes arcane world of international sports politics.</p> <p>In league with an effective team including chief executive Sir Keith Mills, and Sir Craig Reedie, then BOA chairman and now IOC executive board member, he did what many others had failed to do before him and got London's bid over the winning line in Singapore.</p> <p>Those networking skills were also in evidence last year as London beat Doha to the 2017 world athletics championships. Sealing that deal was crucial for Coe if he was to secure an athletics legacy for the \u00a3428m Olympic Stadium that had become a political hot potato amid a botched process to find a football club to move in.</p> <p>Given Coe's instinctive recoil from going back into party politics, accepting David Cameron's offer to take up an as yet ill-defined role as a \"legacy ambassador\" could yet come back to bite him.</p> <p>He had previously endlessly spoken of \"passing the baton\" when he faced searching questions on delivering the legacy promises he made in Singapore that helped secure the Games, intimating that he preferred to keep up the pressure on politicians from outside the tent.</p> <p>Coe may think that the part time, unpaid role will mean lending his name to drives for overseas investment, but there is a danger he will now be made answerable for the government's increasingly confused sports policy. Rather than being able to put pressure on politicians from above the fray, he may find himself dragged down into squabbles over school sport and grassroots investment.</p> <p>On the other hand, he may feel that he can help draw together the sort of cross-party consensus that pretty much held for the duration of the London 2012 project. Given the potential jeopardy of getting it wrong, and the potential upside of getting it right, mortal political enemies such as Ken Livingstone and Boris Johnson, or Tessa Jowell and Jeremy Hunt, stood side by side.</p> <p>\"I don't see this as being inside the tent or outside the tent. I was asked by the prime minister if I would play my part alongside others about how we can maximally leverage every ounce of legacy. I'm very happy to play my part. The basis of what we said in Singapore was not simply the successful delivery of the Olympic and Paralympic Games, but there had to be a follow up story to that,\" he said on Monday.</p> <p>But without the glue of a huge single project with \u00a39.3bn and Britain's international reputation at stake, it will be hard.</p> <p>Longer term, his eyes are on the IAAF and the IOC. Reedie and Coe in harness have never lost an election, and are confident he can land the IAAF presidency in time to be in post for the 2017 world athletics championships in London. By then, there will be a new IOC president: Tthe incumbent, Jacques Rogge, will step down next year at the end of a 12 year term.</p> <p>The favourite to replace him, the German Thomas Bach, would be likely to serve for a further eight or 12 years.</p> <p>There is a chance that Coe, who will be 68 by then, could look to challenge for presidency then. Bach is considered a clear favourite but other names in the frame include Puerto Rican Richard Carrion, the Swiss Denis Oswald and the Moroccan former 400m gold medallist Nawal El Moutawakel, who would be the first female IOC president.</p> <p>Coe knows the IOC corridors of power well, having chaired its first ever athletes' commission, but succession to the top table requires years if not decades of networking and power-broking. It is a slow-moving but cut-throat world and the desire to have a non-European president may count against him.</p> <p>IOC insiders think it more likely he will have to ultimately settle for an influential place on the executive board, combined with the role of overseeing international track and field.</p> <p>With his own legacy assured after delivering a Games that will live long in the memory, Rogge said that having delivered London's \"happy and glorious\" Games Coe could effectively do whatever he wanted to at their joint closing press conference.</p> <p>\"He is a man with his heart in the right place, he thinks about the athletes first. He has a lot of skills. He should have a great future not only in sport but in society. I have a high esteem for Sebastian,\" said Rogge in the manner of a kindly elder brother.</p> <p>Rogge also paid tribute to Coe's ability to build a team and much of his success can be attributed to his luck and judgment in hiring well.</p> <p>That can be seen most clearly in his choice of former banker Paul Deighton as chief executive, but also in Jean Tomlin, the HR director who oversaw volunteer recruitment, and Debbie Jevans, his director of sport, who delivered innovative and engaging stages for the athletes to perform on.</p> <p>The most telling example, though, was the warmth and mutual respect between Coe and Danny Boyle, the left-leaning film director who delivered London's spectacular opening ceremony and set the tone for what was to come. It was Coe who protected Boyle from political interference and allowed him to pursue his vision.</p> <p>Cameron, who has clearly enjoyed basking in the success of Team GB's athletes but has seemed less sure footed on capitalising on the sporting legacy, might do well to listen to his new \"legacy ambassador\" on the need to approach a complex topic with sensitivity and care.</p> <p>\"That cross-party debate I hope is a grown-up debate. The one thing that politicians of any hue now recognise is there is an appetite for that,\" said Coe.</p>",
  "<p>A day after celebrating Team GB's best medal haul in over a century Lord Moynihan revealed plans to step down as chairman of the British Olympic Association more than a year early. Moynihan, who has been in the job for seven years, is the first senior sports administrator to exit in what is likely to be a period of upheaval amid uncertainty as to the future shape of the post-Games landscape.</p> <p>Over the next year vacancies will arise for the chairmanship of both the elite funding body UK Sport, where Sue Campbell is the incumbent, and the grass-roots quango Sport England, where the All England Club chief executive, Richard Lewis, has promised to stay on until a successor is found.</p> <p>Moynihan's term had not been due to end until November 2013. The election process will be considered at the next BOA board meeting in September, with his successor likely to be decided in November.</p> <p>The former Tory MP, who won a silver medal at the 1980 Moscow Olympics as a cox for the men's rowing eight, said he was \"passing on the baton\" to his successor early in order to give him or her time to prepare for the Sochi 2014 Winter Games and participate in the debate over the BOA's future role. \"I have given this a great deal of thought and I strongly believe that this is the right time: a new chair must have the opportunity to play a central role in the future strategy and direction of the BOA, and he or she must be integrally involved in the preparations for Sochi which, after all, is only just over 18 months away,\" he wrote in a letter to the National Olympic Committee.</p> <p>\"It is for this reason that I have made my decision now to ensure as long a period as possible for my successor to become established in the role ahead of the next Games.\"</p> <p>Among the candidates to succeed Moynihan will be Richard Leman, the president of GB Hockey and a BOA board member. David Hemery, the 400m gold medallist in 1968 and also a BOA board member, could be another contender.</p> <p>Moynihan's tenure has been underpinned by his desire to overhaul the BOA's commercial prospects, moving to new offices in London's west end and hiring an expensive new executive team in the process. The organisation is facing a \u00a32m black hole unless it can agree a deal with the government, though Moynihan has always maintained that the contract signed with Locog to assign to the Olympic copyright for seven years woefully undervalued them.</p> <p>There were debilitating rows with the World Anti-Doping Agency over the BOA's lifetime drug ban and the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games over the fate of any post-Games surplus. But he will go out on a high, having helped deliver the best British medal performance in more than a century by overseeing a \u00a313m support operation for the athletes.</p>",

  "<p>Going on holiday is a risky business when you are president of France. When Nicolas Sarkozy borrowed the luxury yacht of a French billionaire businessman, his image never recovered. A string of flash holidays thereafter didn't help, nor did Paris Match magazine obligingly airbrushing out the love-handles from an unflattering picture of him canoeing in white bermuda shorts in New Hampshire.</p> <p>So when the new president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, headed to the beach this month, he continued his political branding exercise as \"President Normal\". First came orchestrated photographs of the president and his partner ,Valerie Trierweiler, taking the train rather than private jet. At the decidedly not normal official presidential summer retreat at Fort Br\u00e9gan\u00e7on on the C\u00f4te d'Azur, they went off to shake hands with \"normal\" sunbathers on the beach and sipped Perrier. Hollande's blue bermuda shorts and&#xa0;Trierweiler's black&#xa0;bikini were obligingly described as \"normal\" by celebrity magazines.</p> <p>But the careful communications plan was nearly upset when the satirical weekly Le Canard Enchaine reported the arrival of a large order of cushions from an exclusive Spanish design firm. Spending money on luxury padding for the presidential backside when France was about to enter recession risked being dangerously off-message.</p> <p>Whatever the holiday PR, things are not looking sunny for Hollande. Opinion polls show that Normal is not enough. TuesdayToday marks Hollande's first 100 days in power, a symbolic moment. The latest Ifop poll, published in the rightwing newspaper <a href=\"http://www.lefigaro.fr/politique/2012/08/10/01002-20120810ARTFIG00490-francois-hollande-confronte-au-pessimisme-des-francais.php\" title=\"Le Figaro\">Le Figaro</a>, found confidence in Hollande was sliding. Even if 57% of French people agreed he had kept his election promises \u2013 including the popular moves of lowering his salary, withdrawing French troops from Afghanistan, raising taxes on rich households and allowing people who began work young to retire at 60 \u2013 a majority of people were sceptical about whether he could resolve some of France's biggest problems: the huge public deficit, record 10%&#xa0;unemployment and the death of French industry. More than half of French people were unhappy with his action since his election and 51% thought France was changing for the worse.</p> <p>How to explain the dip in Hollande's ratings so soon after the election? There was never much room for a state of grace in a country struggling with mass layoffs, unemployment, an uncompetitive labour market and an inability to pay for its public services and generous welfare state without borrowing from the markets. September is going to be a killer month \u2013 the government must somehow find \u20ac33bn (\u00a326bn) in tax rises and savings for next year's budget. Hollande's tax increases on the wealthy might be hugely popular, but they aren't enough to balance the books.</p> <p>One problem for Hollande is vocabulary. He came to power on anti-austerity rhetoric but must now decide how to sell the nation what many commentators predict will be an unavoidable austerity plan for France. The government dodges any mention of the dreaded A-word. But even the leftwing daily Lib\u00e9ration is growing tired of this&#xa0;culture of: \"Don't mention the war\". The paper complained this week that while the rest of Europe springs into action on the economic crisis, France is in a \"strange torpor\". The nation knows there must be some kind of collective belt-tightening; there's an impatience about not being told plainly what it will entail.</p> <p>In the summer lull, the rightwing UMP opposition party, fighting its own internal leadership battle, is seizing the moment to slam Hollande for what it calls his dithering and \"inaction\" over Syria. Sarkozy, who in office notoriously cosied up to Bashar al-Assad, has publicly twisted the knife over the need for French \"action\" to stop the carnage. Hollande, punctuating his vacation with public appearances, has retorted that France was pushing hard for a \"political solution\" in Syria. He might have had a quiet seaside 58th birthday celebration this weekend, he has not yet caught the train back to Paris, but Hollande's holiday is clearly over.</p>",

The software upgrade will prime the plutonium-powered, 900kg vehicle to begin driving across the floor of the 155km-wide Gale Crater.</p> <p>Curiosity's cameras will next target the peak of Mount Sharp, which rises 5.5km above the floor of Gale Crater. The mountain at the centre of the crater towers over the landing site but the bulk of it was missed off the rover's pre-programmed panorama. Studying Mount Sharp's foothills is the ultimate scientific goal of the rover.</p> <p>Colour images from planetary spacecraft are traditionally derived from separate black-and-white images taken through colour filters. Curiosity takes colour images in a single step, using built-in colour filters \u2013 the same technique used in consumer digital cameras and smartphones.</p> <p>The images returned so far show a barren plain peppered by gravel and small rocks, with the distant hills that form the walls of Gale Crater partially obscured by a \"haze\" of dust suspended in Mars's thin atmosphere. Dunes are visible between the rover and the layered rocks at the base of Mount Sharp.</p> <p>The first images from the rover showed a mysterious <a href=\"http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/msl/multimedia/images/?ImageID=4406\" title=\"\">transient cloud</a>. Some speculation had arisen among keen amateur scientists that the cloud was the short-lived plume of dust thrown up by the intentional crashing of its rocket-powered descent stage. Following analysis of landing site images taken by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, mission management agreed that this kicked-up dust was the likely cause of the feature.</p> <p>The rover's suite of 10 instruments will be used during the planned two-year mission to deduce the geological history of Mars and to determine whether conditions have ever been favourable for microbial life.</p>",
  "<p>A woman will moderate one of the set-piece US presidential debates for the first time in a generation, it was announced Monday.</p> <p>In 1992, ABC's Carole Simpson became the first woman \u2013 and first black American \u2013 to grill White House hopefuls as part of the official head-to-head battles that mark the run-up to a general election.</p> <p>Twenty years later, the Commission on Presidential Debates has named Candy Crowley, chief political correspondent for CNN, as one of three moderators set to question Barack Obama and Mitt Romney in a series of encounters to take place in October.</p> <p>The move will be welcomed by those who have complained of a gender bias when it has come to naming hosts in the past. Earlier this year, three teenage girls from New Jersey set up an online petition titled \"It's Time for a Female Moderator: Equality in the 2012 Debates\".</p> <p>More than 120,000 people have since added their names to the petition, which was posted on the change.org website.</p> <p>Crowley \u2013 who will host the second encounter between Romney and Obama on October 16 \u2013 is joined on the list of moderators by CBS's Bob Schieffer and Jim Lehrer, executive editor of PBS NewsHour.</p> <p>The two men will preside over debates that will focus separately on domestic and foreign policy. Crowley will act as moderator in a televised \"town hall\" event in which members of the public will get to question the two candidates.</p> <p>A one-off vice-presidential debate will also be hosted by a woman, Martha Raddatz, senior foreign affairs correspondent from ABC News.</p> <p>Televised head-to-head clashes between presidential candidates have become a mainstay of the US political landscape. The first one took place in 1960, when then-senator John F Kennedy took on vice-president Richard Nixon. The sight of a pale Nixon with beads of sweat on his upper lip was credited as a reason why he lost the election. The next one did not take place until 1976, after which they have featured in every campaign.</p>",
  "<p>President Barack Obama moved to stem the impact of the worst drought in 50 years as he directed the department of agriculture to buy up to $170m of pork, lamb, chicken and catfish.</p> <p>The move comes as the G20 group of countries are reportedly planning their response to drought and soaring food prices around the world. The US is the world's largest exporter of corn, soybeans and wheat and the drought has already sent prices to record levels.</p> <p>Obama made the announcement on Monday at the start of his three-day trip to Iowa, a swing state the Democrats hope to win in this November's election. The state that has been hit hard by a drought that last week drove US corn prices to an all-time high.</p> <p>The farming crisis is emerging as a key battleground in the 2012 election. The president is trying to pass a farm bill through Congress that he claims will aid farmers but has been stalled by Republicans over what they see as excessive costs.</p> <p>Pressure for action intensified last week as the US department of agriculture (USDA) warned food prices were set to soar. USDA said the worst drought in 50 years had forced farmers to abandon corn fields covering an area larger area than Belgium and Luxembourg combined. The department slashed its forecasts for key crops including corn and soybeans and lowered production forecast for eggs, milk and pork. Blaming \"extreme and dryness\" in the Central Plains and the Corn Belt, the USDA said it now expects this year's corn harvest to be the lowest since 1995-1996.</p> <p>The food Obama intends the purchase will go toward \"food nutrition assistance\" programmes, like food banks. Obama also intends to push the department of defense to speed up purchases and said it was a good time to buy \"while prices are low, and freeze it for later\".</p> <p>\"Right now folks here in Iowa and across the heartland are suffering from one of the worst droughts in 50 years,\" he said. \"Farmers and ranchers depend on a good crop season to pay the bills and put a roof over their heads, and I know that things are tough right now.\"</p> <p>Obama is under pressure to drop laws that mandate the amount of corn ethanol that must be produced each year. This year 13.2bn gallons of corn ethanol will be mixed with gasoline to meet the federal renewable-fuel standards. Its production will require about 40% of this year's crop.</p> <p>Livestock farmers blame the mandate for driving up corn prices. Governors in Maryland and Delaware, two poultry-growing states, have called on Obama to ease the size of the mandate.</p> <p>Last week the United Nations released a report that said world food prices had increased by 6% in July, driven up by a 23% spike in corn prices. Oxfam called for urgent action and said the price rise threatened a return to the crisis of 2008 when similar price hikes triggered riots around the world as the United Nations said a billion people were going hungry.</p> <p>\"This drought, combined with bad policies like ethanol mandates, has put the world's poor on a collision course with a food crisis,\" said Eric Munoz, senior policy advisor for Oxfam America.</p> <p>The impact of the world's poor and on the fragile global economy are likely to be major topics under discussion by the G20 later this month. G20 officials plan to hold a conference at the end of August and set a meeting for late September or early October, according to the Financial Times.</p> <p>In a report to investors Fidelity warned that the rise in agricultural commodity prices \"could not be occurring at a worse time for the global economy with the eurozone sovereign debt crisis still in full flow, China slowing down and the US outlook looking increasingly uncertain. The biggest direct negative effect of higher food prices is on consumers, particularly in emerging markets. As consumers are forced to spend more on food items, discretionary spending is reduced in other areas, creating negative knock-on demand effects for other industries.\"</p>",
  "<p>Now that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/13/paul-ryan-mitt-romney-live\">Representative Paul Ryan has been added to the Republican presidential ticket</a>, we'll have to see the extent to which Governor Romney embraces his running mate's rather extreme economic positions. But earlier in the week, the Romney economic team made its first effort to argue for the merits of <a href=\"http://www.docstoc.com/docs/125714335/Romney-Tax-Reform-White-Paper\">Romney's somewhat more moderate economic plan</a>. It went down in flames.</p> <p>The basic problem is that they have an impossible story. They want to try to blame President Obama for the current weakness of the economy. Their argument, of necessity, focuses on the weakness of the recovery since their guy, President Bush, was calling the shots when things fell apart. This inconvenient fact means that the Romney crew can't focus on the real problem: the severity of the downturn.</p> <p>But this recovery actually has not been extraordinarily weak; in fact, it is stronger by most measures than the 2001-2004 recovery. That recovery was largely guided by the top members of Governor Romney's current economic team, most of whom held senior positions in the Bush administration.</p> <p>This leads Romney's team to argue non sequiturs about how uncertainty over taxation and regulation is impeding investment. This would seem a hard argument to make since taxes are the lowest share of GDP since before second world war and the Obama administration has actually imposed relatively few major regulations.</p> <p>Of course, what makes the argument really tough is that, measured as a share of GDP, investment in equipment and software is pretty much back to its pre-recession level of output. That's impressive given the large amounts of excess capacity in many sectors of the economy. That leaves the Romney team effectively trying to convict President Obama for the murder of a man who turns out to be alive. Good luck with that one.</p> <p>But if the Romney team's efforts on behalf of their candidate seem destined to fail, they may still have the positive effect of bringing about better economics on the Democratic side.</p> <p>In particular, Brad DeLong, a former Clinton administration official who remains close to the economists who guided President Obama's economic policy, seems to have changed his position on some key issues in response to the Romney team's memo. <a href=\"http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2012/08/things-wrong-with-hassett-hubbard-mankiw-and-taylor-the-romney-program-for-economic-recovery-growth-and-jobs.html\">Specifically, DeLong asks</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Why weren't HHMT [the Romney team] arguing, back in 2001-2004, either inside or outside the government, for more expansionary fiscal and monetary policies to speed the then-recovery? \u2026 Those of us who were so arguing would have found their help most welcome.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Perhaps Brad was arguing for more expansionary fiscal and monetary policies in those years, but that certainly was not the general theme coming from the Democratic side of the aisle. Most of the Democratic leadership was complaining about the size of the Bush tax cuts, which, we were told endlessly, \"blew a hole in the deficit\". (Don't ask me what that means.)</p> <p>There were also complaints about fighting the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan without paying for them. (Note the complaint was about <em>not paying</em> for the wars; not about why we were fighting them in the first place.) Both of these complaints were that Bush's fiscal policies were <em>too</em> expansionary \u2013 the exact opposite of the complaint that Brad now voices: that they were <em>not expansionary enough</em>.</p> <p>As far as monetary policy goes, <a href=\"http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2005/08/dean_baker_is_n.html\">Brad was a self-described Greenspan worshipper</a>, a view he expressed quite openly again, two years later, in <a href=\"http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2007/09/los-angeles-tim.html\">his rave review of Greenspan's autobiography</a>. If he had complaints that Greenspan's monetary policy was insufficiently expansionary in the years 2001-2004, he certainly did not express them at the time.</p> <p>Brad has previously made atonements for some of his prior positions and he deserves credit for being one of the most open-minded macroeconomists around with serious standing in the mainstream of the profession. The point here is not to beat up on him for changing his mind.</p> <p>However, there are some fundamental issues raised by Brad's criticisms of the Romney team that deserve exploring. It would be great if it became the accepted view among Democrats that the fiscal and monetary policy in the years 2001-2004 were insufficiently expansionary. The real problem was that the economy in the Clinton years was driven by a stock bubble. When that bubble collapsed, just as when the housing bubble collapsed in 2007-2008, there was no obvious source of demand to make up the shortfall.</p> <p>In the short term, only the government can fill the gap \u2013 with large-scale deficit spending, larger than what we have actually seen following both downturns. The Federal Reserve can play a supporting role with quantitative easing and other extraordinary measures.</p> <p>In the longer term, the only way to fill the demand gap is by bringing down the trade deficit, which requires a lower-valued dollar. In a world in which many countries deliberately prop up the dollar in order to run large surpluses with the United States, the value of the dollar is only likely to be reduced through deliberate and explicit policy. In other words, the government and the Fed must pursue a conscious policy of making US goods more competitive internationally, by bringing down the value of the dollar.</p> <p>Is this the view that Brad now holds of the way out of the current downturn? If so, he would be a valuable ally to have in this struggle, especially if he can convince people like Larry Summers of the merits of this position. In that case, Governor Romney's team might well deserve some of the credit for bringing him around.</p>",
  "<p>It is hard to believe that the timing of moves by Egypt's president, Mohamed Morsi, to purge senior officers from the military and impose his power was purely coincidental. It was the 23rd day of Ramadan, the evening of the Night of Power, during which the Qur'an was first revealed to the Prophet Muhammad.</p> <p>The Qur'an states that the Night of Power \"is better than a thousand months\" \u2013 this seems apt considering that these changes seemingly put an end to many months of confusion about where power lies in the new Egypt.</p> <p>But is it for the better? And where does power lie now?</p> <p>Within the military, it is clear that the new figure of power is Abdel-Fatah el-Sissi, formerly head of military intelligence and now the minister of defence. </p> <p>Considerably younger that Hussein Tantawi, the ageing general he replaced who was first appointed by Hosni Mubarak in 1992, Sissi brings with him several younger officers. His ascension puts an end to a months-long power struggle over who is in control of the military.</p> <p>The lack of an immediate challenge to Sunday's moves suggests that, essentially, there has been a successful coup within the military, in alliance with Morsi. We also know this new military leadership is willing to give Morsi the powers their predecessors had refused him \u2013 Morsi could not have regained control without their help. This speaks not of a triumphant civilian president getting the generals in line, but of a confluence of interests. It does not tell us whether it will last, or where the balance of power lies.</p> <p>Recent events, notably the deadly assault by terrorists on an Egyptian border guard outpost in Sinai last week, provided the opportunity for Morsi and his uniformed allies to move against the army's old guard. The removal of Tantawi and other officers had been preceded by the sacking of the head of the intelligence services, a surprising move in itself. But it was an opportune event more than a cause in itself, as the limbo prevailing since Morsi's election, which had been robbed of its significance by last-minute changes to Egypt's interim constitution that had effectively made Tantawi a UN-elected co-president, could not last.</p> <p>Not only has the confusion over where official power lies been partly resolved, but efforts by anti-Morsi forces to push the military into deposing him (increasingly vocally expressed in the media) now seem moot.</p> <p>We do not know, however, what will come next. Morsi now has quasi-dictatorial powers in the absence of a parliament. Retired officers have been given golden parachutes and it is unlikely that they will be held accountable, as many revolutionaries demand, for the dozens of deaths and thousands of arbitrary military trials that took place under their watch.</p> <p>The prospect of a military-Islamist alliance is a chilling one, particularly considering the disarray of the secular opposition, who, as much as they support civilian rule, now worry about an Islamist power-grab.</p> <p>Much will depend on what Morsi does next. He has a responsibility to bring together a fractured country behind a consensual constitution and new parliamentary elections.</p> <p>He must balance the desires of his own Islamist camp with the fears of secularists, the demands for reform of revolutionaries with the conservatism of his new allies in the military. There is no excuse for lack of action, now that Morsi is finally empowered.</p> <p><em>Issandr El Amrani is a writer and analyst on Middle Eastern affairs.

  "<p>When I was a teenager, my American girlfriend at the time gave me Ayn Rand's cult novel Atlas Shrugged to read. It changed her life, she said. It changed mine, too. She was not my girlfriend by the morning. It was the most unpleasant thing I'd ever had the misfortune to read.</p> <p>As a work of literature, Atlas Shrugged is drivel, and not simply because it is so up itself with its own perceived radicalism; fundamentally, all propaganda is drivel, even if it is propaganda in a good cause. Rand's cause was to celebrate what she called \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/05/new-right-ayn-rand-marx\" title=\"\">the virtue of selfishness</a>\", to denigrate the poor as scroungers and to celebrate the muscular individualism of the creative heroes of capitalism. Altruism, she contends, is \"complete evil\". The question she poses: what would happen if all the bankers and captains of industry went on strike? What would happen if these Atlas-like gods, who hold up the world, decided one day to shrug and refuse to support everyone else? Then the world would be buggered, she contends. Atlas Shrugged is cheap pornography for the nastiest side of capitalism.</p> <p>\"The reason I got involved in public service, by and large, if I had to credit one thinker, one person, it would be Ayn Rand,\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/11/paul-ryan-mitt-romney-vp-live?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">said Mitt Romney's now running mate</a> Paul Ryan <a href=\"http://www.atlassociety.org/ele/blog/2012/04/30/paul-ryan-and-ayn-rands-ideas-hot-seat-again\" title=\"\">four years ago</a>. He also admitted he made all his interns read Atlas Shrugged, dishing them out as Christmas presents.</p> <p>But here's the political problem for Ryan. Many were queasy when George Bush cheesily described Jesus as his favourite philosopher, but at least he knew his market. In contrast, few books can be as hostile to the Christian faith as Atlas Shrugged. For Rand, the good Samaritan was not simply a chump: he was in fact doing something wicked. We are saved only by selfishness. So how can an American politician, who has described himself as a \"staunch Catholic\" and in what is supposed to be an electorate dominated by Christian values, side with one who so thoroughly rejected all the teachings of Jesus?</p> <p>Ryan has now <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/297023/ryan-shrugged-robert-costa\" title=\"\">predictably backtracked</a>. \"I reject her philosophy. It's an atheist philosophy. If somebody is going to try to paste a person's view on epistemology to me, then give me Thomas Aquinas.\" By the way, this is the same Thomas Aquinas who insisted that, \"Man should not consider his material possession his own, but as common to all, so as to share them without hesitation when others are in need,\" thus espousing the very collectivism that Rand so loathed.</p> <p>Words are cheap, especially on the campaign trail. By your deeds shall you know them. And Ryan's deeds, and in particular his budget plan for slashing the role of the state, are pure Rand, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/a/theguardian.com/document/d/1JRLM7Jh9PnrxptafWYENXdAmxnXd4gQJMYTu3H4TFHA/edit?pli=1\" title=\"\">as a group of Jesuits from Georgetown University have insisted</a>: \"Your budget appears to reflect the values of your favourite philosopher, Ayn Rand, rather than the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Her call to selfishness and her antagonism toward religion are antithetical to the Gospel values of compassion and love.\" The US Catholic bishops' conference, not well-known for its progressive politics, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/paul-ryans-faith-based-lesson/2012/04/27/gIQAH76TlT_story.html\" title=\"\">has said much the same</a>.</p> <p>It feels odd to be arguing that there ought to be more religion in US politics. In many ways, I'd prefer there to be a lot less. And certainly a lot less of the hard-right hogwash that borrows the wardrobe of Christianity but has no intention of being subject to its moral values. Jesus said nothing whatsoever about homosexuality or abortion. He said a great deal about poverty and our responsibility for the vulnerable. Which is why Paul Ryan is little more than Ayn Rand in Christian drag.</p> <p>Ironically, he is a \"second-hander\" \u2013 Rand's terminology for those who take their values, pr\u00eat-\u00e0-porter, from others. The trouble is that Christianity in the US has become so widely hijacked by the right that not enough people will actually notice. As the Ryan case aptly demonstrates, the Christian right is neither: that is, Christian nor right.</p>",

  "<p>While Syria's civil war dominates the world's attention, less dramatic and telegenic events in Egypt retain the power to decide if popular uprisings will succeed in establishing a democratic alternative to tyranny in the Arab world.</p> <p>Something of that magnitude has just happened in Cairo. Arguably it is just as significant as the ousting of Hosni Mubarak in February last year. The system was decapitated but continued in the form of the military council, which assumed transitional rule. On Sunday the heads of that system, which has dominated Egypt for decades, were toppled \u2013 apparently with its acquiescence.</p> <p>In forcing the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/12/egyptian-defence-chief-ousted-shakeup\" title=\"\">departure of his defence minister and Hussein Tantawi, the head of Scaf (the Supreme Council of Armed Forces</a> ), President Mohamed Morsi was not just getting rid of an ageing field marshall who had been central to the Mubarak era, and replacing him with the youngest member of Scaf, establishing the continuity of the system. He was changing the balance of power.</p> <p>Morsi got rid of the man who was expected to replace Tantawi \u2013 the army chief of staff, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/12/mohamed-morsi-orders-generals-retire?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">Sami Enan</a> \u2013 as well as the leader of every service of the armed forces. Tantawi's replacement, the head of military intelligence Abdel-Fatah el-Sissi, will now report to Morsi himself, not to Scaf. Further, Morsi annulled the constitutional power grab that Scaf made on the second day of the presidential election in June, which gave the military a right of veto over the new constitution that is in the process of being drawn up.</p> <p>Accused by the left and liberals of political weakness, of cohabiting with the military, the Muslim Brotherhood president today stands accused of the opposite contention \u2013 accruing too much power. And it is true, that in assuming for himself the power Scaf had to appoint a new constituent assembly should the current one writing the constitution fail to agree, the Egyptian president now has the powers of a Russian one. But Morsi is no Vladimir Putin.</p> <p>First, the powers Morsi has assumed are time-limited. The constitution is already mostly written, and should be finished by early September. Its work will be put to a referendum, and within two months of that, there will be fresh parliamentary elections. Morsi's vast powers as president will only last for three months at the most before he puts his actions to the test of a popular vote.</p> <p>Second, to ensure that the vote is indeed popular, Morsi appointed two brothers, both respected judges who are independent of the Brotherhood: Mahmoud Mekky, a senior judge, is now his vice-president, and Ahmed Mekky is his justice minister. The Mekky brothers are part of the Reform Movement within the judiciary, and its agenda is to roll back the powers of the second arm of the Mubarak military state \u2013 its politically appointed constitutional court. Both men were part of the so-called judge's revolt after the tainted Mubarak elections in 2005. Civil society and the rule of law could not have two better non-Islamist champions.</p> <p>Of course, a darker interpretation can be put on Morsi's actions. If the constituent assembly cannot agree on a constitution, Morsi has the power to appoint a new one. He could also continue to rule by decree. Some analysts are pessimistic about what they see as the Brotherhood's sense of electoral entitlement.</p> <p>That may indeed exist below the democratic patina of these declarations. But doubters should ask themselves what the alternative is, given that the role of the transition is to establish a new civil order, with the military back in its barracks. Shortly after Scaf issued its constitutional decree in June, a broad coalition of the opposition met in the Fairmont Hotel in Cairo and issued a declaration promising to undo Scaf's move. Morsi is now fulfilling this.</p> <p>The test of the power he now holds will be his ability to share it with other constituencies who are suspicious of the Brotherhood \u2013 Christians, secularists, liberals, the left \u2013 and establish the effective government the country so desperately needs. For the moment, Morsi should be given the benefit of the doubt.</p>",
  "<h2>SINGH WHEN YOU'RE WINNING</h2> <p>Shebby Singh is Blackeye Rovers' \"global adviser\". Repeat: global adviser. You may well wonder why Rovers should be putting so much effort into global affairs when recent evidence suggests they can't even figure out what to do on their own pitch, and that would be a pretty decent question from the Fiver's point of view. The playing surface at Ewood Park, at 115x76 yards, represents a little over one thousand millionth of one per cent of the world's surface area. That is to say, a very tiny minority of the entirety of what Shebby Singh is advising them about. And he can't even get that right.</p> <p>Still, at least there's mathematics. Discussing the forthcoming season with a few hundred supporters at Blakey's Cafe Bar in King George's Hall on Saturday, Singh concluded that Rovers manager, Steve Kean-out, would \"definitely\" be sacked if the season starts poorly. \"For me, it's about results. For me, after three games if we dropped nine points, we would quite literally only have a 50% chance of getting promoted,\" he declared. For the Fiver, after three games if they dropped nine points, they would quite literally have almost exactly the same chance of going up as they did at the beginning. They would still have another 129 points to play for. Relax a little.</p> <p>Then there was the recently transfer-listed Morten Gamst Pedersen. Singh pronounced that he had \"lost his legs\", was \"past his sell-by date\" and was \"quite literally of no use\". This is a player the club is currently trying to sell for the maximum possible fee. In terms of advertising, he seems more of the Ratner &amp; Ruin school than Saatchi &amp; Saatchi. And matters got worse when his remarks were reported in the Lancashire Telegraph. Had the Fiver been present we would have found it impossible to resist quizzing Singh on Mitt Romney's selection of Paul Ryan as running mate, or the forthcoming changes to the line-up of popular Antipodean-based pre-school pop outfit the Wiggles, or the forest fires smouldering in Spain. He is, after all, a global adviser, and should be on top of these things.</p> <p>But this morning he had his own fires to put out. After all, the manager was furious and the players were too, and so Singh was forced to \"sincerely\" apologise to Kean and Pedersen. \"Some things are said in jest that don't come across like that when repeated,\" he said. So he was joking. Not wildly funny, but OK. He's no comedian. He's apologised. Singh then added: \"My blunt honesty sometimes upsets people and sometimes rubs people up the wrong way.\" So he wasn't joking. He was being bluntly honest. The man can't even apologise convincingly.</p> <p>What's clear is that Singh, for all the many great qualities the Fiver has no doubt he offers to Blackeye Rovers, needs someone to advise him from time to time. But who advises a global adviser? Expect the position of universal advisor to be advertised soon. Possibly not in the Lancashire Telegraph.</p> <h2>QUOTE OF THE DAY No1</h2> <p><strong>8 January 2011:</strong> \"I was going to call him a sewer rat, but that might insult the sewer rats.

Sure, but <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?sid=aOA_diQwFpDc&amp;pid=newsarchive\">that's just because they're \"running scared\"</a>, argues the Bloomberg News columnist Caroline Baum; Ed Morrissey at Hot Air agrees that they're plainly driven by <a href=\"http://hotair.com/archives/2008/09/03/the-reason-for-the-palin-bashing-in-the-media/\">\"fear\"</a>. Ryan is nothing less than <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/republicans/2683692/Sarah-Palin-is-the-new-Margaret-Thatcher-and-Ronald-Reagan.html\">Ronald Reagan reborn</a>.</p> <p>Romney's \"bold pick\" is all the more exciting, <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/168460/sarah-palin/yuval-levin\">writes the conservative thinktanker Yuval Levin</a>, because of the way the candidate \"did an extraordinary job keeping a lid on this choice\" until the last minute. The National Review blogger Kathryn Jean Lopez approvingly <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/168479/mitt-sarah/kathryn-jean-lopez\">quotes Romney</a> describing Ryan as \"a Washington outsider with a commitment to the conservative principles that will make our nation stronger\".</p> <p>Above all, the Ryan pick reframes the election as a fundamental clash of ideologies. \"The country now has a clear choice,\" says <a href=\"http://www.nrlc.org/press_releases_new/Release082908.html\">one leading conservative campaigner</a>; a Wall Street Journal commentator <a href=\"http://articles.marketwatch.com/2008-10-02/news/30708627_1_sarah-palin-democrat-joe-biden-train-wreck\">adds</a> that the selection emphasises \"the diametrically opposed directions [in which] each party wants to take the country\".</p> <p>All of which explains why, back at the National Review, Andrew McCarthy is elated. Ryan \"is just <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/168455/well-done-sen-mccain-andrew-c-mccarthy\">a superb, superb pick</a>\", he writes. The right \"<a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/168526/palin-pros-cons-andrew-c-mccarthy\">can now in good conscience give itself\" to the Romney candidacy \"with enthusiasm</a> \u2013 not feigned enthusiasm, real enthusiasm \u2013 for the first time\".</p> <p><strong>Correction:</strong> I've just realised that all the links in the paragraphs above are actually to elated conservatives welcoming John McCain's choice of Sarah Palin as his running-mate in August 2008. Paul Ryan is no Sarah Palin, for a million reasons. Still, perhaps it's worth remembering that immediate partisan reactions to vice-presidential running-mate announcements are not a very good guide to anything at all \u2026</p>",
  "<p>Is it all over yet? I must confess that I fell asleep several times during Sunday night's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2012/aug/12/london-2012-closing-ceremony-pictures\" title=\"\">Olympic closing ceremony</a>, which went on a bit too long. At various points I became convinced that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/13/olympic-games-closing-ceremony-culture\" title=\"\">great pagan pop festival</a> was about to end. But no, Rio's carnival crew popped up to give us a taster for 2016 (I think they'll manage) and the final speeches gave way to Take That or The Who. Was that Darcey Bussell? What was she doing there with the old rockers?</p> <p>But I'm falling into a familiar trap: carping about a creatively chaotic conclusion to a magnificently well organised and enjoyable global celebration, which Britain hosted in great style. I can only find one half-hearted whinge (is it a record?) in today's coverage in the Daily Mail (two if you count the \"What was druggie Kate Moss doing there?\" article). Moss-bashing is a Mail campaign.</p> <p>I <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/jun/01/britain-olympic-gold-moaning\" title=\"\">complained about this </a>six weeks ago when the gloomsters were working themselves up into a lather about everything going wrong. In the event only G4S, the private sector security contractor, really screwed up, only to have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jul/24/london-2012-olympics-g4s-military\" title=\"\">the armed forces step in</a> and become the unplanned hit of the Games.</p> <p>As usual, most of the cynics and miserablists turned out to be closet sentimentalists who went overboard in the opposite direction once they spotted they'd backed the wrong horse this time. So I was both appalled and impressed that <a href=\"http://hitchensblog.mailonsunday.co.uk/2012/08/if-you-believe-that-olympic-glory-makes-a-nation-great-just-remember-the-ussr.html\" title=\"\">Mail on Sunday columnist, Peter (brother of Christopher) Hitchens</a>, was willing to appear on Radio 4's Today on Monday morning to denounce the closing ceremony as a \"moronic inferno\".</p> <p>What's more, said Hitchens, it was proof that the Christian monarchy we used to inhabit has been overthrown by what I think he called \"New Labour totalitarianism\", underpinned by pop music. Reactionaries always think this way, the decline from past glory is a form of romanticism, though they mistake it for realism.</p> <p>Hitchens's Larkin-esque tirade includes you, Boris and Dave: Hitchens says you're both enslaved by the New Labour zeitgeist and that George Osborne calls Tony Blair \"The Master\". Incidentally, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/13/politicians-success-london-olympics\" title=\"\">Blair was annoying in his own way</a> on the same Radio 4 show, but has the merit of being cheerful. His interpretation of the message of the London Games was that modern Britain is about diversity within common and shared core values.</p> <p>Let's hope he's right, since there's no visible alternative. The hard task now as we return to the day job, complete with hangover recession and the rest, is realistically to assess how best the feel-good legacy of the Games can be exploited for the common good \u2013 from urban regeneration to healthier kids and revitalised tourism \u2013 without going completely barking in the opposite direction of Peter Hitchens in proclaiming a new Britain has been born this past 16 days, or that an old one has been re-born.</p> <p>I'll serve up Tory MEP Dan Hannan's, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-2184689/Multiculturalism-Nonsense-The-Olympics-victory-patriotism-common-British-values.html\" title=\"\">blowhard article in last week's Mail, </a>which asserted that Team GB's triumph and the nation's mood were not vindications of multiculturalism or New Labour collectivism, but of the competitive spirit and deeply held voluntary traditions.</p> <p>It's no worse than many others of the genre. Desperate Dan \u2013 whom I love to tease as \"Peruvian-born Dan\" during his uber-patriotic outbursts \u2013 makes some good points, though claiming that the Games vindicate Norman Tebbit's famous \"cricket test\" is stretching it a bit. But the other side has good points to make, too.</p> <p>As Martin Ivens fairly explained in the Sunday Times, \"the Tories have a guilty past\", those 10,000 playing fields sold off under Maggie and Major, that vital funding and PE targets recently slashed by Michael Gove. Like most of life's endeavours, achievement is usually a mixture of co-operation and competition. Was it not Isaac Newton who said \"If I have seen further than other men it is because I have stood on the shoulders of giants\", in much the same way that athletes have paced each other and generously praised each other in victory and defeat these past two weeks?</p> <p>If Premier League footballers, foul-mouthed, over-paid louts that too many of them are, can capture half the spirit in the coming season we will all be better off. It is not true that \"nice guys finish last\". If it was, our footballers really would be world beaters.</p> <p>The awkward fact is that, just as Labour once sanctioned a lot of nonsense about the unhealthy nature of competition (those of us never picked for the team get the point, though it's wrong), so many conservatives kid themselves that it's all about liberating people from the burdensome state. The state is there to protect and nurture. It is all about proper boundaries.</p> <p>I heard usually risk-averse Mitt Romney's new running mate, Paul Ryan, banging on about the wicked state last night. That should scare floating American voters. Obama may not be a great president, but he is a lucky one. It was Jess Ennis who thrived in Sheffield's publicly funded sports facilities, the gracious Ennis too who gently told an interviewer that young athletes shouldn't be forced to compete too young.</p> <p>So the politicians will use their autumn conference speeches to claim that the London Olympics vindicate their own vision of 21st-century Britain; they will make both valid claims and dud ones. We need not listen to them too hard. Mo Farah is more fun to listen too and more gracious. He also seems very smart. Nice guys sometimes do surmount setbacks and come first. Not many, alas, but enough to cheer us all up at the prospect.</p> <p>In summary, just that may be the real legacy of the London Games: a surge of enjoyable happiness, which has embraced some people who had expected to be indifferent. Even without the Bank of England's Eeyore, Mervyn King, (silver medalist to Peter Hitchens's gold?), warning everyone that the halo effect may not do much for the economy, history suggests the economic benefit is likely to be modest.</p> <p>We can't be sure. David Cameron's upbeat prediction may be right after all. But there's a lot to be said for a cheering-up in hard times, even an expensive one like this. It's been the biggest mood-changer since the Falklands war (also costly) in 1982, a retired general told the Times letters column today.</p> <p>That's an interesting comparison, a reminder that this country seems to pull the stops out and perform really well when its back is against the wall. So it's good to see a nation (four nations if you prefer) looking at ease with itself and be reminded that the things which unite us remain powerful and generous in spirit on occasion.</p> <p>Me, I love the idea of the golden post boxes being repainted in Olympiads' neighbourhoods. Daft but nice. Back in the real world the economy is still flat-lining and the bills must be paid, Syria is still bleeding, the polar ice cap is melting faster than we feared and <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2187422/A-bride-41-John-Cleese-72--years-marriage-No-3-ended-12m-divorce.html\" title=\"\">John Cleese has just remarried </a>for the fourth time. As the nights draw in and queues return to Heathrow, it's surely best to remember Mo's beam. Those golden post boxes should help.</p>",

  "<p>At a meeting with a group of Colombian NGOs the other day, a political analyst summed up the mission of Juan Manuel Santos, who is completing two years as president of Colombia this week, in two words: modernisation and decency. These two words could hardly be applied to Santos's predecessor, hardliner Alvaro Uribe, many of whose <a href=\"http://www.abcolombia.org.uk/subpage.asp?subid=427&amp;mainid=75\" title=\"\">closest family and advisers have been linked to the murderous narco-paramilitary groups</a>.</p> <p>When I asked Santos a couple of months ago why Uribe <a href=\"http://www.caracol.com.co/noticias/actualidad/video-muestra-enojo-y-arremetida-de-uribe-contra-santos-via-twitter/20120519/nota/1691027.aspx\" title=\"\">keeps savaging him on Twitter</a> despite the fact that their signature policies seem so similar, his answer was revealing: \"I often ask myself the same question.\" From his economic and social policies \u2013 attract foreign skills and investment to expand natural resource exports to pay for social investments: the classic neoliberal package \u2013 to his attitude to the guerrillas, which he <a href=\"http://www.elespectador.com/noticias/paz/articulo-350574-mas-plomo-contra-farc-santos\" title=\"\">recently summarised as \"more lead\"</a>, he seems to be following where Uribe led. That is certainly how it looks to many of his critics on the left.</p> <p>But his drive to be modern and decent has imbued these policies with a subtle rebalancing. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-18882551\" title=\"\">Recent pictures of indigenous people removing armed soldiers from their land</a> surprised the country \u2013 Uribe tweeted that this was a breakdown of law and order. But for some it demonstrated the difference between the two men. Where Uribe would probably have ordered the troops to fight back, Santos accepted a limited humiliation of the armed forces in the name of decency. I remember hearing the first radio announcements by the Santos government endorsing the importance of human rights defenders and thinking: \"Santos is going to be different.\" Uribe never lost an opportunity to harangue and undermine those working on human rights, often <a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/news/2009/02/05/letter-president-uribe-recent-statements-about-journalist-hollman-morris\" title=\"\">accusing them of complicity with terrorism</a>. Perhaps most blatantly, the diplomatic attitude Santos shows towards the Venezuelan president, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, despite his certainty that Ch\u00e1vez funded the Farc guerrillas, must deeply annoy Uribistas, demonstrating as it does a mature diplomatic approach to international politics.</p> <p>Lest this article be mistaken for a hagiography, let me make clear that everything is relative and that politics is often the art of the least-worst option. Santos still cares more about mining profits than the land rights of indigenous people and poor communities, and there is no sign whatsoever that the fundamentals that make Colombia one of the world's most unequal countries are being challenged \u2013 Santos's <a href=\"http://www.semana.com/nacion/santos-debe-pedir-perdon-fracaso-restitucion-engano-robledo/177914-3.aspx\" title=\"\">record on restoring land to victims of displacement is very weak</a>, despite a fairly progressive new law recognising victims' rights. While poverty is down again this year, rightly a source of pride to progressives in the government, it is still around the level it was 20 years ago \u2013 7 million Colombians live on less than $2 a day, according to the World Bank.</p> <p>But it is Santos's reverence for modernity in a world of exciting new heterodox thinking that may serve his country best, even more so than his instinct for decency. When neoliberalism was modern, Santos believed and upheld it. But Santos is a liberal, not a neoliberal. Now that neoliberalism is in history's dustbin, it is highly likely that Santos will allow his politics to be strongly influenced by new currents of economic thought, particularly those emanating from Colombia's South American neighbours. It is no coincidence that Santos refers to Colombia's inequality in almost every speech he makes, now that it is fashionable to do so, <a href=\"http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/LACEXT/0,,contentMDK:20384897~pagePK:146736~piPK:146830~theSitePK:258554,00.html\" title=\"\">with the World Bank itself leading the charge</a>. <a href=\"http://www.ukti.gov.uk/export/countries/americas/southamerica/colombia/premiumcontent/303760.html\" title=\"\">Santos's new home-building programme</a> is borrowed from Brazilian and Venezuelan success, as is his <a href=\"http://www.portafolio.co/economia/jovenes-pobres-no-estudian-no-trabajan-ni-buscan-empleo\" title=\"\">plan to pay poor young people to study</a>. Most crucially of all, if he decides to learn from the Brazilian experience of heavily investing in small farmers as a complement to mega-agroprojects, he could expect to see similar falls in hunger and poverty.</p> <p>I am even prepared to retune my critique of the <a href=\"http://www.anspe.gov.co/foro/inicio.aspx\" title=\"\">National Agency for Overcoming Extreme Poverty</a> (Anspe), which <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/poverty-matters/2012/apr/05/colombia-tackling-poverty-dent-statistics\" title=\"\">I wrote about a few months ago</a>. In May, I visited a woman for whom Anspe was the first serious contact with a poverty-focused state she has had in her lifetime (she was displaced to the outskirts of the city of Monter\u00eda, in northern Colombia, 30 years ago). Although oversold (an exit from poverty requires jobs, public services and infrastructure, not just visits from a social worker, as I said at a meeting with Anspe bosses afterwards), it is at least the first tentative step towards decent social security for the country's poorest inhabitants, and one initiated by Uribe, under whom official poverty figures also fell.</p> <p>These tweaks of an unjust system are not going to satisfy those who rightly continue to point to the grave human rights violations and land displacements, still unanswered for, which blight Colombia's polarised history. But if Santos has proved anything apart from his decency and modernity, it is that, like Brazil's ex-president, Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, he has the political nous to know the limits of the possible in a country where violence and elite power are still major factors in the political firmament.</p>"
