  "<p>It's always a pleasure to see a familiar face again and when that face is Tony Blair's and it has reappeared beneath a banner headline that includes the words \"multimillionaire\", then you know it can be only one thing: time to sit back with a cup of tea and a digestive biscuit for what will surely be another rich comedic treat.</p> <p>What this time, Tony? More news about your hilarious comeback tour? (\"I have got things to say. And if people want to listen, that's great,\" as he said in July.) Further details on your impenetrable tax affairs? To recap, last year Windrush Ventures (the trading name of the Office of T Blair) made \u00a312m, of which they decided that almost \u00a311m constituted \"<a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2083827/The-12m-tax-mystery-Tony-Blairs-earnings-soar-42--pays-315-000-HMRC.html\" title=\"\">administrative expenses</a>\". I know I shouldn't have to point this out, but Tony, you're the ex prime minister. You were, until recently, in charge of the Treasury. If you can't be arsed to give it any money, then really\u2026 oh you know, I can't even be bothered to finish this sentence. Work it out for yourself.</p> <p>In fact, it was neither of the above. Blair made the papers last week because of his ongoing, deeply felt personal commitment to social justice. Having made it his mission when he was in power to bring in a minimum wage to end the vicious capitalist exploitation of the low-waged and particularly the young, he has continued this now that he's out of office by employing young people and not paying them anything at all.</p> <p>Last week, a graduate told how he'd been offered an unpaid internship in Tony Blair's office, but had asked to work only four out of five days so that he could continue to earn money in his part-time job to support himself. He was distraught when he was told that this wouldn't be acceptable and the offer was retracted.</p> <p>A spokesman for the office of Tony Blair said: \"We do run an internship programme and value our interns very highly. Each internship lasts for around three months and is designed to give young people valuable experience in a high-profile and fast-moving work environment. We support all our interns by paying travel and lunch expenses.\"</p> <p>He's right. It is \"valuable experience\". Euan Blair, for example, managed to parlay the work experience that his daddy secured him on Capitol Hill with a congressman into a career as an investment banker with Morgan Stanley. It's hard to know whether it was nepotism, connections or that helpful glamour internship that really gave Euan the edge. But it certainly did no harm.</p> <p>Because don't underestimate how much difference these early opportunities make. Twenty years ago, when I graduated, I walked straight into my first job \u2013 as a waitress. And one of the people I waited tables on was a university contemporary of mine. Her first job, it turned out, was with a well-known national newspaper group. This one. A position she'd secured through the connections of her semi-famous family member. She's now a powerful newspaper executive. I don't think it harmed her either.</p> <p>It's become a cliche to rail at intern culture and how toxic it is, how socially exclusive it is, how it consolidates opportunities for the offspring of the moneyed and connected, but it's also true. And it's growing, burgeoning, an unstoppable tumour, smothering the few last remaining healthy cells of social mobility that we have left.</p> <p>The <em>Guardian</em> and the <em>Observer</em>, I should point out, have reformed their work experience rules, but it's the exception, not the rule. Intern culture has become so mainstream that an ex-Labour politician who championed the minimum wage feels no shame at all in defending its use.</p> <p>Oh, I know, I jest. Tony Blair and shame? In the same sentence? I find that if I'm in any sort of moral quandary, I stop and think: \"What would Tony do?\" Would it be a good idea to go on a jolly beach holiday with Silvio Berlusconi? Advise Nursultan Nazarbayev, the Kazakh dictator who's alleged to have siphoned $1bn out of his country and whose family has asset-stripped its main industries? Invade Iraq? Probably not. The rule is if you can imagine Tony Blair doing it, don't.</p> <p>Earlier this year, Blair appeared in a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-17827773\" title=\"\">video</a> that waxed lyrical about the wonders of Kazakhstan, a country that Transparency International found came 122 out of 146 for corruption, where the president won an impressive and not entirely credible 91.15% of the vote in the last election and where torture and abuse are claimed to be widespread.</p> <p>Blair had been recruited by Portland Communications, run by his former media adviser, Tim Allan. And this connection has been a wonderful work creation scheme for washed-up New Labour has-beens \u2013 Alastair Campbell has also done his bit for Kazakhstan. The fact is that Britain is now more like what Blair calls that \"bastion of stability and progress\", aka Kazakhstan.</p> <p>Or at least the Britain that Tony Blair lives in and has tried to create in his image. Nursultan Nazarbayev bequeathed state industries to his children to see them on his way. Blair broke no laws to buy three \u00a31m houses for his older offspring, but it's not a dissimilar impulse. He just wanted, like most parents, to do his best by them. To enable them to take the kind of unpaid internships that he's now providing for the children of other well-off parents. From wealth and connections come wealth and connections.</p> <p>His friends are enriched, his children set up for life and his financial affairs demonstrate the great pellucid transparency of mud. It's not quite an oligarchy, is it? But it's not a million miles off either. Britain: that other great bastion of stability and progress.</p> <p><em>Comments will be turned on later</em></p>",
  "<p>One of the first times that Marion Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen took her seat in the Assembl\u00e9e Nationale, the lower house of the French parliament, she was stopped by a male politician. \"He looked at me and said: 'And whose secretary are you?'\" says Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen.</p> <p>In June, Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen became the youngest MP in modern French history, at the age of 22, after topping the poll in her constituency of Carpentras in the south-eastern region of the Vaucluse, with 49.09% of the vote. And yet the most disconcerting thing about her victory was arguably not her youth but her politics: Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen is an MP for the Front National and the newest face of the French far right. Her grandfather, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/jean-marie-le-pen\" title=\"\">Jean-Marie Le Pen</a>, founded the political party which she now represents, a party which is anti-Europe, anti-globalisation and which believes in stringent immigration controls and national protectionism.</p> <p>\"Integration is no longer possible,\" she says. \"When you're the single French person in the middle of 10 Tunisians, the majority will impose their way of life on the minority.\"</p> <p>Blonde, slim and striking, Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen talks in a fluent and engaging manner. When we meet in her small, airless office in the headquarters of the Assembl\u00e9e Nationale in Paris, her hair is swept back in a ponytail, her clothes are fashionable but discreet: a black top with zip detailing at the shoulders, tailored beige trousers, boots with a sensible heel. In a building filled with middle-aged men in grey suits, Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen stands out.</p> <p>The fact is that she looks like a 22-year-old \u2013 albeit one in possession of an extraordinary degree of focus and ambition \u2013 and it is perhaps this that makes it difficult to believe she espouses some of the hardline views that form part of her personal and political heritage. She says she is used to people underestimating her.</p> <p>\"It happens,\" she shrugs. \"People have said I'm a puppet, an instrument of my grandfather but I think they quickly realised that I'm my own person, that I have autonomy in my actions. I think they rapidly realised I could look after myself.\"</p> <p>And yet however much she might try and distance herself from it, the Front National's grubby history casts a long shadow. Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen was born in 1989, two years after her grandfather claimed in an interview that the Nazi gas chambers were \"a point of detail of the second world war\" and six months before Front National supporters were accused of desecrating a Jewish cemetery in Carpentras, the town that would later become her constituency.</p> <p>She grew up surrounded by far-right politics in a red-brick manor house called the Pavillon de l'\u00c9cuyer in the western Paris suburb of Saint-Cloud that is home to several generations of Le Pens. Behind the rows of oak trees and conifers which shield it from public view, the house continues to play host to the entire dynasty: Jean-Marie, the 84-year-old elder statesman, presides over events and has his office on the first floor. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/marine-le-pen\" title=\"\">Marine Le Pen</a>, the youngest of his three daughters, who succeeded him as party leader last year, lives above a former stable in the extensive grounds. Marion lives with her mother, Yann, Jean-Marie's middle daughter, on the second floor of the main house. Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen's divorced parents are both heavily involved in the Front National: her mother organises the party's rallies and her father, Samuel Mar\u00e9chal, used to lead its youth movement.</p> <p>It is partly as a result of this curious setup that many have accused Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen of being little more than a photogenic figurehead for a party seeking to ditch its thuggish past in search of more mainstream credibility. There are those who question whether she genuinely believes the policies she's pitching to the wider public.</p> <p>\"She speaks rather well,\" says the French cultural commentator Agn\u00e8s Poirier, \"but a little like a law student who has memorised her dissertation.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398427507\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2012/10/26/1351254712427/Marion-Mar-chal-Le-Pen-004.jpg\" alt=\"Marion Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen\" width=\"220\" height=\"330\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marion Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen, France\u2019s youngest MP, and the latest in the family dynasty. Photograph: Rannjan Joawn/Observer New Review</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rannjan Joawn/Observer New Review</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And it is true that her presence on the political stage forms part of a broader attempt at rebranding the party. Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen's aunt, Marine, has been instrumental in dragging the image of the Front National into the modern era, moving away from racist rhetoric, reaffirming secularism and insisting that France should stand on its own two feet and leave the euro. In April 2011, Marine banned regional councillor Alexandre Gabriac from the party after a photograph of him giving the Nazi salute was leaked to the press, calling his behaviour \"intolerable\". In return, she has been rewarded with electoral success: the Front National is now the third largest party in France. When Marine stood as a candidate in the presidential elections earlier this year, she electrified the race by polling 17.9% in the first round \u2013 more than 6m votes \u2013 eventually finishing third behind Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and Nicolas Sarkozy. But it has not all been plain sailing: although her niece was elected to parliament in June, Marine Le Pen lost her bid to win a seat by 118 votes.</p> <p>The party's parliamentary hopes now rest on Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen, who is seen as an astute, media-friendly young woman capable of mobilising widespread support and reinvigorating the immigration debate. But there are those who question her own commitment, believing that she is little more than her grandfather's mouthpiece.</p> <p>According to Matthew Fraser, a professor at the American University of Paris: \"The old man [Jean-Marie] is grudgingly fading away \u2013 and it is grudging, there is talk that he misses the spotlight. He's hardly in retirement. For now, the granddaughter is an attractive and young symbol \u2013 probably not a real power in the system.\"</p> <p>I ask Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen if she discusses political strategy with her elders around the dining table in the family mansion. \"No, not at all,\" she replies. \"We are all able to have our private lives. We're lucky to have such a close family, with my grandfather and cousins around us. We're very blessed. I think because we've always been confronted by adversity from the outside so we've become closer because of that, because we've had to be a strong unit to withstand those blows.\"</p> <p>She says she first developed an interest in politics at the age of 16 and supported Sarkozy in the 2007 presidential elections. But she soon became disenchanted by him and, at the age of 19, started to help out with campaigning for the Front National and volunteered for the youth wing of the party. She combined standing as an MP with her postgraduate studies in public law and is still a student at Panth\u00e9on-Assas University, a traditionally rightwing institution. Her grandfather, a former paratrooper who also went on to study law, was himself once the youngest MP in French politics when he was elected in 1956 at the age of 28. Is he proud of her carrying on the family tradition?</p> <p>\"I think so,\" she says. \"I hope so. He is proud of those who seek to take back their heritage and is passionate about France and he's happy that young people are becoming engaged [Marion's electoral success was due in part to her popularity among voters aged 18-25]. I don't agree with everything he says, but I agree with the essential spirit and of that he's proud. What he hates most of all is inertia, people who are spectators.\"</p> <p>What, then, are her policies? She lists them, one by one, in rapid-fire \u2013 at one point, she is speaking so quickly that her adviser, Arnaud, has to remind her to slow down as French is not my first language.</p> <p>\"But dammit, I am speaking slowly!\" she protests and then carries on at the same breakneck pace. On the economy, she wants France to abandon the euro and readopt the franc. She wants tighter regulation for financial institutions in the wake of the banking crisis and lower taxes for French businesses in order to regain consumer confidence. She is vehemently anti-EU \u2013 a position that has found favour with republican French voters who believe the integrity of their nation is endangered by federal government. And she claims that the Front National has taken a truly \"feminist\" stance on maternity leave by devising a policy that would give stay-at-home parents a salary. Although, when I ask if she considers herself a feminist, she replies: \"No, not especially. I'm not obsessed with the rights of women, it can be a bit excessive. I want to put men and women on an equal footing. I think we are equal, but different.\" She is against positive discrimination or quota systems, believing that women should be treated on their own merits.</p> <p>\"Then, of course, we have our policies on immigration,\" she continues. \"More and more communities are asking for the introduction of their specific religious law and that is a threat to secularisation. It's particularly an issue among Muslim communities. Not all Muslims,\" she clarifies, hastily. \"Most Muslims in France are not fundamentalists. What is surprising is that the first generation of immigrants were very well assimilated. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/apr/10/france-burqa-law-kenza-drider\" title=\"They didn't wear the veil in public.\">They didn't wear the veil in public.</a> They kept their religion in the private sphere. Now whole immigrant communities are being created \u2013 because of past government policies \u2013 that are separate.\"</p> <p>In France, where the divorce of church from state underpinned the French revolution, secularisation is viewed as a basic tenet of the country's progressive thought. Since April 2011, women have been banned from wearing the burqa or the niqab in public. In this context, Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen's comments are not especially controversial. But then she goes even further, outlining a plan to strip second-generation immigrants of citizenship if they commit a crime&#xa0;or refuse to learn French.</p> <p>\"Today, if someone is born in France, they automatically have French nationality even if they have made no effort to integrate,\" she says. \"We believe that French people should be prioritised for social housing and employment opportunities, if they have an equal competence.\"</p> <p>But what about the \"genuine\" French? If they commit a crime, will they too be stripped of their nationality?</p> <p>\"No. We're talking about people to whom we've done a favour,\" Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen leans forward, elbows on her knees, legs apart. She maintains eye contact and talks with a kind of easy charm that could, in the right circumstances, be quite hypnotising. \"We've given them a certain number of privileges and if they haven't shown themselves to be worthy of French citizenship, then it's normal to take it back.\"</p> <p>This is all so smoothly expressed, that it takes a moment for the impact of it to hit home: that the law, under the Front National, would mean one thing for those descended from immigrants and another thing entirely for what Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen views as the \"true\" French race.</p> <p>Isn't her stance racist? \"That accusation is largely used by our opponents to discredit us. I don't see how it's racist to prioritise French nationals. We're not talking about black or white. It's normal that French people who pay taxes should be prioritised, just as an Algerian who is naturalised will have priority [in social housing and employment].\"</p> <p>She points out that people from Martinique, for example, would not be subject to the proposed nationality restrictions because the Caribbean island is an officially designated region of France and goes on to name a number of Front National members from ethnic minority backgrounds, including Charlotte Soula, the office manager of Marine Le Pen who is of Algerian origin (and a convert from Islam to Catholicism).</p> <p>\"The racism argument is a very violent one but it works less and less,\" says Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen. \"Now, on the ground, people don't think it any more of us. They understand it's a political tactic. Most people think we're right.</p> <p>\"It's a debate that stirs up emotions, of course it is. It's hard to talk about it because of the human dimension that affects people. We are not monsters. I have empathy, I am humane, I understand human misery. My grandfather always said: 'Don't be angry at the immigrants, be angry at the political class that created this situation.' I've nothing against people who come to France in search of a better life. If France had the means to welcome everyone, we would. We have that history [of tolerance]. But we don't have the means. We are in debt. Our welfare system is melting under the pressure. We have a colossal deficit. It's sad but we have to have the political courage to say 'stop'. And it's sad because, when we say 'stop', we are saying it to a man or a woman, but there we go.\"</p> <p>Immigration, she concedes, \"has also been good\" for France. The problem, as she sees it, is that past government policies have failed, causing resentment among those who believe their country is being overrun by \"outsiders\". She goes on to claim that a number of Muslim women, who feel pressurised into wearing the veil within their communities, are also supportive of her position.</p> <p>\"There are women who say to me, 'I can't wear a skirt,' or 'I'll be insulted if I don't wear a veil or don't go to the mosque.' There's a pressure within the community imposed by others. Those people, more and more, are calling on us to act because we are the only ones who see secularism as fundamentally important.\"</p> <p>Is the Front National becoming a political force to be reckoned with in France? The election of Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen in June, alongside fellow party candidate Gilbert Collard, gave the party a foothold in parliament for the first time since the mid-1980s, but the first-past-the-post electoral system is still weighted against smaller parties. As a result, the popularity of the Front National \u2013 especially in impoverished, semi-urbanised rural areas where unemployment is high \u2013 might be far more ingrained than the electoral results suggest.</p> <p>As Hugh Schofield, a BBC news correspondent based in Paris, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17824436\" title=\"\">wrote in an article last April</a>: \"In this semi-urbanised countryside, people feel the hopelessness of a life in poverty uncompensated-for by the traditions and structures that would have made it bearable in the past.</p> <p>\"Shops are now in vast out-of-town zones; no one goes to church; work is a 50km drive away. And the cost of the two staples \u2013 cigarettes and petrol \u2013 has just shot through the roof.</p> <p>\"For these people, a Front National vote offers both a protest (against the wealthy; against the EU; against the establishment), but also a claim: for an identity and the right to a traditional 'French' way of life.\"</p> <p>In urban areas, too, there are fears about mass immigration \u2013 fears that were heightened by the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2005_civil_unrest_in_France\" title=\"\">2005 riots</a> by mostly French youths of north African origin from the suburbs of Paris and other major cities. The riots highlighted chronic tensions caused by immigration and unemployment and the mainstream parties began to adopt the rhetoric of the Front National. Sarkozy, who was interior minister at the time, referred to the rioters as <em>racaille</em> or scum \u2013 a term viewed by some as having implicitly racist connotations.</p> <p>\"Sarkozy won in 2007 by shifting to the right and stealing FN votes,\" explains Matthew Fraser. \"In that sense, [Jean-Marie] Le Pen was ahead of his time \u2013 whether his views are despicable or not is a moral question, but what is certain is that they are electorally popular. And his adversaries understand this. Hence the paradox: they pretend the FN is ideologically unfrequentable, yet they steal the party's discourse and platforms to get elected. It's rather like borrowing someone's house to throw a party, but not inviting the owner.\"</p> <p>France has a long history with the far right which has traditionally been allied with the Catholic church (even the former president Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was, as a young man, involved in conservative nationalist movements) and Marine Le Pen's attempts to decontaminate the image of the FN have not been without success. \"Today, the reality is that the extreme right is against us,\" she claimed in an interview for <em>The Nation</em> last year. \"The National Front has evolved.\"</p> <p>Despite a recent groundswell of support in provincial France, however, the party is still viewed with outright distaste among the Parisian chattering classes.</p> <p>\"In France it is acceptable, even fashionable, to espouse far-left political convictions, but absolutely unacceptable to belong to the far right,\" says Fraser. \"The explanation is largely historical. France has been living with the shame of the Nazi collaboration under the Vichy regime, after which the far right was marginalised from what are considered to be acceptable political values in France.\"</p> <p>And there are those who caution against believing that a leopard can change its spots. Alain Jakubowicz, the president of <a href=\"http://www.licra.org/\" title=\"\">Licra</a>, the international league against racism and antisemitism, puts it this way: \"Today, the party is represented by a young woman with a modern and normal appearance [but] the FN remains the same, with its xenophobic, racist and antisemitic DNA.\"</p> <p>Back in her office, Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen insists that the Front National's transformation is not simply a superficial public relations exercise.</p> <p>\"Of course the party has evolved,\" she says. \"The problems are no longer the same, so evolution has happened naturally\u2026 When the Front National was created in the 1970s it was against the background of communism and the cold war. It was a real threat, now it's no longer the case\u2026 Now our main hobby-horse is anti-globalisation.\"</p> <p>She insists that she has only ever encountered \"a positive reaction\" on the street. \"Even people who don't share my politics, they say: 'I'm not Front National but I'm happy you're there because it creates debate.'\"</p> <p>Arnaud, her adviser, helpfully interrupts at this point to remind her that she recently went to a fashionable Parisian restaurant and was given a spontaneous round of applause by the diners. Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen looks embarrassed.</p> <p>\"The owner was very kind and he took me around and said: 'Tonight we're welcoming Mademoiselle Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen,' and everyone clapped,\" she says hurriedly. \"It was really kind.\"</p> <p>Does she ever receive hate mail?</p> <p>\"I've had one letter.\"</p> <p>Arnaud interjects. \"But if I get out all the ones that say how marvellous you are, how beautiful, there's no comparison,\" he gushes.</p> <p>It seems incredible that she has only ever had one piece of negative mail. I tell her that in the UK, journalists get more than that in any given week.</p> <p>\"The most aggressive people are other MPs,\" she says. \"Some of them are very aggressive, even though we've all been democratically elected.\" Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Cop\u00e9, the leader of the centre-right UMP party, has in the past refused to shake her hand. \"He might refuse to shake my hand, but his electors will gladly do so,\" is her response. Spoken like a true politician.</p> <p>I can see why Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen is electable. In person, she has an engaging, accessible manner. There is the occasional glimpse of humour \u2013 when we are talking about her party's maternity leave policies, the subject of children comes up. Does she want a family? She guffaws. \"Yes, if I can find a suitable sperm donor.\"</p> <p>At the same time, I find her charisma unsettling because it is being deployed in the defence of some dubious beliefs. As the interview draws to a close, I tell her I have one final question and it's a personal one. She nods, encouraging me to go on.</p> <p>I am married to a man whose father came to the UK from Sudan, I say. If he lived in France under a Front National government, my husband would therefore fall into that category of second-generation immigrants who would have to prove deserving of a citizenship automatically conferred on others. Given this, I wonder what her position is on marriages between people from different backgrounds?</p> <p>Maybe it's because I'm expecting a reaction that I think I see a slight flinch in her face. It is a tiny movement: the expression of someone who has effectively masked their surprise.</p> <p>\"I'm not against it,\" she replies. \"For me, marriage is a very personal choice. The only thing&#xa0;I'd say is that I know, from people who've told me firsthand, that sadly mixed marriages can be a bit conflicted on everyday issues. For instance, the naming of children \u2013 Muslims need children to take Muslim names, often they want women to convert to Islam. The other surprising thing is that often, in a divorce, north African fathers take their children back to their country and the mother never sees them again. That causes problems. I don't judge, but it can cause conflict.\"</p> <p>And yet she has judged, making a series of sweeping assumptions on the basis of very little actual knowledge about a particular set of personal circumstances. Perhaps Mar\u00e9chal-Le Pen is right that immigration needs to be discussed and that MPs are wary of doing so in case they are accused of racism. Some of her opinions have the sheen of plausibility. She is not unlikable. But the tone of her last answer suggests a more disturbing set of beliefs at play beneath the surface: a whiff of something rotten at the core of her politics and a sense that the world is made up of people who can be divided easily into \"us\" or \"them\".</p> <p><strong>A family business: the Le Pen dynasty</strong></p> <h2><strong>Jean-Marie Le Pen</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398427508\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pixies/2012/10/26/1351256209846/Jean-Marie-Le-Pen-003.jpg\" alt=\"Jean-Marie Le Pen\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: Chamussy/Sipa/Rex Features</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chamussy/Sipa/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>1928 </strong>Born 20 June in Brittany, the son of a fisherman.</p> <p><strong>1972</strong> Le Pen co-founds the Front National and presides over it for nearly 40 years.</p> <p><strong>1984</strong> Becomes an MEP.</p> <p><strong>1987</strong> Is found guilty of violating French law and fined 1.2m francs (\u00a3150,000) for remarks concerning the presence of gas chambers in Nazi concentration camps.

  "<p>On 22 September 2012, President Barack Obama enjoyed, according to <a href=\"http://www.pollster.com/polls/\" title=\"\">Pollster.com</a>, his largest popular vote lead in the US presidential election campaign, post convention season. He was up by four points in the national polls, had a six point advantage in the crucial swing state of Ohio, a narrow three point lead in Florida and a near four point advantage in Virginia.</p> <p>The popular election forecasting website <a href=\"http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/search/label/today%27s%20polls\" title=\"\">fivethirtyeight.com </a>predicted that Obama had a 77.5% chance of winning the election, a number that would rise to as high as 87.1% by 4 October. The improvement in Obama's poll numbers was not necessarily that surprising. On 17 September, the liberal magazine <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Mother Jones</em></a> released a devastating video tape that showed Republican candidate Mitt Romney dismissing the 47% of the country that he claimed were \"dependent on government\" and who refused, he said, to take \"personal responsibility and care for their lives\".</p> <p>The tape was practically confirmation of a key Obama campaign line of attack against Romney \u2013 that he was a wealthy man with no empathy or concern for the plight of the poor and the working class. As a recent Obama ad running in Ohio suggested, the tape appeared to imply he was \"not one of us\".</p> <p>To many political observers, the election was all but over; a flawed and less than competent Republican candidate appeared simply unable to take advantage of an underperforming economy to dislodge a relatively unpopular president. Few pundits could see much of a way in which Romney might be able to stop the bleeding.</p> <p>Then Obama and Romney met in the first <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2012/oct/04/first-presidential-debate-video-highlights\" title=\"\">presidential debate</a> of the 2012 campaign and everything changed \u2013 or so it seemed. Romney's public image had been so badly hurt by an onslaught of Obama's negative ads that he came into the debate needing only to deliver a slightly better than average performance to spur a reconsideration of his candidacy. Romney exceeded those low expectations at the same that his opponent badly under-performed his.</p> <p>There is a recurrent pattern in presidential debates that an incumbent, rusty from not having debated in four years, loses the first meeting between the candidates. Obama's performance would have been bad if he had merely lost; instead, he got walloped (or so was the opinion of commentators and hyperventilating supporters of the president).</p> <p>Republicans were suddenly energised about a candidate for whom they had, until then, little affection, while Democrats, rather than rallying around the president, took turns trying to find new and creative ways to describe the full breadth of his defeat. Within days of the debate, the poll numbers began to shift dramatically in Romney's favour. By 9 October, only six days later, Romney had taken the lead in both Pollster.com's average of national polls and <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/\" title=\"\">Real Clear Politics</a> polling average.</p> <p>It seemed suddenly that a race, which once looked to be a foregone conclusion, was suddenly slipping out of the president's grasp. But not so fast. Just as soon as Romney's momentum began to rise, it stopped and the race simply reverted to the status that existed pre-debate; a narrow Obama lead in the national poll and a more significant lead in the all-important electoral college tally. It was helped along by Obama's stronger performances in the later debates, but the larger element of his continued advantage is a combination of both Obama the president and Obama the politician and the decisions that he has made wearing both hats.</p> <p>First, there are the presidential decisions. When historians look back on Obama's presidency \u2013 no matter what happens on 6 November \u2013 two legislative accomplishments will loom largest: the passage of comprehensive healthcare reform and the stimulus bill passed in February 2009 that saved the economy from further economic calamity.</p> <p>But while the stimulus might end up having an extraordinarily transformative and wide-reaching impact, it is rarely mentioned directly on the campaign trail by Obama. Instead, the president is more inclined to talk about a much smaller policy decision, but one whose political impact has been much larger \u2013 the bailout of the US car industry.</p> <p>In key swing states of the Midwest, where manufacturing is still the lifeblood of the economy, the<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/24/auto-bailout-obama-ohio_n_2011499.html\" title=\"\"> bailout</a> almost certainly saved the US car industry. Nowhere has the bailout paid larger political dividends than in Ohio, a state that is by far the most important in the entire election and where one in eight jobs is tied to the car industry. Ohio looms largest because even though it has the seventh highest number of votes in the US electoral college, if Obama wins there, along with Wisconsin and Nevada \u2013 two states where he is currently leading in public polls \u2013 there is virtually no chance he will lose the election.</p> <p>Obama has consistently led in Ohio. It is his campaign firewall. His advantage there comes not only from the auto bailout but also from the fact that he has devoted enormous time and energy to the state, both in numerous visits and the opening of 131 campaign offices, a total three times higher than that of Romney.</p> <p>This is the second key to Obama's likely success on election day \u2013 his campaign infrastructure. In 2008, the Obama campaign made the decision to utilise its vast resources in building the best ground game and best get-out-the- vote operation that American politics had ever seen. They succeeded and according to one political scientist may have, through their campaign efforts, moved three states into their column on election day.</p> <p>The Obama infrastructure appears better this year. Not only have the presidential campaigners developed sophisticated, data-driven techniques for identifying supporters, reaching out to them and ensuring they get to the polls, but they have opened hundreds of campaign offices around the country \u2013 almost exclusively in swing states \u2013 and hired hundreds of paid staff to man them.</p> <p>The Republican ground game has dramatically improved from the hapless McCain effort in 2008, but few political observers believe it can hold a candle to Obama's. Beyond the advantage in offices that Obama enjoys in Ohio, he has a nearly two to one edge in practically every other swing state. While the <em>number</em> of offices is not the whole story, it does provide a hint of how significant an investment Obama has made in his campaign infrastructure and in a close race that infrastructure has the potential to make all the difference.</p> <p>It's still hard to predict with certainty what will happen on election day. But it is, day by day, becoming ever more difficult to imagine a scenario in which Barack Obama is not re-elected president. And if he does win, it'll be in large measure because, to coin a phrase popularised by Republicans: \"He built that.\"</p>",
  "<p><strong>Is the editor of a very famous title more of a custodian than an innovator?</strong><br>That's probably fair. You don't want to screw things up. A magazine has to evolve every month but dramatic changes are always a mistake if you have a million-plus people (I hope) looking forward to what you do each month, and what your writers and photographers do, and so you want to surprise without being alarmingly different.</p> <p><strong>Where do you stand on the media industry debate about digital? Is advertising enough to make <em>Vanity Fair</em> pay online or is a paywall inevitable?</strong><br>This is all in the early stages \u2013 it's like television in 1947, so we don't know yet. We're very profitable in both our printed edition and on our website. We have an app that sells a fraction of what we do on the newsstand but I have a feeling that will all change and in 10 years it may eclipse the newsstand copies.</p> <p><strong>The writer Michael Lewis claimed that, taking flights, hotels, photography etc into account, one of his articles for <em>Vanity Fair</em> costs around $125,000. Is this true? </strong><br>I wish he hadn't said that! That must have been an extreme instance. If it is the case I don't know about it. We do pay journalists what they're worth, yes. I'll leave it at that.</p> <p><strong>Were you surprised at the response to Christopher Hitchens's death \u2013 what would he have made of it?</strong><br>I was surprised at how many young people were affected. He really had a following, and the fact that he never changed, he was exactly the same person, was quite wonderful. He would have been pleased and not necessarily surprised by what happened after he died. I've never met anyone like him and I don't think I will again. Not a day goes by that I don't instinctively almost pick up the phone to speak to him to write about something that has happened that day, and I have to remind myself he's gone.</p> <p><strong>Has America's standing improved in the world since you wrote </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/data/book/politics/9780316728676/what-weve-lost\" title=\"\"><strong><em>What We've Lost</em></strong></a><strong>?</strong><br>No. It was at an all-time high in the fall of 2001. For the first time in a long time, Americans had the world's sympathy. I don't think it's gone down or up. Other places, specifically Europe, have enough to worry about. Hating America is a luxury most Europeans can't afford right now.</p> <p><strong>You became extremely outspoken under the George W Bush administration. What infuriated you about him?</strong><br>A monthly magazine can stand for something, it doesn't have to be completely objective. When it came to getting us into a highly unnecessary war I was alone among my male friends \u2013 all of them thought Iraq was a great idea, and all my female friends thought it was a terrible idea. This is why women should be running the world. If you'd had an American administration made up of women we would not have gone into Iraq.</p> <p><strong>Would Romney make a better president than George W Bush?</strong><br>Anybody would make a better president than George W Bush. He'd be a perfectly OK president. He's not a true believer in the way [Romney's running mate] Paul Ryan is, with those crazy eyes. The true believers always terrify me, from the right or the left.</p> <p><strong>David Frum [former Bush speechwriter] has said that Republicans used to think Fox News worked for them and one day woke up and realised they worked for Fox. Are the shots really being called by Bill O' Reilly, </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/22/roger-ailes-fox-revolutionised-american-right?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\"><strong>Roger Ailes</strong></a><strong> etc?</strong><br>It's mutually profitable to both of them. But Fox News is the single most powerful aspect of the American right&#xa0;now.</p> <p><strong>Looking back at the 2008 election you realise that the demonisation of Obama - Obama the Muslim, Obama the socialist, Obama who 'pals around with terrorists'</strong> <strong>- began before the existence of the Tea Party, and the narrative hasn't changed much. How much of this is racially motivated?</strong><br>It's all racially motivated. There was a version of this when Kennedy ran as the first Catholic president. We've made a lot of advances, we may have a female president in 2016, but Americans when they go to the poll are not as enlightened as Europeans or South Americans or pretty much the rest of the world. We're ahead of China and Russia but that's about it.</p> <p><strong>Is the Tea Party institutionally racist?</strong><br>I don't know that it's racist but if the Tea Party had their way, poor people, and probably poor black people, would suffer more than anybody else. So it may not be that in intent but it is that in the result if they were a dominant political force.</p> <p><strong>Is it institutionally crazy?</strong><br>I'll let you say that.</p> <p><strong>In the UK, a political party that contained climate change-deniers, creationists and </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/19/republican-todd-akin-rape-pregnancy\" title=\"\"><strong>men who believe that women's bodies are inhabited by sperm-slaying ninjas </strong></a><strong>would have no chance of getting anywhere near power. How is it possible that the Republicans might win? </strong><br>Because America is such an enormous country. Britain is the size of a couple of north-east states. In many ways the individual states have about as much to do with each other as Britain and the Congo. They are completely different, united by a constitution and the dollar bill. Most people who live on the coast, east or west, think of central areas as the dark continent. They have no understanding of it, and people at the centre think the coasts are places where Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian live. There's not a lot of respect either way.</p> <p><strong>Will Hillary Clinton run in 2016?</strong><br>100%, yes. It's perfect. It gives her an excuse not to be with Bill \u2013 I think they're both fine with that. Her daughter has grown up; Hillary has great ambition, she is so superior to most politicians in so many ways, and she has an incredible four-year record now of being secretary of state.</p> <p><strong>You've said Obama has done pretty well \u2013 steadying the ship etc \u2013 so why do so many liberals, worldwide, feel let down?</strong><br>He inherited the worst pile of misfortune any president could inherit. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/05/unemployment-rate-below-8percent-obama-reelection\" title=\"\">Unemployment below 8%</a> is a miracle after what happened in 2008. The car industry is still alive, he got us out of one war and is getting us out of the next, and the symbolic killing of Osama bin Laden occurred under his watch. Liberals who are disappointed are the ones that were too fanboyish in 2007 and 2008. I never got that excited about him and therefore I'm not that disappointed in him.</p> <p><strong>Your editorials suggest the reason the Obama administration has not lived up to its promise is because of Republican obstinacy \u2026</strong><br>That's a part of it. In his first term he went for a legacy bill \u2013 the healthcare issue \u2013 as opposed to paying attention to the economy. Americans are different from Europeans, America is not a socialist country, and for some reason universal healthcare is not as important to Americans as it is to most westerners. That was a bill for the history books but not necessarily one for that particular moment.</p> <p><strong>What is the best and worst we can expect from an Obama second term? </strong><br>Unless he takes the House [of Representatives] it will be more of the same. The Republicans will be more intransigent and the only hope will be that the voters throw out a few incumbents.</p> <p><strong>And a Romney presidency? </strong><br>It wouldn't to be as bad as a Romney presidential campaign \u2013 and the true believer beside him [Ryan] will recede into the shadows as most vice presidents do. I don't think it's going to happen in any case. Obama is a closer, and will pull it off.</p> <p><strong>What would be best for <em>Vanity Fair?</em></strong><br>Speaking as a journalist, a Romney presidency would be wonderful, the way a Bush presidency was. As an American, I prefer another four years of Obama.</p>",
  "<p>\"If we win Virginia, we will win this election,\" President Barack Obama <a href=\"http://content.usatoday.com/communities/theoval/post/2012/08/obamas-key-to-victory-virginia/1\">told a cheering crowd in Leesburg</a>, in the north of the state, in August.</p> <p>Old Dominion, as Virginia is known, was one of the states Obama wrested from the Republicans in 2008, beating John McCain by six points as he swept to power. This time, his campaign knows it will be closer.</p> <p>Until recently the president held a slender lead over Mitt Romney here, but with the latter's recent resurgence, <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2012-virginia-president-romney-vs-obama\">the two appear to be neck-and-neck</a>. One of the keys to Obama's victory here in 2008, as in so many other states, was the lead he amassed among young voters, who turned out in huge numbers four years ago.</p> <p>The question now is whether he can count on them again.</p> <p>\"I voted for Obama last time because he seemed pretty inspirational, he's obviously a great talker and has a lot of charisma. But this year I have no clue who I'm going to vote for. I have no clue if I'm even going to vote.\"</p> <p>Amanda Ravan has been affected more than most by the economic downturn. Her father lost the job he had held for 25 years during the dying days of the Bush administration. He found work again in 2008, but hundreds of miles away, in South Carolina. He and her mother decided to move.</p> <p>\"I don't get to see them as often as I'd like,\" Ravan said. \"Maybe three or four times a year.\" The 25-year-old now lives with her grandmother in Mechanics Ville, 30 minutes drive east of Richmond. She works as a parking valet in Richmond at night and is attending Virginia Commonwealth University by day \u2013 hoping to become a kindergarten teacher.</p> <p>\"The jobs situation isn't great,\" she said. \"And the economy doesn't look like it's improved much. But it's hard with the opposite party stopping him.\"</p> <p>Ravan said she would watch the remaining presidential debates, which she said could potentially influence her decision, but she has become disillusioned since 2008. It's exactly the sort of story Obama and his campaign do not want to hear, but her apathy appears to be mirrored by some of the election polling.</p> <p>Just before the election four years ago, <a href=\"http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/2008/PPP_Release_Virginia_1102.pdf\">Gallup polling of likely voters</a> showed 15% of those planning to cast their vote were in the 18-29 age group. The organisation's <a href=\"http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/main/2012/10/obama-up-3-in-virginia.html#\">polling this time shows</a> that group making up just 12% of the electorate \u2013 a significant decrease.</p> <p>Young voters coming out in smaller numbers is more of a problem for Obama because he gets so much more support among that group. Americans aged between 18-29 voted almost 2 to 1 for Obama four years ago, as the Hope and Change message \u2013 plus the intense network of grassroots campaigning \u2013 won hearts and minds. While young people seem likely to vote in smaller numbers, some say they may also show less support for the president.</p> <p>\"Obama will still win the 18-29 vote,\" said Geoffrey Skelley, from the University of Virginia's center for politics. \"But the question is really does he get closer nationally to the two-thirds he got of them in 2008, or is he only at around 60% this time?\"</p> <p>Skelley said he \"would expect a drop off\" this time round. As well as a faltering economy, young people face much higher unemployment rates than the national average, meaning they feel the pinch more than other voters. Romney will not win the group, but he could tighten the gap.</p> <p>\"I'm voting for Romney,\" said Mallory Pellicane, a 22-year-old nurse from Richmond. \"For lots of different reasons. I haven't seen much from Obama over the last four years.\" Pellicane, who said she comes from a Republican family, voted for McCain in 2008, but said it was not just the family's honour that is guiding her vote. \"I really haven't seen any change at all,\" Pellicane said when asked about Obama's first term. \"He really hasn't done anything that I can look at and appreciate.\"</p> <p>As for the president's opponent: \"I just feel like I trust Romney. I feel like he really cares about people. And certain stories I've read about him I just really like,\" Pellicane said. \"I am going to be one of the first people there to vote. I am very anxious to vote for him.\"</p> <p>Some 70 miles west of Richmond is Charlottesville, home to one of America's top public universities. The University of Virginia was founded by Thomas Jefferson after his own eight-year spell as president at the turn of the 19th century. The third president of the United States left his stamp on much of the university's architecture, with gleaming white columns and domes flanking the famous Academical Lawn. The leaves were just beginning to fall in early October, as students began to re-immerse themselves into the academic year.</p> <p>\"Obama,\" said Kerri Murphy, a Spanish and environmental science student, when asked who she would vote for in November. \"Generally I care more about social issues than fiscal issues. It's difficult for me to vote for Romney and Ryan as a woman.\"</p> <p>While Obama has done some \"not so great things\" in the last four years, Murphy, 21, said there was no danger of her voting Republican. \"There could be two very different Americas depending on who gets elected.\"</p> <p>Murphy is illustrative of one of the serious problems Romney and the Republican party at large have with winning young voters: on basic social issues they simply do not match up. On the traditional Democrat stomping ground of a university campus the Guardian spoke to a number of voters who might not be considered die-hard Obama supporters, but felt turned off by Romney.</p> <p>\"I'm voting for Obama mostly because I believe in Democratic ideals. I'm pro-choice, pro-gay marriage,\" said 19-year-old Laura Biver, a biology student originally from Alexandria, Virginia. \"I don't particularly love Obama, but I like him better than Romney. And I like the ideas he stands for more.\"</p> <p>Travelling further south though, it became apparent that not every young Obama voter was casting their ballot simply as a way to keep Romney at bay.</p> <p>Alvin Mosley grew up in the tiny town of Appomattox, named after the Appomattocs Native American tribe who dwelt there in the 17th century. Moseley, now 23, enrolled in the Marines in 2007, but left the military last year and initially struggled to find work.</p> <p>\"In the debate Mitt Romney was talking about how the higher people, like the millionaires, pay less taxes and I don't think that's fair,\" Moseley said. \"I'm going to vote for Barack Obama. He's trying to keep the healthcare for people who can't afford healthcare. And also on top of that he's trying to make it faster for veterans to get their disability.\"</p> <p>Mosley toured Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria and Jordan while in the Marines, but became unemployed when he moved home. Mosley is a voter who can point to specific instances of how he has benefited from Obama's presidency, and is enthusiastic about voting. When out of work he was able to sign onto his mother's healthcare policy, as a result of the Affordable Healthcare Act, which allows people to stay on their parent's plans up to the age of 26.</p> <p>The 23-year-old now travels to work in Lynchburg, Virginia, a small city nestled in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. The city is built on a hill, with steep streets running through the downtown area, at points allowing commanding views of the dense woodland stretching away to the south.</p> <p>Down in the centre of Lynchburg, deserted when the Guardian stopped by on a Wednesday afternoon, a smattering of cafes and restaurants cater for downtown businesses. Shelli Monahan, 26, grew up in New Jersey, but moved to Lynchberg three years ago \u2013 \"because it's cheaper to live\". Monahan, who has two young children, works in a downtown cafe but plans to go to college.</p> <p>\"Without an education you can't make it [in New Jersey]. So I planned to move here, go to school \u2013 and now still not move back because it's still too expensive,\" she said.</p> <p>Monahan said she will vote for Obama in November. Like the young women voters in Charlottesville, she was mindful of where Romney and the Republicans stand on women's rights. \"[Republicans] think it's awful for a woman to expect birth control to be paid for by her health insurance,\" she said. \"I mean that's just ridiculous. Women's rights, being a woman, I take that very seriously. Definitely women's equality is a big thing.\"</p> <p>But Monahan is not just casting a vote against Romney. Like Mosley, she could also point to instances where Obama's presidency had \"definitely\" impacted her life, in her case through Obama increasing the funding for Pell grants. This positive impact is the main reason he will get her vote.</p> <p>\"He's for education. He wants to give everybody equal opportunity to get healthcare. My boyfriend is currently going to school for free on one of his grants, which is excellent.</p> <p>\"No matter if you're rich or poor everybody should have equal opportunity to go to school, to get healthcare.</p> <p>\"We should be treated equally.\"</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama and Mitt Romney embarked on a final 10-day dash towards the election on Saturday, campaigning in battleground states as hurricane Sandy threatened to disrupt their schedule.</p> <p>A new poll released as the candidates set out to woo swing voters in Florida and New Hampshire emphasised how important the final two weeks could be in the outcome of the 6 November national ballot. The Reuters/Ipsos survey of likely voter intention had Obama ahead by a whisker, leading Romney by 47% to 45%.</p> <p>And research indicated that 88% of registered voters said they would definitely vote for one candidate or the other, leaving just 12% who are yet to decide who will get their nod for the White House.</p> <p>The final days of campaigning will focus on that section of society in a handful of key states that are crucial to winning the presidential run-off.</p> <p>On Saturday, Romney hopped on a plane in Ohio to head for a rally in Florida. Republicans are pinning their hopes to carrying both states if they are to oust Obama from the White House.</p> <p>\"Let's win this,\" Romney emailed to supporters in a rallying call Saturday, adding: \"We're defying odds and holding strong.\"</p> <p>His vice-presidential pick Paul Ryan was in Ohio Saturday morning to press home the Republican message.</p> <p>At a factory in New Philadelphia, he told would-be voters: \"You know what you have in front of you, you know your responsibility.\"</p> <p>Meanwhile, the president opted to head to New Hampshire Saturday to start his 10-day countdown to election day. Before doing so, he used a new TV ad to urge Americans to consider Romney's plans to roll back Wall Street reforms, reduce education spending and turn Medicare into a voucher system.</p> <p>At the same time, the Republican candidate planned to cut taxes for the super-rich, the attack ad added. The commercial will air in Florida, Iowa, Ohio and Virginia.</p> <p>According to his official diary, Obama is due to head to Florida on Sunday before then going on the stump in Virginia, Colorado and Wisconsin early next week.</p> <p>But campaign stops may be subject to change if hurricane Sandy wreaks havoc along the US's east coast, as some forecasters are predicting.</p> <p>The so-called \"super storm\" has already killed scores of people in the Caribbean and is due to make landfall sometime Monday.</p> <p>Even ahead of its official arrival, connected adverse weather conditions have taken a toll on the campaign plan of both sides.</p> <p>Vice-president Joe Biden cancelled a rally at a coastal Virginia location planned for Saturday night to \"ensure that all local law enforcement and emergency management resources can stay focused on ensuring the safety of people who might be impacted by the storm\".</p> <p>Likewise, Romney was forced to abandon plans for an event in Virginia Beach on Sunday.</p> <p>Both presidential candidates have a delicate balance to maintain in terms of campaigning over the next few days.</p> <p>With the race so tight it is crucial for them to appeal to the narrowing number of floating voters in key states. But neither can risk being seen putting political self-interest above of public safety.</p>",
  "<p>Long lines quickly formed as early voting began in Florida on Saturday and electors confronted the longest ballot in their history, consisting of a range of choices from the next president to measures affecting healthcare reforms, the independence of the state supreme court and abortion.</p> <p>Florida is a tight and important swing state, particularly for Mitt Romney, the Republican candidate, who probably cannot win the presidency without taking its 29 electoral college votes.</p> <p>Opinion polls consistently put Romney about two percentage points ahead of Barack Obama, and both camps say the outcome is likely to be decided by which side can turn out supporters.</p> <p>The monster ballot includes 11 proposed amendments to the state constitution, some of which run for hundreds of words.</p> <p>Officials advised people to read the wording before arriving at polling places but lines still backed up as it took even those voters familiar with the ballots about 10 minutes to fill them out. Others said they spent up to half an hour to complete the forms.</p> <p>\"I came prepared,\" said Yvette Florian, waving the prepared ballot she copied her choices from, after voting at the Hart Memorial Central Library in Kissimmee.</p> <p>By mid-morning the line to vote extended down a flight of stairs and into the middle of the library.</p> <p>\"There's a lot of people want to vote. I think this is going to be a passionate election. There's people who don't want their welfare taken away and people who believe you should do it the old fashioned way and stand on your own two feet.\"</p> <p>Florian said she voted Republican.</p> <p>\"Romney won't run up more debt. Or if he does, his spending will create more jobs. It won't be handouts to the gimmies. I'm not a warmonger but if Romney spends on the military it's still creating jobs,\" said Florian who works for the state health department.</p> <p>Joseph Saenz couldn't disagree more.</p> <p>\"We need to keep social security going and Medicare. There's people who don't want to help people who need it,\" he said.</p> <p>Saenz, who works as a maintenance man for a liquor store, said he voted for Obama.</p> <p>\"He hasn't done everything he should have,\" he said. \"But [the Republican-controlled] Congress has stopped him doing what he wanted to do. It's like he's banging his head into a brick wall.\"</p> <p>Besides electing the president, members of the US Congress and the Florida legislature, many voters in the state are choosing local councils, sheriffs and other officials.</p> <p>They are also being asked to decide on proposed changes to Florida's state constitution. First on the list is a measure designed to block Obama's healthcare reforms by prohibiting laws that compel individuals to buy medical insurance \u2013 a key part of the president's legislation. </p> <p>Yesenia Valentin said she supported the change.</p> <p>\"I don't like to be told what to do,\" she said. \"The less federal government the better.\"</p> <p>Valentin said she voted a straight Republican ticket with the exception of the local sheriff.</p> <p>Even if the healthcare amendment passes, it is not clear that it is enforceable given that the US supreme court has already upheld what is known as the individual mandate.</p> <p>Legislators have also placed an amendment on the ballot that would exempt abortion-related matters from the state's privacy laws.</p> <p>The measure comes after Florida courts blocked the legislatures attempts to pass laws limiting access to abortion, citing the state's constitutional protections of privacy. The proposed change also bars state funds from paying for health insurance that includes abortion coverage.</p> <p>Other constitutional amendments on the ballot include a proposal by the Republican-controlled Florida legislature to curb the power of the state supreme court which conservatives have frequently criticised as too liberal in its judgments.</p> <p>More than 1 million of the estimated 9 million Floridians expected to vote have already cast an absentee ballot. Marginally more registered Republicans have voted than Democrats but the gap, at 5%, is considerably less than at the last presidential election \u2013 eroding a Republican advantage.</p> <p>Voting is easier than Republican legislators had hoped after a federal court struck down a stringent new identification law as discriminatory.</p> <p>The court also blocked restrictions on independent groups registering voters. But other new measures are in place including a cut in the number of early voting days and the closure of polling booths on the final Sunday before the election \u2013 the day on which large numbers of black people voted in Florida in 2008.</p> <p>Black churches have been leading a push, \"Souls to the Polls\", to get African Americans to vote early this weekend.</p> <p>The state also made it more difficult for those who move house to register to vote, which is thought to disproportionately affect students who tend to lean toward the Democrats.</p> <p>Floridians are particularly sensitive to problems with the vote given the state's notorious role in the 2000 election when votes that could have delivered victory to the Democratic party candidate, Al Gore, were discounted as part of the \"hanging chad\" fiasco.</p> <p>But already there are signs of trouble. Officials in Palm Beach county have spent the week painstakingly duplicating about 27,000 absentee ballots because a design flaw on the ballot papers meant the scanners could not read them. Every copied ballot is inspected by a Democratic party and a Republican poll watcher.</p>",
  "<p>The empty bookshelves piled up in the walkways of Nap Ford community school are a reminder of what a high-stakes business education in Florida has become; the surplus furniture is all that remains of a nearby school that closed this summer after being graded an \"F\" two years in a row.</p> <p>Jennifer Porter-Smith, principal of Nap Ford, needs little reminder. Her own school was downgraded to an F two years ago.</p> <p>\"It was devastating,\" she recalled. \"We pulled the team together and said the state is basically saying we are failing children \u2013 what are we going to do about it?\"</p> <p>For over a decade now, schools in Florida have been graded from A to F based on the performance and progress of their pupils in reading, writing, maths and science tests. A-grade or improving schools are rewarded with extra money, while schools receiving the lowest grade twice in a row face closure.</p> <p>It is a part of a package of reforms introduced under former governor Jeb Bush, which have become a model for other states and has been echoed in Barack Obama's education policy.</p> <p>The downgrading had a galvanising effect on Porter-Smith's school.</p> <p>\"We became very strategic and very focussed,\" she said. \"How do we equate what is happening in the classroom with student performance?</p> <p>\"We could have beautiful lesson plans, but are students understanding what is going on?\"</p> <p>Within a year, the school's grade had gone from an F to an A. The school's staff worked equally hard both years, the principal says, but focused more on preparation for testing in the year they were awarded the top grade.</p> <p>Since leaving office, Bush has become an advocate for education reform; setting up a non-proft foundation and touring the country to advise Republican politicians.</p> <p>In his speech to the Republican convention, the former governor emphasised the progress made by black and Hispanic children in Florida, who are now more likely to graduate from high school than their counterparts in other states.</p> <p>The racial dimension of education reform is significant; its proponents often call it the \"civil rights issue of our generation\". The appeal to conservative politicians who need minority voters is obvious.</p> <p>As well as grading schools, the Bush measures included requiring third graders to pass reading tests before they could move up to fourth grade, creating a merit pay system for teachers, and extending parental choice by encouraging the creation of independently run charter schools.</p> <p>At school level, the impact of the reforms has inevitably been messy. A school's grading has become crucial. Nap Ford is a small primary school \u2013 teaching from pre-kindergarten to fifth grade \u2013 in a tough urban setting where 98% of pupils are on free or reduced lunches, an indicator of poverty.</p> <p>\"Because we're such a small school, one child can be five or six percentage points,\" Porter-Smith said. There are 153 children in the school, but only the upper two grades take the tests.</p> <p>There is a high rate of teacher turnover. In one class a new teacher left after a single day. That particular class had six teachers in three months.</p> <p>The principal said: \"A lot of the urban community are disproportionately taught by new teachers, who are going to have a challenge managing the classroom. Children get multiple years of that.\"</p> <p>Being downgraded prompted the school to question what it was doing. But it also made life harder as philanthropic funding dried up.</p> <p>The principal said: \"When you have a year where a school gets an F, fundraising becomes harder, everybody wants to back someone who's doing well.\"</p> <p>That in turn made it impossible to pay for a longer school day, which was one of the measures the school had introduced to support its pupils.</p> <p>A study which looked at the impact of Florida's school grading found that it had a detrimental effect on teacher turnover. The research by economists Li Feng, David Figlio and Tim Sass said that: \"Schools that were 'shocked' downwards \u2013 and thus faced the most pressure to improve \u2013 lost more and higher quality teachers.\"</p> <p>The Florida model is now being imitated by states across the country, inspiring new legislation in Arizona, New Mexico, Utah and Indiana.</p> <p>Obama has praised Bush as a \"champion of education reform\", and the changes in Florida are mirrored in many elements of the president's signature education initiative Race to the Top.</p> <p>The Obama initiative is a competition for federal funds, awarded to states that embrace changes including charter schools and performance pay for teachers.</p> <p>The reforms in Florida have put greater pressure on the school system in two ways; by increasing accountability for schools and teachers, and by giving parents more options than just their local public school.</p> <p>The state has a tax credit scheme that encourages companies to sponsor scholarships at private schools for families of modest means. It has also backed the creation of charter schools. There are now over 500 charters in the state, educating nearly 180,000 students in the last school year.</p> <p>The management of charters can be contracted out, allowing private education firms to make profits from running schools. One such firm, Academica, runs nearly 100 schools in the state.</p> <p>Michael Kooi, director of school choice for Florida, suggests that charters have made a difference by spurring change in the public system.</p> <p>\"Before [charter schools] they had a captive audience and now there's competition, let's face it,\" Kooi said.</p> <p>\"In order to keep kids they've improved for one thing but also provided more options to kids as well.</p> <p>\"That might [mean] just taking more of a math focus at high school, or maybe that you take fine arts classes.\"</p> <p>During the election campaign, Obama has downplayed school choice in favour of speaking about investment in education.</p> <p>Jeb Bush, by contrast, used <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\" nib0atmm-s8\"\">his convention speech</a> to compare choosing between schools with the freedom to shop around for flavored milk in a supermarket. \"They even make milk for people who cannot drink milk,\" he said. \"Shouldn't parents have that kind of choice in schools that best meets the needs of their students?\"</p> <p>The gap between the two parties is narrower than it seems here. In the past, Obama's administration <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/11/us/politics/11web-educ.html?_r=\" 0\"\">has lauded charter schools</a> as \"laboratories of innovation\".</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/09/10/us-usa-chicago-schools-analysis-idUSBRE8890VS20120910\">confrontation in Chicago</a> has emphasised the consensus between the parties on charters. Though never officially a part of the dispute between Rahm Emanuel and the teachers' union, the mayor is pushing to expand the number of charters in the city.</p> <p>Common to both parties is an anxiety that the US is being outpaced by Asia while politicians and teachers dispute the details of change. Bush noted that China and India are producing \"eight times more engineering students each year\" than the US.</p> <p>Obama, more emolliently as far as his public sector supporters are concerned, declared: \"I don't believe that firing teachers \u2026 will grow the economy or help us compete with the scientists and engineers coming out of Asia.\"</p> <p>Mark Pudlow, spokesman for the Florida Education Association, a teachers' union, said the state's school system has been a Petri dish for reform.</p> <p>\"Since Jeb Bush was elected governor we've been a laboratory for all kinds of corporate influence on public schools, without any input from teachers or credible education researchers,\" Pudlow said.</p> <p>Further change lies ahead. Last year, the current governor of Florida, Rick Scott, brought in new legislation which will overhaul the way teachers are paid. The Student Success Act means at least half of a classroom teacher's evaluation will be based on students' gains in standardised tests. Pay rises will be based on these evaluations, replacing a system in which teachers' evaluation is based entirely on a principal's assessment. But the statewide tests only cover reading, writing, maths and science, meaning that some teachers' evaluation will be based on subjects they have not taught.</p> <p>Pudlow said: \"Let's say you're a history teacher, there's no [standardised test] for history, but the law says you have to be evaluated on testing. If you're a history teacher you have to be evaluated by standardised tests given in subjects you don't teach.\"</p> <p>Even if school districts can evolve new tests to cover these subjects, the union argues that it will be difficult to measure teacher performance in areas such as physical education and music.</p> <p>At the heart of the argument over merit pay is a clash between the natural desire of governments to gather data and map performance, and the view of many teachers that school is a broad experience that resists being captured in test results.</p> <p>Nancy Hunter, who teaches at a high school in Leesburg, Florida, says that her subject is essentially unquantifiable. She teaches \"Freshman Foundations\" \u2013 a class in life skills that teaches children how to be \"good citizens\", Hunter said.</p> <p>\"I'm going to be evaluated on tests they're taking one day in the year and they may be kids I've never set eyes on.</p> <p>\"It's flawed in taking one day of one test rather than what I do day in and day out.\"</p> <p>Whoever wins the presidential election, the outcome is likely to disappoint teachers like Hunter. The mood in the US has shifted away from a belief in trusting professionals to one that emphasises scrutiny of schools through testing and parental choice. There will be more schools that fail to make the grade and end up as a pile of furniture in a corridor.</p>",

Williams, Dr E. Young.</p> <h2>Comments</h2> <p>195 entries, no mistakes. As a new special, \u2018Collisions\u2019 seems to have been well received. Of course, it contains elements of \u2018Overlaps\u2019 and \u2018Right and Left\u2019, but with an original slant. I don\u2019t suppose I\u2019m the only setter to have noticed the Titanic/iceberg overlap but once it occurred to me it gave me the germ of an idea for this puzzle, especially in the centenary year of that famous collision. I wasn\u2019t sure at the outset how tricky it would be to construct the grid but in the event it came out reasonably smoothly. I had to have a large number of 12-letter across entries in order to avoid too many unches in the downs, though the effect of this was to produce a lot of down words with no unches at all \u2013 good for you but tough for me. Favourite clues of the month were, of 16 nominated at least once, \u2018More than one such old taxman could be terribly strict with the poor\u2019 (TITHE-PROCTOR) from the downs, and \u2018Crusader hero, captive of Sultan, causing state of readiness for e.g. war, later released\u2019 (TANCREDALERT) from the acrosses.</p> <p>As with other types of double clue, the challenge for you was to produce a complete clue in which the \u2018join\u2019 was well disguised and the whole read seamlessly, with more than a modicum of sense overall. This meant eschewing linking words between the two parts and also between the definition and subsidiary elements within each component of the collision. I regarded the latter as important, and avoided such links in my own clues, because the full form and the truncated form are different, so the one cannot be seen as standing for or leading directly to the other. Another point worthy of mention (because it came up quite often) was the use of \u2018growler\u2019 or \u2018calf\u2019 as definitions for \u2018iceberg\u2019. They are certainly types of (small) iceberg, but whereas all growlers and calves in this sense are icebergs not all icebergs are growlers or calves. So, as in Mr Ward\u2019s clue above, some qualifier such as \u2018maybe\u2019, \u2018perhaps\u2019 or \u2018possibly\u2019 is required. I allowed Dr Fletcher\u2019s clue into the VHCs (just) despite its failing in this, on the grounds that it is very clever in other respects.</p> <p>Other comments on competition entries in general: some of the definitions chosen for TITANIC were on the distinctly weak side, e.g. \u2018big\u2019, \u2018fat\u2019, large\u2019; likewise treating TITANIC as \u2018of or relating to Titans\u2019 struck me as a bit uninspired; and for some reason there were several instances of \u2018a\u2019 being used as a definition of \u2018an\u2019, which I can\u2019t accept. Equivalent yes, definition no. And several competitors made the mistake of presenting the four elements of their clue in more-or-less random order, instead of with both elements of one part preceding both those of the other part.</p> <p>In conclusion may I say that I was very touched by and am extremely grateful for the many messages of sympathy I have received from solvers about the recent death of my father. I hope you will understand if I don\u2019t respond to them all individually.</p>",
  "<p>At the age of 86 retired plumber Paul Holz has just been arrested for the first time in his long life.</p> <p>Clutching an American flag, the elderly resident of Freeport, Illinois, was handcuffed by police outside a Sensata car parts plant which is shipping jobs to China and has become a national symbol for the outsourcing of American manufacturing jobs abroad.</p> <p>\"I am totally against outsourcing work from America. Jobs need to stay here, so I decided to go down and join the protests,\" he explained.</p> <p>That decision ended in a trip to the local police station and a mugshot for the lifelong union supporter.</p> <p>But Holz is far from alone. Workers, ex-workers and local residents have set up an encampment outside the gate. They have held protests, tried to deliver petitions and sought to prevent vehicles shipping out plant parts destined for China from leaving the site.</p> <p>Because Sensata is majority owned by Bain Capital \u2013 the controversial former company run by Republican challenger Mitt Romney \u2013 the camp has been dubbed Bainport.</p> <p>So far there have been more than 20 arrests, including this week veteran civil rights activist Reverend Jesse Jackson.</p> <p>But Holz is no doubt the oldest to end up behind bars for seeking to keep the Sensata jobs in the town.</p> <p>\"I guess everyone is allowed one time to get arrested. But they did put on the cuffs a little tight,\" he said, though he added that police gave him back his American flag when he left the station.</p> <p>\"I got it back and when I went outside there was a little crowd and they cheered,\" he said.</p> <p>What is happening at Freeport has also become a part of the 2012 election.</p> <p>Romney still owns stock in Sensata and thus has benefited financially from cost-cutting in Freeport even as the Republican candidate has made a point of lambasting China and outsourcing jobs a key part of his election pitch.</p> <p>As a result fired workers and those soon to lose their jobs have staked out Romney rallies and even travelled to the Republican convention in Tampa, Florida.</p> <p>Liberal cable TV channel MSNBC has regularly broadcast shows from Bainport and Reverend Al Sharpton has hosted a rally there.</p> <p>The actions and publicity have rattled Sensata too.</p> <p>Local officials and union organisers say that the company has this week threatened to close the plant early if the protests and civil disobedience continue.</p> <p>\"It was management's attempt to threaten and intimidate and scare the workers,\" said local union organiser Caleb Jennings.</p> <p>\"But the greater threat to them is their jobs going to China.\"</p> <p>The move has prompted current workers to launch two official complaints with the National Labor Relations Board about the threat of early closure and also for increasing plant security and barring off-duty workers from entering the site.</p> <p>An investigator from the NLRB is expected to arrive in Freeport on Monday.</p> <p>Sensata has denied the allegations. \"We believe the charges are without merit,\" the firm said in a memo posted on its website.</p> <p>Joanne Penniston, 35, is a still current Sensata worker who has also been arrested during the protests.</p> <p>So too has her daughter. Penniston said she was not afraid of the threat to shut down the plant early, potentially depriving the last remaining workers of a few weeks pay.</p> <p>\"It made me want to protest more after we got threatened. It is already shutting down, so they can take their scare tactics elsewhere.</p> <p>We have a right to do what we are doing,\" she said. Penniston's current termination date for her job is 16 December. She has no idea what she will do after that date passes.</p> <p>\"There are no jobs here in Freeport. It's like a ghost town. Probably I will have to move,\" she said.</p>",
  "<p>The Obama administration is reportedly mulling a new tax cut that would increase workers' take-home salaries and replace the soon-to-be expiring payroll tax reduction.</p> <p>On Saturday, the Washington Post quoted White House sources as suggesting the fiscal measure could boost the economy and add hundreds of dollars to employees' annual pay.</p> <p>Responding to the report, the White House said no new tax policy suggestion had been formulated. \"There's no specific new proposal such as this one at this time,\" an official said.</p> <p>\"The very first thing Congress should do is the House needs to follow the Senate's lead and pass the bill the president proposed to ensure taxes don't go up on 98% of Americans at the beginning of next year,\" the staffer added.</p> <p>But according to the Washington Post article, the administration believed the economy could use further stimulus despite signs of improvement and is eyeing the new tax relief as a potential solution.</p> <p>Obama is locked in a tight re-election battle with Republican challenger Mitt Romney in which the struggling economy is the main issue. Obama has proposed letting Bush-era tax cuts expire for the wealthy, but Romney has said tax increases would damage the economy.</p> <p>The payroll tax first implemented in 2011 at Obama's request was designed to help provide people an economic cushion, but critics have questioned relying on a measure that cuts funds from the social security retirement system.</p> <p>The Post said the Obama administration wanted to match the benefits of the payroll tax reduction without tapping into social security revenues.</p> <p>Regardless of the election outcome, the country faces a \"fiscal cliff\" of automatic across-the-board spending cuts and tax increases for the end of the year unless the White House and Congress can strike a deficit reduction deal.</p> <p>Obama told the Des Monies Register on Tuesday that he was confident that if re-elected, he would secure within six months a deficit-reduction deal with Republicans equivalent to the \"grand bargain\" he failed to achieve last year.</p> <p>The goal of such a deal would be to achieve $4tn in deficit reduction over 10 years.</p>",

  "<p>Racial prejudice in America is more widespread now than when President Barack Obama became the country's first black president in a historic 2008 vote, a new survey has shown.</p> <p>In a poll of racial attitudes by the Associated Press news agency, researchers found that more Americans have attitudes that are both implicit and explicitly racist than when the same survey was conducted four years ago.</p> <p>The news comes as Obama is deadlocked in a tight race for re-election against Republican challenger Mitt Romney and surveys have shown strong support for Obama among minorities while white voters favour Romney.</p> <p>In all, 51% of Americans now express explicit anti-black attitudes, compared with 48% four years ago, the study showed.</p> <p>When measured by an implicit racial attitudes test, the number of Americans with anti-black sentiments jumped to 56%, up from 49% during the last presidential election.</p> <p>\"As much as we'd hope the impact of race would decline over time \u2026 it appears the impact of anti-black sentiment on voting is about the same as it was four years ago,\" said Jon Krosnick, a Stanford University professor who worked with AP to develop the survey.</p> <p>A majority of Americans expressed anti-Hispanic sentiments, too.</p> <p>In an AP survey done in 2011, 52% of non-Hispanic whites expressed anti-Hispanic attitudes. That figure had risen to 57% in the implicit test in 2012.</p> <p>There was no comparative data for before that. Though race has not been played an especially high profile in the election campaign so far America, like many societies, still struggles with racism.</p> <p>During his four years in office Obama has repeatedly had to contend with untrue rumours that he is a Muslim or was not born in America \u2013 a phenomenon of fear of \"the other\" that some link to his being a black American.</p> <p>The AP poll showed that racial prejudice against Obama could cost him five points in the current election campaign.</p> <p>However, conversely pro-black sentiment could see him scoop an extra three points, meaning a net loss due to racial attitudes of 2%.</p> <p>The survey also found that some 79% of Republicans expressed explicit racial prejudice compared to 32% of Democrats.</p> <p>The implicit test too showed that 64% of Republicans had racial prejudice compared to 55% of Democrats, while independents came in at 49%.</p> <p>The explicit racism test asked respondents whether they agreed or disagreed with a series of statements about black and Hispanic people.</p> <p>In addition, the surveys asked how well respondents thought certain words, such as \"friendly\", 'hardworking\", ''violent\" and \"lazy\" described blacks, whites and Hispanics.</p> <p>The same respondents were also administered a survey designed to measure implicit racism, in which a photo of a black, Hispanic or white male flashed on the screen before a neutral image of a Chinese character.</p> <p>The respondents were then asked to rate their feelings toward the Chinese character. Previous research has shown that people transfer their feelings about the photo onto the character, allowing researchers to measure racist feelings even if a respondent does not acknowledge them.</p> <p>The AP poll comes amid a slew of books and research studies analysing the current situation of black America that have found it has suffered greatly in the wake of the Great Recession.</p> <p>The Pew Charitable Trust showed that some 68% of middle class black Americans are predicted to see their economic status decline in the next generation.</p> <p>The National Urban League civil rights group also showed from 2009 to 2012 median annual household income for blacks dropped by 11.1%, compared to a drop of just 5.2% for whites and 4.1% for Hispanics.</p> <p>The current black unemployment rate of 14% is roughly twice that of the white jobless rate.</p> <p>Elsewhere ,a new book, called Documenting Desegregation, has examined racial equality in the workplace after the 1960s.</p> <p>It found that progress largely halted in 1980 and in fact has actually got worse in some industries since then.</p> <p>Indeed racial segregation between white and black men is increasing in one-in-six industries.</p> <p>Co-author Donald Tomaskovic-Devey, a professor at the University of Massachusetts, said societal attitudes had changed in America, but not practical applications.</p> <p>\"Most white Americans do think that we should live in an equal opportunity society. But we do not actually apply that very practically. On a behavioural level, we are not post-racial,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>There are 11 days left in the presidential election, and the picture is static. Mitt Romney and President Obama remain knotted in the national vote. Obama, however, maintains an edge in the all-important electoral college. The lead is small, but seemingly solid.</p> <p>I have written about <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/16/romney-routes-victory-battleground-states\">three paths for Romney</a> to win this election. These paths all assumed that Romney wins Colorado, Florida, and Virginia.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/co/colorado_romney_vs_obama-2023.html\">Colorado</a> is a toss-up at this point. The Real Clear average has the race dead even. So, Romney can't really count on that state. <br> <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/fl/florida_romney_vs_obama-1883.html\">Florida</a> is a state where I feel fairly confident that Romney will win. He holds a near 2-point lead in the Real Clear Politics average. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/va/virginia_romney_vs_obama-1774.html\">Virginia</a> is a tougher state. The Real Clear average has Romney ahead by about a point, and the conventional wisdom is that Romney is doing well.</p> <p>That leaves us with an electoral vote score of 248 for Romney and 238 for Obama.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398434640\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/26/1351289209512/map1_460.jpg\" alt=\"electoral map 10/26\" width=\"460\" height=\"346\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Even if Romney were to carry Colorado, I'm fairly convinced that he's likely done in <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/nv/nevada_romney_vs_obama-1908.html\">Nevada</a>. There has only been one Silver State poll this entire year with him in the lead. Nevada <a href=\"http://www.ralstonflash.com/blog/democrats-extend-lead-clark-36000-voters#.UIr9AL9nFE4\">early voting numbers</a> look fantastic for Obama. He leads by 2.5 in the Real Clear average, and in every poll in the average.</p> <p>The fact that Romney can't win in even a single poll in Nevada is a key point. There have been five presidential state contests where all the averages (Pollster.com, Real Clear, etc) were wrong since 2000. That translates to a 97% success rate; the equivalent conversion rate in 2004 and 2008 was 98%. You can say, though, that averages do occasionally get the result wrong.</p> <p>The chance of every single poll getting the result incorrect in a general election is far less likely. In all presidential state contests except one since 2000, there was at least one poll where the eventual winning candidate led even as the average had him behind. That was <a href=\"http://www.duke.edu/~rml5/RA/Aldrich/wh2000gen_state3.htm\">New Mexico in 2000</a> where two of the polls showed a tie and the other one had a small Bush lead. Bush lost that contest by less than 400 votes.</p> <p>Thus, in only one in 150 of the state contests in the last three presidential elections was there an instance of a candidate winning a state where he didn't hold the edge in at least a single poll in the closing weeks of the campaign.</p> <p>This is a major problem that's plaguing Romney in multiple spots.</p> <p>There are a few more examples of a candidate winning out of nowhere in Senate and gubernatorial contests, but these include either third-party candidates (such as the Illinois gubernatorial election in 2010) or large Spanish-speaking populations (such as the Nevada senatorial in 2010). Only the latter factor applies in one of the states Romney needs (Nevada), and effective exclusion of Spanish-speaking voters in polls is likely to benefit Obama, not Romney.</p> <p>If Romney doesn't win in Nevada, then, he must win either <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/oh/ohio_romney_vs_obama-1860.html\">Ohio</a>, or <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/wi/wisconsin_romney_vs_obama-1871.html\">Wisconsin</a> and New Hampshire, or Iowa. </p> <p>Obama's advantage in Ohio is only 2.3 points in the Real Clear average. Again, Romney doesn't lead in a single poll in the average. The best he can do is a tie in 11 polls conducted over the last week. Candidates in this position almost never win. </p> <p>Wisconsin is the same exact story. Romney hasn't been ahead in a single poll since August, even though the current average has him down only 2.3 points.</p> <p>Taking these states together and too-close-to-call races in Colorado, <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/ia/iowa_romney_vs_obama-1922.html\">Iowa</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/nh/new_hampshire_romney_vs_obama-2030.html\">New Hampshire</a>, my current map, if the election were held today, looks like this:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398434641\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/26/1351289317547/map2_460.jpg\" alt=\"electoral map 2, 10/26\" width=\"460\" height=\"345\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>On that showing, Obama wins with at least 271 electoral votes. </p> <p>That's not to say the map won't look different in a few days. I believe Romney can win in Ohio and/or Wisconsin on election day. He doesn't even need to be ahead in the averages at the end of the campaign. History suggests, however, that he's got to be leading in at least one of the polls in these two contests. That's why I'm waiting for a poll, any poll, not sponsored by a political action group that has Romney with an edge in either the Buckeye or the Badger State. </p> <p>Now, there's always the chance that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/13/baseball-politics-st-louis-cardinals\">this year is different</a> than every other year; I don't doubt that possibility. That's why you won't hear me say this is a shoo-in for Obama even if his state leads stay steady right until election eve.</p> <p>But it's very difficult to look at the success rate of polling over the last few years and conclude that it's anything but a long shot for Romney \u2013 if the polls hold as they are.</p>",

  "<p>Angela Shaw does not believe it, but she is in the frontline of a war. The 42-year-old Florida lawyer is in a crucial swing state and thus represents what is emerging as a decisive factor in America's 2012 election \u2013 the female voters set to determine the race for the White House.</p> <p>As the bitter contest enters its final week, President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney are neck-and-neck and their campaigners are now doing everything they can to persuade voters that their party would best serve women's interests.</p> <p>Television ads appeal directly to them; at campaign stops both Obama and Romney speak about them; and surrogates from Bill Clinton to Cindy McCain are wheeled out to tout for their support. Yet Obama has seen a strong lead among women almost disappear, making it feasible that they might vote on 6 November to put a Republican back in the Oval Office.</p> <p>That is certainly what Shaw wants to see. \"I think Obama has been an abysmal failure. He's done nothing for people like me,\" she said at a campaign stop in the central Florida town of Winter Park, where Romney's spouse, Ann, was holding a rally. Shaw said she had been largely out of work for the last four years, as had her husband, an estate agent. That, she said, was more than enough to make her want Obama to lose. \"If Romney wins, I think there will be an economic uptick. It would be not be overnight, but the economy will be finally moving forward,\" she said.</p> <p>That sort of sentiment is a nightmare to the Obama team. For months the Democrats have enjoyed a huge lead among women. It helped them weather much of Romney's rise after Obama's disastrous performance in the first presidential debate.</p> <p>Now there are signs that this usually solid bulwark of support is crumbling. A poll last week from AP-GfK had Obama and Romney level among women at 47 points each. Only a month ago the same survey had Obama ahead by 16 points. The average of the overall national polls has Romney edging into a two-point lead. \"Obama must do very well with women voters or not get a second term,\" said Professor Robert Watson, an expert in American studies at Lynn University in Florida.</p> <p>Some experts believe the Democrats have made a strategic mistake. Over the summer the Obama campaign leaped on a series of gaffes by Republican politicians and conservative commentators, such as radio host Rush Limbaugh, on abortion, rape and reproductive rights.</p> <p>Democrats touted a \"Republican war on women\" as one of the main planks of their campaign and seemed destined to tighten their hold on the female vote. But now it seems that a simple fact has been overlooked: in a struggling economy, women voters will put concern over jobs first. One study showed that, of the 2.6m jobs created since the recession ended, 80% have gone to men. \"The Democrats played up social issues and thought they were going to coast to victory,\" said Katherine Jellison, a history professor at Ohio University. \"Now Democrats have to spin the social issues back to the economy.\"</p> <p>Yet that territory is one the Republicans have been owning for months. Romney and his running mate, the firebrand Wisconsin congressman Paul Ryan, have hammered home their argument that Obama has failed to stimulate the economy or significantly reduce the suffering of those hit by joblessness. The AP poll, for example, showed 51% thought Romney would do a better job of managing the economy, compared with 44% for Obama.</p> <p>That was the message Ann Romney was pumping out in Winter Park. Though the town, near Orlando, is one of the most upmarket in the state, with its leafy streets lined with expensive bistros, the image Romney painted was of an America on the brink of collapse.</p> <p>\"Like you, we have friends and neighbours that are suffering in this economy,\" she told the predominantly female crowd. \"We're going to get it right this time, and we're going to make sure in November that we make Mitt Romney the next president of the United States.\"</p> <p>Of course, the Obama campaign is far from dead. His team still expects to win, both with women voters and overall. Speaking to journalists last week, Obama's top political adviser, David Axelrod, was full of confident bluster, even offering a $10,000 bet to reporters that Romney could not explain how he plans to balance the ballooning deficit. \"We feel strongly that we have the winning hand,\" he said. \"Governor Romney will take us back to the foreign policy of the 1980s, the social policy of the 1950s and the economic policy of the 1920s.\"</p> <p>That sort of language works with some women, warning of a reversal of social rights, such as abortion, that have been hard won. \"Those issues are very important to me,\" said Mary Faso, 61, an academic at Broward College in Davie, Florida, where Michelle Obama was speaking. \"It matters a lot to me and to a lot of the young people here. Romney on these matters is scary.\"</p> <p>Faso was in a crowd of 2,000 who had packed into a sports hall to listen to the first lady. The audience full of women listened intently as she warned of the dire consequences of a Romney win and listed her husband's achievements. \"When it comes to understanding the lives of women, when it comes to standing up for our rights and opportunities, we know my husband will always have our backs.\"</p> <p>There has been a clear distinction between the camps. During the Democrats' convention in North Carolina \u2013 a swing state that many experts think is likely to fall to Romney \u2013 the party touted its passing of the Lilly Ledbetter law, which helps get equal pay for women. Obama and his supporters also sell his healthcare reforms as a way of helping women.</p> <p>But neither that, nor the Republicans' repeated gaffes over rape and abortion, have halted the Romney rise in the last three weeks. In a swath of swing states, from Colorado, to New Hampshire, the polls have narrowed dramatically. Most of them are evenly split with barely a glimmer of daylight between the candidates. \"It is very close. That is why the fight over the female vote has now become so important,\" said Professor Bruce Gronbeck, a political scientist at the University of Iowa.</p> <p>Most people expect ground zero of the election to be Ohio. No Republican candidate has won the White House without achieving victory in that midwestern state that combines a stretch of \"rust belt\" along its northern coast, rural farmland around the capital Columbus and a heavily Republican southern border with Kentucky. If Obama can stop Romney in Ohio, so the Democrat argument goes, then the Romney advance will be blocked and Obama will win re-election. The latest polls there vary from calling the race a tie to having Obama up by five points.</p> <p>For the moment, that is grounds for Axelrod to keep expressing his confidence. \"This race has settled into exactly where we thought we would be. It is the race we prepared for,\" he said. \"We will know who is bluffing and who isn't [on election day] and I'm looking forward to it.\"</p> <p>Such bravado is increasingly rare on both sides as attitudes across America harden and the still undecided voters become harder to find. One such is Daniel Snow, a 28-year-old estate agent who moved from Romney's home state of Massachusetts to Florida a year ago. He voted for Obama in 2008 but now is unsure whom he will back. He was not a fan of Romney's period in charge of Massachusetts but nor does he feel Obama has fulfilled his potential.</p> <p>\"I voted for Obama four years ago. I don't regret my decision, but I did not see the change that I thought I would,\" he said, explaining he had come to see Michelle Obama speak in Davie to \"get some more information\" that would help him make a choice. Snow was a rare male figure at the event; as the election hits the closing stages, it is women who are centre stage.</p> <p>Commentators and statisticians have tried to come up with a term for them this year. They have been dubbed \"waitress moms\" or \"Walmart moms\" who are not college-educated and earn relatively low wages. Each side has devoted much attention to getting its women supporters to the polls. \"All this hard work and progress: it's all on the line, it's all at stake this November,\" said Michelle Obama in Davie. Meanwhile, in Winter Park, Ann Romney was busy thanking the hundreds of women who turned out to express their support. Standing under a Women for Mitt banner, she boasted of her 18 grandchildren and told the overwhelmingly female crowd: \"We need you to get out there.\"</p> <p>Yet, for all the attention now focused on them, some female voters say the equation is actually simple. They do not like being singled out as a demographic, when they represent the majority of the electorate. Nor do they appreciate such things as abortion being pitched as \"women's issues\" that will solely decide their allegiance.</p> <p>\"Obama says that Romney has a war on women. I don't agree with that,\" said Shaw. \"By saying that, he says that all women are concerned about is birth control and abortion. It demeans us. It says we don't have a brain,\" she said. Shaw says she has other, more pressing concerns when it comes to an election that is now just over a week away.</p> <p>They have nothing to do with her sex, instead reflecting the deep and abiding economic woes that still mark the American electorate. \"We haven't lost our home, but so many people I have worked with have lost everything,\" she said.</p>"
