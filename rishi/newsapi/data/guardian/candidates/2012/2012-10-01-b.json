  "<p>Despite all the energy put into it, no one ever wins \"the expectations game\". It's like having a contest for \"best behind-the-scenes preparation\" among magicians \u2013 if the audience gets to see what's behind the curtain, you've already lost them. Thus, the usual protocol for campaign dialog in the lead-up to events such as debates is a perverse, easily ignored race to the bottom: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"My candidate is going to suck.\"</p> <p>\"No, MY candidate is going to suck.\"</p> <p>\"Your candidate is the best debater in the history of America.\"</p> <p>\"Your candidate is the best debater in the history of the WORLD.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>There's been a certain amount of that in the past week. <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57523220/obama-camp-plays-down-debate-expectations/\">Obama told</a> an audience in Las Vegas, \"Governor Romney \u2013 he's a good debater. I'm just OK.\" On Romney's part, the language has been a little more florid, with senior advisor Beth Myers releasing a <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/09/romney-campaign-sets-debate-expectations-low-against-obama/\">memo stating</a>, \"President Obama is a universally-acclaimed public speaker\" with \"ample rhetorical gifts\".</p> <p>This kind of \"after-you-Alphonse\" maneuvering is so expected as to be disregarded. But let's give the Romney campaign this: there is at least one part of the campaign that has recently become totally transparent. Most campaigns simply avoid telegraphing the expectation that their candidate will perform better-than-adequately; on Sunday, the Romney campaign jumped that particular shark by pugnacious New Jersey Governor Chris Christie <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/01/politics/crowley-christie/index.html\">telling NBC</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Wednesday night's the restart of this campaign \u2026 And I think you're going to see those numbers start to move right back in the other direction.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Announcing, as Christie did, \"the entire narrative of this race is going to change\" is unusual enough. The Romney campaign, having already proven able to discover impressive new ways for a nomination to blunder (my jaw still involuntarily drops a little when I hear the phrase \"<a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/09/secret-video-romney-private-fundraiser\">47%</a>\"), they have now added yet another type of podiatric wound to their catalogue. According to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/29/us/politics/cramming-and-pruning-for-first-presidential-debate.html?_r=0\">a report in the New York Times</a> on Saturday, Romney's staff \"has equipped him with a series of zingers that he has memorized and has been practicing on aides since August.\"</p> <p>Already an awkward presence, Romney seems particularly susceptible to the tense stillness and deathless pathos that accompanies a dud punchline. Picturing the forced jocularity around the campaign headquarters has its pleasures, specifically the idea of Mitt trotting out well-worn jokes with the panache of a Catskills stand-up: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"Take my economic policy \u2026 please!\"</p> <p>\"How lazy is half America? So lazy \u2026\"</p> <p>\"Any car-elevator owners in the audience tonight?\"</p> </blockquote> <p>But there's an awful flipside: my God, what if he actually tries one of them?</p> <p>Whether you wince or guffaw at the image of Romney attempting and failing to \"zing\" the president, probably says more about your tolerance for the humiliation of others than your political sensibilities. You'd think covering politics would have inured me to it by now, but in real life, I can't even watch \"American Idol\". I will view the debate on Wednesday through the spaces between my fingers, with a desk nearby to bang my head against.</p> <p>OK, there's a chance it'll all work \u2013 that Christie will be proven right, that Romney will masterfully compete in a political game of \"the dozens\" and walk away not just with bragging rights, but with the election in the bag.</p> <p>And yet \u2026</p> <p>As I've written before, the Romney campaign's desperation now just makes me sad, and though I have trouble finding anything in his platform I can agree with (indeed, I've had trouble finding his platform, period), I've considered a \"pity vote\" for the guy. Considering I live in Minnesota, home of the polite smile, that could be the key to him carrying the state (where Obama currently <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/mn/minnesota_romney_vs_obama-1823.html\">leads</a> by eight points). A little more sympathy, and he could make sure he only loses by five.</p> <p>Heh-heh, that's all folks! Try the veal.</p>",
  "<p>The number of eligible Latino voters has reached a historic high, with almost 24 million able to participate in November's presidential election, an increase of 4 million over the previous ballot in 2008.</p> <p>The new figures, <a href=\"http://www.pewhispanic.org/2012/10/01/trends-in-latino-voter-registration/\">released by the Pew Hispanic Center</a>, underline the seismic demographic shift that is transforming the electoral landscape of the US. Over the past 20 years the number of Latinos eligible to vote has grown steadily and steeply, from 8.3 million in 1992 to 14.5 million in 2002 and 23.7 million in 2012 \u2013 some 11% of the current electorate.</p> <p>That is in turn a reflection of the growing numeric presence of Hispanics, who now stand as America's largest minority. Last year Latinos accounted for almost 17% of the population \u2013 some 52 million people.</p> <p>But Pew's research also underscores the unfulfilled nature of Latino political power. In 2008, only half those entitled to vote actually cast their ballots \u2013 a participation rate well beneath that of African Americans (65%) and whites (66%).</p> <p>The turnout of Hispanics in November could be even lower, as Census Bureau data suggests that the number of Latinos who are registered to vote actually declined by 600,000 between 2008 and 2010. Pew suggests the slump could be explained by a tailing off of political interest following the exceptional enthusiasm engendered by Obama's first run for the White House four years ago.</p> <p>It could also have something to do with the economic downturn. Many Hispanic families have been forced to move home because of foreclosures since the collapse of 2008, which in turn would have caused many of them to lose their electoral registration.</p> <p>Looked another way, though, and the statistics spell enormous potential rewards for any politician or political party who manages to release the Latino genie from the bottle. If Hispanic Americans can be persuaded that it is worth their while to turn up on election day, then there is room for a massive mobilisation of new voters.</p> <p>That is particularly the case in three vital swing states \u2013 Florida, which has more than 2 million eligible Hispanic voters, or 16% of the total; Colorado, with almost 500,000 (14%); and Nevada with 270,000 (15%). President Obama has been actively courting the Hispanic vote this year, with the introduction of a procedural change that allows young undocumented Latinos to apply for a two-year postponement of the threat of deportation.</p> <p>On the other hand, there is a further weakening of Hispanic political power because families are concentrated in states that are not significant battlegrounds this election cycle. More than half of all potential Latino voters live in three states that are not in play this November \u2013 firmly Democratic California and New York, and firmly Republican Texas.</p>",
  "<p>Amid the flurry of international concern over the European economic crisis, the American elections, the controversy surrounding Iran and the fallout from the Arab spring, it is important not to ignore Somalia. There is a rare opportunity taking shape there that deserves international support.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/28/somalia-overcoming-al-shabaab-threat\" title=\"\">crisis in Somalia</a> poses a danger not only to the Horn of Africa, but also to the security and economies of the world. Almost 50% of the world's maritime trade passes through the region, and the Somalian coast extends for 3,000 kilometres, from the straits of Aden to the Indian Ocean. Attacks by pirates cost the world economy more than $7bn annually, making the Somali crisis an international one.</p> <p>The Horn of Africa has become the military theatre with the widest array of international forces after Afghanistan. The US, China, Russia, Nato and the EU all maintain naval forces in the region to combat piracy. On the ground Ethiopian and African Union forces are mostly focused on safeguarding key locations in the capital, Mogadishu, and <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=al-Shabaab%20site:theguardian.com\" title=\"\">fighting al-Shabaab mujahideen in the south of the country</a>.</p> <p>Despite the complexity of the Somali problem, there have been several important developments in the past two months. The first was the drafting of a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-19075685\" title=\"\">new constitution</a> for the country; then there was the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/20/somalia-first-parliament-inaugurated\" title=\"\">appointment of 275 members to parliament</a>, whose formation all the clans agreed upon. That was followed by the dissolution of the transitional federal government, often described as weak and corrupt. On 10 September, the parliament elected a new president with a majority vote of 190 in a historic meeting that showed signs of national unity for the first time in many years.</p> <p>Last week I met a number of Somali politicians and activists in Mogadishu and came away with the impression that there was widespread optimism among the people after the election of Hassan Sheikh Mohamud as president. Now in his 50s, he is a former chancellor of the University of Somalia and has no record of political strife. Instead, he is known for his extensive work within civil society and for his efforts to bring about national reconciliation.</p> <p>The president is convinced of the need to rid Somali politics of clan loyalties, even though he belongs to the Hawiye, the largest clan in the country. Meanwhile, Mogadishu is enjoying a climate of relative calm, especially after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/16/q-a-somalia-al-shabaab\" title=\"\">al-Shabaab</a> withdrew its forces from the city. Immediately after the new president was elected, they tried to assassinate him by detonating a car bomb. Some of their cells are still active in Mogadishu, except that their ability to hold territory has suffered setbacks. The African Union forces continue to launch military operations against their strongholds, the last of which is the city of Kismayo, from which they have now withdrawn. On a regional level, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/21/meles-zenawi-death-instability-ethiopia\" title=\"\">death of the Ethiopian president, Meles Zenawi</a>, has restored hope for a more balanced relationship with Addis Ababa. Zenawi was never liked by the Somalis. He cemented fears among them of Ethiopia's imperial ambitions, especially after its recurrent military interventions in Somalia.</p> <p>I met Mohamud in his office in the presidential palace in Mogadishu. Naturally, there was nothing about it to suggest that it was presidential, or a palace. Some call it Villa Somalia. It is ensconced in a fortified military compound guarded by Ugandan and Somali forces. Within it are located most of the state agencies. It is a target of constant mujahideen attacks.</p> <p>It was very clear that the president is conscious of the enormous responsibility that rests on his shoulders: a state without institutions; a government without resources; a society torn apart by vicious wars; and perplexing regional and international intervention. Despite all this, he is still optimistic. His task in the immediate future is to form a national consensual government, one that will begin to build the organs of state as well as pursue a national reconciliation that will not exempt anyone, even al-Shabaab.</p> <p>But his country lacks the means, as well as genuine support. The international approach to Somalia requires a thorough reassessment. It has been confined to two priorities \u2013 terrorism and piracy \u2013 and has caused a wide cross-section of Somalis to view the international effort as a foreign occupation. Terrorism and piracy are symptoms of more fundamental and greater problems: the persistence of conflict and the absence of an authentic state infrastructure.</p> <p>At present the international community spends billions on ineffectual operations to secure commercial shipping against piracy. An equivalent amount is also spent on fighting armed groups and providing relief for people displaced by recurrent drought. But building a stable political system and establishing state infrastructure and an all-inclusive national reconciliation would be less costly and more beneficial for the region and the world.</p> <p>New players must therefore be encouraged to advance these new priorities; especially countries with historical, cultural and religious ties with Somalia. The Arab Gulf states with their vast financial resources can fulfil this role. As for post-revolution Egypt, it enjoys extensive respect among Somalis. This makes it possible for Egypt to exert significant influence towards reconciliation. The same applies to Turkey, which has a visible presence in Mogadishu through the projects initiated after the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14588960\" title=\"\">visit of its prime minister to the country</a> last year. On the regional level, South Africa can also play a major role in the forthcoming period.</p> <p>Much of the international effort has gone to waste in the past because of a lack of co-ordination, different agendas and discordant motives. The suggested path, one that focuses on state building and national reconciliation, does not contradict present efforts; it only complements them. The sensitivities of the various international parties must not prevent them from seizing this moment. Somalia today stands at the threshold of a new era. It needs effective regional and international support for its stability, territorial integrity and the security of its people.</p> <p>We must not miss this opportunity. If we do, the Somali conflict will infect many neighbouring countries like a virus and increase tensions in the Horn of Africa. Ultimately, global security and economic interests would suffer more setbacks and a deeper crisis.</p>",
  "<p>To subvert means to turn from below. We need a new word, which means to turn from above. The primary threat to the democratic state and its functions comes not from mob rule or leftwing insurrection, but from the very rich and the corporations they run.</p> <p>These forces have refined their assault on democratic governance. There is no need \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/jan/09/politics.past\" title=\"\">as Sir James Goldsmith, John Aspinall, Lord Lucan and others did in the 1970s</a> \u2013 to discuss the possibility of launching a military coup against the British government: the plutocrats have other means of turning it.</p> <p>Over the last few years I have been trying better to understand how the demands of big business and the very rich are projected into policymaking, and I have come to see the neoliberal thinktanks as central to this process. These are the groups which claim to champion the free market but whose proposals often look like a prescription for corporate power.</p> <p>David Frum, formerly a fellow of one of these thinktanks \u2013 the <a href=\"http://www.aei.org/\" title=\"\">American Enterprise Institute</a> \u2013 argues that they \"<a href=\"http://nymag.com/news/politics/conservatives-david-frum-2011-11/\" title=\"\">increasingly function as public relations agencies</a>\". But in this case, we don't know who the clients are. As the <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/30730535/Why-Think-Tanks-are-More-Effective\" title=\"\">corporate lobbyist Jeff Judson enthuses</a>, they are \"virtually immune to retribution \u2026 the identity of donors to thinktanks is protected from involuntary disclosure\". A consultant who worked for the billionaire Koch brothers <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/08/30/100830fa_fact_mayer?currentPage=all\" title=\"\">claims that they see the funding of thinktanks</a> \"as a way to get things done without getting dirty themselves\".</p> <p>This much I knew, but over recent days I've learned a lot more. In <a href=\"http://www.adamsmith.org/blog/miscellaneous/think-tank-%E2%80%93-the-story-of-the-adam-smith-institute\" title=\"\">Think Tank: the story of the Adam Smith Institute</a>, the institute's founder, Madsen Pirie, provides an unintentional but invaluable guide to how power in Britain really works.</p> <p>Soon after it was founded (in 1977), the institute approached \"all the top companies\". About 20 of them responded by sending cheques. Its most enthusiastic supporter was the coup plotter James Goldsmith, one of the most unscrupulous asset strippers of that time. Before making one of his donations, Pirie writes, \"he listened carefully as we outlined the project, his eyes twinkling at the audacity and scale of it. Then he had his secretary hand us a cheque for \u00a312,000 as we left\".</p> <p>From the beginning, senior journalists on the Telegraph, the Times and the Daily Mail volunteered their services. Every Saturday, in a wine bar called the Cork and Bottle, Margaret Thatcher's researchers and leader writers and columnists from the Times and Telegraph met staff from the Adam Smith Institute and the <a href=\"http://www.iea.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Institute of Economic Affairs</a>. Over lunch, they \"planned strategy for the week ahead\". These meetings would \"co-ordinate our activities to make us more effective collectively\". The journalists would then turn the institute's proposals into leader columns while the researchers buttonholed shadow ministers.</p> <p>Soon, Pirie says, the Mail began running a supportive article on the leader page every time the Adam Smith Institute published something. The paper's then editor, David English, oversaw these articles himself, and helped the institute to refine its arguments.</p> <p>As Pirie's history progresses, all references to funding cease. Apart from tickets donated by British Airways, no sponsors are named beyond the early 1980s. While the institute claims to campaign on behalf of \"the open society\", it is secretive and unaccountable. Today it <a href=\"http://www.monbiot.com/2011/09/12/think-of-a-tank/\" title=\"\">flatly refuses to say</a> <a href=\"http://whofundsyou.org/\" title=\"\">who funds it</a>.</p> <p>Pirie describes how his group devised and refined many of the headline policies implemented by Thatcher and John Major. He claims (and&#xa0;produces plenty of evidence to support it) either full or partial credit for the privatisation of the railways and&#xa0;other industries, for the contracting-out of public services to private companies, for the poll tax, the sale of council houses, the internal markets in education and health, the establishment of private prisons, GP fundholding and commissioning and, later, for George Osborne's tax policies.</p> <p>Pirie also wrote the manifesto of the neoliberal wing of Thatcher's government, No Turning Back. Officially, the authors of the document \u2013 which was published by the party \u2013 were MPs such as Michael Forsyth, Peter Lilley and Michael Portillo. \"Nowhere was there any mention of, or connection to, myself or the Adam Smith Institute. They paid me my \u00a31,000 and we were all happy.\" Pirie's report became the central charter of the doctrine we now call Thatcherism, whose praetorian guard called itself the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Turning_Back_(political_group)\" title=\"\">No Turning Back group</a>.</p> <p>Today's parliamentary equivalent is the <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">Free Enterprise Group</a>. Five of its members have just published a similar manifesto, Britannia Unchained. Echoing the narrative developed by the neoliberal thinktanks, they blame welfare payments and the mindset of the poor for the UK's appalling record on social mobility, suggest the need for much greater cuts and hint that the answer is the comprehensive demolition of the welfare system. It is subtler than No Turning Back. There are fewer of the direct demands and terrifying plans: these movements have learned something in the past 30 years.</p> <p>It is hard to think how their manifesto could have been better tailored to corporate interests. As if to reinforce the point, the cover carries a quote from Sir Terry Leahy, until recently the chief executive of Tesco: \"The path is clear. We have to be brave enough to take it.\"</p> <p>Once more the press&#xa0;has&#xa0;taken up the&#xa0;call. In the approach to publication, the Telegraph commissioned a <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/britain-unleashed-the-future-of/\" title=\"\">series of articles called Britain Unleashed</a>, promoting the same dreary agenda of less tax for the rich, less help for the poor and less regulation for business. Another article in the same paper, published a fortnight ago by its&#xa0;head of personal finance Ian Cowie, proposes that there be no representation without taxation. <a href=\"http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/finance/ianmcowie/100020160/is-mitt-romney-right-to-question-representation-without-taxation/\" title=\"\">People who don't&#xa0;pay enough income tax shouldn't be allowed to vote</a>.</p> <p>I see these people as rightwing vanguardists, mobilising first to break and then to capture a political system that is meant to belong to all of us. Like Marxist insurrectionaries, they often <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/britain-unleashed-the-future-of/9426472/Britain-Unleashed-David-Cameron-needs-a-change-of-heart-and-some-fire-in-his-belly.html\" title=\"\">talk about smashing things, about&#xa0;\"creative destruction\"</a>, about the breaking of chains and the slipping of leashes. But in this case they appear to be trying to free the rich from the constraints of democracy.

  "<p>The title of our new election interactive \u2013 \"Will your vote make the difference?\" \u2013 could mean a few different things, so let me explain exactly what we're trying to accomplish.</p> <p>The first thing you must know is that we're trying to determine the likelihood of a voter with certain characteristics having the chance of casting the tie-breaking vote this election. I believe that every vote matters, so we're not in any way seeking to imply that it's not worthwhile voting. But the outcome of the election almost certainly does not hinge on whether you vote or not.</p> <p>The second point rests on the premise that there isn't one presidential election on election day, but 51. Each state and the District of Columbia holds its own election for president. These votes matter because of something known as the electoral college. Because all 49 of the 51 contests are winner-takes-all (Maine and Nebraska being the exceptions), most electoral votes are pre-determined. We already know that President Obama will carry California and its 55 electoral votes, while Mitt Romney will take Texas and its 38 electoral votes.</p> <p>Thus, a 35-year-old college-educated black voter in the uncompetitive state of New York is far less important to the election than a voter with the same characteristics who resides in the swing state of Florida.</p> <p>Likewise, a state may be close at this moment, but that doesn't mean it's going to be the determinative one in the election. Right now, Obama holds a lead in the national and swing state polls. The closest state if the election were held today would likely be North Carolina. But that actually indicates North Carolina isn't likely going to be the difference maker.</p> <p>The most important state is the one that, if the electoral college race was extremely close, would be the likeliest of affecting the outcome of the presidential election if that state were to flip to the other candidate. We believe that state to be Ohio \u2013&#xa0;even if Obama leads there at the moment.</p> <p>The reason that we believe Ohio to be the ultimate swing state is that we're guided by the computations completed by Emory University professor and Votamatic founder Drew Linzer. Linzer was kind enough to compute, from his presidential state winner projections, the percentage chance that a state will flip the electoral college.</p> <p>After examining current state polling and historical trends, Linzer concluded that Ohio, with its relatively large share of 18 electoral college votes, is the state most likely to alter the election outcome if its winner changed.</p> <p>The third and final important point is that we're talking about a person with certain characteristics. Each individual's vote has the same chance of allowing one candidate to win than any other vote. But because there are more white than black voters in the swing states, there's a better chance that a white person's vote will determine the election than a black person's. We'd also expect that an older voter (one age 30 and older) has a better chance of casting the decisive vote \u2013 because there are more older voters in America.</p> <p>As you get more specific in your demographic selection, the percentage chance of a person with given characteristics deciding the election decreases significantly. We aren't just multiplying the percentage of Latino voters x male x college educated x 18-29-year-olds to figure out the percentage of Latino college males who are 18-29. We dug deep into the raw exit poll data to know the percentage of voters in a given state who met all these characteristics.</p> <p>Also, we're not trying to calculate the chance that one group's votes are up for grabs. White non-college graduates may have a better chance of changing their minds before the election than white college graduates. We aren't taking that into account.</p> <p>Our interactive is calculating a number derived from the following equation: the state's competitiveness factor \u2013 the chance that it will influence the winner \u2013 multiplied by each group's demographic percentage from 2008.</p> <p>[Note: some might argue the electorate will be different in 2008, but we're not sure. Rather than make an estimate we're not happy with, we're going to choose the neutral position of no change.]</p> <p>You can also choose not to pick a state. In that case, we are merely telling you the chance that a person with the given characteristics will determine the winner of the electoral college. The state competitiveness factor is still being taken into account, but it is the sum of voters who meet a given characteristic in all the states.</p> <p>The state competitive factor means that there is a 79% chance that a white voter will be the decisive voter in this election, which is 4 percentage points higher than the proportion of whites in US electorate at large. Latinos are only at 7%, versus the 8% of voters they were nationally in 2008, and blacks are only 11%, not the 12% of nationwide voters they were in 2008. The reason is that swing states tend to be whiter than the US as a whole.</p> <p>We hope that you'll let us know about your own interesting findings from our interactive, so do share your results with us on Facebook and Twitter.</p>",
  "<p>Last week at the UN general assembly, the Lancet medical journal, with the Rockefeller Foundation and Results for Development, officially launched its series on universal health coverage \u2013 an idea whose time appears to have come, or perhaps returned. While the political battles are still raging in the US over access to healthcare and will continue to do so at least until Barack Obama or Mitt Romney is elected, most countries are moving towards a system that allows those who need medical treatment, but cannot afford it, to get it. </p> <p>There were some raised eyebrows, however, over the name of the man who led the Lancet series. It was David de Ferranti, now president of the Results for Development Institute but, in the 1980s, a staff member of the World Bank and one of the chief proponents of the introduction of user fees.</p> <p>This is what he wrote in 1985 in the abstract of his bank staff working paper, entitled Paying for Health Services in Developing Countries, which reviewed \"the shortcomings of existing policies, which finance healthcare to a significant extent from public revenue sources\" and looked at alternative options:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The conclusions argue that present policies need to be substantially reoriented in many countries. The conventional and still growing faith that healthcare should be totally paid for and administered by government needs to be vigorously challenged.</p> </blockquote> <p>He cautions that extreme care must be taken in developing alternative strategies and adds that a different approach needs to be taken to preventive medicine \u2013 such as immunisations. He goes on:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Within this context of reform tailored to service-specific factors, there appears to be considerable scope for having users bear a larger share of healthcare costs, preferably through a combination of fees for services and fees for coverage, rather than either alone. The most clear-cut target for greater cost recovery is non-referral curative care, which together with referral services accounts for over two-thirds of health expenditure. Fees for many preventive services should remain below marginal private cost, and in some cases should be zero or even negative (ie, there should be incentive payments). </p> </blockquote> <p>Some of the NGOs that have protested over the World Bank's attitude towards user fees in the past (the bank has now changed its stance) think the Lancet pieces suggest de Ferranti has undergone a Damascene conversion.</p> <p>This is <a href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2812%2961340-3/fulltext\">from one of them</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For a long time, getting healthcare has meant first paying a fee to the provider \u2013 a practice that effectively burdens sick and needy people, a small and vulnerable segment of the population, with most of the healthcare costs. For many poor people, that has meant choosing between going without needed services or facing financial ruin. Paying out of pocket is still dominant worldwide. In India, for example, patient fees account for more than 60% of health expenditure.</p> <p>Countries moving towards universal health coverage, including India, are seeking to change this situation. By spreading the costs across the whole population, everyone would pay less in times of ill-health and those in need of treatment for serious illnesses would be spared from crushingly high costs. Illness would no longer regularly bring financial catastrophe.</p> </blockquote> <p>I asked de Ferranti about the series and his support for universal health coverage today in the light of his rejection of it in the 1980s. He sees no inconsistency. He says the world has changed in 30 years. The situation then is not the one that pertains now:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><br>If you go back to that time, the actual point that I was making was different than just saying user fees are good. I recognise that other voices in the bank and other voices talking about the bank put it that way. But the point I was making was if there is no money to get healthcare to remote areas, to poor areas or to rural areas, then the cry for free healthcare for all means no healthcare for many. And so it wasn't a sense that user fees are good in their own right but with so few resources available, one needs to look to \u2013 that was the argument being made then \u2013 those who can pay, so that those who cannot pay would be more able to get services. That's the argument that was being made.</p> <p>Since then \u2013 I guess it is now 30 years \u2013 economic growth rates, higher incomes, all the forces that have led to this florescence of interest and action by countries towards universal healthcare [have] shown that more resources were available and more that could be applied to health \u2013 so that older argument no longer applies. The world has completely changed. Thirty years. Three decades. That's a long time. Things change and arguments should change. And in the presence of more resources and the ability not just financially but administratively of countries to manage these programmes, which was again not there 30 years ago, it just now makes eminent sense and I have been outspoken in this \u2013 to move towards universal health coverage systems.</p> </blockquote> <p>Rick Rowden, author of The Deadly Ideas of Neoliberalism and a harsh critic of the user fees policy of the past, says de Ferranti and others who took a similar line were simply part of their era \u2013 \"riding the political wave of the time \u2013 Reagan, Thatcher and the free market\". </p> <p>\"I'm sure he is completely sincere,\" said Rowden. \"I'm sure he has always meant well.\" He does not blame de Ferranti but, he says, the prevailing economic ideas had \"tremendous impact on people's lives over many years\". He speaks of the \"reckless\" introduction of user fees, which should have been tested out on small groups of people first, and says that later on it should have been clear that they were undermining people's human right to health. </p> <p>\"I'm more interested in acknowledging the victims of this 30-year economic mistake,\" he said. They could have a case for compensation, he says. At the international conference on primary healthcare at Alma Ata in 1978, there was a consensus on the need for universal healthcare, but the movement was derailed by the neoliberal dominance of the 1980s. \"From Alma Ata to 2012 is 34 years. That is outrageous. It is amazing to think how many people must have suffered.\"</p>",
  "<p>'Help, help, help!\" screams a cartoon Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, dropping his watering can and running for dear life as a giant dollar sign totters alarmingly and threatens to crush him. Attacks like these are multiplying as criticism mounts over the mismanagement of Iran's worsening economic plight. With the rial plummeting against the dollar, accusations that the president is deliberately manipulating Iran's foreign currency reserves \u2013 hence the watering can \u2013 reflect discontent among ordinary people who can no longer afford staple foods or find decent jobs.</p> <p>Ahmadinejad has been mired in controversy from his election in 2005, a populist figure who has been both publicly backed and privately vilified by the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and the Islamic republic's hardline clerical establishment. Only last week, as Ahmadinejad was addressing the UN general assembly, his own media adviser was arrested.</p> <p>He also faced angry criticism over the 140-strong entourage that accompanied him to the UN. But his speech in New York lacked the familiar fireworks, and an interview with one US newspaper sounded almost conciliatory on the burning question of Iran's nuclear programme \u2013 the reason for some of the toughest international sanctions ever imposed.</p> <p>Economists agree that the currency crisis has been triggered by financial sanctions which, on top of a huge reduction in oil revenues from the EU, make it harder for Iran to carry on injecting petrodollars into markets to keep exchange rates down. \"What is making it worse is that the country is plagued by a power struggle between Ahmadinejad and Khamenei,\" says one Iranian analyst, \"so instead of handling the crisis the president is preoccupied by the arrest of his press adviser and the central bank seems completely undecided and shifts from one policy to another.\"</p> <p>Ahmadinejad, banned from standing for a third term, is widely seen as yesterday's man. Mir-Hossein Mousavi, who claimed victory in 2009, remains under house arrest. In March's majlis elections, Khamenei loyalists swept the board.</p> <p>The president has severe image problems in the west, especially when he excoriates \"Zionists\" or hails the \"hidden imam\" of Shia Muslim tradition, but he has been more pragmatic than Khamenei on the need to ease tensions with the west. No surprise that he is at loggerheads with the Revolutionary Guards, who seem to welcome an attack by Israel or the US.</p> <p>Western governments appear to be hoping that the sanctions will encourage popular unrest and a policy shift. But repression has been successful \u2013 far more than in Syria \u2013 and there seems little appetite for mass protests. Media outlets have been officially ordered to avoid \"bleak\" reporting about the economy and to robustly defend the Islamic Revolution.</p> <p>\"What is happening now is that anyone who is unhappy with the economy and resorts to protests can be easily labelled as damaging national security,\" warns a veteran Tehran-watcher. \"So this tactic by the big powers of encouraging a popular uprising effectively forces Iranians to shut up.\"</p> <p>Ali Ansari of the University of St Andrews argues that the Iranian government has now lost all credibility on economic management with its people, not least because there are no independent means of accounting and auditing. \"Iranian politicians have been quite lucky \u2013 especially Ahmadinejad,\" he says. \"But all of a sudden there are no more miracles around the corner \u2013 unless you think that the hidden imam is about to come.\"</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama has lost the first round in the run-up to the presidential debate in Denver on Wednesday, with a poll showing his campaign team failed in the contest to play down expectations. </p> <p>Both the Obama and Mitt Romney campaign teams for the last fortnight have been trying to lower expectations about their respective candidates and talking up their opponents.</p> <p>In spite of this, an ABC/Washington Post poll showed that registered voters by a two to one margin expect Obama to win the crucial debate. </p> <p>The figures can be read as a vote of confidence in Obama, an expectation that he is a better performer than Romney, often portrayed as \"wooden\" as a speaker. But there is a big downside for Obama going into a debate as favourite in a debate estimated to attract a viewing audience of between 50-60 million. </p> <p>If the debate is judged to be a draw or even a win for Obama, that outcome would be largely discounted because he fulfilled expectations. By contrast, with expectations of Romney low, even a modest performance could be potrayed by his team as win.</p> <p>Obama is ensconced in a resort on the outskirts of Las Vegas, preparing for the debate while Romney has opted to base himself in Denver.</p> <p>Obama, in his final rally in Las Vegas on Sunday night before retreating into purdah, made a last attempt to lower expectations. </p> <p>\"I know folks in the media are speculating already on who's going to have the best zingers,\" he said. The crowd shouted: \"You are.\"</p> <p>Obama replied: \"I don't know about that. Governor Romney, he's a good debater.\"</p> <p>Romney badly needs a good showing to reverse the growing perception that he is a loser, after setback after setback, from his overseas trip in the summer to an uninspired convention. He was not helped by the 47% secret video a fortnight ago, or recent polls in swing states putting Obama ahead.</p> <h2>Republican strategy emerges</h2> <p>In a preview of what lines of attack he might pursue on Wednesday, the Republican party put out a lengthy press release listing issues on which it claimed Obama had abused trust, including immigration, the deficit and renewable energy.</p> <p>Romney's campaign team is divided over strategy for the remaining five weeks, particularly over how hard to pursue the shifting White House version of events of the Libyan killings.</p> <p>Some of his advisers want to keep the focus almost exclusively on the economy, seeing that as the key to eventual victory on November 6. Others argue that the unrest in Libya and elsewhere in the Middle East offers a badly-needed opportunity to shake up the election race.</p> <p>There will, in theory, be little opportunity to make the Wednesday debate about foreign policy, having agreed in advance to devote it to domestic issues and leave foreign policy to the third and final debate.</p> <p>Romney, in an article in the Wall Street Journal published Monday, reiterated his argument that Obama had failed in the Middle East by not staying close enough to Israel, by being too weak in the showdown with Iran and by failing to make the most of the Arab Spring. </p> <p>Referring to the killing of US ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans at the consulate in Benghazi, Libya, he wrote: \"We needed a strategy for success, but the president offered none. And now he seeks to downplay the significance of the calamities of the past few weeks.\"</p> <p>The White House, the state department and the US mission at the UN <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/30/white-house-defends-un-ambassador-benghazi\">have veered between</a> ascribing the Benghazi attack to militia spontaneously taking advantage of a riot over anti-Muslim film to a pre-planned assault by a group linked to al-Qaida.</p> <p>The ABC-Washington Post poll, in line with others over the last fortnight, show Obama ahead. Sixty-three percent of registered voters said they expect he will win re-election and 56% to 29% expect him to win the Denver debate.<br>Although Obama is ahead nationally, it is only by 49% to 47%, a small enough margin for Romney to mount a comeback. </p> <p>A poll in Iowa, for the Des Moines Register, which has a good record of accuracy, shows Obama ahead 49% to 45%, good news for him but a small enough margin for Romney to turn around one of the swing states.</p> <p>In a new line of attack, the Democrats are sending out squads of legislators and officials from Massachusetts to swing states to talk about their experience of Romney when he was governor of the state.</p>",
  "<p>\u2022\u2009Sharp but blunt union boss, Len McCluskey of Unite, gave the conference a rip-roaring denunciation of banks, coalitions and \"the siren voices\" of neo-liberalism. But the big three unions' other general secretaries, Paul Kenny of the GMB and Unison's Dave Prentis, have been telling comrades in the bar that Len himself proved susceptible to the neo-liberal siren voice of Rupert Murdoch ahead of the conference. McCluskey's Sunday Times interview was hyped into a predictable \"unions to seize control of world\" page one headline \u2013 as Kenny and Prentis guessed it would be. Both men turned the paper down.</p> <p>Tony Blair's former press chief Alastair Campbell is \"thinking about\" standing for election at the next general election, he revealed yesterday. Asked on LBC radio whether he had ambitions to become an MP, he said: \"All I'll say to you is I get a lot of people asking me, particularly when I'm up here, and I do think about it and I am thinking about it and I don't think there's a fantastic rush.

It comes together as an Iced Vimto Parfait.</p> <p>\u2022\u2009The unmentionable Blair was always slightly suspicious of New Labour's polling guru, the late Philip Gould, so Alastair Campbell admitted at the launch of essays in his memory. Why? Because his focus groups always seemed to say what Gould thought. Gould used to warm up such groups with matey questions like: \" Your name is Jane? My first girlfriend was called Jane. She went on to commit suicide.\" Just the remark to thaw the ice.</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Good day:</strong> Jim Murphy. The shadow defence secretary introduced a platoon of military (Veterans for Labour) speakers after making a capable speech himself without notes. Murphy even remembered to praise the armed forces (unlike Mitt Romney, who forgot).</p> <p>\u2022 <strong>Bad day:</strong> Ad agency M&amp;C Saatchi. It produced the poster being driven around Manchester on a truck, depicting the two Eds, Miliband and Balls as gormless schoolboys. The accompanying slogan \"Labour Isn't Learning\" echoes the Saatchis' glory days in 1979. But Tory moneybags Lord Ashcroft has denounced it as a juvenile waste of cash. Ouch!</p>",

Reagan responded with one of his best remembered lines, saying he would not \"exploit for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience\".

Barton was one of 58 people wounded, along with 12 killed, when a gunman opened fire in an Aurora cinema on the opening night of The Dark Knight Rises on 20 July.</p> <p>The Century 16 movie theater is located just 10 miles away from the University of Denver where Barack Obama and Mitt Romney will go head to head. In a quirk of scheduling, the first TV debate will also take place about 10 miles in the other direction from Columbine high school where the 1999 rampage claimed 13 lives.</p> <p>Barton believes that the confluence of geography is too great to ignore. \"I want to see the moderator on Wednesday night ask the candidates what policies they would implement as president to prevent future tragedies like Aurora and Columbine, and then push them on it.</p> <p>\"I want to hear serious discussion beyond just lamenting the fact that they happened.\"</p> <p>Barton has joined forces with <a href=\"http://www.mayorsagainstillegalguns.org/html/home/home.shtml\">Mayors Against Illegal Guns</a>, a coalition of 725 mayors from towns and cities across America that campaigns for tighter vetting procedures to prevent criminals, domestic violence offenders and people with severe mental illnesses from acquiring firearms. He <a href=\"http://www.demandaplan.org/aurora\">appears in a new TV ad</a> in which he sits in an empty cinema, much like the one in Aurora, and warns that unless changes are made the equivalent of more than 200 packed theaters \u2013 some 48,000 Americans \u2013 will die from gun violence during the next president's four-year term.</p> <p>\"I do expect the candidates to be confronted about this issue, and I'll certainly be disappointed if they aren't,\" he said in an interview with the Guardian.</p> <h2>'It should certainly be on the minds of Americans'</h2> <p>A string of coincidences brought Barton, 22, to the Aurora cinema that fateful night. A graduate of Syracuse University, he was coming towards the end of a coast-to-coast cycle ride across America which he was making with his friend Ethan Rodriguez-Torrent.</p> <p>Reaching Denver after 2,750 miles, they bought three tickets to the premier showing of The Dark Knight Rises. The third ticket was a thank-you present for their host, a woman who had read about their cross-country ride on Facebook and contacted them out of the blue to offer them hospitality.</p> <p>About 15 minutes in to the film, Barton noticed a streak across the screen and some flashes of light in the corner of the cinema. He assumed it was fireworks, until the screaming started.</p> <p>Almost immediately, he was hit by 25 pellets from the shooter's rifle. One hit him in the face, and five in the neck, entering perilously close to vital arteries; the scar tracks are from surgery to remove the pellets.</p> <p>Rodriguez-Torrent escaped injury, but their host was struck by a pellet that entered her naval cavity and transversed her brain, lodging at the back of her skull. Miraculously, its path managed to avoid crucial areas of the brain, and she is making a good recovery.</p> <p>\"Naturally, I feel strange about her, and I sometimes wonder how her family sees my friend and me. After all, she was there in the cinema because we were there,\" Barton says.</p> <p>Until the tragedy, he had never been actively engaged in the issue of gun control. \"Like most people I thought this was never going to happen to me, so I didn't have to worry about it.\"</p> <p>Now he reflects on the 34 people who lose their lives every day in the US because of gun violence and is determined to do something about it. \"That's a big number. It should certainly be on the minds of Americans even if it's not something they have to deal with personally.\"</p> <p>The new TV advert featuring Barton is part of the <a href=\"www.DemandAPlan.org\">Demand a Plan</a> campaign that brings Mayors Against Illegal Guns together with the survivors of rampages and victims families to call for a concrete legislative plan to reduce the annual carnage. Its petition has been signed by more than 250,000.</p> <p>Specifically, the campaign wants to see background checks extended to all gun owners.</p> <p>Currently, about 40% of guns are sold by private sellers and do not require a background check under federal law.</p> <p>The suspect in the murders, James Holmes, had undergone vetting when he bought a rifle, shotgun and two handguns. It is not yet known, however, whether signs he displayed before the shooting of a vulnerable mental state were reported to authorities.</p> <p>Barton is still undergoing physical therapy for the result of his wounds and has delayed by a year a Fulbright scholarship to Russia to teach English. He says he is fully aware of the political hurdles in Washington to confronting gun safety, but adds that the stasis in Congress will not deter him from demanding action.</p> <p>\"I've come to the conclusion that if I \u2013 someone shot in one of these gun tragedies \u2013 was not prepared to talk about this, then I couldn't be frustrated about the lack of political discourse in Washington,\" he says.</p>",

A great deal has changed in the Virginia town of Roanoke \u2013 a swing area in a swing state \u2013 since I spent three weeks there <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/sep/29/younge.america.roanoke.virginia\">during the last presidential election</a>. Back then <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2008/sep/30/roanoke\">I asked a black woman</a> if she thought Virginia would elect a black man to the presidency. She paused for five seconds. \"If they really know how things are now they would \u2026 They should,\" she said desperately trying to convince herself.</p> <p>They did. But back then Obama supporters dared not believe it even as they worked night and day to achieve it. The Obama campaign office <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2008/oct/06/uselections2008.barackobama\">fizzed with excitement</a>, reviving the energy of those who had previously been disaffected with politics and drawing in new blood from people who had never been interested. People travelled hundreds of miles from all over the country to volunteer in the town.</p> <p>There were a range of reasons for this, not least that he would be the first black president and that his election signalled a departure from the war and the oligarchic impulses of the previous eight years.</p> <p>But the celebrations <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/article/what-obama-means-world\">went way beyond the Blue Ridge Mountains</a> in which Roanoke nestles. Throughout the Caribbean radios blared Mighty Sparrow's calypso hit Barack the Magnificent; firecrackers went off in El Salvador; Liberians danced in the street. In Ghana the late John Atta Mills ran for the presidency with posters of himself standing next to a life-size cutout of Obama and won. In Brazil, at least eight black candidates took advantage of a quirk in electoral laws so they could stand as \"Barack Obama\" in elections in October.</p> <p>This global outpouring was more than just a response against Bush (it's difficult to believe there would have been such an outpouring if John Kerry had won in 2004). At a time when electoral turnout was declining across most of the western world and disaffection with political classes was at its height, the energy invested in him in Roanoke and projected onto him from afar marked resurrection of the fundamental notion that elections could change things and, in so doing, reconnect popular will to political power through electoral politics.</p> <p>\"People have been excited by Obama's candidacy but also by working together,\" <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/nov/10/barack-obama-supporters-campaign\">said Brian Corr</a>, who'd been volunteering between 10 and 15 hours a day from his home in Boston for more than 18 months. \"Organised people are more powerful than organised money \u2026 we need to make sure that all that hope that we have talked about and seen is channelled in a progressive way.\"</p> <p>Given the glaring flaws in American democracy, notably the influence of money and lobbyists, one can debate whether that sense of empowerment was well placed. Obama was not the head of a movement but a well co-ordinated campaign. Those involved had no ownership of it. When the election was over the offices in Roanoke closed and the staffers left, never to return again. But there was no doubt that people did feel empowered.</p> <p>***</p> <p>The most marked political change in the last four years is the degree to which those who were once politically engaged no longer have that sense of possibility. Every Obama supporter I met in 2008 was less involved now than they were then. Most were not involved at all. Many had their reasons, primarily work and children. All of them thought he was certain to win, which may have been a factor. And it would be difficult to replicate the excitement of that election. In the words of Sade: \"It's never as good as the first time.\"</p> <p>But underpinning it all was a general sense of ennui not with him in particular \u2013 they all still loved him \u2013 but with politics in general: a sense that there was little point in investing energy in a political class or much faith in the electoral process that produces them. \"I never thought things could become more divided, and there be more fighting,\" says Ann Trinkel, echoing the frustrations of many. \"But oh my gosh it's just \u2026 gridlock. And I guess that's what sort of lessened the hopefulness for me, and made me a bit more cynical, is all the money.\"</p> <p>It's not difficult to see why. The day I arrived in Roanoke in 2008 Congress voted against the bailout. It felt as though you could look out of your hotel window and see the nation's economy implode. Wachovia bank, the area's fourth largest employer whose name was emblazoned on top of the town's only skyscraper <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/oct/06/usa.useconomy\">had been laid low by bad debts</a> and was the subject of an emergency rescue. In 2008 one in eight families in Roanoke lived below the poverty line and the town's median income was three-quarters the national average. </p> <p>Today one in five live in poverty and income is 70% of the national average. In the year before Obama was inaugurated <a href=\"http://www.roanoke.com/news/breaking/wb/197663\">unemployment there leapt</a> from 3.6% to 6.5%. <a href=\"http://www.roanoke.com/news/breaking/wb/197663\">Today it is 6.4%</a>. The haemorrhaging has stopped but for many a slow death continues. True, it could be worse. But that was not the rally cry four years ago. Some of those who bought into the promise of change could be forgiven for demanding a refund.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Nationally, the overwhelming majority of Americans still believe the country is on the wrong track and <a href=\"http://thehill.com/conventions-2012/dem-convention-charlotte/247263-hill-poll-voters-think-second-term-undeserved\">a narrow majority believe Obama does not deserve a second term</a>. In the four years between when he first declared his candidacy and the mid-terms in 2010 the median American family <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/fed-americans-wealth-dropped-40-percent/2012/06/11/gJQAlIsCVV_story.html\">lost a generation of wealth</a>. Wages are stagnant, unemployment high, social mobility slowing, poor white women are <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/21/us/life-expectancy-for-less-educated-whites-in-us-is-shrinking.html\">dying earlier than their mothers did</a> and the gap between black and white is growing. <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/magazine/winning-has-become-not-losing-20120927\">A recent poll revealed</a> that a slim majority of Americans define success as 'not falling behind'. </p> <p>\"They talk about the rich and the middle class \u2026 they never talk about poverty. We're living in total poverty. We have nothing right now,\" said Robin Barbour four years ago in Roanoke. Back then she was living with her partner Fred Crews in his mother's basement and volunteering for the Obama campaign. Since Obama's been president <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/video/2008/jan/23/america.poverty\">poverty has increased around 14%</a> but he's not delivered a single speech on poverty and mentioned the word just three times in all his state of the union speeches.</p> <p>Few, even among his own supporters, believe Obama re-election will actually reverse these trends. They just think Romney will accelerate and exacerbate them. He is winning at present not because most people think he has done a great job (though many Obama supporters do) but because they think he's done <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/17/barack-obama-election-gary-younge\">the best job he could under the circumstances</a>. The trouble is it is precisely those circumstances \u2013 gridlock, big money, polarisation \u2013 that are turning them off and with the Republicans set to retake the House and possibly the Senate those circumstances are going to get worse.</p> <p>That's not to say that nothing has changed or that it makes no difference who wins. In Roanoke, Chelsea's son, Harrison, was born with two heart defects. Prior to Obama's healthcare reforms that could have meant a life of penury in which he could either be denied health insurance because of a pre-existing condition, had to pay exorbitant rates or faced a lifetime cap on the amount his insurance provider would pay to cover him. Such changes, along with his executive order to halt the deportation of thousands of young undocumented immigrants or the Lily Ledbetter Act, protecting equal pay for equal work, or the repeal of don't ask don't tell for gays in the military makes a crucial difference to many people's lives.</p> <p>So while one may argue that Obama's impact has been too incremental or insufficient, it is untenable to claim that he has made no impact and no difference. Both parties have framed the coming five weeks as a choice between two different visions of the country. There is some truth to that. But beyond the vague notion of 'more fairness' or 'less government' few could tell you what those visions are. The problem is that neither choice actually answers the central and enduring problems the country is facing. Like Seinfeld, this election campaigns have become a show about nothing.</p> <p>Meanwhile the electoral industrial complex keeps churning out polls and analysis as though on a split screen, making the contest not about who or what will or could change but just who will win, where and by how much. The horse race is <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/sep/01/uselections2008.usa \">seductive and not entirely avoidable</a>. </p> <p>But my aim is to report from the other screen: where people live, love, survive and \u2013 all too rarely at present \u2013 thrive. To move beyond and between the narrow lens of two parties, fuelled by gaffes and donors, to gauge what people thought would change, think of what has changed and what they would like to change. To see to what extent they think this election will make a difference to their lives and what, if anything, that tells them about the state of the country they live in.</p>",
  "<p>US manufacturing activity expanded in September after shrinking for three consecutive months, according to a nationwide poll from the Institute for Supply Management.</p> <p>The results of <a href=\"http://www.ism.ws/ISMReport/MfgROB.cfm?navItemNumber=12942\">ISM's closely watched monthly survey</a> were far better than economists had been expecting, with most predicting another month of contraction. The purchasing managers index (PMI), which reflects the acquisition of goods and services, was 51.5 in September \u2013 any figure above 50 represents growth. It stood at 49.6 in August.</p> <p>Dan Greenhaus, chief global strategist at BTIG, said the report was \"unquestionably positive\". US stocks markets rose on the news.</p> <p>The numbers come amid mixed signals about the fragile recovery in the US economy. Last week the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/27/us-gdp-growth-estimate-revised-down\">US downgraded its economic forecasts</a> for growth in the second quarter. But there were signs that the housing market is finally on the mend. Ahead of ISM's latest release economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires had forecast PMI would come in at 49.5.</p> <p>In a note to clients, Greenhaus wrote: \"Along with a number of other indicators, the recent weakening of the ISM manufacturing index has led several clients to inquire as to whether the US was falling into recession. Today's number dampens that question for sure but may not squash it altogether.\"</p> <p>Of the 18 manufacturing industries surveyed, 11 reported growth in September, including textile mills, food and beverages, apparel, paper products, petroleum and coal. Six industries reported contraction in September including transportation equipment. Last week the commerce department reported a 13.2% drop in durable goods orders in September, the largest fall since January 2009, driven down largely by falling orders for civil aircraft.</p> <p>The ISM report contains quotes from executives across a range of industries that appear once more to underline the mixed picture of the economy. \"[It] appears that our so-called 'slowdown' was a summer thing. September brings with it increasing requirements and business,\" said an executive in the paper products industry. \"Sales have tanked over the last two months, bringing a very concerned and stressed management team. Not very optimistic for the near-term future,\" said an executive in apparel, leather and allied products.</p> <p>The ISM figures come days before president Barack Obama and rival Mitt Romney clash in their first debate, a face-off that is expected to focus on the state of the US economy. On Friday the bureau of labor statistics will release its latest non-farm payroll figures, a monthly snapshot of the US jobs market that has become a electoral flashpoint in the 2012 campaign.</p>",
  "<p>The United States has warned European governments against supporting a Palestinian bid for enhanced status at the United Nations, saying such a move \"would be extremely counterproductive\" and threatening \"significant negative consequences\" for the Palestinian Authority, including financial sanctions.</p> <p>A US memorandum, seen by the Guardian, said Palestinian statehood \"can only be achieved via direct negotiations with the Israelis\" and urged European governments \"to support [American] efforts\" to block the bid. The message was communicated by officials to representatives of European governments at the UN general assembly (UNGA) in New York last week.</p> <p>Palestinian officials accused the US of exerting \"tremendous pressure\" on European governments to oppose their bid for upgraded \"non-member state\" status at the UNGA. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2012/sep/28/palestinian-president-abbas-un-video\" title=\"\">Announced by president Mahmoud Abbas last week (video)</a>, the move is a significant diminution of Palestinian ambitions after its application for full statehood failed last year when it was blocked by the US in the security council.</p> <p>The Palestinians will wait until after the US presidential election in early November before proceeding with their bid for upgraded status. However, they insist they will press for a vote by the end of the year and are confident of winning a comfortable majority among the UN's 193 countries. The US has no veto at the general assembly.</p> <p>The memorandum \u2013 described by one diplomatic source as \"private correspondence\" \u2013 said the US was continuing to work for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and urged both parties \"to avoid provocative one-sided actions that could undermine trust or otherwise distract from the pursuit of peace\".</p> <p>A Palestinian resolution on non-member state status \"would have significant negative consequences, for the peace process itself, for the UN system, as well as our ability to maintain our significant financial support for the Palestinian Authority\".</p> <p>It added that a successful resolution could lead to Palestinian participation as a state in international bodies such as the international criminal court. Israel is concerned that Palestinian recourse to the ICC could have repercussions for its policies on settlements, the occupation of the West Bank and the blockade of Gaza.</p> <p>\"We believe your government understands what is at stake here, and \u2013 like us \u2013 wants to avoid a collision at the coming UNGA session,\" said the text. \"We hope you are willing to support our efforts&#xa0;\u2026 We would appreciate knowing where your government stands on this issue. We would also be interested in knowing whether you have been approached on this matter by Palestinian representatives.\"</p> <p>Hanan Ashwari, a member of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation executive committee, described the memorandum as \"typical American behaviour but also overkill\".</p> <p>\"It is ridiculous and unconscionable the way they put themselves at the service of Israel in such a blatant way. This is tremendous American pressure and bias.\"</p> <p>She said most European countries had already decided their position on the issue: \"I don't think [the US] will make countries change their minds.\"</p> <p>Saeb Erekat, the Palestinian chief negotiator, said the memorandum reflected the US position but he hoped that \"the Europeans will follow their interests and choose peace over settlements\".</p> <p>One European diplomat said that, until recently, US officials believed a \"diplomatic ceasefire\" was in force and that the Palestinians would not pursue the statehood issue at the general assembly. But pressure from street protests in the West Bank in recent weeks had stiffened Abbas's resolve, and the current consensus among diplomats was that the Palestinians were determined to press ahead.</p> <p>There were differing views among European countries on the wisdom of the Palestinians' move, the diplomat added. \"The closer we get to the prospect of a vote in the UN general assembly, the more concerned the US administration is likely to be. This letter is an expression of their well-known position against such a vote. But if we are to persuade Abbas not to pull the trigger, a serious alternative needs to be put on the table, and fast.\"</p> <p>A second European diplomat said the US had \"made it very clear to all of us that they're opposed to any [Palestinian] move at the UN\". He also criticised the Palestinians for not engaging in \"serious, high-level diplomacy\" on the issue.</p> <p>Some European countries are alarmed at the prospect of the US withdrawing financial support for the Palestinian Authority in the wake of a bid for upgraded status, fearing that the EU would have to fill the funding gap.</p> <p>Following the Palestinians' acceptance as a state by the United Nations cultural and heritage body, Unesco, the US cut off funding as a punitive measure. The US had contributed 22% of Unesco's annual budget.</p> <p>Discussions among European governments on whether to support the Palestinians' bid are due to be held this week. However the 27 member states are unlikely to forge a common line.</p> <p>The US state department declined to comment on the memorandum.</p>",

  "<p></p> <h2>Monday</h2> <h2>Masters Of Money<br>9pm, BBC2</h2> <p>In the final part of this timely series, BBC economics editor Stephanie Flanders urges us to shrug off our shackles and storm the barricades. Or at least asks us to consider whether Karl Marx had a point. The 19th-century German intellectual, of course, argued that while capitalism needed to be swept away, it would collapse by itself in any case. Flanders wonders whether his theories might provide answers to the mess we're now in \u2013 and also attempts to separate his economic analysis from atrocities committed in his name. <em>Ali Catterall</em></p> <h2>Monroe<br>9pm, ITV1</h2> <p>James Nesbitt's brain surgeon/miracle worker/purveyor of witty one-liners returns for a new series of the medical drama. There's a new boss at St Matthews and Bremner (the deadpan Sarah Parish) is back from maternity leave. Monroe, as ever, has a lot of dilemmas that make him stare into a glass of red wine and raise one eyebrow thoughtfully. First up is a young man with a brain condition other doctors deem too risky to operate on \u2013 will Monroe <br>give him a chance under the scalpel? At home, his ex-wife has a new boyfriend and his son unleashes some controversial news. <em>Hannah Verdier</em></p> <h2>Hotel GB<br>9pm, Channel 4</h2> <p>It's difficult enough to imagine potential viewers \u2013 not to mention participants \u2013 steeling themselves for yet another iteration of the fish-out-of-water reality format.The conceit this time is that some of Channel 4's best-known facces will pretend to staff the titular hotel \u2013 Gordon Ramsay running the restaurant, Mary Portas stewarding the rooms, Kirstie Allsopp serving as concierge, etc. The veneer of higher purpose will also be applied, in the form of training for job-seekers. Andrew Mueller</p> <h2>Threesome<br>9.30pm, Comedy Central</h2> <p>The affable comedy returns for its second series bolstered by a new cast of sitcom heavyweights, with Bill Bailey, Robert Webb and The Inbetweeners' Joe Thomas all lining up to appear. Now that baby Lily has been born, Mitch is going back to school for his maths GCSE so he can start a teacher training course. But there's a whole new world of slang, bullying and a surname easily turned into Penis to deal with. The jokes are never subtle, but there's something about the titular Threesome that's likable enough to make it work. <em>Rebecca Nicholson</em></p> <h2>My Brother, The Murderer<br>10.05pm, More4</h2> <p>This wonderfully touching but strangely truncated 30-minute film follows 30-year-old Natasha Owen Jones, a woman who has spent two decades searching for a brother she has never met. Her brother Morgan was adopted before she was born. Natasha was also later adopted and, while she stayed in the UK, he was taken to the US by his new family. Last year, she finally found him, only to discover that he is serving a 99-year sentence for first degree murder in a Minnesota prison. She travels to the US where she meets Morgan for the first time. <em>Ben Arnold</em></p> <h2>George H W Bush<br>10.15pm, PBS</h2> <p>Part of a series of documentaries on American presidents, this examination of the ex-CIA director turned national leader advances the suggestion that having taken the low road to power, he was governed by his conscience while in the White House. Some would splutter in incredulity at that, and wonder what there is to say about this morally inert suit-filler other than that he was marginally less appalling than his son. This documentary, however, reveals a complex and contradictory man, whose single term as president between 1988 and 1992 was historically momentous.

First up it's crackers, then teacakes \u2013 marshmallowy Tunnock's-style ones, rather than those hot-cross buns without the cross. Brendan is eerily calm as always: \"He's just a machine, look at him,\" mutters John trying to catch a glimpse of his circuit board. Tempering chocolate in a clammy tent, building Buckingham Palace out of gingerbread, there is nothing these bravehearts won't try to win that title. Nutmeggy joy. <em>Julia Raeside</em></p> <h2>The Paradise<br>9pm, BBC1</h2> <p>Continuing the adaptation of Zola's novel now set in \"England's first department store\", and the staff are still trying to win the admiration of their Wonka-like employer John Moray. A tougher sale is the show's odd tone of period social realism and unmoored fantasy. This week Sam reveals that behind his sales floor patter lurks a ladies' man, while Denise tries to generate publicity for the store with a competition to find a radiant lady to wear one of the shop's promotional flowers: \"Miss Paradise Pinks\". No one would blame you if you kept the receipt. <em>John Robinson</em></p> <h2>Ian Hislop's Stiff Upper Lip \u2013 An Emotional History Of Britain<br>9pm, BBC2</h2> <p>Over three episodes Hislop explores Britain's national character, beginning with how we became known for having a \"stiff upper lip\". Once upon a time, the English (the focus here) were actually known for their displays of emotion \u2013 during the 18th century a cult of sensibility made expressive feeling fashionable for men and women. However, there was also the restraining attitude of politeness, which was to pave the way for a more stoic outlook. As usual, Hislop tells his story in a jaunty style, using lively and \u2013 at times \u2013 unlikely anecdotes. <em>Martin Skegg</em></p> <h2>Cuckoo<br>10pm, BBC3</h2> <p>Ken (gigantic stand-up Greg Davies) holds a meeting to set out a few ground rules now that Cuckoo (SNL alumnus Andy Samberg), his new surprise son-in-law, has nestled himself into the family home. Meanwhile, the family gets set for a \"welcome home\" party for daughter Rachel, where she plans to unveil her tool of a new husband to her friends. Happily, this second episode suggests that there's more legs to this sitcom than merely the mockery of insufferable new age chump-wits, with Davies doing the beleaguered partriarch bit some justice. <em>Ben Arnold</em></p> <h2>Lillyhammer<br>10pm, BBC4</h2> <p>When this show aired in Norway it was watched by 1/5 of the entire population. It's not going to get such a huge viewership over here, but it's worth noting that it wasn't just Norwegian national pride at play \u2013 this really is something funny and unique. Giovanni is still sticking out like the sorest thumb imaginable: apart from his continual habit of speaking heavily Brooklyn-accented English while all around him speak Norwegian, his attempts at not making any waves have resulted in him getting girlfriend Sigrid pregnant. The Scandinavian medical system proves a foe no wiseguy is prepared to tackle. <em>Phelim O'Neill</em></p> <h2>House Of Lies<br>10pm, Sky Atlantic</h2> <p>Based on Martin Kihn's bestseller, House Of Lies is a smart Don Cheadle-starring US comedy drama with hints of Hustle about it. Part-expos\u00e9 of the dark arts of consultancy, part-Robin Hood vengeance fantasy, it sees Cheadle and his firm of besuited gunslingers concoct scams designed to fleece the 1% whose chicanery plunged America into economic ruin, beginning with fictional megabank Metro Capital. Lots of meta, fourth wall-breaching addresses to camera from Cheadle, if only to explain some of the consultancy terminology. <em>David Stubbs</em></p> <p></p> <h2>Wednesday</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397246061\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/28/1348831613283/Mrs-Biggs-010.jpg\" alt=\"Mrs Biggs\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sheridan Smith stars in Mrs Biggs, ITV1.

That's a lot of people. In this new three-part series, we see how the locals are using all their ingenuity \"to carve out a home, and build their future\", whether by turning their dwellings into a pub (while avoiding eviction by the local council), or by literally transforming dirt into gold: in an eye-popping sequence, a pair of would-be alchemists turn street sweepings into bling, with the addition of nitric acid and mercury. <em>Ali Catterall</em></p> <h2>Mrs Biggs<br>9pm, ITV1</h2> <p>Sheridan Smith's charming portrayal of Mrs Ronnie Biggs concludes with Charmian adapting to life as a single mother in Melbourne. But when a family tragedy strikes, she has a rethink about what she's doing with her life. While she and the boys are pining for Ronnie, he's working as a roofer and living the high life in Rio. And when he finds out that one of his Brazilian lovers is pregnant, he realises he may have the right to remain in the country legally. Ronnie becomes nothing short of punchable when long-suffering Charmian flies in for a visit. <em>Hannah Verdier</em></p> <h2>Best Possible Taste: The Kenny Everett Story<br>9pm, BBC4</h2> <p>One of the most divisive figures in a truly polarising decade for comedy, Kenny Everett was nevertheless an 80s superstar, his shrill-voiced, button-pushing schtick proving a hit with viewers. He was also, as the cliche goes with comics, a \"complex character\", and thus worthy of the warts-and-all treatment meted out to the likes of Kenneth Williams. Here Oliver Lansley (Whites) is tasked with channelling Everett's lively spirit, in a bio-drama that shines a light on his closeted homosexuality and battles with the moral decency brigade. <em>Gwilym Mumford</em></p> <h2>Body Of Proof<br>9pm, 5USA</h2> <p>Dr Megan Hunt (Dana Delany) is Quincy in killer heels. A former neurosurgeon married to the job, she lost her licence after a car crash numbed her fingers and she killed someone on the operating table. Now she's a fast-talking Philly medical examiner, a genius who doesn't do things by the book, desperate to get back into her estranged daughter's life. Watching Body Of Proof is the TV equivalent of cooking in mittens, all fat-fingered exposition and fumbled cliches. So, not entirely surprisingly, it's also pretty watchable. <em>Ben Arnold</em></p> <h2>Perception<br>9pm, Watch</h2> <p>You have to feel sorry for the few crimefighters in US dramas that don't have help from uniquely-skilled eccentric masterminds. Luckily for FBI agent Kate Moretti (Rachael Leigh Cook) she has the option of calling on paranoid schizophrenic professor of neuroscience Dr Daniel Pierce (Eric McCormack). In this debut, Moretti and Pierce investigate the death of a pharmaceutical executive \u2013 along with the hallucinations Pierce's subconscious tends to conjure up. It remains to be seen whether the concept remains fresh, but for now file under \"entertaining romp\". <em>Mark Jones</em></p> <p></p> <h2>Thursday</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397246062\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/28/1348831922974/Wartime-Farm-010.jpg\" alt=\"Wartime Farm\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">'Lumber Jills' Jo Mason and Tracy Anderson in Wartime Farm, BBC2 Photograph: Laura Rawlinson/Lion Television/BBC/Laura Rawlinson</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Laura Rawlinson/Lion Television/BBC/Laura Rawlinson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Wartime Farm<br>8pm, BBC2</h2> <p>It's 1942 and things are tougher than ever for Britain's farmers. Three years of the German blockade have taken their toll and there are shortages of wood, animal feed and fuel. Every scrap of land is turned over to food production \u2013 including parks in London \u2013 while \"Lumber Jills\" are deployed by the Women's Timber Corps to fell trees and \"Bevin Boys\" are sent to coal mines instead of the front. On the farm, Peter converts an ambulance to run on coal gas, while Ruth sets up a food centre for those bombed out of their homes. <em>Martin Skegg</em></p> <h2>Hunted<br>9pm, BBC1</h2> <p>Created by X-Files pensmith Frank Spotnitz and produced by the team behind Spooks, big things are expected from Hunted. Luckily, this opening episode doesn't disappoint, hitting the ground running with assassins, hostages and shootouts from the off. Taking place in the world of industrial espionage, Sam Hunter (Melissa George) finds herself back in active service after a botched mission, while trying to uncover just who betrayed her. While we might not see as action-packed a sequence as the opening scene every week, it's safe to say Hunted is far more than just Bourne on a BBC budget. <em>Mark Jones</em></p> <h2>Homefront<br>9pm, ITV1</h2> <p>This drama series about the wives left behind as their menfolk serve in Afghanistan continues to show promise, without as yet exploring the politics of the conflict - though aspects are bubbling underneath. This week, Louise is incensed when she receives a photo of her hubby, back on leave, in a clinch with a female squaddie, which he insists has been photoshopped. Meanwhile, Paula and Tasha, mother and wife of the slain Matt, continue to lock horns. <em>David Stubbs</em></p> <h2>First Presidential Debate<br>9pm, PBS</h2> <p>Though President Obama may have the edge in recent polls, the 2012 election is still proving tight. Republican candidate Mitt Romney has led a weak campaign, littered with gaffes. Obama will hope to exploit those flaws and no doubt be keen to claim the 47% of Americans that Romney has apparently disowned, but he has to contend with poor job numbers and a struggling economy. The first of three debates took place last night, and is reshown in full here. It focuses on domestic policy, and is held in the swing state of Colorado. <em>Martin Skegg</em></p> <h2>The Judy Garland Show<br>9pm, Sky Arts 2</h2> <p>Repeat showings of the screen legend's 1960s variety series co-hosted by comedian Jerry Van Dyke and including an appearance from her then-ingenue daughter Liza Minnelli. Like most US shows of that era, everyone is overly polite and awkward but it's enjoyable for the nostalgia-paddling in the company of legendary performers like Tony Bennett, Ethel Merman and Peggy Lee. And poignant too to see a fortysomething Garland on the downward slope. Tonight she welcomes former co-star Mickey Rooney and they duet up a storm. <em>Julia Raeside</em></p> <h2>Red Dwarf<br>9.40pm, Dave</h2> <p>Following the 2009 Back To Earth specials, Rimmer, Lister, Cat and Kryten return for a six-part series of new adventures. If that smacks of trying to reinvigorate a franchise best left back in the 20th century, the first, largely moose-gag powered scenes here may give further cause for concern, being just not funny. Gradually, though, things improve as the boys explore an abandoned ship and comic timing reasserts itself. Patchy, but the idea of Rimmer crashing on account of \"self-created malware\" powered by his own resentments suggests that some of the old magic may still be there. <em>Jonathan Wright</em></p> <p></p> <h2>Friday</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-397246063\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/28/1348832140212/Strictly-Come-Dancing-010.jpg\" alt=\"Strictly Come Dancing\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Strictly Come Dancing, Friday night, BBC1, 9pm.

Once more, Tess and Methuselah will be presiding over the cha-cha-cha, as Len, Bruno, Craig, and a new face - the one and only Darcey Bussell - offer \"constructive\" criticism during the first of this weekend's two live shows. Would-be hoofers include Victoria Pendleton, Jerry Hall, Johnny Ball and Sid Owen. There's no elimination this week, so they can all rest easy. For now. <em>Ali Catterall</em></p> <h2>Servants: The True Story Of Life Below the Stairs<br>9pm, BBC2</h2> <p>\"You can't get the help these days\" is a phrase which well described the state of domestic service in Edwardian England, where increasing industrial opportunities for the working classes resulted in numbers of those working in service dropping by around 5,000 a year. In the second part of Dr Pamela Cox's exploration of service, she finds that things downstairs were changing. It was the poorest in society who were drafted in to make up numbers, pulled out of the workhouses, taught household skills, and then whisked off into servitude for middle- and upper-class families. <em>Ben Arnold</em></p> <h2>QI<br>10pm, BBC2</h2> <p>If there's a winning quality to QI, it's that you can never quite tell who's going to be any good at its blend of wit, recondite knowledge and public house esoterica. It was wonderful, for example, to watch Bill Bailey triumph and Jimmy Carr tank utterly a couple of weeks ago. At times it can seem like a bit of a boys' club, it's true \u2013 but tonight comic Sarah Millican continues to hone her mainstream chops, while other contestants include Mr Victoria Coren, David Mitchell, and the former 80s pop star turned broadcasting vicar Rev Richard Coles. <em>John Robinson</em></p> <h2>Leeds International Piano Competition 2012: Finalists Story<br>7.30pm, BBC4</h2> <p>This year's contest has been run and won by 24-year-old Italian Federico Colli. This is another chance to hear one of the finalists he defeated, 26-year-old Australian Jayson Gillham. Gillham \u2013 who has won several other prizes, including 2011's Brant International Piano Competition and this year's Royal Overseas League Music Competition \u2013 performs Beethoven's Piano Concerto No 5 in E-flat major. Also included: a brief history of the grand piano. Suzy Klein presents. <em>Andrew Mueller</em></p> <h2>Modern Family<br>8pm, Sky1</h2> <p>First in the fourth season of the madly popular US sitcom. Jay's hoping his birthday will pass without mention but his nightmarish family have other ideas. Ideas to do with fishing, and boats, and potential drowning. And will Gloria choose this happy day to drop her pregnancy bomb on the birthday boy? Meanwhile, Mitchell and Cameron struggle for emotional buoyancy after a failed adoption bid and decide to get a cat. Pity the cat. <em>Julia Raeside</em></p> <h2>Moone Boy<br>9.30pm, Sky1</h2> <p>It's confirmation time for Martin Moone, and he has something of an epiphany during the service: he wants to be one of those cool altar boys. Once he's accepted into the gang, he discovers there's nothing sweet and innocent about his priest-terrorising new friends. Martin soon gets to the top of his profession and gets to serve on Holy Thursday, so starts a strict training regime to make sure he's the best altar boy ever. But when his sister Fidelma joins the choir his parents can't help but wonder what they did wrong to make <br>half their children devout church-goers. <em>Hannah Verdier</em></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 5 October 2012, because the preview of the BBC4 programme Leeds International Piano Competition 2012: Finalists Story originally said defeated finalist Jayson Gillham \"performs Beethoven's fifth symphony, the opening bars of which are pretty much the classical world's equivalent of Smoke On The Water\". It was Beethoven's Piano Concerto No 5 in E-flat major that Gillham performed.</p>",
  "<p>In the hallway of Bidzina Ivanishvili's extraordinary glass home is a work by Gilbert &amp; George. It is to Ivanishvili's credit that he agrees to be photographed next to it and a slogan that reads: \"SAY FUCK OFF TO RICH BASTARDS.\" Ivanishvili is, after all, worth $6.4bn (\u00a33.9bn), and one of the richest bastards, or successful businessmen, on the planet.</p> <p>His possessions include a zoo with penguins, lemurs and a zebra, kept at his village in western Georgia, and a large collection of modern art. There are sculptures by Henry Moore (the art works dotted around his residence are all fake, the originals \"kept safe\" in a London vault). His home is a striking one-off \u2013 a James Bond-like space-age palace of steel and tubular columns, with panoramic views of Georgia's twinkling capital Tbilisi. Aides nickname it the 'glassle'. There is also fleet of black Land Cruisers.</p> <p>The one thing that Ivanishvili doesn't have is power. Or at least not yet. In October 2011 the Georgian billionaire dramatically and unexpectedly entered politics, challenging the country's president Mikheil Saakashvili in a battle that has become increasingly nasty and personal. Ivanishvili charges that Saakashvili - who swept to power in 2003 during the rose revolution - has morphed into a dictator. On Monday, Georgians vote in a epochal parliamentary election. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/30/georgia-election-bidzina-ivanishvili-mikheil-saakashvili\">The choice is between Saakashvili's ruling party and Ivanishvili's anti-government Georgia Dream</a> coalition.</p> <p>As Ivanishvili tells it, it was Saakashvili's despotic behaviour that forced him into politics. \"I'm 56 years old. I decided to go into politics because of our Soviet-style government,\" he says. The tycoon says that in 2008 Saakashvili \"bought\" off Georgia's old parliamentary opposition, forcing him to forge a new alliance last year with the country's surviving independent political forces.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396940915\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/10/1/1349064710650/Bidzina-Ivanishvili--006.jpg\" alt=\"Bidzina Ivanishvili \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Georgian billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili smiles during his interview in Tbilisi Photograph: VANO SHLAMOV/AFP</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: VANO SHLAMOV/AFP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In an interview on Sunday evening with several international newspapers including the Guardian, Ivanishvili complains bitterly of the persecution he has endured ever since. The state has stripped him of his Georgian citizenship. Several of his activists have been arrested. He even hints that Saakashvili is personally capable of dark deeds. \"I'm very happy that I'm physically alive. We could have experienced pretty much everything from this government,\" he says, flanked by members of his opposition team.</p> <p>Despite his loathing for Georgia's president, however, Ivanishvili's policies seem rather similar. On foreign policy, he says this: \"Our policy is European and Euro-atlantic integration. There is no substitute for Nato.\" The pro-western Saakshvili's believes the same: it was his desire to join Nato that contributed to the Kremlin's crushing invasion of Georgia in 2008, following the president's doomed attempt to wrest back breakaway South Ossetia.</p> <p>Ivanishvili has previously stated that Vladimir Putin's Russia is now freer than Saakashvili's Georgia. Asked about this, Ivanishvili gets irritated; his response surprisingly thin-skinned. The government has painted Ivanishvili as a Russian agent and the accusation clearly grates. He made his fortune in Russia in the 1990s (banking, pharmacy, real estate) but says he has now sold off two-thirds of his Russian assets; he still has a significant chunk of Gazprom. \"You journalists are always asking about Russia,\" he says.</p> <p>But how might he improve relations with the prickly Putin, the man who promised to hang Georgia's current president \"by the balls\"? \"I think it's important to reinstate cultural and commercial relations,\" he says. And what about Abkhazia and South Ossetia, the two rebel regions occupied by Russian tanks, and recognised by Moscow as \"independent\" following the 2008 war? \"When it comes to reinstating territorial integrity this will be a very hard and long task. I don't have illusions it will happen easily,\" he admits.</p> <p>In the run-up to the election, Transparency International has accused both sides of presenting \"simplistic programmes\", promising large investments in agriculture, education, healthcare and social benefits. Critics say Ivanishvili's plan is vague, incoherent even. The billionaire says he main priority is jobs; certainly ordinary Georgian voters complain of high unemployment, low pensions and a lack of opportunities. He points out that unlike Saakashvili he understands business.</p> <p>Western diplomats in Tbilisi fear that if Ivanishvili's coalition loses his supporters will take to the streets, with weeks of turmoil to follow. Ivanishvili, however, says his movement is peaceful. If international observers - currently packing out Tbilisi's al fresco restaurants - certify the election as free and fair he will accept the result; his coalition will form the parliamentary opposition. \"Without doubt,\" he emphasises in English. He's more comfortable, though speaking in Georgian or Russian.</p> <p>Interview over, we troop out past the Gilbert &amp; George fake, and admire the stunning view from his terrace as the sun sets over a picture postcard Tbilisi. Ivanishvili points to the giant sphere hovering as if in mid-air inside his palace. \"It's actually a cafe. You can fit 150 people inside,\" he says. Behind his residence is Tbilisi's wild botanical garden; Ivanishvili's private quarters resemble an inverted flying saucer about to take off. The billionaire says he's been to London twice but hasn't met Tony Blair or David Cameron.</p> <p>And what about his zoo? Saakashvili's aides say the penguins are evidence of his eccentricity. Actually, it appears he is genuinely fond of his animals. \"I bought my penguins from a zoo in France. I've got four of them,\" he says. He admits Georgia's warm climate is not really \"sustainable\" for his pet zebra and says he likes his lemurs. \"They're like cats really. But I haven't got a big zoo.\" As well as his bid to defeat Georgia's president, Ivanishvili has another problem: too many deer. His small herd keeps on breeding, he says. \"Would you like to take a deer home?\" he asks with a smile.</p>",
  "<p>Voters in Georgia go to the polls on Monday in the most bitter and closely fought election since the pro-western rose revolution swept president Mikheil Saakashvili to power in 2004.</p> <p>For the first time, Saakashvili's ruling United Movement party faces a serious challenge from an opposition coalition headed by the flamboyant Georgian billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili. Both sides claim that independent polls put their parties in front.</p> <p>The parliamentary election follows an acrimonious campaign in which there have been allegations the government has intimidated and arrested opposition activists. Ivanishvili accuses Saakashvili of turning Georgia into an authoritarian state and on Sunday said Georgia's human rights record was worse than Russia's.</p> <p>The government has hit back. Officials say the billionaire, who made his fortune in Russia in the 1990s, is a Kremlin stooge attempting to use his vast resources to buy the election. They also say some members of his six-party Georgian Dream coalition are nationalists and Stalinists \u2013 a claims Ivanishvili rejects.</p> <p>Georgia is deeply divided. Most residents in the capital, Tbilisi \u2013 where an estimated 100,000 Ivanishvili supporters rallied on Saturday \u2013 support the opposition. But Saakashvili enjoys an electoral advantage in rural areas, and among the country's ethnic Armenian and Azeri minorities.</p> <p>Western diplomats fear a disputed election result could lead to weeks of turmoil and street protests. Some opposition supporters admit they will take action if the Georgian Dream coalition fails to win.</p> <p>\"There will be a revolution. We will take to the streets. We'll fight with our fists,\" Georgi Gogoladze, an unemployed university graduate in tourism, said on Saturday.</p> <p>Tamar Chugoshvili, chair of Georgia's young lawyers' association, said discontent with the government was widespread. She said Saakashvili had at first developed the country's economy, and promoted democratic values. </p> <p>In recent years, however, he had failed both as a democrat and a reformer, she suggested: \"At the beginning he did some positive things. But where he really failed was in building institutions, including democratic institutions.\" She added: \"He didn't build parliament as a parliament or a judiciary as a judiciary. Instead, power is concentrated in Georgia in the hands of three or four people who make all the decisions.\"</p> <p>Chugoshvili said the election campaign had been a battle not between rival political parties, but between the opposition and the state. The playing field had been \"uneven\" she suggested, with the media and party financing rules titled in the government's advantage. \"The judiciary has acted in favour of the ruling party only,\" she said.</p>"
