[
  "<p>Next week's Republican convention in Tampa has, of course, been choreographed down to the tiniest detail. The stage set, we're told, has been meticulously engineered to convey <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/20/us/politics/romney-campaign-works-feverishly-to-project-relaxed-image.html\">\"warmth, approachability and openness\"</a>. Much thought has been given to avoiding last-minute <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/22/republican-convention-ron-paul_n_1822985.html\">disruptions by supporters of Ron Paul</a>, or by anarchists wielding <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/08/22/feds-warn-anarchists-could-blockade-roads-use-acid-filled-eggs-to-protest/\">acid-filled eggs</a>. Nor are we likely to see the high drama of the 2008 party conventions, marked as they were by historical firsts, most notably the first nomination of a vice-presidential candidate based on under three minutes' vetting by her party.</p> <p>But things might still go wrong. The following list of worst-case scenarios \u2013 and I'd like to be absolutely clear about this \u2013 is provided solely in a spirit of generosity, to help the GOP forestall them. No anticipatory Schadenfreude is intended. None whatsoever.</p> <p><strong>1. The hurricane scenario:</strong> will Hurricane Isaac, most recently reported as a tropical storm <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390444270404577605643222916070.html?mod=WSJ_hpp_MIDDLENexttoWhatsNewsTop\">gathering strength in the Caribbean</a>, wreak havoc in Tampa? (As you may recall, Hurricane Gustav \u2013 though it came nowhere near the convention HQ in St Paul \u2013 gave John McCain another chance to engage in his favourite campaign tactic of \"suspending the campaign\".) Hurricanes, <a href=\"http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/The-Vote/2011/0829/Irene-was-act-of-God.-What-quip-says-about-Michele-Bachmann-campaign\">Michele Bachmann</a> and <a href=\"http://mediamatters.org/research/2005/09/13/religious-conservatives-claim-katrina-was-gods/133804\">Pat Robertson</a> agree, are generally signs of heavenly anger at profligate government spending, or feminists. So what will it mean if God smites Tampa? Perhaps it will mean that He is sick of being used as an explanation for naturally occurring meteorological phenomena. </p> <p><strong>2. The sex scandal scenario:</strong> Tampa's strip clubs are expecting an income boost from the convention, though at least one establishment is <a href=\"http://influencealley.nationaljournal.com/2012/08/hey-republicans-tampas-strip-c.php\">now offering the opportunity to participate online</a>, regrettably reducing the chances of big names being photographed emerging from darkened doorways. Still, after a tiring evening on the convention floor, and a few drinks at the hotel bar, inhibitions crumble. Will this be the moment at which Paul Ryan is finally exposed as harbouring a super-secret sexual fetish that involves dressing up in correctly fitting clothes?</p> <p><strong>3. The fugitive wildlife scenario:</strong> to hold your convention in Florida is effectively to guarantee that it'll intersect with some kind of animals-on-the-loose story: it's a fact, although not a statistically accurate one, that 50% of all Florida news stories involve alligators, and \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/26/magazine/tampa-monkey.html?pagewanted=all\">as detailed in this week's New York Times magazine</a> \u2013 a wily macaque has been on the run from Tampa cops since 2009, achieving heroic outlaw status among locals. The worst-case scenario here involves a monkey or alligator on the loose in the convention centre itself, which among other things might startle the stable of dressage horses with which Mitt Romney travels at all times (strapped to the roof of his car).</p> <p><strong>4. The \"major party figure goes off-message\" scenario:</strong> for days, <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-3460_162-57496040/giuliani-biden-chains-remark-a-blatant-appeal-to-racism/\">Republican talking heads have been insisting</a> that Joe Biden's use of the word \"chains\" was a racially divisive reference to slavery. Imagine, then, if a high-profile Republican, say Sarah Palin, were to accuse President Obama of putting people in \"chains\", or \"shackl[ing]\" them! That would be extraordinarily embarrassing. The party would never let that happen! <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/08/22/1122958/-Mitt-Romney-retroactively-calls-Sarah-Palin-a-racist\">Oh, wait.</a></p> <p><strong>5. The \"rock musician objects to the use of his or her music\" scenario:</strong> another Republican classic, borne of the truth that most rock musicians are left-leaning, while many rightwing politicians are convinced that the way to appeal to a wider audience is to be seen to Rock Out. We've already heard <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/tom-morello-paul-ryan-is-the-embodiment-of-the-machine-our-music-rages-against-20120816\">Rage Against the Machine's rage at Ryan</a> (a little ungrateful, since he has presumably bought several of their t-shirts in XXL). Rumours that Chris Christie plans to arrive on stage to the music of Billy Bragg remain unconfirmed.</p> <p><strong>6. The \"Democratic counter-programming actually works\" scenario:</strong> each party always holds a few half-hearted press conferences near their rival's convention, in an effort to grab a bit of the TV coverage. (Rudy Giuliani spent much of the 2008 Democratic convention <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/27/AR2008082704030.html\">loitering in Denver</a>, muttering about 9/11.) It rarely works. But this time, the Democrats are sending Joe Biden, the Gaffemeister-general \u2013 who just this week <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/dorsey/joe-biden-has-known-three-presidents-intimately\">implied he'd had sex with three presidents</a> \u2013 so anything could happen. Ironically, a big reason Biden's gaffiness is back in the news is the GOP's own strategy of trying to turn it into a liability for Obama. A big enough Biden gaffe \u2013 on the scale of <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1895156_1894977_1841630,00.html\">asking a man in a wheelchair to \"stand up \u2026 let 'em see you!\", say</a> \u2013 could steal precious television time.</p> <p><strong>7. The \"Donald Trump does anything at all\" scenario: </strong> according to several reports, the billionaire self-promoter and hair comedian has been given a \"surprise role\" on the convention's opening day, though Trump himself shyly insists it will be \"rather minor\". (Only kidding! He says it'll be \"<a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/on-the-record/2012/08/08/trump-romney-youve-got-fight-fire-fire-pres-obama\">very, very major</a>\".) Perhaps, in the spirit of the times, he will share his unsolicited musings about sexual assault or reproductive biology? Perhaps he will launch a new toupee. Perhaps he will reveal a previously unknown talent as a human beatbox. Or perhaps he'll deliver a genuine surprise by watching quietly from the audience. One can dream.</p> <p><strong>8. The \"GOP ideology undermined by some basic fact about the convention itself\" scenario:</strong> the theme of the convention's second night will be \"We Built It!\" \u2013 the latest effort to capitalise on Obama's \"you didn't build that\" line. Unfortunately, it will be held in a convention centre built with <a href=\"http://www.thedailydolt.com/2012/08/22/gop-announces-convention-theme-we-built-this-in-stadium-built-with-62-government-funds/\">62% government funding</a>. Cue <a href=\"http://www.supersadtrombone.com/\">sad trombone</a>. </p> <p>And consider bookmarking that <a href=\"http://www.supersadtrombone.com/\">sad trombone link</a>. In the coming days, we may be needing it frequently.</p>",
  "<p>Gawker's dump of 950 pages of documents detailing aspects of Mitt Romney's investments shout out one big truth: that Mitt Romney is not just super-wealthy, but that his wealth is nurtured through a thicket of financial instruments that surpass ordinary expectations of wealth.</p> <p>He also makes money from British shit. But we'll come to that in a minute.</p> <p><a href=\" http://gawker.com/5933641\">The latest Gawker cache</a> is just the tip of an accounting iceberg, since it details investments that may account for only a mere $10m of Romney's estimated $250m in assets, and described just 21 of the hedge funds, vehicles and partnerships that Romney uses. There are doubtless many more.</p> <p>Once again, the spotlight turns back onto Romney's association with Bain Capital, since each of the 21 institutions detailed by Gawker are affiliated with Bain. And once again Mitt Romney's taxes become an issue, since many of these are located in the Cayman Islands, a place associated for good or ill with tax avoidance.</p> <p>Not that anyone is suggesting Mitt Romney has done anything wrong. As the Republican candidate himself repeatedly says: \"I paid the taxes required under the law.\" It's just that the vast majority of Americans don't get the opportunity to invest in Cayman Islands-domiciled funds, whatever the law may say.</p> <p>There's a lot to get through in these documents, and who can say what might be revealed? And yet, as is the style of American journalists, a few US writers have taken to emitting theatrical yawns, most spectacularly a <a href=\"http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2012/08/23/gawkers-worthless-bain-files-2\">reporter for a magazine called Fortune named Dan Primack</a>, who declared: \"There is nothing in there that will inform your opinion of Mitt Romney. How do I know? Because I saw many of the exact same documents months ago, after requesting them from a Bain Capital investor. What I quickly learned [was] that there was little of interest\u2026\"</p> <p>Beauty and news being in the eye of the beholder, we can judge for ourselves, and in fact Primack \u2013 a contender for some sort of \"reverse Pulitzer\" for non-investigative journalism \u2013 is flat wrong. There are at least a few things that may indeed \"inform\" opinions of Mitt Romney.</p> <p>Take, for example, Prospect Harbor Credit Partners, described as \"a $2.8bn Delaware-based fund investing in a wide variety of American, Dutch, English and German firms\", in which Romney had investments of at least $1.25m, or the Bain Capital Europe Fund III, a $287m fund denominated in euros that invested primarily in Europe. Mitt Romney the presidential candidate is fond of berating Europe for its weak economy, and there are a couple of reasons why he might feel so strongly.</p> <p>It's almost as if Romney needs to make a financial disclaimer for every policy position he takes.</p> <p><a href=\"http://gawker.com/5933788\">In the case of Bain Capital Europe Fund III</a>, its entire capital was in two further holding companies, both based in Luxembourg, one named Ideal Standard International Topco and the other named Gemma Europe. The only outcome of note here is a \"management fee\" of \u20ac65m in 2009 paid to Bain Capital's partners. Nothing earth-shattering there, but an example of the twisting, impenetrable (for ordinary mortals) sort of places that Mitt Romney's money ends up, with Cayman Islands-based holding companies owning Luxembourg-based holding companies that pass money between themselves.</p> <p>Well, that's not quite true. You'd never know it from reading the financial statements of Bain Capital Europe Fund III, but Ideal Standard International Topco is the 100% owner of manufacturer Ideal Standards International, which also owns Armitage Shanks \u2013 a familiar name to anyone who has used a toilet in Britain.</p> <p>Yes, that's right: Mitt Romney profits from British shit. But as they say in Britain, where there's muck, there's brass. Ideal Standard passes on its profits from toilet sales to Ideal Standard International Topco, which passes them on to Bain Capital Europe Fund III in Cayman Islands, which sends them on to the investors and Bain Capital partners past and present, such as Mitt Romney.</p> <p>Now all this may indeed merit a big yawn in Wall Street and the City of London, but Mitt Romney isn't applying to lead a hedge fund called US Capital Fund I. He's running to be president of the United States and voters may be more interested in the grubby details than the masters of the universe.</p>",
  "<p>Earlier this year, Killer Mike made quite a splash with his latest album, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R.A.P._Music\" title=\"\">R.A.P. Music</a>. Critics couldn't help but marvel at the unlikely pairing of Mike, with his distinctly southern credentials (and drawl to match), and New York producer EL-P, an underground figure known for his aggressive, frenetic sound. But it was <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPyjJ1MMUzQ\" title=\"\">one track in particular, Reagan</a>, that really raised eyebrows. Although Mike's ostensible target in the song is former Republican President Ronald Reagan (Mike's not a huge fan \u2013 his final line is \"I'm glad Reagan dead\") he also takes some unexpected shots at Barack Obama, at one point characterising him as \"just another talking head telling lies&#xa0;on teleprompters\". Elsewhere, he&#xa0;compares Obama's military policies to Reagan's.</p> <p>We might be surprised to hear this kind of criticism of the man who, just a few years earlier, was declared \"America's first hip-hop president\" because of his deep ties to the genre. Was Killer Mike really attacking the man once dubbed \"B-Rock\" by <a href=\"http://www.vibe.com/\" title=\"\">Vibe magazine</a>? The real surprise, however, is that the track Reagan is not an isolated rebuke but merely the most recent illustration of the deteriorating relationship between Obama and hip-hop. Killer Mike is just one voice in a growing chorus of dissent from within the rap world by artists who believe Obama has failed to take up the pressing issues facing black people in the US.</p> <p>\"Quite obviously, black America is in terrible crisis,\" says Tricia Rose, professor of Africana studies at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. \"The racial and class dimensions of this crisis have simply been largely sidestepped by the Obama presidency and muted by black leadership, which seems largely frozen by the effect of not wanting to undermine the first black president.\"</p> <p>The waning of the Obama/hip-hop love affair appears to be a two-way street, with Obama showing far less interest in the genre than he did in 2008. In fact, the distinction between his two presidential campaigns is stark.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JPyjJ1MMUzQ?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JPyjJ1MMUzQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Rewind to the first election. In the early stages of his campaign, then-senator Obama was making tentative overtures to hip-hop, noting in particular his appreciation of, and interest in, rap music. This was remarkable, in that he was flipping the script on two decades of campaign orthodoxy \u2013 followed by Democrats and Republicans alike \u2013 that hip-hop was politically radioactive. (In fact, the term <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sister_Souljah_moment\" title=\"\">\"Sister Souljah moment\"</a> \u2013 used to describe when politicians distance themselves from extreme elements within their own party \u2013 has its origins in hip-hop: in 1992, Bill Clinton publicly repudiated rapper and activist Sister Souljah for her provocative comments after the Los Angeles riots.)</p> <p>By 2008, seeing the energy his hip-hop affiliations could generate, especially with young voters, Obama was all in \u2013 encouraging artists such as Jay-Z and Sean \"Diddy\" Combs to campaign for him, frequently referencing rap music in his interviews and speeches, and playing rap at his events. In one of the lasting images of the campaign, Obama stood in front of an audience in Raleigh, North Carolina and, invoking <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oz_-VaTHpc8\" title=\"\">Jay-Z's 2003 track Dirt Off Your Shoulder</a>, pretended to brush dirt off his own shoulder. He received standing applause from the crowd and a huge amount of news coverage afterwards. In that one motion, he had transformed the liability of his relative youth into an asset and, in the process, swept away any doubts that hip-hop would remain front and centre for the remainder of his campaign.</p> <p>Rappers were more than happy to play their part, too. As early as 2007, Obama's name started appearing in songs by socially conscious rappers such as Common and Talib Kweli, but it wasn't until the summer of 2008, when he emerged as the Democratic frontrunner, that Obama sparked a mini-industry of&#xa0;songs and mixtapes making direct reference to his candidacy. A long line of performers \u2013 including Nas, Jay-Z, Ludacris, Lil Wayne, Big Boi, Busta Rhymes, Jadakiss, will.i.am, Three 6 Mafia and Young Jeezy \u2013 drew on Obama's rhetoric of hope and change in an effort to mobilise youth and minority voters (and maybe to sell a few albums).</p> <p>It worked. In the 2008 election, youth voter turnout was the highest it&#xa0;had been in 35 years, and it helped propel Obama to the White House. Fittingly, Jay-Z and Diddy had highly coveted seats on the Capitol steps for the inauguration, while <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O9sABRosdNg\" title=\"\">Young Jeezy's My President </a>could be heard playing from street corners across the nation's capital. After that, it was clear that hip-hop could be a potent mobilising force. \"Hip-hop brought awareness to a group of young adults who probably would not have voted otherwise,\" says Jermaine Hall, editor-in-chief of Vibe magazine. \"Some were educated on Obama's political points. Others were just happy to be part of electing a black president into office. Either way the role that Jay-Z, Puff [Diddy] and other hip-hop influencers played in that election can never be denied.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395141809\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/23/1345738070896/Barack-Obama-and-Ludacris-010.jpg\" alt=\"Barack Obama and Ludacris in 2006\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rapper Ludacris with then Senator Obama after a meeting together in Chicago in 2006. Photograph: Charles Rex Arbogast/Associated Press</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Charles Rex Arbogast/Associated Press</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After the election, however, hip-hop receded into the background. In 2009, the Obamas launched the <a href=\"http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/From-the-Studio\" title=\"\">White House Music Series</a>, which has sponsored a&#xa0;variety of musical performances at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. Since its inception, the series has paid tribute to&#xa0;a wide range of genres, including classical, jazz, Motown and country, but rap, the music so instrumental to Obama's success, still hasn't been formally recognised. In fairness, the president isn't entirely to blame for this. In May of 2011, the Obamas invited <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_(entertainer)\" title=\"\">Common</a> to perform at a White House poetry event, but rightwing pundits \u2013 Sarah Palin and Karl Rove foremost among them \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/05/12/sarah-palin-common-_n_860986.html\" title=\"\">doused the event in controversy</a>, using deviously selective readings of Common's work to argue that Obama had just welcomed an anti-police \"thug\" into his midst. The&#xa0;story spread like wildfire. It didn't matter that Common is widely regarded as one of the most positive, peace-loving figures in rap.</p> <p>The Common debacle is clearly illustrative of the opposition's strategy. \"Republicans have pounced on any and all associations Obama might make with black people in a way that has the potential to turn white centrist and independent voters against him,\" says Rose. Fully aware that these voters may see Obama's rap connections as a liability, Jay-Z noted the need for caution. In a 2009 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2009/aug/29/carter-jaz-z-hip-hop\" title=\"\">interview with the Guardian</a> he said: \"I didn't want the association with rappers and gangsta rappers to hinder anything that [Obama] was doing. I&#xa0;came when I was needed; I didn't make any comments in the press, go too far or put my picture with Obama on MySpace, Twitter, none of that.\"</p> <p>Deciding that potential swing voters are too important to lose in 2012, Obama appears to have capitulated, at least with respect to rap. When <a href=\"http://politics.blogs.foxnews.com/2012/02/09/political-playlist-obamas-2012-campaign-rally-music\" title=\"\">his campaign released its 29-song playlist</a> in February, there was not a single rap song on it. There was a healthy dose of country, though, including two songs each by Sugarland and Darius Rucker. Several months later, the campaign expanded its list, finally adding a couple of rap songs, one of which was <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amXeJrA-wDc\" title=\"\">K'naan's Wavin' Flag</a>. This addition was probably less of a tribute to rap, however, than a dig at Mitt Romney. Earlier this year, the Republican challenger used Wavin' Flag in his own campaign, but was forced to stop after K'naan objected (and then invited Obama to use it instead).</p> <p>Keeping a safe distance from rap may be a wise strategic move, but putting politics before principle runs counter to the slogan of \"change\" that Obama ran on, and it has opened him up to some scathing attacks. In his February 2011 song <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22l1sf5JZD0\" title=\"\">Words I Never Said,&#xa0;Lupe Fiasco raps</a>: \"Gaza Strip was&#xa0;getting bombed/ Obama didn't say shit/ That's why I ain't vote for him.\" A&#xa0;few months later, the musician intensified his <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/08/lupe-fiasco-obama-terrorist_n_873353.html\" title=\"\">criticism in a video interview with CBS</a>: \"To me, the biggest terrorist is Obama in the United States of America.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395141810\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/23/1345738194336/Lupe-Fiasco-2011-010.jpg\" alt=\"Lupe Fiasco, 2011\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lupe Fiasco has described Obama as 'the biggest terrorist'. Photograph: Matt Sayles/AP</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Sayles/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lupe wasn't alone. In October of last year, British rapper Lowkey released <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB-vYuYhdSE\" title=\"\">Obama Nation (Part II)</a>, on which M1 of Dead Prez calls Obama \"a master of disguise, expert at telling lies\". Using less incendiary rhetoric, the Seattle-based Blue Scholars nevertheless <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbssPOsHwNs\" title=\"\">open their song Hussein</a> (Obama's middle name) with \"This ain't the hope or the change you imagined\", going on to suggest that Obama has failed to address the US's economic inequality.</p> <p>Obama is hardly the first political leader to reach power and face a backlash from artists who once supported him, but in the absence of the pro-Obama anthems we heard in 2008 or the deep-throated support of legions of performers, the voices of dissent have become especially pronounced. It doesn't help that some of Obama's major fans have changed their tune. Speech, of Arrested Development, who supported Obama in 2008, <a href=\"http://blogs.miaminewtimes.com/crossfade/2012/02/arrested_development_rapper_speech_obama_ron_paul.php\" title=\"\">said earlier this year he was \"disillusioned\" with the president</a> and would support the Republican Ron Paul instead. Snoop Dogg, another Obama fan in 2008, also seemed to throw some of his support behind Paul when he posted a picture of the politician to his Facebook page with the caption, \"Smoke weed every day\", a reference to <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/jan/25/florida-primary-candidates-drug-policy\" title=\"\">Paul's marijuana-friendly platform</a>.</p> <p>Even those inauguration VIPs Diddy and Jay-Z have tempered their enthusiasm. In early 2011, Diddy <a href=\"http://www.thesource.com/articles/41376/Diddy-Covers-The-Source\" title=\"\">told hip-hop magazine the Source</a>, \"I love the president like most of us. I just want the president to do better.\" Jay-Z also acknowledged problems with Obama's first term, admitting that some of the criticism directed at the president has been fair. \"Numbers don't lie,\" he said last July, during a preview of Watch the Throne, his collaboration with Kanye West. \"It's fucked up out there. Unemployment is still high.\"</p> <p>When asked if he feels disappointed with Obama, rapper Nas expresses his continued support for the president but also his disillusionment with the political process that put him in office. \"I've been disappointed by politics since the day I was born,\" he says. \"The historic part of him being elected president was got, and everyone was happy about that, and I'm glad I lived to see it. The flipside is, after we get over that, it's back to the politics, and it's something which doesn't have time for people. It's its own animal.\"</p> <p>This campaign season in the US has exposed this very tension \u2013 for rappers and for Obama. For their part, many rap artists are clearly torn between their allegiance to the first black president and their desire to be straight about conditions on the ground. <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3Vu-h4PgOk\" title=\"\">The Wu-Tang Clan's track Never Feel This Pain</a>, released last June, offers a lyrical glimpse of this ambivalence. Referring to Obama, Inspectah Deck says: \"I never doubted him. I'm proud of him.\" However, these lyrics of encouragement are sandwiched between those of frustration. Speaking of his desire for a better life, he says, \"I ain't waitin' for Obama,\" and continues: \"Seein' is believin', my vision is blurred, 'cause I ain't seein' nothin' I&#xa0;heard, really nothin' but words.\" Album reviews have either read this as criticism or endorsement, but it's not that simple.</p> <p>Nor is it for Obama. Facing a struggling economy and a crazy-eyed opposition that has dragged US political discourse to the right, he appears to be striking a&#xa0;centrist tone in order to reach crucial swing voters. This may indeed be the strategy he must follow if he wants a second term, but it's one that situates him firmly within the very political establishment rappers have long held in contempt.</p> <p><em>Erik Nielson is assistant professor of liberal arts at the University of Richmond, USA</em></p>",
  "<p>There's no doubt that Todd Akin's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/20/todd-akin-defiant-leaders-withdraw-support?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">stunningly misguided understanding of female anatomy</a>, as seen in his claim that raped women can't get pregnant, represented yet another instance of the Republican party's estrangement from science. But the GOP's refusal to grapple with facts goes beyond biology: there's some very basic mathematics that they appear ignorant of as well.</p> <p>The polling showing just how unpopular the party's official anti-abortion position (adopted by the platform committee this week and identical to the policy that Akin tried to use junk science to support) is as follows: just 20% of Americans believe abortion should be \"illegal in all circumstances\", compared to 25% who say that it should \"always be legal\" and the vast majority \u2013 52% \u2013 who say that it should be \"legal only under certain circumstances\".</p> <p>You can make the party's official position compatible with the more moderate view of the actual Republican candidates only with a kind of magical thinking. This was well put by the party chairman <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reince_Priebus\" title=\"\">Reince Priebus</a> earlier this week: \"This is the platform of the Republican party. It's not the platform of Mitt Romney.\" Ta da! Pay no attention to the men behind the curtain. Hey, look: there's Ann!</p> <p>Ann Romney and 14 other women will speak at the Republican national convention (where the platform will be officially adopted) \u2013 almost half of the full list of those invited to address the gathering. But those women dress a campaign stage on which actual female elected officials are outnumbered by men about 10 to one, a gender gap that probably doesn't alarm Republican political operatives so much as the equally stark gap that exists in the polls.</p> <p>In at least three swing states \u2013 Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia \u2013 Romney trails Obama by over 20% among women. My own fealty to the scientific method prevents me from drawing a definitive conclusion about the cause and effect connection between those numbers and the fact that the same three states have in the past year seen GOP state representatives push some of the nation's most restrictive legislation regarding access to abortion: Pennsylvania lawmakers would have trumped Virginia's now-notorious \"transvaginal ultrasound\" requirement by forcing women to accept personal copies of the ultrasound. Ohio Republicans tried to criminalize all abortions where a \"fetal heartbeat\" could be heard.</p> <p>But I do believe the disconnect between Romney and female voters parallels the disconnect that motivates Republicans to so zealously interfere with women's reproductive functions: they just don't know women that well. In a party so dominated by men, do GOP officials even get a chance to think about the women in their lives in a way that is more intimate than a voting booth?</p> <p>Civil rights for oppressed minorities have always increased with the integration of those minorities into public (and private) life. Martin Luther King&#xa0;Jr's eloquent speeches brought black Americans' struggles into people's living rooms. The quiet normalcy of gay couples has propelled acceptance of gay marriage. And living and working with women as equals forces men to think of them as more than their parts.</p> <p>Respect for women's reproductive choices, and the fraught circumstances that can surround the decision to get an abortion, doesn't even come from knowing women who have been raped \u2013 it comes from knowing women.</p> <p>Akin unwittingly illuminated that context. Our national conversation about the definition of rape made clear the larger social issues that fade when we focus so narrowly on \"abortion\". When we talk about access to abortion, the subject is really women's rights and lives and not a medical procedure.</p> <p>Someone dealing with the actual decision to terminate a pregnancy isn't ignoring the issue that dominates pro-life legislation \u2013 the moment when life begins \u2013 she is simply unable to ignore the other questions that need to be answered: is she ready for a child? Who is the child's father \u2013 and is he ready? And, yes, how does she feel about the act that brought the child into being?</p> <p>You can square the polls showing growth in the number of Americans who call themselves \"pro-life\" with the still-large majority of Americans who believe that there are some cases when abortion should be legal if you keep in mind that the most important conversations we have about abortion aren't with pollsters. They're with the women thinking about the questions above. What's more, most Americans know that calling yourself \"pro-life\" is not the same as robbing someone else of their choice. Here's another example of how Akin and his compatriots could use a maths lesson. His argument about whether or not women who are raped even need abortions is relevant to policy (rather than to science alone) because Akin (along with vice-presidential nominee Paul Ryan) last year sought via HR3, the <a href=\"http://www.opencongress.org/bill/112-h3/text\" title=\"\">No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act</a>, to ban any federal money going to pay for any abortion, even if the pregnancy was the result of rape or incest.</p> <p>Akin justified the cruelty of that position with junk science, but he might well just have done some economic research to see if such a restriction was warranted. The Hyde amendment already bans most federal funding for abortions and in 2001, the last year for which there is public data, only 81 women received abortions paid for by government funds.</p> <p>This compared to 251 congressmen who voted for HR3. It would probably behove Akin and the bill's other supporters (just about a 10th of which were women) to make individual appeals to those women rather than use the impersonal bludgeon of congressional legislation to force their actions. The question as to whether those individual appeals would be effective is another issue.</p> <p>In fact, one wonders if in sitting down with a rape or incest survivor, these politicians might find themselves the ones whose convictions waiver.</p>",
  "<p>Mitt Romney's offshore financial holdings are coming under new scrutiny following the publication of internal audits and private letters related to his $250m fortune.</p> <p>On Wednesday New York-based website Gawker published <a href=\"http://gawker.com/5936394/the-bain-files-inside-mitt-romneys-tax+dodging-cayman-schemes\">950 pages of documents </a>that paint a complex picture of the Republican presidential candidate's finances. </p> <p>His wealth is held in a convoluted series of holding companies in tax havens including the Cayman Islands and Luxembourg, as well as the US. Romney's investments include stakes in funds invested in high-risk derivatives like the credit default swaps that contributed to the credit crisis, and an investment vehicle that loaned money to the parent firm of the National Enquirer, a racy US tabloid.</p> <p>Romney has been consistently attacked by Democrats for refusing to release more details of his finances, and his offshore accounts have become the subject of attack ads now running across the US. Romney has so far released two years of partial tax returns and furiously denounced Democratic claims that in some years, he paid no tax at all.</p> <p>The documents published by Gawker, some of which have surfaced before, make clear that tax avoidance is a primary aim of some of his investments. Romney and his wife, Ann, are both investors in a Cayman Island-based fund called Bain Capital Fund VIII. There is no suggestion of any illegality.</p> <p>The fund has assets of $3.7bn and according to the documents \"intends to conduct it operations so that it will not be engaged in a United States trade or business and, therefore, will not be subject to United States federal income or withholding tax on its income from United States sources\".</p> <p>A recent investigation by <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/2012/08/investigating-mitt-romney-offshore-accounts\">Vanity Fair magazine</a> concluded that Romney had $30m invested in the Cayman Islands alone. Bain Capital, Romney's former employer, controls at least 138 funds in the Caymans.</p> <p>The Romneys are also investors in Absolute Capital Return Partners, a Delaware-based partnership that uses a technique called equity swapping to avoid tax. Equity swaps allow investors to exchange gains and losses on investments without taking ownership of the asset. The Internal Revenue Service has <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/21/business/21tax.html\">expressed concerns </a>that swaps may have allowed investors to avoid paying billions of dollars on dividends.</p> <p>Mitt Romney's individual retirement account (IRA) held between $1m and $5m in Absolute Return in 2011 and earned between $100,000 and $1m. In 2006, the Ann Romney Trust held between $100,000 and $250,000, and reported earnings of zero, according to the documents.</p> <p>So far Romney has not commented on the documents. But when he issued his tax returns, Romney's campaign team issued a statement defending his record as a \"successful businessman\" who complied with the tax code and \"has not only added value to our economy through his investment and business activity, but he has paid millions in taxes every year to the US government.\"</p> <p>In an interview to be published Sunday, Romney says one of the reasons he has restricted access to his financial records is that he does not want to disclose how much money he and his wife have donated to the Mormon church.</p> <p>\"Our church doesn't publish how much people have given,\" Romney told Parade magazine. \"This is done entirely privately. One of the downsides of releasing one's financial information is that this is now all public, but we had never intended our contributions to be known. It's a very personal thing between ourselves and our commitment to our God and to our church.\"</p>",
  "<p>Todd Akin, the embattled Republican Senate candidate whose remarks on \"legitimate rape\" prompted calls for him to exit the Missouri race, is now 10 points behind his rival, according to a Rasmussen poll released on Thursday.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/elections/election_2012/election_2012_senate_elections/missouri/questions_2012_missouri_senate_august_22_2012\">The poll</a>, which also found 63% of voters now view him unfavourably, is a major blow to the candidate who has haemorrhaged support from his party since his remarks on Sunday. Only last week, he was <a href=\"http://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=ee08561c-b5c6-45c1-b62b-be0abddcfb85\">leading by nine points</a>, according to one poll. </p> <p>Carried out on Wednesday, three days after his comments on abortion and rape, the new poll shows Claire McCaskill, the Democratic incumbent, with 48% and Akin with 38%. The new figures show a big swing from the previous Rasmussen poll in July in which he came out three points ahead.</p> <p>Of those who responded to the poll, 47% said they now have a very unfavourable view of Akin, while 16% said they had a somewhat unfavourable view of him. However, when asked if Akin should drop out of the race, 42% said no and 41% said yes.</p> <p>The Missouri seat is an important one for Republicans, because it was seen as one of the most winnable for them. The Republicans, already in control of the House, are four seats away from taking control of the Senate.</p> <p>In a further setback for Akin, he has raised just $100,000 in an online fundraising drive that he called a message to \"party bosses\" about his commitment to the Missouri Senate race. </p> <p>That is well below the amount he needs to keep his campaign afloat after he lost the funding of major backers, including $5m from the conservative Super Pac Crossroads GPS. The National Republican Senatorial Campaign also pulled funding.</p> <p>Akin posted on Twitter that thousands of donors had come forward to help him surpass the fundraising target he sought to achieve by the end of Wednesday.</p> <p>His jubilant Twitter message that \"voters should pick candidates not party bosses\" came before the latest poll results.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ToddAkin/status/238615979117142016\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Thousands of people stepped up and helped us raise over $100,000!

  "<p>The Pentagon knew nothing about the book by one of its own until it saw the press release. </p> <p>But the Obama administration quickly took notice of the promise, or threat, by a former US special operations soldier who was in the room when Osama Bin Laden was killed to \"set the record straight\" in a first-hand and unvetted account of the mission to get the al-Qaida leader to be published just weeks before the presidential election. </p> <p>The publisher, a subsidiary of Penguin, has said little about the book, No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed Osama Bin Laden, other than that the author is a former member of Navy Seal Team Six who \"was one of the first men through the door on the third floor of the terrorist leader's hideout and was present at his death\". </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395112022\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/23/1345739895734/bin-laden-book-001.jpg\" alt=\"bin laden book\" width=\"220\" height=\"333\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed Osama Bin Laden Photograph: Dutton/AFP/Getty Images</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dutton/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It promises a \"blow-by-blow narrative of the assault\" beginning with the helicopter crash that could have ended the author's life straight \"through to the radio call confirming Bin Laden's death\". Penguin said the account is \"an essential piece of modern history\". </p> <p>But the book will land in the midst of an election in which Republicans, concerned that Bin Laden's death has neutralised attempts to paint Barack Obama as weak on national security, are accusing the president of overstating his role in the raid for political advantage. </p> <p>No Easy Day is to be published under a pen name, Mark Owen. But Fox News said it has established the true identity of the author, naming him and <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/08/23/author-bin-laden-raid-insider-account-idd-could-face-legal-trouble/\">saying he is a 36-year-old from Alaska</a> who also took part in a Seal raid in 2009 that rescued the captain of an American merchant ship seized by Somali pirates. He retired from the military last year. </p> <p>The book has been a closely held secret in the publishing world, and the announcement that it will be released on September 11, the 11th anniversary of the al-Qaida attacks on the US, caught the Pentagon and intelligence services off guard. </p> <p>Tommy Vietor, a national security council spokesman said: \"We learned about this book today from press reports. We haven't reviewed it and don't know what it says.\" </p> <p>The US navy spokesman, rear admiral John Kirby, said that the former Seal had not sought authorisation to write the account. \"The author did not seek Navy support/approval for this book. We have no record of any request from an author associated with that book company,\" he said. </p> <p>The navy warned that the Seal could be open to prosecution if he reveals classified information. While other former Navy Seals have written books about the Bin Laden raid none was involved first hand. The publisher said that the book has been checked by lawyers and found to be \"without risk to national security\". </p> <p>The author has said little about the book's contents other than that it is about the sacrifices made by members of special operations forces and that he hopes it will inspire young men to join the Navy Seals. </p> <p>Whatever its tone, the account is likely to be caught up in attempts by a group of right wing former military and intelligence officers with ties to the Tea Party movement and Republican party to accuse Obama of claiming too much credit for hunting down Bin Laden. The group, the Special Operations OPSEC Education Fund, last week released a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-Xfti7qtT0&amp;;feature=player_embedded\">22-minute video accusing the president of leaking intelligence and military secrets</a> \u2013 including the role of a Pakistani doctor in finding the al-Qaida leader, details of virus attacks on Iran's nuclear programme and Obama's part in deciding a \"kill list\" of targets of drone strikes in Pakistan \u2013 for political gain. </p> <p>Several former Central Intelligence Agency and US military officers appear in the video saying that Obama is wrongly claiming credit for Bin Laden's death although there is no evidence they have any special knowledge of the situation. </p> <p>The chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, General Martin Dempsey, accused the officers of exploiting their uniforms for political ends. </p> <p>\"If someone uses the uniform, whatever uniform, for partisan politics, I am disappointed because I think it does erode that bond of trust we have with the American people,\" he told Fox News. </p> <p>The Obama campaign has dismissed the attacks as reminiscent of the Swift boat campaign to smear the 2004 Democratic presidential candidate, John Kerry. A group, Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, led a well funded and effective attack on Kerry's record of military service on board Swift boats in Vietnam.</p>",
  "<p>Thousands of supporters of libertarian-leaning Texas congressman Ron Paul will descend on Tampa, Florida, this weekend for a series of events ahead of the Republican National Convention which will nominate Mitt Romney as the party's presidential candidate.</p> <p>There will be several days of concerts, speeches and a rally held by Paul himself that will provide a focus point for a movement that only a few months ago aimed to bring at least 500 party delegates to the Tampa convention in a bid to highlight Paul's anti-war, anti-big government beliefs and provide a potentially embarrassing upset to Romney.</p> <p>But that aim, which saw a \"stealth\" strategy exploit arcane party rules to amass delegate support far beyond what Paul had achieved at the ballot box, now looks like a forlorn hope. </p> <p>The Republican Party machine has largely closed ranks behind Romney and in some cases thinned the ranks of state delegations of some Paul supporters.</p> <p>Now, instead of causing a stir inside the Tampa convention hall, the legions of Paul backers will be mostly visible at things like a three-day music and activism event called Paul Festival, whose acronym stands for People Awakening and Uniting for Liberty. </p> <p>Beginning Friday, Paul Festival features dozens of bands and speakers that range from the producer of a new film of an Ayn Rand novel to Gary Johnson, the Libertarian Party's candidate for president. </p> <p>Festival organiser Tracy Diaz said the event would be about energising Ron Paul supporters even as the congressman himself prepares to step down from electoral office and leave politics. \"The aim is to re-energise and celebrate, not only what Ron Paul has achieved, but also what the grassroots has been able to achieve,\" she said.</p> <p>Paul himself will be speaking at a major rally on Sunday at the University of South Florida's Sun Dome arena. The all-day event will feature a roster of speakers touting the causes close to Paul's heart, such as Austrian school economist Walter Block and his own son, Kentucky Senator Rand Paul.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395174381\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/23/1345736611692/ron-paul-supporters-006.jpg\" alt=\"ron paul supporters\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\"Ron Paul sees this as a multi-generational project,\" says a University of Iowa professor. Photograph: Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty Images</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Paul spokesman Jesse Benton said the rally would ensure Paul's beliefs got a high profile airing, despite the fact he was not given a speaking slot at the convention. \"No matter the convention outcome the Congressman and his fellow patriots will be heard,\" Benton said.</p> <p>But that voice is not going to be as loud as it might have been. Paul's delegate strategy saw supporters overtake the nomination process in several states, winning large numbers of delegates in places like Massachusetts, Maine and Louisiana. It also saw fierce disputes with party officials, including scuffles that led to arrests and injuries in Louisiana.</p> <p>However, the number of Paul delegates has since been chipped away with several state delegations packed with Paul supporters being virtually tossed out. Talks between the Romney team and the Paul campaign have now reached compromises in many cases, but at a cost of a reduced Paul presence.</p> <p>Evan Kenney is a Massachusetts Ron Paul supporter who first won his delegate place, then saw it denied by the local state party, and then had it reinstated on Wednesday along with four others, leaving 12 Paul supporters still left out. </p> <p>\"It's really tremendous that we did make a difference, but still extremely disheartening that 12 elected representatives were unjustly removed from their rightful positions,\" he said.</p> <p>Kenney believes the movement gathering in Tampa would still make its point no matter whether they were inside or outside the convention hall and would not be effected by the fact that Paul himself was leaving politics. \"It is the liberty movement. The cause is much bigger than Ron Paul,\" he said.</p> <p>Certainly Paul seems to be already leaving the limelight. He has maintained a low media profile in recent months, including refusing repeated interview requests from the Guardian. His team has also urged his supporters to not upset official proceedings in Tampa. </p> <p>Some experts believe that could be down to ensuring a smooth handover of the reins of the movement to Rand Paul, who did secure a coveted high profile speaking slot at the convention. </p> <p>\"Ron Paul sees this as a multi-generational project. He sees his son as the next stage. You don't want to burn bridges,\" said Professor Cary Covington, a political scientist at the University of Iowa.</p> <p>Ron Paul supporters can lay claim to bringing many of their ideas into the Republican mainstream. Bolstered by the Tea Party, Paul's extreme anti-government stance is now virtually Republican orthodoxy. The House of Representatives also recently passed a law to audit the Federal Reserve: a cause Paul was once derided for but that even Romney now backs. </p> <p>But on the other hand the Republican platform in 2012 offers little in Paulite ideas of bringing American troops home from abroad or issues like legalising drugs or raising taxes to stop deficit spending. </p> <p>Repeated efforts this week by Paul delegates to insert language into the platform reflecting such beliefs were voted down by the far greater numbers of Romney delegates.</p> <p>However, that does not bother all Paul supporters. Diaz said the movement of people who have formed around Paul and been swept up in his repeated, if ill-fated, runs for the presidency were committed to taking over the party from the bottom up. </p> <p>Diaz pointed to recent events in Nevada where Paul supporters won control of numerous key offices giving them virtual control over the state party. \"Look at what happened in Nevada. The movement is not going to roll over and die just because Ron Paul is not the candidate any more,\" she said.</p>",
  "<p>A year ago this week, the Syrian National Council was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/23/syrian-opposition-national-council\" title=\"\">formed in Istanbul</a> by a coalition of political forces and figures that presented themselves as society's representatives. In the absence of a mechanism to determine the power base of each political force, the Muslim Brotherhood came to dominate the council, benefiting from its relations with Islamist-leaning Turkey.</p> <p>The Brotherhood's perceived monopoly over the council has led to a chronic political stalemate within the opposition and will most likely undermine an orderly transition if the situation persists. But <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/16/un-finds-new-syria-mediator\" title=\"\">the appointment of Algerian veteran diplomat Lakhdar Brahimi</a> as the new UN-Arab League envoy to Syria, along with the recent defections of high-level technocrats, presents a new opportunity to reverse the group's domination.</p> <p>Brahimi is unlikely to succeed where his predecessor Kofi Annan failed in terms of ending the violence, but he can secure a political settlement and mediate a representative, inclusive political body that will help to avert chaos in the wake of the regime's downfall.</p> <p>It is difficult to precisely gauge the Brotherhood's power base inside Syria, as the organisation has been banned since 1963. But past experience, when the Brotherhood was part of the country's political system for more than a decade, and well-established social dynamics offer useful insights.</p> <p>Moulhem Droubi, a senior member of the Brotherhood, has said the organisation represents 25% of the Syrian population. That is certainly disputable. In the 1949 parliamentary election, the movement won around 2.5% of the vote and in subsequent elections never rose above 6%.</p> <p>At the time, the Brotherhood was viewed largely as a moderate organisation that preached more about socialism than religion, though it later started to alienate minorities. In 1950, it successfully campaigned to amend the constitution to make Islam the religion of the state and the president.</p> <p>With the ascension of the Ba'ath party and its totalitarian rule in the 60s, the Brotherhood turned violent, splintered and formed militias that would later target civilians and military officers along sectarian lines in the 70s and 80s. Its power base has since dwindled significantly after four decades of systematic cleansing by the Ba'athist regime.</p> <p>Activists from various parts of Syria have told me that, prior to the uprising last year, the country had almost zero Brotherhood presence. The organisation's presence then started to return in some areas, particularly in Homs, Hama and Idlib.</p> <p>Salama Kayla, a Christian Palestinian-Syrian who was recently deported by the regime for his role in the uprising, said he had visited several protest spots, including in Homs and Hama, in the early months of the uprising.</p> <p>He said there were \"negligible groups\" of Brotherhood members with the protests in few areas. He said that activists in Hama complained that a small Brotherhood-affiliated group was pushing for \"violent conflict\". It was surprising, he said, that the Brotherhood had such a small presence in a city widely considered as its stronghold.</p> <p>\"I am a middle-class Halabi [from Aleppo] and everyone I knew hated them,\" one activist told me. \"The only time I ever met an MB member is during an embassy protest outside Syria. They seem to be more popular among exiles.\"</p> <p>A senior member of the SNC who is close to the Brotherhood told me the organisation tends to believe that any person who receives aid through the group is expected to support it electorally in the future.</p> <p>Even if the Brotherhood succeeds in establishing a palpable presence, its influence is likely to be limited to certain areas. At least seven out of 14 provinces will be outside the Brotherhood's sphere of influence for the foreseeable future: Hasaka, Raqqa, Deir ez-Zor and Deraa (tribal and Kurdish areas that make up over 30% of the population, loyal to their local leaders), Suweida (the Druze stronghold, nearly 2% of the population) and the coastal provinces of Latakia and Tartus (where Alawites, Ismailis and other minorities are based and make up nearly 8.5% of the population).</p> <p>Demographically, non-Sunnis form 30% of the population and Sunni Kurds make up 9%. These bases of ethnic and religious minorities, plus the tribes \u2013 altogether making up at least 70% of the population \u2013 had been outside the group's influence in the past and will remain so in the future.</p> <p>When the Brotherhood was part of the political system, the business community in both Aleppo and Damascus allied itself with the People's party, a nationalist non-Islamist party, and then to the Ba'ath party. Politically, the business community today is also more likely to ally itself with non-Islamist groups.</p> <p>Also, in both of these significant cities, the business community is socially tied with a local pragmatic clergy that adheres to a classical Sunni religious school similar to that of al-Azhar in Egypt.</p> <p>The Brotherhood realises the limits of its power and seeks to establish levers of influence during the uprising and in the transition period. According to different accounts, the Brotherhood is using its control over the two key offices within the SNC, the aid and military offices, to establish leverage in certain areas and among the Free Syrian Army.</p> <p>The group has formed its own brigades under the so-called Body of Civilians Protection, naming some of the brigades after the Brotherhood's historical leaders. According to one informed source, the group has additionally about 13 brigades operating in Hama, known as Abulfidaa brigades.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the country appears set for a war that will continue until the regime falls. Significant segments of society in Syria are torn between a despotic regime that is committing atrocities on a daily basis and a stagnant political opposition that has so far failed to present a viable alternative and is dominated by a group they view suspiciously. That is a torn majority, not a silent majority.</p>",
  "<p>Earlier this year, the Obama administration responded to <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/full/75783990?access_key=key-1l6sr2s7yfm3syq0wxtt\">a lawsuit</a> seeking videos and photographs of the Osama bin Laden raid by claiming (as usual) that it was all too secret to disclose. A federal court (<a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/04/23/federal_judge_complicity/\">as usual</a>) acquiesced to those assertions and <a href=\"http://jurist.org/paperchase/2012/04/federal-judge-denies-foia-request-for-bin-laden-photos.php\">dismissed the suit</a>, finding that \"the release of the images and/or videos 'reasonably could be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security.'\" The administration made the same secrecy and national security claims to <a href=\"http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2011/05/look-whos-foiaing-bin-laden-death-photo/37493/\">deny the requests</a> of multiple news agencies for related materials about the Bin Laden raid.</p> <p>Those materials would have resolved <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2011/08/osama-bin-laden-killing-media\">still lingering and serious questions</a> about that raid \u2013 questions created by the administration's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/may/04/osama-bin-laden-killing-us-story-change\">numerous inconsistencies</a> and <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/al-qaeda/8491108/Osama-bin-Laden-day-two-and-a-new-version-of-how-events-unfolded.html\">false</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elliottjustin/status/66107429305331712\">claims</a>, including whether it was a \"kill-not-capture\" mission from the start and whether Bin Laden resisted capture in any way. Despite the <a href=\"politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2011/05/08/shut-up-and-move-on-kerry-says/\">decree</a> of the always-imperious Democratic Senator John Kerry that everyone wanting answers should just \"shut up and move on\", actual journalists continue to ask the right questions. Shortly after the raid, Mother Jones's Adam Weinstein, an Iraq war veteran, wrote:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Now that Osama bin Laden rests in the briny deep, reporters and citizens alike are asking good questions about the operation that dumped him there. Was it a kill mission? What happened to everyone else in the compound? And what was up with that sea burial, anyway?</p> <p>\"Each of these questions fundamentally involves how Americans ought to act in combat, and as such, they deserve good answers \u2013 which haven't been fully articulated by the White House or the military.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Last August, in the same magazine, Mark Follman wrote a <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2011/08/osama-bin-laden-killing-media\">comprehensive article</a> exploring many of these questions that began with this sentence:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"You don't have to be a conspiracy theorist to be still scratching your head about the end of Osama bin Laden.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Noting that \"there have been multiple divergent accounts of the Navy Seals' mission in Abbottabad, Pakistan, with the story seeming to be colored by politics, sensationalism, and outright fantasy,\" he detailed the multiple \"glaring discrepancies\" in the various leaked stories which, he correctly observes, have \"big implications\".</p> <p>An event of this magnitude deserves clear transparency and disclosure, but the Obama administration's typically reflexive invocation of secrecy claims has prevented it. What makes that so much worse, though, is that at exactly the same time that it was telling a court that the mission is too secret to permit such disclosure, the White House launched a coordinated campaign of selective media leaking that had only one purpose: to glorify the president for political gain. </p> <p>Thus the same administration that resisted judicial disclosure pursuant to transparency laws <a href=\"http://www.theatlanticwire.com/business/2011/08/fact-checking-new-yorkers-fact-checkers/40964/\">leaked bits and pieces</a> about the mission (always favorable to the president) to their <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2113155,00.html\">favorite media message-carriers</a>; secretly <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/05/23/wh_leaks_for_propaganda_film/\">met with and shoveled information</a> to big Hollywood filmmakers planning a pre-election release of a film about the Bin Laden raid (now pushed back until December in the wake of the ensuing controversy, though the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYFhFYoDAo4\">already-released film trailer</a> \u2013 see below \u2013 will soon be inundating the nation); and then sat down with <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/05/03/nbc_news_top_hagiographer/\">one of America's most obsequious, military-revering news anchors</a> for an hour-long prime-time special that spoke of the raid with predictable awe but asked none of the hard questions about these lingering issues.</p> <p>This is all just part-and-parcel of the administration's <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/blog/national-security/calling-out-cia-its-secrecy-game-targeted-killing\">modus operandi when it comes to classified information</a>. The same administration that has launched an <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/06/obamas-whistleblowers-stuxnet-leaks-drones\">unprecedented persecution campaign</a> against whistleblowers (who disclose information about high-level deceit and wrongdoing) routinely leaks classified information for political gain. Only Bad Leaks (ones that expose government wrongdoing) are punished, while Good Leaks (making Obama look good) are overlooked if not officially sanctioned. Similarly, as the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/jun/06/targeted-killing-campaign-propaganda\">ACLU documented</a> in a Guardian op-ed last June, the same administration that continuously blocks courts from reviewing the legality of their conduct by invoking secrecy claims compulsively leaks classified information to the media about those very same programs in order to depict the president as our \"tough\" and resolute protector.</p> <p>Now <a href=\"http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/22/navy-seals-book-will-describe-raid-that-killed-bin-laden/\">comes news</a> that one of the Navy Seals who participated in the Bin Laden raid will, using a pseudonym, publish a book setting forth his first-person account about what happened. In a stroke of excellent luck for Obama's re-election effort, the book \u2013 entitled No Easy Day: The Firsthand Account of the Mission That Killed Osama bin Laden \u2013 will be released on 11 September: providing the double political whammy of exploiting the emotions of that date and putting Obama's most celebrated national security coup front and center less than two months before the election. <a href=\"http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/22/navy-seals-book-will-describe-raid-that-killed-bin-laden/?gwh=673E2A40FBAA5F6C8E1E769C28226F0A\">As the New York Times observes</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"[T]he book promises to be one of the biggest titles of the year, with the potential to rattle the presidential campaign in the final weeks before the November 6 election \u2026 the publisher is expecting a major bestseller, with a planned print run of 300,000 copies in hardcover.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The description provided by Penguin, the book's publisher, promises a \"blow-by-blow narrative of the assault, beginning with the helicopter crash that could have ended [the author's] life straight through to the radio call confirming Bin Laden's death\". Although Pentagon and White House officials deny any advance knowledge of the book, the Navy Seal author is hardly attempting to conceal his identity. According to the NYT account, he provides ample biographical information that should make the process of identifying him extremely easy, including discussions of \"his childhood in Alaska\", the fact that he \"has completed 13 combat deployments since\" the 9/11 attack, and that he \"retired within the past year\". The book also includes accounts of \"his other previously unreported Seal missions\".</p> <p>Given that many of the details of the Bin Laden raid remain classified, this would appear to be a clear and obvious case of the unauthorized disclosure of classified information. The same is presumably true of any details he provides about \"his other previously unreported Seal missions\". Alternatively, if the raid has now been declassified, then what excuse remains for continuing to conceal the video and photographic evidence in the possession of the CIA that would reflect what actually happened?</p> <p>As the administration continues to persecute numerous actual whistleblowers under espionage statutes (and to <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2011/06/23/risen_3/\">legally harass the journalists</a> who published their leaks), will there be any attempt to criminally investigate the Navy Seal who wrote this very-helpful-to-Obama book? (As a side note, remember when Democrats \u2013 who now coordinate with Hollywood studios to produce pre-election hagiography of the commander-in-chief's kill orders \u2013 used to complain bitterly about how Bush/Rove Republicans would (spoken with purse-lipped disgust) <em>exploit national security for political gain</em>?)</p> <p>Allowing the government to operate behind an impenetrable wall of secrecy is destructive in its own right. But all of that becomes substantially worse when the administration is permitted to play these sorts of games with its secrecy powers: overlooking or rewarding politically beneficial leaks while severely punishing leaks that provide an important public value by exposing high-level corruption. Manipulating presidential secrecy powers in this way is an odious instrument for propaganda: it ensures that all embarrassing or incriminating information remains suppressed, and the only thing the public learns \u2013 and the eager, grateful press amplifies \u2013 are the informational crumbs doled out by the White House in order to glorify the leader. That's the very definition of state propaganda.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EYFhFYoDAo4?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EYFhFYoDAo4\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>",
  "<p>President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney are both being portrayed in an overwhelmingly negative light as they battle each other in America's 2012 presidential election, a new survey of media coverage has revealed.</p> <p>The result has been one of the most negative electoral contests in recent memory in which Obama is widely painted as having failed to kickstart any meaningful economic recovery, but Romney is described as a rich, elitist \"vulture\" capitalist out of touch with the struggles of ordinary Americans.</p> <p>A survey by the Pew Research Center's Project for Excellence in Journalism has found that the \"master narrative\" of Obama is negative in 72% of coverage about his character and record. </p> <p>But while that may worry Democrats nostalgic for 2008's message of hope and change, there is little consolation for Republicans. The study also found that Romney's master narratives were negative in some 71% of coverage of the former Massachusetts governor.</p> <p>PEJ director Tom Rosenstiel said the results were a surprise, especially as external events had so far played little role in either campaign, meaning the negativity was more deliberate than any sort of reaction to an outside crisis. </p> <p>\"It is just nastier than normal,\" said Rosenstiel, pointing out that the 2004 contest \u2013 which was also very negative \u2013 had been marked by dramatic external events like the war in Iraq and the Abu Ghraib prison scandal.</p> <p>The study looked at some 800 stories from 50 major news outlets and examined 1,772 assessments of the candidates. It found that 36% of all assertions about Obama suggested that the president had not done enough to help the economy. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395097996\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/22/1345665806199/barack-obama-pew-006.jpg\" alt=\"barack obama pew\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Obama is widely painted as having failed to kickstart an economic recovery \u2026</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile 14% of assertions about Romney were that he was a vulture capitalist, and 13% were that he was a rich elitist. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395097997\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/22/1345666022384/mitt-romney-pew-006.jpg\" alt=\"mitt romney pew\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2026 while Romney is described as a rich, elitist 'vulture' capitalist out of touch with ordinary Americans</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Gress/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\"The survey shows that the press has delivered voters a remarkably negative story for both Obama and Romney. The negative theme about Obama's record is winning out right now. At the same time so is the argument that Mitt Romney is a callous businessman and a wealthy elitist,\" said PEJ associate director Mark Jurkowitz.</p> <p>Rosenstiel believes the reasons for this are varied. The rise of the internet and each campaign's rapid response teams means narratives of attack and defense are all too dominant in the modern 24 hour news cycle. </p> <p>At the same time newsrooms of traditional media outlets have shrunk in size, meaning that partisan voices, such as surrogates or campaign officials from each side, find it easier to dominate coverage that has to be produced quickly. \"The campaigns understand the weaknesses of the media system,\" Rosenstiel said. </p> <p>But it is not just that the campaigns themselves are being negative. Though both sides have been markedly aggressive in their attacks on each other, their positive messages have often failed to be reported by the press. </p> <p>For example, despite major efforts by the Obama campaign to show him as caring about ordinary Americans, just 3% of press coverage reflected that assertion. </p> <p>The result is a marked difference from the 2008 campaign, when Obama beat Republican Senator John McCain. In that contest only 31% of coverage about Obama reflected a negative narrative, with McCain coming in at 57%</p> <p>In recent elections only the coverage of President George W Bush in 2004 was more negative than either Obama or Romney this year. In that contest some 75% of narratives in the press about Bush were negative, though that did not stop him from winning re-election.</p>",

  "<p>The fate of billions of dollars of promised funding from rich countries to help the developing world adapt to climate change will be discussed on Thursday in Geneva, at the first meeting of the UN's <a href=\"http://unfccc.int/cooperation_and_support/financial_mechanism/green_climate_fund/items/5869.php\" title=\"\">Green Climate Fund</a>.</p> <p>The fund is meant to be the biggest single funding route for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/dec/17/us-copenhagen-100bn-climate-fund\" title=\"\">$100bn (\u00a363bn) that developed countries have pledged</a> should flow to poor nations each year by 2020, to help them cut greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to the effects of global warming.</p> <p>But key decisions \u2013 such as where the fund should be headquartered, who should run it, how it will operate and how it can raise funds \u2013 will be delayed for months.</p> <p>On Thursday morning, the initial meeting, delayed by months as governments procrastinated, began with the election of a developing and a developed country co-chair. These were the South African representative Zaheer Fakir and Australia's Ewen McDonald, who had been favourite to win the post. They will jointly chair the fund for its first year. Fakir is head of international relations and governance at the South African Department of Environmental Affairs, while McDonald is deputy director general of the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID).</p> <p>A final decision on the GCF's location \u2013 Germany, Namibia, and other countries have all offered to be the host \u2013 is understood to be unlikely before the end of the year.</p> <p>All of the other important issues around the GCF, including how much money it is likely to have to disburse and how it will raise funds from the private sector, are matters of contention. The fund is unlikely to have much sway over the initial round of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/dec/07/cancun-summit-climate-aid-row\" title=\"\">\"fast-start\" financing from rich to poor countries</a> that was agreed at the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/copenhagen\" title=\"\">Copenhagen summit in 2009</a>. Most of the $30bn (\u00a319bn) pledged at Copenhagen has now been committed, and most of it is already earmarked for various projects. For instance, the UK is on track to provide \u00a31.5bn between 2010-13 and about \u00a31bn of this has already been committed to bilateral and multilateral projects developed with poor countries, or is being channelled through existing funding routes.</p> <p>Given this, it is unclear whether the GCF will have access to much financing in the next few years, even though it is envisaged to be the world's single biggest source of financing for climate change mitigation and adaptation by 2020.</p> <p>In the longer term, the prospects for substantial funding are even less clear: it will have to raise money from both governments and the private sector but at present there is no agreement on how it might do so.</p> <p>Although <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/dec/21/copenhagen-accord-climate-change\" title=\"\">the $100bn a year was agreed at Copenhagen</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/dec/13/cancun-climate-agreement\" title=\"\">confirmed at Cancun in 2010</a>, the GCF will be only one source among many for those funds. Private sector and government cash flowing through other routes will also count towards the $100bn goal.</p> <p>One major source of contention in the discussions is that some developing country governments want to limit the fund, so that contributions from the public sector come only from \"traditional donors\". That is, the countries labelled as developed in the original UN climate treaties of 1992 and the Kyoto protocol of 1997. This is an important distinction, as it would mean that China, the world's second biggest economy, and other rapidly growing countries such as South Korea, Singapore and many Middle Eastern nations, despite their high incomes per capita, would be excluded from contributing. Developed nations including the US and the UK insist that this distinction should not apply to the fund. Although the GCF has been under discussion for years, with governments agreeing in principle at Copenhagen to set it up, the complexities of the climate negotiations have stalled its development. However, the delays increase the political risk around the project: for instance, the US under a Republican president or Congress is unlikely to be willing to commit substantial sums to the fund.</p> <p>As the US presidential campaign has progressed, the White House has not made climate change negotiations a major issue. The administration's special envoy for climate change, Todd Stern, caused consternation several weeks ago when he appeared to suggest, in <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/e/oes/rls/remarks/2012/196004.htm\" title=\"\">a speech at Dartmouth College in the US</a>, that the long term goal of holding global warming to no more than 2C above pre-industrial levels \u2013 the underpinning principle of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/dec/18/copenhagen-deal\" title=\"\">Copenhagen accord</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/dec/11/mexico-cancun-environment-climate-summit\" title=\"\">Cancun agreement</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/interactive/2011/dec/12/durban-climate-change-conference-2011-global-climate-talks\" title=\"\">last year's agreement at Durban</a> - could be abandoned.</p>",
  "<p>Paul Ryan attempted to draw a line under the Republican party's abortion row by saying on Wednesday he is proud of his anti-abortion record but that Mitt Romney set the policy for the presidential ticket.</p> <p>But despite his latest comments, to reporters aboard his plane to Raleigh, the controversy is unlikely to go away any time soon, according to political strategists.</p> <p>The storm has rumbled on since the weekend, when the Republican congressman Todd Akin caused outrage with his remarks about \"legitimate rape\".</p> <p>Romney then put out a statement reiterating his \u2013 and the Romney-Ryan ticket's \u2013 support for abortion in cases of rape, incest and a threat to the life of the mother.</p> <p>Ryan is anti-abortion and although he supports an exception for when the mother's life is threatened, he has co-sponsored a bill that would allow hospitals to refuse abortion in cases where it could save a woman's life.</p> <p>Anti-abortion groups such as Personhood USA have expressed their concern over Ryan's apparent lack of influence over Romney, who they regard as too liberal on the issue, while Democrats have sought to highlight the vice-presidential candidate's conservative views on social issues.</p> <p>When asked about the differences he and Romney had with regard to abortion, on Wednesday, Ryan said: \"I'm proud of my pro-life record,\" according to the New York Times.</p> <p>Ryan said: \"Mitt Romney's going to be the president. The president sets the policy. His policy is exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother. I'm comfortable with it because it's a good step in the right direction. I'll leave it at that.\"</p> <p>Political strategists said the Democrats would continue to capitalise on the controversy but that it would have little impact on the Republican party internally.</p> <p>Steve Mitchell, a Republican strategist and chairman of Mitchell Research and Communications, said: \"The Democrats are going to want to push this message forward from now until the end of the campaign. The president is trying to find a coalition that will get him to 51% and part of that coalition are women. By taking that incredibly stupid remark Akin made, and trying to attach Ryan to those comments, they can make even greater inroads with women who would find those remarks offensive.\"</p> <p>Mitchell said that while Ryan is currently coming under fire from anti-abortion groups, it won't last. \"He may be criticised by pro-life voters but that will be short-lived. For social conservatives who are single issue voters it's clear that the Ryan position is far superior to [that of] vice-president Biden. George Bush moved his position to be in line with Ronald Reagan on abortion.</p> <p>\"Ryan is going to have to make it clear, as he has, that rape is rape and he disagrees vehemently with Akin \u2013 he asked him to withdraw from the race. The Democrats will have an ad that says that Paul Ryan and Todd Akin sponsored a bill about unavailability of abortion in cases of rape together, to tie Ryan and Akin together.\"</p> <p>He said he believed that it would not have an impact on the Republican party.<br>\"It is not going to be an internal problem in the Republican race at all. The position on abortion will be the Romney position if he is elected. Liberal voters who are single issue voters are already voting for Obama. Other women who are not single issue voters will made their decision on other issues.\"</p> <p>However, Dr Lara Brown, a political strategist who served in Bill Clinton's administration at the Department of Education, disagreed.</p> <p>\"The vice presidential candidate's voting record is in line with the party platform but not in line with the presidential ticket, so of course this is going to roil the factional politics within the party. But I think that the Republican party would be foolish to spend time on this issue. Abortion is not a wedge issue, where a substantial majority is one one side and a campaign used that issue to pull a majority towards them. The country is split on pro-life [vs] pro-choice. It is much more in the middle.\"</p> <p>Brown, an assistant professor in political science at Villanova University in Philadelphia, said that Democrats were keen to exploit the row because of the importance of women voters.</p> <p>A poll from the Pew Research Centre last month showed that while Obama and Romney tied among male voters, the president was ahead among women voters by nearly 20 percentage points. This week's Wall Street Journal/NBC Poll also gave Obama a lead over women.</p> <p>Brown said: \"Democrats see an opportunity to tie what they believe is an extreme position on abortion to the ticket and they are doing this because white women are the swing vote. It will especially matter in places in suburban America where there are white women moderates.\"</p> <p>In a statement, Jennifer Mason, communications director for Personhood USA, said: \"Personhood USA does not endorse political candidates, but we had hoped that Congressman Ryan would be a good influence on Governor Romney, considering Romney's liberal abortion record.\"</p> <p>She said: \"Reading today that babies conceived in rape should suffer the death penalty under a Romney-Ryan administration is extremely concerning, and indicates that congressman Ryan's pro-woman and pro-baby positions would have little influence if he wins the office of vice president of the United States.\"</p>",

I have to admire Archos for trying something diffrrent with the Gen10, which comes with a \"lid\" for the tablet that doubel;s as a keyboard (much like the Microsoft Surface), buyt in practice, I have to say Im not afan.</p> </blockquote> <p> Next!</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240161778/RIM-to-lose-stranglehold-on-government-mobile-market\">RIM set to lose stranglehold on government mobile market &gt;&gt; Computer Weekly</a></h2> <blockquote> <p>A government document seen by Computer Weekly stressed the importance of using appropriate commercial products to enable remote working in government at T1.
