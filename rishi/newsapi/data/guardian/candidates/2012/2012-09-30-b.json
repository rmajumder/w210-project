  "<p>If there is one thing more unpredictable than the behaviour of anti-western leaders , it is the behaviour of the west's self-anointed friends. Mikheil Saakashvili, who swept to power in Georgia nine years ago in the <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/4532539.stm\" title=\"BBC News: How the rose revolution happened\">rose revolution</a>, used to be the darling of Washington and Brussels. Young, aggressive, Atlanticist, intent on securing membership of Nato, Saakashvili appeared straight out of central casting. To the west, his message \u2013 in fluent English \u2013 was simple: back me and you will help a young democracy in the volatile Caucasus escape the neo-Soviet orbit of Vladimir Putin's Russia.</p> <p>Disaster ensued. In 2008, Saakashvili attacked a rebel enclave, South Ossetia \u2013 with substantial provocation from Moscow \u2013 and lost it permanently. One-fifth of Georgia's territory is now occupied by Russian troops and pro-Russian separatists. Saakashvili's rashness and Russia's brutal reaction stopped Nato's eastward expansion dead in its tracks.</p> <p>The rose revolution grew out of protests against electoral fraud. Eduard Shevardnadze's Georgia was not a tyranny, but it was terminally corrupt. Like the roads, the writ of the state expired a few kilometres out of the capital, Tbilisi. Almost a decade on, the revolution's promise on this has been met. Corruption is no longer a tool of government and as a result Georgia's prison population has quadrupled.</p> <p>That would have been used as a boast by Saakashvili until 11 days ago, when video clips showing prison inmates being sodomised by broom handles were aired by two opposition television stations. The clips revealed the other face of Saakashvili's revolution \u2013 its incipient and growing authoritarianism. Since 2003, there has been no change of power through elections, and in Monday's parliamentary elections Saakashvili's ruling United National Movement is determined to keep it that way. Electoral lists have been <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1R5CF0yba4\" title=\"\">doctored</a>, opposition figures and human rights activists have been attacked and arrested. Satellite trucks belonging to opposition channels have been damaged. Disproportionate financial sanctions have been imposed for violations of election law.</p> <p>The target of Saakashvili's fear is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/30/saakashvili-georgia-rose-revolution-elections\" title=\"\">Bidzina Ivanishvili</a>, an oligarch whose wealth is equal to half of Georgia's GDP. After years of quiet philanthropy, Ivanishvili burst on to the scene as the head of the Georgian Dream coalition. Accused of being a creature of the Kremlin and of attempting to buy votes, he has seen his support mushroom and stands a good chance under free elections. Saakashvili faces the biggest challenge to his authority yet. He is due to stand down as president next year, but under constitutional changes, power will transfer to the prime minister. Who does this remind you of? Vladimir Putin? Surely not.</p>",
  "<p>The White House has defended its ambassador to the United Nations, Susan Rice, after criticism from Republicans determined to exploit the Obama administration's shifting position on the attack in Libya that killed the US ambassador.</p> <p>David Plouffe, a senior White House adviser, said on Sunday that Barack Obama had \"100% confidence\" in Rice, who initially described the Benghazi attack as a spontaneous assault in the wake of anti-US protests elsewhere in the Middle East.</p> <p>Late last week the White House began calling it a planned terrorist attack by forces who may have been linked to al-Qaida, prompting criticism of Rice from senior Republican figures.</p> <p>On Friday, Peter King, chairman of the House of Representatives homeland security committee, said Rice should resign for \"misinforming\" the American public in the interviews she gave in the aftermath of the attack. \"Somebody has to pay the price for this,\" he told CNN.</p> <p>Republicans sense an opportunity in what they regard as the White House's faltering reaction to the attack on the US consulate in Benghazi on 11 September, when a mob set fire to the building, killing the ambassador, Chris Stevens.</p> <p>After initially describing the attack as opportunistic in the wake of protests against an internet video made in the US that was offensive to Muslims, the White House changed tack. Speaking to reporters on the campaign trail on Thursday, White House spokesman Jay Carney described it as \"terrorism\".</p> <p>Libya's president, Mohamed Magariaf, has also blamed \"al-Qaida elements\" for the death of Stevens and three other Americans working for the state department.</p> <p>The issue is sensitive to the Obama campaign, which has made the killing of Osama bin Laden and the president's determination to beat al-Qaida a central plank of his re-election effort. Also, any suggestion that groups linked to al-Qaida were gaining ground in Libya would be a blow to the US-backed international coalition that mounted air strikes which eventually led to the downfall of the former Libyan leader, Colonel Muammar Gaddafi.</p> <p>In a statement on Friday, Shawn Turner, the director of public affairs for national intelligence, clarified the position. He said: \"In the immediate aftermath, there was information that led us to assess that the attack began spontaneously following protests earlier that day at our embassy in Cairo. We provided that initial assessment to executive branch officials and members of Congress, who used that information to discuss the attack publicly and provide updates as they became available. Throughout our investigation, we continued to emphasize that information gathered was preliminary and evolving.\"</p> <p>A lack of information about the circumstances of the attack has left open the question of whether it was planned in a few hours, to take advantage of a spontaneous anti-US protest in Egypt against the anti-Muslim video, or whether it was planned over longer term to mark the 11th anniversary of al-Qaida's 9/11 attacks on the US.</p> <p>In the NBC interview on Sunday, Plouffe defended the change of explanation for the Benghazi attack. \"I think now based on the recommendations and the investigation of the intelligence community, they made the decision to conclude that this was a terrorist attack. In the days after, that was not clear. This was a very fast-moving period of time \u2026 we provided information that we received from the intelligence community as we got it.\"</p> <p>Plouffe insisted that Rice had the full backing of the administration. Asked by Meet the Press host David Gregory if Barack Obama had \"100% confidence in her\", he said: \"Absolutely. She's done a terrific job for this country, for this administration.\"</p> <p>The response to the attack has rapidly become an election issue in the past few days. On Friday, the former New York mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who sought the Republican nomination for the presidency in 2008, accused the White House of a cover-up.</p> <p>Speaking to Fox News, Giuliani said: \"This is a deliberate attempt to cover up the truth, from an administration that claimed it wanted to be the most transparent in history. And it's the worst kind of cover-up: the kind of cover-up that involves our national security. This is a cover-up that involves the slaughter of four Americans.\"</p>",
  "<p>After an eventful year, China has cleared the decks for a wholesale change of leadership amid a particularly challenging set of circumstances. Turbo-powered growth has left the last major state ruled by a communist party facing a string of political, economic and social questions. The five-yearly party congress <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-19755035\" title=\"\">on 8 November</a>, which will appoint the new leaders to steer the country through the rest of this decade, is, therefore, as important in its way as the US presidential poll two days earlier.</p> <p>Whatever the faults of the US system, the contrast between the competitive election across the Pacific, held after months of open policy discussion, and the closed-door transition of power in China is striking. For all the praise from foreign commentators about the way China works, that contrast points to a significant weakness in the system that tries to guide the world's second largest economy on a path of \"scientific&#xa0;socialism\".</p> <p>It has now been 63 years since Mao Zedong proclaimed the People's Republic, and the market-led economic reforms launched at the end of the 1970s&#xa0;by his successor, Deng Xiaoping, have changed the country and the world&#xa0;beyond all measure. But the basic power equation has not budged, confronting those in charge with the task of containing a society that has been brought to prefer materialism to Marxism or Confucianism.</p> <p>In many ways this is healthy. The traditional ruling method, stretching back to the <a href=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/article_index/c/china_eastern_zhou_dynasty.aspx\" title=\"\">first emperor in 221 BC</a>, was patriarchal and despotic, and was picked up enthusiastically by the communists. But&#xa0;it sits on top of a country in which individuals enjoy a far greater degree of&#xa0;liberty, behaviour patterns are shifting fast, respect for authority is&#xa0;not what&#xa0;it was and technology \u2013 especially in the form of social media \u2013 has wrought a revolution.</p> <p>But the leadership, outgoing and incoming, acts as if nothing has changed. In the Leninist pecking order, the party ranks above the government and the real decisions are made in its politburo, which operates in the strictest secrecy. There is no open policy discussion. Control is everything. The institutions of civil society are absorbed into the official apparatus. Dissent is equated to subversion. Judges swear an oath of loyalty, not to China or to the legal system, but to the communist movement. The party's disciplinary commission can pick anybody up at will, without charge, and hold them for interrogation in a secret location.</p> <p>Occasionally, a corner of the curtain is lifted, as in the party's expulsion last week of the one-time rising star Bo Xilai, boss of the mega-municipality of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/mar/15/china.china\" title=\"\">Chongqing</a> (32 million inhabitants) till last spring. He was accused of \"grave violations of party discipline\", \"massive bribery\", \"improper sexual relations with multiple women\" and \"errors and culpability\" in the cases of former Chongqing police chief <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/24/china-police-chief-wang-lijun-jailed?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Wang Lijun</a>, and Bo's wife, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/sep/27/neil-heywood-unsafe-warns-scientist\" title=\"\">Gu Kailai</a>, who was convicted last month of the murder of British businessman Neil Heywood.</p> <p>Those charges may or may not be justified, but the fundamental reason for&#xa0;Bo's fall was the fear his ambition and ruthlessness aroused among his peers in the leadership, as he sought to join the supreme decision-making body, the politburo standing committee. For the last 10 years, under Hu Jintao, China&#xa0;has been run on consensus, a dictatorship without a dictator. That is certainly better than the days when Mao got out of bed in the afternoon and launched some adventurous scheme that brought death to millions. But it does not allow for the likes of Bo, who step out of the opaque central circle and plough their own furrow.</p> <p>The political defenestration of this champion of Mao-era values and of state control, who backed the use of the law against opponents, is no bad thing. But the way Bo's case was decided secretly by the politburo, after he disappeared, following his dismissal from his Chongqing post in the spring, is the antithesis of the rule of law. It was a power play in which the charges were personal, raising the question of how many others act similarly but evade censure by bowing to the rule of the centre.</p> <p>There was no debate about the policies Bo pursued \u2013 an awkward matter: Hu Jintao and his anointed successor, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/xi-jinping?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">Xi Jinping</a>, went to the city to sing the praises of the \"Chongqing model\", but since then, photographs of&#xa0;their visits have disappeared from Chinese websites.</p> <p>Such issues go to the heart of the challenge the People's Republic faces. Its essentially conservative leadership is&#xa0;stuck in a system of opaque, top-down rule. Like the emperors before them, the&#xa0;leaders fear that change may&#xa0;bring down the whole edifice. But if&#xa0;the party has no alternative, its model&#xa0;is reaching its limits.</p> <p>Deng made the economy the driver of&#xa0;national revival and the party's's recovery from the implosion of the Cultural Revolution, but expansion is slowing down, shot through with inefficiency and excess capacity, and paying the price for the failure to address crucial issues such as land ownership, labour movement, capital markets and water and energy supply. Though the party claims to stand for the people, there are an estimated 150,000 popular protests a year. The lack of trust people feel covers everything from food safety standards to official pronouncements \u2013 \"Only believe something when the government denies it,\" a saying goes. Corruption and yawning disparities of wealth fuel resentment. The environment is a mess and the demographics are heading the wrong&#xa0;way.</p> <p>Still, for most of its people, this is the best time to live in China during the&#xa0;modern era. The material and social strides made in the past few decades are indisputable. But they have brought the need for a new approach from the top, and time is running out. If the new leadership cannot forge that, China's future will be far more uncertain than its&#xa0;recent past.</p>",
  "<p>In a glass mountain-top palace that looms over Tbilisi like something from a Bond movie, Bidzina Ivanishvili talks fondly of his penguins. It's not true, he says, that he keeps them in a special refrigerator. \"I have a breed capable of standing normal temperatures,\" he explains. He also owns several lemurs, a herd of deer and a pet zebra \u2013 not to mention a stunning collection of modern art, all financed with a fortune made in Russia.</p> <p>The billionaire is leading the country's once-divided opposition into the most important election since the rose revolution swept the old order from power almost a decade ago. For the first time, Mikheil Saakashvili \u2013 the hero of that hour \u2013 faces a real challenge to his authority in parliamentary elections on Monday that could change the course of this corner of the Caucasus. </p> <p>The poll is bitterly contested. This small mountain nation (population: 4.5&#xa0;million) on the doorstep of Russia is more polarised than at any time since 1991 and independence from the Soviet Union. At stake is whether Georgia moves towards genuine democracy, or whether the rose revolution that swept Saakashvili to power in 2003 fizzles out.</p> <p>The country is also at the heart of a strategic battle between Moscow and the west. Russia insists Georgia is part of its backyard. To prove a point, it invaded in 2008 after Saakashvili unwisely tried to grab back rebel South Ossetia. Washington and the EU say Georgia is a sovereign nation that can decide its own destiny. Two geopolitical visions, Atlanticist and neo-Soviet, collide in a landscape of ancient villages, medieval towers and breathtaking mountains.</p> <p>Until recently, Saakashvili and his ruling United National Movement party had been expected to cruise to victory. All this changed after the release by two opposition TV stations 12 days ago of a horrific video showing prison officers abusing inmates and sodomising them with broom handles. \"When I watched it&#xa0;I thought it was a nightmare. The images were just awful,\" said Khatuna Kipiani, an opposition supporter.</p> <p>The video revealed something rotten at the heart of Georgia's state. It has appalled Georgian voters, embarrassed the authorities, and led to a surge of support for Georgia's opposition and for Ivanishvili, whose $6.4bn (\u00a34bn) fortune is put at half of Georgia's GDP. He burst on to the political scene a year ago, following years of quiet philanthropy in which he had paid for police uniforms, restored crumbling churches and funded salaries for actors and struggling artists \u2013 a sort of Georgian fairy godfather.</p> <p>His Georgian Dream coalition, named after a song by his rapper son, lags behind Saakashvili's ruling party in the ratings. But it is catching up, according to the latest polls. On Saturday evening, 100,000 Georgian Dream supporters packed into Tbilisi's central Rustaveli Avenue. \"It is as clear as day \u2013 we will win and achieve another victory in the history of our nation,\" Ivanishvili told them. \"We will not let anyone separate us from civilisation, modern times and democracy.\"</p> <p>His rise has spooked the government. It has variously dismissed him as a Kremlin stooge, a political dilettante, a \"weirdo\", and an old-style paternalist. Government aides mock his zoo, kept at his village home in western Georgia. They also say his sprawling coalition includes unsavoury elements, such as xenophobes and fans of Stalin, who was born in the Georgian town of Gori. But, undoubtedly, Ivanishvili has plugged into a mood of popular discontent and fatigue with Saakashvili, who critics say has become increasingly dictatorial.</p> <p>Ivanishvili dismisses the government's many charges against him and says that it is Saakashvili who is the monster: \"I'm very happy that I'm physically here and alive. You don't know Saakashvili's true face. He's capable of doing some atrocious things.\"</p> <p>Thousands of observers have flooded into Georgia for the election. Lobbyists hired by Ivanishvili have bombarded members of the US Congress and other opinion-makers with emails promoting Georgian Dream and accusing Saakashvili of treachery. The Georgian government has hit back: all international visitors to Georgia, a land of ancient viniculture, receive a free bottle of Saperavi wine from passport control. The government also says that Ivanishvili is using his money, made in the 1990s, to buy the election.</p> <p>In a report on Saturday, Transparency International, which describes itself as an anti-corruption organisation, blamed both sides for presenting \"simplistic programmes\" for increased social spending. For many voters, it is poverty and unemployment that have driven them to support Georgia's opposition.</p> <p>Sitting in a Tbilisi park on a warm evening, next to a statue of Giorgi Leonidze, a Georgian poet, Manana Nizharadze said she was surviving on a state pension of just 100 lari (\u00a337) a month. \"We live very badly. Wages are low. Communal charges are high. We can't afford medicines,\" she said. \"Saakashvili is a bad person.\"</p> <p>Edward Saakashvili, a distant relative of the president, demurred. \"He's done good things. People don't like discipline,\" he said, tossing back a glass of schnapps.</p> <p>Many voters complain of the president's disastrous 2008 war with Russia. Both South Ossetia and Abkhazia \u2013 which broke away in the 1990s \u2013 are now home to a massive Russian military presence. Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, who famously described how he wanted to \"hang Saakashvili by the balls\", conducted military exercises there last week, a crude reminder to Tbilisi that Moscow could reinvade any time.</p> <p>\"Shevadnadze lost the whole of Abkahzia. Misha [Saakashvili] lost Ossetia. It was a big mistake,\" said Nizharadze.</p> <p>Saakashvili's own future is unclear. He is 44 and due to step down as president in January 2013. His government has enacted constitutional changes that will transform Georgia next year from a presidential to a parliamentary republic. This has fuelled speculation that Saakashvili is planning to \"do a Putin\", and perform a job swap that would see him hang on to executive power by becoming prime minister.</p> <p>His government colleagues, however, are sceptical of such a manoeuvre. \"Politically it's impossible,\" said Giga Bokeria, secretary of Georgia's national security council.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 3 October 2012 to correct the population of Georgia from 4.7 million to 4.5 million.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama and Mitt Romney were gearing up on Sunday for three days of intense preparations for the first of the US presidential debates, which is almost certain to be the Republican candidate's last chance to turn around his struggling campaign.</p> <p>The 90-minute debate in Denver on Wednesday will be the first opportunity Americans will have to see the two candidates side by side and compare not only their policies but how they look and behave. The outcome could be decided by a hesitation in explaining a policy, a smart riposte or a display of arrogance.</p> <p>Each side took part in the usual ritual of talking up their opponent at the weekend in an attempt to dampen expectations. Paul Ryan, the Republican vice-presidential candidate, speaking on Fox News on Sunday, described Obama as \"a very gifted speaker\". Supporters of Obama claimed Romney had won nearly all of the debates during his gruelling nomination process.</p> <p>Estimates for the number of viewers in America range from 50 million to 60 million, almost double the number who watched the party conventions. There will be two additional debates, in Long Island and Florida, but it is the first that usually has the most impact.</p> <p>Obama, with significant poll leads in the swing states, can play defence, just getting through the evening without making a mistake. The onus is on Romney to make an impression.</p> <p>Chris Christie, the Republican governor of New Jersey, acknowledged on NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday that Romney would need to do well in the first debate. \"You're going to have tens of millions of people for the first time really tuning in and paying attention to this race ... On Thursday morning the entire narrative of this race is going to change.\"</p> <p>Both candidates were readying themselves for three days of intensive preparation. Obama, after a campaign event in Las Vegas on Sunday night, heads to Henderson half-an-hour's drive away for three days of preparation. Romney will also do three days of preparation, arriving in Denver Monday.</p> <h2>Do debates make a difference?</h2> <p>Some political analysts argue that the debates do not matter, usually ending inconclusively and quickly forgotten. Others point to debate moments over the last 52 years, since the first televised debate between Kennedy and Nixon, that have turned out to decisive.</p> <p>John McCain, failed Republican presidential candidate in 2008, who has debated with both Obama and Romney, did not anticipate any \"breakthrough\" moments, saying they they have become rarer in recent decades.</p> <p>\"I can't remember the last time there was one of these comments that grabbed everybody's attention because, frankly, the candidates are too well prepared,\" McCain told CNN on Sunday.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396937031\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/09/27/0926_stage_460x276.jpg\" alt=\"Barack Obama and John McCain\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Then Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama and  John McCain in their first presidential debate in 2008. Photograph: Win McNamee/Getty</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Win McNamee/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But debates can dramatically change a campaign. Hillary Clinton was a seemingly insurmountable 30 points ahead of Obama in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination until she hesitated when asked a question in a 2007 debate about illegal immigration. </p> <p>Tad Devine, a Democratic strategist involved in presidential campaigns from Mondale in 1984 through to Kerry in 2004, believes debates are important. He recalled Mondale jumped 23 points in a poll after having a good first debate with Reagan and that Gore lost a three to four point lead in 2000 after his debate with George W Bush.</p> <p>He argues it is possible for Romney to use the debate to mount a comeback.</p> <p>\"Romney has got to get himself back into the race. He needs voters to have one more look at him and this is it,\" said Devine.</p> <p>\"If the Romney team are smart, they will not try to do it all in the first debate. They need to make up some ground and get people to like this guy a little. It is all about how he comports himself. If they are smart and he starts repairing his image, you can change a lot in 90 minutes.\"</p> <h2>Preparations</h2> <p>Romney's campaign team has long argued that the debates are pivotal and, because of that, the candidate has been rehearsing since at least August, locking himself away for mock-up debates with senator Rob Portman from Ohio standing in for Obama.</p> <p>According to the Obama team, the president has had less time to prepare because of his White House duties, though he has occasionally taken time out for visits to the Democratic national committee's headquarters in Washington for debate sessions, with senator John Kerry standing in for Romney.</p> <p>The preparations at the rival camps will be intensive, with soundbites rehearsed over and over again. They will prepare on replicas of the Denver stage, the rehearsals filmed and analysed. </p> <p>Obama, with a tendency for long answers, is being encouraged by staff to be snappier. One of his advisers, Jen Psaki, said last week: \"The president is familiar with his own loquaciousness and his tendency to give long, substantive answers.\" </p> <p>The relentless preparations include appearance as well as policy, with ties and suits chosen to avoid blending in with the stage backdrop.</p> <p>Devine remembers that, in spite of all the detailed preparations for one Gore-Bush debate, one of the problems was a failure to check how Gore's make-up would look on camera. Viewers complained he looked \"too orangey\".</p> <h2>Expectations</h2> <p>It has become commonplace that, ahead of the debates, the two camps talk up the opposing candidate in an effort to lower expectations. Romney supporters talk up Obama's oratorical skills, while the president's campaign has been claiming that Romney has had a great deal of practice at debates during his nomination process.</p> <p>In reality, neither candidate is a great debater. Often forgotten is that Obama, while one of the best orators in the US, performed poorly at debates during the during Democratic primaries and caucuses before the 2008 election, though he improved towards the end. The White House spokesman, Jay Carney, at the time a reporter, admitted last week that Obama had become the nominee in 2008 \"in spite of his debate performances\".</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396937032\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/1/20/1327024713757/Mitt-Romney-and-Newt-Ging-007.jpg\" alt=\"Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich in the CNN debate\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich in a CNN debate earlier this year.

Obama will seek to exploit this to the fullest while Romney has to try to explain it away.</p> <p>Romney's success against Gingrich in debate was attributed at the time to his debate coach, Brett O'Donnell, who subsequently left his staff. O'Donnell, in an interview with the Associated Press last week, said Romney has to try to confront the 47% remark. \"He has to turn the 47% and make sure people understand the reasoning behind that argument, how that's the result of the president's policies.\"</p> <p>The dominant issue will be the slow economic recovery, from an unemployment rate over 8% to the burgeoning deficit and taxation. Other issues will be healthcare reform, immigration and women's rights. Foreign policy is not on the agenda until the final debate.</p> <h2>Debates that made a difference</h2> <p>The first televised debate between Kennedy and Nixon in 1960 cost the Republican the election. Kennedy looked better on television while Nixon appeared unshaven and ill at ease.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396937033\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2008/10/14/kennedy460.jpg\" alt=\"John F Kennedy, Richard Nixon, 1960 presidential debate \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John F Kennedy and Richard Nixon wait for the start of their televised presidential debate on 26 September 1960.  Photograph: CBS archives</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: CBS Photo Archive/CBS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There was a long gap in debates until they resumed in 1976. In 1980, Reagan won a debate and the election with the question \"Ask yourself, 'Are you better off now than you were four years ago?'\"</p> <p>Gore came off second best in a debate with Bush in 2000. Devine recalled that the Gore team thought it had won but the Bush campaign successfully spun to the press that Gore had looked arrogant, sighing repeatedly throughout the debate and rolling is eyes. The spin worked.</p>",
  "<p>\u2022 For aides to Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, these tense days before the first presidential debate on Wednesday have been dominated by a tradition as familiar and ritualised, in its way, as the Running of the Bulls, or the Changing of the Guard, except arguably more preposterous.</p> <p>The Lowering of the Expectations began in earnest last week, when campaign advisers \u2013 who had spent years promoting their candidate as the greatest leader in American history \u2013 performed a brake-screeching U-turn.</p> <p>When it comes to debating, Obama's spokespeople insist he's a walking disaster: prone to getting testy, four years out of practice, and far too busy with world events. Team Romney have their mirror-image arguments: Obama is the greatest orator of modern times, and Romney hasn't debated with a Democrat in 10 years. \"It is hard to imagine anyone outscoring Obama in debate points,\" Romney's spokeswoman,<a href=\"http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/250579-dnc-is-hq-for-obamas-debate-prep\" title=\"\"> Andrea Saul, told the Washington newspaper The Hill</a>. The logic behind this tactic is embarrassingly obvious: persuade everyone to expect a screw-up, and then if your man ends up doing just about respectably \u2013 refraining, say, from slowly removing all his underwear on stage while explaining how 9/11 was an inside job \u2013 it must surely be counted a stunning victory.</p> <p>\u2022 The truth is that both candidates \u2013 Obama, preparing furiously <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/09/president-obamas-debate-prep-partner-has-some-questions-about-benghazi/\" title=\"\">at a resort outside Las Vegas</a>; Romney, in New England \u2013 are talented debaters. Either man could \"win\" their confrontation at the University of Colorado Denver, which will be moderated by the veteran news anchor<a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/about/news/archive/2012/jim-lehrer-presidential-debate/\" title=\"\"> Jim Lehrer</a>.</p> <p>Romney will be hoping to lure Obama into one of his rare but striking displays of mean-spiritedness (\"You're likable enough, Hillary,\" he famously sneered at his Democratic rival in 2008). The president, for his part, may be content to let a Romney gaffe happen, as they all too frequently seem to do. (Much mockery greeted a report in the New York Times that Romney, a man not renowned for his successful attempts at humour in public, had prepared \"a series of zingers that he has memorised and has been practising on aides since August\".)</p> <p>And nobody really doubts that the pressure is disproportionately on the Republican: with polls<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/27/romney-polls-enthusiasm-virginia-rally\" title=\"\"> suggesting victory is sliding ever further from his grasp</a>, a mere debate win, as judged by America's cable-news commentariat, won't be sufficient to reverse his fortunes. But a significant stumble could serve as a death knell.</p> <p>\u2022 In reality, however, what is most likely to happen is this: the three debates next month will provide plenty of fodder for analysts and satirists, while having virtually no impact on the outcome. This isn't solely because <a href=\"http://campaignstops.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/20/the-a-little-bit-less-undecided/\" title=\"\">94% of American voters have already made up their minds this time around.</a> It's also because, as research by the political scientist James Stimson has shown, presidential debates are almost never decisive.</p> <p>In no White House race between 1960 and 2000, Stimson's polling analyses found, could any \"substantial shift\" in the polls be traced to the debates. Even JFK's legendary encounter with a pale and stubbly Richard Nixon in 1960 helped the Democrat only marginally, by fewer points than Obama now leads Romney. The story that radio listeners thought Nixon had won, while TV viewers deserted him in droves, is a <a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10510978709368226#preview\" title=\"\">myth</a>.</p> <p>John Kerry won all his debates with George Bush in 2004, according to public opinion surveys \u2013 yet he's been reduced to the role of pretending to be Mitt Romney for Obama's debate rehearsals. As another political scientist, John Sides, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/septemberoctober_2012/ten_miles_square/do_presidential_debates_really039413.php?page=1\" title=\"\">pointed out recently in the Washington Monthly</a>, candidates prepare obsessively, memorise talking points and insist on formats that minimise the chances of disaster, so it's hardly surprising they \"tend to fight to a draw\". Precisely because a much-watched debate could be so momentous, the candidates in effect conspire to ensure that it won't be.</p> <p>\u2022 None of which means that they won't make compelling viewing. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senator,_you%27re_no_Jack_Kennedy\" title=\"\">\"Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy\"</a> might not have stopped Dan Quayle becoming vice-president, but it constitutes the best political putdown since Churchill, rivalled only by Ronald Reagan's<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoPu1UIBkBc\" title=\"\"> response in a 1984 debate </a>to concerns about his age: \"I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, [Walter Mondale's] youth and inexperience\".</p> <p>Al Gore's awkwardness in debates with George Bush spoke eloquently, and not necessarily negatively, of the unpolished man behind the media facade. Even John McCain's 2008 fixation on Joe the Plumber \u2013 he mentioned him 13 times in the first 10 minutes of one debate \u2013 seemed to crystallise that campaign's absurdity. It helped that the Everyman in question was neither really called Joe, nor, by some accounts, a properly licensed plumber.</p> <p>How, in the end, could a confrontation between two people sufficiently strange to want to be the president of the US fail to be fascinating? It's a pity, of course, that presidential debates should have been reduced to little more than entertainment.</p> <p>Still, considered on those terms alone, there's every reason to approach Wednesday night with high expectations.</p>",
  "<p>Just after his inauguration, President Barack Obama made a pledge: to cut the nation's $1.3tn deficit in half by the end of his first term. Sunday marks a sobering day for the president and his promise \u2013 the end of another fiscal year with a deficit surpassing $1tn.</p> <p>Despite marginal improvements this is the fourth straight year that the deficit has passed the $1tn mark, adding to a national debt that passed $16tn for the first time this year.</p> <p>Obama inherited an economy in crisis only to find the situation was even worse than it appeared. He also inherited wars and tax cuts that have drained the nation's coffers. But his own decisions, including a massive stimulus programme, as well as those beyond his control, have increased the US's debt by $6tn under his watch. The size of the deficit and Obama's failure to tackle it are likely to be hot topics as the president squares off with Mitt Romney for the first presidential debate on Wednesday.</p> <p>Romney and his vice-presidential pick Paul Ryan have hammered Obama's record on debt. \"When he came into office, there was just over $10tn in debt. Now there's over $16tn in debt. If he were re-elected, I can assure you it will be almost $20tn in debt,\" Romney told voters in Ohio last week. \"And by the way, those debts get passed on to our kids. It's not just bad for the economy; it's not just bad for our job creation; it will \u2026 in my opinion, it is immoral for us to pass on obligations like that to the next generation.\"</p> <p>Romney has said he plans to balance the annual budget in eight to 10 years but has given scant details of exactly how that will be achieved. Obama's most recent budget proposal called for $5.3tn in deficit reduction over the next decade. Again, details are in short supply. The president's budget claims the deficit will be $901bn in 2013, better but still far short of his $650bn promise.</p> <p>For most people it simply doesn't matter, until it does, said Ken Goldstein, economist at The Conference Board in New York. \"Walk into any bar tonight and ask 20 people and I bet not one of them knows what the deficit is or what it means. It's abstract, we don't feel it. Its impact is indirect and it's not immediate.\"</p> <p>All that could change come 31 December \u2013 the fiscal cliff \u2013 when Bush-era tax cuts are set to expire and a draconian round of spending cuts will be implemented unless a political compromise can be reached.</p> <p>The tax hike will increase the tax burden by $380bn while the spending cuts take $100bn out of the economy. The cuts to defence and social programmes were agreed in order to force a compromise between Democrats and Republicans on a plan to reduce the deficit. But a \"super commitee\" set up to find a third way failed leaving the cuts in place.</p> <p>Goldstein said the fiscal cliff could make the abstract concrete as taxpayers absorb another knock to their finances and the swingeing cuts strike at a national and local level.</p> <p>\"Consumers and businesses are already dealing with three plus years of austerity. We would be piling austerity on austerity,\" he said. The congressional budget office has warned that failure to tackle the fiscal cliff would cause a \"significant recession\" and the loss of some 2m jobs.</p> <p>\"This will not be easy,\" Obama said as he made his pledge to cut the debt in half. \"It will require us to make difficult decisions and face challenges we've long neglected. But I refuse to leave our children with a debt that they cannot repay \u2013 and that means taking responsibility right now, in this administration, for getting our spending under control.\"</p> <p>Four years later that sense of urgency is growing, and so is America's debt.</p>",
  "<p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Georgians are preparing for the most important election since the rose revolution swept the old order from power almost a decade ago, with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/mikheilsaakashvili\" title=\"\">Mikheil Saakashvili</a>, the hero of that hour, facing a very real challenge to his authority.</p> <p>Before parliamentary elections on Monday, the mood in Georgia is tense and febrile. The poll is bitterly contested. This small mountain nation in the southern Caucasus \u2013 on the doorstep of mighty Russia \u2013 is now more polarised than at any time since 1991 and independence from the Soviet Union. At stake is whether Georgia, population 4.7 million, moves towards genuine democracy, or whether the rose revolution that swept Saakashvili to power in 2003 fizzles out.</p> <p>The country is also at the heart of a strategic battle between Moscow and the west. Russia insists Georgia is part of its backyard. To prove a point, it invaded in 2008 after Saakashvili unwisely tried to grab back rebel South Ossetia. Washington and the EU say Georgia is a sovereign nation that can decide its own destiny. Two geopolitical visions \u2013 Atlanticist and neo-Soviet \u2013 collide here in a landscape of ancient villages and the breathtaking Caucasus mountains.</p> <p>Until recently Saakashvili and his ruling United National Movement party had been expected to cruise to victory. All this changed after the release by two opposition TV stations 12 days ago of a horrific video showing prison officers <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/19/georgia-prison-guards-torture-video\" title=\"\">abusing inmates and sodomising them with broom handles</a>. \"When I watched it I thought it was a nightmare. The images were just awful,\" said Khatuna Kipiani, an opposition supporter in the capital, Tbilisi.</p> <p>The video revealed something rotten at the heart of Georgia's state. It has appalled Georgian voters, embarrassed the authorities, and led to a surge of support for Georgia's opposition and its leader <a href=\"http://www.rferl.org/content/bidzina-ivanishivili-georgia-wild-card-elections/24724299.html\" title=\"\">Bidzina Ivanishvili</a>, whose $6.4bn (\u00a34bn) fortune is put at half of Georgia's GDP. He burst on to the political scene last year, following years of quiet philanthropy in which he had paid for police uniforms, restored crumbling churches and gave salaries to actors and struggling artists, a sort of Georgian fairy godmother.</p> <p>His <a href=\"http://www.georgiandream.ge/eng,georgian-dream-coalition\" title=\"\">Georgian Dream coalition</a>, named after a song by his rapper son, lags behind Saakashvili's ruling party in the ratings. But it is catching up, according to the latest polls.</p> <p>On Saturday evening, 100,000 Georgian Dream supporters packed into Tbilisi's main Rustaveli Avenue. \"It is as clear as day \u2013 we will win and achieve another victory in the history of our nation,\" Ivanishvili told them. \"We will not let anyone separate us from civilisation, modern times and democracy.\"</p> <p>His rise has spooked the government. It has variously dismissed him as a Kremlin stooge, a political dilettante, a \"weirdo\", and an old-style paternalist. Government aides point out that he keeps a zoo at his home in western Georgia, with his penguins housed in a special refrigerator. They also say his sprawling coalition includes unsavoury elements, such as xenophobes and fans of Stalin, who was born in the Georgian town of Gori. But, undoubtedly, Ivanishvili has plugged into a mood of popular discontent and fatigue with Saakashvili, who critics say has become increasingly dictatorial.</p> <p>Some thousands of observers have flooded into Georgia for Monday's poll. Lobbyists hired by Ivanishvili have bombarded members of the US |Congress and other opinion-makers with emails promoting Georgian Dream and accusing Saakashvili of treachery. The government has hit back: all international visitors to Georgia, a land of ancient viniculture, receive a free bottle of Saperavi wine from passport control. The government says Ivanishvili is using his money, made in Russia in the 1990s, to buy the election.</p> <p>In a report on Saturday, Transparency International, which describes itself as an anti-corruption organisation, blamed both sides for presenting \"simplistic programmes\" for increased social spending.</p> <p>For many voters, it is poverty and unemployment that have driven them to support Georgia's opposition. Sitting in a Tbilisi park on a warm evening \u2013 next to a statue of Giorgi Leonidze, a Georgian poet \u2013 Manana Nizharadze said she was surviving on a state pension of just 100 lari (\u00a337) a month.</p> <p>\"We live very badly. Wages are low. Communal charges are high. We can't afford medicines,\" she said. \"Saakashvili is a bad person.\"</p> <p>Edward Saakashvili \u2013 a distant relative of the president \u2013 demurred. \"He's done good things. People don't like discipline,\" he said, tossing back a glass of schnapps.</p> <p>Many voters complain of the president's disastrous 2008 war with Russia. Both South Ossetia and Abkhazia \u2013 which broke away in the 1990s \u2013 are now home to a massive Russian military presence. Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, who famously described how he wanted to \"hang Saakashvili by the balls\", conducted military exercises there last week, a crude reminder to Tbilisi that Moscow could re-invade any time. \"Shevadnadze lost the whole of Abkahzia. Misha [Saakashvili] lost Ossetia. It was a big mistake,\" said Nizharadze.</p> <p>Saakashvili's own future is unclear. He is 44 and due to step down as president in January 2013. His government has enacted constitutional changes that will transform Georgia next year from a presidential to a parliamentary republic. This has fuelled speculation that Saakashvili is planning to \"do a Putin\", and perform a job swap that would see him hang on to executive power by becoming prime minister.</p> <p>His government colleagues, however, are sceptical of such a manoeuvre. \"Politically it's impossible,\" said Giga Bokeria, secretary of Georgia's national security council.</p>",
  "<p>It took just over four months for the tide of public opinion to turn against Fran\u00e7ois Hollande: at the start of September a poll revealed that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/02/french-pessimistic-francois-hollande\" title=\"\">68% of French people were pessimistic about their country's future under their new president</a>. And that was the common line before <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19763665\" title=\"\">Friday's announcement of the 2013 budget</a>, which will find him even fewer friends in the country.</p> <p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Moscovici\" title=\"\">Pierre Moscovici</a>, the finance minister, has boasted that no previous government has attempted to reduce the budget deficit by 1.5% in a single year \u2013 from 4.5% to 3% \u2013 and all that with almost nonexistent growth. But it is precisely this kind of ministerial pride that French people are worried about \u2013 whether they belong to the group who will be heavily taxed or are one of those 3 million unemployed who can't see how the austerity budget will help them find a job.</p> <p>Admittedly, a drop in popularity will have always been part of Hollande's calculations. With no elections for another two years, his government will feel it is wiser to take tough measures now rather than later, hoping that positive results will show when voters go back to the polls. Two years: that's the period president Hollande has said would be needed to turn the clock back on unemployment.</p> <p>Still, the proposed budget is far more of a shock than anyone could have predicted only a few weeks ago. It promises to achieve the eurozone-wide 3% budget deficit ceiling as early as 2013, a target Hollande has maintained despite the deterioration of the economy, with a mild recession under way.</p> <p>To do so will require a major effort, whose chance of success has divided opinions. The government needs to find an additional \u20ac30bn next year, and has chosen to divide this amount in three: one-third in spending cuts, and two-thirds in new taxes \u2013 half for businesses and half for individual taxpayers.</p> <p>Liberal economists criticise this division: they argue that state spending should have been cut much further, with fewer new taxes in a country that is already one of the bigger taxers in Europe. They fear job creation will suffer as both businesses and consumers are forced to tighten their belts. Technology entrepreneurs have been particularly vocal since Friday, complaining about a 60% tax on profits when selling a company \u2013 a sharp increase which, they say, will discourage the innovation sector.</p> <p>On the other side, leftwing critics of the socialists such as the former presidential candidate <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/jean-luc-melenchon\" title=\"\">Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon</a> denounce an austerity package designed to satisfy financial markets and Europe's liberal vision, which is not what Hollande promised the French in his campaign against Nicolas Sarkozy.</p> <p>The \"left of the left\" is showing its muscle today, with a major demonstration planned in Paris against Hollande's choice to ratify the new European budgetary treaty in parliament, and not by referendum. The austerity measures in the new budget will have given leftwing voters an additional reason to join the march.</p> <p>Government spokesmen defend their approach as both orthodox and fair. Moscovici made a passionate plea for the reduction of the budget deficit \u2013 and therefore the French debt burden \u2013 in an <a href=\"http://fr.reuters.com/article/topNews/idFRPAE88S02620120929\" title=\"\">interview with Le Monde this weekend</a>. He defended a \"just\" approach in which the tax burden will fall on big corporations and not small and medium-sized companies, and called upon the 10% richest French people to save the nation's social system. \"Rigorous but leftwing\", cheered the left-leaning Lib\u00e9ration, in a rather Pravda-like fashion.</p> <p>Unlike the worst-affected states of southern Europe, France has apparently not given up on saving its generous social system \u2013 while simultaneously following an orthodox path of deficit reduction. The budget has allowed the country to gain time, and France is currently borrowing on financial markets at record low, sometimes even negative, rates.</p> <p>All this is a far cry from former president Sarkozy's gloomy warning during last spring's election campaign: \"Vote for Hollande and you'll have a Greek-style situation in less than two weeks.\"</p> <p>Hollande's gamble is to put the country's finances in order without having to go through the deep and painful cuts that Spain is imposing on its people, or the hard and equally painful social reforms that Germany underwent years ago.</p> <p>Mission impossible? The answer will emerge in the next few months, in the toughest economic environment possible.</p>",
  "<p>On Friday morning, Politico ran <a href=\"http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=0665D7E1-13A2-45EC-876F-271DC28CA86A\">an article</a> that chiefly attributed President Obama's lead to Mitt Romney and his failures. Salon's Steve Kornacki came to the <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/09/28/sorry_its_not_romneys_fault/\">opposite conclusion</a> and concludes that the fundamentals of this cycle made Romney's task of deposing Obama quite difficult. So, which is it?</p> <p>There are really two ways to measure the fundamentals: approval ratings and economic statistics. Both metrics try to assess how the contest stands without taking into account the opposing candidate's characteristics. Approvals incorporate other factors, such as an incumbent's strengths on other issues unrelated to the economy.</p> <p>Before the campaign really got under way, in April and May, Obama's <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/124922/Presidential-Approval-Center.aspx?ref=interactive\">average Gallup approval rating</a> was 47%. That figure of 47% isn't great \u2013 but it's not bad, either. During the past <a href=\"http://webapps.ropercenter.uconn.edu/CFIDE/roper/presidential/webroot/presidential_rating.cfm\">11 elections</a> where an incumbent ran for re-election and there was a Gallup poll (all since 1940, save 1944), there has been a statistical trend for the president's approval rating to rise during the campaign.&#xa0;</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396912188\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/30/1348959722868/ApprovalGallup-1.jpg\" alt=\"Approvals, Gallup\" width=\"460\" height=\"335\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Obama's Gallup approval rating has risen to about 49.7% since the conventions. If that holds through the election, it's right about where we would expect Obama's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/may/16/2012-race-obama-approvals-romneys-favorables\">final approval</a> to be, given his April/May approval, based on the out-of-sample prediction from the previous 11 elections. In other words, by this measure, any effect Romney's ineptness might have had is minimal.</p> <p>We can also predict Obama's margin of victory from his April/May approval rating. A 47% approval in April/May forecasts Obama to win the election by 3.4 percentage points. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396912189\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/30/1348959758064/ResultApproval-1.jpg\" alt=\"Result v approvals\" width=\"460\" height=\"335\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Obama's average lead over the past three weeks of Gallup polling is 4 percentage points. Obama's right where he should be, then, based on his approval when the campaign began. In fact, despite being out-of-sample, Obama's fits the line the best out of any of the data points. </p> <p>Some might say that Obama's approval is based in part on his high favorability. Thus, a stronger opponent could have knocked Obama a peg or two, particularly with a strong economic case.</p> <p>Measuring the economy is difficult to do because there are many different metrics and they often diverge. Also, many economy-based models include other factors not related to the economy.</p> <p>Bob Erikson and Chris Wlezien get around this messiness <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/0226922154\">by turning</a> to a leading economic indicator growth variable that incorporates ten economic statistics. A model based off only this economic index for every election since 1952 predicts that President Obama should win the election by 5 points. In other words, even the economy paints Obama as a favorite. This figure not incidentally matches the margin that a model based on <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/28/approval-ratings-and-re-election-odds/\">November Gallup approval</a> would estimate, given Obama's 50% approval rating.&#xa0;</p> <p>Much of the reasoning that the state of the economy made Obama the underdog derives from a misunderstanding of how the economy relates to presidential elections. Many people look only at the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/jan/10/obamas-reelection-prospects-hard-numbers\">absolute statistics</a> \u2013 but it is growth, specifically late growth, that is most important. Other models are solid, but aren't purely based on economic measures. Looking at an ensemble of these forecasts collected created by Jacob Montgomery, Florian Hollenbach and Michael Ward, Obama is <a href=\"http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayJournal?jid=PSC\">still favored</a> to win 60% of the time.</p> <p>So what about the idea that Mitt Romney is supposedly a dismally poor candidate? We can measure Romney's crumminess by examining his favorable ratings. I dug through the <a href=\"http://www.ropercenter.uconn.edu/\">Roper archives</a> and found three pollsters with favorable ratings taken during the final week of the campaign dating back to at least 1992. Gallup has favorables since 1988. CBS goes back to 1980. From each of these pollsters, I took the tightest screen (that is, likely voters when available or possibly estimated).</p> <p>The result is that <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/romney_favorableunfavorable-1134.html\">Romney's favorables</a> are bad, but probably not the worst of any recent presidential candidate. Romney's latest net favorable (favorable minus unfavorable) in the <a href=\"http://desmond.imageshack.us/Himg542/scaled.php?server=542&amp;filename=picture139h.jpg&amp;res=landing\">CBS poll</a> is -1 percentage point. If that holds through the election, there have been eight major party candidates with an equal or worse favorable rating since 1980, including Jimmy Carter, Walter Mondale, Michael Dukakis, Bill Clinton, Bob Dole, John Kerry, and John McCain.</p> <p>Romney's net favorables rank worse historically in <a href=\"http://desmond.imageshack.us/Himg542/scaled.php?server=542&amp;filename=picture139h.jpg&amp;res=landing\">Gallup and NBC/Wall Street Journal's polls</a>. Even then, his Gallup +2 net favorable is better than either Michael Dukakis's in 1988 and George HW Bush's in 1992 at the end of the campaign. NBC/Wall Street Journal -5 net favorable rating is equal to President George HW Bush's in 1992. Romney's net favorables would, no doubt, be better than Democratic presidential candidates were in the 1980s if these pollsters surveyed voters in the 1980 and 1984. As I said, Romney is not viewed favorably, but his deficit is not historically exceptional.</p> <p>Part of the reason that many think Romney's poor standing is historic is because Pew Research's data <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2012/09/19/obama-ahead-with-stronger-support-better-image-and-lead-on-most-issues/\">has said it is</a>. The problem, in my opinion, is that Pew is mixing its data from this year with Gallup's from the past. Pew has been <a href=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2012-09-28-delta.png\">consistently one of the more favorable pollsters</a> for President Obama in 2012.</p> <p>What is often not discussed is that despite a reputation as likable figure, Obama's <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/obama_favorableunfavorable-643.html\">net favorables</a> are actually quite low compared to past candidates. According to CBS, eight presidential candidates since 1980 had an equal or better net favorable at the end of the campaign than Obama does right now. Nine since 1988 had an equal or better favorable rating than Gallup found in their last poll. Six since 1992 had a better favorable per NBC data.</p> <p>Why are both Obama and Romney's favorable ratings so low? It could be that the electorate is <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2012/06/04/partisan-polarization-surges-in-bush-obama-years/\">more polarized</a> than at any point in the last 25 years.</p> <p>The way we can really compare 2012 to prior years is to look at the difference between the candidates' favorability. The difference in the net favorables of the candidates in CBS's data among likely voters is smaller than in every other election since 1980. The gap in 2012 tied for the second smallest next to 2004 according to Gallup. For NBC, it is in the middle of the pack. In other words, 2012 should be a close to moderate victory for Obama based off <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/18/do-romneys-favorability-ratings-matter/\">past data</a>.</p> <p>Another key point is that Romney's favorability \"problem\" may itself be determined by the fundamentals. Favorable ratings don't happen in a shell: people's view about a challenger relates at least partially to whether they like the job the incumbent is doing.&#xa0;</p> <p>Not surprisingly, then,&#xa0;when incumbents run for re-election,&#xa0;the favorability gap in the <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/18/do-romneys-favorability-ratings-matter/\">late stages</a> of the campaign is tied to an incumbent's approval rating in April and May. I went back in the Roper archive and plotted the incumbent's approval rating against the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/may/16/2012-race-obama-approvals-romneys-favorables\">favorability gap in the final months</a> since 1980.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396912190\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/30/1348959917209/Approvalvsfavorable-1.jpg\" alt=\"Approval v favorables\" width=\"460\" height=\"335\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>There are only five observations from past years, so caution must be taken, but the trend is pretty clear. In fact, 94% of the favorability gap in the final months of the campaign is explained by the president's approval back in April and May. Because Obama's approval in CBS's lone April/May poll was 48%, Obama is estimated to have a net favorability edge of 13 points over Romney. Obama's lead in net favorables among registered voters was 11 points in CBS's last poll, is about 9 points in the Real Clear Politics average, and was only 1 point in the last CBS poll among likely voters.&#xa0;</p> <p>In short, Romney's favorability problem seems either well predicted by Obama's approval strength before the campaign started or actually not anywhere near as bad as might have been expected.&#xa0;</p> <p>There is no proof here that Romney is losing because he's a weak candidate. Romney's problem with the electorate probably has little to do with Romney himself. The reason Romney has struggled is that Obama was in a relatively strong position, thanks in part to economic growth, before many voters could even form an opinion about him.</p>"
