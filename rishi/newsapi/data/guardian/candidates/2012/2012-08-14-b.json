  "<p>The war drums have been beating \u2013 again \u2013 in Israel. The latest alarm was started by two usually well-briefed journalists, Nahum Barnea and Shimon Shiffer, who <a href=\"http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/politics/2012/08/for-and-against-an-attack-the-pr.html\" title=\"\">wrote</a> that an Israeli attack on Iran's nuclear facilities could come in weeks, rather than months, and before the US presidential election in November. Their story contained a caveat: if the decision to attack were up to Binyamin Netanyahu and Ehud Barak alone. Because plainly, it is not.</p> <p>The enthusiasm of Israel's prime minister and defence minister for an air strike on Iran appears to have united their country's defence and security establishment against them, including Israel's new <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/14/israel-security-minister-iran-weapons\" title=\"\">minister for homeland security</a>. The two have yet even to convince their own inner cabinet. But the report was taken so seriously that Barnea amended it on Monday by speculating that Barak, the thinly disguised source, may be trying to cover his own back, in the knowledge that such an attack will never be launched. Barak's reasoning depends only partially on Iran's alleged actions, and the latest US intelligence assessment that Tehran now possesses 170 kilograms of medium-enriched uranium, from which it is relatively easy to produce bomb-grade material. Barak is worried that so many centrifuges are being hidden underground that they will soon be out of Israel's military reach. After that point, Israel will have to rely on a US president it suspects will never order an attack .</p> <p>Barak's case for an airstrike now is peppered with inconsistencies \u2013 not least the calculation that if Israel attacked, Iran would be rational enough not to retaliate against US military targets in the Gulf and hence the regional war everyone feared would not materialise. This confidence is not shared by his military chiefs. But to take Barak's war-gaming at face value, if Iran were rational enough to contain its response, it would prove that deterrence works for a state Netanyahu continues to describe as an irrational actor motivated by messianism. If Barak is right, the deterrence of mutually assured destruction would work all the more if Iran acquired a bomb, particularly as Israel has several hundred of them.</p> <p>Loud talk of an impending airstrike could be no more than an attempt to twist Washington's arm. If it is, nothing should stiffen Barack Obama's resolve to prevent it happening more than the thought that Netanyahu is not just playing politics in his own country but in America too. Netanyahu foolishly dares Obama not to cast his veto, because if he did, Mitt Romney his Republican challenger would make hay with the idea that the Democat in the White House endangers Israel's security. This lever will no longer work after the election, hence the November deadline. Even as bluff it is dangerous, and eminently combustible in a tinder-dry Middle East.</p>",

His campaign has been swamped by negative ads and tripped over its own feet on a disastrous foreign trip that even the Economist labelled \"a horn-honking, floppy-shoed clown show\". The result has been a slew of poor polls and the choice of radical Wisconsin congressman Paul Ryan as a \"game-changing\" running-mate (reminding everyone of the dynamic that prompted John McCain to take a risk on Sarah Palin in 2008).</p> <p>Well, Romney does not seem to be able to do much to stop his gaffes, including introducing Ryan as the \"next president of the United States\". But he apparently does think he can do something about President Barack Obama's highly effective attack ads. Hence the launch today of this defensive ad complaining about how mean the president is being.</p> <h2>What</h2> <p>The 30-second television spot is called \"America Deserves Better\". It aims at blunting a controversial spot from a pro-Obama Super Pac called Priorities USA Action. That ad, which claimed a man's wife had died of cancer after losing healthcare when Romney's old firm Bain shut down a factory, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/14/swiftboating-mitt-romney-disgraces-barack-obama\">has caused a firestorm of criticism</a> \u2013 including from some Democrat strategists and media allies. This ad is aiming to build on that backlash.</p> <h2>When</h2> <p>It came out originally at the end of last week, but has been re-released to coincide with Obama's trip to Iowa Tuesday.</p> <h2>Where</h2> <p>It is running in Iowa, trying to persuade the Hawkeye State that gave Obama his big break in 2008 that the president no longer shares their \"be nice\" midwestern attitudes. Of course, this is also the state where Romney's campaign destroyed Newt Gingrich so effectively that it might seem odd His Mittness is suddenly doing a Jimmy Stewart impression. The Romney campaign poured so much vitriol on Newt in Iowa that it not only popped his campaign bubble, but also sent Gingrich into such a tailspin of anti-Romney rage that the former House speaker himself ran anti-Bain documentaries.</p> <h2>How</h2> <p>Mitt Romney is now shocked (shocked!) that people negatively campaign, distort the truth and smear opponents. Hence this ad. It is simple stuff, affecting a tone of po-faced disappointment.</p> <p>\"What does it say about a president's character when his campaign tries to use the tragedy of a woman's death for political gain,\" the ad begins. Of course, it then gets in to some distorting of its own, by implying the offending ad is an Obama campaign spot, when it is actually a Super Pac ad that has no official link to Obama (a defence Romney himself used in Iowa to distance himself from the anti-Gingrich attack machine).</p> <p>\"What does it say about a president's character when he had his campaign raise money for the ad and then stood by as his top campaign aides were caught lying about it,\" the ad informs us. In the meantime, it mixes a montage of media quotes like \"disgusting\" with picture of Obama looking smug and smiley. At one stage, the words \"scraping bottom\" appear, which to this naughty postcard-minded correspondent conjures up all sorts of strange images. But I digress. The repeating of the word \"character\" is key.</p> <p>\"Doesn't America deserve better than a president who will say or do anything to stay in power,\" the ad concludes. There are several things to say here. First, the notion that Mitt Romney can criticise a politician for being willing to \"say or do anything\" is staggering. This is a man who flip-flops so adroitly that if he wasn't campaigning for president, he would have been at the London Olympics winning gymnastics gold.</p> <p>Second, the ad has a point. The offending Obama spot was a horribly underhand piece of work, and in truth, the Obama campaign has always been dirty and ruthless (just ask Hillary and Bill Clinton, successfully tarred as racists in 2008). But Romney and the Republicans long ago lost their right to complain about it. Romney represents a movement that all too often tags Obama as a socialist. Or might-be Muslim. Or Kenyan. Or that believes his administration has been penetrated by sinister agents of the Muslim Brotherhood (courtesy Michele Bachmann!). </p> <p>In short, in modern American politics and the era of unlimited campaign money, neither side has the right to play the wounded party anymore. As is often said, politics ain't beanbag. Everyone knows this. Obama and Romney both play dirty. It just makes whining (from either side) look pathetic and hypocritical.</p> <p>But the really sad thing? In this brave new, cash-rich and morality-free world sponsored by Citizens United, no matter who wins the election in November, American politics has on some level already lost.</p>",
  "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Politics/2012/Aug-11/184266-michel-samahas-case-referred-to-military-tribunal-over-terror-plot.ashx\" title=\"\">arrest and indictment</a> of Lebanon's former information minister, Michel Samaha, on suspicion of plotting to assassinate political and religious figures in co-ordination with Syria's security bureau chief has sent shockwaves through the domestic political scene.</p> <p>It is difficult to overemphasise the significance of Samaha's case, because the former minister is one of the most <a href=\"http://english.alarabiya.net/views/2012/08/11/231614.html\" title=\"\">enthusiastic cheerleaders</a> for the regime of Syria's President Bashar al-Assad.</p> <p>Lebanon is intricately linked to Syria. Pre-existing divisions in Lebanese politics between pro- and anti-Assad politicians have crystallised as the Syrian uprising has progressed, <a href=\"http://www.unmultimedia.org/photo/detail.jsp?id=490/490022&amp;key=48&amp;query=*&amp;lang=en&amp;sf=\" title=\"\">to the chagrin of the international community</a> and the obvious detriment of <a href=\"http://www.naharnet.com/stories/en/46073\" title=\"\">civilians in border areas</a>.</p> <p>So when a prominent and outspoken Assad sympathiser gets arrested on terrorism charges, it is not merely a security issue. Samaha belongs to the 8 March bloc largely supportive of the Syrian president. It is made up of several parties, the most prominent of which is Hezbollah.</p> <p>Samaha's arrest was carried out by the Internal Security Forces (ISF), a department largely accepted to be under the influence of Sunni political groups. Its head, Ashraf Rifi, has very close links to Saudi Arabia.</p> <p>A pro-Assad politician allied to Shia Hezbollah arrested by a Sunni, anti-Assad police brigade? Things like this don't end well in Lebanon. The last time something as potentially disruptive to the country's delicate sectarian balance occurred, in May 2008, <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20080517143623/http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2008/05/12/49725.html\" title=\"\">street battles raged for several days</a>. Dozens were killed.</p> <p>This time around, as Lebanon braced itself for the violent fallout of Samaha's arrest, something strange happened: nothing. The expected backlash from fellow Assad supporters in Lebanon (and there are many) never came.</p> <p>The reasons behind Hezbollah's restraint are straightforward, if a little unexpected. The party is not, as is commonly supposed, strategically allied to Assad (even if it may be so politically). For all the gossip that Hezbollah fighters are <a href=\"http://blogs.cfr.org/abrams/2012/05/16/hezbollah-fighters-in-syria/\" title=\"\">operating alongside pro-government gangs</a> in Syria, its military arm has steadfastly refused to get drawn into conflicts within Lebanon concerning the Syria crisis.</p> <p>When pro- and anti-Assad gangs clashed in Beirut and Tripoli in May, Hezbollah played <a href=\"http://english.al-akhbar.com/content/beirut-battle-day-after-future%E2%80%99s-victory\" title=\"\">an uncharacteristic peacekeeping role</a> by facilitating the evacuation of a besieged militia leader.</p> <p>Hezbollah admits to <a href=\"http://www.rt.com/news/assange-hezbollah-nasrallah-syria-263/\" title=\"\">communicating with the Syrian opposition</a>. The party even <a href=\"http://www.naharnet.com/stories/en/49707\" title=\"\">distanced itself</a> from remarks made with <a href=\"http://www.nowlebanon.com/NewsArchiveDetails.aspx?ID=426538\" title=\"\">characteristic bombast</a> by its politburo chief, Mohammad Raad, who sprung to Samaha's defence and accused the ISF of being politically motivated. These are hardly the actions of a party that will live or die by Assad's side.</p> <p>Hezbollah may prefer his regime to the alternatives but it gets directives and funding from Iran, not Syria. For sure, the fall of a friendly regime would inconvenience Hezbollah. But an inconvenience is not worth tearing Lebanon apart for, and Hezbollah seems to understand this.</p> <p>In addition, Hezbollah, perhaps for the first time in its history, finds itself in a position of virtually unchallenged influence in Lebanon. It belongs to the government. It enjoys an arsenal and fighting force far outstripping that of the state. There is a general election coming in 2013 and Hezbollah is quite happy with the makeup of the country as it is.</p> <p>Syria called the shots in Lebanon for more than three decades before its armed presence there was <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4484325.stm\" title=\"\">ended in 2005</a>. It has been accused of continuing to perform assassinations in Lebanon and, if the charges against Samaha prove correct, it has been <a href=\"http://english.al-akhbar.com/content/former-lebanese-mp-michel-samaha-arrested\" title=\"\">caught doing so</a>. If Samaha is found guilty, Assad will be directly implicated. This, clearly, is a red line that not even Hezbollah is willing to see flouted.</p> <p>If the government in Damascus is proved to have been trying to export Syria's crisis to Lebanon, it will be seen as yet another miscalculation by a regime that is alienating even its staunchest traditional partisans.</p> <p>Meanwhile, a Lebanese government composed almost exclusively of Assad sympathisers seems curiously content to see one of his biggest supporters go hang.</p>",
  "<p>Mitt Romney's presidential campaign has been placed on the defensive over proposals by his running mate Paul Ryan to reshape Medicare, the popular healthcare programme for over-65s that has become a hot election issue.</p> <p>The Democrats stepped up their campaign on an argument they think is a winner, sending spokesmen out to claim Ryan's plan to reform the system would spell the end of Medicare, and distributing 100,000 bumper stickers that read: \"Save Medicare, Vote Democrat\".</p> <p>Since the announcement of Ryan as Romney's vice-presidential pick, the Republican challenger has faced persistent questioning over where he stands. The Romney team has been left vulnerable, in part because it has been sending out mixed messages. </p> <p>Romney, in a rare press conference on Monday night in Florida, repeatedly refused to say whether he backed Ryan's Medicare reform plan. Some of advisers have gone on television to say publicly that he wholly and enthusiastically endorsed Ryan's budget proposals and would, if president, have signed it. Others have sought to distance him from it, saying Romney was running on his own plan.</p> <p>At the Miami press conference, Romney insisted there was no contradiction. \"I'm sure there are places that my budget is different than his, but we're on the same page,\" Romney said. \"My plan for Medicare is very similar to his plan for Medicare.\"</p> <p>Barack Obama's senior campaign adviser, David Axelrod, returned to the television studios on Tuesday to say that election of the Romney-Ryan ticket would lead to a death spiral for Medicare.</p> <p>The issue is likely to dominate Ryan's visit at the weekend to Florida, a swing state in which seniors make up a large part of the population and where the Republican convention is to be held just over a week later.</p> <p>Republicans are hoping that the convention in Tampa will energise the campaign and silence anonymous critics within the party. On Tuesday, <a href=\" http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/79697.html#ixzz23XdZUUc7\">Politico published a lengthy piece</a>, quoting unnamed party activists who said there was concern amongst GOP operatives in Washington about the Ryan pick, and in particular the Medicare issue. \"This could be the defining moment of the campaign. If they win the battle to define Medicare, then I believe Romney wins the presidency. If they lose it, then they lose big in the fall,\" said one unnamed \"strategist\" quoted by Politico.</p> <p>On Tuesday, the Republicans announced that Chris Christie, the charismatic New Jersey governor, who was touted as a possible vice-presidential candidate, is to be given a prominent role, making the keynote address. The Florida senator, Marco Rubio, who Romney confirmed had been on his vice-presidential shortlist, is also being given a prominent slot, introducing Romney when he makes his speech accepting the party nomination as Republican presidential candidate.</p> <p>The keynote address at the Democratic convention will be given by former president Bill Clinton.</p> <p>Ryan is campaigning Tuesday in Nevada where a pro-Obama Super Pac funded mainly by unions is sponsoring an advertising campaign saying seniors are at risk from the Romney-Ryan ticket. Ryan is scheduled for a fundraising event at a casino complex owned by Sheldon Adelson, one of the big contributors to the Republican party.</p> <p>Adelson is a divisive figure: <a href=\"www.nytimes.com/2012/08/14/us/politics/sheldon-adelsons-dealings-in-china-are-under-investigation.html\">the New York Times reported Tuesday</a> that a Chinese businessman linked to Adelson is the focus of a federal investigation into potential bribery.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 15 August 2012. The original referred to Marco Rubio as the Florida governor, rather than senator. This has been corrected.</p>",
  "<p>Amid the passing of the London Olympics (and the well-earned passing out of many of the athletes), one piece of interesting economic data may have escaped you.

The Ryan Plan is so damaging to social programs benefiting our poorest and most vulnerable citizens that it prompted the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops to publicly blast the devout Catholic for not just tearing holes in the nation's safety but for his \"shredding of the nation's moral obligations.\"<br>These are not the actions of a man with an abiding love and respect for food.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>James Surowiecki, <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2012/08/paul-ryans-budget-games.html\">the New Yorker</a></strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Ryan is not a pragmatist; he is an ideologue. His budget proposals are driven not by the demands of America's current fiscal situation, but rather by deeply held convictions about the need to limit government power. There's absolutely nothing wrong with this \u2013 if you believe that \"big\" government destroys personal initiative and strangles the economy, and that the current tax system is morally offensive and economically destructive, then you need to not just tinker with the system, but to remake it. What's wrong is that, so far, Ryan hasn't been honest about the fact that this is what he wants to do \u2013 probably because most voters, including most Republicans, don't actually want to dramatically shrink the government. Perhaps this campaign will change that. But I'm not holding my breath.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Josh Trevino, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/11/mitt-romney-acquires-risky-asset-paul-ryan-vp?newsfeed=true\">the Guardian</a></strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Every re-election effort is a referendum on the incumbent, but hitherto, the only incumbent in play was Barack Obama. Now, there's another: Paul Ryan and the Republican House. Democrats who had to defend the lackluster governance of the Obama years are now given the superb gift of a man who arguably shares blame for them. The contention that Paul Ryan is as responsible for the failures of the Obama administration as Obama himself is deeply preposterous, of course \u2013 but that doesn't mean the Democratic campaign won't make it. And given the outcomes of past confrontations between this Congress and this White House, there's a good chance it will work.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Mark Mcdonald, <a href=\"http://rendezvous.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/12/for-asia-so-far-paul-ryan-remains-out-of-focus/\">International Herald Tribune</a></strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Mr Ryan's ideas on the new \"pivot\" of US military assets toward the Asia-Pacific; regional disputes in the South China Sea; an unstable Pakistan; a nuclear North Korea under a new dictator; recent reforms in Myanmar; arms sales to Taiwan; newly adopted military relationships, and other issues in Asia have yet to be spelled out in detail.</p> <p>But Mr Ryan, 42, who has proposed new increases in US defense spending, has spoken forcefully about his vision of American exceptionalism and a continued need for US global leadership, which he connects directly to the country's economic prosperity.</p> <h2>Tuesday, August 14</h2> </blockquote> <p><strong>William Voegeli, <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/313904/ryanism-big-picture-william-voegeli\">National Review Online</a></strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Amid all this arcana, we must not lose sight of two main functions of Ryanism, now the core of Republicanism after being endorsed by the GOP's congressional caucus and presidential nominee. First, Ryanism reminds the American people that a long-term trend is not the same thing as a law of nature. That the welfare state always has grown does not mean it always must grow. Indeed, a well-designed and well-administered welfare state can, in a welcome sense, grow and shrink at the same time. Second, Ryanism challenges the Democrats to finally come clean, 80 years after launching the New Deal, about the cost and consequences of their ambitions.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Jonathan P Hicks, <a href=\"http://www.bet.com/news/features/vote-2012/news/politics/2012/08/13/commentary-paul-ryan-and-the-americans-on-the-margins.html\">BET</a></strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Ryan's selection might excite President Obama's campaign by highlighting the congressman as the bogeyman and champion of repressive policies. But for those people who live far from the world of Romney's wealth or, for that matter, the income or health care coverage of members of congress like Ryan, this is a disturbing, disappointing choice. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Ezra Klein, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/08/11/paul-ryan-isnt-a-deficit-hawk-hes-a-conservative-reformer/\">the Washington Post</a></strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The truth is that the Ryan budget's largest long-term savings don't come from Medicaid or Medicare or Social Security, or even Medicaid and Medicare and Social Security put together. They come from everything else. Ryan says that under his budget, everything the federal government does that is not Medicare, Medicaid or Social Security will be cut to less than 3.75 percent of GDP by 2050. That means defense, infrastructure, education, food safety, energy research, national parks, civil service, the FBI \u2013 all of it. Right now, that category of spending is 12.5 percent of GDP. </p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Giles Fraser, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/13/paul-ryan-ayn-rand-romney\">the Guardian</a></strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>But here's the political problem for Ryan. Many were queasy when George Bush cheesily described Jesus as his favourite philosopher, but at least he knew his market. In contrast, few books can be as hostile to the Christian faith as Atlas Shrugged. For Rand, the good Samaritan was not simply a chump: he was in fact doing something wicked. We are saved only by selfishness. So how can an American politician, who has described himself as a \"staunch Catholic\" and in what is supposed to be an electorate dominated by Christian values, side with one who so thoroughly rejected all the teachings of Jesus?</p> </blockquote>",

And not that he has ruined the economy; it's more accurate to say that he and the central bankers saved the world. Furthermore, he isn't a socialist or a tyrant bent on destroying America, as various demagogues \u2013 including a number of washed-out Republican presidential hopefuls \u2013 like to tell the teeming mouth-breathers. And, no, he's not a Muslim.</p> <p>Not that there's anything wrong with that.</p> <p>But President Obama is, come to discover \u2013 and forgive the tautology \u2013 a cynical politician. Not for selling out environmental interests for the sake of salvaging jobs, although, well \u2026 And not for soft-pedaling regulation and legal scrutiny of the Wall Street pigs who nearly destroyed us, to the ongoing rage of the grungy 99%. And not even for remaining virtually mute about the horrifying spate of gun violence, lest he antagonize undecided gun nuts.</p> <p>Let's just ascribe that behavior to presidential pragmatism. In the ebb and flow of politics, you can't always get what you want. Obama does, after all, face a Tea Party hostage situation in Congress, where the GOP leadership will pass neither a camera emplacement nor a law.</p> <p>Nonetheless, be not too quick to see the president of the United States as a mere hapless victim of vicious partisan politics. He is also a perpetrator.</p> <p>For the past 10 days, the president's Super Pac \u2013 Priorities USA Action \u2013 has been running a Swiftboat attack on Republican Mitt Romney so grotesque, so dishonest, so debased, as to force you to wonder who this Obama guy is, and whether he has been that guy all along. The <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2012/08/10/star_of_obama_super_pacs_cancer_ad_says_bain_offered_him_a_buyout.html\">ad features a former steel worker named Joe Soptic</a>, recounting the death of his wife from cancer, after Soptic lost his health insurance when Romney's Bain Capital shut down the steel mill in 2001.</p> <p>\"I don't think Mitt Romney understands what he's done to peoples' lives,\" Soptic says.</p> <p>What Soptic doesn't say, and what the ad leaves out, is that: a) Romney had left Bain Capital for the Salt Lake City Olympics when the plant was shut down; b) Soptic lost his health insurance, but his wife remained covered at her own job; c) she was not diagnosed with cancer till five years later; d) during which interim she held subsequent jobs and other insurance coverage.</p> <p>Yet, the message is unmistakable: Mitt Romney has blood on his hands.</p> <p>This is repulsive. The <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/politico44/2012/08/team-obama-says-they-dont-story-of-man-who-stars-of-131462.html\">Obama campaign at first claimed</a> to know nothing about Joe Soptic; indeed, Super Pacs \u2013 awash in donations from labor unions, corporations, and the wealthy \u2013 are statutorily prohibited from coordinating with candidates. But nobody believes that firewall exists. And the <a href=\"http://newmediajournal.us/indx.php/item/6402\">campaign was caught in its transparent lie</a>, when someone remembered a Obama 2012 conference call in which Soptic and his sad tale were trotted out by the campaign for the assembled press.</p> <p>Back in 2004, when a political action committee favoring George W Bush unleashed scurrilous ads accusing Democratic candidate John Kerry of cowardice and treason for the very Vietnam episodes that had gotten him decorated for bravery, Democrats howled with outrage at the smear by Swifboat Veterans for Truth. They howled when George HW Bush trotted out the infamous, race-baiting \"Willie Horton\" ad against Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis. They howled when John McCain tried to link Senator Barack Obama with domestic terrorist William Ayres.</p> <p>And well that they should have. Such tactics are beyond obscene. They are depraved.</p> <p>And so is obliterating inconvenient facts to accuse the presumptive Republican nominee of homicidal neglect.</p> <p>Once again, in theory, what the Priorities USA Action Super Pac does is independent of the campaign, although the funding entity was founded by the president's closest associates from previous campaigns. But never mind that. In the past 10 days, the Obama 2012 campaign itself has had every opportunity to condemn the tactics, to reject the slanderous implication, to entirely disavow the sorry episode and demand that the ad be pulled. Instead, from top to bottom, the <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/243271-axelrod-priorities-ad-doesnt-blame-romney-for-womans-death\">campaign has offered mealy-mouthed denials</a>. Likewise, the Democratic National Committee and a legion of partisan capos with long spears and short memories. Suddenly, swiftboating suits them just fine.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the patron saint of hope and change has said not a word. It would have been so easy:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I am Barack Obama and I emphatically disapprove this message.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>But, nope, mum's the word. And the silence speaks volumes.</p> <p>Look, choose the candidates you prefer. There are manifest differences between them. But do yourself a favor. Dispense with the hero worship. Believing a politician transcends politics is to guarantee disappointment. Depravity turns out to be an equal opportunity employer.</p> <p>\u2022 Editor's note: this article originally stated in error that Soptic's steel mill closed in 1992; this was amended to 2001 (after Romney had left Bain Capital) at 11.40am (ET) on 14 August 2012</p>",
  "<p>A former intelligence chief has been appointed as Israel's new minister for homeland security, as speculation about a military strike targeting Iran's nuclear programme intensifies.</p> <p>Avi Dichter, 59, who headed Israel's internal security agency, Shin Bet, from 2000-05, will be confirmed in the new post at a special parliamentary session this week. Dichter has previously indicated a cautious approach to military action against Iran. In February, he said Israel should not act unilaterally: \"Israel is not a superpower. We cannot lead the world offensive against Iran \u2026 We need to prepare, just in case nobody plans to do anything, but to lead it will be a total mistake.\"</p> <p>Two months ago, he said he was glad the former Mossad chief Meir Dagan had spoken out against a military strike.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2012/aug/14/israeli-speculation-iran-strike\" title=\"\">Febrile speculation</a> over whether the prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, and defence minister, Ehud Barak, are close to ordering military action in the coming weeks has dominated the Israeli media in recent days. In an article on Friday in Israel's biggest-selling daily, Yedioth Ahronoth, commentators Nahum Barnea and Shimon Shiffer wrote: \"Insofar as it depends on Binyamin Netanyahu and Ehud Barak, an Israeli military strike on the nuclear facilities in Iran will take place in the autumn before the US elections in November.\"</p> <p>Barnea later wrote that he and Shiffer had since been \"bombarded with phone calls from people who asked if it was time to hide in the bomb shelters\".</p> <p>In a long interview in <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/\" title=\"\">Haaretz</a>, also on Friday, an anonymous figure dubbed the \"decision maker\" \u2013 widely believed to be Barak \u2013 said Israel could not \"place the responsibility for its security and future in the hands of even its best and most loyal friend\", meaning the United States.</p> <p>Despite the speculation, there are questions about Netanyahu's willingness to risk a war in the face of opposition by most of Israel's current and former military and intelligence establishments. Some believe Netanyahu and Barak are playing a dangerous game of bluff to force the US to act; others say the risk-averse prime minister will balk at the last minute.</p> <p>Netanyahu told cabinet colleagues on Sunday that Israel had been \"investing billions in home-front defence\" in anticipation of a possible war, including anti-missile systems, warning systems, exercises in preparedness, structural reinforcement of buildings, and provision of shelters.</p> <p>He and other ministers were holding fortnightly meetings \"to monitor the necessary steps to upgrade home front defence\".</p> <p>According to the Israeli Defence Forces, more than 60,000 missiles are currently aimed at Israel and could be deployed in the event of an attack on Iran. Brigadier General Itay Baron told a parliamentary committee in May that Hezbollah in Lebanon had 60,000 rockets and missiles, and a further 3,500 could be deployed by Syria, and Hamas from Gaza. Iran had an arsenal of 450 missiles capable of reaching Israel, he added. Other security officials have put the estimated figure as high as 200,000.</p> <p>However, Barak has previously suggested the number of Israeli casualties is unlikely to exceed 500. \"There is no way to prevent some damage,\" he said last November. \"It will not be pleasant. There is no scenario for 50,000 dead, or 5,000 killed \u2013 and if everyone stays in their homes, maybe not even 500 dead.\"</p> <p>On Sunday, Israel began a week-long trial of an SMS missile warning system for civilians. But 40% of the population has yet to be issued with gas masks, and about a quarter of civilians do not have easy access to a bomb shelter. A plan to evacuate thousands of civilians from northern cities, within reach of missiles fired from Lebanon, is reportedly being considered.</p> <p>Dichter's appointment comes after several candidates apparently turned down the job. Dichter was director of Shin Bet during the second intifada, or Palestinian uprising, and served in the same army unit as Netanyahu and Barak. He replaces Matan Vilnai, who has been appointed ambassador to China.</p>",
  "<p>Paul Ryan, the Republicans' new vice-presidential contender, is no fan of the National Health Service model, believing that the kind of \"socialised healthcare\" we have Britain jeopardises future tax cuts.</p> <p>In an attempt to fight off President Obama's healthcare policies in the US, he <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123207075026188601.html\" title=\"\">co-authored a Wall Street Journal</a> in which he said:</p> <blockquote> \"Once a large number of citizens get their health care from the state, it dramatically alters their attachment to government. Every time a tax cut is proposed, the guardians of the new medical-welfare state will argue that tax cuts would come at the expense of health care.\" </blockquote> <p>Ryan made the comments in 2009, but since Mitt Romney chose him as his running mate on Saturday, the Wisconsin congressman's past criticisms of the NHS have taken on more significance.</p> <p>What do you make of US Republicans taking a pop at the NHS? Do they have a point about free healthcare being a threat to democratic capitalism? Or do you resent their trying to making political capital out of the way Britain runs its health services? What would you tell Paul Ryan about the NHS if you met him?</p>",
  "<p>It didn't take long for <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/12/paul-ryan-hailed-donations-romney\" title=\"\">Mitt Romney's Republican running-mate, Paul Ryan</a>, to make the kind of impact on us foreigners which will delight his admirers and confirm the bookies' hunch that Barack Obama may well win his second term in November despite an ailing US economy. Just two days on the job and some bright spark has just unearthed Ryan's attack on the NHS.</p> <p>It confirms the impression I got from reading the Fleet St Tory press on Sunday after Romney's introduction of him as \"the next president of the United States\" (whoops). \"Who says Romney is always risk-averse, eh?\" and, \"this will set the contest alight\". It sounded like whistling in the dark to keep conservative spirits up, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/oliver-burkemans-blog/2012/aug/13/conservative-elation-mitt-romney-pick-paul-ryan\" title=\"\">knowing that the choice may well prove a Palin-esque mistake</a>.</p> <p>We can shrug and say that Congressman Ryan doesn't know much about the NHS, either its strengths or weaknesses, so we needn't waste much time on his views. That's true as far as it goes. Very bright (so we keep being told) and charismatic (Mitt needs help in that department), Ryan is an ideologue who would look at a taxpayer-funded healthcare system and condemn it out of hand.</p> <p>That's what he did in the Wall St Journal (proprietor: R Murdoch) in 2009 when he warned that the Obama health plan would put the US on \"a glide path towards European-style socialism\" in which voters would become dependent on government, reluctant to embrace spending cuts which might hit their healthcare.</p> <p>\"We need only look to Great Britain and elsewhere to see the effects of socialised healthcare on the broader economy. Once a large number of citizens get their heathcare from the State (it's always with a capital 'S' among the Ryan crowd), it dramatically alters their attachment to government,\" he wrote.</p> <p>OK, we can follow that and agree with it \u2013 or not.</p> <p>What we do know is that the UK still spends less than 10% of its GDP on healthcare, as do most advanced EU healthcare systems, more or less, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_care_in_the_United_States\" title=\"\">while the US spends at least 15%, and probably nearer 17%</a>, a US health executive (private sector) told me recently.</p> <p>Which system its both fairer and more efficient in terms of health outcomes? We all know the answer. Despite the brilliance of its hi-tech medicine and its restless quest for innovation, it's not the US.</p> <p>That's what the great battle over Obama healthcare was all about: to create a system underpinned by compulsory insurance \u2013 nearly 50 million Americans, one in six, are uninsured \u2013 greater efficiency as well as fairness and bear down on costs which benefit doctors, insurance firms and pharmaceuticals, but not US business overall. Health costs are a weighty burden on both employers and staff, the largest single cause of personal bankruptcy.</p> <p>We know all this, don't we? That's where critics of Andrew Lansley's marketisation plan for the NHS \u2013 a bit more competition between the NHS, private and voluntary providers - often get it wrong.</p> <p>Lansley knows what a mess the US system is and doesn't want to copy it. No one does and even pro-market campaigners like <a href=\"http://www.reform.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Reform</a> now cite the low-cost health care innovations being pioneered in places like Mexico and Brazil as examples we might usefully explore.</p> <p>For all his vaunted cleverness I doubt if Paul Ryan knows much about this. Americans are surprisingly insular in many ways, that's why they call their local baseball competition the World Series (although the Toronto Blue Jays are allowed to play). Example? Two from yesterday's FT will do. Columnist Gillian Tett explained that many major American corporations earn most revenue abroad now - 90% of sales are overseas even for Tupperware now \u2013 which helps in a recession, but is bad for US politics. Most CEOs can no longer be bothered with it.</p> <p>And on the same page Kishmore Mahbubani, an academic policy analyst in Singapore, patiently explained why the New York state regulator, Benjamin Lawsky, was wrong to beat up on <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/08/14/us-standardcharted-probe-idUSBRE87C04O20120814\" title=\"\">Standard Chartered Bank the way he did</a>. Right or wrong (probably wrong?) he acted unilaterally (probably for local political reasons) in a world where <em>co-ordinated</em> action between global bank regulators is more vital than ever. It wouldn't occur to Benny that Asian regulators might be unimpressed \u2013 and that their views now count for a lot, his for less.</p> <p>But Paul Ryan is a familiar type in so many ways. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Ryan\" title=\"\">Check out his CV here</a>. Being born in heartland Wisconsin doesn't automatically make him insular. The region's industries have bled badly during globalisation. But he's also a professional politician of the kind conservatives usually like to deplore \u2013 Barack Obama didn't have much of a CV before politics either.</p> <p>Ryan's father died young of heart trouble (there's a family history) which has made him a fitness fanatic, something American health policymakers need to take more seriously than most. He worked his way through college, but also used his late father's state benefits to help out. There ought to be an irony check here, but \u2013 as Obama is already pointing out - Ryan advocates a small state solution while still voting for expensive government programmes. We know the type.</p> <p>Professional politician? Yes, After college in Ohio, where he first encountered Hayek, Friedman, Von Mises and the intoxicating works of Ayn Rand (Alan Greenspan, who presided over the great boom and bust at the Federal Reserve was also a Rand fan), Ryan went straight to work for Wisconsin senator Bob Kasten at just 22.</p> <p>When Kasten lost his seat the same year (1992) Ryan stayed on in Washington \u2013 the wicked capital to Tea Party types \u2013 so he's not the \"Washington outsider\" they claim he is. Within six years \u2013 at 28 \u2013 he was back home (1997) and elected to Congress. He will face his eighth re-election (the law allows it) while running for Veep this autumn. Though he always did part-time jobs, there's a sniff of privilege in that CV, the long-established Ryan family construction business and some political jobs which may have helped him up the ladder. Meritocracy and nepotism are close cousins, as we know.</p> <p>As you've probably read in the past two days Ryan is now chairman of the House of Representatives budget committee, author of the Ryan Plan to shrink the federal government by such devices as a cap on healthcare spending (ironically Medicare for the elderly, Medicaid for the poor, are government programmes that outspend the NHS), a 10% cut in government jobs and a simplified income tax system, 10% and 25% bands to replace the current six.</p> <p>That's a $6tn cut in federal spending over 10 years and would trim everything from roads and airports to student loans, environmental protection and food stamps for the poor \u2013 everything except social security (which is basically benefits and pensions) and defence. Ryan's proposed \"block grant\" system of payment to states running Medicaid would on some estimates cut the numbers entitled to it from 41 million to 27 million.</p> <p>It has prompted the wits to say that Romney, who has flip-flopped on so many issues in his quest for the presidency, has now outsourced his brain. Whatever the candidate says to reassure Middle America that he's not as radical as Ryan, the running mate is the more dynamic figure, the man who brought vast cheering crowds of loyalists out to cheer an astonished Romney in Waukesha, Wisconsin, yesterday.</p> <p>Plenty of Americans see government as the enemy \u2013 and only this year big money funded <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/07/after-wisconsin-recall-el_n_1579319.html\" title=\"\">a successful referendum result</a> in Wisconsin to endorse the governor's plans to curb trade union rights, this in a state once famous for progressive welfare reform. There was a <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global/wisconsin-shooting\" title=\"\">mass shooting at a Sikh temple</a> there only last week. Many people are under pressure and come up with some crazy solutions.</p> <p>One of the more interesting articles on Ryan that I have read claims that he is more of a principled conviction politician than many critics \u2013 or this article \u2013 might suggest.</p> <p>Jacob Weisberg, chairman of the Slate website, has been telling his readers that Ryan's arrival on the ticket will force Americans to consider basic issues they might otherwise be tempted to duck.</p> <p>Thus he would pay for some of his promised tax cuts \u2013 Americans love tax cuts, even when it leads straight to added debts for their children - by eliminating tax deductions. He doesn't say which ones, but that is a recipe for getting more taxes from the rich.</p> <p>Other commentators say that Ryan's arrival allows Obama to switch the election's spotlight from his record, patchy in hard Bush-created times, to what a Romney-Ryan administration might do. Scary stuff.</p> <p>Weisberg's sombre conclusion is that Ryan knows about the hard choices ahead for the US as it seeks to improve its performance in the face of the Chinese ascendancy, that he has a coherent policy which finally starts to make have-it-both-ways conservatives honest as the Democrats are not yet in the quest to make government more affordably efficient.</p> <p>Brutal honesty in election year is a bold option. For that reason Ryan on the ticket probably means a Republican defeat in November. Rupert Murdoch, who likes winners, is backing him. But, as we know, Rupe is fast losing his grip. David Cameron should watch from a safe distance and learn from the Romney-Ryan train crash.</p>",

But already, analysts says, some politicians are using the divisive rhetoric of \"us against them\" on the campaign trail.</p> <p>\"[Political] mobilisation is still \u2026 being done around individuals and these individuals are talking to their ethnic base first,\" said Ndung'u Wainaina, executive director of the <a href=\"http://www.icpcafrica.org/\" title=\"\">International Centre for Policy and Conflict</a>.</p> <p>In July Kenya's <a href=\"http://www.cohesion.or.ke/\" title=\"\">National Cohesion and Integration Commission</a>, brought a case against three Kikuyu musicians, charging them with inciting violence against people of the Luo tribe in political songs.

  "<p>In the past few days, the Israeli public has been hit by a blizzard of speculative articles suggesting a military strike against Iran's nuclear sites is imminent.</p> <p>The talk is now of a timetable of weeks, rather than months and some observers believe that Israel will act in the runup to the US presidential election \u2013 at a time when it could be difficult and damaging for President Obama to withhold his backing in the face of a hawkish and vehemently pro-Israel opponent, Mitt Romney, who has already indicated his support for unilateral action by the Jewish state.</p> <p>On Tuesday, an article in Ma'ariv suggested that Netanyahu and Barak have set a deadline of 25 September for Obama to clearly state that the US itself will take military action. The date is the opening of the UN general assembly in New York, and also the eve of Yom Kippur, one of the most significant dates in the Jewish calendar.</p> <p>The implication is that, in the absence of a public declaration, Israel will press on with its own plans to strike at the Iranian nuclear programme.</p> <p>But it was two articles last Friday that kicked off the current storm. Writing in Israel's biggest-selling daily, Yedioth Ahronoth, Nahum Barnea and Simon Shiffer, both respected commentators, said: \"Insofar as it depends on Binyamin Netanyahu and Ehud Barak, an Israeli military strike on the nuclear facilities in Iran will take place in these coming autumn months, before the US elections in November.\"</p> <p>But, it pointed out: \"There is not a single senior official in the establishment \u2013 neither among the [Israeli Defence Forces] top brass nor in the security branches, or even the president \u2013 who supports an Israeli strike at the moment.\"</p> <p>Nevertheless, Netanyahu and Barak are determined, according to the authors. Despite US assurances that Obama is committed to stopping the Iranian nuclear programme, \"Netanyahu assessed that this was empty talk. That Obama will not take action. Barak was less confrontational, but his conclusion was similar. He said that Israel could not entrust its security in the hands of a foreign state&#xa0;\u2026 The US can live with a nuclear Iran. Israel cannot.\"</p> <p>On Monday morning, Barnea reported that he and Shiffer had been \"bombarded with phone calls from people who asked if it was time to hide in the bomb shelters\" over the weekend.</p> <p>Barak is also widely assumed to be the \"decision maker\", the anonymous key figure whose views were spread over two pages of <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/magazine/a-grave-warning-on-iran-from-the-decision-maker.premium-1.457158\" title=\"\">Haaretz's weekend magazine</a> on Friday. This thinly disguised figure said time was running out to act against the Iranian nuclear programme, and the \"immunity zone\" - the point when key components of the programme are beyond reach in deep bunkers - was approaching.</p> <p>According to the decision maker: \"As the Iranians continue to fortify their nuclear sites and disperse them and accumulate uranium, the moment is approaching when Israel will not be able to do anything. For the Americans, the Iranians are not yet approaching the immunity zone \u2013 because the Americans have much larger bombers and bombs, and the ability to repeat the operation a whole number of times. But for us, Iran could soon enter the immunity zone. And when that happens, it means putting a matter that is vital to our survival in the hands of the United States. Israel cannot allow this to happen. It cannot place the responsibility for its security and future in the hands of even its best and most loyal friend.\"</p> <p>Added into the mix was a much-quoted comment, made by Mossad chief Ehraim Halevy, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/02/world/middleeast/in-israel-panetta-warns-iran-on-nuclear-program.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all\" title=\"\">to the New York Times</a> the week before, in which he said: \"If I was an Iranian, I would be very fearful of the next 12 weeks.\"</p> <p>It's possible that the single short quote was taken from a long, measured interview, but it should be assumed that Halevy understood that his words would have impact.</p> <p>He was swiftly followed by another former intelligence chief, Aharon Zeevi Farkash, former head of military intelligence in the IDF, <a href=\"http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/158570%C2%A3.UCj9jY4uZSU\" title=\"\">who said</a>: \"It seems to me that [an Israeli attack] could come in the near future,\" that is, weeks or a couple of months.\"</p> <p>Despite the rising decibels, a decision by Netanyahu and Barak to take Israel into a war against the advice of current and former military and intelligence bigwigs, and against the opposition of most of the cabinet, would be an enormous political risk, even leaving aside the military, security and diplomatic consequences</p> <p>Former prime minister Ehud Olmert was the latest public figure to throw in his cautionary tuppence-worth, in a speech on Sunday. He said: \"There is no reason whatsoever for Israel to act in the near future, not in the coming weeks and not in the coming months&#xa0;\u2026 We do not have to be hysterical. We have to calm down&#xa0;\u2026 I am part of the circle that believes that Israel can not allow Iran to obtain nuclear weapons. The question is, how do we proceed with this?&#xa0;\u2026 This process must be made in full compliance with the international community.\"</p> <p>What about the Israeli public? According to an opinion poll in Ma'ariv last Friday, 41% believe sanctions and diplomacy alone will not stop the Iranians developing a nuclear bomb, 22% retained their faith in sanctions and diplomacy and 37% didn't know.</p> <p>A subsequent series of questions showed that most people hope for US involvement in military action, and believe it will be forthcoming.</p> <p>But if it comes to \"the latest possible date that Israel can seriously harm the Iranian nuclear programme on its own\", 35% said Israel should go it alone, 39% said leave it to the US and international community, and 26% said they didn't know.</p> <p>Four out of 10 said they trusted the judgment of Netanyahu and Barak on this issue, compared with 27% who answered in the negative.</p> <p>There are still those who believe Netanyahu and Barak are playing a dangerous game of bluff aimed at forcing America's hand. But, for now, those who believe Israel is heading towards war are speaking with louder voices.</p>",
  "<p>Paul Ryan, Mitt Romney\u2019s vice-presidential running mate, sold stock in US banks on the same day he attended a confidential meeting where top level officials disclosed the sector was heading for a deep crisis.</p> <p>The congressman on Monday denied profiting from information gleaned from the meeting on 18 September 2008 when Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke, then treasury secretary Hank Paulson and others outlined their fears for the banking sector. His office said he had no control over the trades.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/09/paul-ryan-donald-trump-republican-national-convention-chair\">Paul Ryan offers to step down as GOP convention chair if Donald Trump asks</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"http://www.the-richmonder.com/2012/08/paul-ryan-traded-on-insider-information.html\">Public records show </a>that on the same day as the meeting, Ryan sold stock in troubled banks including Wachovia and Citigroup and bought shares in Goldman Sachs, Paulson\u2019s old employer and a bank that had been disclosed to be stronger than many of its rivals. The sale was not illegal at the time.</p> <p>Not long after the meeting, Wachovia\u2019s already troubled share price went into free fall. It plunged 39% on the afternoon of 26 September alone as investors worried the bank would collapse. It was eventually taken over by Wells Fargo for $15bn, a fraction of its former value. </p> <p>Citigroup\u2019s share price fell soon after the meeting. In October 2008 Citigroup was among the largest beneficiary of the troubled asset relief program (Tarp), the taxpayer-funded bailout of the banking sector.</p> <p>Ryan was a supporter of the Tarp bailout \u2013 a position that has put him at odds with the right wing of his party despite his otherwise conservative credentials. Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo are now among his largest financial supporters, <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/contrib.php?cycle=2012&amp;cid=N00004357&amp;type=I\">according to the Center for Responsive Politics</a>.</p> <p>The trades were highlighted at the weekend by <a href=\"http://www.the-richmonder.com/2012/08/paul-ryan-traded-on-insider-information.html\">the Richmonder</a>, a left-leaning political blog in Virginia. </p> <p>After the story was picked up by the media on Monday, the Romney campaign moved to deny it. <a href=\"http://2012.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/08/paul-ryan-insider-trading-rumor-quickly-debunked.php?ref=fpnewsfeed\">Talking Points Memo quoted Larry Gaffney</a>, an independent accountant for the partnership that handled the trades questioned by commentators, said the shares were not controlled by Ryan.</p> <p>\u201cTrades are done automatically based on an algorithm on a regular basis,\u201d said Gaffney, in a statement to TPM that was provided by the Romney campaign. \u201cIn addition, this index was held at the time within a partnership in which Rep. Ryan had and continues to have no trading authority.\u201d</p> <p>Until this year members of Congress were allowed to trade on price-sensitive information gathered at Washington meetings. Nor is Ryan alone in having done so. <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=7388130n/\">CBS\u2019s 60 Minutes </a>criticised Democrat Nancy Pelosi for buying into Visa\u2019s initial public offering as the House discussed credit card legislation.</p> <p>After the CBS documentary, pressure mounted for change. In April, Barack Obama signed legislation that bars members of Congress and other federal workers from profiting from non-public information learned on the job. As well as banning insider trading the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (Stock) Act requires members of Congress to post details of transactions exceeding $1,000.</p> <p>In April the Office of Congressional Ethics cleared Spencer Bachus, Republican chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, of allegations of insider dealing. Critics had charged he had taken advantage of insider information to trade shares on numerous occasions.</p> <p>Bachus was present at the meeting that Ryan attended with Bernanke and Paulson. The next day he traded \u201cshort\u201d options, betting on a decline in share prices in the financial services sector.</p> <p>Attendees at the meeting have said Bernanke and Paulson\u2019s warnings were met with stunned silence. \u201cWhen you listened to him describe it you gulped,\u201d Senator Charles Schumer <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/20/washington/19cnd-cong.html\">told the New York Times</a>.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was updated at 9.30pm ET on 13 August to reflect a denial of impropriety by on the part of Ryan.</p>"
