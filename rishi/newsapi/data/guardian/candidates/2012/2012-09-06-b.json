  "<p>Barack Obama is to make a pitch for a second four years in the White House on Thursday night, holding out the prospect of a bold, ambitious and experimental programme to halt American decline on a scale comparable to Franklin Roosevelt's 1930s New Deal.</p> <p>Obama, at the end of the Democratic convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, is to say the choice on 6 November will be the most important facing Americans for generations, between his own big government approach and the corporate-dominated, small government approach of Republican opponent Mitt Romney.</p> <p>\"When all is said and done \u2013 when you pick up that ballot to vote \u2013 you will face the clearest choice of any time in a generation,\" he said in excerpts released in advance of his speech.</p> <p>\"Over the next few years, big decisions will be made in Washington, on jobs and the economy; taxes and deficits; energy and education; war and peace \u2013 decisions that will have a huge impact on our lives and our children's lives for decades to come.\"</p> <p>The speech was the culmination of a three-day Democratic convention that had an energy largely missing from the Republican one last week. It was more diverse in terms of gender and ethnicity, its delegates more fired up, especially after<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/06/bill-clinton-endorsement-barack-obama\" title=\"Bill Clinton gives thumping endorsement to Barack Obama\"> a powerful speech on Wednesday night by former president Bill Clinton</a>.</p> <p>Obama, who will be formally nominated by the party as its presidential nominee, builds on Clinton's message that the choice was between who wanted to be part of a \"We're all in this together society\" or a \"Winner take all, you're on your own society\".</p> <p>Obama says: \"On every issue, the choice you face won't be just between two candidates or two parties. It will be a choice between two different paths for America. A choice between two fundamentally different visions for the future.\"</p> <p>Having made history by becoming America's first black president, he is desperately fighting to ensure his presidency does not end in failure, unable to secure a second term. Polls show a tight race.</p> <p>One of the biggest criticisms of Obama is that economic recovery has been too slow under his stewardship. He counters that the economy could not be dealt with in just a few years.</p> <p>The same was true too, he says, of other problems that had developed over generations. His ambition is not just economic recovery and making sure his health care reform is implemented but tackling failing schools and energy dependence.</p> <p>\"I won't pretend the path I'm offering is quick or easy. I never have. You didn't elect me to tell you what you wanted to hear. You elected me to tell you the truth. And the truth is, it will take more than a few years for us to solve challenges that have built up over decades,\" Obama says.</p> <p>\"It will require common effort, shared responsibility, and the kind of bold, persistent experimentation that Franklin Roosevelt pursued during the only crisis worse than this one. And by the way \u2013 those of us who carry on his party's legacy should remember that not every problem can be remedied with another government programme or diktat from Washington.\"</p> <p>He adds: \"I'm asking you to rally around a set of goals for your country \u2013 goals in manufacturing, energy, education, national security, and the deficit; a real, achievable plan that will lead to new jobs, more opportunity, and rebuild this economy on a stronger foundation. That's what we can do in the next four years, and that's why I'm running for a second term as president of the United States.\"</p> <p>He promises to create a million new manufacturing jobs by the end of 2016. Mitt Romney has promised 12 million new jobs overall.</p> <p>He also promises to double exports by the end of 2014 and cut net oil imports in half by 2020.</p> <p>Even as voters digest Obama's remarks, there will be a sobering moment when the monthly jobs figures are published. Expectations are that they will show more positive news for Obama in previous months, with between 100,000 and 200,000 jobs created, but the overall unemployment rate is expected to remain stubbornly around the 8.3% mark \u2013 dangerously high for Obama's re-election chances.</p> <p>Meanwhile delegates in Charlotte were buoyed by a barnstorming, largely ad-libbed speech on Wednesday night by former president Bill Clinton, who was receiving plaudits from across the US political spectrum. Some Republican strategists went so far as predicting that the speech had handed Obama four more years in the White House.</p> <p>\"I wish to God as a Republican we had someone on our side who had the ability to do that,\" Steve Schmidt, the Republican strategist who helped run John McCain's campaign against Obama in 2008, told MSNBC.</p> <p>Another Republican strategist and media commentator, Alex Castellanos, was equally gushing. \"This will be the moment that probably re-elected Barack Obama,\" he told CNN.</p> <p>A leading Democrat, senator Chuck Schumer, disclosed that Clinton will follow up his speech with a series of campaign appearances on behalf of Obama next month.</p> <p>The Republicans \u2013 who view Americans' anger over unemployment as one of the keys to the White House \u2013 are set to pounce on those figures, arguing that the country is worse off now than when Obama became president in January 2009.</p>",
  "<p>Former President Bill Clinton wowed delegates and pundits alike with his Democratic national convention speech on Wednesday night. Clinton's success was no surprise. His sky-high favorability rating of 69% among the American public is matched by few other politicians, former or otherwise. But it wasn't always this way for the man from Hope.</p> <p>Indeed, Bill Clinton's relationship with the American public and even members of his own party is better described as a rollercoaster ride than a sustained love-fest. He's hit high highs, during his long career, but also lows that would dismay even the costliest New York shrink.</p> <p><strong>1. Clinton enters the 1992 Democratic convention with negative favorable ratings</strong></p> <p>After a primary season that saw Clinton overcome the Gennifer Flowers scandal, Clinton limped into the general election against President George HW Bush. A bad economy made Bush vulnerable, but it was independent Ross Perot who had jumped into the lead.</p> <p>Clinton's struggles were because of net favorables ranging from the negative single digits to the low double digits. Perhaps only Bob Dole and Mitt Romney have had worse standing among the American people for a challenger at the same point during the campaign.</p> <p>No problem for Clinton. He selected a popular running-mate in Al Gore, ran what was arguably the most successful convention in the modern era, and jumped out to a lead that he never lost.</p> <p><strong>2. Clinton's popularity drops quickly upon entering office</strong></p> <p>No president in polling history saw his approval ratings drop faster than Bill Clinton. Clinton's disapproval started to creep above his approval rating only four months into his presidency. Despite tremendous fallout from his pardoning of Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford managed to last four and a half months before his net approval rating went negative.</p> <p>Clinton's inability to control his domestic agenda was the cause of his drop in early 1993. His economic plan was derided as a tax-raiser, and he tried to fight on too many policy fronts at once. Clinton was eventually able to pass his budget by two votes in the House and a single vote in the Senate, but his popularity faded again following the Hillary Clinton-led failed attempt at healthcare reform.</p> <p>Clinton's Democrats would lose control of both the House and Senate in the 1994 midterm elections. Again though, Clinton pulled a rabbit out of the hat. He won a contentious government shutdown against congressional Republicans, led by Newt Gingrich, in 1995 and would go on to win the 1996 presidential election by nearly 10 points.</p> <p><strong>3. Clinton was personally disliked, though most thought he was doing a good job</strong></p> <p>Usually, a president's personal approval ratings match his job approval. There can be relatively minor differences, as Barack Obama has currently, but they are usually only a few percentage points.&#xa0;</p> <p>Following the Monica Lewinsky scandal, Clinton became an anomaly. Americans detested his personal behavior, yet the country's economy was humming. Republicans tried to take advantage of the prior and impeached him.</p> <p>The 1998 midterm elections became the first midterm in 66 years in which the president's party <em>gained</em> seats in the House of Representatives. It turned out that although only 35% of voters had a favorable view of Clinton as a person, his 55% job approval rating trumped his personal weaknesses. That 55% approval nearly matched the 56% who thought Clinton should stay in office despite the Lewinsky affair. Meanwhile, congressional approval had fallen to 41%, nearly identical to the 40% who did think Clinton should leave office.</p> <p><strong>4. Clinton leaves office the most popular president since the second world war</strong></p> <p>Names like Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Reagan dominate discussions of the most popular presidents over the last 60 years. Contrastingly, Bill Clinton was embroiled in some ugliest partisan battles in presidential history (remember Whitewater, Kenneth Starr, and the \"vast rightwing conspiracy\"). Today, though, we tend to remember Clinton as a president admired on both sides of the aisle. How so?</p> <p>Thanks to a booming economy, he left office with a 66% approval rating, including a 39% approval rating from Republicans \u2013 so that's how we remember him. (And compare that with war hero Dwight Eisenhower, who managed only a 59% final overall job approval rating.) By contrast, President Obama currently has an approval rating of just 7% among Republicans. </p> <p><strong>5. Clinton falters during the 2008 Democratic primary season</strong></p> <p>Even so, like any rollercoaster, Americans' perceptions of Bill Clinton took yet another dip. Clinton made a number of controversial statements during his wife's run for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008. From his \"biggest fairy tale\" comment about Barack Obama, to his remark about the role black voters played in Obama's victory in the South Carolina primary, Clinton came across as mean-spirited and even, in the eyes of some, as a race-baiting dogwhistler.</p> <p>Clinton's favorability rating dropped to 50% with the general public, but more surprising was how Democrats then viewed him. A quarter of all Democrats had an unfavorable opinion of Bill Clinton. This political base favorability rating is what you'd expect for a president who loses a general election by 5 to 10 points. (Fortunately for Clinton, he was no longer running for office.)</p> <p>Still, Clinton would persevere, as he always does. He mended fences with Obama and campaigned for him later in 2008. Today, Clinton's favorability rating of 69% includes an astronomical high of 93% among Democrats. Yet he maintains his cross-partisan appeal, with favorability scores of 68% with independents and 43% with Republicans.</p> <p>Bill Clinton truly embodies the saying that \"it's not how you start, but how you finish that counts.\"</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama expressed regret in a conference call with campaign volunteers disgruntled over being locked out from tonight's nomination speech.</p> <p>He told them: \"I just want to begin by saying how much I regret that we're not all gathering together in one place to deliver my acceptance speech tonight.\"</p> <p>Tens of thousands of volunteers have travelled to Charlotte, North Carolina, to hear Obama formally accept the party nomination for the White House race. Some had travelled long distances, a costly exercise involving air fares and hotels.</p> <p>But the speech was moved from the 73,000-seater Bank of America football stadium to the neighbouring convention centre, which holds only 23,000. Only those who had been attending the convention for the last two days are to be permitted access, leaving a potential crowd of 50,000 who had been allocated tickets outside.</p> <p>Some of the volunteers had qualified for tickets by doing nine or more hours of work for the campaign.</p> <p>Such a conference call with the president is unusual and may reflect the sense of grievance being conveyed upwards to the White House from field officers.</p> <p>In the call, Obama predicted it would be a \"really close election\" and that he would need their help.</p> <p>The reason for the switch from the stadium was safety concerns, he said. \"I could not ask you \u2013 our volunteers, our law enforcement, first responders \u2013 to subject themselves to the risk of severe thunderstorms,\" he said. Getting so many people into the stadium, with all the security concerns involved, was hard enough but getting them out would have been even tougher, Obama said.</p> <p>\"If we had started seeing severe thunderstorms and lightning, in particular, it would have been a problem. And we would have had a situation where we were putting you guys at risk.\"</p> <p>Party officials were trying to direct those without tickets to various venues round the city where they could watch the speech along with other fellow Democrats.</p> <p>The president said the switch meant there would be less fanfare than at the stadium.</p> <p>Responding to Republican claims that the switch had been because of fears he could not fill the stadium, reflecting a sense of disenchantment among the party grassroots, Obama said: \"The issue in this election is not going to be enthusiasm, because I think about you all on buses and in carpools and airplanes traveling here to Charlotte.\"</p> <p>He added: \"So my main message is we can't let a little thunder and lightning get us down. We're going to have to roll with it.\"</p> <p>He described the convention so far as unbelievable. \"Michelle \u2013 what can I say? I'm a little biased, but she was unbelievable. And yesterday president Clinton, who I think broke down the issues as effectively as anybody could,\" Obama said.</p>",
  "<p>Beaming from ear to ear, Jeremy Hunt called <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2012/sep/05/conservative-cabinet-reshuffle-explained-video\" title=\"\">his new NHS posting</a> \"the greatest privilege of my life\". That was before he saw his in-tray. He must by now be gazing at a pyramid of hand grenades with loose pins \u2013 although he may not recognise them until they explode.</p> <p>He is, after all, without any experience of this most complex and delicate service in the midst of a deliberately disruptive re-disorganisation and commercialisation, one the NHS chief executive famously calls \"big enough to be seen from space\". What's more, Hunt's job is to do two impossible things at once.</p> <p>First, it's full steam ahead on the great plan. Woebegone Andrew Lansley was assured there would be \"no stepping off the gas\". Indeed, set hard in law, under <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/mar/20/nhs-reform-health-bill-passes-vote\" title=\"\">the new act</a> there can be no turning back on the competition regime that lets \"any qualified provider\" bid for every part of the health service, a process already bursting out into more local private contracts than we can count. The NHS is the chosen testbed for the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2012/jul/11/open-public-services-white-paper-expectations\" title=\"\">Open Public Services white paper</a> plan to outsource all the public sector \u2013 though trying it first on the NHS was like putting in the miner to see if the air was safe for the canary. Hunt has no problem with the big idea; as co-author of a revealing 2005 pamphlet, he announced: \"Our ambition should be to break down the barriers between private and public provision, in effect denationalising the provision of health care in Britain.\" But between the neat ideology and the chaotic reality, he will find a great chasm.</p> <p>His second task contradicts the first: No 10's instructions are to close down NHS trouble before the election: stop the noise, tell a good story, schmooze the staff, keep it off the headlines \u2013 all this with cuts beyond anything the NHS has ever known. Lansley was sacked, they say, for failure to communicate: all that's needed is a change of messenger. Hunt's smiley face, silver tongue and naked ambition will ensure he neutralises Cameron's greatest electoral hazard after the economy. Frankly, it's a hopeless task: lipstick on a pig.</p> <p>What will he find? Cash crises breaking out all over. The King's Fund deputy director says cuts will be closer to \u00a350bn than \u00a320bn. John Appleby reports a 1% cut each year, compounded by 2.5% inflation, when the NHS always hits crisis without at least 2% above inflation to keep up with ageing patients. The NHS Confederation warns of \"a super-tanker heading for an&#xa0;iceberg\". There is emergency cash saved by the NHS Commissioning Board this year: Appleby expects mounting trouble from next year to election year. Labour private finance initiatives exacerbate the problem \u2013 but PFIs are only 1% of NHS turnover.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.slh.nhs.uk/\" title=\"\">South London Healthcare NHS Trust</a> in administration is harbinger to&#xa0;many more. Foundation trusts, supposedly financially secure, are among the next \u2013 Peterborough losing \u00a350m a year is top of the danger list, with a long tail of others. The Department of Health is cutting tariffs, putting the bottom 10% in peril. No 10 is alarmed by a string of A&amp;E and maternity units set for closure: with William Hague, Paul Burstow and Iain Duncan Smith demonstrating to save local hospitals, what chance of persuading the public that some re-configuring is essential?</p> <p>Set aside the destructive nature of the&#xa0;NHS plan, and the immediate crisis springs from creating total turmoil at a time of what Stephen Dorrell, the health select committee chair, calls the toughest cuts ever imposed on any health service in the OECD. The official price is \u00a33bn, but that's not counting lost productivity and expertise as everyone reapplies for their job and frightening numbers of senior managers quit, with a real shortage of expertise to fill the 212 clinical commissioning groups. Nick Timmins's report Never Again, a clear-eyed analysis of Lansley's chaotic act, quotes senior civil servants warning: \"We did point out to him that his plans were written before the big financial challenge, and didn't that change things? He completely did not see that at all. He completely ignored it.\"</p> <p>Labour fought the election with an honest if dangerous plan to rationalise many hospitals units. Health experts all agree it must be done. But however well planned and well consulted, closures are always unpopular. Cameron's flagrant dishonesty \u2013 \"I'll cut the deficit, not the NHS\", now neatly reversed \u2013 was matched by lies about \"Brown's cuts\" as he joined picket lines at Chase Farm hospital, long needing reorganisation, in 2007. That led to a cowardly moratorium on all closures for two crucial years. Now&#xa0;managers wait to see if Hunt&#xa0;will again kick these into post-election never-never land. If so, he will need to prise money from the Treasury to prop up failing hospitals, with money needed&#xa0;for the community.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the great ideological plan marches on. Here's the paradigm: <a href=\"http://www.basildonandthurrock.nhs.uk/\" title=\"\">Basildon and Thurrock University Hospitals</a>' accounts show an income drop of 13%. Why? Because severe rationing of treatments has cut the number sent for operations. The new president of the British Orthopaedic Association warns that rationing by \"draconian referral criteria\" for hip and knee replacement denies treatment until people lose their independence, while 120,000 wait on lists for more than 18 weeks. How will Basildon and others fill their cash gap?</p> <p>The Financial Times reports that the financial plan is for a large expansion of private work, aided by NHS restrictions fuelling a steep rise in patient-funded private surgery for hips and knees. So that's the way the NHS goes \u2013 rationing pushes more patients into the private sector: the act lets hospitals use 49% of beds for private work. Already insurance companies are jumping in to offer top-up cover for services the NHS is withdrawing. Under Labour, private practice dropped sharply as NHS waiting times fell to near zero: general hospitals were allowed to use only 2-3% of their facilities for private practice. Now that's in reverse \u2013 and it won't be popular.</p> <p>A burst of takeovers of GP surgeries by private companies is an early visible sign to the public of what's afoot: in Cameron's own Witney seat, Virgin Care has taken over <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/Services/gp/Overview/DefaultView.aspx?id=42569\" title=\"\">Deer Park Medical Centre</a>, with an exodus of staff and patients, amid many complaints about locums.</p> <p>Jeremy Hunt soon has to take secondary legislation through parliament so the regulator <a href=\"http://www.monitor-nhsft.gov.uk/\" title=\"\">Monitor</a>can absorb the competition board \u2013 the most contentious driver of NHS commercialisation. That will be rowdy. He may beam with satisfaction at the fulfilment of his pamphlet's plan. But that's a hard sell to most voters, no matter how nicely he smiles.</p> <p><em>polly.toynbee@theguardian.com </em></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 7 September 2012 because it said incorrectly that \"Monitor, the regulator, is cutting tariffs, putting the bottom 10% in peril\". Monitor is not yet involved setting NHS tariffs; it will be from 2014.</p>",
  "<p>In January of this year the parents of the exiled Iranian actor Golshifteh Farahani took a call at their apartment in Tehran from a man who said he was an official of the supreme court of the Islamic Republic. He began shouting at her father, telling him that his daughter would be punished, that her breasts would be cut off and presented to him on a plate.</p> <p>A few days earlier, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFJ9IChKF90\" title=\"\">Farahani had appeared in a short black-and-white video</a> with 30 other \"young hopes\" of the French cinema to promote the C\u00e9sars, the \"French Oscars\", where she had been nominated for her role in the winsome immigrant comedy <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-2L8m3Agtvg\" title=\"\">Si Tu Meurs, Je Te Tue (If You Die, I'll Kill You)</a>. The promo had each actor take off an item of clothing as they stared into the camera to commit their \"body and soul\" to their art. Farahani chose to bare her right breast, saying: \"I will put flesh to your dreams.\"</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oFJ9IChKF90?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"283\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oFJ9IChKF90\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>What followed in Iran was little short of a cultural earthquake. \"It was a catastrophe,\" she remembers, her head dropping into her hands. \"I don't know exactly how many tens of millions of people typed my name into Google the next day, I don't want to know \u2026\" A taboo of unimaginable proportions had been shattered, and not by some publicity-hungry provocateur, but by the most loved and admired actor in the country. Farahani may have only been another 29-year-old hopeful in France, but in Iran she became a star the moment she appeared in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0187809/\" title=\"\">Dariush Mehrjui's The Pear Tree</a> at 14. Eighteen films later there is more than a little of Garbo, Jeanne Moreau and Irene Papas about her: a rare beauty and intelligence married to a burning emotional honesty in a country where truth of any kind is hard to come by.</p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1113810/\" title=\"\">M for Mother</a> she seared herself into the national consciousness playing a pregnant woman gassed during the Iran-Iraq war, abandoned by her husband and now carrying \"a gift from God\" in her womb. Both rural and urban Iran embraced her as their down-to-earth hero: Golshifteh, the star without airs. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/marjane-satrapi\" title=\"\">Marjane Satrapi</a>, author of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2003/may/15/biography.iran\" title=\"\">Persepolis</a> who directed her in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1663321/\" title=\"\">Chicken with Plums</a>, says: \"She was not just Iran, she was the mother of Iran.\"</p> <p>The day the video was posted, when what she calls the \"fire\" started, the official Fars news agency in Tehran issued a communique lacerating her, saying that the pictures showed the \"hidden, disgusting face of cinema\". This kind of opprobrium had never before been poured on an artist, however much they had upset the regime. Her exile was now a banishment.</p> <p>Farahani had already been banned from working by the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance for not wearing a headscarf at the New York premiere of Ridley Scott's CIA thriller <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/126190/body.of.lies\" title=\"\">Body of Lies</a>, where, playing opposite Leonardo DiCaprio, she became the first Iranian actress to appear in a Hollywood film since the 1979 revolution.</p> <p>The film's critical take on the CIA \u2013 which overthrew Iran's last freely elected government in 1953 \u2013 cut little ice with the ayatollahs, who took her passport away as further punishment. Four years ago, with doors closing all around her amid a pre-election crackdown that would eventually spark the green revolution, Farahani fled to France after being in effect fined the impossible-to-pay sum of \u20ac2m. When she spoke out from Paris in favour of the failed green revolution, she was told not to return.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395794011\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/6/1346952522827/Farahani-in-About-Elly.-010.jpg\" alt=\"Farahani in About Elly.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Farahani in About Elly. Photograph: Everett Collection/Rex Featu</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett Collection/Rex Featu</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In a final twist of the knife, the censors banned the last film she made there, Asghar Farhadi's <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1360860/\" title=\"\">About Elly</a>, even before it was shown. Like many before her, Farahani had quietly ignored the ban to take the lead role, hoping it would all blow over.</p> <p>Strangely, it would never have seen the light of day, nor have won the Silver Bear at Berlin, had it not been saved by an unlikely intervention from President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad himself, who said it was \"not fair that a film be condemned by the mistake of one actress\".</p> <p>But that was before she slipped her shoulder out of her shirt with the unconscious air of Delacroix's Liberty Leading the People and became a lightning conductor for the divisions within Iranian society. Ahmadinejad is never likely to be so forgiving again.</p> <p>Farahani insists, however, that she did not set out to shock or provoke. \"I hate politics. It is not my job. As always, something you do for nothing becomes political. I knew it would be difficult. But I am living in France now, I have to work here, and either I am living here or I am not.</p> <p>\"It was a big shock for me and my family and for the whole of Iranian society. The good thing is it started a huge debate that could never have happened before. I was there watching people insult me, others answering them, others defending me, others attacking again.</p> <p>\"There were lots of fights within families. Young people especially saw who they were through this debate, and they saw the reality of people they were trusting in.\"</p> <p>The collateral damage was nevertheless immense. Her father, a lion of a man, a communist theatre director and a dissident both under the shah and Khomeini, stopped talking for five days and had to be admitted to hospital after repeated threats. \"It was very bad. This was the first time they couldn't support me. The fire was so strong that they were also burning in it.</p> <p>\"I should be careful because I know they are being held hostage \u2026 But then after a while, because of the background of my father \u2013 who dragged himself up from very humble origins \u2013 their feelings began to change. My father was afraid I had lost the support of the people, which is very important to him, because he has spent his whole life battling for the people, sacrificing everything. But after a month or two he saw the people had more respect for me, and he became very happy.</p> <p>\"They even went to a wedding of nomads in the centre of Iran. Everyone from all the generations came to them and held their hands and said: 'Don't be sad. We love Golshifteh.' My mother started crying. That is the beauty of Iran, and that is why I am so proud of being an Iranian, especially the women.\"</p> <p>But Farahani doesn't want to be a \"Joan of Arc, an actress 'with a story', an exotic victim of persecution. Exile is like death. You cannot understand it until it happens to you. The whole world wants to see you as a victim and they push you to be even more a victim because they see you miserable and they feel good. That is why French people are so obsessed with causes like Syria. It is a kind of pornography to make them feel better about being themselves, but they don't give a shit. They say, 'Come, we will look after you,' and then they fuck you up and don't give you papers. I am just an actor, and I want to work.\"</p> <p>That said, she is hugely grateful to France. \"For the first time in my life I appreciated being a woman. Paris is a city that liberates you as a woman from all your sins that you think you are guilty of, it washes away all of that and you are free.\"</p> <p>She pulls a white scarf around her shoulders. It's her old headscarf, \"my old friend\". \"The biggest problem for Iranian actresses,\" she says is not the government but the world outside \"who think we come out of our mothers with our heads covered\".</p> <p>\"Look at <a href=\"http://uk.imdb.com/name/nm0368689/\" title=\"\">Leila Hatami</a>. Normally after winning an Oscar [for Farhadi's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2011/jun/30/a-separation-review\" title=\"\">A Separation</a>] you get lots of work. But nothing is happening and she speaks four languages.\"</p> <p>But Farahani won't be held.

She tells how Farhadi \"tortured\" her on the set of About Elly, forcing her to break her voice for the part, making her shout at the Caspian sea for half an hour every morning before shooting and swallow chickpea flour so she could only croak and rasp. Her eardrum was perforated in the beating she took from another actor and he refused to let her be treated till they finished the next day. They haven't spoken since. \"He's my friend but he cannot talk to me. He is still coming and going from Iran. I am evil now. Paranoia is part of how they control you.\"</p> <p>\"I have scars from every film I have made,\" she says, lifting her sleeve and leg to show me. \"There is nothing to protect actors. They treat you worse than a dog. You work like a slave, and you know I like it. That is the way it should be. Every film should be like your last.\"</p> <p><em>About Elly is released on 14 September</em></p>",

I want him to get us fired up again and help us move forward.\"</p> <p>\"Colorado's going to be a tough state. We've typically won by nine percentage points in 2008. Of course the convention was in Colorado, so that helped. I think he just needs to let us see him as a person, and that he hasn't changed, and that he still has the hope and the commitment to move forward and to continue us on our economic improvement.

Obama carrying Florida will really send a powerful message for presidencies in the future.

  "<p>Barack Obama should be losing the 2012 presidential election \u2013 or so says the conventional wisdom. With <a href=\"http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS14000000\">unemployment above 8%</a>, a recovery that is mediocre at best and economic uncertainty far more the rule than the exception, there is certainly something to this argument. Yet, <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/\">according to polling guru Nate Silver</a>, President Obama is currently a 76% favorite for re-election.</p> <p>So why does Obama continue to maintain a small, yet stubborn lead not only in <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/p/2012-election/polls/president\">general election polling</a>, but \u2013 more importantly \u2013 in a <a href=\"http://www.quinnipiac.edu/institutes-and-centers/polling-institute/presidential-swing-states-%28fl-oh-and-pa%29/release-detail?ReleaseID=1781\">majority of key swing states</a>? It's the same reason he should be losing the presidential race: his Republican opponents.</p> <p>That might seem like a confusing explanation, but it's emblematic of the extent to which the GOP has been Obama's worst enemy over the past four years while, at the same time, may ensure that he is re-elected president.</p> <p>To unpack this admittedly convoluted argument, let's begin with focusing on the dominant political dynamic of the past four years. It's not about President Obama's legislative agenda or his post-partisan dreams, but rather the unceasing and unprecedented obstructionism of the Republican party. From day one of his presidency (actually, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/post/biden-mcconnell-decided-to-withhold-all-cooperation-even-before-we-took-office/2012/08/10/64e9a138-e302-11e1-98e7-89d659f9c106_blog.html\">even before Obama took office</a>), Republicans made the conscious decision to not just simply oppose Obama's entire policy agenda, but to actively and flagrantly thwart it. They promiscuously used the filibuster to block <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jul/12/news/la-pn-republicans-block-smallbusiness-tax-break-on-procedural-vote--20120712\">even the holding of votes on Democratic proposals in the Senate</a> and punished party members who contemplated the idea of working together with Obama or \u2013 even worse \u2013 compromising with him.</p> <p>Indeed, that Obama was even able to pass an <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-05/are-we-better-off-there-s-no-easy-answer.html\">$800bn stimulus measure</a> and <a href=\"http://www.healthcare.gov/law/index.html\">comprehensive healthcare reform</a> is perhaps the single most surprising political story, not just of the past four years, but indeed the past 40.</p> <p>The Republicans' obstructionist \"successes\" have taken a heavy toll and can be seen most dramatically in US economic performance since 2009. When fiscal policy has been expansive \u2013 as in the case of the stimulus being passed only a few weeks after Obama took office \u2013 the result has been <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/did-the-stimulus-work-a-review-of-the-nine-best-studies-on-the-subject/2011/08/16/gIQAThbibJ_blog.html\">job creation and economic growth</a> (albeit of the more tepid variety). When Congress has adopted GOP-favored policies of austerity \u2013 spending cuts and reliance on tax cuts to stimulate the economy \u2013 the results have been far worse. By consistently opposing and blocking any effort by Obama and the Democrats to grow the economy through additional stimulus measures, like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/12/republicans-defeat-obama-jobs-bill\">the president's job bill</a>, and even seeking to intimidate the Federal Reserve into focusing its attention on inflation rather than unemployment, they have actively undermined policies with the potential to spark an economic turnaround.</p> <p>While one can debate the morality of such an approach, the political results speak for themselves. An underperforming economy has harmed the president's political prospects and made him far more vulnerable to defeat than he would have been if Republicans had supported or, at least, not completely obstructed his stimulus efforts. This creates a rather disturbing political dynamic: namely, that the GOP strategy of obstructing Obama's agenda was political savvy and their only real hope of ensuring his defeat in 2012.</p> <p>Opposition was the only real alternative for a party intent on taking back the White House in four years, and it certainly helped Republicans to take back the house in 2010.</p> <p>Had Republicans been more supportive of his agenda, or at least allowed the Senate to hold votes on it, the economy would likely be in better shape and Obama would be in a far better position for re-election. From that perspective, obstructionism has been a net political plus for the GOP.</p> <p>But obstruction is not opposition, and this is where Republicans have left the door open for Obama. By giving the president no support for even the smallest bits of legislation (<a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/06/25/120625fa_fact_klein\">including programs they once supported</a>) and by not even allowing votes in the Senate on the president's agenda, they went from loyal oppositionists to relentless and partisan scolds \u2013 a point brilliantly <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0912/80808.html?hp=t1_b1\">reiterated by former President Clinton in his speech at the Democratic convention Wednesday night</a>.</p> <p>This is the downside to the GOP's four-year scorched-earth policy. By adopting such extreme anti-Obama positions, by taking the stance that any and all efforts to use the resources of the federal government to grow the economy are incipient socialism, and by making the political defeat of Obama, rather than just his policies, the party's central priority has opened up Republicans to the charge that they have been needless obstructionists who had no plan of their own for fixing the economy. It's hard not to see Romney's failure to offer any serious policy proposals for turning the economy around at his own convention as evidence of a party that refuses to contemplate any policy that doesn't include cutting taxes or shrinking regulation.</p> <p>So the same radical anti-government forces that push Republicans to reject every element of President Obama's policy agenda also make it impossible for the party's standard-bearer to offer voters anything more than empty platitudes.</p> <p>Far worse, the GOP has learned the hard way that, metaphorically, if you lie down with dogs, you get fleas. Implicit acceptance of the far right's narrative of Obama as an America-hating socialist has activated the GOP's most radical wing of voters. Republicans took a position not simply of implacable hostility to Obama's policies, but to the man himself. As these extreme voices have increased their influence within the party, they've moved Republicans <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/12/michael-cohen-republicans-embrace-extreme-right\">further and further to the uncompromising right on a host of issues</a> \u2013 from immigration to birth control and abortion \u2013 forcing their party's nominee to take policy positions that alienate even those voters disappointed in Obama's economic performance and inclined to look elsewhere.</p> <p>Perhaps the greatest cost of this approach is that while polls show that <a href=\"http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/elections/election_2012/election_2012_presidential_election/trust_on_issues_obama_v_romney\">voters believe Romney would be a better steward of the economy</a>, they view Obama as someone who is <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/08/solid-chances-serious-challenges-greet-romney-at-his-convention/\">more likely to favor the middle class and is more in touch with the challenges that affect them directly</a>. That reservoir of trust, combined with the GOP's paucity of ideas, might just be enough for Obama to slide in for a second term.</p> <p>Finally, by adopting such stridently oppositionist positions, not just against Obama but against the notion that the federal government had any responsibilities beyond shrinking itself into oblivion, Republicans have provided a boost to the Democrats' vision of government. Voters <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/151490/Fear-Big-Government-Near-Record-Level.aspx?utm_source=alert&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=syndication&amp;utm_content=morelink&amp;utm_term=Business%20-%20Politics\">may still recoil habitually at the idea of big government</a>, but they almost certainly recoil even further from the uncompromising alternative offered by the GOP. In desperate pursuit of political advantage, they have given Obama and the Democrats an opportunity to capture the political middle and redefine liberalism in terms that make it more palatable to a broad cross-section of voters.</p> <p>This is only one part of the long-term damage. By adopting stances of such rigid ideological purity, by needlessly offending the fastest growing minority groups in the country, as well as young voters, and, finally, by basing the party's short-term renaissance on the oldest and most reactionary voters, Republicans have left themselves in a political no-man's land, should they lose this election. Rebuilding a party that has bet its entire political future on unceasing hostility to Obama will not be so easy. In the end, Republicans placed all their chips on seeking to defeat Obama's agenda and, above all, Obama himself. That opposition has brought with it consequences that might not only backfire on election day, but may well also ensure that the GOP spends more than just four more years toiling in the political wilderness. </p> <p>For Obama, Republican hostility has left him bruised and in far worse shape politically than perhaps he should be in. But as he gives his acceptance speech at the Democratic national convention, he has the opportunity to turn the tables on those who have sought so lustily to thwart him. I'm guessing he won't miss the opportunity.</p>",
  "<p>\"We were so young, so in love, and so in debt,\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/05/michelle-obama-four-more-years\">Michelle Obama told delegates in Charlotte on Tuesday night</a>, reminiscing about at time when she and the future president had combined student loan bills that were larger than their mortgage.</p> <p>\"That's why Barack has fought so hard to increase student aid and keep interest rates down \u2013 because he wants every young person to fulfil their promise and be able to attend college without a mountain of debt.\"</p> <p>Bill Clinton made student debt a component of his epic speech to the convention on Wednesday night too. Obama's student loan plan, he said, meant \"no-one will ever have to drop out of college again for fear they can't repay their debt.\"</p> <p>Both speakers received huge applause for their comments. But how did it play with real students on the convention perimeter?</p> <p>Neither the first lady nor the former president mentioned that here in North Carolina, many students <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/09/05/in-north-carolina-student-insurance-costs-rise-under-obamacare/\">have faced extra costs this year</a> as a result of Obama's Affordable Care Act.</p> <p>The University of North Carolina warned in April that students at the university, and at other schools across the state, would have to pay more for university healthcare. \"Based on more than three semesters of actual claims experience, as well as the new provisions of the Affordable Care Act, we are facing large increases in premiums for our students,\" the university's president, Tom Ross, wrote.</p> <p>Students in North Carolina are required to have health insurance to attend. If they are not on their parents' plan, and do not have a personal plan, they must join a university policy.</p> <p>\"I do have to get health insurance, and it did go up,\" said Xeminia Edwards, from Statesville, North Carolina. Edwards is an anthropology major at UNC Charlotte, who was taking a break between classes on Wednesday afternoon. She had been struck by the hike. \"I think it was around $300-400 last year, and this year it's $700. It kind of sucks because I pay $700 for health insurance but I have a $350 deductible.\"</p> <p>Obama narrowly won North Carolina, traditionally a Republican stronghold, in 2008, but faces an uphill battle to retain the state in November, with the latest polls putting him about four points behind Mitt Romney.</p> <p>\"I don't feel like he has performed well for students. Interest rates keep going up on our loans and it doesn't look like they're ever going to go down,\" said Nick, a 22-year-old studying computer science. He voted for Obama in 2008, but said he would commit to Mitt Romney this time around.</p> <p>\"I don't personally believe in [Romney's] social reforms, but on the fiscal side at least he has an idea of what we should do. Obama's had his chance and he's kind of been slipping.\"</p> <p>In a May paper, A Chance for Every Child, Romney argued that \"flooding colleges with federal dollars only serves to drive tuition higher\" and said he would simplify the financial aid system and regulations to encourage competition and reduce costs. Romney has said <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/22/mitt-romney-obama-student-loan-debt_n_1820062.html\">he will not boost Pell grants</a> or help students pay off loans.</p> <p>Since elected Obama has increased the maximum for Pell grants available to college students, and his 2009 economic stimulus introduced tax credits enabling some young people to save $2,500 a year. If re-elected, Obama has promised to make those tax credits permanent, while <a href=\"http://www.eaglenews.org/gop-obama-spar-over-rising-college-costs-1.2756812#.UEe8a7-XQvk\">he has proposed linking federal aid to schools</a> with their ability to keep tuition fees low.</p> <p>While some students in North Carolina will pay more for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, nationwide many will pay a lot less. Stephen, who at 25 is studying mechanical engineering in Charlotte, found himself eligible for healthcare on his parents' policy under Obama's health provisions \u2013 which increased the age students could stay on their parents' plans to 26.</p> <p>\"For a while I had to have my own plan and it was quite a bit more expensive for me, rather than being on a family plan for another couple of years. Saved some money,\" he said.</p> <p>Young people were a crucial part of Obama's victory in 2008, the president claiming 66% of the under-30 vote. http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1031/young-voters-in-the-2008-election But with<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/13/business/student-loans-weighing-down-a-generation-with-heavy-debt.html?pagewanted=all\"> the average student debt at $23,300</a> in 2011, more than $1tn currently outstanding in student loans, and an unemployment rate among young workers of 17.1%.</p> <p>Gallup's long-range average polling still shows Obama with a significant lead, 60% of under-30s compared to Romney's 33%, but enthusiasm looks to have waned, with only 60% of registered voters under 30 saying they will definitely vote.</p> <p>Michelle Obama's speech <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/election-2012/wp/2012/09/04/dnc-2012-michelle-obamas-speech-at-the-democratic-national-convention-full-text/?tid=pm_politics_pop\">touched on more than student debt</a>, however, hinting at the negative impact on women's rights under Romney and stressing Obama's ability to empathise as a man with a history of \"turning down high paying jobs and instead working in struggling neighborhoods\". There were signs from the students the Guardian spoke to on Wednesday that enthusiasm for the president was still high.</p> <p>Despite Edwards being hit by the healthcare rise, she said Romney and the Republicans' stance on social issues was more important.</p> <p>\"If I had to vote today I would still vote for Obama. A lot of it is because of the whole women's rights thing that's come out with Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan. I'm a woman gender studies minor, so that's really big for me.\"</p> <p>Kamoru Jimoh, who moved from Louisiana to North Carolina aged six, and now at 25 is studying philosophy and economics, said he was looking for someone \"who can see things from my perspective\".</p> <p>\"I know that Obama went to school and I know that he got in debt. He had to pay his tuition back. So if nothing else, he knows what it's like to be in my shoes and he knows that it I uncomfortable to be in my shoes right now.</p> <p>\"Mitt Romney? Even if he did go to college, even if he did go to school, he's had plenty of money to not have to worry about ever being in debt. So how are you going to start telling me how you're going to help me handle my problems, when you've never really been involved in that problem?\"</p>",
  "<p>With just days to go before London 2012 is banished to memory and the Olympic Park can prepare for its future as the derelict backdrop to a&#xa0;million gritty Channel 4 dramas about gang violence, it is time to face facts. Yes, it was fun being proud to be British. Yes, by the end of the Paralympics even the most hardened of&#xa0;us had managed to stop instinctively flinching at the sight of a union flag. But enough's enough. It is probably time to start agreeing again that Americans are better than us.</p> <p>No, really, they are. Americans are better than us because they know how to commit. Look at how their celebrities endorse rightwing politicians. Would a&#xa0;British celebrity ever champion a Tory by publicly muttering incoherent abuse at an empty chair for 12 solid minutes? Would a British celebrity turn&#xa0;up on YouTube to make a series of&#xa0;dark threats about the millennium of catastrophe that would engulf the planet if Ed Miliband ever made it to the other side of the House of Commons? Hardly. The best David Cameron could manage was Gary Barlow, and all he did was launch a rubbishy X Factor rip-off scheme in Nantwich and look for all the world like a man ready to accept the sweet release of death.</p> <p>Americans are better than us because they count Clint Eastwood and Chuck Norris as two of their own \u2013 both grizzled, no-nonsense men's men who will do whatever it takes to ensure that Mitt Romney ousts Barack Obama in November. Even if that means using their positions of influence to spout such an aggressive torrent of cobblers that the rest of us can't help but react in the same way we would if our dad turned up to our school disco in a backwards-facing baseball cap and started yelling the word \"nang\" at the&#xa0;dinnerladies.</p> <p>Let's start with Clint. There was a&#xa0;time when he was the coolest man alive \u2013 poised and simmering and economical and intimidating beyond words. Even though that man disappeared long ago \u2013 replaced by someone preoccupied with directing shamelessly middlebrow Oscar bait and occasionally appearing on his wife's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLJT1hQtpY4\" title=\"\">dizzyingly vapid reality TV show</a> \u2013 it was nevertheless still a horrible surprise to see him turn up at the Republican national convention in Florida last week and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoqKdWY692k\" title=\"\">haltingly lambast an empty barstool</a> for its continued inability to&#xa0;travel to universities in anything other than an inappropriately sized aeroplane, until the chair apparently told him to go and screw himself.</p> <p>However, even though the outside world reacted with mortification that Clint a) was endorsing Romney in such&#xa0;a painfully confused way and b)&#xa0;apparently now has a voice like Kermit the Frog, the speech seemed to go down well with its target audience \u2013 convention attendees who keep accidentally wearing flags on their heads instead of hats. So much so, in&#xa0;fact, that Clint should give serious consideration to taking this double act on the road. It would be like the Sooty Show, but with a chair instead of a puppet and Dirty Harry's grandpa instead of Harry Corbett. The chair could come on inside a giant box. \"Who wants to see President Obamachair?\" Clint could ask, to wild applause. \"President Obamachair is very shy, so you'll have to cheer louder than that,\" Clint could add, goading the crowd to higher and higher levels of hysteria until the chair finally bursts out of the box, squirts Clint in the face with a water pistol and then tells him to go and screw himself again. It would be brilliant. I'd certainly pay to see it.</p> <p>But Clint made one fatal flaw during his speech. While endorsing Romney, he admitted that the history-making emotion of Obama's inauguration had actually made him cry. Luckily, there was no such flakiness from Norris, the grizzle-faced star of 1983's <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085862/\" title=\"\">Lone Wolf McQuade</a>. Perhaps stung by his lack of invitation to join Clint at the Republican national convention, Chuck took matters into his own hands on Monday by making <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFLNmThRMNQ\" title=\"\">a YouTube video</a> simply entitled \"Chuck Norris WARNING America '1,000 Years of Darkness' if Obama Wins\".</p> <p>In the video, Chuck and his wife Gena stand hand in hand inside a&#xa0;karate dojo and beg 30 million non-voting evangelical Christians to cast their ballots against Obama in the upcoming election, lest America fall into the evil grip of \"socialism ... or something much worse\".</p> <p>Chuck doesn't specify what this \"something much worse\" is, although one would expect it is either a world where the <a href=\"http://www.gearfuse.com/chuck-norris-action-jeans-the-only-pants-made-for-roundhousing/\" title=\"\">Chuck Norris Action Jean</a> was never invented, or a world where the US is governed by an immobile yet&#xa0;oddly profane barstool and its dishevelled, confused-looking translator. In fact, that's probably it. After all, this is Chuck Norris we're talking about. He didn't get to be a universal walking punchline by being inherently ridiculous in everything he says or does, did he?</p> <p>This is the kind of all-out, balls-to-the-wall celebrity endorsement that America does best. Britain is simply playing catch-up. Let's hope that Cameron is watching this story unfold.

  "<p>Barack Obama has stated categorically that Americans are better off than they were four years ago, as he prepares for primetime acceptance speech on Thursday night to the Democratic national convention in Charlotte.</p> <p>After a week of confused messaging by the normally disciplined Obama campaign, the president attempted to state the case clearly. \"We are absolutely better off than we were when I was sworn in and we were losing 800,000 jobs in a month,\" Obama told Virginia radio station NBC 12 in a interview broadcast a few hours before he was scheduled address delegates in North Carolina.</p> <p>Earlier in the week, senior Democratic figures gave different answers, with some saying the country was not better off and others saying it was. Even Obama had earlier adopted a cautious position, saying definitively that the country was better off, only that his work was incomplete.</p> <p>Obama was on Thursday preparing for his main speech of the convention, which aides said would focus in part on foreign policy.</p> <p>Although polls suggest that foreign affairs is low down on the list of voter priorities, the president is to tout US success in finally tracking down Osama bin Laden, the exit from Iraq and the start of the process of winding down the war in Afghanistan.</p> <p>Jen Psaki, Obama's media spokeswoman, noted that Mitt Romney had last week gone through a 45-minute speech without once mentioning Afghanistan or Iraq. </p> <p>Psaki said Obama would offer much more \"concrete\" policy detail than Romney last week and no-one on Friday would be unaware of his plans for another four years in office.</p> <p>Even as voters are digesting Obama's remarks on Friday, there will be a sobering moment when the monthly jobs figures are published. Expectations are that they will show more positive news for Obama in previous months, with between 100,000 and 200,000 jobs created, but the overall unemployment rate is expected to remain stubbornly around the 8.3% mark \u2013 dangerously high for Obama's re-election chances.</p> <p>Asked about the impact of the figures, Psaki said Obama would note the 29 straight months of increases in new jobs.</p> <p>Meanwhile delegates in Charlotte were buoyed by a barnstorming, largely ad-libbed speech on Wednesday night by former president Bill Clinton, who was receiving plaudits from across the US political spectrum. Some Republican strategists went so far as predicting that the speech had handed Obama four more years in the White House.</p> <p>\"I wish to God as a Republican we had someone on our side who had the ability to do that,\" Steve Schmidt, the Republican strategist who helped run John McCain's campaign against Obama in 2008, told MSNBC.</p> <p>Another Republican strategist and media commentator, Alex Castellanos, was equally gushing. \"This will be the moment that probably re-elected Barack Obama,\" he told CNN.</p> <p>A leading Democrat, senator Chuck Schumer, disclosed that Clinton will follow up his speech with a series of campaign appearances on behalf of Obama next month.</p> <p>The Republicans \u2013&#xa0;who viewing Americans' anger over unemployment as one of the keys to the White House \u2013 are set to pounce on those figures, arguing that the country is worse off now than when Obama became president in January 2009.</p> <p>In his Virginia radio interview, Obama also expressed regret over his remark earlier on the campaign trail in which he said 'You didn't build that', a comment that the Republicans adopted as the theme of their convention in Tampa, Florida, last week. \"Obviously, I have regrets for my syntax,\" Obama said.</p> <p>But he stood by the point he was trying to make, that though individual entrepreneurs build businesses, they still needed the infrastructure that the federal government provided.</p> <p>Obama also held a conference call to express his regret that thousands of campaign volunteers, many of whom had travelled a long way to attend, would be unable to hear his nomination speech at the 73,000-seater Bank of America stadium, after the event was moved to the smaller Time Warner Cable arena over bad weather fears.</p> <p>The president said: \"I just want to begin by saying how much I regret we are not all gathered in one place \u2026 I know it is disappointing. I know a lot of you have come a long way.\"</p> <p>Obama's campaign staff, including senior adviser David Plouffe, did a series of interviews on Thursday, saying they did not anticipate a poll bounce following the convention, even though it is generally regarded to have had more energy and better speeches than the Republican event in Florida last week.</p> <p>\"We've always believed that there's very little elasticity in the election,\" Plouffe told ABC. \"You're not going to see big bounces in this election. For the next 61 days, it's going to remain tight as a tick.\"</p> <p>But Democratic delegates are hoping for a poll breakthrough after speeches by Michelle Obama on Tuesday night and Clinton on Wednesday night.</p> <p>Clinton lifted morale with a 48-minute speech that combined folksy ad-libs with a detail-packed, point-by-point rebuttal of Republican attacks on Obama's record. </p> <p>He couched the November 6 ballot as a choice between whether voters wanted to be part of a \"We're all in this together society\" or or a \"Winner take all, you're on your own society\".</p> <p>\"We simply cannot afford to give the reins of government to someone who will double down on trickledown,\" Clinton said.</p> <p>It was also a powerful positive argument for re-electing Obama to finish the job of securing recovery, a task Clinton said neither he nor any other president could have delivered in just four years.</p> <p>In a week that has seen the Obama campaign grapple unconvincingly with the question \"Are voters better off than four years ago?\", Clinton had an unequivocal response.</p> <p>\"Now, are we where we want to be today? No. Is the president satisfied? Of course not. But are we better off than we were when he took office? The answer is: yes.\"</p> <p>Since 1961, Clinton said, Democrats had held power for 24 years, the Republicans 28, and the economy had created 66m private sector jobs in that period. \"So what's the job score? Republicans, 24 million; Democrats, 42 [million],\" he said.</p> <p>It is a long way from 2008, when Clinton made many bitter remarks about Obama during the campaign by his wife, Hillary, for the Democratic presidential nomination, and Obama campaign officials branded the former president a racist. Even the most diehard member of Obama's inner circle, where there is still lingering animosity from four years ago, would find it hard to say that Clinton did not deliver for his successor on the night. Even Obama said: \"He broke down the issues as effectively as anyone could.\"</p> <p>The president, Clinton said, contrary to accusations by the Republicans, had sought to work with the other side in Congress but had been repeatedly rebuffed. His instinct was towards co-operation. \"Obama appointed several members of his cabinet even though they supported Hillary. Heck, he even appointed Hillary,\" he said, his best joke of the night.</p> <p>The core of his speech dealt with the ideological divide between the parties. \"My fellow Americans, all of us in this grand hall and everybody watching at home, when we vote in this election we'll be deciding what kind of country we want to live in. If you want a winner-take-all, you're on your own society you should support the Republican ticket.\"</p> <p>\"But if you want a country of shared opportunities and shared responsibility, a we're-all-in-this-together society, you should vote for Barack Obama and Joe Biden.\"</p>",
  "<p>Hugo Ch\u00e1vez has claimed reports of a massacre of 80 Yanomami Indians were hyped to damage him before next month's presidential election. After a government investigation into the alleged killing by goldminers turned up nothing, the Venezuelan president said the issue had been exaggerated by news organisations and the opposition to score political points.</p> <p>\"As soon as someone says something, or an NGO puts out some document, they [local and international media] take it and if it harms Ch\u00e1vez they say publish it, on the front page, for several days \u2026 and spice it up,\" he told a press conference. The allegations \u2013 publicised by Survival International and based on testimony by Yanomami \u2013 were that villagers had been firebombed and shot in July by illegal goldminers from Brazil. Officials say they found no evidence to support these claims at Irathotheri, where the killings were said to have taken place.</p> <p>\"We visited all of the surrounding communities. I personally spoke to the chief of Irathotheri and he told me everything was fine \u2026 When there is mining you see the forest destroyed. I saw nothing of this,\" said the minister for indigenous affairs, Nicia Maldonado. \"I had been saying there was no massacre all along but there are people who wanted to blame the president and destroy the revolution, but the revolution and president Ch\u00e1vez have been strengthened by this.\"</p> <p>With the issue highly politicised before the 7 October election, NGOs and indigenous groups remain sceptical that officials visited all the remote villages where the killings might have taken place. They have issued a statement demanding a more thorough and transparent investigation. The government of Brazil had earlier called for clarity about what happened.</p> <p>\"Our contacts on the ground have said that the government has not conducted a full investigation in the community itself,\" said Sarah Shenker of Survival International in Brazil. \"We are just one month until the elections so it is quite possible that people on either side are using this to their advantage \u2026 It is such a remote area that it might take a really long time for the truth come out,\" she said.</p> <p>Massacre allegations were among dire news for the Ch\u00e1vez administration in August that included a prison riot, a deadly blast in a refinery and the collapse of an interstate bridge linking the capital to Venezuela's eastern region. But most polls suggest the president is on course for victory. Datanalisis gave Ch\u00e1vez a 14.3-point lead over the opposition candidate Henrique Capriles after a two-point widening of the gap in August. Ch\u00e1vez claimed on Tuesday it was now \"mathematically impossible\" for him to lose the election. But there is a huge divergence in the forecasts. One poll suggests Capriles may be ahead by a fraction.</p> <p>The president's health \u2013 which was the dominant issue early in the campaign \u2013 remains a concern, but Ch\u00e1vez has maintained a vigorous campaign schedule and a strong ideological rhetoric, mixed with occasional off-the-cuff remarks including comments on Tuesday about his admiration for Hollywood hardmen such as Clint Eastwood and Sean Connery.</p> <p>\"One time I was given a collection of films by Clint Eastwood and I spent about a month hardly sleeping since I was watching one every night after work,\" he said. \"I never missed a 007 film by Sean <a href=\"http://topics.bloomberg.com/sean-connery/\" title=\"\">Connery</a> and The Hunt for Red October was a tremendous film, even if it ends with the Yankee empire on top.\"</p> <p>Eastwood recently appeared at the Republican Convention, where he criticised the US president, Barack Obama. Ch\u00e1vez said this was unsurprising as Eastwood was a \"great actor but a man of the right\".</p> <p>\"Obama's response was very wise. He said: 'I admire Clint <a href=\"http://topics.bloomberg.com/clint-eastwood/\" title=\"\">Eastwood</a>, and whoever is offended easily should seek another profession,'\" the Venezuelan president added.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 10 September 2012 to correct the wording of quotes from Sarah Shenker and the spelling of her name.</p>",
  "<p>For the past three years Ed Neufeldt has been wearing the same green rubber bracelets stamped \"Jobs for America\". He plans to take them off when unemployment in his home town of Elkhart, Indiana, falls below 8%. That day appears, finally, to be approaching \u2013 albeit achingly slowly. \"The whole United States is not doing that good,\" Neufeldt says. \"But here we're better off than we were three years ago.\"</p> <p>Few towns hold as much history for Barack Obama's presidency as Elkhart. This was the city where he fought to establish himself as the candidate of hope and change, first in a bruising encounter with Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination and then for the presidency. On his road to victory, Obama visited here four times in 15 months, and in February 2009 he chose Elkhart for his first trip outside Washington since his inauguration.</p> <p>Neufeldt, then an unemployed recreational vehicle worker, was thrust into the national spotlight when he was chosen to introduce the newly inaugurated president of the United States at a local rally. \"I am hoping and praying that president Obama will put the people of Elkhart County back to work. The stakes are high,\" Neufeldt said then.</p> <p>\"I promised you back then if I was elected, I would do everything I could to help this community recover, and that's why I'm back here today,\" said Obama as he pushed the American Recovery Act, an $800bn stimulus plan he hoped would get America back to work.</p> <p>Back then unemployment in the area was 18%. Obama charmed the locals, playing basketball with children in the streets and dipping into local diners to the shock and delight of proprietors and patrons alike. And he made big promises.</p> <p>Four years on, Elkhart has gone from a symbol of Obama's message of hope to a perfect example of the biggest hurdle the president faces in his bid for re-election: the gap between empirical measures that show economic recovery, and the pain people continue to feel. That is why Obama will have one clear goal when he delivers his acceptance speech to the Democratic national convention in Charlotte, North Carolina on Thursday night: spelling out a compelling economic case for giving him four more years.</p> <p>\"Are you better off than you were four years ago?\" Ronald Reagan famously asked voters in the 1980 campaign. It is the question that looms over the 2012 presidential election, and one which has dogged the Obama campaign this week as they have struggled to come up with a convincing answer. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395775428\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/9/6/1346958633632/US-labour-statistics-001.jpg\" alt=\"US labour statistics\" width=\"460\" height=\"334\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">US labour statistics.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p></p> <p>The data suggests the American people are. On Friday, economists expect the latest employment figures to show that the US added another 100,000-plus jobs last month. The US has added jobs every month since October 2010. There are other positive economic signs: car sales are bouncing back, and even the housing market seems on the mend.</p> <p>In Elkhart, too, the numbers say people are far better off than they were when Obama took office. Unemployment in the region is now around 8.9%, and the city, with a population shy of 51,000, is clearly on the mend. Local unemployment is still above the national average, just, but shipments in the RV industry, the area's biggest employer, are nearly back to pre-recession levels after hitting 20 year lows in 2009.</p> <h2>'We're never gonna go under 8% unemployment'</h2> <p>Life has got better, too, for Ed Neufeldt since he introduced the president during his visit. Now 72, Neufeldt is back in work, but things are not good enough for him to contemplate retirement. Once he lived in relative comfort, earning $20 an hour job at Monaco, an RV manufacturer that went bankrupt in 2009. Now he works part-time as a bread truck driver for $9 an hour, and has an evening job cleaning offices for another $11 an hour. It doesn't add up to his pre-recession income. \"I had to work three years for a dime raise,\" he says.</p> <p>\"When I met president Obama I really liked him, but I think because of automation and modern technology we're never gonna go under 8% employment,\" he says.</p> <p>America's midwest and the Great Plains are rebounding from the recession faster than other parts of the country \u2013 helped in large part by the recovery in the auto industry that followed Obama's bailout. The region is home to three swing states \u2013 Iowa, Ohio and Wisconsin \u2013 and in all three the economy is pulling, slowly, out of the doldrums.</p> <p>But it's far from assured that Obama can benefit politically from that recovery. In 2008, he became the first Democratic nominee to win Indiana in 44 years. And yet strategists in both parties say Indiana is the state he is least likely to hold on to in 2012.</p> <p>Summer Sellers, 33, is another Elkhart resident who was worse off in 2008. Several stints of unemployment eventually led her to the social media job she has now. And while Sellers admits that the enthusiasm Obama's visits generated in those early visits has faded, she still has hope that the people who voted for him in 2008 will return to the polls to cast a vote for him in November. </p> <p>\"I haven't really heard too much from other people about Obama staying in office versus getting somebody else,\" Sellers said. \" I still have the feeling that people in my generation around here who voted for Obama before will vote for him again.\" </p> <p>The RV museum, Elkhart's museum to the industry that provides two thirds of its jobs, is celebrating 100 years of RV evolution. Visitors walk a road that shows how the industry has developed from a 1913 Earl Travel Trailer, which looks like well-made a camp tent on wheels and is towed by a Model T Ford, past the rather modest RV Mae West used on set and spartan shining silver Airstreams on to today's hi-tech, Wi-Fi ready behemoths.</p> <p>The museum's president, Darryl Searer, gives Obama little credit for Elkhart's turnaround, however. \"I've witnessed four major recessions in my life: this one has lasted the longest,\" he says. \"Why? I think because Washington is not business-friendly.\"</p> <p>Searer sees himself as a political independent. When Obama was elected he was hopeful that something would change. But he says the administration has failed to tackle the housing crisis and is angry that it poured billions into saving the auto industry and other bust businesses that he believes should have been allowed to fail.</p> <p>\"When you reward failure, you just create more failure,\" he says. Elkhart's RV industry has bounced back but at the expense of other areas of the country that have lost market share, he says. It's survival of the fittest.</p> <p>Searer, who says the RV industry has always been sensitive to the economic cycle, also runs Ultra-Fab Products, a parts business he says grew at 30% a year between 2003 and 2008 before the recession hit hard. After a couple of losing years, business is back again, but he doesn't believe Obama's policies have helped. \"It's not because of government. It's because I figured out how to make money,\" he says. He says Obama is \"anti-business\". \"I think everybody here had hope but as time has gone on it just hasn't worked out,\" he says.</p> <h2>'Obama hasn't done a thing for agriculture. I'd give him an F'</h2> <p>It's not just those in the RV industry that are disappointed. At the massive Elkhart County 4-H Fair, attendances are back to levels last seen in 2006. About 250,000 people visited in July to see children show off their prize sheep and cows, enjoy the rides, eat deep-fried Twinkies and other delights and watch '80s rockers Styx and Glenn Campbell on his goodbye tour. </p> <p>But agriculture is in crisis, too. Drought has sent the price of corn rocketing, and Obama's ethanol mandate will mean 40% of this year's crop is turned into fuel, keeping prices high. \"I don't think Obama's done one thing for agriculture,\" says John Hochstetter, a local dairy farmer. He calculates the soaring cost of corn cost him $100,000 extra over July and August. He's not impressed with Mitt Romney, either. \"A country is not a business,\" he says. But as far as Obama is concerned: \"I'd give him an F.\"</p> <p>There are uglier views on Obama at the fair. \"He's not even American. If I had his background, they wouldn't let me even board a plane,\" says one clearly angry lawnmower salesman before refusing to give his name. But mostly Obama's critics are more disappointed than angry. \"A man can only do so much,\" says Phillip Ray, a retired RV industry worker. \"But it's the economy that is going to decide whether he gets re-elected or not whether that's fair or not.\"</p> <p>Douglas Agbetsiafa, a professor of economics at Indiana University, says the turnaround in the region has been \"remarkable.\" Elkhart and the surrounding region was hit harder and faster by the recession than almost any other part of the US, he said.</p> <p>It wasn't until the end of 2010 that recovery really started to take hold, but by then the turnaround was dramatic, Agbetsiafa said. In the last three month of 2010 unemployment dropped from 17% to 13% and has continued to fall sharply ever since. Agbetsiafa says the stimulus money and the car industry bailout \"probably did help, especially in the early stage.\" </p> <p>But it is very difficult to separate out what came from the stimulus and what from the area's historically business friendly policies. Who gets the credit may well ultimately be decided by political persuasion as much as economics, he says.</p> <p>\u2022 This report was produced in conjunction with the Elkhart Truth newspaper. <a href=\"http://www.etruth.com/article/20120906/NEWS01/709069975\">Read Tim Vandenack's report here</a></p>",

  "<p>A rash of legal challenges to a core piece of US civil rights legislation is threatening the foundations of nearly half a century of laws to combat racial discrimination.</p> <p>Republican-led state legislatures from Florida and Texas to Alaska have engineered a series of legal showdowns with the federal government over the 1965 Voting Rights Act that, following several court rulings last week, appear likely to end up before a US supreme court which has already hinted it is ready to revisit the heart of the law.</p> <p>Civil rights activists warn that if the supreme court strikes down a key section of the Voting Rights Act, which gives the federal government some control over elections in states with a history of blocking African Americans from voting, then separate legislation affecting discrimination in other areas, such as in employment, education and housing, may also be vulnerable.</p> <p>The moves against the Voting Rights Act also come as Texas and other states separately challenge the legality of racially-based affirmative action programmes in what some lawyers see as a concerted attempt to undermine and even kill off decades of civil rights legislation.</p> <p>The legal assault has zeroed in on a provision of the Voting Rights Act which requires nine states \u2013 Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia \u2013 to seek approval from the US justice department in Washington for changes to voting laws or procedures. Some districts in seven other states are also bound by the legislation.</p> <p>\"There has been a proliferation of cases that aim to take down and rip out this core provision of the Voting Rights Act,\" said Debo Adegbile, acting president and lead counsel of the NAACP legal defence fund, who has argued in the defence of the law at the supreme court. \"I think it's fair to say that the supreme court invited these challenges.\"</p> <p>Several states have taken on the Obama administration over the law with legislation requiring people to produce photo identification to vote, redrawing electoral boundaries and measures limiting voter registration.</p> <p>Obama's justice department has won a series of victories in recent weeks in which federal courts ruled that the changes amounted to racial discrimination and attempts to manipulate elections.</p> <p>Last week, courts in Washington DC separately struck down <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/28/texas-loses-electoral-maps-latinos\">plans by Texas to redraw constituency boundaries</a> because they diminished the impact of a rapidly growing Latino vote and to require photo identification at the polls, which the court said <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/30/texas-battle-voter-id-law\">would discourage minorities from voting</a>.</p> <p>The justice department has won similar victories over changes to election laws and procedures in other states, including Alabama and Florida, and is fighting legislation by South Carolina in a case the Obama administration appears likely to win.</p> <p>But they may prove pyrrhic victories. Several state governments are looking to the conservative-leaning supreme court \u2013 which has already expressed its doubts about racially-based policy \u2013 to challenge the provision of the Voting Rights Act requiring \"pre-clearance\" by the US justice department, known as Section 5.</p> <p>Nathaniel Persily, a Columbia University law professor whose work was cited in earlier supreme court opinion on the issue, said it is only a matter of time before the supreme court strikes at the heart of the Voting Rights Act by limiting the federal government's ability to enforce the legislation.</p> <p>\"The question is not whether Section 5 of the voting rights act will be struck down, but when and how. Will it die a death of a thousand cuts? Or will it be killed with one swift blow?\" he said.</p> <p>Persily said the supreme court hinted at its willingness to declare Section 5 unconstitutional in a 2009 ruling which upheld the Voting Rights Act while laying the seeds of its potential destruction.</p> <p>In that case, officials in Austin, Texas said they should not have to ask Washington's permission to move a polling place from a house to a public school. The supreme court upheld the Voting Rights Act, which was extended for 25 years by large majorities in both houses of Congress in 2006.</p> <p>But the chief justice, John Roberts, raised doubts about whether Section 5 could survive. He said the failure of Congress to update the law to take account of the changes it has brought about \u2013 such as black and white people voting in similar proportions across the south \u2013 raised questions about its constitutionality.</p> <p>\"The south has changed. The evil that Section 5 is meant to address may no longer be concentrated in the jurisdictions singled out for pre-clearance. The statute's coverage formula is based on data that is now more than 35 years old, and there is considerable evidence that it fails to account for current political conditions,\" Roberts wrote.</p> <p>While flagging up his doubts, Roberts said that \"the importance of the question does not justify our rushing to decide it\" \u2013 a view widely read as encouraging further legal challenges to the law so the supreme court can consider the matter at length.</p> <p>The chief justice's comments opened the floodgates. Since the 2009 ruling there have been more legal challenges to Section 5 than in the previous 44 years of its existence. <a href=\"http://www.statesman.com/news/texas-politics/as-texas-voter-id-law-heads-to-hearing-2413543.html\">Texas</a> and Florida have already said they intend to ask to the supreme court to hear their cases. Two weeks ago,<a href=\"http://www.alaskadispatch.com/article/more-alaska-redistricting-litigation-attorney-general-challenges-voting-rights-act-precleara\"> Alaska filed a constitutional challenge</a> to its obligations under Section 5.</p> <p>But the case closest to a hearing is out of an Alabama county, Shelby.</p> <p>The county's legal bills are being paid by the <a href=\"http://www.projectonfairrepresentation.org\">Project on Fair Representation</a>, which describes itself as a legal defence fund fighting \"the creation of racially gerrymandered voting districts\". Its director, Edward Blum, says that Section 5 exceeds Congress's powers under the constitution and that it punishing states for past sins.</p> <p>\"Section 5 was a draconian yet completely necessary provision in 1965 when mostly southern jurisdictions we purposely shutting out blacks from the ballot box. Today, however, Section 5 is no longer a needed remedy and has evolved into a racial gerrymandering tool,\" he said. \"African Americans and Hispanics no longer live in barrios and ghettos. Over the last 40 years, inner city America, which was heavily minority, has emptied out and African Americans and Hispanics live in all corners of these large major metropolitan areas now.\"</p> <p>But Adegbile said that the proliferation of laws being blocked by the justice department and courts under Section 5 is evidence of continued need for the Voting Rights Act. </p> <p>\"Courts with judges appointed by Republican presidents and Democratic presidents are saying these underlying voting changes are discriminatory and will harm minority voters,\" he said. \"What we see is a rash of voting measures targeted at minority voters in a number of places across the country that surprises folks who believed we had moved beyond though practices. I think the average person understands that it seems there's still different ways that you can try to win elections. One is by mobilising your voters. The other is by blocking a certain segment of the electorate and that second approach remains, unfortunately, a technique that is being deployed in too many places around the country.\"</p> <p>The supreme court has also taken up another case, involving race based affirmative action, that potentially has a profound impact on civil rights. Abigail Fisher sued after she was denied a place at the University of Texas claiming that she was discriminated against because she is white.</p> <p>In 2003, a divided supreme court ruled that a student's race could be considered in order to achieve a diverse university student body, but only after attempting to use other means. Fisher argues that Texas law already provides for a diverse admissions policy and therefore race based affirmative action was unnecessary.</p> <p>The Project on Fair Representation is financially backing that legal challenge, too. Blum said that he regards affirmative action based on race as a mistake from the beginning. \"Affirmative action assumed that all African Americans regardless of their family income or their family educational background were deserving of some special help,\" he said.</p> <p>Persily said that if that central part of the Voting Rights Act is struck down then other civil rights legislation is likely to come under legal attack.</p> <p>\"The thing about Section 5 of the voting rights act is that it's been the standard against which all other exercises of federal power in the civil rights realm have been judged. When you're talking about the disabilities act or the age discrimination in employment act or any number of other pieces of legislation, when the courts find problems with those laws they say they're not as good as the voting rights act,\" he said.</p> <p>\"So now the gold standard for civil rights legislation is potentially going to be declared unconstitutional with unclear repercussions for all kinds of other laws.\"</p> <p>Adegbile agrees. \"If the rulings were overly broad, the knock-on effect could be felt in other areas such as employment, education and the like. I think that there are serious threats,\" he said.</p> <p>Blum hopes so, saying that he believes employment laws and public contracting, in which a proportion of government contracts are awarded to minority-owned firms, will be particularly vulnerable to legal challenge.</p> <p>For Adegbile, the looming supreme court battles are a test of where the US stands on civil rights half a century after the laws that changed America.</p> <p>\"Right now we are at a moment where there are competing visions of equality and opportunity in America. One side says that we have to celebrate our progress but recognise that we can do better. The other view is that we should stop talking about our history. We should deny the context, and we should move past all of this as if to pretend that racial discrimination does not continue to exist in America.\"</p>",
  "<h2>The big story</h2> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/04/michael-clarke-duncan-green-mile-dead\">death of Green Mile star Michael Clarke Duncan </a>on Monday sparked off an unexpectedly widespread reaction; the big, genial actor was <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/sep/05/film-world-tribute-michael-clarke-duncan\">held in high esteem by his peers</a> and the film world was shocked by his early demise, at only 54. Though it's fair to say Duncan's impact as an actor had diminished of late, the response demonstrated the enduring power of cinema stardom. Though he only had a single really successful role - that of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2012/sep/04/michael-clarke-duncan-career-clips\">the convict with extraordinary healing powers</a>, in a Stephen King's adaptation \u2013 and that well over a decade ago, its impact ensured that Duncan was elevated permanently in the public's affection. He <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/sep/04/michael-clarke-duncan\">never had another role to match it</a> (a couple of comic turns in action movies like Armageddon and Daredevil aside), but all of Hollywood felt his loss.</p> <h2>In the news</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395756307\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/8/31/1346433901216/Shia-LaBeouf--003.jpg\" alt=\"Shia LaBeouf \" width=\"140\" height=\"84\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shia LaBeouf \u2026 with his clothes on.

  "<p>Private businesses added 201,000 jobs in August, far more than expected and a positive sign before Friday's release of the US government's monthly jobs tally.</p> <p>According to the latest report from payroll processor Automatic Data Processing (ADP) and consultancy Macroeconomic Advisers, the jobs market achieved its biggest gain in five months in August, easily beating economists' forecasts. ADP also increased July's estimated jobs gain from 163,000 to 173,000.</p> <p>On Friday the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) will release its latest nonfarm payroll data, a closely watched tally of government as well as private sector jobs.</p> <p>The nonfarm payroll figures have become a monthly flashpoint in the 2012 election and few are likely to receive as much attention as Friday's, which will follow president Barack Obama's closing speech at the Democratic convention in Charlotte.</p> <p>Last month ADP's figures matched the nonfarm figures almost exactly but overall they have proven to be a spotty guide to the BLS numbers, which include government jobs, which have been heavily cut in recent years. Economists polled by Reuters are predicting nonfarm payrolls increased by 125,000 in August.</p> <p>The ADP survey comes amid other signs that suggest a pick up in the labour market. Initial jobless claims fell back to 365,000 last week, from 377,000 and employers' plans to lay off staff dropped to a 20-month low in August, according to the latest survey by consultant Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas.</p> <p>Paul Ashworth, chief US economist at Capital Economics said his forecast of 100,000 new jobs for Friday's nonfarm payrolls was now looking \"pessimistic\".</p> <p>But in a note to clients he said the jobs news was unlikely to take the pressure off Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke to act. In a speech last week, Bernanke described the state of the US economy as \"far from satisfactory\" and said the still high rate of unemployment could \"wreak structural damage on our economy that could last for many years\". Bernanke indicated the Fed was preparing to act to stimulate the economy.</p> <p>\"More generally, we wouldn't expect this improvement to persuade the Fed to hold fire next week. Employment would need to grow by a lot more than 200,000 per month to bring the unemployment rate down at a pace more agreeable to the Fed,\" said Ashworth.</p>",
  "<p>He would not be everyone's first choice as an ambassador for Africa in outer space.

But sceptics question whether a continental body in the mould of Nasa or the European Space Agency would merely add bureaucracy and financial burdens that the world's poorest continent can ill afford.</p> <p>A working document issued for the conference in Khartoum says the agency, called AfriSpace, would enable \"co-operation among African states in space research and technology and their space applications\".</p> <p>Only \"a tiny minority\" of countries presently control space technologies, which play a major role in everything from broadcasting to weather forecasting, agriculture, health and environmental monitoring, the document notes.</p> <p>\"A common continental approach will allow the sharing of risks and costs and ensure the availability of skilled and sufficient human resources. It will also ensure a critical size of geographical area and population required in terms of the plan of action for some space applications.\"</p> <p>AfriSpace would implement a long-term African space policy, recommend \"space objectives\" to member states and co-ordinate orbital slots and other space resources, the document adds.</p> <p>Co-operation on space would be a notable breakthrough for a continent where political and trade barriers remain notoriously obstructive. It is hoped there would be spin-offs in terms of employment, skills and new technologies.</p> <p>But <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sarahemilywild\" title=\"\">Sarah Wild</a>, a South African science journalist, said: \"South Africa took years to get its own space agency up and running. It takes time and money. Personally I think an African space agency is a bit of a pie in the sky idea. I'd be interested to see where they get the resources and skills.\"</p> <p>Wild, the author of Searching African Skies, added: \"Africa needs space projects but I think rather than the pomp and circumstance of an agency they should concentrate resources on projects that are already there.\"</p> <p>The plan has also run into trouble over its proposed name. The <a href=\"http://www.afrispace.org\" title=\"\">African Space Institute posted a message on its website</a> stating: \"It has come to our attention that the African Union are trying to make use of the name 'AfriSpace' for their African space agency.</p> <p>\"AfriSpace has been in use by the African Space Institute and Orbital Horizon since 2009 and we are the rightful users as well as recognised stakeholders in the space sector. We have requested a response from them on this matter and have offered to discuss further regarding the use of our used name.\"</p> <p>Africa is no newcomer to stargazing.

  "<p>Over the past month, the Republican party's woman problem has come to the fore. And justifiably so: the party doesn't take too kindly to the needs and rights of women \u2013 or to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/20/us/politics/todd-akin-provokes-ire-with-legitimate-rape-comment.html\">basic reproductive science</a> \u2013 and it's <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18563_162-57506101/womens-vote-hinges-on-social-issues-pocketbook/\">weighing on Mitt Romney's candidacy</a>.</p> <p>But party leaders' backward ideas aren't limited to controlling women's bodies; they also extend to controlling paychecks. With equal pay activist <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/lilly-ledbetter-addresses-democratic-national-convention-on-workplace-equality-for-women/2012/09/04/6d3a6f8a-f6fc-11e1-a93b-7185e3f88849_story.html\">Lilly Ledbetter helping kick off</a> the Democratic National Convention this week, it's time voters focused more on this equally important front in the Republican war on women. </p> <p>Nearly 50 years after the passage of the <a href=\"http://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/equalcompensation.cfm\">Equal Pay Act</a> \u2013 the civil rights-era law requiring that employers pay women the same as men for performing the same work \u2013 women are still losing out. American women who work full-time, year-round are paid <a href=\"http://www.nwlc.org/resource/women-cant-afford-unfair-pay-today\">only 77 cents for every dollar paid</a> to their male counterparts. The <a href=\"http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/mapping-the-glass-ceiling/\">average college-educated man's annual salary maxes out at age 48 at $95,000</a>, whereas the average college-educated woman's does so at $60,000, at age 39. </p> <p>What do Republican party leaders propose we do about this persistent pay gap: a disparity that's unfair on its face and that <a href=\"http://www.nwlc.org/resource/women-cant-afford-unfair-pay-today\">costs American families thousands of dollars</a> every year? Nothing. </p> <p>Take the Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, which makes it easier for women to challenge unequal pay by allowing them more time to file lawsuits against their employers. The act is named after aforementioned Lilly Ledbetter, a former Goodyear Tire manager who sued after finding out she was paid about $13,000 less per year than male colleagues doing the same work. Romney has been <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/13/mitt-romney-paul-ryan_n_1773193.html\">characteristically unclear on his stance</a> on the law, but running-mate Paul Ryan voted against the bill in 2009, along with more than 200 other Republican members of Congress. </p> <p>In June, Republicans united to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/06/us/politics/senate-republicans-block-pay-equity-bill.html\">block the Paycheck Fairness Act</a>, which would allow for punitive damages for pay discrimination and bar companies from retaliating against workers who inquire about pay disparities or discuss their pay with co-workers. You'd think such a libertarian ideal \u2013 protecting free speech \u2013 would be right up Paul Ryan's alley. But according to the Republican mentality, it seems the right to free speech only counts when it comes to corporate donors and fertilized eggs.</p> <p>Republican leaders aren't just opposed to explicitly pay-oriented policies; they also don't want to allow women with deflated paychecks to access more affordable healthcare. Romney and Ryan want to repeal Obama's healthcare law, which guarantees annual exams for women and mammograms for those over 40 at no additional cost. Ryan also <a href=\"http://www.prochoiceamerica.org/assets/download-files/rep-paul-ryan-r-wi-profile.pdf\">voted to defund Planned Parenthood four times</a>, and his budget <a href=\"http://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/elections-politics/womens-health-budget-1154.htm\">would eliminate funding for access to birth control</a>, and STD and cancer screenings, for low-income families. </p> <p>It's true that the equal pay laws we already have on the books \u2013 the Equal Pay Act, the Ledbetter Act and Title VII protections \u2013 are solid. But considering the size and persistence of the pay gap, it's clear that existing laws need to be strengthened and enforced, and more protections are needed for those who speak up about basic workplace fairness. </p> <p>Still, Republicans prefer to do nothing.</p> <p>Especially in a down economy, employees are afraid to point out problems at work for fear of being fired or otherwise retaliated against. In many workplaces, discussing pay is taboo; in some, it's grounds for termination.</p> <p>Employees' reticence to assert their rights likely explains why there were fewer cases charging sex-based wage discrimination last year than the year before the Ledbetter Act was signed, and why the wage gap <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-14/obama-pitches-equal-pay-to-win-women-even-as-charges-drop.html\">was slightly wider in 2010</a> than it was in 2007. Obama's EEOC (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission) has also brought just six discrimination cases from 2009 to 2011 \u2013 one third the number it handled between 2006 and 2008.</p> <p>Distressingly, the gender pay disparity has barely budged in more than a decade, <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-06-21/equal-pay-plaintiffs-burden-of-proof\">according to Bloomberg BusinessWeek</a>. It was about 40 cents to the dollar in the early 1960s, and narrowed quickly in the 1980s and early 90s. But it has shrunk by only four cents since 1994, and less than one cent since 2005, even as younger women caught up with and surpassed men in education. </p> <p>Republican leaders and their backers in the US Chamber of Commerce claim that laws like the Paycheck Fairness Act <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0612/77069_Page2.html\">would lead to \"frivolous\" lawsuits</a>. But it's the job of the courts, not lobbyists, to decide which lawsuits should be allowed to move forward. Republicans also claim that Democrats were using the act as an election-year ploy to appeal to women. That's not much of an argument: if political opportunism results in better policy platforms and stronger laws, I'm all for it.</p> <p>Of course, the pay gap has a number of causes, and a single new law can't correct them overnight. Women are paid less because of discrimination by employers, because of the fact that women dominate lower-paying \"pink collar\" fields like education, caregiving and social service, and because of a lack of protections for women who take time off to give birth and care for a child. </p> <p>But entrenched problems call for creative solutions. Protecting workers who speak up about pay is one of them, and opening the floodgates to this kind of information-sharing would accelerate progress. Why not also require that employers disclose pay scales to bring transparency to compensation \u2013 which is too often based on biased or arbitrary decisions? </p> <p>The Republican party will have none of it. But as its candidates remain wilfully blind to pay disparities and possible solutions, they're creating a political gender gap that not even <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/video/ann-romneys-best-moments-2012-republican-national-convention-17101826\">Ann Romney's love</a> can close.</p>",
  "<p>Randu Nzai Ruwa is no stereotypical revolutionary. But the soft-spoken carpenter has a radical idea \u2013 he wants independence for Kenya's Indian Ocean coast, a paradise for visitors where locals live in poverty.</p> <p>Ruwa is the leader of the Mombasa Republican Council (MRC), a secessionist group outlawed by the Kenyan government in 2010 but unbanned by the courts in July.</p> <p>He says the government is neglecting the region, and complains that jobs, land and resources go to outsiders from the rest of Kenya, known as <em>wabara</em>. \"We have been made slaves in our own land,\" Ruwa says in a scruffy, noisy room in Mombasa, the country's second-largest city.</p> <p>The movement is just the latest \u2013 in a continent splintered by separatist disputes, some longstanding, others more recent \u2013 to challenge the notoriously arbitrary borders drawn by European colonisers in the 1880s with little regard for ethnicity, culture and religion.</p> <p>From western Sahara and Casamance in west Africa to Puntland in Somalia and Matabeleland in Zimbabwe, Africa has more than 20 independence movements, some of which will have been encouraged by the recent experience of South Sudan, which broke away from Sudan last year.</p> <p>In post-Gaddafi Libya, the east around Benghazi is notably restive. Ethiopia has two long-running separatist movements in Ogaden and Oromia. Zanzibar, merged with Tanganyika almost 50 years ago into Tanzania, is now hearing Islamists call for a referendum on ending the union.</p> <p>Portrayed as a palm-fringed paradise in tourist brochures, Kenya's coast suffers from crippling poverty and unemployment. The region's wealth exacerbates frustrations: tourist resorts bring in millions of dollars each year and Mombasa's port is the gateway to east Africa for goods from around the world.</p> <p>Mombasa and the surrounding region have <a href=\"http://www.mombasainfo.com/about-mombasa/history-culture/history-of-mombasa/\" title=\"\">a distinct heritage</a> garnered from centuries of Arab trade and influence \u2013 the pungent smell of the spices traded centuries ago still perfume the Old Town's narrow winding streets.</p> <p>The Portuguese dominated the region for about 200 years from the late 15th century, before they were overthrown by the Omani Arabs, who then ceded control of the region to the British.</p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Mombasa-Republican-Council-MRC/148508195220835\" title=\"\">council</a>, which says it has more than 2 million members, argues that the British protectorate should never have been integrated into Kenya at independence. Its Kiswahili slogan is <em>\"Pwani si Kenya\"</em> (\"the coast is not Kenya\").</p> <p>Ruwa believes the Mombasa region has a strong case for independence, backed by historical documents. Kenyan authorities say the documents are false.</p> <p>Although most analysts believe secession will never happen, they say Ruwa's movement could play a significant role as Kenya prepares for elections next March, five years after around 1,200 people were killed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jan/28/kenya.international\" title=\"\">in tribal violence after a disputed poll</a>.</p> <p>The organisation wants its supporters to boycott the March vote, and Ruwa says many of its people are losing patience. \"It is like a time bomb,\" he said. \"All the youth want to fight with the government \u2026 We are just cooling them down.\"</p> <p>Suleiman Shahbal, a businessman campaigning for election as Mombasa's governor, acknowledges the appeal of independence. \"A lot of people at the coast feel the electoral process has failed us \u2026 That has led to the frustration that you are now seeing epitomised by the MRC,\" he said.</p> <p>One of the most festering issues is land. Much of the best property at the coast is owned by people from other parts of Kenya \u2013 a result, the MRC says, of land-grabbing by Kenya's first president after independence, Jomo Kenyatta. The group says even the jobs created by the <em>wabara</em>, go to <em>wabara</em>.</p> <p>Kenyan officials have linked the separatists to militant groups such as Somalia's Islamist al-Shabaab. But Ruwa denies the allegations and a November 2011 <a href=\"http://www.kecosce.org/downloads/MRC_Conflict_Assessment_Threats_and_Opportunities_for_Engagement.pdf\" title=\"\">study of the movement</a> (pdf), by a researcher, Paul Goldsmith, found no evidence of an official armed wing \u2013 yet.</p> <p>\"The MRC is not armed but could easily become so in the future,\" Goldsmith wrote, adding there were reports of some units undergoing rudimentary military-style training.</p> <p>He also said some of the <em>wabara</em> were reportedly arming themselves. \"The potential for violence, however, should be viewed as largely independent of the MRC campaign \u2026 engaging the MRC is arguably one of the best opportunities for preventing bloodshed on the coast.\"</p> <p>In Mombasa, tensions are already rising. Take Ali, who is sitting in the shade in the middle of a Mombasa day, killing time because he has no job. \"There are so many people around the coast, especially the tribes of the coast, who are jobless,\" he said, declaring his support for independence. \"If you have 90% jobless, what's next? It's war.\"</p>",
  "<p>Just off the main road through West Jerusalem toward Bethlehem sits a prime but barren piece of real estate surrounded by luxury flats.</p> <p>It's the site of a future American embassy to Israel that, for nearly two decades, the US Congress has demanded be built immediately. But once American presidents begin navigating the minefield of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, they quickly realise they don't need to add to their problems by shifting the US embassy from Tel Aviv - a unilateral statement on the status of Jerusalem.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/post/democrats-forced-to-reverse-platform-language-on-jerusalem/2012/09/05/af23a672-f79d-11e1-8398-0327ab83ab91_blog.html\">Just how sensitive the issue of Jerusalem is was laid bare at the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday</a> when, fearing accusations of not being pro-Israel enough, the party leadership hurriedly revived a clause in the platform from previous years proclaiming the city as the Jewish state's capital when much of the rest of the world withholds recognition. The DNC also said Jerusalem should be an \"undivided city\", while contradicting itself by adding that the issue is subject to negotiation with the Palestinians, who claim occupied East Jerusalem as their own capital.</p> <p>That's exactly what the Democratic party platform said when Barack Obama was elected in 2008. But as president, he has not done any more than his predecessors to act on the vexed issue of the embassy.</p> <p>It's a reflection of the split US stance toward Israel that Congress and political parties are given to highly partisan declarations of support for the Jewish state, driven by domestic politics and a powerful lobby, while presidents are forced to maintain the pretence of neutral arbiter in the diplomatic machinations that have failed to deliver an end to occupation and a free Palestinian state.</p> <p>At the heart of the fuss at the DNC is Israel's demand that the world recognise all of Jerusalem as its capital.</p> <p>Although it's evident that functionally the city is the Jewish state's capital, even close allies such as Britain say that to give formal recognition would be to legitimise the Israeli occupation of East Jerusalem when talks with Palestinians are meant to decide its status, even if an agreement looks a distant prospect. So most countries, including the US, keep their embassies in Tel Aviv and generally speak about Jerusalem as the seat of the Israeli government.</p> <p>But the US Congress has taken a contrary position \u2013 in its enthusiasm to be as pro-Israel as possible. In 1995, the Republican-led Congress passed a law requiring the US embassy to be moved to Jerusalem by 1999. President Bill Clinton declined to do so as he attempted to shepherd Yasser Arafat and various Israeli leaders toward a deal. George W Bush attacked Clinton for it.</p> <p>\"As soon as I take office I will begin the process of moving the US ambassador to the city Israel has chosen as its capital,\" he told the pro-Israel lobby in 2000.</p> <p>The Republican party election platform made an explicit commitment to move the embassy. But once Bush was in the White House, he, too, failed to make the move.</p> <p>In 2008, as Barack Obama ran for president, the Democratic party platform said:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Jerusalem is and will remain the capital of Israel. The parties have agreed that Jerusalem is a matter for final status negotiations. It should remain an undivided city accessible to people of all faiths.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The then presidential candidate said he recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital. But, like his predecessors, Obama has declined to act on the 1995 law in the face of other Middle Eastern realities, not least the repercussions in a changing Arab world.</p> <p>In July, the White House spokesman, Jay Carney, would not be drawn on what the capital of Israel is. The US state department has for years fought lawsuits over its refusal to enter \"Jerusalem, Israel\" as a place of birth on American passports, even though Congress has passed a law saying it must.</p> <p>Sane diplomatic positions pertain while the future of the city remains unresolved. But now, it's election season \u2013 and what matters is the loyalty test.</p> <p>It's not clear how the routine commitment to an undivided Jerusalem as the Israeli capital got dropped from this year's Democratic party platform, but Obama was worried enough, not least about votes in knife-edge Florida which has a significant Jewish electorate, to intervene and get it reinstated.</p> <p>Mitt Romney \u2013 playing not only to part of the Jewish vote (which will mostly go to Obama), but as much to a larger Christian fundamentalist constituency solid in its support of Israel \u2013 quickly sought to capitalise on the debacle by again suggesting Obama is not truly committed. It's not the first time Romney has played the Jerusalem card. In June, he told CNN he would like to move the US embassy to the city. But the Republican presidential contender tried to give himself an out by saying that he \"would only want to do so and to select the timing in accordance with the government of Israel\". Well, Israel would like it to happen yesterday.</p> <p>If Romney is elected, he's not likely to shift from the position of his three predecessors, which is that it's not in the US's interest to move its embassy to Jerusalem any time soon. Which leaves congressional declarations, party commitments and the fleeting controversy over the Democratic platform as nothing more than noise \u2013 which is all about US politics, not Middle East peace.</p> <p>What that really highlights is the lack of any real discussion in this election of what needs to be done to reach an agreement on Jerusalem and bring about a Palestinian state.</p> <p>\u2022 Commenting on this article will be on for 24 hours and may be turned off overnight</p>",
  "<p>A professor who claims he was fired from his job at New York University after giving James Franco a \"D\" is to sue his former student for defamation.</p> <p>Jos\u00e9 Angel Santana, who is already engaged in legal action against his former employer, has now filed a civil action in the Manhattan supreme court over comments Franco made labelling his classes \"awful\". He says he handed out the low grade because the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/137863/127-hours\" title=\"\">127 Hours</a> star attended just two out of his 14 scheduled directing classes.</p> <p>\"Whoever was in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/aug/31/clint-eastwood-chair-speech-romney\" title=\"\">Clint Eastwood's chair at the Republican national convention</a> was more present than Mr Franco was in my classes,\" Santana told the New York Post. <a href=\"http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/zzzz_money_GpWMiEBVLr9hGLrZFrYgiM?utm_source=SFnewyorkpost&amp;utm_medium=SFnewyorkpost\" title=\"\">\"[Franco] uses the bully pulpit of his celebrity to punish anyone who doesn't do his bidding.\"</a></p> <p>The offending comments were made during interviews for Franco's film The Broken Tower in April. He told reporters Santana was \"awful,\" adding: \"I didn't feel like I needed to waste my time with a bad teacher.\"</p> <p>\"No teacher will ever be fired from NYU for giving a student a D,\" added the actor. <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/16/james-franco-explains-why-skipped-nyu-class_n_1428281.html#s268292&amp;title=UCLA\" title=\"\">\"He wasn't fired, he was asked not to come back after three years because they didn't think he was a good teacher. He is not going to be hired at another institution.\" </a></p> <p>But Santana, who has been been a teacher since 1979 and was earning $70,000 (\u00a344,000) prior to being let go by the university, said he had \"overwhelmingly positive student evaluations\". He said: \"I didn't deserve to be on the receiving end of those falsehoods. I was outraged that someone with his attendance record at NYU had the audacity to make those statements.\"</p> <p>Santana, who taught as an assistant arts professor on the actor's graduate film course, also said he was simply doing his job by handing Franco a low grade, in contrast with other professors, who \"bent over backwards to create a Franco-friendly environment\".</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/dec/20/james-franco-lawsuit-nyu-professor\" title=\"\">The teacher filed a lawsuit against New York University</a> in December 2011 in protest at his dismissal, claiming that Franco received good grades from his former colleagues despite similar levels of absence from their lectures. These, Santana alleged, were in return for the publicity the actor's enrolment brought the school and because the actor had collaborated with faculty members on independent film projects.</p>",
  "<p>Say what you want about Bill Clinton \u2013 and people do \u2013 but he gives good convention. And so he should. The last time he didn't address a convention was 1984. He knows which delegates' buttons to press because he sewed so many of them on himself.</p> <p>Last night, in a long, always spirited and occasionally rambling performance, he reminded the country not just who the good guy is but where the bad times came from.</p> <p>\"In Tampa the Republican argument against Obama's re-election was pretty simple, pretty snappy: 'We left him a total mess, he hasn't finished cleaning it up fast enough, so fire him and put us back in.' I like the argument for President Obama's re-election a whole lot better. He inherited a deeply damaged economy, put a floor under the crash, began the long hard road to recovery and laid the foundation for a modern, more well-balanced economy.\"</p> <p>It was a full-throated, at times light-hearted, rousing endorsement of the man who beat his wife in a bitter primary four years ago. Bill Clinton sauntered on stage to his 1992 campaign song: \"Don't stop thinking about tomorrow.\" But the convention hall \u2013 clinging to him like a cross-generational comfort blanket \u2013 were thinking about two decades ago, a reassuring reminder of what seems like a bygone era when jobs were many, you could get on a plane without first taking off your shoes and white southern Democrats weren't virtually extinct.</p> <p>His appearance in a primetime slot usually reserved for vice-presidents says more about Obama's vulnerabilities than it does about Clinton's strengths. And those weaknesses have been clear during this convention.</p> <p>While there is far more enthusiasm in Charlotte than there was among Republicans in Tampa last week, that exuberance among Democrats is far less focused. Republicans trained their sights on the economy, deceptively at times but relentlessly throughout. The Democratic rhetorical fire, however, is dispersed among many targets. Women's rights, union rights, equality of opportunity, healthcare reform, gay marriage, student debt \u2013 all get shout outs, all get cheers. There is a theme \u2013 fairness \u2013 but there isn't a coherent message beyond the threat that under Mitt Romney the country will be less fair.</p> <p>This is where Clinton comes in. For the problem is not that Barack Obama does not have a record. It's that the record he has does not include the single most important achievement he could hope for: improving the lot of the broad swathe of middle America. It's the one area where voters trust Romney more than him and by far the most important issue in the election.</p> <p>Clinton bears the imprimatur of economic success. Long after the Monica Lewinsky scandal, Don't Ask Don't Tell, the North American Free Trade Agreement, welfare reform, the repeal of the Glass-Steagall act and the defence of marriage act are forgotten, the memory of a strong economy and a budget surplus on his watch will remain. When the speech was over, Obama came on stage and hugged him as though he were a life raft.</p>",

The delegates, who cheered and applauded throughout the speech, chanted: \"We are fired up.\"</p> <p>The image of that valedictory moment will be pushed hard by the Obama campaign. Clinton reaches parts of the Democratic party and independents that the president struggles with: white male working-class voters in particular.</p> <p>He formally nominated Obama as the party's presidential nominee and that was confirmed later in a roll call of delegates.</p> <p>Clinton's 48-minute speech combined folksy ad-libs with a detail-packed, point-by-point rebuttal of Republican attacks on Obama's record. \"We simply cannot afford to give the reins of government to someone who will double down on trickledown,\" Clinton said</p> <p>It was also a powerful positive argument for re-electing Obama to finish the job of securing recovery, a task Clinton said neither he nor any other president could have delivered in just four years.</p> <p>\"President Obama started with a much weaker economy than I did,\" said Clinton. \"No president \u2013 not me or any of my predecessors \u2013 could have repaired all the damage in just four years. But conditions are improving and if you'll renew the president's contract you will feel it. I believe that with all my heart.\"</p> <p>The speech offers the Obama team a clear blueprint for the next two months of campaigning \u2013 their messages over the last few months have been confused at times as they struggled to articulate a coherent case for re-election.</p> <p>In a week that has seen the Obama campaign grapple unconvincingly with the question \"Are voters better off than four years ago?\", Clinton had an unequivocal response.&#xa0;</p> <p>\"Now, are we where we want to be today? No. Is the president satisfied? Of course not. But are we better off than we were when he took office? ... The answer is yes.\"</p> <p>Since 1961, Clinton said, Democrats had held power for 24 years, the Republicans 28, and the economy had created 66m private sector jobs in that period. \"So what's the job score? Republicans, 24 million; Democrats, 42 [million],\" he said.</p> <p>Clinton \u2013 much thinner a year after announcing he was becoming a vegan for health reasons \u2013 demonstrated again why he is the biggest draw in the Democratic party and the 23,000-seater arena was filled to capacity to hear him formally nominate Obama for re-election.</p> <p>It is a long way from 2008 when Clinton made many bitter remarks about Obama during the campaign by his wife, Hillary, for the Democratic presidential nomination, and Obama campaign officials branded the former president a racist. Even the most diehard member of Obama's inner circle, where there is still lingering animosity from four years ago,&#xa0;would find it hard to say that Clinton did not deliver on the night for his successor.&#xa0;</p> <p>\"I want to nominate a man who ran for president to change the course of an already weak economy and then just six weeks before his election, saw it suffer the biggest collapse since the Great Depression ... I want to nominate a man who's cool on the outside but who burns for America on the inside,\" Clinton said.</p> <p>He added, to loud cheers that won another standing ovation, if mainly for the first lady who spoke powerfully the night before: \"And by the way, after last night I want a man who had the good sense to marry Michelle Obama.\"&#xa0;</p> <p>Clinton rebutted Republican attack after attack mounted against Obama over healthcare, debt, the car industry bailout and economic management.</p> <p>The president, he said, contrary to accusations by the Republicans, had sought to work with the other side in Congress but had been repeatedly rebuffed. His instinct was towards co-operation. \"Obama appointed several members of his cabinet even though they supported Hillary. Heck, he even appointed Hillary,\" he said, his best joke of the night.</p> <p>The core of his speech dealt with the ideological divide between the parties.\"My fellow Americans, all of us in this grand hall and everybody watching at home, when we vote in this election we'll be deciding what kind of country we want to live in. If you want a winner take all, you're on your own society you should support the Republican ticket. But if you want a country of shared opportunities and shared responsibility, a we're all in this together society, you should vote for Barack Obama and Joe Biden.\"</p> <p>Clinton's presidency coincided with a period of economic boom and part of his popularity stems for a nostalgia for that period. He was dismissive of Republican nominee Mitt Romney's claims, outlined last week at the Republican convention in Tampa, Florida, that he would deliver speedier economic recovery.&#xa0;</p> <p>\"Now I &#xa0;like the argument for President Obama's re-election a lot better. Here it is. He inherited a deeply damaged economy. He put a floor under the crash. He began the long hard road to recovery and laid the foundation for a modern, more well-balanced economy that will produce millions of good new jobs, vibrant new businesses and lots of new wealth for innovators.\"</p> <p>Clinton's primetime appearance lifted party spirits after a day of setbacks. Obama's plan to make his nomination speech in an open-air 73,000-seater football stadium near the convention had to be abandoned because of fears of a thunderstorm.&#xa0;</p> <p>Worse was to come in the afternoon in a self-inflicted row among Democrats over the party's policy on the status of Jerusalem. On Tuesday it emerged that a statement declaring Jerusalem the capital of Israel had been removed from the platform, sparking 24 hours of furious criticism from pro-Israel groups and Republicans.</p> <p>Yesterday Obama personally intervened in an attempt to close down the issue by reinserting the line into the platform, a move that brought booing from the convention floor.</p> <p>That the delegates are more deeply liberal than the party in general was demonstrated with the rapturous reception for Elizabeth Warren, the party's Senate candidate in Massachusetts. Warren has been one of the leading critics of Wall Street and hit the theme again on Wednesday night.</p> <p>\"People feel like the system is rigged against them. And here's the painful part: they're right. The system is rigged. Look around. Oil companies guzzle down billions in subsidies. Billionaires pay lower tax rates than their secretaries. Wall Street CEOs \u2013 the same ones who wrecked our economy and destroyed millions of jobs \u2013 still strut around Congress, no shame, demanding favours and acting like we should thank them.&#xa0;Anyone here have a problem with that? Well I do.\"</p> <p>She was given the warm-up spot for Clinton, a sign of the importance of her campaign in Massachusetts. A win in the traditionally Democratic state would help the party hold on to its majority in the Senate.</p> <p>Another stand-out speaker at the conference was Sandra Fluke, who had been described as a \"slut\" by the conservative talk-show host Rush Limbaugh when she spoke about contraception at a congressional hearing.</p> <p>\"Our president, when he hears a young woman has been verbally attacked, thinks of his daughters \u2013 not his delegates or donors \u2013 and stands with all women,\" she said. \"And strangers come together, reach out and lift her up. And then, instead of trying to silence her, you invite me here \u2013 and give me a microphone \u2013 to amplify our voice. That's the difference.\"</p>",
  "<p>Benita Veliz, a young Hispanic \"Dreamer\" from San Antonio in Texas, struck a blow for immigrant rights when she became the first undocumented person to address a national political convention.</p> <p>Veliz \u2013 Benny to friends \u2013 openly and unashamedly proclaimed her unauthorised status in front of millions of American TV viewers. She told them she was brought to the US from Mexico as a child and has lived here ever since.</p> <p>She graduated at the top of her class aged 16 and went on to earn a double major four years later. \"I know I have something to contribute to the economy and my country, and I feel just as American as any of my friends or neighbours.\"</p> <p>In 2009 Veliz came close to being deported back to Mexico after she came into the Texas authorities' purview for a minor traffic violation. \"I've had to live almost my entire life knowing I could be deported because of the way I came here,\" she told the convention.</p> <p>Veliz is one of thousands of Hispanics aged 15 to 30 who will be able to take advantage of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/15/obama-stop-deportation-undocumented-immigrants\">executive order declared by President Obama in June</a>. The deferred action order, dubbed \"dream relief\", will allow young undocumented immigrants to put off the threat of deportation for two years to allow them to pursue studies and work opportunities.</p> <p>\"President Obama fought for the Dream Act to help people like me,\" said Velix, who is now studying at St Mary's university in San Antonio. \"When Congress refused to support it, he didn't give up.\"</p> <p>Veliz's audacious appearance in front of millions of Americans is the most high-profile example yet of a growing determination on the part of young undocumented Hispanics to come out of the shadows and announce themselves as a proud part of the American family. Some 11 million people are living in America without permission, about 60% of whom are of Mexican origin.</p> <p>Her address is the second time in two days that the Texan city of San Antonio, the seventh most populous city in the US, was put on the map at the convention. On Tuesday the city's mayor, Julian Castro, delivered the keynote speech.</p> <p>The euphoria among immigrant groups surrounding Veliz's address was dampened a little by news out of Arizona that broke just a couple of hours earlier. A federal judge gave the green light to the most controversial part of the notorious SB 1070 law \u2013 the clause dubbed the \"show me your papers\" provision \u2013 that instructs police to investigate the immigration status of anyone they deem suspicious of being undocumented who they come across in the course of other policing matters.</p> <p>SB 1070 was signed into law in 2010 but quickly put on ice following legal challenges that pushed the law up to the US supreme court. It unleashed a storm of hostile measures directed against undocumented immigrants that swept across Southern legislatures.</p> <p>Alabama, Georgia, Indiana, South Carolina and Utah all scrambled to follow Arizona's example. In turn, those anti-illegal immigration laws provided the inspiration for Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential challenger, who advocated the \"self-deportation\" of millions of people.</p> <p>It is not known precisely when the \"show me your papers\" law will now come into effect in Arizona, but it is expected to be within the next two weeks. When SB 1070 was first introduced <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/18/hispanics-flee-arizona-immigration-law\">it led to virtual panic </a>among unauthorised Hispanic families, with thousands fleeing the state.</p>",
