  "<p>America is the great melting-pot. We all come from distinct backgrounds, and yet we all come together to cast our vote for president on election day. It would be silly to think, however, that we leave our backgrounds outside the polling booth.</p> <p>Four years ago, then-candidate Obama said he could heal the divisions of our country. Those who know anything about voting pattern demographics were suspicious that Obama could accomplish this goal. With this year's election close at hand, we can now see if the president has come closer to reaching his objective.</p> <p>The polls indicate that voting divisions for this year's presidential race have either not closed or have actually expanded to near-record extents.</p> <p><strong>1). The age gap</strong></p> <p>In 2008, those <a href=\"http://elections.nytimes.com/2008/results/president/national-exit-polls.html\">60 years and older</a> supported John McCain by a 4-point margin, while those 18-29 voted for Obama by a 34-point margin. This 38-point age gap was the largest gap since exit polls were first taken in 1972.</p> <p>It would probably surprise you to learn that the age gap is a relatively recent phenomenon. There was no relation between age and voting patterns in 1992, for instance. Today, the Greatest Generation has been replaced by the much more conservative \"silent generation\". Today's younger voters are 40% non-white, a core Democratic group, and those who are white grew up during the Bush years.</p> <p>The result is that the age gap is larger today than it was even four years ago. A recent <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/polls/politico-george-washington-university-battleground-poll.html\">GWU/Battleground Politico poll</a> has Obama holding a large 24-point lead among 18-29 year-olds, and trailing among those 60-plus by 18 points. </p> <p><strong>2). The ideology gap</strong></p> <p>The voting choice differences between self-identified moderate and conservatives has been growing in recent years from 44 points in 1976, to 75 points in 2000. Many Republican leaners who identified as moderate have shifted to the conservative column. Thus, conservatives have been becoming a larger part of the electorate, while moderates, as a group, have become more Democratic in their voting choice.</p> <p>The 69-point division in 2008 between moderates and conservatives was the smallest it had been since 1992. Moderates supported Obama by 21 points, as conservatives gave a 48-point margin to John McCain. This was a big drop from 2004 when the gap was a staggering 78 points.</p> <p>This year, it looks like the ideological disparity is reverting back to where it had been between 1996 and 2004. The <a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2012/10/08/romneys-strong-debate-performance-erases-obamas-lead/\">latest Pew poll</a> has conservatives with Romney by a 52-point margin and moderates with Obama by a 20-point margin \u2013 a 72-point divergence.</p> <p><strong>3). The union gap</strong></p> <p>There are few things that create a fission between Democrats and Republicans more than unions. Most Democrats like unions because they feel they give the working men and women of America the opportunity to come together to fight for better wages. Most Republicans dislike unions because they feel they allow substandard workers to keep their jobs and union bosses to steal money away from employees.</p> <p>The election in 2008 was surprising in that <a href=\"http://ropercenter.uconn.edu/elections/presidential/presidential_election.html#.UIhCVxyXPdw\">both union and non-union households</a> supported Obama. Union voters did so in greater numbers, at 20 points, yet the difference in margin between union and non-union households was only 16 points. This reversed a divide that had grown from only 20 points in 1976 to nearly 30 points between the late 90s and early 2000s.</p> <p>The margin difference in a recent GWU/Battleground Political poll was up to 24 percentage points. It could be that many of the <a href=\"http://www.tnr.com/blog/electionate/108955/the-south-isnt-responsible-obamas-weak-national-poll-numbers\">non-union workers in northeastern states</a> are abandoning Obama. Indeed, union support for Obama was as high in the recent GWU/Battleground poll as it was in the 2008 exit polls.</p> <p><strong>4). The gender gap</strong></p> <p>Since <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2012/01/the_gender_gap_in_politics_why_do_women_vote_differently_than_men_.html\"> the dawn of Reagan</a>, men have drifted into the Republican column with more regularity. Men are more likely to support the hawkish national security stance of the Republican party, and women tend to be more in favor of government-aid social programs championed by Democrats.</p> <p>The difference between men's and women's voting choice in 2008 was actually the second smallest it had been since 1976; 2012 looks a lot different.</p> <p>An <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/21/gender-gap-near-historic-highs/\">average of recent polls</a> showed that women were slated to vote for the president by a 9-point margin, and men were going to vote for Romney by a 9-point margin. Obama's edge among women is largely the same as his 13-point advantage four years ago. Obama's 1-point lead among men in 2008 has, on the other hand, collapsed.</p> <p>If the 18-point divide we currently see in an average of recent polls is just 3 points higher, then welcome to the history books. Either way, expect Democrats to keep hammering away with their \"war on women\" campaign against Republicans.</p> <p><strong>5). The race gap</strong></p> <p>Minorities are more likely to support Democrats. No Republican has achieved greater than 12% of the black vote in exit polls from 1980 through 2008. This year, they're almost assured to give Obama 95% of their votes. Likewise, Latino voters look like they'll give 70% of their vote to the president \u2013 a near all-time high. White voters, meanwhile, won't be so kind to the president.</p> <p>Republicans haven't gotten 60% or more of the white vote since 1984, when Reagan won by nearly 20 points nationwide. Romney has led among <a href=\"http://www.tnr.com/blog/electionate/109035/romney-historic-lead-among-white-voters\">white voters in recent polls</a> by an average of 18 points, and considering that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/30/race-2012-election-more-demagogics-demographics \">pre-election polls usually underestimate</a> the Republican margin among white voters, it might be even higher compared to the exit polls.</p> <p>It seems quite possible that Romney could take a greater percentage of the white vote than George HW Bush did in 1988, 59%, and actually lose. That's why the racial makeup of the electorate is key for 2012. If, as the <a href=\"http://thepage.time.com/2012/10/24/the-latest-view-from-one-prudential-plaza-why-the-obama-campaign-is-still-so-confident-about-beating-romney/\">Obama campaign believes</a>, it is becoming less white, then he'll likely win. If white Republicans are more enthusiastic than in 2008, then it's possible that the electorate could even turn out slightly whiter than it was in 2008.</p> <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p> <p>When you see how Americans are planning to vote this year, you could hardly claim that President Obama has healed the demographic divisions seen in voting patterns throughout the country. In fact, they've demonstrably gotten worse.</p> <p>That's not to say Obama's at fault. I'd argue the opposite: politics are the product of the times we live in, no matter who is in charge. Blaming Obama for being a divisive figure is symptomatic more than causal.</p>",

But the bailout was not necessarily against Romney's interests. The Republican nominee may even have made money on the deal.</p> <p>In an investigative report in <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/article/170644/mitt-romneys-bailout-bonanza\">the Nation</a>, The Best Democracy Money Can Buy author <a href=\"http://www.gregpalast.com/\">Greg Palast</a> traces how auto bailout money made its way to hedge fund investors who owned a parts manufacturer called Delphi. At least one of those investors, Paul Singer, managed at least $1 million from a blind trust belonging to Ann Romney.</p> <p>When the bailout worked for Delphi, Singer made money and the Romneys made money, Palast writes. If the Romneys did not know about their investment in Delphi, Palast writes, they should have figured it out:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Nevertheless, even if the Romneys were blind to their initial investment in Elliott [Singer's hedge fund], they would have known by the beginning of 2010 that they had a massive position in Delphi and would make a fortune from the bailout and TARP funds. Delphi is not a minor investment for Singer; it is his main holding. To invest in Elliott is essentially a \u201cDelphi play\u201d: that is, investing with Singer means buying a piece of the auto bailout.</p> </blockquote> <p>Palast lays out the case in an interview with Democracy Now <a href=\"http://www.democracynow.org/2012/10/18/greg_palast_mitt_romneys_bailout_bonanza\">here</a>. The Romney campaign replied to the report in <a href=\"http://thehill.com/blogs/transportation-report/automobiles/262839-report-romney-profited-153-million-on-auto-bailout-\">The Hill</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Romney's campaign did not deny that he profited from the auto bailout in an email to The Hill Wednesday afternoon, but it said the the report showed the Detroit intervention was \"misguided.\"</p> <p>\"The report states that Delphi had 29 US plants before the misguided Obama auto bailout, and just four after. Is this really what the president views as success,\" Romney spokeswoman Michele Davis said.</p> <p>\"Mitt Romney would have taken a different path to turning around the auto industry,\" Davis continued. \"As President, Mitt Romney will create jobs and give American workers the recovery they deserve.\"</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-24T22:04:54.151Z\">at 11.04pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-5088595895cb4897f0db5298\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-24T21:10:48.540Z\">10.10pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Guardian's <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AdamGabbatt\">Adam Gabbatt</a> calls<strong> Donald Trump's office</strong> to ask for his college records and passport records.

But campaigns depend on the media to get their messages out. A quid pro quo develops. Campaigns trade access for coverage. What's strange is when a campaign asks for coverage but wants the access part to be invisible. Case in point: asking for a newspaper endorsement based on an off-the-record conversation.</p> <p>President Obama agreed to speak with the Des Moines Register this week about the election and why the paper should endorse him. But then the White House made the conversation off the record.</p> <p>The story might have ended there, with the Register editors deciding to endorse without ever releasing the nature of their conversation with the president.</p> <p>But Register editor Rick Green wrote a <a href=\"http://www.desmoinesregister.com/article/20121024/OPINION/121024001/Register-editor-Obama-off-record-comments-deserve-shared-voters?nclick_check=1\">blog post</a> Tuesday evening about the strange stipulation:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The conference call lasted nearly 30 minutes and was an incredibly informative exchange of questions, answers and an insightful glimpse into the president\u2019s vision for a second term. He made a genuine and passionate case for our endorsement and for reelection. [...]</p> <p>Unfortunately, what we discussed was off-the-record. It was a condition, we were told, set by the White House. [...]</p> <p>We requested that the White House be asked to reverse course so whatever the president shared with us could be reviewed by voters and our readers.</p> <p>No reason was given for the unusual condition of keeping it private.</p> <p>We relented and took the call. How could we not? It\u2019s the leader of the free world on line one.</p> </blockquote> <p>Green's post caught the attention of Register readers and other media outlets. Speculation cropped up that the president had said something the White House did not want to be released. Questions about the off-the-record condition threatened to eclipse whatever impact an endorsement might have. There was the uncomfortable fact that Governor Romney had conducted an extensive, hourlong interview with the paper that he allowed <a href=\"http://bcove.me/bin26964\">to be filmed</a>.</p> <p>The White House then suddenly reversed course, conceding to the newpaper's request to release details of the conversation. The paper published the <a href=\"http://www.desmoinesregister.com/article/20121024/NEWS09/121024003/After-editor-s-blog-President-Obama-releases-transcript-of-Register-interview?Frontpage\">transcript of the conversation</a> online today.</p> <p>The bombshell in the transcript? No bombshell. Obama said a couple things slightly differently than he has said them before. The <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/24/barack-obama-des-moines-register-latinos_n_2008920.html?1351092307\">Huffington Post</a> highlighted this passage about the Latino vote:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>\"Since this is off the record, I will just be very blunt,\" Obama&#xa0;<a href=\"http://www.desmoinesregister.com/article/20121024/NEWS09/121024003/President-releases-transcript-of-Register-interview?Frontpage&amp;nclick_check=1\">said on a call</a>&#xa0;Tuesday with the Register's publisher and editor, which was originally meant to be off the record. \"Should I win a second term, a big reason I will win a second term is because the Republican nominee and the Republican Party have so alienated the fastest-growing demographic group in the country, the Latino community.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The Register will make its endorsement Saturday night.</p> <p>In 2008 the Register <a href=\"http://www.desmoinesregister.com/article/20081025/OPINION03/810260320/Register-editorial-board-endorses-Obama-President\">endorsed</a> Obama, writing, \"Obama has earned the Register's endorsement for the presidency because of his steadfastness in the face of uncertainty, his clear-eyed vision for a more just America and his potential for rallying the country to do great things.\"</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-10-24T18:35:02.120Z\">at 7.35pm BST</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50882a7ab5794584b1c13ef3\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-10-24T17:50:50.408Z\">6.50pm <span class=\"timezone\">BST</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The daughter of <strong>former candidate</strong> Jon.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/HuntsmanAbby/status/261159889169174528\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p>Attention GOP male candidates, 9.7 million more women voted than men in 2008.

  "<p>The Texas attorney general, Greg Abbott, has threatened to arrest international election monitors invited by liberal groups to observe the conduct of next month's presidential vote in states accused of attempting to disenfranchise minorities. </p> <p>Abbott has written to the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe <a href=\"https://www.oag.state.tx.us/newspubs/releases/2012/102312abbot_letter.pdf\">warning that its monitors have no right</a> to monitor the vote even though they have observed previous US elections. </p> <p>\"The OSCE's representatives are not authorized by Texas law to enter a polling place. It may be a criminal offence for OSCE's representatives to maintain a presence within 100 feet of a polling place's entrance,\" he said. \"Failure to comply with these requirements could subject the OSCE's representatives to criminal prosecution for violating state law.\"</p> <p>The OSCE is sending 44 observers to voting stations across the US at the request of various groups, including the NAACP and the American Civil Liberties Union, because of \"an unprecedented and sophisticated level of coordination to restrict voting rights in our nation\". These include attempts by several states, including Texas, to introduce voter identification laws and other measures blocked by federal courts which have ruled they were motivated by racial discrimination. </p> <p>In his letter, Abbott glossed over the recent judgements striking down the Texas identification law and pointed to a supreme court ruling in a case involving another state. </p> <p>\"The OSCE may be entitled to its opinions about voter ID laws, but your opinion is legally irrelevant in the United States, where the supreme court has already determined that voter ID laws are constitutional,\" Abbott said.</p> <p>The US routinely sends poll watchers to elections in foreign countries, particularly those where there are concerns about the fairness of the vote. <br>In television interviews, Abbott denounced the OSCE as an interfering foreign body even though the US is a founding member and it was invited by President George Bush's administration to monitor the 2004 and 2008 presidential elections in the US. </p> <p>\"If OSCE members want to learn more about our election processes so they can improve their own democratic systems, we welcome the opportunity to discuss the measures Texas has implemented to protect the integrity of elections,\" Abbott wrote. \"However, groups and individuals from outside the United States are not allowed to influence or interfere with the election process in Texas. This state has robust election laws that were carefully crafted to protect the integrity of our election system. All persons \u2013 including persons connected with OSCE \u2013 are required to comply with these laws.\"</p> <p>The OSCE responded later on Wednesday in a letter to the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, calling Abbott's threat \"unacceptable\" and noting that the organisation's Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) has an agreement with the US permitting it to monitor elections. </p> <p>\"The United States, like all countries in the OSCE, has an obligation to invite ODIHR observers to observe its elections,\" it said. \"The threat of criminal sanctions against OSCE/ODIHR observers is unacceptable.\"</p> <p>A Florida congressman running for the Senate, Connie Mack, also waded into the debate, saying that reports the United Nations wants to send election monitors was an outrage. The OSCE was founded under the UN charter.</p> <p>\"The very idea that the United Nations - the world body dedicated to diminishing America's role in the world - would be allowed, if not encouraged, to install foreigners sympathetic to the likes of Castro, Chavez, Ahmadinejad, and Putin to oversee our elections is nothing short of disgusting,\" he <a href=\"http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/news_politics/?p=39436\">told the Orlando Sentinal</a>. </p> <p>\"The United Nations should be kicked off of American soil once and for all. And the American people should demand that the United Nations be stopped from 'monitoring' American elections. The only ones who should ever oversee American elections are Americans.\"</p>",
  "<p>\u2022 What an extraordinary lack of curiosity, MPs observed to BBC director general <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/oct/23/incurious-george-entwistle-flak-jimmy-savile\" title=\"\">George Entwistle</a>, as he tried to persuade them that he never sought the details of what Newsnight had on Jimmy Savile. You knew something was going on; you never asked for even a steer on what it was they said? I was seeking not to place the news people under undue pressure, was the best he could muster. No one was very impressed. But then, says our confidant, consider the timing. Of course there is outrage and revulsion. But while Newsnight was burrowing away, both Entwistle and <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/medianews/article3577596.ece\" title=\"\">Helen Boaden</a>, the director of news, were preparing for their potentially life-changing interview boards. Both were hoping to replace Mark Thompson as director general. Entwistle won that race. And he was the popular choice among senior executives. But how would it have helped if his entire board quizzing consisted of awkward questions about Savile; inquiries about either an aired expos\u00e9 of a BBC icon by Newsnight, or a tribute yanked from the Christmas schedules under the glare of media speculation. If he were inclined to turn a deaf ear and see the whole thing kicked into the long grass, wouldn't that be understandable? Human frailty underpins most alleged conspiracies. The problem that manifests itself now is that the long grass wasn't very long.</p> <p>\u2022 Meanwhile, when the sky is falling in at the BBC over Savile, why has the Catholic St Mary's University College in Twickenham not seen fit to remove the paedophile priest <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/9515448/Manhunt-for-fugitive-paedophile-priest.html\" title=\"\">Fr Laurence Soper</a> from its list of honorary fellows (1997)? Soper, who is on the run, is wanted by police in the UK and Europe over a large number of paedophile allegations. Students and staff have been calling for his removal from the list for several weeks. The college is already in turmoil following the unrelated suspension of theology professor Anthony Towey, who dared to criticise plans to merge his department. The incident prompted several resignations, including that of another honorary fellow, the historian Eamon Duffy. It's not supposed to be a drama college, is it?</p> <p>\u2022 And what shall we do with the turbulent former archbishop? Well let's get rid of his image, for a start, answer students at King's College&#xa0;London. And so begins the battle by the student council at King's to rid their part of the main building of a likeness of Lord Carey. He was honoured as a member of the distinguished alumni, along with TV megastar Martin Bashir. But that was before Carey joined the holy war against gay marriage. He has entered with some gusto. Addressing an anti gay-marriage rally in Birmingham he warned that Christians were \"too timid\" in their opposition, and said those opposed to gay marriage could eventually experience the persecution endured by the Jews in Nazi Germany. All a bit much for the students. Tensions are high. He might want to steer clear of the place for a bit.</p> <p>\u2022 Looks like the US election will go to the wire, and the prospect of President Romney is close enough for people to begin speculating about those who might benefit. Who, for instance, would be Mitt's ambassador to London? There's a lot of talk about one of Mitt's fundraisers, a Republican big shot called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel_Sembler\" title=\"\">Mel Sembler</a>. What do we know of him? He and wife Betty set up Straight Inc, offering anti-drug therapies to teenagers. But in the 80s and 90s the gods, or more specifically the authorities, were not kind. They took a dim view of claims of ill-treatment from patients. Reborn as the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_Free_America_Foundation\" title=\"\">Drug Free America Foundation</a>, the organisation continues to peddle the no surrender approach to drugs, aided by such as George Bush's brother Jeb. So here's hoping. Mel would be a great catch for London's social scene.</p> <p>\u2022 It must have been some party. Jonathan Baume had a fair old send-off on his departure as general secretary of the civil servants' First Division Association. Never mind beer and sandwiches. This was a dinner at the <a href=\"http://www.athenaeumclub.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Athenaeum Club</a> in Pall Mall, jacket and ties required; no denim or trainers. For such things seem out of place in the smoking room. Who knows? One day, all trade union leaders may bow out like this.<em> </em></p> <p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hugh_muir\" title=\"\"><em>@hugh_muir</em></a><em> </em></p>",
  "<p>More than 915,000 campaign ads have been aired on television in the election so far, almost twice as many as in 2008, according to a detailed survey conducted by the Wesleyan Media Project.</p> <p>The research also found that the record number of ads is concentrated on fewer states than in 2008 \u2013 meaning a small number of Americans in the swing states are being bombarded with campaign messages on a scale never seen before.</p> <p>Anecdotal evidence, not in the survey, suggests that some viewers now mentally switch off when political ads appear. But the same anecdotal evidence also suggests that many voters, when asked for their views, tend to reiterate ad messages.</p> <p>The survey shows that both sides are spending more than in 2008. It confirms that it is an extremely negative campaign, with Barack Obama's team and its supporters even more negative than Mitt Romney's.</p> <p>Erika Franklin Fowler, co-director of the Wesleyan Media Project, said: \"When all is said and done, 2012 will go down as a record-pulverising year for political advertising. We've already surpassed the total number of presidential ads aired during the entire 2008 campaign and we still have two weeks to go before election day.</p> <p>\"What is striking is that the ads are concentrated on fewer markets than 2008, meaning that a smaller number of Americans have witnessed the onslaught of messages in the race for the White House.\"</p> <p>The survey found that Las Vegas, Denver and Cleveland have been the epicentres of ad campaigns. Ad volume is also up in Virginia.</p> <p>Looking at just the first three weeks of this month, spending by Democratic-leaning groups are up 438% on 2008 and Republican-leaning ones 954%. Over those three weeks, pro-Romney groups have spent more than $47m on television advertising, $10m more than their Democratic counterparts.</p> <p>In 2008, the Republican national committee was responsible for about 85% of presidential candidate John McCain's ads. This time round, the RNC is responsible for only 12% and outside groups 44%, reflecting the change in politics brought about by the supreme court ruling that lifted many restrictions on political spending.</p> <p>Although the Republicans are outspending the Democrats, the Obama campaign is in fact airing more ads. This is partly because the Obama campaign (as does the Romney campaign) benefits from cheaper ad rates than those bought by outside groups, allowing it to air more.</p> <p>Michael Franz, co-director of Wesleyan Media Project, said: \"There was a lot of talk that Romney and his allies were hoarding resources for a major ad push in the closing moments of the campaign. This was supposed to counteract the Obama advantage is ads aired throughout the earlier part of the general election campaign. We just have not seen that to date on local broadcast. And time is running out.\"</p> <p>The survey reveals that after the Obama and Romney campaigns, the biggest spender is American Crossroads, the group that includes former George W Bush strategist Karl Rove. Since 1 October, it has spent $28m on more than 26,000 ads.</p> <p>The pro-Obama group, Priorities USA, was the fourth biggest spender, with $9.5m on more than 13,000 ads. On negativity, only 11% of ads by the Romney campaign have been positive and only 6.3% of Obama's.</p> <p>In Senate races, Virginia's has been the most expensive, with $14m spent over the last three weeks.</p>",

  "<p>We've reached a moment in American history where debates can be judged by who buys the most clever keyword on Twitter and how quickly (and how many) Tumblrs are launched while they are still happening. As the series of debates this month ended, I felt a pang of guilt and jealousy for every journo-tweet that scrolled across my screen with the simple message: \"Read my take here.\" We're doing \"takes\" now \u2013 though I think of them not as quick sketches of opinion, but in the movie-production sense: a series of line-readings varied in intonation but not content.</p> <p>It would be heresy to say anything besides what's already been decided (by whom? I can't always tell), and the tide of identical opinion overwhelms subtle distinctions about individual arguments. So, when it comes to the presidential contests: Obama lost the first debate; Romney lost the second debate; foreign policy lost the third. </p> <p>The insistence on declaring a \"winner\" in presidential debates has always irritated me. In arguments over philosophy, ideology or morality, what counts as \"winning\"? Back in high school forensics, we walked into speech-and-debate tournaments ready to argue either side, fully aware that the judges evaluated logical consistency, command of the material, originality of arguments, and presentation \u2013 not who was <em>right</em>. To \"win on points\" was a meaningful phrase, because someone was keeping score.</p> <p>Today's presidential debates don't even have a consistent standard for accuracy, and \"winning on points\" just means you came out ahead in a very high-level battle of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dozens\">the dozens</a>. Very well, never mind: it's exactly like high school except then we trusted the judges, because \"zingers\" and moments of special fluency, and not truth, are what seems to sway voters. Voters are not, for instance, undecided on the question of whether across-the-board tax cuts are a good idea. (In fact, they seem set against them <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/daily/poll-don-t-extend-bush-cuts-for-wealthy-20120618?mrefid=mostViewed\">when you ask directly</a>.)</p> <p>Voters take in a discussion of tax rates as a form of instructional moral theater, a passion play in which the roles of good and evil haven't been definitively cast but will be determined by who makes the argument that <em>sounds</em> the most righteous. How else do you explain the consistent <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RealTimePolitic/status/253665216922005506\">approval</a> of Romney's tax spiel among undecided voters? The Twitter feed of the professors who supervised CNN's \"dial test\" shows, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RealTimePolitic/status/253662826395209728\">again</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ErinBurnett/status/258378909014425600\">again</a>, undecided voters reacting positively to policies that are demonstrably unpopular with most Americans, including independents, by <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57416095/cbs-news-nyt-poll-4-18-12/%20?tag=contentMain;contentBody\">margins of 20-30%</a>. (Only 36% all voters say the best way to promote economic growth is \"lower taxes and cut spending\"; 34% of independents say the same.)</p> <p>Judging the debates on salesmanship makes it easier to see past complaints from Democrats that the Romney who showed up for the debates was a different one than we saw on the stump: you can't really say Romney misrepresented <em>himself</em>, just his policies. Indeed, we saw both candidates' true nature, if not always the truth, throughout the series. </p> <p>They are both thin-skinned nerds, whose confidence about their command of facts is more certain than the facts themselves. Obama's sleepy nonchalance in the first debate and narrow-eyed near-sadism in the second spoke, in their way, to his arrogance; whereas Romney's casual, inappropriate references to all things he wants to subdue as things he \"likes\" (Big Bird, teachers, green energy) did the same.</p> <p>Romney showed himself to be awkwardly distant from the norms of American life (what struggling family doesn't look forward to tax-free capital gains!?) and speech (binders!). Obama demonstrated a Gen-X sense of humor, bordering on contemptuous (\"the 80s called\"). Romney's persnickety fixation with the debates' guidelines underscored a preoccupation with compliance that I felt belied the Obama camp's worst insinuations about him: whatever his tax returns or time at Bain might reveal, the guy is not a rule-breaker, much less a felon.</p> <p>Romney is as obsessed with following the letter of the law as Obama is with fudging literal fulfillment of regulations he believes objectionable \u2013 or, at least, politically inconvenient. However well-intentioned he might be, this is an apt description of the administration's position on <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/06/25/politics/immigration-administration-reaction/index.html\">immigration law</a> and the <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/05/obamas-legal-progression-on-defense-of-marriage-act/\">Defense of Marriage Act</a>: intentional avoidance of enforcement. This casual attitude toward regulations one doesn't care for makes Obama more like George Bush than many Democrats would like to admit (see also: drone strikes, kill lists).</p> <p>Such self-assured capriciousness when it comes to governance is not a moral position I'm particularly comfortable with \u2013 and I'm not sure it's superior to Romney's programmatic intellectual alchemy (\"You say I'm inconsistent? Here is why I'm not! See? I fixed it!\"). Even more to the point, Romney abides by the rules \u2013 but wants to rewrite them so that they benefit him and people like him. And he sees nothing wrong with that.</p> <p>Yet, for a long time, I've thought that Romney's ingrained devotion to rules would make him a relatively unobjectionable president. As my dad put it once:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"At least he won't get us into illegal wars.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>But, of course, the debates showed that Romney's most unwavering trait is changeability. He might not get us into any \"illegal wars\" \u2013 but only because <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/security/2012/08/02/627031/dan-senor-romney-closest-adviser/?mobile=nc\">Dan Senor</a> will convince him that there's a law they're following somewhere. Romney is somehow more adaptive to his environment than even our first biracial president.</p> <p>And in that way, he's following a path to victory much like the one we followed as high school rhetoricians: say anything.</p>",
  "<p>Every campaign <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/richard-adams-blog/2012/oct/24/romney-obama-october-surprise-politics-live\">fights for control over media coverage</a>. But campaigns depend on the media to get their messages out. A quid pro quo develops. Campaigns trade access for coverage. What's strange is when a campaign asks for coverage but wants the access part to be invisible. Case in point: asking for a newspaper endorsement based on an off-the-record conversation.</p> <p>President Obama agreed to speak with the Des Moines Register this week about the election and why the paper should endorse him. But then the White House made the conversation off the record.</p> <p>The story might have ended there, with the Register editors deciding to endorse without ever releasing the nature of their conversation with the president.</p> <p>But Register editor Rick Green wrote a blog post Tuesday evening about the strange stipulation:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The conference call lasted nearly 30 minutes and was an incredibly informative exchange of questions, answers and an insightful glimpse into the president's vision for a second term. He made a genuine and passionate case for our endorsement and for reelection. [...]</p> <p>Unfortunately, what we discussed was off-the-record. It was a condition, we were told, set by the White House.</p> </blockquote> <p>Green's post caught the attention of Register readers and other media outlets. Speculation cropped up that the president had said something the White House did not want to be released. Questions about the off-the-record condition threatened to eclipse whatever impact an endorsement might have. There was the uncomfortable fact that Governor Romney had conducted an extensive, hour-long interview with the paper that he allowed to be filmed.</p> <p>The White House then suddenly reversed course, conceding to the newspaper's request to release details of the conversation. The paper published the transcript of the conversation online today.</p> <p>The bombshell in the transcript? No bombshell. Obama said a couple things slightly differently than he has said them before. The Huffington Post highlighted this passage about the Latino vote:</p> <blockquote> <p>Since this is off the record, I will just be very blunt,\" Obama said on a call Tuesday with the Register's publisher and editor, which was originally meant to be off the record. \"Should I win a second term, a big reason I will win a second term is because the Republican nominee and the Republican Party have so alienated the fastest-growing demographic group in the country, the Latino community.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Register will make its endorsement Saturday night.</p> <p>In 2008 the Register endorsed Obama, writing, \"Obama has earned the Register's endorsement for the presidency because of his steadfastness in the face of uncertainty, his clear-eyed vision for a more just America and his potential for rallying the country to do great things.\"</p>",
  "<p>The Republicans opened up a new line of attack Wednesday accusing Barack Obama of trivialising the election by talking about Big Bird, binders and bayonets because he could not run on his first-term record.</p> <p>In a web ad, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogdjQjxH8LM\">the Republican national committee says</a>: \"If you do not have a record to run on, you make a big election about small things.\"</p> <p>The ad came as Obama began two-day marathon trip round six battleground states as Romney's campaign showed signs of gathering momentum, attracting his biggest crowd of the campaign yet, with more than 10,000 turning out for a late-night rally Tuesday at Red Rocks, near Denver.</p> <p>Anticipating swing state after swing state toppling in his direction on election night, Romney said Colorado could be the one that takes him over the magic 270 number of electoral college votes. \"We're on the homestretch now. And I think the people of Colorado are going to get us all the way there,\" Romney told them.</p> <p>The Republican ad carried clips of Obama talking about Big Bird and Elmo from Sesame Street, about his focus on Romney's debate remark in New York about binders full of women and Obama's dismissive remark in the last debate on Monday about the military having moved on beyond bayonets and horses.<br> As part of the frivolity charge, the Republican ad mentions Obama labelling the Republican candidate last week as suffering from 'Romnesia'.</p> <p>\"Instead of talking about issues, the president offers petty attacks,\" the ad said.</p> <p>The Romney campaign team, co-ordinating its attack with the Republicans, issued a statement suggesting that Obama's 20-page leaflet on Tuesday setting out a second-term agenda was another example of small-scale politics, just a repackaging of old ideas.</p> <p>Obama campaign advisers, speaking to reporters aboard a plane following the president round the six battleground states, insisted the president was addressing the big issues in his campaign speeches, from the economy to health, from education to foreign policy.</p> <p>Jen Psaki, one of Obama's campaign spokeswoman, disputed Republican claims that the momentum was behind its campaign. She said that Obama was tied or ahead in every single swing state, that he was is ahead in terms of early voting and that, contrary to Republican claims, the campaign expected turn-out among Latinos and African Americans, who overwhelmingly support Obama, to be a record.</p> <p>\"We expect the race to be razor-thin until the end,\" she said.</p> <p>In an interview with the Des Moines Register, which was initially off-the-record but is now on, Obama suggested that if he wins the election, it would be because Romney, in harsh rhetoric aimed at undocumented workers, had alienated Latinos. </p> <p>\"Since this is off the record, I will just be very blunt. Should I win a second term, a big reason I will win a second term is because the Republican nominee and the Republican party have so alienated the fastest-growing demographic group in the country, the Latino community,\" Obama said.</p> <p>In the interview, he also offered a little more detail on his plans for a second term, saying he would seek to complete immigration reform in his first year and that a 'grand bargain' could be agreed with Congress on tackling the deficit.</p>",
  "<p>Kasha Nelson, 31, was only supposed to go hiking with a friend. But in the 45 minutes it took to drive from Taos to Ski Valley in northern New Mexico she'd changed her vote. For the last three elections she's voted Democrat, but this time she was leaning towards Romney. \"In 2008 I got caught up in the whole hope and change thing, but I've lost total confidence in Obama's ability to get us out of this mess and I thought, with his business background, Romney might be a different breed of politician.\"</p> <p>She shared her intentions with her friend, a woman in her 20s and in a long-term relationship, who promptly reminded Kasha that she had just had an abortion. Romney's election, and the supreme court nominations that come with it, her friend argued, could take away that choice and criminalise that action. Is that what Kasha wanted? Kasha, who was raised \"very\" Catholic in a trailer in southern Alabama, believes abortion is a necessary evil. She finds the Republicans' social conservatism a \"real turn-off\" but \"has a lot of faith in the independence of the supreme court\".</p> <p>Until then, Kasha had become weary of the way all conversations about the election with her friends would start with discussions about making ends meet and then switch to abortion, contraception and gay marriage as soon as she mentioned she might vote for Romney.</p> <p>She was beginning to feel like her life was stalling and was looking for a leader who could revitalise the economy. Once a bilingual teacher, she took a career break to do a creative writing course in Santa Fe, and was now struggling to get back into the job market. After we finished breakfast she was driving five hours to Denver to take up an office job paying $6,000 less than the teaching job she'd left a few years ago.</p> <p>But when confronted with the direct experience of her friend and the direct consequence of her vote, she felt compelled to reconsider. \"I went back and looked up where Romney stood on the issues on his website and I just decided I couldn't vote for that. My vote couldn't just be about money and jobs.\"</p> <p>There are (to adopt Romney's phrase) \"binders full of women\" who are turned off by the Republicans' policies on reproductive rights. But those binders become even thicker when marital status is taken into account. <a href=\"http://thehill.com/conventions-2012/gop-convention-tampa/gop-convention-columnists/juan-williams/245509-opinion-why-the-republican-party-is-losing-the-battle-for-women-voters\">A summer poll</a> gave Obama a 46-point lead among single women like Kasha and her friend. And almost every year there are more of them. Thanks to feminism and the increased educational opportunities, equality laws and reproductive choices that have come with it, women are <a href=\"http://marriage.about.com/od/statistics/a/medianage.htm\">getting married</a> and <a href=\"http://www.babycenter.com/0_surprising-facts-about-birth-in-the-united-states_1372273.bc\">having children</a> later in life. In 1970, unmarried women comprised 38% of the population; today they are 47%. Kasha's mother got married when she was 19 and had Kasha shortly afterwards. Kasha has other options. She'd like to keep them.</p> <p>It's just one of the examples of the many ways in which Americans live, love, move and behave that is having an impact on the nation's electoral landscape. The US is becoming less white, less religious, more urban and diverse in its living arrangements, and migrating to the south and west. Some of these changes, like the growing strength of the Latino vote or an ageing population heading for the sun belt, are demographic. Last year, for the first time ever, <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2012/05/17/152896230/minorities-are-now-majority-of-u-s-births-census-says\">the majority of babies born in America were not white</a>, presaging a near future where white people will be a minority. Others, like the propensity of people to marry later and for women to remain single longer, are social. Some of these changes are happening very quickly: <a href=\"http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/NEWS/usaedition/2012-04-12-Cohabiting---with-kids---_ST_U.htm\">the proportion of children born out of wedlock</a> from 2006-2010 was double that born in 2002. Others take more time: during that same time span the median age at which American women married increased by less than a year. Many are not immediately obvious. The fastest growing \"religious group\" in the US is those with \"no religious affiliation\". In 1944 they were one in 20; in 2004 they were one in seven; by 2024 they are projected to be at least one in five. But all have political consequences. America is changing far faster and more thoroughly than its electoral rhetoric, strategies and alliances can keep up.</p> <p>\"The tectonic plates of American politics are shifting,\" <a href=\"http://www.americanprogressaction.org/issues/progressive-movement/report/2010/06/16/7953/demographic-change-and-the-future-of-the-parties/\">argues Ruy Teixeira in a 2010 paper</a> Democratic Change and the Future of the Parties for the liberal thinktank, the Center for American Progress. \"A powerful concatenation of demographic forces is transforming the American electorate and reshaping both major political parties. And, as demographic trends continue, this transformation and reshaping will deepen.\"</p> <h2>'Latinos became more moderate'</h2> <p>In few places is this clearer than <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/15/presidential-geography-new-mexico/\">New Mexico,</a> which has gone from the swingiest of states to being safely Democratic in just three election cycles. In 2000, the outcome in New Mexico was closer than Florida: Al Gore took it with a majority of just 366. In 2004 the Republicans won it back with a slightly healthier 5,988 lead. Then in 2008 there was a rout. Obama reclaimed it with a 15-point margin and a lead of 125,590. This year it is not even being contested. The last four polls there have Obama leading by double figures.</p> <p>The most obvious explanation for this would be the rising number of Latinos. Between 2000 and 2010 the state's Latino population grew 24.6%. Between 2000 and 2008 the number of registered Latino voters leaped by 44% and the number of actual Latino voters jumped by 51%. At just over a third New Mexico has the highest proportion of Latino voters of any state in the country.</p> <p>But that explanation, on its own, would be incomplete and incorrect. The number of Hispanics were growing in 2000 and 2004, yet the Republicans won the state back and increased their share of the Latino vote. The numbers continued growing and the state still elected a Republican governor (Susana Martinez, who is Latina) in 2010. So there is nothing inherent about a growing Latino population that makes a Democratic outcome inevitable. True, Latinos tend to be poorer and poor people tend to vote Democrat. <a href=\"http://www.latinodecisions.com/blog/2012/08/24/can-the-republicans-connect-with-latinos-on-abortion-2/\">But Latinos are also more likely to be religious</a> and against abortion than the nation at large too. Republicans have the only two Latino governors in the country \u2013 Martinez and Brian Sandoval in Nevada. After this election cycle they will have more Latino senators than Democrats. Of the five states with the highest proportion of Latinos two, California and New Mexico, are safely Democratic. Two, Arizona and Texas are, for now, safely Republican, and one, Nevada, is a swing state.</p> <p>So demography is not electoral destiny. People vote their interests not their identities and parties mould their platforms to appeal to people's interests. There is nothing inevitable about either. Women are evenly split on the issue of abortion; <a href=\"http://publicreligion.org/research/2012/02/january-tracking-poll-2012/\">polls showed Catholics more likely</a> to demand employers provide healthcare plans that cover birth control at no cost than Protestants. Until the 1980 Republicans were more likely to be pro-choice than Democrats. The complicating factor is that quite often those interests are intertwined with their sense of identity. Wealthy African Americans overwhelmingly vote for Democrats not because they will be better off financially, but because they are turned off by the Republicans' racially charged rhetoric.</p> <p>\"A decade ago there would have been a large number of Latinos who saw themselves as conservative. But they became more moderate as the Republicans moved to the right,\" says Gabriel Sanchez, a professor at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque. The decline has been quite dramatic. <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/pages/results/states/NM/P/00/epolls.0.html\">In 2004 Bush got 44%</a> of the Latino vote; in 2008 <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/results/polls/#val=NMP00p1\">McCain netted just 30%</a>; a poll released <a href=\"http://www.latinodecisions.com/blog/2012/10/17/new-poll-from-latino-decisions-indicates-that-immigration-matters-to-hispanic-voters-in-new-mexico/\">earlier this week by Latino Decisions</a> suggest just 24% will vote for Romney.</p> <p>The reason New Mexico has turned Democrat isn't just because it became more Latino but because Republicans simultaneously became perceived as more xenophobic. \"Republicans have really leveraged the anti-immigrant rhetoric to appeal to their white nativist base, and in the short term that might work nationally,\" explains Sanchez, who also acts as the director of research for the polling organisation Latino Decisions. \"But in the long term it will have negative effects. They are seen not as anti-immigrant but anti-Latino.\"</p> <h2>'This election is a critical juncture for the Republican party'</h2> <p>California is used as the cautionary tale. Between 1952 and 1988 it voted Republican every time bar one. In 1992 Clinton won it with 46% of the vote but it still had the potential to swing back. In 1994 came Proposition 187, a Republican-backed measure to bar undocumented migrants from healthcare, public education and other services in the state. They won the vote (though the law was found unconstitutional) and lost Latinos. Now, like New Mexico, it's safely Democratic. \"Research show that Latinos who came of voting age during that time are less likely to ever vote Republican again because that is when their image of Republicans was formed. Latinos are not in the bag for Republicans yet. But it could get that way if Republicans don't change.\" If it did, Texas and Arizona would, sooner or later, go the way of New Mexico and California.</p> <p>This is not just a problem locally, but with the entire Republican electoral strategy since the end of the civil rights era \u2013 the last time in fact that there was a seismic shift in the nation's electoral allegiances. Back then Republicans realised that if they could shed their reputation as the party of Lincoln they could peel off a whites in both the south and northern suburbs with a subtle appeal to racial animus. It worked. <a href=\"http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/\">In 1976, Jimmy Carter</a> won all the former confederate states bar Virginia. By 2000, Al Gore won none, even though he and his father had represented one of them (Tennessee) as senators.</p> <p>Richard Nixon explained the plan to his chief-of-staff, Bob Haldeman, who wrote it in his diary. \"You have to face the fact that the whole problem is really the blacks,\" Nixon told him. \"The key is to devise a system that recognises that while not appearing to.\"</p> <p>When white people made up around 85% of the voters that made sense. But over the past three election cycles alone <a href=\"http://www.pollingreport.com/2000.htm\">the white vote has dropped</a> from 80% in 2000 to 74% in 2008. With 50,000 new Latinos becoming eligible to vote every month, the long-term trend for that white share of the vote will be downward, which means the more black and Latino voters the Republicans alienate, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/sep/09/us-most-racially-polarised-election-white\">the more white voters they need to replace them</a>. \"The demographics race we're losing badly,\" said Republican, senator Lindsey Graham, acknowledging the problem. \"We're not generating enough angry white guys to stay in business for the long term.\"</p> <p>They are trying their best. Romney has a 20-point lead among whites \u2013 the biggest racial gap for almost 30 years. Meanwhile, Joe the Plumber, now a Republican congressional candidate in Ohio, has an original plan for immigration reform. \"Put a fence on the damn border and start shooting,\" he says.</p> <p>But sooner rather than later Republicans will either become more inclusive or less viable. \"This is the last time anyone will try to do this,\" one Republican strategist told the National Journal. And Republican consultant Ana Navarro told the Los Angeles Times: \"Where his [Romney's] numbers are right now, we should be pressing the panic button.\"</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398299839\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/24/1351096694145/abortion-protest-capitol-008.jpg\" alt=\"abortion protest capitol\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Republicans' stance on reproductive rights, like their southern strategy on race, was engineered during the early 1970s with electoral advantage in mind.

In <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/swing-state-demographics-might-sway-2012-election-outcome-221800949.html\">swing states like Nevada, Florida, Virginia and North Carolina</a>, white people comprise less than two-thirds of the population. In Colorado, Latinos make up 20%. Even in states like Ohio, Wisconsin or Iowa, where Latinos make up between 3% and 5% of the population, they can make a difference in a close-run contest.</p> <p>\"This election is a critical juncture for the Republican party,\" says Christine Sierra, heads UNM's Southwest Hispanic Research Institute. \"Latinos would be a more diverse voting bloc if there were reasons to vote Republican. But without those reasons its possible they could become as cohesive a voting bloc as African Americans.\"</p> <p>Republicans' stance on reproductive rights, like their southern strategy on race, was engineered during the early 1970s with electoral advantage in mind. In 1969 George Bush Sr, then a Texas congressman, told the House: \"We need to make family planning a household word. We need to take the sensationalism out of the topic so it can no longer be used by militants \u2026 who are using it as a political stepping stone.\" That same year Nixon said: \"No American woman should be denied access to family planning assistance because of her economic condition.\" But a couple of years later, <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2011/11/14/111114fa_fact_lepore\">as Jill Lepore points out in a New Yorker article</a>, Patrick Buchanan wrote a memo to Nixon advocating using the abortion issue to woo the Catholic vote. \"If the president should publicly take his stand against abortion as offensive to his own moral principles \u2026 then we can force [Ed] Muskie [a failed Democratic presidential candidate in 1972] to make the choice between his tens of millions of Catholic supporters and his liberal friends.\" The next week Nixon spoke of his \"personal belief in the sanctity of human life \u2013 including the life of the yet unborn\".</p> <p>This has served them better among evangelicals than Catholics, but it is causing considerable damage to their reputation among the growing number of educated women and unmarried couples.</p> <p>\"I just think Republicans want to take us backwards to another time,\" says Erica, 37, a school teacher who lives in Taos, New Mexico, where she raises her child alone. \"When they're talking about family values I don't think they're talking about a single mum who's juggling child care and work. I don't think they can related to a single woman in her thirties with some life experience. When you go to Planned Parenthood they don't offer you an abortion as soon as you walk through the door. They talk through your options.\"</p> <p>\"They just seem so tunnel-visioned,\" says Erica, who was raised evangelical in Minnesota. The episode when Rush Limbaugh referred to Georgetown student Sandra Fluke as a \"slut\" and a \"prostitute\" after Fluke spoke in support of mandating insurance coverage for contraception, she says, is a case in point. \"That suggests a larger attitude towards women. I don't know if Romney agrees but a large segment of his party does and he didn't come out and say that's crazy.\"</p> <p>Some progressives believe these trends spell the death knell for the Republican party in its present form. \"The Democratic party will become even more dominated by the emerging constituencies that gave Barack Obama his historic 2008 victory,\" argues Teixeira, author of <a href=\"http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2003/0305.teixeira.html\">The Emerging Democratic Majority</a>. \"While the Republican party will be forced to move toward the centre to compete for these constituencies. As a result, modern conservatism is likely to lose its dominant place in the GOP.\"</p> <p>That's too deterministic. For a start there are countervailing trends. The migration of Americans south and west over the years and <a href=\"http://realclearpolitics.blogs.time.com/2010/12/21/reapportionment-and-the-electoral-college/\">the reapportioning of electoral college seats</a> to accommodate those population movements has helped Republicans. If Obama won the same states this year as he did four years ago he would have six electoral college seats less because the population in the states he won has not risen as fast as in the states he lost. Demography alone over the last decade has handed Republicans the equivalent of Iowa.</p> <p>Moreover, most of the groups Republicans are losing are less motivated than those they have gained. Only 71% of Latinos, 76% of the unmarried and 78% of the non religious <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/154559/US-Presidential-Election-Center.aspx\">say they will definitely vote</a>. Conversely 86% of whites, 87% of Protestants and 88% of married people say they will. This is why there is such a discrepancy between how Obama fares with registered voters compared to likely voters and why the 'ground game' will in the coming weeks will be so crucial. For all the emphasis on women voters Obama is tied with women likely voters overall and trails white women by 9 points.</p> <p>For the Democrats to take advantage of these changes they have to give people something to vote for and then get them to vote. That's not necessarily as easy as it sounds.</p> <p>Still unable to bring herself to vote for Obama, Kasha cast her ballot early for Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson. \"I'm totally disgusted with the two-party system,\" she says. \"We don't have a good choice, and I don't want to want to compromise. I don't care if the guy I vote for doesn't get to win. I've had enough of just voting out of fear for the other side.\"</p>",
  "<p>A film about the killing of Osama bin Laden, which will air two nights before the US presidential election, has been re-edited to feature more footage of Barack Obama, prompting accusations Hollywood is trying to swing the vote.</p> <p>Harvey Weinstein, a studio head and prominent Democrat who has contributed to the president's campaign, tweaked the film Seal Team Six: the Raid on Osama bin Laden to broaden Obama's role.</p> <p>The new version of the 90-minute feature, which will debut in primetime on 4 November on the National Geographic Channel, and be available the next day on Nextflix, uses additional news and documentary footage to show Obama in the build-up and aftermath of the May 2011 raid which killed the al-Qaida leader in Pakistan.</p> <p>Weinstein and the director, John Stockwell, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/24/arts/television/obama-is-prominent-in-seal-team-six-weinstein-film.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1&amp;ref=politics\">told the New York Times</a> that the changes, instigated by Weinstein, were motivated not by politics but to imbue more realism.</p> <p>The footage includes the president speaking at the annual White House correspondents' dinner a day before the raid, a lonely walk in which he appears deep in thought, and a triumphant declaration \u2013 \"Justice has been done\" \u2013 after the raid.</p> <p>The extra footage was shot by Meghan O'Hara, a producer who collaborated with Michael Moore on the George Bush-bashing documentary Fahrenheit 9/11.</p> <p><a href=\" http://teaparty.org/presidents-top-campaign-fundraiser-behind-release-2-days-before-election-13785/\">Conservatives were angry about the film</a> and its timing even before the re-edit, calling the Weinstein Company and Voltage Pictures production a blatant attempt to influence voters.</p> <p>News of the new, Obama-expanded version ratcheted up resentment on blogs and website talkboards on Wednesday.</p> <p>\"It's a propaganda film from start to finish,\" said one commenter. \"I wonder if Obama is going to have a starring role and jump out of the helicopter,\" asked another. Several lamented what they called <a href=\" http://nation.foxnews.com/seal-team-six-raid-osama-bin-laden/2012/10/24/hollywood-editing-movies-help-obama-win#ixzz2AEh5nAmX\">Hollywood's liberal bias</a>.</p> <p>\"It is amazing [that] Hollywood actually believe what their big, fat hyper-inflated egos tell them \u2013 that we the people are stupid and they can do anything they want. Time to fire these 'entertainers' by <em>not</em> watching their movies or television shows.\"</p> <p>It could, from a Republican perspective, have been even worse. An earlier version of the film included a scene in which Mitt Romney appeared to oppose the raid.</p> <p>Howard T Owens, the chief executive of the National Geographic Channel, told the Times that his company demanded that scene be cut. \"We wouldn't air this if it were propaganda.\"</p> <p>The film's timing, he said, was to take advantage of the fall schedule of TV shows. Another motivation was desire to get in ahead of the Zero Dark Thirty, a bigger budget film about the raid directed by Oscar-winner Kathryn Bigelow.</p> <p>\"Other than being commercially opportunistic, we weren't considering the election,\" said Owens.</p> <p>Zero Dark Thirty was originally slated to appear in cinemas before the election, but was pushed back to December amid complaints it could unfairly boost Obama. Republicans also accused the White House of sharing classified information with Bigelow and her writer-producer, Mark Boal.</p>",
  "<p>Recep Tayyip Erdogan was in bullish mood. Hailed by supporters as the country's greatest statesman since the republic's founding father, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, Turkey's prime minister was addressing a recent congress of his neo-Islamist Justice and Development party (AKP).</p> <p>For more than two hours Erdogan pounded out his message, made self-serving comparisons with the past, and listed his achievements. According to Erdogan, echoing the former British prime minister Harold Macmillan, Turks have never had it so good.</p> <p>\"Before we came to power [in 2002], there was no economic stability, no safety, no democracy in this country,\" Erdogan said. \"The era of coups in this country will never return again ... In a country where the majority is Muslim, we let democracy rule in its most advanced form and became an example for all Muslim countries.\"</p> <p>This is not how the 50% of Turks who did not back the AKP in last year's elections see it. \"Erdogan is very authoritarian now. He's too sure of himself. His attitudes are very dangerous for Turkey and for the world,\" said Sezgin Tanrikulu, deputy leader of the opposition Republican People's party (CHP).</p> <p>\"We are witnessing the creation of a cult of personality,\" said Milliyet columnist and media activist Kadri G\u00fcrsel. \"Erdogan is becoming an elected sultan. The party congress was a one-man show ... He thinks he is the only person who can design Turkey's destiny. He suffers from a hubris syndrome.\"</p> <p>Not so, said Nursuna Memecan, an AKP MP and Erdogan friend. \"Erdogan is not authoritarian. He is detail-oriented, a micro-manager ... In our part of the world, you can't rely on delegating. So he delegates, then he oversees,\" she said. \"In a period of reform, you have to take the lead. He makes decisions \u2013 and he get things done.\"</p> <p>Like him or loathe him, both supporters and detractors agree Erdogan dominates Turkey's political scene. To his fans, he is a dynamic, modernising force. To opponents, he is divisive, even threatening. \"The AKP is not a party any more. It is Erdogan's apparatus. There is huge polarisation in this country,\" said journalist and writer Cengiz Aktar.</p> <p>Who and what Erdogan really is \u2013 dictator or democrat, visionary or villain, swaggering bully or charismatic reformer \u2013 matters more than ever these days, and not just to Turkey's nearly 80 million people.</p> <p>But every bit as important is the question of how much longer Erdogan can maintain his grip after almost a decade in power. Problems are crowding in, and for the first time in years, the prime minister looks vulnerable.</p> <p>As the Arab spring unfolded across the Middle East, Erdogan initially took credit as an exemplar and guide. Muslim Turkey's secular democracy, with one foot in the west and one in the Middle East, was held up as a model. When he toured Egypt and Tunisia last year, Erdogan was hailed as a hero.</p> <h2>Syrian civil war<br></h2> <p>But the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/syria\" title=\"\">Syrian civil war </a>has dealt a rude blow to his cherished concept of Turkish regional leadership. Erdogan's attempts to persuade President Bashar al-Assad to choose reform over repression were flatly rejected, a rebuff he took personally. His subsequent outspoken demands that Assad step down have been ignored.</p> <p>\"Erdogan underestimated Assad's staying power,\" said Fuat Keyman, director of the Istanbul Policy Centre. \"As it stands, the Syrian crisis is very dangerous, not just for Turkey but also because it could spread to Lebanon and Jordan ... The longer Syria goes on, the worse it is for Erdogan.\"</p> <p>Erdogan has come a long way from a devout Muslim upbringing in the tough, working-class Istanbul district of Kasimpasa. After attending an Islamic school and Marmara University, he became a professional footballer before getting involved in politics. Elected mayor of Istanbul in 1994, he became leader of the neo-Islamist Welfare party and was subsequently jailed, briefly, for allegedly trying to subvert Turkey's secular order.</p> <p>In 2001, after the Welfare party was banned, Erdogan helped found the AKP on a platform of jobs, better services and fairness for Turkey's urban and rural masses. The AKP emerged as the largest party in the 2002 election. In 2003, after a bar on him holding public office was lifted, Erdogan became prime minister.</p> <p>He made a hesitant start. He fought off legal attempts to ban the AKP. He struggled to maintain friendly ties with the US during the Iraq invasion. His party was accused of attempting to \"Islamise\" Turkish society, for example, by relaxing the ban on Muslim women wearing headscarves. Turkey's EU membership bid was humiliatingly blocked by France and Germany.</p> <p>But through a mixture of toughness and calibrated moderation, Erdogan survived. In the years that followed, his grip on power gradually extended to encompass all of Turkey's institutions.</p> <p>His political ally, former foreign minister Abdullah G\u00fcl, was installed as president. Opposition parties splintered under the AKP onslaught. A once-hostile judiciary is now wholly under his sway, or so his critics claim. The media is either supportive, or intimidated into silence, say leading journalists. And the once powerful military, at the heart of Turkey's shadowy \"deep state\", has been neutralised as a political force, not least through this year's so-called Sledgehammer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/25/turkey-sledgehammer-coup-trial-verdict\" title=\"\">trial of hundreds of alleged army coup plotters</a>.</p> <p>Erdogan, barred from standing for a fourth term, is widely expected to seek the presidency in 2014, but only after he has enacted a new constitution that would endow what is at present a largely ceremonial post with new powers.</p> <p>For Erdogan's idea to work, the hitherto loyal G\u00fcl must step aside, or agree to act as powerless prime minister \u2013 a swap similar to that made by Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin in Russia. Indeed, critics often liken Erdogan to Putin, a comparison that is decidedly uncomplimentary, and meant to be.</p> <h2>'Constitutional coup'<br></h2> <p>For Turkey's liberal middle classes, the pro-western intelligentsia, old school Kemalists and the rightwing nationalists who comprise the fractured opposition, Erdogan's plan amounts to a de facto \"constitutional coup\".</p> <p>\"For Erdogan, getting elected president is no problem. He's popular. It's a piece of cake,\" said a former newspaper editor. \"His problem is how to extend the powers of the presidency. He needs to change the constitution. But he is short of the two-thirds majority he needs in parliament.</p> <p>\"Probably [Erdogan's] plan will fail. So if there is no change, he has to ensure the new PM will do what he says. The problem with that is that Abdullah G\u00fcl may not do what Erdogan wants. There are signs of a widening gap between the two.\"</p> <p>Erdogan's grip on power may also be undermined by the economy. Average per capita income has trebled since 2002 and an ambitious programme of public investment in roads, housing, schools and infrastructure has fed a booming economy and his own popularity. But output has begun to fall.</p> <p>\"If the economy goes down, everything will change,\" one analyst predicted.</p> <h2>Kurdish problem<br></h2> <p>Another vexed issue is the Kurdish problem, which Erdogan promised to solve but which appears more acute than ever. This year has recorded an upsurge in Kurdistan Workers' party attacks on targets in south-east Turkey and while Erdogan hints at resumed talks, the nascent peace process that collapsed last year is effectively moribund.</p> <p>Meanwhile, thousands of elected Kurdish politicians, journalists, academics and activists have been jailed under sweeping, catch-all anti-terror legislation, and hundreds of Kurdish prisoners are on hunger strike, according to Ihsan Kagar of the Turkish Human Rights Association. For all his bluster, Erdogan appears to have no answers.</p> <p><strong>Pious generation</strong></p> <p>Suspicions also persist about Erdogan's declared ambition of raising a \"pious generation\", about the AKP's links to the Fethullah G\u00fclen movement, an influential Islamist NGO, and the Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas in Gaza. Critics insist his secret aim is to overturn Turkey's secular tradition and create an Islamist state. Supporters respond that if this were the case, he is being very slow about it. Such tensions are more about class than religion, they say.</p> <p>\"People who say such things are just trying to find ways to criticise him,\" said Nursuna Memecan. \"He wants to include people, and the privileged groups don't like that. They are taking time getting used to sitting next to people from Anatolia smelling of cows. So they create rumours that Erdogan is a dictator and must be stopped.\"</p> <p>Further question marks surround his health. He underwent an operation for an intestinal problem last year, but the nature of his illness and his current state of health are matters for conjecture. Those who have seen him up close say he looks tired and older than his 58 years.</p> <p>All the same it would be a big mistake to suggest the Erdogan era is drawing to a close \u2013 not yet at least. \"We are talking about the most powerful politician in Turkey since Ataturk,\" said Kadri Gursel. \"He is aggressive. He follows a policy of divide and rule. He is a populist. The poor urban classes like his style. His followers are Sunni, conservative, nationalist and from the same social background as him. Erdogan is a street-fighter. He is a survivor. And he wins.\"</p>",

It was a <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgOq9pBkY0I&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;hd=1\" title=\"\">two-and-three-quarter-minute YouTube video</a> in which the mogul, sitting behind a desk and seemingly channelling the spirit of a Bond villain, offered Obama \"a deal I don't believe he can refuse.\" </p> <p>It was this: \"If Obama opens up and gives his college records and applications, and if he gives his passport applications and record, I will give to a charity of his choice \u2026 a cheque, immediately, for $5m (\u00a33.1m).\" And so the political media slunk away, feeling soiled that they'd let Trump manipulate them so easily, and swearing not to be so gullible again. After all, they'd already fallen for an earlier alleged \"October Surprise\", when a website with the address Octsurprise.com appeared online, displaying a countdown clock and promising a devastating scoop, only to fizzle out in a lame joke. They weren't about to let that happen a third time. Besides, there was an important story to cover: the celebrity feminist lawyer Gloria Allred, Trump's opposite in almost every sense except in her enthusiasm for self promotion, announced that she'd soon be revealing material damaging to Mitt Romney. It was <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/election-2012/wp/2012/10/24/the-gloria-allred-october-surprise/\" title=\"\">rumoured</a> to concern testimony he'd given in the 1990s divorce case between the founder of Staples, in which Romney's Bain Capital had invested, and his wife. Could this be the long awaited October Surprise? It's about time we had one of them.</p> <p>\u2022 Whatever the so-called experts may claim, everyone knows that American presidential elections are won or lost on the strength of each side's bad puns. Judging by the frequency with which it's deployed, the Obama campaign's \"Romnesia\" gag must be working wonders. By contrast, the efforts by some Romney supporters to describe the president's facial expression during Monday night's debate as the \"<a href=\"http://www.wnd.com/2012/10/obama-slammed-for-vicious-stare-in-debate/\" title=\"\">Obamastare</a>\" don't seem to be catching on. So Republicans should be thankful for a coinage by the conservative commentator Michelle Malkin, \"<a href=\"http://townhall.com/columnists/michellemalkin/2012/10/24/obamas_hate_couture_divas\" title=\"\">hate couture</a>\", which refers to the scandalous fact that people in the fashion industry tend to vote Democratic, and that Diane von Furstenberg made a joke at a recent event about how Republicans weren't allowed. </p> <p>Fox News has a <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2012/10/23/is-anna-wintour-pressuring-designers-to-steer-clear-ann-romney/\" title=\"\">more elaborate conspiracy theory</a>: \"Is [Vogue editor] Anna Wintour pressuring designers to steer clear of Ann Romney?\" Wintour is a generous Obama backer, but the evidence is pretty thin, consisting primarily of the fact that Von Furstenberg's team haven't responded enthusiastically to Romney wearing their designs. If Fox has it right, though, these could be dangerous times for Isaac Mizrahi, who brazenly <a href=\"http://hollywoodlife.com/2012/10/23/isaac-mizrahi-ann-romney-style-michelle-obama/\" title=\"\">defied Wintour by telling an interviewer</a>: \"I would love to see Ann Romney in more of my clothes.\" If he's never heard from again, we'll know why.</p> <p>\u2022 Who are the mysterious undecided voters on whom the outcome of this election, and possibly the fate of the planet, now rests? Well, one of them seems to be the drama-prone actor Lindsay Lohan. She previously claimed to be supporting Romney, then, during Monday's debate, retweeted a pro-Obama message. Then she deleted it. Then she tweeted congratulations to both candidates for their \"nice work\", and suggested that the \"severe anxiety\" she'd been feeling during their encounter might have exceeded their own. Not that it'll matter: <a href=\"http://uk.eonline.com/news/353565/lindsay-lohan-isn-t-registered-to-vote-despite-endorsing-mitt-romney\" title=\"\">according to investigations by the website E!

  "<p>A hero of South Africa's struggle who is now a business tycoon has been accused of having the blood of Marikana mineworkers on his hands after the release of emails he sent to mine management and government ministries.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.thepresidency.gov.za/pebble.asp?relid=1009\" title=\"\">Cyril Ramaphosa</a>, who 25 years ago led the National Union of Mineworkers in a key strike against the white minority regime, was criticised for betraying the very people he used to represent.</p> <p>Soweto-born Ramaphosa, 59, co-authored the widely revered post-apartheid constitution and remains a patrician figure in the governing African National Congress \u2013 but his business interests include a seat on the board of Lonmin, the company that owns the platinum mine where, two months ago, a wildcat strike led to a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/07/marikana-mine-shootings-revive-soweto\" title=\"\">police massacre of 34 workers</a>.</p> <p>On Tuesday, the official commission of inquiry into the Marikana tragedy was shown a stash of emails written by Ramaphosa, suggesting that he sought to intervene with senior government figures on Lonmin's behalf. On the eve of the killings, he called for action against miners engaged in \"dastardly criminal\" conduct.</p> <p>His apparent switch of sides is being described as a parable of how South Africa's liberators became seduced by crony capitalism. \"It's a personal tragedy,\" said Adam Habib, a professor of political science at Johannesburg University. \"This is the general secretary of the NUM 25 years ago and architect of the South African constitution. It's a symbolic example of the degeneration of a cadre and civil activist and how he has become entrapped by his newfound wealth. It resonates so powerfully because It's typical of many in the ANC.\"</p> <p>Workers at the Lonmin mine went on strike on 10 August. Within four days, 10 people had been killed, including two policemen and two security guards, prompting Ramaphosa to email Albert Jamieson, Lonmin's chief commercial officer. \"The terrible events that have unfolded cannot be described as a labour dispute,\" he wrote. \"They are plainly dastardly criminal and must be characterised as such \u2026 There needs to be concomitant action to address this situation.\"</p> <p>Releasing the email to the commission, advocate Dali Mpofu, who is representing injured mineworkers and more than 200 who were arrested, said: \"This was on 15 August at 2.58pm, exactly 24 hours before the people were mowed down on that mountain. We have emails that were being exchanged between Lonmin management, government ministers [of mineral resources and the police] and at the centre is a gentleman called Cyril Ramaphosa.\"</p> <p>Mpofu said Ramaphosa had called for action to deal with the \"criminals\", whose crime was to seek a wage increase.</p> <p>\"It is clear Ramaphosa was directly involved by advising what was to be done to address these 'dastardly criminal actions', which he says must be characterised as such and dealt with effectively.\" The emails showed a direct \"toxic collusion\" between Ramaphosa, Lonmin, mineral resources minister Susan Shabangu's department, the police ministry and state security agencies, he added, describing the shootings as \"premeditated murder of defenceless people\".</p> <p>Ramaphosa warned the police minister, Nathi Mthethwa, to come down hard on the strikers, and was lobbied by Lonmin management to \"influence\" Shabangu and advised her that \"silence and inaction\" on the events was \"bad for her and government\", it was claimed.</p> <p>An email from Ramaphosa with the subject heading \"Security Situation\" reads: \"You are absolutely correct in insisting that the minister [Shabangu] and indeed all government officials need to understand that we are essentially dealing with a criminal act. I have said as much to the minister of safety and security.\"</p> <p>In another email, Ramaphosa highlights his \"interaction with some of the roleplayers\", including a proposed conversation with the ANC secretary general, Gwede Mantashe, to suggest that the party intervene. There was also a proposed meeting with Shabangu in Cape Town to discuss \"what she needs to do\".</p> <p>Two days after the shooting, Ramaphosa's Shanduka company announced he had donated R2m (\u00a3142,315) towards the funeral costs of the miners. <a href=\"http://www.shanduka.co.za/news-releases/WHAT-WE-DO-NOW-WILL-DEFINE-US-AS-A-NATION/index.html?&amp;re=1\" title=\"\">He wrote in South Africa's Sunday Times</a>: \"There are few innocents in this tragic saga \u2026 For wherever we find ourselves, we cannot escape the sense that, through our action or inaction, we bear some responsibility for the circumstances that made such a tragedy possible. As we mourn, so too must we introspect.\"</p> <p>Ramaphosa has been touted as a possible deputy to President Jacob Zuma in an ANC leadership election in December. Earlier this year he chaired a party disciplinary appeals committee that upheld the expulsion of ANC youth league president Julius Malema.</p> <p>Siphiwo Gqala, a miner in Marikana who survived the massacre, said on Wednesday: \"I'm so angry with Cyril Ramaphosa. Now there are rumours of him going for deputy president. They will be voting for someone [in December] who sent an email saying they must do something about us.\"</p> <p>The ANC youth league called for Ramaphosa to apologise to the families of the injured and dead. \"As a seasoned unionist, the ANC Youth League expected more from comrade Ramaphosa,\" spokeswoman Khusela Sangoni-Khawe said.</p> <p>\"The criminal acts he spoke of were the legitimate calls of workers demanding a decent wage. We concur with the assertions made by the legal representative of the workers: Marikana was a premeditated murder of our people and comrade Cyril has the blood of Marikana workers on his hands.\"</p> <p>She added: \"He has clearly decided to nail his flag to the mast of capital. He has sold out the people.\"</p> <p>Rehad Desai, spokesman for the Marikana Support Campaign, said: \"The journey of Cyril Ramaphosa from a talented, assiduous, brave trade union leader to a crony capitalist is a tremendous arc. It's highly disappointing for our campaign supporters who held him in high esteem over the years. We should call on the ANC to seriously consider his membership if they want to retain the respect of thinking South Africans.\"</p> <p>Ramaphosa, who last month apologised on national radio for extravagantly bidding R18m (\u00a31.28m) for a buffalo and its calf, declined to comment on the emails. Lonmin stated: \"Lonmin's action to engage with appropriate authorities of the state was simply part of a process aimed at achieving normality.\"When a graphic video of the 34 strikers being shot dead by police was played at the commission on Tuesday, many grieving widows, wearing black mourning headscarves, erupted in tears.

  "<p>One agency in the US has the power to invade and investigate the White House: the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Its extraordinary powers make it the closest thing the country has to a secret police.

And eyes-only intelligence secured for the president \u2013 or against him \u2013 is the political equivalent of a nuclear warhead. Its mere possession is sufficient to deter an enemy, and the FBI's J Edgar Hoover had an arsenal unsurpassed in the annals of 20th-century America.

No other Democratic president has been free of the fear of the power of the FBI since Lyndon B Johnson took office in 1963. Harry Truman worried aloud that the Bureau would become an \"American Gestapo\". John F Kennedy knew Hoover had 20-year-old sex tapes of his liaison with a suspected Nazi agent, and he shared his national security adviser's opinion that Hoover was \"a goddamned sewer\", collecting and disseminating dirt. But most presidents have taken pleasure in using the FBI as a sword and a shield to protect and defend their powers.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UV316AC_YfI\" title=\"Franklin D Roosevelt gave J Edgar Hoover the power\">Franklin D Roosevelt gave J Edgar Hoover the power</a> to eavesdrop, plant hidden microphones, and purloin secrets through burglary. When the Supreme Court outlawed telephone wiretaps, Roosevelt told Hoover, in so many words, to hell with the court. He relished the political intelligence and the unsavoury scuttlebutt that Hoover brought him. He knew that secret agents can be scofflaws; yet their techniques are useful against terrorists.</p> <p>When Hoover ruled the FBI \u2013 as he did for 48 years, until his death in 1972 \u2013 he was confounded by the American electorate only once. After Roosevelt died in office, near the end of the second world war, Hoover, like his fellow Americans, assumed the Republican candidate, Thomas Dewey, would defeat President Truman in November 1948. Dewey, who had made his name as a crime\u2013fighting prosecutor, would have been the first rock-ribbed conservative elected to the White House in 20 years. Hoover was working behind the scenes to support Dewey, who shared Hoover's views on the national emergency confronting the US in the early days of the cold war.</p> <p>The autumn of 1948 was a dangerous moment in American democracy. As the civilian leader in the war on communism, Hoover was no longer obeying the president. \"He wasn't taking orders from Truman or anybody else,\" said Stephen Spingarn, an army counterintelligence officer serving as a White House adviser. Hoover sought sweeping national security powers over law enforcement and intelligence, sufficient to make him a secret police tsar. The White House pushed back. \"That was contrary to our whole tradition,\" Spingarn said. \"You did that in communist and fascist countries, but you don't do that in the United States.\"</p> <p>Hoover wanted to detain thousands of politically suspect American citizens in the event of a crisis with the Soviets. The broad outlines of Soviet espionage in the US were beginning to come clear; Stalin's spies had stolen American atomic secrets. Hoover now drew up plans for the mass detention of political suspects in military stockades: a secret prison system for jailing American citizens, including the suspension of the ancient writ of habeas corpus. Hoover's national security assistant, Mickey Ladd, began working out the details for an American Guant\u00e1namo in October 1948. The FBI and the army would hold the detainees at military bases in and around New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles. The FBI, the CIA, and army intelligence officers would share the duties of carrying out the thousands upon thousands of interrogations.</p> <p>Truman looked powerless and politically spent as the election approached. Travelling on a long whistle-stop campaign, with the election four weeks away, he caught a glimpse of a Newsweek magazine poll of America's 50 most prominent political reporters. Their unanimous prediction: Dewey defeats Truman. Hoover went to sleep on election night confident in the outcome. But at 11.14am on Wednesday, 3 November 1948, the bulletin went out across the world: Truman had won the biggest upset in the history of the American presidency. A shift of only 33,000 voters in California, Illinois, and Ohio would have given Dewey victory. When Hoover heard the news, he left his desk at FBI headquarters and did not come back for two weeks. He simply disappeared.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398289882\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/24/1351091990605/John-F-Kennedy-with-J-Edg-008.jpg\" alt=\"John F Kennedy with J Edgar Hoover in 1961\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">President John F Kennedy (left) considered FBI chief J Edgar Hoover (right) 'a goddamned sewer'.

He served to ensure the election of Lyndon B Johnson, his long-time Washington neighbour, their friendship bonded over sips of Jack Daniel's and backyard barbecues. Johnson loved secret intelligence; he craved it as he did whisky and cigarettes.</p> <p>After the assassination of President John F Kennedy, both men feared that his brother, Attorney General Robert F Kennedy, would seize the fallen mantle. Hoover hated Bobby Kennedy with a passion and ceased to communicate with him. Though the attorney general was his titular superior, Hoover effectively cut off his supply of information and power, ending the possibility that Kennedy could command the Democratic party.</p> <p>Then an FBI intelligence operation in the Deep South provided Johnson with essential political ammunition for his election. Johnson was furiously pushing civil rights legislation that would allow black Americans the right to vote and deny racist senators the ability to block them from the polls. He needed to destroy the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan\" title=\"Ku Klux Klan\">Ku&#xa0;Klux Klan</a>, which was murdering civil rights&#xa0;workers, blowing up black churches, and ruling by fear throughout the South.</p> <p>On 2 July 1964, Johnson ordered Hoover to go to Mississippi and proclaim the omnipotence of the FBI. The director was dubious; he thought the civil rights workers, not the racists, were the primary problem. \"Whatever you do, you're going to be damned,\" Hoover said. \"Can't satisfy both sides.\" Then he got a direct order from the president. \"Ain't nobody going to damn you,\" said Johnson, who was secretly taping the telephone call. \"Ain't anybody in this country has the respect you have.\"</p> <p>Johnson knew how to twist Hoover's arm: \"Now I don't want these Klansmen to open their mouths without your knowing what they're sayin'. Now nobody needs to know it but you, maybe, but we ought to have intelligence on that state \u2026 I want you to have the same kind of intelligence that you have on the communists.\"</p> <p>Johnson was telling Hoover to go after the Klan in language he understood. Hoover obeyed. He would subvert them and sabotage them, so long as Johnson commanded that it be done. The FBI broke the Ku Klux Klan like dry twigs. The civil rights laws were passed, and Johnson won in a landslide, with the votes of millions of white liberals and newly enfranchised black citizens.</p> <p>Days before he left office, Johnson told his successor, Richard M Nixon: \"If it hadn't been for Edgar Hoover, I couldn't carry out my responsibilities as commander-in-chief \u2013 period. Dick, you will come to depend on Edgar. He is a pillar of strength in a city of weak men.\"</p> <p>Hoover had helped Nixon gain power from 1947 onward, feeding him secret intelligence on American communists such as <a href=\"https://files.nyu.edu/th15/public/home.html\" title=\"Alger Hiss\">Alger Hiss</a>. But Hoover died in May 1972, and six weeks later, Nixon's henchmen were arrested breaking into the offices of the Democratic National Committee at the Watergate hotel. They had burglary tools and a gadget that the police thought was a bomb disguised as a smoke detector: it was a sophisticated electronic eavesdropping device. The suspects had crisp $100 bills and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZUQ6hKmwkI\" title=\"Watergate hotel\">Watergate hotel</a> keys in their pockets. Their ringleaders were Gordon Liddy, a former FBI agent, and Howard Hunt, a former CIA officer. The FBI quickly determined that both men worked for the president.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398289883\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/10/24/1351092617991/J-Edgar-Hoover-and-Richar-008.jpg\" alt=\"J Edgar Hoover and Richard Nixon \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hoover (right), who helped Richard Nixon (left) gain power, was dead by the time Nixon clashed with the FBI over Watergate.

He recognised Liddy's name; he had met him at the FBI a decade before. When he heard that the burglars had been caught with eavesdropping equipment, he immediately opened a case under the federal wiretapping statutes. At about four in the afternoon, his secretary answered the phone and told him the White House was calling.</p> <p>\"This is Agent Supervisor Dan Bledsoe,\" he said. \"Who am I speaking with?\"</p> <p>\"You are speaking with <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/onpolitics/watergate/johnehrlichan.html\" title=\"John Ehrlichman\">John Ehrlichman</a>. Do you know who I am?\"</p> <p>\"Yes. You are the chief of staff there at the White House.\"</p> <p>\"That's right. I have a mandate from the President of the United States,\" Ehrlichman said. \"The FBI is to terminate the investigation of the break-in.\" Bledsoe was silent.</p> <p>\"Did you hear what I said?\" Ehrlichman thundered. \"Are you going to terminate the investigation?\"</p> <p>\"No,\" Bledsoe said.</p> <p>\"Do you know that you are saying 'no' to the President of the United States?\"</p> <p>\"Yes,\" the FBI agent replied.</p> <p>The FBI investigated the break-in. Nixon's resignation came two summers thereafter.</p> <p>Fast-forward 40 years: the White House, 12 March 2004.</p> <p>The FBI director, Robert Swan Mueller III, who had taken office on 4&#xa0;September 2001, walked into the Oval Office with a handwritten letter of resignation in his breast pocket. He had determined, along with the attorney general, that the electronic-eavesdropping programmes created in great secrecy by President George W Bush after the 9/11 attacks had violated the constitution's protections against unreasonable searches and seizures. He would not consent to their use unless the president scaled them back to the boundaries of the law.</p> <p>Mueller told Bush face-to-face that he would resign if the FBI was ordered to continue warrantless searches on Americans. Both men had sworn upon taking office to faithfully execute the laws of the US. Only one still held to his oath.</p> <p>Bush promised to put the programmes on a legal footing. This did not happen overnight. It took years. But he backed down. Mueller has never breathed a word of what happened at the White House. But he is an exemplar of what the FBI must do every day.</p> <p>The man who was then the acting attorney general, James Comey, later described what Mueller had heard from Bush: \"If we don't do this, people will die.\"</p> <p>\"You can all supply your own 'this',\" Comey said. \"'If we don't collect this type of information' or 'If we don't use this technique' or 'If we don't extend this authority.' It is extraordinarily difficult to be the attorney standing in front of the freight train that is the need for this,\" Comey said. \"It takes far more than a sharp legal mind to say 'no' when it matters most. It takes moral character. It takes an ability to see the future. It takes an appreciation of the damage that will flow from an unjustified 'yes'. It takes an understanding that, in the long run, intelligence under law is the only sustainable intelligence in this country.\"</p> <p>The FBI today is still calibrating the balance between liberty and security. Barack Obama, a Democrat grounded in civil liberties, and Mueller, still the civilian commander of domestic security, are two very different men who <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-seeks-extension-for-robert-mueller-as-fbi-director/2011/05/12/AFdmE8zG_story.html\" title=\"manage to see eye-to-eye\">manage to see eye-to-eye</a>. Mueller, born to wealth and privilege, joined the US Marines and led troops in combat at the height of the war in Vietnam, where he was decorated for valour. Marine officers follow a code: if your troops go up the hill, you go up the hill. Over the past decade, Mueller has led his agents to believe they must fight the threat of terrorism without trampling civil rights. By and large he has succeeded. Mitt Romney and the Republicans have thus far failed to credibly attack Obama's right flank on issues of national security. In this way, the FBI has protected the power of the&#xa0;president.</p> <p>Obama and Mueller have never clashed on any significant issue of counterterrorism or civil liberties. The two men meet most mornings in the White House; unlike the presidencies of Clinton and Jimmy Carter, the discourse is not a dialogue of the deaf. Obama, who never came on to the FBI's radar until he started running for the White House, is intensely attuned to the difference between existential threats and idle chatter; 99% of what US intelligence hears is the latter. Mueller works on the same wavelength; he spent much of his first five years in office after the 9/11 attacks trying to filter out raw intelligence reporting that led the FBI to investigate pizza deliverymen and delusional sociopaths. The focus on analysing actual threats from potential terrorists has reduced the fear factor in daily political discourse, both at the White House and on the 24-hour ravings on the airwaves at Rupert Murdoch's Fox and its affiliates.</p> <p>The balance between national security and civil liberties remains delicate. The authors of the constitution foresaw this struggle 10 generations ago. A free people must have both security and liberty. They are opposing forces, yet we cannot have one without the other. Mueller has said we will not win the war on terrorism if we lose our freedoms in the battle. He knows Americans will surrender guarantees of liberty for promises of security. They may feel more safe, but they will be less free. He&#xa0;lives each day in this state of continual conflict. We all do. No free republic in the history of&#xa0;civilisation has survived for more than 300 years.</p> <p>\u2022 Tim Weiner is the author of Enemies: A History of the FBI (Allen Lane, \u00a325/$30), out now.</p>",
  "<p>There was a moment, in the second presidential debate, when President Barack Obama and Governor Mitt Romney circled each other warily, looking like they were about to come to blows. So when they agree on something, it perks up the ears.</p> <p>It turns out that, in the final debate on Monday, they agreed on two things.</p> <p>The first point is that Americans, largely don't care about \u2013 or at least won't vote based on \u2013 foreign policy. That's why both candidates, after some bickering about Syria, Egypt and Libya, hijacked Monday's final presidential debate into the political version of a Thelma and Louise rebellion, careening into domestic policy, education, and other issues more likely to sway the American heart.</p> <p>But before they did, there emerged another, subtler point of agreement: the highlight of American foreign policy right now has been our successful sanctions against Iran, which may be working on developing a nuclear weapon. As each candidate struggled to outdo the other in protestations of the purity of their love for Israel, they knew that the way to Israel's heart was to shut down Iran. Both Obama and Romney were happy to point to evidence that America has done just that.</p> <p>Obama noted, during the debate, that the Iranian rial has dropped in value by 80% and the country's oil production is lower than it has been for two decades. \"So their economy is in a shambles,\" Obama said. Romney agreed that Iranian sanctions have been successful, adding only that he would go even further \u2013 perhaps even to the brink of military action.</p> <p>But have we been smart and powerful enough to bring Iran around to our way of thinking after decades of trying? Has the threat of American financial power been the decisive factor that may have wiped the confident smirk off the face of Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmedinejad?</p> <p>It's easy to see why it's appealing to think so.&#xa0;In an otherwise bleak year for both foreign policy and the economy, when the US seems to be floating somewhere undefined between a grim recent financial past and a tiresome future of endless sniping about tax policy, the fact that we can exert financial pressure on Iran seems a chance for a well-deserved pat on the back.</p> <p>This summer, the US financial authorities fined major international banks \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/08/standard-chartered-bank-charges-merit-real-penalties-if-proved\">HSBC, Standard Chartered</a> \u2013 for money-laundering, which included, in part, helping Iran evade US financial sanctions. Between the <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/politico44/2012/07/white-house-insists-iran-sanctions-are-working-130653.html\">presidential chest-beating</a> and the big fines, the message seemed clear: one thing, at least, is going right. America still has its old mojo. The war in Iraq didn't turn out quite right, our influence in Afghanistan may be questionable, and we may remain baffled about what to do about Benghazi and even Egypt, but when it comes to Iran, America has come out like a champ.</p> <p>But, not so fast. As another iteration of President Obama might have said, \"If you have successful Iranian sanctions, you didn't build that.\"</p> <p>We owe, instead, a lot more credit to our beleaguered compatriots who run the European financial system. Iran gave up on the US years ago; America has had sanctions on Iran, in some form or another, since 1979. Getting around that was easy for Iran. Every time US authorities banned one suspicious Iranian entity, another would pop up, as quick as zucchini, and would go on doing business \u2013 most likely, in Europe.</p> <p>Jim Rickards is the author of <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/ralphbenko/2012/03/12/book-review-james-rickards-currency-wars/\">the book Currency Wars</a> and a partner with the hedge fund JAC Capital, as well as an adviser to intelligence agencies on financial and economic issues. Of America's attempts to root out Iranian dictators and particularly Ahmedinejad, he says:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"We've tried everything: cyberwarfare, financial warfare, psychological operations, assassinations and sabotage. It's not like we haven't been trying. But because the [Ahmedinejad] regime is so brutal, so entrenched, so powerful and so rich, it has not produced the thing everyone wants, which is Iran giving up on its nuclear ambitions. It's very clear diplomacy has failed and Iranians use the promise of negotiations just to buy time.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>So, why is Iran weakening now \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/21/world/iran-said-ready-to-talk-to-us-about-nuclear-program.html?hp&amp;_r=0\">as the New York Times reports, seeking talks</a>?</p> <p>Because, since March, the European financial system, which had been adamantly neutral, has turned against Iran. Europe&#xa0;is the base of the core of the global financial system: <a href=\"http://www.swift.com/banks\">Swift, a kind of international instant-message service of banking</a>. Every major financial transaction in Europe has to be chronicled in Swift. When Citigroup has to send, say, $1bn to Deutsche Bank, it doesn't just shovel the money over. Citi sends a message through Swift first.</p> <p>In March, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/16/world/middleeast/crucial-communication-network-expelling-iranian-banks.html?_r=0\">Swift kicked out 30 Iranian banks</a>, preventing them from doing business in euros. The US also prevented Iran from doing business in dollars. Then, in mid-October, <a href=\"http://hsf-fsrandcorpcrimenotes.com/2012/10/17/eu-strengthens-sanctions-against-iran-with-particular-impact-for-oil-and-gas-sector-and-financial-institutions/\">Europe proposed to penalize any banks doing business on behalf of Iran</a> and proposed penalties on natural-gas exports.</p> <p>After that, it wasn't long before that New York Times report surfaced that Iran was ready to start diplomatic talks with the US. The Obama administration <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/21/report-on-iran-talks-reverberates-on-sunday-shows/?ref=politics\">denies the report, though the New York Times stands by it</a>.</p> <p>\"Getting [Europe's] commitment to tighten the noose on Iran is really important to help persuade that country,\" said Tony Fratto, of Hamilton Place Strategies, who was an adviser in the Bush administration. \"We haven't had indirect or loose ties with Iran since 1979. Europe has. A lot of Iranians with wealth store their wealth in Europe.\"</p> <p>Unable to do business in either dollars or euros, Iran is in a dangerous political position. A few months ago, Iran started creating multiple exchange rates in its economy, allowing people to get rare dollars more cheaply only if they are importing absolutely essential goods into Iran. So, $1 in America is now worth 12,279 rials \u2013 and that's only if the rials are used to buy essentials like medicine and grain for food. Those who want to buy livestock or minerals pay something closer to 25,500 rials for a single US dollar. The actual exchange rate, which now functions largely in the black market, is closer to 35,000 rials for each American dollar.</p> <p>This <a href=\"http://www.thestar.com/news/world/article/1276152--international-sanctions-mean-skyrocketing-prices-for-iranians\">hits both the rich and the poor</a>. Iran is still a country of sophisticated consumers, who like their iPods and their HP printers as much as we do. But those goods are smuggled into the country, and the smugglers accept usually dollars. Simple supermarket trips are becoming a complicated calculus. And as for Iranians in hospitals, or those served by charities, they are suffering for lack of supplies.</p> <p>Overall, the Iranian economy is struggling with sky-high inflation \u2013 as high as nearly 70%, <a href=\"http://www.marketoracle.co.uk/Article37144.html\">estimates Johns Hopkins economist Steven Hanke</a>. This is exactly what America wants: a regime struggling with a bad economy has much more trouble holding on to power.&#xa0;Hyperinflation is a reliable harbinger of a government that's about to topple. Look at Germany during the Weimar Republic, or China just before the Tiananmen Square riots. Hyperinflation often predates revolutions.</p> <p>Iran threatened Tuesday to stop producing oil, a move that Fratto compared to cinematic farce. \"Iran doesn't even produce their own gasoline; they don't have refineries,\" he pointed out. \"They need to export oil or go bankrupt. I guess they could turn off the spigot for a short while, but it's really suicidal for them to do it. It's like Blazing Saddles when the guy holds the gun up to his own head and says 'Stop or I'll shoot.'\"</p> <p>Iran's bind is a good lesson not in American power, but in America's power when we share it with allies.</p> <p>During and after the financial crisis, what helped stabilize the US and European economies was the fact that the US Federal Reserve worked with the European Central Bank to pour money into the system. The old unilateral model of a single country ruling a financial empire \u2013 even a soft empire \u2013 seems to have passed. To influence the world economy and topple regimes, you need coalitions to move money. And only then can you move the world.</p>",

Grappone said Ayotte will remain in New Hampshire.</p> <p>The Republican candidate for governor in Indiana, Mike Pence, said he \"strongly disagree[s]\" with Mourdock and has urged him to apologise.</p> <p>In his press conference on Wednesday, Mourdock lamented his \"less than fully articulate use of words\".</p> <p>\"Humility is an important part of my faith,\" he said. \"I am a much more humble person this morning because so many people mistook, twisted, came to misunderstand the points i was trying to make\".</p> <p>During Tuesday's debate, Mourdock, who is anti-abortion except in cases where the mother's life is at risk, was asked about his stance on abortion where a woman has been raped.</p> <p>\"I struggled with it myself for a long time, but I came to realize that life is that gift from God,\" Mourdock said. \"And, I think, even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that it is something that God intended to happen.\"</p> <p>Democrats seized on the comment and called upon Romney to withdraw his endorsement for Mourdock and pull his ad now airing in Indiana on behalf of the Senate candidate.</p> <p>\"It is perplexing that he wouldn't demand to have that ad taken down,\" Obama campaign spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki told reporters.</p> <p>The campaign said President Obama found Mourdock's comments \"outrageous and demeaning to women\" and said the assertions were \"a reminder that a Republican Congress working with a Republican president in Mitt Romney would feel that women should not be able to make choices about their own healthcare.\"</p> <p>Romney was pro-choice as governor of Massachusetts, but is now anti-abortion except in certain cases. Vice-presidential candidate Paul Ryan is opposed to abortion in all cases, with no exceptions \u2013 on the face of it a stronger stance than Mourdock.</p> <p>Mourdock did receive support from the national Republican senatorial committee.</p> <p>In a statement, its chairman, John Cornyn, said: \"Richard and I, along with millions of Americans \u2013 including even Joe Donnelly \u2013 believe that life is a gift from God. To try and construe his words as anything other than a restatement of that belief is irresponsible and ridiculous,\" Cornyn said.</p> <p>Mourdock is not the first Republican to find himself in hot water over abortion beliefs. In August, Todd Akin, Republican Senate nominee from Missouri, said that pregnancy as a result of \"legitimate rape\" is rare as \"the female body has ways to try and shut that whole thing down\".</p> <p>Just last week Republican congressman Joe Walsh of Illinois told reporters \"you can't find one instance\" where it has been necessary to perform an abortion due to the risk to the mother's life due to medical advances. Medical experts note that there are some cases where the only option in the case of complications sustained during pregnancy is to abort the foetus.</p> <p>The Indianapolis Star reported that after the debate, Donnelly, the Democratic senate candidate, \"shook his head over\" Mourdock's comments. \"I don't know any God who would ever intend something like that,\" Donnelly reportedly said.</p>",

Politically, not so much; the figures will be out tomorrow and they will be whatever they are. We plebs can wait. But it does matter to markets; these figures are highly market sensitive, especially if they're better or worse than expected. And the exchange rate clearly did move at about the right time: there was a significant upward movement in the sterling/dollar rate that began shortly after 12pm (I chose that rate because the US markets haven't opened yet, so it's less likely to be distorted by other news than the sterling-euro rate) ...</p> <p>So if Nick Robinson's interpretation is that the PM was talking about the GDP figures, that's a problem. It&#xa0;undermines public trust in the independence and reliability of the official statistics, which in the long turn benefits nobody. So I don't think there's much point going on about the PM's possible but unprovable violation of the rules; or of trying to establish exactly what explains market movements.

Photograph: Oli Scarff/Getty Images</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oli Scarff/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the Commons, MPs are debating a Labour motion on energy market reform. <strong>Caroline Flint</strong>, the shadow energy secretary, opened the debate by claiming that the government's energy bill would do nothing to get prices down for consumers.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If the government are as concerned about energy bills as they claim to be, why is it that their flagship energy bill does absolutely nothing to help people struggling to make ends meet? Over the last two years we've had countless white papers, consultations, updates and even a draft bill, but not once have we seen anything that recognises the need for urgent reform or challenges the prices and practices of the big companies, or lives up to its name and genuinely reforms the energy market.</p> </blockquote> <p>To coincide with the debate, Labour has published <a href=\"http://www.labour.org.uk/uploads/57e4ad64-60c7-31e4-35ce-400ed575ed04.pdf\">its own five-page document on energy policy (pdf).</a> Here's an extract.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A Labour Government would do three things to reform the energy market. We would abolish Ofgem and create a tough new energy watchdog with the power to force energy companies to pass on price cuts when wholesale costs fall. We would require the energy companies to pool the power they generate and to make it available to any retailer, to open up the market and make it more transparent. We would also require energy companies to put all over-75s on their cheapest tariff, which could save as many as 4 million pensioners as much as \u00a3200 a year from their annual energy bills.</p> </blockquote> <p>Consumerism seems to be at the heart of Ed Miliband's politics at the moment and, reading Nick Robinson's cracking new book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Live-From-Downing-Street-Robinson/dp/0593066804\">Live from Downing Street</a> (part lively, incisive potted history of the relationship between politicians and journalists, part colourful memoir of his experience as a broadcaster, including the obligatory \"how Peter Mandelson tried to get me sacked\" anecdote that features in all autobiographical books by contemporary political journalists), I came across an excellent phrase to describe this. It's \"Which? magazine socialism\". Robinson recalls hearing John Cole using the phrase shortly after the 1992 general election, in a private argument with Tony Blair in the On the Record green room after Blair gave an interview about how Labour needed to change. Cole was using the term to disparage the consumer-focused politics that Blair was championing. In retrospect, it does not seem a particularly good definition of Blairism (not least because it contains the word socialism).

But, at PMQs, Cameron said prisoners would not be given the vote.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>No one should be in any doubt. Prisoners are not getting the vote under this government. I don\u2019t want prisoners to have the vote, and they should not have the vote.</p> </blockquote> <p>However Cameron did not rule out having another vote on the matter to allow parliament to express its view.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If it helps by having another vote in Parliament on another resolution to make absolutely clear, to help put the legal position beyond doubt, I am very happy to do that.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 Cameron has announced that the Crown Prosecution Service will review its decision not to charge Jimmy Savile over alleged sexual abuse.</strong> He made the announcement at PMQs.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The director of public prosecutions has confirmed that his principal legal adviser will again review the papers from the time when a case was put to the CPS [Crown Prosecution Service] for prosecution. The director of public prosecutions specifically is going to consider what more can be done to alert relevant authorities where there are concerns that a prosecution is not taken forward. The government will do everything it can do, other institutions must do what they can do, to make sure that we learn the lesson of this and it can never happen again.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 Cameron has told MPs that Britain\u2019s economic prospects are improving.</strong> In a clear hint that tomorrow\u2019s GDP figures will show Britain is out of recession, Cameron told Ed Miliband: \u201cI can tell him, the good news will keep coming.\u201d Cameron also said that, overall, Britain was on the right track.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is what\u2019s happening in the country; inflation, down; unemployment, down; crime, down; waiting lists, down; borrowing, down.</p> </blockquote> <p>Number 10 later said Cameron\u2019s line about the good news still coming was not a reference to the growth figures, although the prime minister\u2019s spokesman did not deny that Cameron had seen the figures (which are released to key Whitehall figures 24 hours in advance). Miliband used PMQs to mock Cameron over the west coast mainline fiasco, over the energy announcement last week that subsequently had to be clarified and over the resignation of the chief whip. Miliband said the energy policy had \u201ctotally unravelled\u201d and was \u201canother dodgy offer from this prime minister\u201d.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Cameron has agreed to look into allegations that a paedophile network may have had links to a senior aide a former prime minister.</strong> The Labour MP Tom Watson raised the case during PMQs.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The evidence file used to convict Peter Righton, if it still exists, contains clear intelligence of a widespread paedophile ring. One of its members boasts of his links to a senior aide of a former prime minister, who says he could smuggle indecent images of children from abroad. The leads were not followed up, but if the files still exist, I want to ensure that the Metropolitan police secure the evidence, re-examine it and investigate clear intelligence suggesting a powerful paedophile network linked to parliament and No 10.</p> </blockquote> <p>Watson did not name the senior aide, or the prime minister for whom he worked, and Cameron said he was not sure which prime minister Watson was referring to. But he said he would look at the case carefully and see if he could give Watson the assurances he wanted.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Cameron has said that <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/oct/23/alex-salmond-eu-legal-advice-scotland?INTCMP=SRCH\">the controversy about Alex Salmond\u2019s allegedly lying over legal advice relating to Scottish independence</a> shows that the case for separation \u201ccompletely falls apart\u201d under scrutiny.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 Cameron has refused to rule out introducing some form of statutory regulation following the publication of the Leveson report.</strong> When the Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg asked him to accept that statutory press regulation was incompatible with a free press, Cameron refused. \u201cWhat matters most is that we have a regulatory system in which the public can have confidence,\u201d Cameron said.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Cameron has said that he is \u201cnot happy\u201d with the way large multinational companies minimise their tax payments in the UK.</strong> Labour\u2019s Margaret Hodge said that Apple, Google, Facebook, eBay and Starburks were avoiding tax worth nearly \u00a3900m. Cameron agreed this was a problem.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This is an international problem about how to make sure that companies pay tax in an appropriate way, I\u2019m not happy with the current situation, the HMRC needs to look at it, we need to make sure these companies are investing in our country but we need to make sure they are paying taxes as well.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2012/oct/24/jimmy-savile-scandal-culture-secretary\">Maria Miller, the culture secretary, has defended her decision to write to the BBC about its handling of the Jimmy Savile controversy</a>.</strong> \u201cIt was right the government reflect the deep level of concern,\u201d she said today, in a move likely to escalate the row between the government and the BBC over this issue. In a separate development, the Tory MP Sir Roger Gale, a former BBC producer, said the Savile affair could lead to Chris Patten, the chairman of the BBC Trust, and George Entwistle, the director general, having to resign.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>BBC management, over far too many years, has sought to maintain an imperious disdain for criticism and it has become clear that successive directors general have, while happy to criticise others for not answering difficult questions, either turned a blind eye to criminal activities or have not known what has been going on on their own doorstep, which is also culpable.</p> <p>It is as if your favourite and respectable aunt has been revealed to be on the game, and if Lord Patten is not able to grasp that, then I fear that not only the director general but also the chairman of the BBC Trust are going to have to fall on their swords.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 Number 10 has said that the proposed 6.8% increase in the EU budget approved by MEPs yesterday is \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d.</strong> Asked about the vote in the European parliament yesterday, the prime minister\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cWe think European budgets need to reflect the context, which is that countries across Europe are having to take some very tough decisions on public spending. I think we look at that proposal from the European parliament and it is just completely unacceptable.\u201d</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Theresa May, the home secretary, has said that the threat to Great Britain from Northern Ireland-related terrorism has been downgraded from substantial to moderate.</strong> She made the announcement in a written statement to MPs.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Today the Security Service reduced the threat level to Great Britain from Northern Ireland-related terrorism from substantial to moderate. This means that a terrorist attack is possible, but not likely. The threat level to the UK from international terrorism remains at substantial, which means that an attack is a strong possibility. The threat level to Northern Ireland from Northern Ireland-related terrorism remains at severe, meaning that an attack is highly likely. Neither of these two levels has changed.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 The Conservative MP Nadine Dorries has called George Osborne a liar who is not up to the job of being chancellor.</strong> In<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/10/24/nadine-dorries-george-osborne-is-a-pernicious-influence-on-david-cameron_n_2007992.html?1351070858&amp;utm_hp_ref=uk-politics\"> an interview with the Huffington Post,</a> she said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think George Osborne is out of his depth. He might be a politician and a strategist and a political campaigner.

Asked about Osborne\u2019s comment, she told the Huffington Post: \u201cOsborne lied when he said that. Osborne and I have worked together for years. We worked together in Oliver Letwin\u2019s office for three years, from 2001, when I wasn\u2019t an MP, and I got to know George Osborne quite well.

Actually what the United Kingdom should do is not specified and it is quite clear that there is a great deal of latitude in respect of what the United Kingdom can do in respect of implementing the Scoppola judgment ...</p> <p>The United Kingdom government is adherent to the convention. The convention is one of our international legal obligations. And successive governments, including this one, have always put a great emphasis on the observance of our international legal obligations. We live in a world where international law matters increasingly ... We do observe international obligations that are imposed on us.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said Britain's reputation would suffer if it ignored the ruling.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The issue is whether the United Kingdom wishes to be in breach of its obligations, and what that does reputationally.</p> <p>Inevitably, if we were to be in default of a judgment in the European court of human rights, whilst clearly there would be some people who could put forward logical arguments as to why we should be, equally I have absolutely no doubt that it would be seen by other countries as a move away from our strict adherence to human rights laws.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said there was considerable flexibility in how the ruling could be implemented.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are numerous ways in which government or parliament might, could, if it wished to, approach the issue of change to the blanket ban, and that that approach need not necessarily be entirely in the direction that we have got to give more convicted prisoners the vote. There is an inbuilt flexibility in the&#xa0;Scoppola judgment which wasn\u2019t really present in [an early judgment from the court in this case].</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He refused to say whether there would be a draft bill published on the matter.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that ultimately parliament could decide to ignore the European court if it wanted.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It is entirely a matter for parliament ultimately ... to determine what it wants to do. Parliament is sovereign in this area. Nobody can impose a solution on parliament.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said ministers were obliged under the ministerial code to honour their international legal obligations.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>But, as I say, the accepted practice is that the United Kingdom observes its international obligations. And that is something that is spelt out in a number of places, including the ministerial code.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He rejected a suggestion from the Tory MP Nick de Bois that nothing would happen to the UK if it ignored the European court.</strong> In theory, the UK could even be thrown out of the Council of Europe, he said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I\u2019m not in a position to speculate one way or another what the outcome would be if the United Kingdom government and parliament decided not to respond to the&#xa0;Scoppola judgment. What would happen in practice is a matter of speculation ...</p> <p>As to what the end game would be, whether it would mean that the United Kingdom decided to leave the Council of Europe, or be expelled from the Council of Europe, I don\u2019t think I would wish to hazard a guess. But it is at least technically possible that a country that is in breach of its obligations can be removed.</p> </blockquote> <p>He said that this had only happened once, to Greece in the 1960s, after the military staged a coup.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said ignoring the ruling would be \"costly\" to the government.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There\u2019s an issue, I think, that has been canvassed previously, that there would be damages claims stacking up against the United Kingdom government in respect of individual prisoners who would claim that their right to vote had been denied them.

  "<p>Barack Obama's re-election team is making an all-out push to reach undecided voters in Ohio in the hope that the president's superior ground operation will give him the edge in the vital swing state despite tightening polls.</p> <p>Obama for America, the re-election operation masterminded in Chicago, is waging the most intensive ground operation in US electoral history in Ohio. It has blanketed the state with 125 field offices and is sending out an army of volunteers, backed by the latest digital technology, to hunt down the 3% of voters who have yet to make up their minds.</p> <p>The Obama campaign has built its ground game on the back of his first run on the presidency in 2008, providing an almost unbroken presence in Ohio in stark contrast to the relatively new operation that Mitt Romney has created from scratch over the past six months. Democratic organizers hope that such long-term commitment to the state will give them an advantage as the election enters the final stage devoted to getting out the vote.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-250_162-57536922/poll-obamas-lead-in-ohio-narrows/?tag=nl.e879&amp;s_cid=e879\">latest opinion poll from Quinnipiac University and CBS News</a> shows Obama hanging on to a five-point lead in Ohio by 50% to 45%. But that has come down following his poor performance in the first presidential debate from a commanding advantage of 10 points just a month ago, and any further slide would see the state enter a statistical tie.</p> <p>To prevent any additional drift, the campaign is piling resources into Ohio. Among the big names parachuted into the state in recent days were the double act of Bill Clinton and Bruce Springsteen. Another double act \u2013 that of Obama and Joe Biden \u2013 took the stage in Dayton on Tuesday.</p> <p>At a local level, the final stretch of the campaign is being buoyed up by celebrities of a slightly more modest hew. Volunteers in the college town of Bowling Green in north-west Ohio were treated to a visit by Crystal Bowersox, an American Idol finalist best known for her white dreadlocks and her penchant for appearing barefoot.</p> <p>She may not be in the same league as the Boss, but Bowersox was able to fire up the volunteers. \"You guys know what's at stake, otherwise you wouldn't be here,\" she said to a gathering of about 30 volunteers, mainly women, about to go out canvassing.</p> <p>\"Being a woman is not a pre-existing condition, and we reserve the right to choose. Taking away the right to contraception is a terrible threat to women trying to sustain themselves financially.\"</p> <p>Talking to the Guardian, Bowersox said she was informed by her own personal experience. Born in nearby Oak Harbor in Ohio, she was dependent on government subsidy for healthcare when she was struggling as a musician \u2013 and she gives thanks to welfare and Medicaid in the cover notes to her first album, Farmer's Daughter.</p> <p>\"I'm a different tax bracket now, and I've seen both sides of the fence. But I'm still grateful for the help I got when I was dirt poor,\" she said.</p> <p>The Obama canvassing operation in Bowling Green, as in other key constituencies across the country, is powered by a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/14/obama-digital-campaigning-dashboard\">sophisticated set of digital tools</a> developed for this election cycle called Dashboard. This takes the Democratic party's database, Vote Builder, which contains personal data on millions of individuals, and connects it to volunteers knocking on doors.</p> <p>By so doing, it allows for an increasingly fine-tuned targeting of core voters. Committed conservatives and Romney supporters can be discounted as it is not worth spending time trying to persuade them.</p> <p>Instead, Dashboard directs canvassers to the doors of firm Democrats who can be encouraged to vote early, which is an advantage to the campaign because it means that more effort can be focused on election day on getting wavering voters to the polls.</p> <h2>'Good data can be the difference between winning and losing'</h2> <p>The Obama for America re-election campaign is claiming that it has built up a substantial lead in early voting so far. Jeremy Bird, the national field director, <a href=\"https://secure.assets.bostatic.com/pdfs/Memo_from_Jeremy_Bird.pdf\">put out a memo this weekend</a> in which he said: \"President Obama is winning early vote among primary election voters in the key battleground of Ohio.\"</p> <p>The contention appears to be born out by a slew of polls that has Obama ahead among those who have already cast their vote. <a href=\"http://www.surveyusa.com/client/PollReport.aspx?g=9fe706c7-86ef-4698-b0d3-15ec2d79d203\">One by SurveyUSA</a>, for instance, put Obama ahead by 19 points among early voters.</p> <p>Joe McNamara, Democratic president of Toledo city council just to the north of Bowling Green, says the concentration on early voting could win Obama the state. \"Get people to the polls now and you can concentrate your forces on those who haven't decided yet.\"</p> <p>McNamara says the Obama ground game is more organised than any election he has ever seen. \"They are all about the data \u2013 where to knock, what the responses were, who has voted early, who needs a ride to the polls. Having good data can be the difference between winning and losing.\"</p> <p>The Obama office in Bowling Green, a college town, is running daily golf carts to carry students form campus to the early polling stations. But most of the team's energies are being directed, with Dashboard's help, towards the undecided voters upon which the outcome of the election in Ohio will depend.</p> <p>\"We know that turning up in person is far more effective than the millions of dollars being spent on TV ads this year,\" said Emily Garcia, an 18-year-old student at Bowling Green State University who is devoting 20 hours a week to the campaign. \"People appreciate that we are taking the trouble to talk to them in their homes.\"</p> <p>Through Dashboard, Garcia is directed \u2013 theoretically at least \u2013 to the doorsteps of the undecided voters. The technology draws on past voting behaviour, data scraped from social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter, occupation, age, gender and other demographic details to estimate individual's likely voting position.</p> <p>It doesn't always work. The first door Garcia knocked on on Sunday afternoon was an older woman who complained: \"What do you want? I didn't order pizza.\" She turned out to be a committed Romney supporter.</p> <p>But the second door was a hit. Craig Flack, 25, is an evangelical pastor with a Bowling Green congregation and has yet to decide which way to vote on 6 November.</p> <p>He knows how valuable a political catch he is. \"I'm like a unicorn in Ohio \u2013 one of the 3% of Ohio voters everyone wants to talk to,\" he said.</p> <p>Contrary to the popular image of the undecided voter as being ignorant and unengaged \u2013 a recent Saturday Night Live skit <a href=\"http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/undecided-voter/1418227\">captured the stereotype brilliantly</a> \u2013 Flack is a political science graduate who is following the race closely. He voted for Obama in 2008 but says he has grown disillusioned.</p> <p>\"Like everyone else I drank the Kool-Aid \u2013 it was all going to be peaches and cream. But after four years where's the hope and change?\"</p> <p>He is now torn between the candidates. On the one hand, he is very worried about the size of the national debt and what he perceives as Obama's failure to bring it down; on the other he likes the president's healthcare reforms and doesn't want them to be repealed. \"I don't think you should have to go broke just because you fall sick.\"</p> <p>Garcia tries to entice Flack into the Obama camp as they stand debating on his doorstep. \"I totally get that the deficit is a big thing, but the economy Obama inherited was totally destroyed. Four years is not enough to fix that \u2013 give him another four and he'll get the deficit down.\"</p> <p>\"But no human being gets to live like that,\" Flack replies. \"We have a budget in my church and in my family, and we have to stick within it. We can't just keep on spending.\"</p> <p>They part with Flack still undecided, though he professes to be \"leaning Obama\". He may regret making that comment, as it will almost certainly earn him many more calls and visits from Garcia and her fellow Obama volunteers before this race is done.</p>",

  "<p>More than 70 rockets have been fired into southern Israel from Gaza since the departure on Tuesday of the emir of Qatar, whose <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/23/qatari-emir-welcome-gaza-visit\" title=\"\">visit to the Gaza Strip was seen as a boost for its ruling faction, Hamas</a>. Three foreign agricultural workers were injured and several buildings were hit.</p> <p>Four militants were killed in resurgent Israeli air strikes overnight as a short period of calm ended. Three were members of Hamas's military wing, the Ezzedin al-Qassam brigades, according to reports on its website.</p> <p>Hamas, which normally distances itself from rocket fire from Gaza, has claimed responsibility for some operations in recent days. \"These holy missions come in response to the repeated, continuous crimes of the enemy against our people, which killed four and injured 10 in the past 48 hours,\" it said in a statement.</p> <p>Israel's defence minister, Ehud Barak, said he would order whatever action was necessary to stop rocket fire from Gaza. \"If a ground operation will be necessary, there will be a ground operation. Nobody is eager for this but we will act as we are required to stop this wave and to increase the effectiveness of the operation.\"</p> <p>Israeli tanks have fired into Gaza in addition to air strikes, according to reports. Schools in both southern Israel and central Gaza were closed on Wednesday, and the Israeli authorities shut crossing points to the enclave.</p> <p>Both Israel and Hamas are thought to want to avoid an escalation into full-scale conflict. But if Israeli casualties resulted from rocket fire, Israel would be expected to engage in a more sustained assault than targeted assassinations.</p> <p>Hamas is also under pressure from more radical organisations within Gaza, which may explain its unusual open participation in this latest round of violence. \"Hamas feels a tension between the need to be a government [in Gaza] and the need to be part of the resistance [to Israel]. It has in its ranks quite a few people who co-operate with the more radical groups,\" Yossi Kuperwasser, the director general of Israel's ministry of strategic affairs, told reporters in a briefing last week.</p> <p>Weapons were \"pouring in\" to Gaza, he added. \"Everyone is extremely busy building a terror infrastructure. Libya is a new and very important source of weapons. The arming process is very intensive and with it comes a growing tendency to use such arms.\"</p> <p>Earlier this month, an anti-aircraft missile was fired from Gaza for the first time at an Israeli military helicopter, according to Israeli defence officials. The shoulder-fired Strela missile missed its target.</p> <p>The visit by the Qatari emir\u201a the first head of state to visit Gaza under Hamas rule, was seen as conferring legitimacy on the Islamist organisation. Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani also announced a $400m investment and construction programme for Gaza.</p>",
  "<p>It is remarkable that social security hasn't been a more prominent issue in the presidential race. After all, Governor Romney has proposed a plan that would imply cuts of more than 40% for middle-class workers just <a href=\"http://www.mittromney.com/issues/social-security\">entering the labor force</a>. Since social security is <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/ 2011/07/21/cnnorc-poll-july-18-21-debt-ceiling/\">hugely popular </a>across the political spectrum, it would seem that President Obama could gain an enormous advantage by clearly proclaiming his support for the program.</p> <p>But President Obama has consistently refused to rise to the defense of social security. In fact, in the first debate, he explicitly took the issue off the table, telling the American people that there is not much difference between his <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rj-eskow/town-hall-debate_b_1965681.html\">position</a> on social security and Romney's.</p> <p>On its face, this is difficult to understand. In addition to being good politics, there are also solid policy grounds for defending social security. The social security system is perhaps the greatest success story of any program in US history. By providing a core retirement income, it has lifted tens of millions of retirees and their families out of poverty. It also provides disability insurance to almost the entire workforce. The amount of fraud in the system is minimal, and the administrative costs are <a href=\"http://www.globalaging.org/pension/us/socialsec/myth.htm\">less than</a> one 20th as large as the costs of private-sector insurers.</p> <p>In addition, the program is more necessary now than ever. The economic mismanagement of the last two decades has left the baby boomers ill-prepared for retirement \u2013 few have traditional pensions. The stock market crashes of the last 15 years <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-callahan/401k-a-perfect-failure_b_1574834.html\">have left</a> 401(k)s depleted, and the collapse of the housing bubble destroyed much of their housing equity, which has always been the main source of wealth for middle-income families.</p> <p>It would be great if we had reason to believe that the generations that followed had better retirement prospects, but we don't. Even in good times, the 401(k) system does more to enrich the financial industry than to provide a secure retirement income. Any reasonable projection indicates that social security will provide the bulk of retirement income for most middle-class retirees long into the future. In this context, the idea of cutting back benefits, even for younger workers, seems misguided.</p> <p>But there is another set of economic considerations affecting the politics of social security. These considerations involve the economics of the political campaigns and the candidates running for office. The story here is a simple one: while social security may enjoy overwhelming support across the political spectrum, it does not poll nearly as well among the wealthy people \u2013 who finance political campaigns and own major news outlets. The predominant philosophy among this group is that a dollar in a workers' pocket is a dollar that could be in a rich person's pocket \u2013 and these people see social security putting lots of dollars in the pockets of people who are not rich.</p> <p>Cutting back benefits could mean delays in repaying the government bonds held by the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_Trust_Fund\">Trust Fund</a>. The money to repay these bonds would come primarily from a relatively progressive income tax revenue. The wealthy certainly don't want to see changes like raising the cap on wages that are subject to the social security tax, which is currently<a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wnet/need-to-know/transcripts-full-episode/transcript-october-12-2012/15143/\"> just over</a> $110,000.</p> <p>For this reason, a candidate who comes out for protecting social security can expect to see a hit to their campaign contributions. They also can anticipate being beaten up in both the opinion and news sections of major media outlets. While, in principle, these are supposed to be kept strictly separate, the owners and/or top management of most news outlets feel no qualms about removing this separation when it comes to social security \u2013 and using news space to attack those who defend social security.</p> <p>There is also the flip side to this story. Politicians, especially Democrats, who speak up for cuts to social security can count on lavish praise from the media. Political figures of no obvious stature, like former Louisiana Senator <a href=\"http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1000403,00.html\">John Breaux</a> or former Indiana Senator <a href=\"http://www.ontheissues.org/Senate/Evan_Bayh.htm#Social_Security\">Evan Bayh</a>, were lionized in the media for their willingness to cut social security benefits. After leaving the Senate, both took lobbying positions where they were almost certainly earning well over $1m a year.</p> <p>This is the fundamental economics of social security that explains why it has not figured more prominently in the presidential race. If President Obama were to rise in defense of the program, he could count on losing the financial backing of many supporters. He would also get beaten up by the Washington Post and other major news outlets for challenging their agenda.</p> <p>Such are the hard economic facts with which President Obama and other politicians must contend.</p>",
  "<p><strong>(updated below - Update II - Update III)</strong></p> <p>A primary reason for opposing the acquisition of abusive powers and civil liberties erosions is that they virtually always become permanent, vested not only in current leaders one may love and trust but also future officials who seem more menacing and less benign. </p> <p>The Washington Post has a <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/plan-for-hunting-terrorists-signals-us-intends-to-keep-adding-names-to-kill-lists/2012/10/23/4789b2ae-18b3-11e2-a55c-39408fbe6a4b_story.html\">crucial and disturbing story</a> this morning by Greg Miller about the concerted efforts by the Obama administration to fully institutionalize \u2013 to make officially permanent \u2013 the most extremist powers it has exercised in the name of the war on terror. </p> <p>Based on interviews with \"current and former officials from the White House and the Pentagon, as well as intelligence and counterterrorism agencies\", Miller reports that as \"the United States' conventional wars are winding down\", the Obama administration \"expects to continue adding names to kill or capture lists for years\" (the \"capture\" part of that list is little more than symbolic, as the US focus is <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/05/14/chomsky_on_obama/\">overwhelmingly on the \"kill\" part</a>). Specifically, \"among senior Obama administration officials, there is broad consensus that such operations are likely to be extended at least another decade.\" As Miller puts it: \"That timeline suggests that the United States has reached only the midpoint of what was once known as the global war on terrorism.\"</p> <p>In pursuit of this goal, \"White House counterterrorism adviser John O Brennan is seeking to codify the administration's approach to generating capture/kill lists, part of a broader effort to guide future administrations through the counterterrorism processes that Obama has embraced.\" All of this, writes Miller, demonstrates \"the extent to which Obama has institutionalized the highly classified practice of targeted killing, transforming ad-hoc elements into a counterterrorism infrastructure capable of sustaining a seemingly permanent war.\" </p> <p>The Post article cites numerous recent developments reflecting this Obama effort, including the fact that \"CIA Director David H Petraeus is pushing for an expansion of the agency's fleet of armed drones\", which \"reflects the agency's transformation into a paramilitary force, and makes clear that it does not intend to dismantle its drone program and return to its pre-September 11 focus on gathering intelligence.\" The article also describes rapid expansion of commando operations by the US Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) and, perhaps most disturbingly, the creation of a permanent bureaucratic infrastructure to allow the president to assassinate at will:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"JSOC also has established a secret targeting center across the Potomac River from Washington, current and former U.S. officials said. The elite command's targeting cells have traditionally been located near the front lines of its missions, including in Iraq and Afghanistan. But JSOC created a 'national capital region' task force that is a 15-minute commute from the White House so it could be more directly involved in deliberations about al-Qaeda lists.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The creepiest aspect of this development is the christening of a new Orwellian euphemism for due-process-free presidential assassinations: \"disposition matrix\". Writes Miller:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Over the past two years, the Obama administration has been secretly developing a new blueprint for pursuing terrorists, a next-generation targeting list called the 'disposition matrix'.</p> <p>\"The matrix contains the names of terrorism suspects arrayed against an accounting of the resources being marshaled to track them down, including sealed indictments and clandestine operations. US officials said the database is designed to go beyond existing kill lists, mapping plans for the 'disposition' of suspects beyond the reach of American drones.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>The \"disposition matrix\" has been developed and will be overseen by the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC). One of its purposes is \"to augment\" the \"separate but overlapping kill lists\" maintained by the CIA and the Pentagon: to serve, in other words, as the centralized clearinghouse for determining who will be executed without due process based upon how one fits into the executive branch's \"matrix\". As Miller describes it, it is \"a single, continually evolving database\" which includes \"biographies, locations, known associates and affiliated organizations\" as well as \"strategies for taking targets down, including extradition requests, capture operations and drone patrols\". This analytical system that determines people's \"disposition\" will undoubtedly be kept completely secret; Marcy Wheeler <a href=\"https://twitter.com/emptywheel/status/260906328980086786\">sardonically said</a> that she was \"looking forward to the government's arguments explaining why it won't release the disposition matrix to ACLU under FOIA\".</p> <p>This was all motivated by Obama's refusal to arrest or detain terrorist suspects, and his resulting commitment simply to killing them at will (his will). Miller quotes \"a former US counterterrorism official involved in developing the matrix\" as explaining the impetus behind the program this way: \"We had a disposition problem.\"</p> <p>The central role played by the NCTC in determining who should be killed \u2013 \"It is the keeper of the criteria,\" says one official to the Post \u2013 is, by itself, rather odious. As Kade Crockford of the ACLU of Massachusetts <a href=\"http://privacysos.org/node/857\">noted in response to this story</a>, the ACLU <a href=\"http://www.aclu.org/blog/national-security-technology-and-liberty/biggest-new-spying-program-youve-probably-never-heard\">has long warned</a> that the real purpose of the NCTC \u2013 despite its nominal focus on terrorism - is the \"massive, secretive data collection and mining of trillions of points of data about most people in the United States\". </p> <p>In particular, the NCTC operates a gigantic data-mining operation, in which all sorts of information about innocent Americans is systematically monitored, stored, and analyzed. This includes \"records from law enforcement investigations, health information, employment history, travel and student records\" \u2013 \"literally anything the government collects would be fair game\". In other words, the NCTC - now vested with the power to determine the proper \"disposition\" of terrorist suspects - is the same agency that is at the center of the ubiquitous, unaccountable surveillance state aimed at American citizens.</p> <p>Worse still, as the ACLU's legislative counsel Chris Calabrese documented back in July <a href=\"http://www.aclu.org/blog/national-security-technology-and-liberty/biggest-new-spying-program-youve-probably-never-heard\">in a must-read analysis</a>, Obama officials very recently abolished safeguards on how this information can be used. Whereas the agency, during the Bush years, was barred from storing non-terrorist-related information about innocent Americans for more than 180 days \u2013 a limit which \"meant that NCTC was dissuaded from collecting large databases filled with information on innocent Americans\" \u2013 it is now free to do so. Obama officials eliminated this constraint by authorizing the NCTC \"to collect and 'continually assess' information on innocent Americans for up to five years\". </p> <p>And, as usual, this agency engages in these incredibly powerful and invasive processes with virtually no democratic accountability:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"All of this is happening with very little oversight. Controls over the NCTC are mostly internal to the DNI's office, and important oversight bodies such as Congress and the President's Intelligence Oversight Board aren't notified even of 'significant' failures to comply with the Guidelines. Fundamental legal protections are being sidestepped. For example, under the new guidelines, Privacy Act notices (legal requirements to describe how databases are used) must be completed by the agency that collected the information. This is in spite of the fact that those agencies have no idea what NCTC is actually doing with the information once it collects it.</p> <p>\"All of this amounts to a reboot of the Total Information Awareness Program that Americans rejected so vigorously right after 9/11.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>It doesn't require any conspiracy theorizing to see what's happening here. Indeed, it takes extreme naivet\u00e9, or wilful blindness, not to see it.</p> <p>What has been created here - permanently institutionalized - is a highly secretive executive branch agency that simultaneously engages in two functions: (1) it collects and analyzes massive amounts of surveillance data about all Americans without any judicial review let alone search warrants, and (2) creates and implements a \"matrix\" that determines the \"disposition\" of suspects, up to and including execution, without a whiff of due process or oversight. It is simultaneously a surveillance state and a secretive, unaccountable judicial body that analyzes who you are and then decrees what should be done with you, how you should be \"disposed\" of, beyond the reach of any minimal accountability or transparency. </p> <p>The Post's Miller recognizes the watershed moment this represents: \"The creation of the matrix and the institutionalization of kill/capture lists reflect a shift that is as psychological as it is strategic.\" As he explains, extra-judicial assassination was once deemed so extremist that very extensive deliberations were required before Bill Clinton could target even Osama bin Laden for death by lobbing cruise missiles in East Africa. But:</p> <blockquote> <p>Targeted killing is now so routine that the Obama administration has spent much of the past year codifying and streamlining the processes that sustain it.</p> </blockquote> <p>To understand the Obama legacy, please re-read that sentence. As Murtaza Hussain <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MazMHussain/status/260898386000089091\">put it</a> when reacting to the Post story: \"The US agonized over the targeted killing Bin Laden at Tarnak Farms in 1998; now it kills people it barely suspects of anything on a regular basis.\"</p> <p>The pragmatic inanity of the mentality driving this is self-evident: as I <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/23/klein-drones-morning-joe\">discussed yesterday</a> (and many other times), continuous killing does not eliminate violence aimed at the US but rather guarantees its permanent expansion. As a result, wrote Miller, \"officials said no clear end is in sight\" when it comes to the war against \"terrorists\" because, said one official, \"we can't possibly kill everyone who wants to harm us\" but trying is \"a necessary part of what we do\". Of course, the more the US kills and kills and kills, the more people there are who \"want to harm us\". That's the logic that has resulted in a permanent war on terror.</p> <p>But even more significant is the truly radical vision of government in which this is all grounded. The core guarantee of western justice since the Magna Carta was codified in the US by the <a href=\"http://www.usconstitution.net/xconst_Am5.html\">fifth amendment to the constitution</a>: \"No person shall . . . be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\" You simply cannot have a free society, a worthwhile political system, without that guarantee, that constraint on the ultimate abusive state power, being honored.</p> <p>And yet what the Post is describing, what we have had for years, is a system of government that \u2013 without hyperbole \u2013 is the very antithesis of that liberty. It is literally impossible to imagine a more violent repudiation of the basic blueprint of the republic than the development of a secretive, totally unaccountable executive branch agency that simultaneously collects information about all citizens and then applies a \"disposition matrix\" to determine what punishment should be meted out. This is classic political dystopia brought to reality (despite how compelled such a conclusion is by these indisputable facts, many Americans will view such a claim as an exaggeration, paranoia, or worse because of <a href=\"http://ggsidedocs.blogspot.com.br/2012/09/believing-oppression-only-happens.html\">this psychological dynamic I described here</a> which leads many good passive westerners to believe that true oppression, by definition, is something that happens only elsewhere).</p> <p>In response to the Post story, Chris Hayes <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chrislhayes/status/260908192643575810\">asked</a>: \"If you have a 'kill list', but the list keeps growing, are you succeeding?\" The answer all depends upon what the objective is.</p> <p>As the Founders all recognized, nothing vests elites with power \u2013 and profit \u2013 more than a state of war. That is why there were supposed to be substantial barriers to having them start and continue - the need for a Congressional declaration, the <a href=\"http://www.usconstitution.net/xconst_A1Sec8.html\">constitutional bar</a> on funding the military for more than two years at a time, the prohibition on standing armies, etc. Here is how John Jay <a href=\"http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed04.asp\">put it in Federalist No 4</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"It is too true, however disgraceful it may be to human nature, that nations in general will make war whenever they have a prospect of getting anything by it; nay, absolute monarchs will often make war when their nations are to get nothing by it, but for the purposes and objects merely personal, such as thirst for military glory, revenge for personal affronts, ambition, or private compacts to aggrandize or support their particular families or partisans. These and a variety of other motives, which affect only the mind of the sovereign, often lead him to engage in wars not sanctified by justice or the voice and interests of his people.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>In sum, there are factions in many governments that crave a state of endless war because that is when power is least constrained and profit most abundant. What the Post is reporting is yet another significant step toward that state, and it is undoubtedly driven, at least on the part of some, by a self-interested desire to ensure the continuation of endless war and the powers and benefits it vests. So to answer Hayes' question: the endless expansion of a kill list and the unaccountable, always-expanding powers needed to implement it does indeed represent a great success for many. Read what John Jay wrote in the above passage to see why that is, and why few, if any, political developments should be regarded as more pernicious.</p> <h2>Detention policies</h2> <p>Assuming the Post's estimates are correct \u2013 that \"among senior Obama administration officials, there is broad consensus that such operations are likely to be extended at least another decade\" \u2013 this means that the war on terror will last for more than 20 years, far longer than any other American war. This is what has always made the rationale for indefinite detention \u2013 that it is permissible to detain people without due process until the \"end of hostilities\" \u2013 so warped in this context. Those who are advocating that are endorsing nothing less than life imprisonment - permanent incarceration \u2013 without any charges or opportunities to contest the accusations.</p> <p>That people are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/11/guantanamo-prisoner-death-democrats\">now dying at Guantanamo</a> after almost a decade in a cage with no charges highlights just how repressive that power is. Extend that mentality to secret, due-process-free assassinations \u2013 something the US government clearly intends to convert into a permanent fixture of American political life \u2013 and it is not difficult to see just how truly extremist and anti-democratic \"war on terror\" proponents in both political parties have become.</p> <h2>UPDATE</h2> <p>As I noted yesterday, Afghan officials <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/23/us-afghanistan-taliban-idUSBRE89M0N120121023\">reported that</a> three Afghan children were killed on Saturday by NATO operations. Today, <a href=\"http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2012/10/24/3-killed-kids-hurt-as-fury-grows-over-u-s-drone-strikes-in-pakistan/\">reports CNN</a>, \"missiles blew up part of a compound Wednesday in northwest Pakistan, killing three people - including one woman\" and added: \"the latest suspected U.S. drone strike also injured two children.\" Meanwhile, former Obama press secretary and current campaign adviser Robert Gibbs <a href=\"http://dissenter.firedoglake.com/2012/10/23/obama-adviser-robert-gibbs-blames-denver-teens-terrorist-father-for-his-drone-death/\">this week justified</a> the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-airstrike-that-killed-american-teen-in-yemen-raises-legal-ethical-questions/2011/10/20/gIQAdvUY7L_story.html\">US killing of 16-year-old American Abdulrahaman Awlaki</a>, killed by a US drone in Yemen two weeks after his father was, on the ground that he \"should have a far more responsible father\".</p> <p>Also yesterday, <a href=\"http://security.blogs.cnn.com/2012/10/23/al-qaeda-figure-comes-back-to-life-in-yemen/\">CNN profiled</a> Abu Sufyan Said al-Shihri, alleged to be a top al-Qaida official in Yemen. He pointed out \"that U.S. drone strikes are helping al-Qaida in Yemen because of the number of civilian deaths they cause.\" <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/in-yemen-us-airstrikes-breed-anger-and-sympathy-for-al-qaeda/2012/05/29/gJQAUmKI0U_story.html\">Ample evidence</a> supports his observation.</p> <p>To summarize all this: the US does not interfere in the Muslim world and maintain an endless war on terror because of the terrorist threat. It has a terrorist threat because of its interference in the Muslim world and its endless war on terror.</p> <h2>UPDATE II</h2> <p>The Council on Foreign Relations' Micah Zenko, writing today about the Post article, <a href=\"http://blogs.cfr.org/zenko/2012/10/24/institutionalizing-americas-targeted-killing-program/\">reports</a>:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Recently, I spoke to a military official with extensive and wide-ranging experience in the special operations world, and who has had direct exposure to the targeted killing program. To emphasize how easy targeted killings by special operations forces or drones has become, this official flicked his hand back over and over, stating: 'It really is like swatting flies. We can do it forever easily and you feel nothing. But how often do you really think about killing a fly?'\"</p> </blockquote> <p>That is disturbingly consistent with <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-rise-of-the-killer-drones-how-america-goes-to-war-in-secret-20120416?print=true\">prior reports</a> that the military's term for drone victims is \"bug splat\". This - this warped power and the accompanying dehumanizing mindset - is what is being institutionalized as a permanent fixture in American political life by the current president.</p> <h2>UPDATE III</h2> <p>At Wired, Spencer Ackerman reacts to the Post article with <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/10/disposition-matrix/\">an analysis</a> entitled \"President Romney Can Thank Obama for His Permanent Robotic Death List\". Here is his concluding paragraph:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"Obama did not run for president to preside over the codification of a global war fought in secret. But that's his legacy. . . . Micah Zenko at the Council on Foreign Relations writes that Obama's predecessors in the Bush administration 'were actually much more conscious and thoughtful about the long-term implications of targeted killings', because they feared the political consequences that might come when the U.S. embraces something at least superficially similar to assassination. Whoever follows Obama in the Oval Office can thank him for proving those consequences don't meaningfully exist \u2014 as he or she reviews the backlog of names on the Disposition Matrix.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>It's worth devoting a moment to letting that sink in.</p>",

  "<p><strong>\"Training for a marathon and reading about </strong><a href=\"http://www.thepowerof10.info/athletes/profile.aspx?athleteid=38667\" title=\"\"><strong>Ronnie O'Sullivan's none-too-shabby amateur running career</strong></a><strong>, some friends and I were wondering if any top-flight footballers have ever run a serious 10k or marathon and how they fared,\" </strong>writes Ben Smith. <strong>\"Any ideas?\"</strong></p> <p>The Leeds 10k in July of this year numbered among its runners several men who, while not exactly top-flight footballers, do share a pitch with them every weekend. The referees Howard Webb, Phil Dowd, Martin Atkinson, Michael Jones and Jon Moss pounded the roads of Yorkshire for charity and registered respectable times. Webb was quickest, striding home in 46min 41sec, with Jones narrowly behind in 47.34, followed by Atkinson at 47.45, a time matched by Moss, while Dowd brought up the rear in 50.04.</p> <p>Going the extra mile (or six) in October last year was the Swindon manager Paolo Di Canio, who ended up running the Swindon half-marathon by mistake. The former West Ham forward was the official starter of the race and successfully sounded the starting gun before heading off on the two-mile fun run.</p> <p>The Italian, though, took a wrong turn and ended up running the whole 13.1 miles in his full Swindon kit. \"I couldn't stop, there was a challenge,\" he said after finishing in 1hr 49min. \"There were three options, I thought I should start with the fun [run] marathon but unfortunately we changed direction, kept going and followed the first group.\"</p> <p>\"Unfortunately I ended up doing a full half marathon plus 800 metres. At the end I was very happy because I finished without stopping, even for one second. I wasn't ready but I never stopped running. I'm very happy but it was very tough.\"</p> <p>At the full 26.2 mile distance, it tends to be former footballers running for charity rather than irascible Italian managers losing their way on a fun run. Some take it rather more seriously than others and the quickest time we've been able to find in the record books is the scintillating <a href=\"http://results-2011.virginlondonmarathon.com/2011/index.php?content=detail&amp;fpid=search&amp;pid=search&amp;id=0000030F5ECC83000003567D&amp;lang=EN&amp;event=MAS&amp;ageclass=\" title=\"\">3hr 22min 36sec</a> run of the former Leicester midfielder Muzzy Izzet in the 2011 London marathon.</p> <p>\"I think I was 12 minutes off the time needed for an elite start so that is really encouraging. I was pleased with the time although I'd like to get to something like 3.08 or 3.09 if I do it again,\" <a href=\"http://www.thisisleicestershire.co.uk/Athletics-Leicester-City-star-Muzzy-Izzet-making-giant-strides-marathon-runner/story-12044298-detail/story.html\" title=\"\">he told the Leicester Mercury</a>. \"I've probably not done as much training as I thought I needed and I had a couple of weeks when I didn't do anything, so that wasn't ideal. But I was quite pleased with things. The last five or six miles were probably the hardest thing I've ever had to do.\"</p> <p>Hot on Izzet's heals in the 2011 London race was Dwight Yorke, who came home in <a href=\"http://results-2011.virginlondonmarathon.com/2011/index.php?content=detail&amp;fpid=search&amp;pid=search&amp;id=0000030F5ECC83000003AA94&amp;lang=EN&amp;event=MAS&amp;ageclass=\" title=\"\">3hr 31min 56sec</a> (<a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1378127/Hes-certainly-got-type-Dwight-Yorke-heads-home-night-post-marathon-TOWIEs-Chloe-Sims.html\" title=\"\">and still had the energy for a night on the tiles</a>).

One that turned up was <a href=\"http://www.bokia.se/mitt-italien-pasta-och-pizza-fran-norr-till-soder-4256276\" title=\"\">'Mitt Italien', by TV football pundit and former Atalanta midfielder Glenn Str\u00f6mberg</a>.</p> <p>\"It's a selection of pasta and pizza recipes organised by region, with brief interviews and tips from other Swedes who've played in Italy (Tomas Brolin, Kennet Andersson, Jesper Blomqvist, Sven etc). And it's actually rather good \u2013 the recipe for rigatoni with ragu bolognese is fantastic \u2013 though I don't imagine an English translation is available.\"</p> <p>Alas, we couldn't find one, but here's another for the Christmas list: Sebastian Csar emailed to let us know that the former Hertha Berlin captain Arne Friedrich, now playing for Chicago Fire, co-wrote the optimistically titled <a href=\"http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/3517069574\" title=\"\">\"Foodball: Cook like a world champion\"</a>. Set in soft focus photos of Friedrich chopping greens while the goateed celebrity chef Ralf Zacherl leans on a football close by, the foreword tells readers to \"Keep on rolling the football und keep on cooking!\"</p> <p>\"There is another bright example of a brilliant footballer writing about something completely different,\" writes Eberhard Spohd. \"Horst Hrubesch. The German international (21 caps, six goals), the three-times German champion, winner of the Champions Cup and the one to score both goals in the Euro final in 1980 against Belgium [are you chairman of the fan club, Eberhard?] is not only a horse breeder, he is also a great fisherman.</p> <p>\"His book <a href=\"http://img.zvab.com/member/12555d/37442322.jpg\" title=\"\">Dorschangeln vom Boot und an den K\u00fcsten [Cod fishing from a boat and the coast]</a>, which he wrote together with Dieter Schicker, also from 1980, is a classic. The book teaches the reader everything he has to know if he wants to catch cod (and its relatives of the family Gadidae) with a fishing rod.\" And having faithfully translated the link Eberhard sent in, we can tell you that Der Spiegel called it \"a classic in the fishing literature\", no less.</p> <p>\"Might I mention that famed Nobel-prize winning physicist, Niels Bohr, was a keen footballer and played in goal for his local Copenhagen team, Akademisk Boldclub.\" Yes, you might, Greg Jenner. \"His brother Harald, a noted mathematician, even represented Denmark as a footballing Olympian. Admittedly their books are not quite as readable as Carlos Puyol's culinary adventures, but they go some way to dispelling the myth that footballers are stupid.\"</p> <p>Indeed \u2013 unfortunately the Knowledge's usually excellent atomic physics is a little rusty, so no excerpts here. The same goes for The Road to Ithaca, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/feb/21/championsleague.barcelona\" title=\"\">a book by the former Barcelona defender Oleguer Presas</a>. Tipping us off, Eoghan Kenny calls it \"wide-ranging and rather high-brow for a footballer\"; Wikipedia has it down as a series of recollections from his younger days, but the reviews describe a cross between a football story and a political manifesto, which likens Barcelona's 2005 title-winning side to Catalan fighters in the Spanish Civil War. We think.</p> <p>It certainly beats Arild Stavrum's efforts for imagination. \"I doubt they have been translated in to English,\" says Jostein Nygard, \"even with the recent flood of Scandinavian crime novels to the British market.\" Stavrum left Molde having just turned 32, and a few years later published \"31 years on the Pitch\". Here's some of the blurb: \"Joachim learned to dribble at four years old. While growing up, he had three dreams: he wanted to be the top scorer in the Norwegian Premier League, a national team player and a pro. At 31, he has achieved his goals. He has lived well by playing football for many years, but he's getting to the end of his contract at Molde FK and fears that his career is nearing its end.\" Hmm.</p> <p>Thanks also to Alex Locatelli for pointing out the Fulham goalkeeper Mark Schwarzer's series of children's books, about young footballer Edward \"Megs\" Morrison's struggles to get a soccer team going after moving to Australia. \"Will the Vootball Kids band together in the face of adversity? Can Megs remain focused on football despite some spiky issues at home? And how will the Kids perform in their first season playing competitive football?\" We're hooked \u2013 which is more than can be said for our friend Eberhard Spohd, who only started reading about cod fishing after tiring of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.de/Alles-Ein-fiktiver-Tatsachenroman/dp/3923838506\" title=\"\">\"Everything: A fictional historical novel\",</a> by the former German goalkeeper Bodo Illgner. \"I couldn't read it long enough to find out what it's about,\" says Eberhard. \"Too many greasy soft-porn scenes make this book unreadable.\"</p> <p>If ever there was assurance of the merits of staying in one's comfort zone, however, it surely comes in the form of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Unforgettable-Fire-Story-Eamon-Dunphy/dp/0670821047\" title=\"\">\"Unforgettable Fire, the story of U2\"</a>: written by Eamon Dunphy, eviscerated by critics, and emailed to us by Dave Bruen. Dunphy, a former Millwall, Charlton and Republic of Ireland midfielder, had already written his Diary of a Professional Footballer when he was asked by U2's manager to write about the band's early years. Though plenty of U2 fans enjoyed it, the book was variously described as \"cloying and worshipful\" and \"full of breathtaking inaccuracies\".</p> <p>After publication, Dunphy criticised the way the band had treated him, the band said he had failed to let them see the manuscript and sort out the mistakes; Dunphy called Bono a \"pompous git\", Bono reportedly called Dunphy \"rat poison\". Either way, the book took a panning.</p> <p>\"The catalogue of errors piles up until it's impossible to see beyond it,\" wrote Neil McCormack, for Hot Press. \"If what I know first-hand is so inaccurately represented (and these are not all the errors of which I'm aware, not by a long shot), then I can have no faith in any of the rest of Dunphy's storytelling. There is simply nothing I can take at face value in this book.</p> <p>\"Dunphy's not only guilty of outrageous inaccuracy, he is also grossly ill-informed on the subject that should be at the story's core: music... I filled 18 pages of a small notebook with Dunphy's errors, misrepresentations, misunderstandings and misinformed comment.</p> <p>\"Sometimes, reading this book, I get the feeling somebody's been pulling Dunphy's leg.\"</p> <h2>DELIBERATE OWN GOALS</h2> <p><strong>\"I was wondering if an own goal has ever been intentionally conceded by a player in protest or out of anger at his own club/fans/manager?\" </strong>writes Thomas Houghton.</p> <p>This is one of those bits where we find a few stories that don't quite fulfil the criteria so as to avoid leaving a blank space. There was talk that William Gallas had managed to force a move from Chelsea to Arsenal by threatening to score own goals if they made him stay but, though recent performances suggest sabotage is not beyond him, Gallas always denied the accusation. In the 1950s, Brian Clough accused his Middlesbrough team-mates of deliberately conceding goals in order to fleece the bookmakers. That (and the fact that he kept scoring enough goals to even matches up) made him an unpopular man in the dressing room.</p> <p>There have been plenty of protest own goals scored \u2013 149 in one game, in fact, but the target of the players' ire was the referee. In 2002 AS Adema beat the reigning Madagascan champions Stade Olympique de L'Emyrne 149-0 after SOE's players spent the whole game putting the ball into their own net during the final game of a round-robin title play-off. In the preceding game, SOE had been put out of the running for the title when the referee awarded a dubious late penalty with which DSA Antananarivo equalised. The coach and four players received suspensions and stadium bans, which at least spared them the agita of fans who wanted their money back.</p> <h2>KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE</h2> <p><strong>\"Is Verein f\u00fcr Leibes\u00fcbungen Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach the longest team name in football?\" </strong>ask Robert Bashford and Justin Walker.</p> <p>Far from it chaps: Anglesey League team Clwb P\u00eal-droed Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch came pretty close to landing the prize with a weighty 70 letters, but Stuart Orford can do even better. \"My favourite is Dutch Eredivisie side NAC Breda,\" he begins somewhat unconvincingly. \"It expands to Nooit Opgeven Altijd Doorzetten Aangenaam Door Vermaak En Nuttig Door Ontspanning Combinatie Breda.\"</p> <p>\"I'd like to nominate my team, UCD, in the League of Ireland Premier Division,\" says Kevin Burke. \"Under some universities' act a few years ago, we officially became University College Dublin, National University of Ireland Dublin, Association Football Club (81 letters). There are some who'll suggest that, with that hideous new crest, it should now (unofficially) be University College Dublin Dublin, National University of Ireland Dublin, Association Football Club (87 letters). This would translate into Irish as Cumann Sacair Ollscoil na h\u00c9ireann Baile \u00c1tha Cliath Baile \u00c1tha Cliath, Ollscoil N\u00e1isi\u00fanta na h\u00c9ireann Baile \u00c1tha Cliath, which is 102 letters and a comma.\"</p> <p>Not bad, Kevin, but a rival school of learning trumps it. \"I think you'd have to go some to beat the full name in Thai of Bangkok University FC,\" claims Liam O'Brien. \"This would include the longest place name in the world, using the official Thai name for Bangkok. When translated into English, it would run to 189 characters as follows: Samosorn Maha Vittiyalai Krungthep Mahanakorn Boworn Rattanakosin Mahintara Yutthaya Mahadilok Phop Noparat Rajathani Burirom Udom Rajaniwet Mahasatharn Amorn Phimarn Avatarn Sathit Sakkatattiya Vishnukarm Prasit.\"</p> <p>But there's an even longer name in the very same city! That of Thai Pro League side Bangkok Bravo. \"Should they ever wish to refer to themselves by their full (English translated) name,\" notes Dale Farrington, \"they would be called: Krung Thep Mahanakhon Amon Rattanakosin Mahinthara Ayuthaya Mahadilok Phop Noppharat Ratchathani Burirom Udomratchaniwet Mahasathan Amon Piman Awatan Sathit Sakkathattiya Witsanukam Prasit Bravo Association Football Club (196 characters).
