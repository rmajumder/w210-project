  "<p>There was no answer even after the third ring but the canvassers did not budge from the door. There was a waft of cooking and muffled sound of children. \"Patience is a science, like baking,\" said Cheryl Lawrence, a pastry cook-turned political activist. \"Get it right and the cake doesn't collapse.\"</p> <p>Eventually the door opened. Zelalem Woldetadik, an Ethiopian-American identified as a likely Obama voter, said yes, she would vote for the president. \"And your husband, Dinkos?\" asked Lawrence, consulting her printed database. \"Him too,\" replied Woldetadik.</p> <p>Lawrence made sure the woman knew the polling centre location and left a clutch of leaflets. \"We'll be back here again until we know she's voted. Just to make sure.\"</p> <p>Barack Obama won Nevada by a whopping 12.5 points in 2008 but it has since endured one of the country's highest unemployment and foreclosure rates, giving Republicans a chance to wrest the state's six electoral college votes.</p> <p>Mitt Romney's strategy, backed by field offices and a Super PAC advertising blitz, is to mobilise rural and Mormon Republicans in huge numbers, sway a majority of voters in swing Washoe county and dent Obama's lead in populous Clark county, which includes Las Vegas.</p> <p>The Democrats and their union allies have responded by registering 90,000 more voters than Republicans, mostly in Clark county, and prodding them into early voting. They were boosted by a fast growing Latino population which shudders at Romney's stance on immigration.</p> <p>Their extensive ground game \u2013 reflected in the likes of Lawrence visiting and revisiting households until they vote \u2013 appears to be paying off. Democrats have a 48,000 lead in the 700,000 people who voted by last week.</p> <p>With only about 300,000 more votes expected to be cast (for a total of around 1m), Obama will probably win, reckoned Jon Ralston, the dean of Nevada political analysts and an electoral sage.</p> <p>\"[Republicans] need everything to break right \u2013 President Obama haemorrhages Democrats and independents vote in huge numbers for Romney, two things I do not see happening.\" No matter how good the Republican turnout on Tuesday, <a href=\"http://www.ralstonflash.com/blog/obama-will-win-state-heller-will-barely-squeak-horsford-takes-cd4-and-gop-will-take-state\" title=\"\">Obama will hold the state 50% to Romney's 46%</a>, Ralston predicted.</p> <p>Obama has visited Nevada 10 times this year, including a rally in Las Vegas last week. Romney has visited eight times since April, and his running mate Paul Ryan five times, including a visit to Reno on Monday.</p> <p>\"Nevada we are counting on you,\" Ryan told a cheering crowd inside an aviation hanger. \"We know you can do this. We can do this together. Lets run through the tape. Lets leave it all on the field.\"</p> <p>Romney also dispatched his Spanish-speaking son Craig to tour the state and woo Latino voters, hammering the message that the economy will recover faster under his father.</p> <p>Texas governor Rick Perry, who lost to Romney in the Republican primaries, campaigned for him in Las Vegas in recent days and insisted the GOP was on course for victory.</p> <p>\"Our voters historically vote on election day,\" he told reporters. \"<a href=\"http://politics.blogs.foxnews.com/2012/11/05/team-romney-battles-nevada-amid-obamas-advantage-numbers-early-voting\" title=\"\">Their voters vote during early periods</a>, so these early votes don't cause me great consternation.\"</p>",
  "<p>The importance of New Hampshire's four electoral college votes is illustrated by the fact that Mitt Romney was hosting his last big campaign event here on Monday night.</p> <p>He won the New Hampshire primary in January, kickstarting his bid for the Republican nomination, and the state's four electoral college votes could be crucial if he is to have any chance of getting past the crucial 270 mark and into the White House.</p> <p>Romney's event at the Verizon Wireless Arena in downtown Manchester, alongside Kid Rock, was billed as a \"Final Victory Rally\" with more than 11,000 people expected to attend \u2013 despite freezing temperatures in the state over the past few days.</p> <p>Romney, who will appear with Kid Rock on Monday, has strong ties to New Hampshire. He has a summer home by Lake Winnipesaukee in the Wolfeboro area of the state and has spoken about the summers spent playing the inter-family \"Romney Olympics\" there. (Participants are limited to Romney family members, events include volleyball and tennis.)</p> <p>He was also governor of neighbouring Massachusetts as recently as 2006, although polls last month showed him losing Massachusetts by more than 16 points.</p> <p>Obama has claims on New Hampshire, too, having won by 9.6 points in 2008. He was here on Sunday, joined by Bill Clinton for a rally in Concord when 14,000 people turned out at the Statehouse as Obama vowed to protect college grants and his healthcare act if re-elected. Clinton, ever popular among a Democratic crowd, spoke for about 25 minutes after being introduced by New Hampshire's governor John Lynch.</p> <p>\"He's bringing along a rock star,\" Lynch said of Romney's Monday night event. \"Would you rather see Kid Rock or the Comeback Kid?\" The reference to Clinton's self-appointed nickname during his 1992 primary was well appreciated by the crowd.</p> <p>The late appearances by both candidates can perhaps be attributed to the fact that New Hampshire has no early voting \u2013 except by absentee ballot \u2013 so the majority of votes in the state will be cast on Tuesday.</p> <p>Another factor is the tightness of the race which remains too close to call. The latest WMUR poll here showed a two-point lead for Obama that is within the margin of error.</p> <p>Like Obama, Romney was here over the weekend, holding a rally at Portsmouth international airport on Saturday morning. Romney criticised Obama for having not kept the promises of 2008 while saying he would better handle the economy.</p> <p>\"New Hampshire got me the Republican nomination, and New Hampshire is going to get me the White House,\" Romney told the thousand-strong crowd.</p> <p>Obama will hope his ground network of volunteers can keep Romney at bay. The Obama campaign will hold get out the vote efforts at several locations in Manchester on both Monday and Tuesday.</p> <p>Volunteers are being encouraged to sign up for three or four hour shifts of phonebanking local residents, at venues including Southern New Hampshire University and a Teamsters HQ.</p>",
  "<p>For Obama it all began in a cold and snowy Iowa in January 2008 when his audacious bid for the White House was first validated by victory over Hillary Clinton in the first of the Democratic primaries. Yesterday he came full circle, ending his 2012 campaign at a downtown rally in Des Moines in the company of his wife, Michelle, and Springsteen. It was a remarkable landmark moment: win or lose Obama will probably never hold another campaign rally of his own again, as American presidents are limited to just two terms.</p> <p>His victory against Clinton in 2008, which saw an overwhelmingly white rural midwestern state pick a black outsider over the candidate of the party establishment, eventually propelled Obama to be America's first African-American president. He also won the state in the 2008 presidential race, easily beating Senator John McCain by 53% to 44%.</p> <p>But things have not been so easy this time around in Iowa and almost no one expects a repeat of Obama's easy victory four years ago. In six polls in Iowa since the middle of October, Obama has led in four and Romney in two.</p> <p>That puts Iowa firmly among the swing states with both sides angling for a victory there. It may only have six electoral college votes but in a tight electoral contest, they could make all the difference between winning and losing.</p> <p>Indeed Romney's running mate, firebrand Wisconsin congressman Paul Ryan, also chose to spend part of the last day of his campaign in Des Moines, holding a rally in one of the city's suburbs.</p> <p>There are grounds for Romney's team to have some hope. The state's most influential newspaper, the Des Moines Register, endorsed Romney in a move that angered some of Obama's top aides. However, the paper also last weekend ran an editorial written by former president Clinton in which he urged Iowans to back Obama. \"I'm for Barack Obama because his policies will bring back middle-class jobs and incomes and help the poor,\" Clinton wrote.</p> <p>On election night, both campaigns in Iowa will be looking to extend their support bases into the other side's territory. For Obama, most votes lie in big cities such as Des Moines, Davenport and Cedar Rapids and small college towns, mostly in the east of the state. Romney and the Republicans look to rural areas, especially in western Iowa, and the state's powerful evangelical community. The few areas that are \"swing\" are smaller towns and the suburbs and exurbs of larger cities: as they are in most other states.</p>",
  "<p>\"There's not a food fight every time we sit at the dinner table, if that's what you mean,\" said Tom Butler as he stood outside the polling station in Columbus, Ohio. He'd just voted for Mitt Romney, and his wife, Jennifer, standing beside him, had just voted for Barack Obama.</p> <p>The Butlers sum up perfectly the great state of Ohio on the eve of the presidential election. The polls suggest that the roughly 8 million Ohioans who are registered to vote are fairly evenly split, though Tom Butler will not want to hear that his wife's political preference appears to have a razor-fine edge.</p> <p>Jennifer said she remained undecided until about three days ago. \"I've gone back and forth, back and forth. I've really had a hard time with this election.\"</p> <p>What swung it in the end for Obama, she said, was that she feared Romney's social policies, particularly his threat to nominate to the US supreme court justices who would overthrow Roe v Wade, the right to an abortion \u2013 a theme that has been laboured heavily in Democratic attack adverts in Ohio.</p> <p>Tom by contrast has been fairly steady for months in favour of Romney, mainly on economic grounds. \"We can all agree that Barack is a proponent of larger government and Mitt of smaller, and I happen to favour smaller,\" he said.</p> <p>Similar discussions and disagreements are playing out all across Ohio, albeit perhaps rarely under the same roof. In the final hours of campaigning the two candidates and their leading surrogates were continuing to pound all corners of the state in the hope of squeezing every last voter out of the system.</p> <p>The headline of the Columbus Dispatch captured the feeling in a state that for months now has been inundated with politicians and their TV ads making their case: \"The heart of it all,\" the paper said, pointing out that presidential candidates have visited this state 83 times this year, a record in modern history.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2012/11/04/dispatch-poll-shows-ohio-a-toss-up.html\">In its most recent poll</a>, the paper gives Obama the lead with 50% to 48% \u2013 though that is in the margin of error and a strong turnout for Romney could easily tip it the other way.</p> <p>Both Obama and Romney were making a last appearance in the state whose 18 electoral votes have been widely seen as being the decisive prize among all the battleground states. There is a great deal riding on the outcome here, particularly for Romney, whose electoral college numbers do not easily add up to the 270 needed to win without Ohio.</p> <p>Obama was going for a last stab at celebrity in the hope of charming supporters into working that little bit harder on election day. He brought with him to a rally in downtown Columbus the Boss himself, Bruce Springsteen, whose boy-from-the-backstreets sensibility has sure-fire appeal with Ohio's working-class white males. He also brought on stage with him Jay-Z, a nod perhaps to another crucial Ohio demographic \u2013 African American communities in the large cities.</p> <p>You can tell a lot about a presidential candidate by the musical company he keeps. At Romney's final rally in Ohio, also in Columbus, he was accompanied by the Marshall Tucker Band, a country rock outfit that would speak to the conservative rural heartlands of Ohio in the south and west.</p>",
  "<p>Up to 50,000 people began converging on an outdoor area in the college town of Madison on Monday morning for Obama's closing rally in the state with Springsteen, the crowning event of a last-minute blitz by the Obama camp designed to ensure Wisconsin stays solidly within the Democratic column.</p> <p>The state voted for Obama in double-digits last time around, but was more evenly divided in the closing days of this campaign. The Obama camp has gone all out to ensure Wisconsin does not slip away to Romney, with the president holding two big rallies here since Saturday \u2013 both times with a platinum-selling pop star in tow. Romney held his last rally on Friday.</p> <p>On Saturday, Katy Perry in a sequined dress reading: 'Forward\" told a crowd of thousands in Milwaukee there were no excuses for not making it to the polls. \"Well my grandmother is 91 and she got out to cast a ballot,\" she said.</p> <p>Both sides deployed their armies of volunteers to knock on doors and make phone calls \u2013 barring a pause of a few hours on Sunday when the campaigns shut down for the Green Bay Packers football game. \"Nobody is going to knock on a door while the game is on,\" said Tammy Baldwin, who is running a tough race for Senate.</p> <p>But Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin native, brought the campaign to the football field, visiting with supporters in Green Bay.</p> <p>For Obama's hard core of supporters, Tuesday's vote is even more crucial than it was four years ago. \"I think this is even more important,\" said Jared Steager, a hotel worker. \"Four years ago Republicans were not really as crazy as they are now. They are just too radical,\" he said.</p> <p>Barbara Overstreet, a real estate agent who has voted Republican in the past, said she was put off by the Republican-dominated Congress. \"All they want to do is get Obama out. They won't say yes to anything he does.\"</p> <p>Both sides claim their sides are fired up, but there is an element of exhaustion for many in Wisconsin. It has been in a state of political tumult for two years, after a newly elected conservative Republican governor tried to break local unions.</p> <p>The campaigns are also keeping an eye on the weather: the forecast on election day is for snow flurries.</p> <p>\"It's been politics here 24-7. I think everyone is ready to take a holiday,\" said Todd Hunter, a Romney supporter at a rally in the mid-sized town of Fond du Lac. \"But our side is more energised for sure.\"</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama and Mitt Romney's campaigns are setting the stage for legal battles in key swing states, particularly Florida and Ohio, if the election result is close enough to be challenged in court.</p> <p>Florida's Democratic party laid down a marker at the weekend with a lawsuit as electors once again grappled with long lines in parts of the state after officials circumvented new laws limiting early voting. The legal action, before any ballots have even been counted, accused the Republican-controlled state legislature of cutting short early voting, which has typically been used more by Democrats, in order to discourage opponents from casting ballots. The lawsuit is likely to form part of the basis of a court battle if the state proves decisive in putting Mitt Romney into the White House.</p> <p>Romney must win Florida to stand a chance of taking the presidency. Some polls put him neck and neck with Obama in the state, although others give the Republican the edge.</p> <p>If Romney takes Florida, the election is likely to be decided in Ohio, where the Republican secretary of state, Jon Husted, is facing accusations of attempting to manipulate the casting of provisional ballots, which tend to favour Democrats.</p> <p>Independent monitors also warn that Ohio's system for issuing absentee ballots is failing to find registered voters and wrongly telling people they are not entitled to cast a ballot.</p> <p>In Florida, some election administrators effectively extended early voting by other means in several places \u2013 including Miami, and Hillsborough County around Tampa \u2013 regarded as decisive in deciding who takes the state. They are permitting voters to pick up absentee ballots, fill them out on the spot and then deposit them.</p> <p>\"It's not early voting,\" said the Hillsborough county elections supervisor, Earl Lennard. \"But it is voting early.\"</p> <p>The Republican state governor, Rick Scott, has turned down appeals to extend early voting.</p> <p>A former Democratic governor of Florida, Charlie Crist, chided Scott. </p> <p>\"It seems suppressive not to do so,\" he said as he campaigned on behalf of Obama in Tampa. \"It's unconscionable to me that our governor would not sign an extension. This is a precious, sacred right that we have in our country. We're fortunate we get to choose our leaders. It seems to me that if you value that precious right you'd do everything to encourage people to vote. It seems suppressive not to do so. I just don't understand why someone would not extend it.\"</p> <p>Wendy Weiser, head of the democracy programme at the Brennan Centre for Justice, which joined legal battles against attempts in various states to impose voter identification laws and other election requirements, said that the long lines to vote in Florida are a product of Republican machinations.</p> <p>\"This is a clear legacy of the effort to restrict voting this year,\" she said.</p> <p>Weiser also warned that the \"huge problem\" of the absentee ballot system in Ohio could have an impact on the outcome of the election. About 1.3m ballots have been requested. She said there could be tens of thousands, possibly hundreds of thousands, of people wrongly told they cannot vote.</p> <p>\"That is a huge number of votes that will be affected,\" she said. \"We may see the fight over this election move to the courtroom.\"</p> <p>Weiser said there is also a problem with provision ballots in the state.</p> <p>Democrats accuse Husted, the Republican secretary of state in Ohio, of making an eleventh hour bid to tamper with provisional ballots which are recorded when there's a complication with an individual's vote such as an address that doesn't match the voter roll.</p> <p>More than 200,000 provisional ballots were cast in Ohio in 2008, most of them by Democratic voters who tend to be more transient and therefore get caught up in disputes over addresses.</p> <p>On Friday, Husted issued an executive order requiring voters to fill out key parts of the registration forms previously done by poll workers.</p> <p>\"This was a clear effort to increase the statistical likelihood of there being errors that would justify disenfranchisement of provisional ballot voters who tend to be Democratic,\" said Subodh Chandra, a lawyer with a homeless coalition in north-east Ohio who identified the governor's move and has challenged the forms with a lawsuit. \"It's yet another game he's playing to put impediments in the way of voters.\"</p> <p>The court will rule on the dispute before 16 November \u2013 10 days after election day when the provisional ballots will be counted.</p> <p>In another swing state, <a href=\"http://actnow.gop.com/uploads/IA_SOS_AB%20Issue.pdf\">Republicans have written to Matt Schultz</a>, Iowa's secretary of state, alleging \"what appears to be illegal activity involving Democratic and Obama campaign operatives\".</p> <p>\"According to reputable media reports, Democratic operatives allegedly encouraged elderly persons to fill out and falsely sign absentee ballot requests for other family members. Additionally, the same reports suggest that Democratic operatives themselves may have even falsely filled out and submitted absentee ballot requests without the permission of the Iowa voters on whose behalf the requests were submitted,\" the letter said.</p> <p>The Republicans said they \"understand that the Iowa Department of Criminal Investigations is investigating this matter\".</p>",
  "<p>Kevin Blair is the sort of voter Obama and Romney want most \u2013 an undecided in the swing state of Colorado. Trouble is he doesn't want either of them. \"It sucks that we're stuck with these two schmucks.\"</p> <p>Despite the candidates claiming to represent radically different visions for America, the 28-year-old international affairs student sees depressing similarities in their economic and foreign policies.</p> <p>\"Our drone strikes are killing civilians, it's appalling.\" Blair is leaning more towards Obama but is not sure he will have the stomach to vote for him.</p> <p>Such undecided voters are a small, dwindling band in Colorado but they are enough to drive a frantic last minute push by both campaigns. The state has just nine electoral college votes but is perhaps the most finely balanced of all the races, a statistical tie which both sides believe could be decided by just a few thousand votes.</p> <p>That's why Obama, Joe Biden, Romney and Paul Ryan have collectively made eight trips here in the past four days, holding rallies in different places to squeeze every last drop of support.</p> <p>The president made his last appearance here at Aurora on Sunday night, giving 20,000 supporters who braved plunging temperatures a similar version of the barnstorming speech he gave 35 miles away in Boulder on Thursday.</p> <p>Romney made his final appearance at the Comfort Dental Amphitheatre on Saturday, packing in 17,000 supporters, and left Ryan to shore things up with a raucous rally at Castle Rock on Sunday and a final event at Johnson's Corner on Monday.</p> <p>Colorado is a big square but most people live \"on the line\", a north to south strip of towns and cities in the middle sandwiched between mountain and desert, providing a relatively easy population corridor for the campaigns.</p> <p>The state is divided between liberal bastions like Boulder, a university town, and conservative citadels like Colorado Springs and Pueblo, rife with religious and military sentiment. The challenge for each campaign is to mobilise their bases in such towns and fight for the elusive swing and independent voters of the Denver suburbs.</p> <p>Obama won the state by nine points in 2008. Latest polls peg him and Romney within the margin of error. Of 1.6m early votes, 38,000 more Republicans than Democrats have cast ballots, evidence of a fired up Republican ground game. More than a quarter of those who already cast ballots were registered as independent. Another 1m are expected to vote by Tuesday.</p> <p>Obama's hopes rest on women and Latinos. Women are receptive to the so-called \"Bennet strategy\" \u2013 a focus on issues like abortion and contraception \u2013 which the Democrat Michael Bennet successfully used in a 2010 senate race.</p> <p>Obama is sweeping Latinos, a fifth of the population, after outspending Romney 2 to 1 in Spanish language advertising, hammering his rival over immigration and making time to call the popular Denver-based KBNO radio show, La Voz del Pueblo, to banter with the host, Fernando Sergio.</p> <p>Romney, way ahead with white voters, is counting on supporters' palpable enthusiasm, (even if it is more about banishing Obama than anointing Romney), the tendency of Latinos to not turn out in great numbers and a sophisticated data management programme to identify and prod \"soft\" Romney supporters to the polls. Analysts disagree over which candidate may benefit more from a ballot on legalising cannabis, and the quixotic presidential candidacy of libertarian Gary Johnson.</p> <p>Linda Killian, author of The swing vote: the untapped power of independents, said higher turnout among independents would favour the incumbent. \"The issue in Colorado is not whether they'll vote for Mitt Romney, it's whether they'll vote. Because if they do, they'll vote for Obama.\" She could have been talking about Kevin Blair.</p>",
  "<p>The ground is already being laid for another huge legal battle over the election in Florida if the largest of the swing states proves decisive in choosing who wins. Polls generally give Romney the edge in Florida but surveys are conflicting and both parties say turnout will decide the result.</p> <p>Judging by the past week of early voting, supporters of the two candidates appear to be fired up, although without much of the optimism that drove Obama's 2008 campaign.</p> <p>About 4.4 million Floridians \u2013 more than one third of registered voters in the state \u2013 cast their ballots early, a substantial increase on four years ago. But long queues, with some people waiting more than seven hours to vote, and the curtailing of early voting by the Republican-controlled state legislature in circumstances that appear to make it more difficult to cast ballots in areas where the Democrats are strong, have already prompted a lawsuit.</p> <p>The Florida Democratic party's legal action is unlikely to go anywhere in the hours before the election but it is a marker that the result will be open to dispute if a Romney victory in Florida delivers him into the White House.</p> <p>The allegation that the Republicans are effectively trying to disenfranchise opponents is helping to drive some Democrats to the polls. \"The Republicans think we are stupid,\" said Lucia Wilson waiting to vote in Tampa on the last day of early voting on Saturday. \"They think we can't see what's happening before our eyes. They don't want Democrats to vote. They don't want black people to vote. They're doing everything they can to hand it to Romney. That's why I'm here for early voting. So I can be sure to vote.\"</p> <p>Turnout has also been bolstered by a stream of political heavyweights descending on the state to urge people to vote. None is bigger than Bill Clinton. \"We love Clinton. He's fabulous,\" said Michelle Butler, a business manager, waiting to see him speak. \"Now he's out of office, he can say things the president can't say like Romney's full of shit. Obama has to keep up the political integrity of the office. Clinton can go out there and call Romney on all his crap.\"</p> <p>Across the street, a Romney supporter held a one word sign: \"Obamanation\". \"These people made a huge mistake in electing him,\" said a man who would only give his name as Jerry. \"They should admit their mistake and put a real American in the White House.\"</p> <p>A real American?</p> <p>\"Someone who puts America first. Not someone who's trying to destroy America.\" Jerry declined to elaborate.</p> <p>But for some Obama supporters, it is a largely unknown Romney that is driving them to the polls.</p> <p>\"Fear is not too strong a word,\" said Claire Fitzgerald, a store manager in line to vote. \"It's not what Romney has said he will do that worries me. It's that he's shifted positions so often he could do anything. We don't really know what he stands for. Who's he listening to? Maybe the wrong people who will take us into another war. Plus, he wants to kill Obamacare [health care reforms]. That's reason enough to vote against him.\"</p>",
  "<p>The most political exhibition in the most political city in America currently occupies the circular galleries of <a href=\"http://www.hirshhorn.si.edu/collection/home/\" title=\"\">the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington DC</a>. As the US has been preparing to vote, the Hirshhorn has been showing work by Chinese artist and agitator Ai Weiwei, an exhibition that includes a load of rusty metal poles laid out on the floor, like a strange, monotonous rolling plain.</p> <p>These identical spindly struts come from schools that collapsed in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/china-earthquake\" title=\"\">2008 Sichuan earthquake</a>. Ai Weiwei believes the deaths of thousands of children were caused by low-quality school buildings. On a gallery wall, he lists the&#xa0;names of the children who died.</p> <p>If you think this is a bit tangential to&#xa0;the US election, you have not been following its bitter rhetoric. In every TV debate between Republican candidate Mitt Romney and Democrat Barack Obama, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/22/final-debate-obama-romney-live\" title=\"\">the economic power of China has been an obsessive issue</a>. Television campaigns have harped on about the wickedness of the country: one, which is not officially acknowledged by either candidate, even portrays a secret meeting in China where sinister party cadres laugh at those American fools; <a href=\"http://www.artcritical.com/appel/images/mao.jpg\" title=\"\">Andy Warhol's portrait of Mao hangs in their villainous bunker</a>. Meanwhile, the Romney campaign, seeking to sow doubts among voters who credit Obama with bailing out the US auto industry, claims Chrysler now plans to outsource jobs to China. <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/30/us-chrysler-jeep-idUSBRE89T15X20121030\" title=\"\">Chrysler vociferously denies this.</a></p> <p>Ai Weiwei's exhibition, no doubt accidentally, fits with this ramping up of anti-China sentiment. He believes in freedom. He believes in the individual. Indeed, you could almost say Ai Weiwei is more American \u2013 and more anti-China \u2013 in his politics than any of today's American artists. The ideals that he insists are universal are very much those of the country that still proudly calls itself the leader of the free world. So does this mean Ai Weiwei is in Romney's camp? Well, if that was true, he'd be just about the only major artist who was.</p> <p>A short distance from the Hirshhorn, walking through autumn leaves, I come&#xa0;to the soaring obelisk that is the Washington Monument. Not only is this dedicated to freedom but it is also, like Ai Weiwei's art, a minimalist masterpiece, despite being completed in the 19th century. Pure classical lines, no decoration, a towering truth: this is the focal point of a vast democracy that will tonight choose its leader. I can see, too, the Lincoln Memorial, where Martin Luther King made his famous \"I&#xa0;have a dream\" speech. And, hidden in the trees around the White House, I can make out firetrucks awaiting the presidential helicopter.</p> <p>American democracy is expressed in the neoclassical layout of Washington DC and its marble monuments. But what of the country's artists? Do they have any political vision to offer in 2012? Four years&#xa0;ago, US art was galvanised by Obama. He got their&#xa0;backing, financially and vocally; he also inspired them. Shepard Fairey's poster, showing the Democrat candidate's face and (in its most effective version) the word HOPE, captured the exhilaration of reborn liberal America. It is, arguably, the most recognisable image created by a US artist this century.</p> <p>But Obama has not inspired any comparable mood in the 2012 election. Back then, he was a blank slate; now he is an embattled figure whose first term can, by any standards, only be called a partial success. This does not mean he has no support in the art world \u2013 far from it. To look on the great works of modern American art in Washington's National Gallery is to see a veritable Olympus of Obama supporters.</p> <p>In its cool modern wing, I come face to face with the kind of ordinary, middle-class American both candidates are desperate to woo. Her name is Fanny and her face is 2.5m tall. <a href=\"http://www.nga.gov/education/classroom/elements/texture/close.shtm\" title=\"\">Chuck Close painted this portrait with his fingers in 1985.</a> <a href=\"http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/10/chuck-close-makes-art-in-fund-raising-gambit-for-obama/)\" title=\"\">A supporter of Obama</a>, Close serves on the president's Committee for the Arts and Humanities, and his portrait of his late mother-in-law is an icon of US democracy, with a twist. The enlarged scale makes the face an emphatic celebration of individualism, but there's a warmth and tenderness to the work, too, a feeling of caring in no small way derived from Close's painstaking method of using a tiny-scale grid to help him build up his minute fingermarks. It gives this ordinary citizen an air of vulnerability, one that can be read across the country as a whole.</p> <p>If Americans are scared of China, it is because they are afflicted by a sense of national decline. The Republican response, articulated by Romney, is to&#xa0;reassert the \"can do\" spirit of free market America, while also promising to abolish such leftie notions as Obama's work in social health provision. <a href=\"http://2012.republican-candidates.org/Romney/Issues.php\" title=\"\">This, he says, is the American way</a>. But is that the true American character? The country's art suggests otherwise, and not just in the portraiture of Close, with its grand sense of human frailty and the implication that we must care for one another.</p> <p>Sculptor Richard Serra is another artist said to be in the Obama camp, along with the subversive self-portraitist Cindy Sherman, the visionary abstract painter Brice Marden, the performance artist Laurie Anderson, and the architect Frank Gehry \u2013 a gallery of living greats. <a href=\"http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Obama-wins-the-art-worlds-support/26590\" title=\"\">As a headline in the Art Newspaper put it this summer: \"Obama wins the art world's support.\"</a> Of course, these are not the sort of celebrities politicians usually crave: <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-politics/9649201/US-election-Barack-Obama-is-winning-over-female-voters-with-Beyonce-and-Lena-Dunham.html\" title=\"\">Beyonc\u00e9's endorsement of Obama</a> is worth more. In fact, American art, despite being at the forefront of the avant garde in the 20th century, currently has few household names. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/culture-cuts-blog/2011/may/16/art-emin\" title=\"\">Tracey Emin's vote makes the news in Britain</a> \u2013 but mention <a href=\"http://www.hauserwirth.com/artists/20/paul-mccarthy/biography/\" title=\"\">leading US artist Paul McCarthy</a> in Los Angeles, where he lives, and people will think you mean Paul McCartney.

The massive, dangerous-looking steel plates, balanced precariously against each other, evoke America's troubled industries; Serra uses steel mills to make his sculpture. Rust in colour and blue collar in status, this mighty sculpture suggests not the power and glory of the Republican individual making millions and bestriding the world, but the dwarfing of people by mighty machines and great cities. Running counter to the Republicans' notion of a chosen land whose people don't need a supportive state (just low taxes and free markets), Serra's work shows us the America its great artists have seen:&#xa0;a place of sorrow, suffering and&#xa0;vulnerability, chronicled with compassion. A more human America.</p> <p>Even the dead guys seem to be voting Democrat. <a href=\"http://www.nga.gov/fcgi-bin/timage_f?object=55819&amp;image=13750&amp;c=20centpa\" title=\"\">Jackson Pollock's 1950 masterpiece Lavender Mist</a> keeps me coming back to the National Gallery. The skeins, strata, loops and scars on this beautiful web of colour speak of American freedom \u2013 but it is a tragic freedom, the freedom of the blues and jazz that Pollock played as he painted. Within months of creating this lovely riff of a painting, this troubled man would surrender to his old demon, booze, and in a few years he was dead in a drunken car crash. No one was more in need of help than this great American artist \u2013 and as a young man, he got it, <a href=\"http://www.nga.gov/feature/pollock/\" title=\"\">helped by the art programme of the 1930s New Deal</a>.</p> <p>Half a century before Pollock painted the blues, the sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens made a cast of his Shaw Memorial, portraying <a href=\"http://www.nga.gov/feature/shaw/home.shtm\" title=\"\">the Massachussetts 54th Regiment going off to die for freedom</a>. His tribute to this African-American soldiers, who fought for <a href=\"http://www.nga.gov/feature/shaw/s3000.shtm\" title=\"\">the anti-slavery cause in the civil war</a>, now sits in the National Gallery. African-American faces from a divided past bear witness to the fact that US history bears little resemblance to the Tea Party version promoted by the US right today \u2013 in which the entire American story is boiled down to (white) people versus big government. If Romney loses the vote, it will probably be put&#xa0;down to \"racial demography\" \u2013 as&#xa0;every non-white American votes for&#xa0;Obama.</p> <p>On the Shaw Memorial, you see the soldiers marching steadily towards an unknown future. It's a work that could be summed up in a single word: hope. If American art has a common theme, it is this deeply progressive impulse. It&#xa0;is why American artists, living and dead, vote Obama.</p>",
  "<p>You might be fooled into thinking that election day only features the presidential race. Nothing could be further from the truth. Americans will be voting on a whole host of local and statewide elections that will have a great effect both on their local communities and the national landscape.</p> <p>I'm not going to try to cover the House of Representatives: if you're interested in coverage of those, you can check the <a href=\"http://cookpolitical.com/\">Cook Political</a> or <a href=\"http://rothenbergpoliticalreport.com/\">Rothenberg Political</a> report. My own estimation, as it has been throughout this entire campaign, is that the Republicans will retain control of the House with room to spare.</p> <p>I will, however, run down some Senate races here. At the beginning of the year, Republicans looked primed to take the four seats necessary to win an outright majority in the United States Senate. That's when moderate Republican Olympia Snowe of Maine decided to retire, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/05/angus-king_n_2075691.html?utm_hp_ref=elections-2012\">leaving the seat open</a> for Democratic-leaning Independent former Governor Angus King. It's been all downhill since then for Republicans: poor Republican candidates who have made gaffe after gaffe, and good Democratic ones have left the GOP Senate effort staggering.</p> <p>Republicans and Democrats look to split fairly equally the ten Senate seats discussed in detail in this article. All told, it looks like Democrats will maintain control of the Senate with 53 seats +/-2 (out of 100).</p> <p>To get more of an idea of how the Senate races will breakdown, including what times polls close, the polling averages and key swing counties, see below. I start with the earliest poll closing times. Keep in mind that swing counties are more difficult to pinpoint in Senate than presidential races, since swings can change from midterm (when these seats were last up for election) to presidential year and depending on whether an incumbent is running or not.</p> <p><strong>Group 1: poll closing at 7pm ET (Indiana's eastern counties close at 6pm ET)</strong></p> <h2>Indiana (incumbent Republican Richard Lugar defeated in primary)</h2> <p><em>HuffPollster aggregate:</em> Joe Donnelly (Democrat) +3.7 points</p> <p><em>Swing counties with 50k+ population (in every case, percentage points more Democratic than state in 2008 presidential election):</em> Allen (-5.4), Madison (+5.6), Vanderburgh (+1.5)</p> <p><strong>Strongholds</strong></p> <p><em>Democrats:</em> Lake County on the Northwest Illinois Border, Marion Country (Indianapolis) in the center of the state, Monroe County (Bloomington home to Indiana University) in the southwest</p> <p><em>Republicans:</em> Indianapolis suburbs such as Hamilton, Hendricks, and Johnson County, rural areas that dominate the state outside the major population centers, and the South Bend (home to Notre Dame) suburb of Elkhart County</p> <p><strong>Background</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398884345\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/5/1352152746697/mourdockt.jpg\" alt=\"richard mourdock\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Richard Mourdock (R-IN) Photograph: richardmourdock.com</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Republicans had this seat locked with long-time GOP Senator Richard Lugar.

He won the governor's mansion in 2005 on the strength of the new population growth in the north. He recently served as head of the Democratic National Committee.</p> <p>This race is very tight and either candidate could win. Kaine seems to be running a little ahead of Obama in the state. Still, there aren't many split tickets to be had in the Old Dominion. I would think whichever party wins the presidential election here is likely to win the Senate election as well.</p> <p><strong>Group 2: poll closing at 8pm ET</strong></p> <h2>Connecticut (independent Democratic incumbent Joseph Lieberman retiring)</h2> <p><em>HuffPollster aggregate:</em> Chris Murphy (Democrat) +6.2pt</p> <p><em>Swing counties with 50k+ population:</em> Middlesex, (+0.6), New London (-1.6), Windham (+0.6)</p> <p><strong>Strongholds</strong></p> <p><em>Democrats:</em> they do well in all the cities that dot the landscape, such as Bridgeport in Fairfield County.

McMahon is conservative on fiscal issues and a moderate on social issues (ie she's pro-choice and has an unclear position on gay rights).</p> <p>Murphy is currently a congressman from Connecticut's 5th district. In comparison to McMahon's unique background, he's a relatively boring politician. Murphy's a lawyer who's both socially and fiscally liberal. You might say he is the type of candidate you'd expect to win in a blue state such as Connecticut.</p> <p>McMahon was able to keep this race close through advertising. She hit the relatively unknown Murphy on past financial problems and a poor congressional attendance record. But like her race against the better known, current Senator Dick Blumenthal in 2010, McMahon looks to fall victim to Connecticut's blue tint. Obama won't win the state in a blowout, yet it should be enough to carry Murphy across the finish line.</p> <h2>Massachusetts (Republican incumbent Scott Brown running for re-election)</h2> <p><em>HuffPollster aggregate:</em> Elizabeth Warren (Democrat) +4.5pt</p> <p><em>Swing counties with 50k+ population:</em> Bristol (-2.6), Hampden (-0.5), Middlesex, (+4.3)</p> <p><strong>Strongholds</strong></p> <p><em>Democrats:</em> Berkshire, Franklin and Hampshire County in the west, along with Suffolk (Boston) in the east </p> <p><em>Republicans:</em> Barnstable and Plymouth in the south-east, along with Worcester in the center of the state</p> <p><strong>Background</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398884348\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/5/1352154090928/Elizabeth-Warren.jpg\" alt=\"elizabeth warren\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) Photograph: elizabethwarren.com</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I'm not sure there has been a more fascinating race to watch unfold than this highly-financed affair.

Brown did so by combining a favorable national environment with moderate positions and seriously impressive retail campaign skills</p> <p>Democrat Liz Warren isn't exactly a moderate: she's an old-school liberal who isn't afraid to voice her position on the need for the rich to pay a fairer share of taxes. Warren's bid to become director of the Consumer Protection Bureau <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/blog/160900/house-gop-escalates-attack-elizabeth-warren-consumer-bureau\">failed when Republicans stalled her nomination</a>. Republicans may very well regret helping redirect this Harvard law professor's energies to winning one of their Senate seats.</p> <p>Brown and Warren bounced back and forth in the polls all year. Brown took a lead late in the summer because of questions surrounding Warren's American Indian background and how it impacted her being hired at Harvard. Warren regained the edge after being featured at the Democratic National Convention. She's held onto the lead in most polls, and is now the favorite.</p> <h2>Missouri (Democratic incumbent Claire McCaskill running for re-election)</h2> <p><em>HuffPollster aggregate:</em> Claire McCaskill +7.5pt</p> <p><em>Swing counties with 50k+ population:</em> Clay (-0.5), Jefferson (+2.7)</p> <p><strong>Strongholds</strong></p> <p><em>Democrats:</em> Boone County (home to the University of Missouri in the center), Jackson (Kansas City) in the west and St Louis City and County in the east </p> <p><em>Republicans:</em> pretty much everywhere else, including Greene (Springfield) and the St Louis suburb of St Charles County</p> <p><strong>Background</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398884349\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/5/1352154282707/Todd_Akin.jpg\" alt=\"todd akin\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Todd Akin (R-MO) Photograph: Wikipedia</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This was a gimme for the Republicans.

She also faced an electorate that has become increasing Republican over the years. McCaskill's approvals had been in the toilet, and then she saw her opening.</p> <p>Republicans had a competitive primary, and the Democrat McCaskill decided to spend money pumping up Republican Congressman Todd Akin. It worked, spectacularly.</p> <p>Akin won the primary and immediately repaid the favor: in a television interview, Akin spoke of \"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/aug/20/todd-akin-legitimate-rape-romney\">legitimate rape</a>\" and about the ability of the body to prevent pregnancy from rape. That turned a small Akin lead in the polls into a McCaskill edge.</p> <p>Akin refused to step down despite pleas from national Republicans.

That hasn't been enough. McCaskill has held onto the lead and looks set to win. The only question is whether Mitt Romney's strong standing in the state can bring disaffected Republicans currently voting for Libertarian Senate nominee Jonathan Dine back to the Akin clan.</p> <p><strong>Group 3: poll closing at 9pm ET</strong></p> <h2>Arizona (Republican incumbent Jon Kyl retiring)</h2> <p><em>HuffPollster aggregate:</em> Jeff Flake (Republican) +3.8pt</p> <p><em>Swing counties with 50k+ population:</em> Maricopa (-1.9), Pinal (-5.8)</p> <p><strong>Strongholds</strong></p> <p><em>Democrats:</em> Pima (Tuscon) in the south, in the American Indian regions of Coconino (Flagstaff) in the north and Apache in the north-east</p> <p><em>Republicans:</em> Mohave in the north-west and Yavapai in the center</p> <p><strong>Background</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398884350\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/5/1352154480676/carmona.jpg\" alt=\"richard carmona\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Richard Carmona (D-AZ) Photograph: carmonaforarizona.com</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There's no better example of a race that has flown underneath the radar than this one.

Democrats have argued that the growing Latino population, along with a high American Indian presence, would put this state in play. It hasn't on the presidential level, but it <em>has</em> for the Senate.</p> <p>Fiscal libertarian Republican Jeff Flake had held a small lead in the polls for most of the year. He's also a Mormon in a state with a good-sized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints population. Democrat Richard Carmona brandishes bipartisan bonafides for <a href=\"http://www.surgeongeneral.gov/about/previous/biocarmona.html\">having served as surgeon general under President George W Bush</a>; he had actually been recruited to run as a Republican by some party leaders in Arizona. Painting Flake as an extremist, Carmona has turned his small deficit in the polls into a tie, or even slight edge.</p> <p>Flake, aided by National Republicans, fired back. They pointed to Carmona's past unflattering interactions with female co-workers, including an ad in which one former colleague called him \"scary\". Carmona didn't help himself when he referred to a male debate moderator as \"<a href=\"http://dailycaller.com/2012/10/19/carmona-calls-male-debate-moderator-prettier-than-candy-crowley/\">prettier</a>\" than CNN's Candy Crowley.</p> <p>Flake has regained his edge, and will likely hold onto this Republican seat. </p> <h2>Wisconsin (Democratic incumbent Herb Kohl retiring)</h2> <p><em>HuffPollster aggregate:</em> Tammy Baldwin (Democrat) +0.7pt</p> <p><em>Swing counties with 50k+ population:</em> Kenosha (+4.2), Outagamie (-2.3), Racine (-6.7), Winnebago (-2.3)</p> <p><strong>Strongholds</strong></p> <p><em>Democrats:</em> Dane (Madison and the University of Wisconsin) in the south-central, La Crosse in the west and Milwaukee in the south-east</p> <p><em>Republicans:</em> Ozaukee, Walworth, Washington and Waukesha in the south-eastern Milwaukee suburbs</p> <p><strong>Background</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398884351\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/5/1352154650005/tammybaldwin.jpg\" alt=\"tammy baldwin\" width=\"140\" height=\"140\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) Photograph: Wikipedia</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Public domain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The LGBT community is likely to have a historic evening on Tuesday, and aside from marriage equality ballot measures elsewhere, one of their victories might be in the Badger State.

Democratic incumbent Jon Tester and Congressman at-large Denny Rehberg (meaning he represents the entire state in the House of Representatives) have been locked in a tight contest since the beginning of the year.</p> <p>Tester won during the Democratic wave of 2006, thanks to a localized campaign that can only be described as brilliant. His flat-top haircut and farming background made voters feel like he was one of the boys, even though his political stances are slightly more liberal than the state's bent.</p> <p>Rehberg has taken pains to appear as a moderate voice in a state that may not be liberal, but isn't all that conservative either. Rehberg won't be out-done, either, on being a native Montanan. While Tester is a third-generation farmer, Rehberg is a fifth-generation rancher. Rehberg has had some issues <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/on-congress/2012/10/report-on-rehberg-boat-crash-released-147927.html\">involving statements</a> made to a court regarding the role alcohol played when a friend crashed a boat in 2009.</p> <p>Tester looks to have neutralized any advantage Rehberg might have had because of Romney's expected strong showing in the state.

Pointing to her North Dakota roots and playing on the fact that North Dakota is actually a fairly moderate state in non-presidential politics, Heitkamp has turned an expected easy Republican victory into a heart-stopper.</p> <p>Republican at-large Congressman Rick Berg isn't a disaster of a candidate. He just isn't a very good one. While Heitkamp has tried her best to localize the race and focus on issues such as farming in a state that has many agrarians, Berg has tried to nationalize the race: Super Pacs have spent millions tying Heitkamp to national Democratic positions \u2013 and that seems to have had some effect.</p> <p>Berg has open the smallest of leads in this open Senate race, according to insider information. If that's right, it just goes to show that the fundamentals do matter.

Heller is neither a well-known brand nor a political titan. He benefits from having done little to offend and from fitting in well enough with the state's middle-of-the-road political profile. Put another way, Heller hasn't done anything to make the normal swing voter want to throw him out of office.</p> <p>Democratic Congresswoman Shelley Berkley is also moderate, but does not have the benefit of a squeaky clean profile. She's been <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/07/09/politics/house-ethics-berkley/index.html\">subject to attacks</a> over whether she used her leverage in the House of Representatives to keep her husband's kidney transplant center open, despite Medicare officials wanting to shut it down.</p> <p>Heller would likely win this race if everything else were equal. The issue is that Berkley is going to benefit from strong Democratic turnout backing President Obama in Berkley's Las Vegas congressional district. Berkley will also be helped out by Democratic Senate majority leader Harry Reid's \"get out the vote\" machine, which helped him defy the pre-election polls in the 2010 midterms. Heller will be relying on a good rural turnout, including a large Mormon vote coming out to support Mitt Romney.</p> <p>Either candidate could win, but polls show a slight lean towards Heller.</p>",
  "<p><strong> </strong></p> <p>\"There's not a food fight every time we sit at the dinner table, if that's what you mean,\" said Tom Butler at the polling station in Columbus. He'd just voted for Mitt Romney, and his wife, Jennifer, had just voted for Barack Obama.</p> <p>The Butlers sum up perfectly the state of the great state of Ohioon the eve of the election. The polls suggest the roughly 8 million Ohioans who are registered to vote are fairly evenly split, though Tom Butler will not want to hear that his wife's political preference appears to have a razor-fine edge. Jennifer was undecided until about three days ago. \"I've gone back and forth, back and forth \u2013 I've really had a hard time with this election.\"</p> <p>What swung it in the end for Obama, she said, was she feared Romney's social policies, particularly his threat to nominate to the US supreme court justices who would overthrow Roe versus Wade, the right to an abortion \u2013 a theme that has been laboured heavily in Democratic attack adverts in Ohio.</p> <p>Tom by contrast has been fairly steady for months in favour of Romney, mainly on economic grounds. \"We can all agree that Barack is a proponent of larger government and Mitt of smaller, and I happen to favour smaller,\" he said.</p> <p>Similar discussions and disagreements are playing out all across Ohio, albeit perhaps rarely over the same dinner table. In the final hours of campaigning the two candidates and their leading surrogates were continuing to pound all corners of the state in the hope of squeezing every last voter out of the system.</p> <p>The headline of the Columbus Dispatch captured the feeling in a state that for months now has been inundated with politicians and their TV ads pounding their case. \"The heart of it all,\" the paper said, pointing out that presidential candidates have visited this state 83 times this year, a record in modern history.</p> <p>In its most recent poll, <a href=\"http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2012/11/04/dispatch-poll-shows-ohio-a-toss-up.html\" title=\"\">the paper gives Obama the lead</a> 50% to 48% \u2013 though that is in the margin of error and a strong turnout for Romney could easily tip it the other way.</p> <p>Both Obama and Romney were making a last appearance in the state whose 18 electoral votes have been widely seen this year as being the decisive prize among all the battleground states. There is a great dealing riding on the outcome here, particularly for Romney, whose electoral college numbers do not easily add up to the 270 needed to win without Ohio.</p> <p>Obama was going for a last stab at celebrity on Monday in the hope of charming supporters into working that little bit harder on election day. He brought bringing with him to a rally in downtown Columbus the Boss himself, Bruce Springsteen, whose boy from the back streets sensibility appeals to Ohio's working-class white males.</p> <p>He also brought with him Jay-Z, a nod perhaps to another crucial Ohio demographic \u2013 African American communities in the large cities.</p> <p>You can tell a lot about a presidential candidate by the musical company he keeps. At Romney's final rally in Ohio, also in Columbus, he was accompanied by the Marshall Tucker Band, a country rock outfit that would speak to the conservative rural heartlands of Ohio in the south and west.</p>",

  "<p>This has been a great year for women in power in Africa with the election of a second female president, the appointment of the first female head of the African Union and not one, but two female Nobel prizewinners.</p> <p>In April we saw the election of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joyce_Banda\" title=\"\">Joyce Banda</a> as president of Malawi; in June, Gambia's <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2012/jun/14/fatou-bensouda-international-criminal-court\" title=\"\">Fatou Bensouda</a> was declared chief prosecutor of the international criminal court and in July <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-18846210\" title=\"\">Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma </a>became the first female head of the African Union. This trio join Liberian president and Nobel prizewinner <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/global-development/video/2012/nov/02/liberia-johnson-sirleaf-women-politics-video\">Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf</a> (video), Nigerian finance minister Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Head of Africa at the World Economic Forum Elsie Kanza and founder of the Ethiopian commodity exchange <a href=\"http://www.ted.com/speakers/eleni_gabre_madhin.html\" title=\"\">Eleni Gabre Madhin</a> in the <a href=\"http://www.ariselive.com/articles/arise-100-dynamic-women/128508/\" title=\"\">ARISE100</a> list of women shaping modern Africa launched in the US and worldwide this week. The magazine created the list to reflect the changes in relatively young states in Africa, where 16 countries have more female parliamentarians than the UK.</p> <p>The Rwandan parliament is made up of 56% women, while in the UK parliament women are languishing at a measly 22%. Rwanda is not a one off, in fact 16 African countries including South African (42%), Mozambique (39%) and Angola (38%) have a higher proportion of women in parliament than the UK.</p> <p>It remains to be seen whether the increasing visibility of African women in power translates to better prospects for women on the continent. \"The fact that we've now had three female heads of state shows that we are making progress,\" says Hadeel Ibrahim, executive director of the Mo Ibrahim foundation, whose annual Index charts good governance within Africa. \"If you look at our index, the area in which the most progress has been made is gender, but there's still clearly a long way to go,\" says Ibrahim. Lack of equality of opportunity \u2013 be it education or employment, poor maternal health, particularly in rural areas, and the fact that rape is being increasingly used as a weapon in conflict are just some of the frontline gender issues on the continent. For all the gains, women lead only two out of 54 African countries.</p> <p>It is too soon to say what difference their presence makes. A recent Gallup poll found that Rwandan women feel safer walking alone at night than UK women, for example, but in South Africa, where representation is also more equally split than in the UK, rape statistics are still shockingly high.</p> <p>More women in positions of power may lead to these issues being pushed higher up the political agenda, but for these conversations to be meaningful they must also include men. \"One of my frustrations in talking about gender on the continent is that it's always women talking about women; there aren't enough conversations about men, because in the end, women aren't beating themselves, they're not raping themselves, and we're not going to deal with these inequalities unless we understand what is frustrating and holding back our young men,\" says Ibrahim. There may be much more work to be done, but there are also many signs that the west should reconsider its image of what African power looks like.</p> <p><em>Hannah Pool is associate editor of Arise magazine</em></p>",
  "<p>Here's a remarkable thing. Neither Mitt Romney nor Barack Obama \u2013 with the exception of one throwaway line each \u2013 have mentioned climate change in the wake of hurricane Sandy.</p> <p>They are struck dumb. During a Romney rally in Virginia on Thursday, a protester held up a banner and shouted \"What about climate? That's what caused this monster storm\". The candidate stood grinning and nodding as the crowd drowned out the heckler by chanting \"USA! USA!\". Romney paused, then resumed his speech as if nothing had happened. The poster the man held up? It said \"End climate silence\".</p> <p>While other Democrats expound the urgent need to act, the man they support will not take up the call. Barack Obama, responding to his endorsement by the mayor of New York, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/01/bloomberg-endorses-obama-climate-change\" title=\"\">mentioned climate change last week</a> as \"a threat to our children's future\". Otherwise, I have been able to find nothing; nor have the many people I have asked on Twitter. Something has gone horribly wrong.</p> <p>There are several ways in which the impact of hurricane Sandy is likely to have been exacerbated by climate breakdown. Warmer oceans make hurricanes more likely and more severe. A warmer atmosphere holds more moisture, increasing the maximum rainfall. Higher sea levels aggravate storm surges. Sandy might not have hit the United States at all, had it not been for a blocking ridge of high pressure over Greenland, which diverted the storm westwards. The blocking high \u2013 rare there at this time of year \u2013 could be the result of the record ice melt in the Arctic this autumn.</p> <p>This might sound like the wisdom of hindsight. But in February the journal <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v2/n6/abs/nclimate1389.html\" title=\"\">Nature Climate Change</a> published an article warning that global warming is likely to \"increase the surge risk for New York City\". As storms intensify and the sea level rises, it predicted that storm surges previously described as 100-year events would become between five and 30 times as frequent.</p> <p>Four years ago, <a href=\"http://change.gov/newsroom/entry/president_elect_barack_obama_to_deliver_taped_greeting_to_bi_partisan_gover/\" title=\"\">Obama pledged that</a> \"my presidency will mark a new chapter in America's leadership on climate change\". He promised a federal cap and trade system and \"strong annual targets\" to reduce carbon pollution. But he ran into a ridge of high pressure. His cap and trade bill was killed in the Senate in 2010.</p> <p>At a meeting in the White House in 2009, his strategists decided that climate change was a banned topic: it caused too much trouble. From then onwards, Obama would talk about clean energy and green jobs and improvements in fuel economy, but would seldom explain why these shifts were necessary. The problem with this approach is that you cannot engineer a sustained reduction of greenhouse gas emissions only by getting into clean energy: you also have to get out of dirty energy. And that requires statesmanship: active and persuasive engagement with the public.</p> <p>In April, Obama <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/ready-for-the-fight-rolling-stone-interview-with-barack-obama-20120425\" title=\"\">said that global warming</a> \"will become part of the campaign\" and that he would be \"very clear\" about how he would deal with it. It hasn't happened. There were a couple of noncommittal paragraphs in his speech to the national convention, during which he also boasted that \"we've opened millions of new acres for oil and gas exploration in the last three years, and we'll open more.\" There was more of the same in the Democratic platform (the party's manifesto). Otherwise, this remains the issue that dare not speak its name. For the first time since 1984, climate change wasn't mentioned in any of the presidential debates.</p> <p>This, remember, is after a year of climate disasters: the droughts and wildfires that devastated much of the continental interior of the United States, the Arctic meltdown, the superstorm that ripped through the Caribbean before piercing the financial and spiritual heart of the nation. You wonder what it takes.</p> <p>As for Romney, his contribution has been confined to mockery. Even as hurricane Isaac cut short the Republican national convention, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/31/mitt-romney-obama-climate-change_n_1846440.html\" title=\"\">he ridiculed Obama</a>, to the delight of the delegates, for wanting to stop the sea level from rising. It was a revolting spectacle, which, in the aftermath of Sandy, would have become a major liability, had climate change not been taboo.</p> <p>In the Republican party platform, \"climate change\" \u2013 yes, in quotes \u2013 is mentioned only once, to <a href=\"http://www.gop.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/2012GOPPlatform.pdf\" title=\"\">attack Obama for taking it seriously</a>. The platform commits the party to blocking all effective measures to curb it, and to developing new coal (which Romney now professes to \"love\"), the Keystone XL tar sands pipeline and oil drilling on the outer continental shelf and in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Planetary ruin, for the Republicans, seems no longer to be an unfortunate side-effect of development: now it looks almost like a desirable end in itself; a test of manhood and corporate muscle.</p> <p>Successive polls show that an effective response to climate breakdown will not lose votes. Votes are not the problem: the problem is money and traction. Anyone who tries to address this subject encounters a storm surge of attack ads, obstruction and manufactured fury.</p> <p>During the crucial year \u2013 2009 \u2013 in which the cap and trade bill was struggling through Congress and governments were preparing for the summit in Copenhagen, environmental groups threw everything they had at climate change. After massive fundraising efforts, a coalition of green NGOs managed to find $22m for federal lobbying. But Exxon alone outspent them with a casual flick of the wallet. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2010/feb/01/exxonmobil-oil-profits-slump\" title=\"\">$27m it dropped into the counter-campaign</a> represented half of a day's profits. The other fossil fuel companies <a href=\"http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2010/08/pro-environment-groups-were-outmatc.html\" title=\"\">threw in a further $150m</a>. Without a major reform of both lobbying and campaign finance, the big money will keep winning. Protecting the planet and its people is impossible in a plutocracy.</p> <p>The Republicans in Congress have no choice but to keep obstructing or filibustering every means of addressing our foremost global crisis, for to alter their position would be to jeopardise their political funding. As David Roberts of <a href=\"http://grist.org/climate-energy/the-futility-of-climatespotting-no-matter-what-he-says-obama-cant-make-big-moves-on-climate/\" title=\"\">grist.org</a> points out, Obama has little incentive to talk about climate change when he knows that any promise he makes will be thwarted. All he can do is to \"fight for gridlock because gridlock is better than the alternative\".</p> <p>So the two candidates remain struck dumb. Speech fails them, action is abominable, they will not even raise their hands in self-defence. The world's most pressing crisis, now breaking down the doors of the world's most powerful nation, cannot be discussed.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 6 November 2012, to say that for the first time since 1984, climate change wasn't mentioned in any of the presidential debates.

  "<p>Pricey American universities look a lot more Hogwarts than their British counterparts. As one of the 10 most expensive private colleges in the US, Carnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh almost oppresses visitors with neo-gothic grandness; yet it was the setting this September for one of the scratchiest academic arguments I have ever heard.</p> <p>I was a guest of Carol Goldburg, the director of CMU's undergraduate economics programme, who had gathered a few colleagues to give their take on the presidential election. Here were four top economists huddled round a lunch table: they&#xa0;were surely going to regale me with talk of&#xa0;labour-market policy, global imbalances, marginal tax rates.</p> <p>My opener was an easy ball: how did they think President Obama had done? Sevin Yeltekin, an expert on political economy, was the first to respond: \"He hasn't delivered on a lot of his promises, but he inherited a big mess. I'd give him a solid B.\"</p> <p>I threw the same question to her neighbour and one of America's most renowned rightwing economists, Allan Meltzer. He snapped: \"A straight F: he took a mess and made it even bigger.\" Then came Goldburg, now wearing the look of a hostess whose guests are falling out: \"Well, I'm concerned about welfare and poverty, and Obama's tried hard on those issues.\" A tentative pause. \"B-minus?\"</p> <p>Finally it was the turn of Bennett McCallum, author of such refined works as <a href=\"http://papers.nber.org/papers/w9837\" title=\"\">Multiple-Solution Indeterminacies in Monetary Policy Analysis</a>. Surely he would bring the much-needed technical ballast? Um, no. \"D: he's trying to turn this country into France.\"</p> <p>Some of these comments were surely made for the benefit of their audience: faced with a mere scribbler, the scholars had evidently decided to hold the algebra, and instead talk human. Even so, this was a remarkable row. Here were four economists on the same faculty, who probably taught some of the same students; yet Obama's reputation depended on entirely on who was doing the assessment. The president was either B or F, good or a failure: opposite poles with no middle ground, and not even a joint agreement of the judging criteria.</p> <p>It's hardly news that US politics is now so polarised. You watch either Fox or MSNBC; you read these blogs or those; you're an Occupier or a Born Again. And you never talk to the other side. The playwright Arthur Miller summed up this state of affairs best during the 2004 election: \"How can the polls be neck and neck when I don't know one Bush supporter?\" Even so, what I saw in the dining hall at Carnegie Mellon showed just how divided US politics has become: that even technical experts no longer share a common language.</p> <p>Explaining the Great Gulf is now a cottage industry, with experts serving up a&#xa0;variety of paperback-ready explanations. It's all to do with how arguments are framed (George Lakoff); it's false consciousness (Thomas Frank); birds of the same socio-political feather flock together (Bill Bishop's The Great Sort). The most recent and radical thesis has been advanced by the evolutionary psychologist Jonathan Haidt, who argues that liberals and conservatives have different mental wiring.</p> <p>So far, so completely lacking in history. Go back to the 60s and the sense of continuity between Republicans and Democrats was strong enough that sociologists such as Daniel Bell wrote about The End of Ideology. And very few analysts have done the obvious thing of putting together America's political polarisation with the other great trend of the past 30 years: the chasm that has opened up between the rich and the rest.</p> <p>Rather than ask why US politics is broken, a&#xa0;more obvious question is surely: how can a society this divided produce anything but political gridlock?</p> <p>In their 2006 book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Polarized-America-Ideology-Walras-Pareto-Lectures/dp/0262633612/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1352197585&amp;sr=8-1\">Polarized America</a>, the political scientists Nolan McCarty, Keith Poole and Howard Rosenthal plotted the voting behaviour of elected representatives and their constituents, and compared them with the rise in inequality. They found an overwhelming link: as the US economy became more unequal from the 70s, its Congressmen and voters became increasingly extreme \u2013 and their incomes became an ever more reliable guide to their affiliations. The richest fifth of Americans are now 2.5&#xa0;times more likely to vote Republican than the bottom fifth, a trend that McCarty says didn't exist back in the 70s.</p> <p>And as the wealth gap increased, and voters became more polarised, the Republicans moved away from policies aimed at redistributing wealth&#xa0;and focused instead on cutting taxes and&#xa0;slashing regulation.</p> <p>This argument about voting with your wallet doesn't cancel out all the others about the role of values or religion. But the authors point out that even among evangelical Christians, the poor are far more likely to skew Democrat than those at the top. As for Congress, McCarty's vote-crunching leads him to pronounce this last parliament the most polarised since records began. And given that US inequality only intensified after&#xa0;the crash, there is little hope of any agreement on such issues as government spending or climate change.</p> <p>Supersize inequality leads to crashes, economists from the IMF to the Bank of England now agree. But it surely also corrodes democracy. One of Clinton's national security advisers, Richard Feinberg, observed: \"If a&#xa0;society fundamentally disagrees on fundamental issues \u2013 the nature of property and what&#xa0;constitutes a legitimate political system \u2013 democracy can't handle it.\" At the time, his words were a lecture to Latin American nations. Now they sound like a reproach to his own countrymen.</p>",

  "<p>This is not the first time Israel's political and security establishments have been at loggerheads, and it will not be the last.

After warning for months that Israeli action could not be put off, Binyamin Netanyahu told the UN general assembly in September that the moment of truth for the Iranian nuclear programme would come next spring or summer.</p> <p>Neither Meir Dagan nor Gabi Ashkenazi are still in office, but it appears their successors also have reservations about the wisdom of Israel attempting military action on its own. Benny Gatz <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/julian-borger-global-security-blog/2012/apr/25/israel-iran\" title=\"\">went on the record in April</a> to differ with Netanyahu on what constituted Israel's \"red line\".</p> <p>\"The current head of Mossad and the chief of staff are still not on the same page on this issue it seems to me,\" said Yossi Alpher, a former Iran analyst at the Mossad. \"As recently as six months ago they presented a picture quite different from that presented by Netanyahu and Barak.\"</p> <p>\"Meanwhile, Netanyahu has taken it off the agenda until spring and summer. This is about the influence of American pressure, opposition within the ranks, possible a change of mind by Barak \u2026 And he has seen from his own polling that the Israeli public is not in favour of a unilateral strike. This has calmed things down and there has been no perceived need for the heads of the security services to speak out about this recently.\"</p> <p>What to do about Iran's nuclear programme will be one of the issues hanging over Israel's elections on 22 January next year. How important it will be will depend on who takes part. If former prime minister Ehud Olmert and former foreign minister Tzipi Livni enter the ring, they are likely to attack Netanyahu as a loose cannon on Iran. Ashkenazi himself might also figure as an adviser or minister-designate for Olmert or Labour.</p> <p>But as Iran's nuclear programme advances, and as the country increases its stockpile of 20%-enriched uranium (the central proliferation concern) the gaps between the politicians and the security establishment will shrink, argues Danny Yatom, a former Mossad chief.</p> <p>\"There is a mutual understanding that Iran should not be nuclear, and I believe all the players share the belief that Iran will be nuclear when it has enough 20%-enriched uranium for a weapon,\" Yatom said.</p>",

  "<p>A portrait of Benjamin Franklin hangs in his office overlooking downtown Denver, but to critics Scott Gessler is no friend of the republic's founding principles.</p> <p>Colorado's secretary of state stands accused of purging the electoral roll in a bid to intimidate voters and boost Mitt Romney's chances of winning the swing state on Tuesday.</p> <p>Gessler, a staunch Republican, has sent thousands of letters to voters demanding proof they are citizens, or their removal from the register, in a controversial campaign against voter fraud which has alarmed immigrant and civil rights groups.</p> <p>\"There is tension out there. This has resonated in the immigration community,\" said Denise Maes, public policy director at the <a href=\"http://aclu-co.org/news/citizen-voters-frantic-after-receiving-gessler-challenge-letter\">American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado</a>. \"We don't know how many voters may be challenged on voting day.\"</p> <p>Some Democrats go further and accuse Gessler of disenfranchising ethnic minorities. \"I think it's disgusting that when the chips are down the Republicans try to keep people from voting,\" said Paul Lopez, a Denver city councilman.</p> <p>With polls showing Romney and Barack Obama tied in Colorado, a few thousand or even just a few hundred votes could tip the state's nine electoral college votes and catapult Gessler to the sort of fame, or infamy, of Katherine Harris, the secretary of state who helped tip Florida for George Bush in 2000.</p> <p>In a combative interview at his office this week Gessler rejected the accusations as smears and said the real threat to a clean vote was \"hear no evil, see no evil\" liberals who tolerated electoral fraud.</p> <p>\"What happens is they have voter registration drives and they don't care if [those who register] are citizens or not. We've seen it groups like Acorn,\" he said, referring to the non-governmental organisation which shut in 2010 after a successful conservative sting operation. </p> <p>\"Elections are how we award power in democracy. And some people are tempted to do bad things to get it. We have to take preventive measures to stop that from happening.\"</p> <p>Gessler grew up in Chicago, a city famous for political chicanery, but said his passion for cleaning voter rolls stemmed from his adopted state's razor-thin margins in local elections. \"We have a history of close races in Colorado.\"</p> <p>He showed the Guardian copies of letters from immigrants who had written to state officials reporting they had been placed on the electoral roll despite not being citizens. \"We know there's a problem.\"</p> <p>He rejected claims from the ACLU and other groups of negligible evidence of voter fraud. \"There are 10 to 12 million illegal immigrants in the US. What's the evidence they're not voting? There is no evidence either way. The absence of evidence of something doesn't prove it doesn't exist.\"</p> <p>Soon after election to his post last year, Gessler, a lawyer by training, launched a wide-ranging review of the electoral register and fought an ultimately successful battle to obtain data from the Department of Homeland Security.</p> <p>In August his office sent letters to 3,900 registered voters identified as potential non-citizens. His office said 141 were found to be non-citizens, of whom 35 had voted in previous elections. Last month letters were sent to 300 other suspected non-citizens.</p> <p>Maes, of the ACLU, said Gessler's investment of time and money to the issue was disproportionate. \"It's a solution in search of a problem.\" The letters had stirred unease among immigrants, she said. \"We're trying to soothe these concerns.\"</p> <p>Alan Kaplan, originally from Bielorussia, received one of the most recent letters despite the fact he has been a citizen since 2001. \"The letter was phrased in a very intimidating way. It seems to question your right to vote. It's had a chilling effect on immigrant communities. I think the timing, right before an election, is very suspect.\"</p> <p>Olivia Mendoza, executive director of <a href=\"http://www.cllaro.org/\">Claro</a>, a public policy group for Colorado Latinos, said Gessler was chasing a \"phantom fear\" and sowing confusion among legitimate voters. \"It's impacting the Latino community immensely, especially among what we call low-information voters.\"</p> <p>In some cases the letters were triggering a backlash, said Mendoza. \"It's almost like a call to arms, as if their ability to vote has been called into question.\"</p> <p>The secretary of state rebuffed such claims. \"There is no evidence, zero, that it's impacting Hispanics. Critics will play the race and the voter intimidation card at a moment's notice.\"</p> <p>Gessler, who has been embroiled in a separate row over <a href=\"http://www.denverpost.com/opinion/ci_21830383/editorial-gessler-needs-repay-taxpayers\">attending partisan political events on the public dime</a>, denied he was following the \"Florida playbook\" \u2013 a reference to that state's Republican-led voter roll \"cleansing\".</p> <p>He said his office had spent $1.1m registering Colorado voters, an initiative which netted more Democrats than Republicans, and that the state's electoral roll was cleaner than ever. He compared his campaign to installing fire alarms. \"Even if a building has no history of fires, it's something you do.\"</p>",
  "<p>In July, <a href=\"http://www.rollcall.com/issues/58_1/John-Boehner-Voters-Need-Not-Love-Mitt-Romney-215934-1.html\">a woman in West Virginia asked</a> Republican House speaker John Boehner \"Can you make me love Mitt Romney?\" Boehner said: \"No. Listen, we're just politicians. I wasn't elected to play God. The American people probably aren't going to fall in love with Mitt Romney.\"</p> <p>But that didn't stop <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/28/republican-task-animating-romney\">Romney's handlers trying</a>. They employed his wife Ann to soften him, invoked his Mormon religion to humanise him, and even called upon Clint Eastwood to vouch for him. But in the end, Boehner was right. The American people were never going to fall in love with him. Indeed, he could <a href=\"http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/mon-april-2-2012/indecision-2012---endless-suffrage-2012---jump-on-the-bandwagon-edition\">barely</a> get his own party to fall in love with him. Even his running mate, Paul Ryan, waited until the primaries were nearly over and his nomination inevitable, to endorse him with this warm embrace: \"I think we're entering a phase where it could become counterproductive if this drags on much longer, so that's why I think we have to coalesce as conservatives around Mitt Romney.\"</p> <p>Luckily for Romney, they didn't have to love him. In the six years he's been running for president, he's been reintroduced to the public several times to no avail. But when it came down to it, the public needed just 90 minutes during the<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/04/presidential-debate-romney-winner\"> first debate </a>to change their minds. It is telling that while almost everyone concedes he won the night almost nobody can remember a single thing he said. His victory was, in no small part, a reflection of Obama's hapless, hopeless defeat. But it was more than that. He may not have been loveable. But he was plausible \u2013 as a candidate, a human being and a potential president. And that was all he needed to be. Thanks to Obama's weaknesses the bar had been set incredibly low. He didn't even have to skip over it. Just a sure-footed step in the right direction sufficed.</p> <p>From then on, as his poll numbers rose and his confidence grew, the stench of possible victory attached itself to him, overpowering concerns about his likeability and authenticity. That was the smell that permeated the amphitheatre in suburban Denver on Saturday night as several thousand gathered in high spirits to hear the Republican standard-bearer. Unlike most Republican rallies earlier this year, including the convention, they were not going through the motions. They wanted to be there. Spontaneous chants of \"three more days\" rang out among a crowd in boisterous and belligerent mood. Every time Obama's name was mentioned, a man in front shouted, to general approval: \"He's a bum\". While most have clearly warmed to Romney, most there seemed more motivated by their fervent opposition to Obama. Nonetheless, the tone of disappointment rather than anger the Romney campaign had adopted clearly resonated with some. \"Obama's a great man,\" the man behind me whispered to his partner. \"He's just a terrible leader.\"</p> <p>Polls show a narrow majority of Americans believe Obama will win. At least one bookie is already paying out on an Obama victory. But the overwhelming majority of Republicans (71%) believe <a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/158444/americans-give-obama-better-odds-win-election.aspx?utm_source=alert&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=syndication&amp;utm_content=morelink&amp;utm_term=All%20Gallup%20Headlines\">Romney will be the victor</a>. They may be right.</p> <p>Romney is, in many ways, an inadequate conduit for all of this excitement. More comfortable with a PowerPoint presentation than a podium, his arrival on stage marks the end of expectation and the beginning of a more pedestrian affair. He appears without trace and delivers a checklist of Obama's failures and his own plans. It's a workmanlike strategy, which satisfied but hardly roused the Denver audience. The high point of the night came not with a searing indictment of Obama or a soaring projection of a Romney presidency, but with the <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/03/a-character-in-a-romney-campaign-anecdote-appears-on-the-trail/\">introduction of a scoutmaster</a> with the American flag that survived the explosion of the Challenger space shuttle in 1986. \"That is a great flag representing the greatest nation in the history of the earth,\" Mr Romney concluded. A touching story, no doubt. But not one that will get laggards to the polls.</p> <p>But a crowd that comes with the express intention of being inspired is difficult to disappoint. He gave them what they wanted and they went home happy.</p> <p>\"Change can't be measured in speeches,\" he said. \"It is measured in achievements \u2026&#xa0;I won't just represent one party. I'll represent one nation.\"</p> <p>This, it turns out, is where the Etch-a-Sketch image has settled \u2013 one-nation Republicanism. No longer the severe conservative ideologue, but the uniter and doer. The turnaround man who can fix the country like he fixed the Olympics, and work with Democrats in Congress like he did in Massachusetts. The fact that it would be voiced to great cheers here, in Colorado, where he suffered a shock defeat to arch-conservative Rick Santorum during the primaries, is illuminating.</p> <p>For in the <a href=\" http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0912/81280.html \">pre-mortems</a> of Romney's candidacy, when it was widely assumed that he was going to lose, the accusation was always that his personality and his campaign were his main liabilities. There were indeed issues with both.</p> <p>Democrats had used the summer to <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/feb/29/mitt-romney-republican-nomination-win-michigan \">frame him</a> as effete and heartless corporate raider \u2013 a theme that had taken hold during the <a href=\"http://www.thenation.com/article/166810/romney-and-santorum-two-faces-gop-capitalism\">primaries</a>. Newt Gingrich branded him a \"vulture capitalist\" for his work at Bain Capital. Back in 2008, his opponent, Mike Huckabee, said: \"[Romney] looks like the guy who fires you, not the guy who hires you.\"</p> <p>By the time the Democrats got to him, the ground had been prepared. Throughout, Romney duly obliged by making $10,000 bets during debates, casually referring to his wife's couple of Cadillacs, and being caught on video disparaging almost half the country.</p> <p>\"I get the feel he's more for big business,\" one supporter in Lansing, Michigan, told me at a Santorum rally. \"I love Nascar, but he has friends who own Nascar teams, and it's difficult to relate to that.\" He emerged from the primary battles damaged and deeply scarred.</p> <p>But a far bigger problem for Romney was the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/23/romney-us-presidential-elections-republicans \">party he sought to represent</a>. To run for the Republican nomination he had to run away from his record as a governor and a senatorial candidate. His support for abortion rights, gun control and healthcare reform and his bipartisan record all had to be denied or distorted for his nomination to stand a chance. On issues like contraception, immigration and taxation, to make sense within the Republican party was to make no sense outside it.</p> <p>Party elders watched in horror as debate crowds cheered Texas governor Rick Perry when he was introduced as a man who'd overseen 234 executions. Rudy Giuliani said that the candidates' statements on some social issues \"make the party look like it isn't a modern party.\" Jeb Bush worried that the candidates were \"appealing to people's fears and emotion,\" and wondered if he could still count himself among them. \"I used to be a conservative,\" he said. To win, Romney had to scare away Latinos and women \u2013 and many remain scared.</p> <p>Even Romney insisted he had his limits. In February he said: \"It's very easy to excite the base with incendiary comments \u2026 I'm not willing to light my hair on fire to try and get support. I am who I am.\" By July, Sarah Palin was insisting that if he couldn't blow himself up the very least he could do was light her candle. (\"Well, light our hair on fire, then!\" she told Fox News).</p> <p>The first debate marked the beginning of his revival because it signalled the moment he started running away from the his primary stances and back towards his record \u2013 or at least part of it. He posed as the moderate who could reach across the aisle and get things done in Massachusetts. If this has made him viable, it has left him no less vulnerable. For every position he takes, there is at least one <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPgfzknYd20\">youtube clip</a> of taking a contrary position elsewhere.</p> <p>His Republican base do not seem to mind that, so long as they think it is a winning strategy. When they selected him, albeit grudgingly, they traded authenticity for viability. They preferred someone who could beat Obama to someone who was right. Now it's Romney's turn to fulfil his part of the deal. With just one day to go, the polls are so tight and close they can almost smell it.</p>",
  "<p>Barring a complete and systematic failure of pretty much every single polling organization in America, Barack Obama will be re-elected president of the United States Tuesday night.</p> <p>Still, no matter what happens on Tuesday \u2013 and even if Mitt Romney pulls off the most extraordinary political surprise in the history of American presidential campaigns \u2013 the more than 18-month slog for the White House provides us with rather clear outlines on the changing nature of the US electorate and the ideological positioning of the two parties. While it would be incomplete and, indeed, probably incorrect to call this a realignment election, there are a number of crucial takeaways from campaign 2012 \u2013 and they augur much brighter days ahead for Democrats than for Republicans.</p> <h2>The Republican party's continued descent into madness</h2> <p>The single most defining element of American politics over the last four years is that the Republican party has fallen out of the crazy tree and hit every branch on the way down. It is no longer even appropriate to say the Republican party is dominated by its conservative wing; but rather, that the GOP is controlled by its extreme, radical wing.</p> <p>The shift of the Republican to the far, far right is not a recent development. Instead, it is reflective of a four-decade shift in ideological orientation in the GOP: from a party once torn between distinct conservative and moderate wings, to one in which moderates have gone the way of dinosaurs and VCRs. But there is no question that in the past four years, the extremism of the GOP has increased dramatically \u2013 so much so that their most recent president, George W Bush, is persona non grata in the party because he is viewed as <em>too moderate</em> and not sufficiently conservative. Imagine that.</p> <p>For years, the national Republican party emboldened this wing of the GOP and made it the vanguard of its efforts to maintain national power. That group now holds ideological sway in the Republican party. In the naked pursuit of short-term partisan gain, the Republican party has unleashed forces that it can no longer fully control.</p> <p>The result is a set of policies that not only are radical, but also are out of step with the mainstream of American politics. This includes everything from efforts to privatize Medicare, eviscerating social security, rejecting any role for fiscal policy other than cutting taxes, and taking the position that illegal immigrants should not receive amnesty but rather \"self-deport\". This is not to mention the GOP's growing extremism on abortion rights and reproductive health in general.</p> <p>Republicans once aspired to, and briefly held, the mantle of a party of ideas. Today, the GOP in its deference to the ideological rigidity of its radical wing has reached a position where Republicans have no serious ideas for reforming healthcare, creating jobs, stimulating the economy, or fixing the nation's crumbling infrastructure. They also have no proposals for achieving energy independence and certainly no thought as to how to save the planet \u2013 particularly since they reject almost unanimously the science underpinning global warming. (Well, I take that back: Republicans have one policy for all these issues \u2013 cut taxes and trim regulation.)</p> <p>This has forced their party standard-bearer, a technocratic moderate from Massachusetts, to become a caricature of a modern conservative. In the process, Romney has adopted a host of toxic policy positions and rhetoric (<a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/09/watch-full-secret-video-private-romney-fundraiser\">remember the 47%</a>) that has dramatically undermined his candidacy. It's always difficult to beat an incumbent president; it's even more difficult when you're not a very good politician. But when your own party hangs around your neck policy positions that narrow, rather than increase, your chances of being elected, it becomes a herculean task. </p> <p>To be sure, one of the most important drivers of the Republican's rightward turn has been the unceasing obstructionism toward President Obama's agenda. From early on, the GOP decided that, for political reasons, it must oppose everything he wanted to do. It was an approach that kept the economy under-performing but did help return Republicans to power in the House of Representatives in 2010. Blanket opposition to Obama's policies and, in particular, economic stimulus is pretty much the only reason this election is even close.</p> <p>If Obama is to win on 6 November, it's possible that Republicans will, at least in the near term, narrow their steadfast hostility to him. Indeed, even against their better judgment, they may find themselves compromising with the White House on the Bush tax cuts and sequestration, just as they compromised on the payroll tax cut in 2012, over the 2011 budget showdown and even on the debt limit.</p> <p>Providing Obama with the stimulus he has so desperately sought, for the past four years, might even suddenly seem acceptable, particularly if a boost in the economy helps incumbent congressional Republicans keep their constituents happy \u2013 and their jobs in place, at the next midterm elections in 2014. Of course, that doesn't mean anyone should get their hopes up: Republicans will still continue to oppose any use of government power and resources to ameliorate social inequalities. And as we get closer to midterm elections in 2014, as well as the next presidential race, it's quite possible, even likely, that GOP obstructionism and obstinacy will get worse.</p> <p>If Romney wins, congressional Republicans might be even less inclined to compromise, but it won't matter much. No one expects them to take back control of the Senate, which means the Republicans' far-right agenda will go no further than the House of Representatives (at least for the first two years of a Romney presidency). If Republicans were to take back the Senate in 2014 (<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate_elections,_2014\">a possibility that can't be completely discounted</a>), this would be a very different story. One could expect them to make a desperate push to enact some variation of the Ryan budget \u2013 and probably succeed.</p> <p>Still, one of the great ironies of this election \u2013 and the capture of the GOP by its extreme wing \u2013 is that if Romney were to emerge victorious, he would be protected from having to enact a more radically conservative agenda \u2026 by Harry Reid. In fact, if Romney were to win, he might even end up being a fairly popular and successful president.</p> <h2>Demographics are destiny</h2> <p>The problem for Republicans, however, is what happens if he loses. In no area of American politics are Republicans more vulnerable and Democrats in better position to capitalize than when it comes to the country's changing demographic make-up. </p> <p>Consider, for a moment, this paradox. On Tuesday night, Barack Obama could potentially lose white voters by 20 points. He's going to get crushed among white men \u2013 and he's still likely to be re-elected, maybe even comfortably.</p> <p>The reason for this is clear: among non-whites, Obama enjoys an extraordinary advantage. Aside from winning practically the entire African-American vote, Obama is likely to prevail among Hispanic voters by considerably more than 30 points. The latest <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/burns-haberman/\">Latino Decisions poll has him up nearly 50 points</a>.</p> <p>Among younger voters, he is likely to dominate as well. In short, among the demographic groups that represent the future of the American electorate, Democrats enjoy an enormous edge \u2013 and one that will only become more pronounced.</p> <p>It's not hard to understand why this has happened. Young people who came of age in the Bush years naturally gravitated toward Obama. Moreover, these voters tend to be aligned on social issues with Democrats. On the flip side, GOP positions on immigration have alienated Hispanics and moved them toward the Democrats. Beyond young people and minorities, women voters have increasingly turned their back on the GOP because of its uncompromising stances on abortion and reproductive health, as well as the party's attitude toward poverty programs and maintaining the social safety net.</p> <p>Republicans have, for decades, relied on the support of whites, religious and cultural voters, and on rural residents. If Obama were to win Tuesday, it would provide conclusive evidence that this is no longer a 50.1% coalition \u2013 and that for Republicans to win back the presidency, they must broaden their share of the electorate.</p> <p>But here's the rub: there is no easy way for them to do it. Even if Republicans could find a way to work with Obama on an issue like immigration reform (an unlikely scenario considering the die-hard opposition of the Tea Party), a legislative victory for the president would only serve to strengthen his support in the Hispanic community. If Republicans oppose reform, however, they will only dig their hole deeper with the fastest growing demographic group in the country. In fact, if Obama were smart, he would make the Dream Act and comprehensive immigration reform one of his first legislative priorities in 2013.</p> <p>On abortion and reproductive health, it's virtually impossible to imagine any sort of compromise coming from the GOP. And so long as the party has Senate candidates talking about \"legitimate rape\" and children born as a result of rape being gifts from God, things are likely to get worse for the Republican party, before they get better. The same goes for gay marriage and other social issues.</p> <h2>A bluer map</h2> <p>The Democrats' evolving political coalition has also shifted the electoral map in a bluer direction. In states like <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/01/in-nevada-obama-ryan-and-signs-of-a-new-democratic-leaning-normal/\">Nevada</a> and New Mexico, Democrats enjoy a huge advantage because of those states' large Hispanic population. Similar trends can be seen in Colorado, Florida and even Iowa. It is not hard to imagine that Democratic dominance among Hispanic voters will soon put Arizona and even, potentially, Texas in play.</p> <p>In places like Ohio, <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/04/in-virginia-its-tradition-versus-change/\">Virginia</a> and North Carolina, the Democrats' overwhelming advantage among minority voters and, increasingly, among college-educated whites \u2013 another key element of the emerging Democratic coalition \u2013&#xa0;has put these states into play and even leaning blue.</p> <p>Flip the map for a second to look at it from a Republican perspective and things get ugly quickly. Look, for example, at the <a href=\"http://electoralmap.net/PastElections/past_elections.php?year=2000\">2000 electoral map</a>. Of the states won by Al Gore that year, only Iowa and perhaps Wisconsin are even in play this cycle. Conversely, seven states that Bush won that year are swing states or leaning Democratic. From a starting point of 271 electoral votes (one more than the bare minimum needed to win a national election), Republicans have seen their electoral map narrow rather than widen.</p> <h2>A recovering economy</h2> <p>There is one final consideration. As the economy has steadily improved, so, too, have President Obama's approval ratings. All economic indicators indicate that this will be a continuing trend, which means that if Obama were to win Tuesday, he would see his political standing rise as unemployment continues to fall. (Of course, if Romney were to win, he would be the beneficiary of this improving economy.) Throw in the fact that as Obamacare becomes the law of the land and provides a new entitlement for middle-class Americans, the Democrat's long-term policy advantage could be strengthened even further.</p> <p>None of this is meant to suggest that Republicans won't continue to be a competitive national party. The problem, however, is similar to that faced by Democrats 20-30 years ago: when your base is shrinking, how do you appeal to a broader cross-section of the electorate?</p> <p>The fact is, there is no easy way for Republicans do it. The GOP needs desperately to reform itself, to cast aside its most radical and extreme wing, and to moderate its policies to appeal to an electorate that is dramatically changing. Democrats simply need to continue the policies \u2013 and political approach \u2013 that has given them a political advantage going into election day.</p> <p>What this means is that, should Romney lose tomorrow and Obama emerge victorious, we may be on the cusp of a dramatic shift in national politics.</p>",

  "<p>Four years ago, on the eve of election day 2008, Barack Obama held his final rally. Those in the vast crowd that night in Manassas, Virginia, remember it as a moment of political magic.</p> <p>One writer described it later as this generation's Woodstock moment. It brought together young and old, from different ethnic backgrounds, gathering in their tens of thousands next to a famous civil war battlefield as America was on the verge of electing its first black president.</p> <p>It was a chaotic evening, with Obama running late, not speaking until close to midnight. The rally was held in a field, next to a fairground, which, added to low-lying fog, gave proceedings a slightly surreal glow.</p> <p>Roads were blocked for miles around such was the press of people wanting to see him, cars abandoned by the roads miles back. Police estimated the crowd at 80,000, while the Obama campaign put it at 100,000. Either way, it was one of the biggest turnouts of the entire campaign.</p> <p>Skip forward to the closing days of the 2012 campaign, and Obama was once again in Prince William County. But Saturday night was a more orderly affair. The crowd, at 24000, was big for a bitterly cold evening, but nowhere close to the 2008 event. There was not the same level of excitement, the wild expectations for Obama in 2008 having largely gone unrealised.</p> <p>And yet, many of those who had been at the Manassas fairground four years earlier had turned out once again, and were willing to wait in the long lines to get into the event on Saturday. So how had they fared since the man they came to see that night entered the White House. The Guardian spoke to six of them to as how the felt about Obama now. </p> <p>They have been touched by the recession but not badly. They expressed tinges of disappointment but echoed little of the disillusionment expressed by the left elsewhere. And they blamed Republicans in Congress rather than Obama for what has gone wrong.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398874063\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/5/1352135468378/63b94a4e-384e-4401-8c22-495c1fde0f51-460.jpeg\" alt=\"Barack Obama in Virginia\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Four years on: Obama in Bristow on Saturday night.

It made me so proud to see so many different people, black and white, young and old, so many different ethnic groups. We waited for five hours. </p> <p>\"The Civil War was about slavery and here we stood admiring a man that if it had been 150 years ago might have been a slave. I felt empowered by thinking about how far we have. </p> <p>\"I feel we have made progress. The housing market bottomed out but it is getting better. I have been fine. This is the first year we had had a raise. But we are not in teaching for the money. \"</p> <h2>Rachel Palmer, 55</h2> <p><em>An artist from Fairfax County, Virginia, originally from the Philippines. She makes her living doing murals for people's homes, and is married with three daughters.</em></p> <p>\"He came late. People were waiting in the field and it was cold. There was just so much energy. Every ethnic group was there. It was just a microcosm of America. People were standing shoulder-to-shoulder and smiling. They were just so charged up.</p> <p>\"I am not disillusioned; I voted for Obama and will vote for him again. I think he did a good job given what he was faced with. There are things I wish he had worked faster on: I would like to have seen him balancing the budget in the first years, and I am not complaining when you see all the things he has fixed. Overall, it has been a hard but uplifting four years.</p> <p>\"I think the country is getting better. I work on my own. Business went down during the Bush years, but this last year I have seen a rise in clientele. I'm not charging what I used to.\"</p> <h2>Mark Palmer, 55</h2> <p><em>Rachel's husband, a family photographer, was also in Manassas four years ago.</em></p> <p>\"It was good to see the diversity that night: there were a lot of white people there, ready to vote for a black president. I think the fact that Manassas as a civil war battlefield played into it. It was a good thing to see in America. There is a lot of division in our country now. But look at this crowd: it is pretty diversified. You wouldn't see that at a Mitt Romney rally.</p> <p>\"People are tighter with money these days, and not spending as much on pictures. It is seen as a luxury, not a necessity. I have had to diversify, taking photographs of products such as food.\"</p> <h2>Gion Battle, 43</h2> <p><em>A secretary at Siemens, born and raised in Alexandria, Virginia. Moved to Manassas in 1999, and married with two girls and son.</em></p> <p>\"It was exciting in 2008 \u2013&#xa0;it was like there was electricity in the air. He was late but no-one cared. We would have stayed all night. It was a really diverse mix of people. If you look at Romney events, it is a sea of white faces. You get a more diverse mix with President Obama.</p> <p>\"I resent people who say I vote for Obama because he is an African American, who chalk up his success to the African American support. I don't vote on the basis of colour; I didn't vote for Jesse Jackson.</p> <p>\"I am disappointed. Not with Obama, but with the unprecedented level of obstructionism he has faced. I was laid off from my job for a few months. I don't blame Obama. These things happen whoever the president is. I am better off economically. I have renovated the house, I have a 55in TV. It is my mom cave and there is a brand new car in the driveway.\"</p> <h2>Debbie Peterman, 56</h2> <p><em>A science teacher, originally from Richmond, Virginia, and now living in Manassas, married with two children.</em></p> <p>\"It was a little chilly that night, a little foggy. I looked behind me and it was wall-to-wall Democrats. I was so proud that in Virginia so many people would come out only hours before the election.</p> <p>\"I am not disappointed \u2013 I think you have to realise that the damage that was done could not be sorted in four years. The fall in house prices let teachers buy houses. I have been very lucky. My husband is a teacher and we got a raise this year of 3%. I teach science and I am glad he Obama is pushing alternative energy sources.\"</p> <h2>Earl McCuller, 52</h2> <p><em>An IT consultant with Booz Allen, originally from North Carolina, served in the army for 23 years, before settling in Bristow. </em></p> <p>\"The reason I came to the rally is because of how electrifying it was last time. I came by myself last time but I brought my wife this time. </p> <p>\"I am happy with the presidency. We are definitely better off. Our investments went down in 2008 but they are back up to the level they were. There have not been many jobs lost in our neighbourhood. In 2008 there were a lot of foreclosures. Before Obama took office foreclosures were going up every day. There were people just walking away from their houses. But there are no foreclosures now.\"</p>",
  "<p>Mining shares led the market lower on renewed worries about a slowdown in China and news that Australia was scrapping plans for additional listings for foreign companies.</p> <p>Disappointing non-manufacturing data from China - a key consumer of commodities - sent copper prices to a two month low and hit the whole resources sector. <strong>Kazakhmys</strong> closed 17.5p lower at 717.5p, <strong>Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation</strong> fell 12.2p to 321.3p and <strong>Rio Tinto</strong> lost 69p to \u00a331.45. <strong>Vedanta Resources</strong> dropped 42p to \u00a311.18, not helped by Citigroup downgrading the group from buy to neutral.</p> <p>On top of that, Australia's stock exchange has reportedly decided against a proposal to quote unsponsored depository receipts of foreign companies. If the move had gone ahead it would have narrowed the spread for dual listed companies like Rio and <strong>BHP Billiton</strong>, 30.5p lower at 1991.5p.</p> <p>The sector's decline weighed on the whole market, leaving the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> 29.49 points lower at 5839.06. There were also poor monthly service sector surveys from UK and US, while investors were unsettled by the imminent American election, as well as the forthcoming vote in the Greek parliament on its austerity package and 2013 budget.</p> <p>Angus Campbell, head of market analysis at Capital Spreads, said:</p> <blockquote> Markets trod cautiously at the beginning of this week as uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the US presidential elections dominated trade putting investors on the back foot. With the outcome far from certain the future shape of the US political landscape remains in doubt. With both candidates offering two very separate paths the result of this election is as significant for the US economy as much as it is for the global economy. </blockquote> <p>Banks were also under pressure. <strong>HSBC</strong> fell 8.1p to 618p following a disappointing update and news of hefty money laundering fines, while <strong>Lloyds Banking Group</strong> lost 0.575p to 42.85p despite weekend reports it was considering a sale of its 60% stake in wealth manager <strong>St James Place</strong>, down 3.6p to 394.9p. Gary Greenwood at Shore Capital said:</p> <blockquote> At the current share price, Lloyds stake is worth around \u00a31.2bn, albeit we think the shares are currently undervalued by the market, so a sale at this price would not maximise value for Lloyds' shareholders. </blockquote> <p>Two years after <strong>Prudential</strong> failed to buy Asian rival AIA, the insurer has made a move in the fast growing region.</p> <p>In another challenge to AIA, Pru is paying \u00a3368m in cash for Thailand's Thanachart Bank, following its announcement of plans to open an office in Cambodia. The deal includes a 15 year exclusive partnership to sell bancassurance in Thailand through Thanachart branches.</p> <p>The Pru's shares slipped 2.5p to 856p, and Andy Hughes at Exane BNP Paribas repeated his underperform rating.</p> <p>Heading in the other direction was <strong>Weir</strong>, up 80p at \u00a318.31, after the pumps and valves group said it was on track to meet full year expectations despite a weak oil and gas sector.</p> <p>Accounting software specialist <strong>Sage</strong> added 1.9p to 313.6p as Numis raised its recommendation from hold to add.</p> <p>But George O'Connor at Panmure Gordon kept his sell rating despite applauding some of the company's moves:</p> <blockquote> Research from industry analysts IDC points to European IT users accelerating their 'cloud' deployment. Fortunately Sage is just in time demonstrably weaving cloud technology into its core products \u2013 we note CRM and ERP X3 in particular. While the moves may seem piecemeal they do not appear to be a case of 'too little/too late' but will do little to drive Sage's missing ingredient - growth. <br> Our sell recommendation is predicated on those false take-over stories (gone in a puff of smoke) which have inflated the share price and lead to a valuation, a PE of 16.5 times, well ahead of the operational and valuation reality. </blockquote> <p><strong>Centamin</strong> recovered some of the ground which it lost last week on reports an Egyptian court had ruled its rights to operate the Sukari gold mine were invalid.</p> <p>The reports wiped around 40% off its share price, but the company eased some of the concerns, and they bounced back 14.05p to 74.55p, a 23% increase which made it the biggest riser in the FTSE 250.</p> <p>It has now received the court's ruling, which rejected any attempt to terminate the company's concession agreement although it said insufficient evidence had been submitted to demonstrate ministerial approval had been given to allow the company to mine.</p> <p>Centamin said it would appeal the decision and maintained it had documents showing the minister of petroleum and mineral resources had given approval, although these were somehow not in the court papers</p> <p>But <strong>Telecity</strong> dropped 78p to 835p despite an in-line update, as the European data centre operator unveiled what analysts said was an expensive - albeit small - acquisition.</p> <p>The company said trading remained strong across Europe, and its full year earnings were expected to be in line with City forecasts. But it also announced the \u20ac28m cash purchase of Academica in Finland. Analyst James Goodman at Investec said:</p> <blockquote> At \u20ac28m for 1MW of operational capacity, today's (admittedly small) deal seems very expensive. However, the business has an expansion plan to quadruple the capacity to 4MW which would clearly lessen the price, but would depend on the incremental capital expenditure required. </blockquote> <p><strong>Dixons Retail</strong>, boosted last week following news that rival Comet was going into administration, suffered a bout of profit taking as investors had second thoughts about how much benefit the electrical retailer would actually get from the situation. Dixons dipped 0.93p to 24.91p.</p>",
  "<p>The US elections have serious implications for Pakistan and policy making, but that is not reflected in popular debate or discussion.</p> <p>While government officials complain that there is little chance of key issues, such as efforts to draw the Taliban into a political process, being dealt with before the the election, public interest in the contest is virtually nil.</p> <p>Perhaps that is not surprising with anti-Americanism appearing to be at an all-time high in Pakistan.</p> <p>There has been little media interest in the campaign, with some of the most recent reports about the US president concerning the burning of effigies of him to protest against a blasphemous anti-Islam film posted on YouTube.</p> <p>There is certainly none of the enthusiasm Obama mustered in the Muslim world in 2008, said Munawar Hasan, president of the conservative Islamic party Jamaat-e-Islami.</p> <p>\"After the last four years people now know that Americans are Americans and George Bush and Barack Obama are two sides of the same coin,\" he said, damning US policy on the region, including the sharp increase in drone strikes and the troop surge in Afghanistan. No one is interested in this election because, whoever wins, US foreign policy is not going to change.\"</p> <p>Some suspect the country's military establishment may harbour a stronger desire to see the back of Obama as his administration, in sharp contrast to that of George Bush (and Republican governments in general), was not afraid of playing rough with Pakistan, even at the expense of humiliating its armed forces.</p> <p>The May 2011 raid to kill Osama bin Laden within Pakistani territory still haunts the army and the country has struggled to cope with the massive increase in US drone attacks on its tribal areas.</p> <p>Even worse was the accidental US airstrike on the Afghan border last year which killed 24 troops and prompted months of acrimony between Islamabad and Washington.</p>",
  "<p>So, to everyone who's freaking out about the possibility of a Romney victory: I have a weird but unshakable faith in this country.</p> <p>I know both whom I want to win, and whom I want to lose: this isn't a \"lesser of two evils\" election for me. Whatever flaws scar Obama's first administration (drones, cough, drones; watered-down Wall Street reform, cough), I find them proactively superior to Romney's. And no matter who wins, an invasion of zombie hordes is a long-shot outcome. (As Joss Whedon <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2012/10/29/joss-whedon-warns-that-mitt-romney-could-spur-zombie-apocalypse/\">advises</a>, you might collect canned goods and practice <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkour\">parkour</a>, anyway; Romney's ahead of us on that score.)</p> <p>Over time, we in the US tend to do OK. We've made serious mistakes as a country, sometimes dodging apocalypse or genocide by a combination of luck and sheer bloodymindedness. We've let our government take action in gruesome ways \u2013 internment camps, Vietnam, Iraq. And, as citizens, we've stood by while injustices rolled over other people's lives (this individualized list is too painful and too long to articulate).</p> <p>But we tend to learn from our mistakes; we tend to correct them, as best we can. Our always re-enforced self-interest and offhand sense of fairness produces a kind of lazy arc toward justice. Frustration and outrage bring wars to an end (\"We're still in Iraq? Why?\"). Protest and disenchantment with pursuing a failing cause allow rights to expand (\"I'm not going to get up off the couch to keep gays from marrying\").</p> <p>Romney's vision of the America in the rearview mirror is a comparatively lonely one. Nostalgia only beckons those who haven't seen progress. Women don't want a return to a time when they couldn't sit in a boardroom without holding a steno pad, or only have control over their bodies if no one knew about it. Black people don't want to roll the clock back to racial double-vision and divide. Gay men and women don't want to give up the simple gift of visibility (or even the right to serve in the military).</p> <p>And however much a Romney administration might push for policies that inch us toward the past, such moves will find resistance. The No 1 force moving America forward is the inertia of tiny gains. But, by golly, those add up: there's a black man in the White House \u2013 and that can never ever be undone.</p> <p>We're stubborn about hanging on to what we have \u2013 and that's why a Romney presidency worries me but doesn't unhinge me. Bad things will happen if he becomes president, no doubt \u2013 though much depends on his being able to push through the terrible, terrible policies he's apparently in favor of (unless now Etch-a-Sketched away). In fact, that might be tricky: the whole \"repealing Obamacare\" promise is, on its own, the kind of indolent campaign <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/romneys-pledge-repeal-obamacare-elected-165418907.html\">rhetoric</a> that betrays just how little thought Romney has given to what actual governance and practical obstacles entail. </p> <p>As for those worried about an Obama victory: you chill out, too. I'm not capitalism's biggest fan, but it's proven to be pretty durable. Warnings about how regulations will keep entrepreneurs from following their dreams and how \"government handouts\" will impoverish charities and lure the poor into indolence fly in the face of history and human nature. Tax rates as high as 90% for top income earners during the Great Depression somehow didn't translate into calling each other \"comrade\" and having options as varied as Brand A and Brand A at the corner store. Our growing acknowledgment of the need for environmental stewardship produces, if nothing else, new and exciting ways to dodge such regulations. And families keep trying to better themselves. I see proof of this every day.</p> <p>The chorus of fear-mongering from the furthest right is as galling as it is rootless. The idea that Obama wants to institute socialism, or make America subservient to the rest of the world? This hyperbole indicates a lack of faith in one's own country so profound that <em>it</em> should scare people, not the warnings themselves. The people who prey on fear and hate are the ones most likely to mask atrocities with Mobius-strip logic: we had to burn the village in order to save it.</p> <p>I don't believe these warning themselves, either, and I don't think I have reason to. You folks who worry about such things? I guess I believe in America more than you.</p>",

Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show that the UK's biggest companies increased their cash reserves by over \u00a380bn between 2007 and 2011. There is no excuse for cash-rich employers to deny low-paid staff a decent wage, says the TUC.</p> <p>The TUC added that paying the living wage is in the interests of employers, as it improves staff motivation and productivity, and enhances corporate reputations.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2012/11/Livingwage051112\">\u2022 John Swinney, the Scottish finance minister, says the Scottish government will pay the living wage to Scottish public sector workers.</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://blogs.independent.co.uk/2012/11/05/the-pony-politics-of-the-living-wage/?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter\">\u2022 John Rentoul on his blog says that Miliband's support for the living wage is irresponsible.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The basic problem is one of unequal returns in the labour market. The Labour government made important advances, such as the national minimum wage and spreading higher educational standards, although it also decided to allow free movement of low-skilled central European workers, which may have kept low wages lower. Overall, though, income inequality in the UK did not change significantly in the Labour period.</p> <p>But, yes, it would be nice if differentials were smaller. The tax system is doing its bit, even if the Coalition Government is <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/how-the-tax-facts-get-in-the-way-of-the-tory-story-8229280.html\">too incompetent to collate the figures</a>. So how can the gap between high and low pre-tax pay be narrowed? Ed Miliband accepts that simply putting up the minimum wage for everyone, which would seem to be fair and fiscally expansionary, would put people out of work.</p> <p>So he takes refuge in the warm marshmallow fudge of the Living Wage. Banks, who don\u2019t employ many people on low wages, should pay it. And public-sector employers. Apart from the NHS, obviously. And any other \u201csocially responsible\u201d company that can be morally coerced into it. What about contract staff and suppliers and cleaners employed by friends of the MD\u2019s tennis partners? Do they have to pay the Living Wage too? No doubt a working party is being set up now.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://labourlist.org/2012/11/the-living-wage-is-a-good-idea-but-we-could-and-should-do-more/\">\u2022 Mark Ferguson at LabourList says the living wage does not go far enough.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>If we accept that the National Minimum Wage still leaves people living in abject poverty \u2013 and it does \u2013 then why are we willing to accept that as a legal wage floor? If the Living Wage is the level at which people can be reasonably expected to live and support themselves, why don\u2019t we demand that the NMW is set at that level? To do otherwise is to tacitly accept that some will still be employed on poverty wages. I find that difficult to stomach.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/staggers/2012/11/where-next-living-wage\">\u2022 Matthew Pennycook at the Staggers says there is still a long way to go in extending the living wage.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>For all the success of the living wage campaign relatively few workers have secured a higher wage as a result of a living wage initiative. For example, there are an estimated 651,953 workers in London earning less than the London Living Wage, yet only around 10,341 London workers won a living wage in the six years between 2005 and 2011. This is not a cry of despair, simply a call for realism about the role that living wage initiatives can play in tackling our reliance on an extensive pool of low-paid labour and for targeting efforts where they will be most effective.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2012/11/how-much-would-milibands-living-wage-plans-actually-change\">\u2022 Jon Stone at the Staggers says Miliband's proposal to \"name and shame\" firms not paying the living wage may have disappointing results.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Miliband\u2019s pledge recalls the strategy of anti-tax-avoidance protest group UK Uncut, which drew attention to high profile companies that avoided large sums of tax, in the hope of shaming them into paying more.

The Welsh Government takes these allegations very seriously.</p> <p>In the first instance, victims of abuse who feel that the abuse they suffered was not investigated properly should report their cases to the police. My officials have been in touch with North Wales Police.</p> <p>An extensive inquiry into North Wales child abuse \u2013 the so-called Waterhouse Report was published in 2000. It was commissioned - before devolution began- by the then Secretary of State for Wales William Hague and reported to Paul Murphy, as Secretary of State, in 2000. It made extensive recommendations for improving child protection, many of which were subsequently implemented by the Welsh Government. I have asked for urgent advice on the terms of reference of the Waterhouse Inquiry at the time when it was set up.&#xa0;</p> <p>I need to understand fully what was included in those terms of reference and what was excluded.

When it was pointed out that he has not held a general press conference at Number 10 all year, the spokesman said that Cameron always holds a press conference when he visits Brussels for European council meetings, which now take place about once a month.

But I already know what he is going to say, because the party released<a href=\"http://www.labour.org.uk/the-living-wage-can-help-us-rebuild-britain-as-one-nation\"> a text of his remarks in advance.</a> Here's an extract.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are almost five million people in Britain who aren\u2019t earning enough the living wage; people who got up early this morning, spent hours getting to work - who are putting in all the effort they can - but who often don\u2019t get paid enough to look after their families, to heat their homes, feed their kids, care for elderly relatives and plan for the future ...</p> <p>It\u2019s not how it should be in Britain, it\u2019s not how we will succeed as a country in the years ahead because we can't go on with an economy that works for a few at the top and not for most people. We need to change it ...</p> <p>Britain needs a government that will work with the best of British business to build greater prosperity and share it more fairly. That is what One Nation is about. The living wage is an important part of helping to make that happen. It is an idea whose time has come.</p> </blockquote> <p>Miliband says that 11 Labour councils have already become living wage employers and that more are on the way to acquiring living wage status. In contrast, only one non-Labour authority is a living wage employer, and that's the GLA, where Boris Johnson inherited the policy from Ken Livingstone.</p> <p>Miliband says that, although David Cameron described the living wage as \"a good and attractive idea\" while in opposition, the Department for Business has recently said that the living wage \"does not consider any potential adverse employment effects\" and that it is \"unlikely to be a well-targeted poverty measure\".</p> <p>And he announces that Labour is considering three policy proposals that could be used to promote the living wage.</p> <p><strong>1. Forcing firms to pay the living wage if they want to bid for public sector contracts.</strong> Islington council did this when it awarded its ground maintenance contract to Enterprise, he says. All 80 Enterprise staff are now on the living wage, at a cost to the company of \u00a3150,000. Miliband says the company absorbed the entire cost, which was just a fraction of the value of the \u00a320m contract.</p> <p><strong>2. Paying firms a subsidy if they pay the living wage.</strong> Firms that pay the living wage save the taxpayer money because their employees do not require such high in-work benefits. Miliband says Labour is exploring ways of sharing this saving with employers, Here's an extract from his briefing paper.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The IFS estimated in a report two years ago that for every person moved on to the LW the saving for the Treasury would be around \u00a31,000.</p> <p>The Resolution Foundation and the IPPR are looking more closely at how you might could incentivise or support the spread of living wage by allowing employers to share in some of the savings that could be made in tax credits etc as a result of them paying living wage.</p> <p>This might involve councils and big employers adopting living wage <br> policies across a city or geographical area such as a Living Wage zone or getting some transitional support for policies that would help them make the transition - eg in return for investments in skills, or support for small businesses. It would see government, employers, and local authorities working together to develop One Nation solutions.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>3. Forcing firms to say how many of their employees are receiving less than the living wage.</strong> Miliband says that Labour has already called for more transparency in relation to pay at the top (it backs full disclosure of executive pay) and that this would be a natural extension of the transparency principle. In theory, it could \"shame\" employers into paying their staff more.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2012-11-05T13:24:44.053Z\">at 1.24pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-50978e5995cb1506d24448e0\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2012-11-05T10:01:40.093Z\">10.01am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>And here's the full list of accredited living wage employers.

Here's an extract.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The prime minister has already visited [the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia] since taking office and the fact that these are two of the few countries he is now returning to signals the PM's commitment to cementing long term partnerships with two of Britain\u2019s most important strategic allies in the Gulf. It follows a sustained government effort to build a reinvigorated partnership with countries in this region through the Gulf Initiative that was initiated in 2010 after a period of neglect.</p> <p>This strategic partnership is focused on delivering security, prosperity and openness in the region. A central pillar is our defence relationship with the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia given our shared commitment to security and stability and defeating the threats we face in the wider Middle East region.</p> <p>On this visit, the prime minister hopes to begin the next chapter in our relationship, establishing a truly strategic defence partnership. This presents an opportunity to significantly boost the British defence industry - worth \u00a35.4 billion in annual exports and sustaining 54,000 jobs \u2013 and the prime minister will use to the trip to specifically promote the Typhoon fast jet to Gulf leaders.</p> <p>The United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Oman have all expressed an interest in purchasing Typhoons and the Government is aiming to secure sales of over 100 aircraft to the region in the coming year, deals that together would be directly worth over \u00a36 billion to British firms with additional benefits through supply chain work.</p> <p>Oman is already in negotiations with BAE Systems for 12 fast jets with the contract due to be signed before the end of the year. And the Saudis have signalled that they are interested in placing a second substantial order, on top of the 72 jets they have already acquired.</p> <p>On the back of this success, the government is now encouraging the United Arab Emirates to choose Typhoon as they seek to replace their current fleet of French Mirage jets. The Emiratis have shown interest in placing an order for up to 60 jets and the prime minister will fly straight into a military airbase near Dubai where he will accompany the deputy chief of staff the UAE Armed Forces and the Emirati minister of state for foreign affairs to inspect the Typhoons with RAF pilots on hand to share their experiences of flying one of the best fast jets in the world. The government is currently working with the companies involved in the construction of Typhoons to ensure that the fast jets are kitted out with the latest targeting technology to increase the prospect of boosting their export sales.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-7b337806-e019-43cd-8d13-a57333f50309\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/11/5/1352108053338/f745bdb1-6f1c-4f58-b6b4-9cc9739c9981-460.jpeg\" alt=\"David Cameron in Dubai\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Cameron looks on beside Sheikh Ahmed Bin Saeed Al-Maktoum, Chairman and chief executive of Emirates Airlines and Group, and president of Dubai's Civil Aviation Authority, during a visit to the Dubai metro.

  "<p>Tammy Baldwin, a Wisconsin Democrat who stands a good chance of being the first openly gay candidate elected to the Senate, has a story she likes to tell about the event that propelled her into politics.</p> <p>\"I remember graduating from college, being very interested in public service yet wondering what I could aspire to be,\" she said in an interview. \"It was that year [1984], when I graduated from college, that Geraldine Ferraro was nominated for vice-president, and I watched in my first efficiency apartment, a little one-room place. I choked up and I thought at that moment: I can do anything. I can aspire to anything.\"</p> <p>With Baldwin on the ballot, facing Republican Tommy Thompson, and votes in four states to legalise same-sex marriage, there is a strong chance this election day could deliver a similar moment.</p> <p>It is already galvanising the movement for LGBT rights, winning Baldwin's race national attention. Barack Obama was due to hold his second campaign rally with Baldwin in 48 hours on Monday morning.</p> <p>During a brief stop at a small campaign office in a working-class area of Milwaukee on Sunday, Baldwin was thronged by volunteers from the Victory Fund, which works to get LGBT candidates to elected office.</p> <p>They had travelled from as far as Florida, New York and California to volunteer for her campaign. Outside groups poured money into the race, allowing Baldwin to pulverise Thompson's record. Al Franken, the comedian and Senator, went canvassing door-to-door.</p> <p>Polls show the Senate race virtually tied between Baldwin and Thompson, a former governor who has towered over Wisconsin politics for a quarter of a century. Ad spending on both campaigns topped $65m, making Wisconsin one of the most expensive Senate races in the country.</p> <p>But Baldwin insists her sexual orientation is rarely a topic of conversation on the campaign trail. \"It almost never comes up,\" she said. \"It's been a race that has been flat out on economic issues.\"</p> <p>To a lesser extent, a win for Baldwin \u2013 an \"ultra-liberal in the words of her opponent \u2013 would also be a slap at Wisconsin's governor, Scott Walker, who broke up the unions and then saw off a Democratic recall vote last summer.</p> <p>Baldwin is a strong supporter of most of the policies the Tea Party activists despise.</p> <p>She supported and even wrote part of the healthcare bill \u2013 the section enabling children to remain on their parents' insurance until age 26. She voted for the climate change law in 2009, and wanted to deepen investment in renewable energy. She has had doubts about sanctions on Iran.</p> <p>Thompson on the other hand wants to repeal Obama's healthcare act, expand oil drilling, and adopt Paul Ryan's deficit plan.</p> <p>Baldwin, 50, who has represented the liberal college town of Madison in the House of Representatives for 14 years, has the low-key demeanour of a technocrat or chief executive, but she espouses the politics of a populist.</p> <p>On her tour of get out the vote operations, she skipped the rousing speech for private chats with volunteers.</p> <p>Her opponent, Tommy Thompson, has been out of politics for 12 years working as a healthcare lobbyist. He was elected to four terms as governor, and served as health secretary in the Bush administration.</p> <p>But Thompson remains an old-school politician who seems unable to exit a room until he has shaken every last hand. He spent his Sunday tailgating with football fans in Green Bay, and before hopping on his red \"proven reformer\" bus to three more campaign events \u2013 with eight young grandchildren in tow. \"It's going very well,\" Thompson told the Guardian. \"There is momentum with us and I don't think the polls have picked up on this all over the state.\"</p> <p>For the most part, Thompson has not tried to use sexual orientation in his campaign. In a speech at party headquarters at Fond du Lac, north of Milwaukee, he focused his remarks on Barack Obama, whom he likened to Jimmy Carter.</p> <p>But his campaign earlier sent out pictures on Twitter of Baldwin at a gay pride event. Thompson has also tried to brand his opponent as too extreme for Wisconsin.</p> <p>\"There are big differences between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney,\" Thompson told the crowd at Sheboygan. \"But there's an ocean between Tammy Baldwin and Tommy Thompson. She's so extreme that Nancy Pelosi turns to the left to talk to (Baldwin).\"</p> <p>Baldwin fought back with ads branding Thompson as an outsourcer of jobs and a lobbyist with no interest helping in the poor.</p> <p>Most people following the race think it will go down to the last votes \u2013 Baldwin herself is predicting a much tighter finish than the last two elections. But she still dared hope out loud that her own race could make history.</p> <p>If she wins, her presence would force the Senate to engage more fully with LGBT issues.</p> <p>\"If you are not in the room, the conversation is about you. If you are in the room, the conversation is with you. We never had an openly LGBT member of the US Senate, and even though there are strong pro-equality allies who serve there, it has always been a conversation about a group of people. So this changes everything,\" she said.</p> <p>It could also change the landscape far beyond Washington, Baldwin said.</p> <p>\"I think in particular for young LGBT youth, especially those that come out in hostile communities or less supportive families and are thinking: 'what about my future?'. They can wake up to a Tammy Baldwin victory on November 7 and feel the way I did when Geraldine Ferraro accepted the nomination.\"</p>",
  "<p>With anti-Americanism creeping back to the forefront of political rhetoric in Moscow, many in Russia slyly smiled when Romney this year called Russia \"our No 1 geopolitical foe\".</p> <p>Vladimir Putin, Russia's president, said the remark showed Romney was \"open and sincere\". He added: \"That Romney considers us enemy No 1 and apparently has bad feelings about Russia is a minus, but, considering that he expresses himself bluntly, openly and clearly, [this] means he is an open and sincere man, which is a plus</p> <p>\"We will be oriented toward pluses, not minuses. And I am actually very grateful to him for formulating his position in a straightforward manner.\"</p> <p>The statement harked back to Soviet times, when Russia's leaders preferred dealing with Republicans \u2013 who were seen as straight-talking, if tough \u2013 to Democrats, seen here as masking their anti-Russian stance behind talk of human and civil rights, viewed with suspicion inside Russia.</p> <p>Maria Lipman, an expert at the Moscow Carnegie Centre, said: \"Particularly after the expulsion of the USAid, Washington's international aid agency, the Kremlin is now too committed to a path of using its old cold war foe as a bogeyman to consolidate wavering domestic support. Anti-American rhetoric in Russia has gone too far to shift easily now.\"</p> <p>Nor has there been much effort from the US presidential candidates to address policy towards Russia except for cheap point scoring, she added, and the next occupant of the White House was unlikely to seek to introduce any significant changes.</p> <p>Romney even appears in private to be backpedalling on his \"number one geopolitical foe\" comment. He used his son, Matt Romney, to pass a placatory message to Putin last month during a business trip to Moscow, according to a recent report in the New York Times.</p> <p>Many Russians have little interest in the race going on in the US, remaining sceptical that it can influence their lives.</p> <p>In a suburban train heading into Moscow on Friday evening, there was widespread indifference. \"Honestly, I don't care,\" said Sergei Chernenko, a 23-year old barman, adding that the election's outcome was irrelevant.</p> <p>Irina Kaidina, an accountant, concurred. Her son lived in New York, she said, but she couldn't remember the name of Barack Obama's challenger.</p> <p>Assistant engineer Nikolai Kuprianov, 32, however, said he had been following the presidential campaign. \"Obama would, of course, be a better choice in terms of attitudes towards Russia but Americans have never loved Russia and they only want us for our natural resources,\" he said.</p> <p>Obama had made the \"reset\" in relations with Russia an early foreign policy priority, but with recent disagreements over Syria, plus Moscow's accusation that the US stands behind opposition protests against Putin, what was once hailed as a success is now seen as dead.</p> <p>Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said as much in an interview published this week: \"If we talk about the 'reset', it is clear that, using computer terminology, it cannot last forever. Otherwise it would not be a 'reset' but a program failure\".</p> <p>Among Russia's chief concerns are energy policy \u2013 Putin's ability to govern rests on a high oil price, analysts say \u2013 and US plans for missile defence in Europe, which it opposes but both candidates support.</p>",
  "<p>China's elite would normally be watching the election more closely. But with its own once-a-decade leadership transition beginning days after the US votes, it has other matters on its mind.</p> <p>For many in China, the election is of relatively limited interest. Some will follow results avidly, but others are only concerned about the impact on China.</p> <p>\"I like Obama's style. He is a very charming guy \u2026 Romney seems quite aggressive,\" said Beijing-based marketing researcher Ming Ming, adding: \"I'm more concerned about who will have better policy towards China.\"</p> <p>Zheng Jihua, an entrepreneur, said: \"I don't think it makes much difference whether it's Obama or Romney.\"</p> <p>Despite the tough-talking on tackling China during debates, he said: \"The economic connections [between the countries] matters more than political things. If they become president they will be more realistic.\"</p> <p>China is used to playing its part in US presidential races. \"It's an old story, China becoming a political card to play in US elections. This year, Romney and Obama seem to be playing it more heavily,\" an editorial in the populist state-run Global Times said last month.</p> <p>But Shi Yinhong, an expert on Sino-US relations at Renmin University, said most people were more concerned by issues such as tensions with Japan over disputed islands.</p> <p>\"For those who are paying attention, I guess they may feel both sides are not so nice towards China,\" he said. \"I think maybe in government and the foreign policy elites they feel the lesser evil is still Barack Obama because they're familiar with him.</p> <p>\"If you look at the campaign statements, Romney has been much more combative in terms of US economic rivalry.\"</p> <p>Shen Dingli, director of the Centre for American Studies at Fudan University, disagreed. He argued that while China did not officially have a preference - due to the country's doctrine of non-interference in other nations' domestic affairs - in reality it leant to Republicans.</p> <p>\"The Republicans are pro-development, pro-foreign trade, pro-efficiency, pro-capitalism,\" he said, and were unlikely to push hard for cuts to China's carbon emissions, while Democrats \"are pro-American poor people and want to protect jobs\".</p> <p>Shen added: \"People claim if Romney is in power, the next day he will tackle China for manipulating the currency. It's a joke. Romney will be China's best friend because he will not honour his threats.\"</p> <p>Experts say tough talk from US candidates is rarely matched by their action once in office. Even so, Shi warned that in general \"Sino-American rivalries have become more profound and sometimes more tense.\"</p>",
  "<p>Eve-of-poll voter surveys mostly point to a narrow US presidential election victory for Barack Obama. But with the contest finely balanced in a few key states, it would not take much to shift the advantage to Mitt Romney. A last-minute slip, a neglected minority voter bloc, or simply a piece of bad luck could be enough to ditch Obama and send the Republican to the White House.</p> <p>Here's one possible example: Obama's <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6ZHMsivjr04\" title=\"\">unguarded suggestion in Springfield, Ohio</a> last Friday that \"voting is the best revenge\" has been seized on by Republicans. Romney exploited it in a speech later that same day. \"He [Obama] asked his supporters to vote \u2013 to vote for revenge. Instead, I ask the American people to vote for love of country,\" Romney said \u2013 and then aired <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/04/mitt-romney-vote-for-revenge-rumpus\" title=\"\">a TV attack ad</a> featuring the exchange.</p> <p>\"'Revenge' is not something sought by most American voters, and 2008 Obama voters who are disappointed in his performance \u2026 Voters want someone who will serve the country. The moment when Obama said \"revenge\" could turn out to be a pivotal moment in the campaign\", said Beltway Confidential commentator <a href=\"http://washingtonexaminer.com/the-problem-with-obamas-revenge/article/2512567#.UJea4I7cLH1\" title=\"\">Michael Barone</a>. Obama faces plenty of other possible last-minute pitfalls as he reaches for the finishing line.</p> <h2><strong>The Bradley effect</strong></h2> <p>Named after a former <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley_effect\" title=\"\">black mayor of Los Angeles</a>, this phenomenon involves voters telling pollsters they intend to support a black candidate, and then not doing so because of his or her ethnicity. In 2008 Obama enjoyed an 8-9% lead in most polls, but his actual margin of victory was 6%. If today's polls are overestimating his backing by a similar margin, <a href=\"http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/11/03/reporting-that-makes-you-stupid/\" title=\"\">Romney will win</a>.</p> <p>Racial prejudice, covert or otherwise, also partly explains why a majority of white males will vote against Obama. In 2008, 57% backed Republican John McCain. The anti-Obama totals among both white men and women may be higher this time, polls suggest. It is also a fact that <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/10/11/us-usa-campaign-whites-idUSBRE89A07C20121011\" title=\"\">white males prefer Republicans to Democrats</a>, whatever their colour.</p> <h2><strong>Turnout</strong></h2> <p>The Democrats need a big turnout to secure victory but most estimates suggest Obama's support, particularly among younger voters, blacks and Hispanics, will fall well below 2008 levels, partly as a result of disappointment with his performance in office.</p> <p>\"In 2008, voters 18 to 29 went for Obama 2-1 over McCain; turnout among these young voters was the second-largest ever recorded. But in 2012, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/why-young-voters-arent-feeling-obama-mania-this-time/2012/11/02/e9a97024-1c5a-11e2-9cd5-b55c38388962_story.html?wprss=rss_opinions\" title=\"\">that youthful Obamamania seems to have faded</a>. Alex Wirth of the Harvard Public Opinion Project has forecast that turnout for voters under 30 will be 34 to 40%, compared with 51% four years ago,\" said Fast Company's Anya Kamenetz.</p> <h2><strong>Swingers</strong></h2> <p>At the heart of American pollsters' electoral map lies an awkward little secret. Presidential elections are increasingly decided by an ever-smaller group of swing voters within an ever-smaller number of swing states. Nobody really knows exactly who or where these people are, and that makes for severe unpredictability. But Republicans are claiming independent voters (neither Republican nor Democrat registered) are breaking 2-1 for Romney in toss-up states and that early voting turnout shows the <a href=\"http://washingtonexaminer.com/sunday-reflection-the-ground-glass-election/article/2512449#.UJemFY7cLH1\" title=\"\">Republican base is more energised</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Acts of God</strong></h2> <p>Religiously-inclined voters could also give Obama a scare. \"I expect Mitt Romney to maximise the white religious vote \u2026 The major push Obama made in 2008 among white Catholics is completely absent this cycle \u2026 Anti-Mormon sentiment has never caught on among the Christian community to the degree some feared. And Obama's contraception and abortion message has caused a great deal of concern among religious groups, Protestant and Catholic alike,\" said <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2012/11/03/obamas_failure_with_whites_independents_will_sink_him.html\" title=\"\">analyst Ben Domenech</a>.</p> <h2><strong>Perfect storm</strong></h2> <p>Despite suspicions about Hurricane Sandy, Obama does not control the weather. Forecasters say election day will be <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/features/20189531\" title=\"\">cold, wet and windy in the north and east</a> \u2013 not good for the needed high Democrat turnout.</p> <h2><strong>Cock-up or conspiracy?</strong></h2> <p>Comparisons are already being made with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/jun/06/uselections2000.usa\" title=\"\">2000 presidential election</a> that saw George Bush installed as president after numerous recounts, legal challenges, and myriad balloting irregularities gave rise to <a href=\"http://www.michaelparenti.org/stolenelections.html\" title=\"\">claims of widespread fraud and rigging</a>. Today's election is supposed to be better organised. But Americans are a sceptical lot. If the vote is as close as predicted, and the result is not immediately clear, claims that sinister forces are at work will not be long in coming.</p>",
  "<p>On the eve of the 2008 US primary campaign, I wrote an Observer piece about \"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2007/dec/30/politics\" title=\"\">the most open, volatile (and exciting) race [for Republicans and Democrats] in years</a>\".</p> <p>Republicans were split between Romney, Giuliani and the maverick outsider, John McCain. Democrats had a choice between Hillary Clinton, John Edwards and the more or less unknown Barack Obama. For both parties, the race was so close that, as I put it, \"even a book could make a difference\".</p> <p>So I sat down and read \u2013 well, skimmed \u2013 14 campaign memoirs. It was not an uplifting experience. </p> <p>What, you might ask, did you think? Indeed, what do books have to do with politics? The interesting thing is that, in the US, quite a bit. Almost all presidential contenders publish some autobiography or other, to tell their \"personal story\".</p> <p>Some 13 of these titles, many of them ghosted, made grim reading, a horrible mixture of posturing, tubthumping and outright mendacity. Even Clinton's Living History was a big disappointment.</p> <p>But there was an exception. The unknown Barack Obama was the author of not one, but two, bestselling titles: Dreams from My Father (1995) and The Audacity of Hope (2006). I described the former as \"fearless, moving, and beautifully written\", and the latter as possessing \"authenticity and freshness\", even though it had obviously been put together in a hurry for the campaign.</p> <p>About Obama's writing, I wrote he had a gift for language \"equal to Jefferson, Kennedy and, yes, Lincoln\". That was too much, of course \u2013 in those heady days, hyperbole and Obama went together like ham and eggs \u2013 but I'm not ashamed to recall that I tipped Obama as one who \"may yet be in their company\". Perhaps, I said in the New Year of 2008, \"the American people will decide that Barack Obama should be the next resident of the White House\".</p> <p>A year later, he was.</p> <p>Obama campaigned in poetry, and gave the American people both a vision and a narrative. But he governed in prose and, despite some notable achievements, failed to find a presidential language to equal his campaigning rhetoric. Obama's words of hope \u2013 \"<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe751kMBwms\" title=\"\">Yes, We Can</a>\" \u2013 were simple and uplifting, universally intelligible and plugged into the American Dream. He moved people to tears, but only as a candidate. As president, the tears have been of frustration.</p> <p>Obama's Rose Garden comments and his presidential-bully pulpit speeches have occasionally soared \u2013 for example, <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jan/13/obama-tucson-speech-pastor-politician\" title=\"\">after the assassination attempt on Arizona congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords</a>. In general, however, Obama has not managed, or perhaps not bothered, to sell his presidency in the way he sold his campaign \u2013 on a thermal of uplifting prose. Possibly, the reality of power was too complex, or too absorbing, to be reduced to the kind of narrative that plays well to the American people. That was Bill Clinton's gift. Obama did not master it.</p> <p>For four years, then, Obama the writer became lost in the travails of Obama the Democrat politician. His absolute low point, rhetorically speaking, was the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/video/2012/oct/04/first-presidential-debate-video-highlights\" title=\"\">Denver debate</a> in which he appeared bored, listless, irritated and unfocused. It was almost as if he knew that campaign poetry was a blind alley he would not go down again.</p> <p>But his gifts as a writer and a speaker remain. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/oct/31/obama-new-jersey-sandy-victims\" title=\"\">His response to superstorm Sandy</a> shows he can still rise to the occasion, with thrilling language. That, I think, is why Europeans especially cherish him. I am probably not alone in wondering what his presidential memoirs will be like, when the time comes to put pen to paper.</p> <p>Today, thankfully, it looks as if that moment is still four years away. On the eve of <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/nov/04/obama-romney-campaign-desperation\" title=\"\">his probable re-election</a>, as one of his English admirers, who has not had to live in the poisoned atmosphere of Tea Party America, I hope that, in a second term, in the service of \"common hopes and common dreams\", he will remind us that literature and politics can become bipartisan allies, not bitter adversaries. Yes, it would be nice to see a bit of poetry in the president's second term. It would be nice if Obama would devote some time to giving some rhetorical uplift to the gritty business of everyday life.</p>",

The scores were derived by measuring 39 softer, more human perceptions of how voters feel \"brand Obama\" and \"brand Romney\" can improve their lives from both community and personal perspectives. In particular, this methodology shows how voters feel each candidate is placed to deliver meaningful messages as the impact of superstorm Sandy inevitably shifts the campaign focus back on to communities, the environment and the people within it.</p> <p>The analysis revealed that although two-thirds of voters believe Barack Obama will win the election, voter fatigue set in immediately following each of the four presidential debates. Viewing figures and overall faith in either candidate's ability to improve quality of lives fell. Overall, Obama continues to hold the lead across all 39 meaningful metrics after the final debate, but before superstorm Sandy hit his numbers were softening. Mitt Romney's numbers were showing some signs of life, especially as he either led or was close to Obama on the two metrics that voters cared most about: promoting business and creating jobs and confidence in the country.</p> <p>However, in the wake of superstorm Sandy and focus shifting towards communities and the environment, Obama's figures start to show considerable strength. On both personal and collective issues, Obama is much stronger in all areas associated with the community, the environment and safety.</p> <p>How each candidate is placed on key issues in the aftermath of superstorm Sandy: 1. \"Listens to and cares about people\" \u2013 Obama's scores are double those of Romney throughout the four recent tracking periods. His scores are on average at 45% compared with scores in the low 20s percentile for Romney</p> <p><strong>2.</strong> \"Is truly interested in and committed to solving environmental issues\" \u2013 Obama's scores overshadow Romney's at an average of 38% over the last four weeks compared to those of Romney's which are languishing in the early teens.</p> <p><strong>3.</strong> \"Is taking a lead on environmental issues\": \u2013 again Romney lags way behind, ending the month just two points up at 13% compared to Obama's 39%.</p> <p><strong>4.</strong> \"Helps voters feel part of a community\": \u2013 Obama leads again by more than double each week, yet the figures are still low for both \u2013 26% for Obama compared to 12% for Romney.</p> <p><strong>5.</strong> \"Fosters community development\" \u2013 Obama scores started at 28% and ended on 32%, while Romney started at 15% and ended on 19%.</p> <p><strong>6.</strong> \"Helps voters protect the environment\" \u2013 Obama more than doubles Romney's score, although both are low. Obama ending at 23% and Romney at just 10%.</p> <p><strong>7.</strong> \"Makes people feel safer from threats and harm\" \u2013 Obama started a month ago at 26% and ended at 29%, while Romney started and finished at 19%.</p> <p>Hernan Sanchez, CEO of Havas Media Intelligence comments: \"While we don't doubt that both candidates are genuine in their repositioning towards the communities which have been hit, it's interesting to see how credible, meaningful and believable their actions will be in these crucial days before the election. We see from these results just how solid Obama's footage is on these issues. At the same time however, should the relief effort fail, he has more to lose.\"</p> <p>Umair Haque, director of Havas Media Labs adds: \"Hurricane Sandy is a dramatic example of why people across the globe are beginning to look to their leaders and institutions not just for more, bigger, faster, cheaper \u2013 but meaningfully better; for lives that are meaningfully well lived. And you can't live meaningfully well if there's a superstorm blowing down your door. Throughout our election research, American voters have delivered one single message: while elections are contests between two imperfect candidates, neither candidate is seen to be living up to their expectations of taking on the challenges that matter most, whether rebuilding the real economy, education, healthcare, transport, or infrastructure \u2013 or, of course, protecting the environment. This great political meaning gap \u2013 the gap between what people want from leaders, and what leaders give to people \u2013 is why the relationship between politics and people is broken and America. And the great challenge for today's leaders isn't winning an election, but fixing this broken relationship, by getting serious about what matters: the promise of meaningfully better lives.\"</p> <p><em>By the Havas </em><a href=\"http://www.havasmedia.com/our-thinking/meaningfulbrands/\" title=\"\"><em>Meaningful Brands</em></a><em> team</em></p> <p><strong>To get more articles like this sent direct to your inbox, </strong><a href=\"https://register.guardian.co.uk/media/\" title=\"\"><strong>sign up for free membership</strong></a><strong> of the Guardian Media Network.

  "<p>Monsanto and other agribusiness and food companies <a href=\"http://votersedge.org/california/ballot-measures/2012/november/prop-37/funding\" title=\"\">have spent more than $45m (\u00a328m) to defeat a California ballot measure</a> that would require labelling of some GM foods.</p> <p>The measure, <a href=\"http://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/propositions/37/\" title=\"\">proposition 37</a>, is one of the most contentious initiatives on California's election ballot on Tuesday.</p> <p>If it passes, it would require labels on GM food sold in supermarkets, but would not cover restaurants. It also has a number of gaping loopholes. For example, the law would not require labels on meat from animals that were fed GM corn.</p> <p>Even with those caveats, the agribusiness and food companies have outspent the yes side by about five to one trying to kill the bill. Monsanto alone has spent more than $8m.</p> <p>\"I think it's a David and Goliath story with the companies that manufacture or benefit from genetically engineered food being the Goliath,\" said David Newman, president of Maplight, which tracks the influence of money in politics.</p> <p>\"When you see this lopsided spending it indicates that the measure is popular with voters and opponents think they need to spend a lot to defeat it. There is a lot at stake here not just in California but how it will trend in the rest of the country.\"</p> <p>California's ballot initiatives often take on huge importance. Often they are seen as laboratories for new ideas, that are adopted later in the rest of the country.</p> <p>The bill is mainly supported by organic food companies, although the actor Gwyneth Paltrow also contributed $15,000, according to campaigners.</p> <p>Supporters argue the consumers have a right to know if they are eating GM foods. Opponents \u2013 overwhelmingly corporations such as Monsanto, Dupont, Pepsico and Nestle \u2013 say the labels would be burdensome to retailers, and would force prices to rise.</p> <p>Others support the idea of labels in general but argue that this particular initiative is poorly written.</p> <p>A label requirement could have a sweeping effect on the American foods industry. About 90% of American-grown corn and soybean are GM. Other large crops, such as canola and sugar beet, also tend to be GM.</p>",
  "<p>John Cusack is being lined up to <a href=\"http://www.deadline.com/2012/11/john-cusack-contemplating-rush-limbaugh-film/\" title=\"\">play the controversial US conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh</a> in a new biopic, according to Deadline.</p> <p>Though it is said to be in the early stages, Betty Thomas's film would centre on the rightwing radio host's three-decade rise to prominence. Limbaugh's syndicated show is the highest rated in the country with a weekly audience of 15 million listeners.</p> <p>Thomas previously brought the biopic <a href=\"http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0119951/\" title=\"\">Private Parts</a> \u2013 about the \"shock jock\" Howard Stern \u2013 to cinemas, in which the latter starred as himself. The as-yet-untitled Limbaugh biopic is said to be a non-partisan take, though Cusack is known for his liberal leanings. \"The script would explore the rise and reinvention of American talk radio, and Limbaugh's continued influence and impact over the last three decades in that world,\" said a spokesman for production company True Crimes Productions. Cusack is also set to take a producer's role.</p> <p>Limbaugh recently accused Batman film <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/141046/dark-knight-rises\" title=\"\">The Dark Knight Rises</a> of utilising a villain named Bane <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jul/18/dark-knight-rises-bane-mitt-romney\" title=\"\">in order to damage Republican US presidential candidate Mitt Romney</a>, who at the time was at the centre of a row over his involvement in the investment company Bain Capital in the 1980s. The radio host's controversial proclamations include claiming that African Americans are \"left behind\" socially because they have been trained to hate the US, insisting that feminism was established so as to allow unattractive women easier access to mainstream society and criticising those who attacked US soldiers caught up in the Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse scandal for \"ruining people's lives\" and \"hampering our military effort\".</p> <p>Former Hill Street Blues actor Thomas's other films include 1995's <a href=\"http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0112572/\" title=\"\">The Brady Bunch Movie</a> and the 1998 Eddie Murphy vehicle <a href=\"http://uk.imdb.com/title/tt0118998/\" title=\"\">Dr Dolittle</a>.</p>",
  "<p>The Financial Times has thrown its weight behind a second term in the White House for Barack Obama, <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f11742fa-2501-11e2-8924-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2BHaUclbb\" title=\"\">endorsing the incumbent</a> as \"the better choice\" for a country still struggling to recover from the economic crisis.</p> <p>While bemoaning a lacklustre campaign in which both candidates displayed \"a poverty of ambition\", the British newspaper on Monday cited the president's handling of the recent east coast storm as an illustration of why he, rather than Mitt Romney, deserved Americans' votes.</p> <p>\"As in his response to hurricane Sandy, Mr Obama has shown that purposeful government can be part of the solution rather than the problem,\" it remarked. \"Four years on from the financial crisis, with extreme inequality an affront to the American dream, there remains a need for intelligent, reformist governance. Mr Obama, his presidency defined by the economic crisis, looks the better choice.\"</p> <p>But the endorsement, which comes soon after similar backing from the London-based current affairs magazine the Economist, was far from ringing. While documenting some of the high points of Obama's first term \u2013 including healthcare reform, for instance, and a $787bn (\u00a3490bn) stimulus package \"that saved the country from another Great Depression\" \u2013 the FT also detailed several weaknesses, such as his \"notably cool\" stance on business. \"The self-proclaimed agent of change,\" it said, \"has at crucial points failed to exercise leadership.\"</p> <p>But the FT shows little ambivalence towards Obama's opponent. While commenting that Romney appears \"a man comfortable with exercising executive power\", it noted a \"needlessly belligerent\" foreign policy and, more importantly, it said, an economic strategy that raised as many questions as it answered.</p> <p>\"[Romney] \u2026 has gone through so many contortions to win his party's nomination that it is hard to see how he would govern in practice. His wishlist includes an aspiration to raise Pentagon spending by a fifth while cutting everyone's taxes and still somehow balancing the books. Such fiscal alchemy is an exercise in evasion, not a recipe for sustainable economic recovery.\"</p> <h2>What the papers say</h2> <p><strong>The Economist (for Obama)</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21565623-america-could-do-better-barack-obama-sadly-mitt-romney-does-not-fit-bill-which-one\" title=\"\">\"A man who once personified hope and centrism</a> set a new low by unleashing attacks on Mitt Romney even before the first Republican primary. Yet elections are about choosing somebody to run a country. And this choice turns on two questions: how good a president has Mr Obama been, especially on the main issues of the economy and foreign policy? And can America really trust the ever-changing Mitt Romney to do a better job? On that basis, the Democrat narrowly deserves to be re-elected \u2026 For all his businesslike intentions, Mr Romney has an economic plan that works only if you don't believe most of what he says. That is not a convincing pitch for a chief executive. And for all his shortcomings, Mr Obama has dragged America's economy back from the brink of disaster, and has made a decent fist of foreign policy.

He has formed sensible budget policies that are not dedicated to protecting the powerful, and has worked to save the social safety net to protect the powerless. Mr Obama has impressive achievements despite the implacable wall of refusal erected by congressional Republicans so intent on stopping him that they risked pushing the nation into depression, held its credit rating hostage, and hobbled economic recovery. Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, has gotten this far with a guile that allows him to say whatever he thinks an audience wants to hear. But he has tied himself to the ultraconservative forces that control the Republican party and embraced their policies, including reckless budget cuts and 30-year-old, discredited trickle-down ideas. Voters may still be confused about Mr Romney's true identity, but they know the Republican party, and a Romney administration would reflect its agenda. Mr Romney's choice of Paul Ryan as his running mate says volumes about that.\"</p> <p><strong>The Los Angeles Times (for Obama)</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/endorsements/la-ed-end-president-20121021,0,5490210.story\" title=\"\">\"The most troubling aspect of Romney's candidacy</a> is that we still don't know what his principles are. Is he the relatively moderate Republican who was governor of Massachusetts, the \"severely conservative\" one on display in the GOP primaries or the more reasonable-sounding fellow who reappeared at the presidential debates? His modulating positions on his own tax plan, healthcare reform, financial regulation, Medicare, immigration and the national safety net add to the impression that the only thing he really stands for is his own election. Voters face a momentous choice in November between two candidates offering sharply different prescriptions for what ails the country. Obama's recalls the successful formula of the 1990s, when the government raised taxes and slowed spending to close the deficit. The alternative offered by Romney would neglect the country's infrastructure and human resources for the sake of yet another tax cut and a larger defence budget than even the Pentagon is seeking.

Which candidate could forge the compromises in Congress to achieve these goals? When the question is framed in those terms, Mitt Romney emerges the stronger candidate \u2026 Barack Obama rocketed to the presidency from relative obscurity with a theme of hope and change. A different reality has marked his presidency. His record on the economy in the past four years does not suggest he would lead in the direction the nation must go in the next four years. Voters should give Mitt Romney a chance to correct the nation's fiscal course and to implode the partisan gridlock that has shackled Washington and the rest of America \u2013 with the understanding that he would face the same assessment in four years if he does not succeed.\"</p> <p><strong>The Houston Chronicle \u2013 the biggest daily newspaper in Texas (for Romney)</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.chron.com/opinion/editorials/article/Romney-for-president-3965675.php\" title=\"\">\"President Obama's deeds have failed to match his words,</a> much less his specific vows to cut the national debt by half and bring the nation's unemployment rate to 6%.

The hurtful symbol of this attitude of insensitivity to Texans' feelings was the administration's choice to deny Space City's bid to become home to one of the retired space shuttles. We do not believe four more years on the same plodding course toward economic recovery is the best path forward for Texas or the nation. And so we endorse the Republican team, Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan, in the belief that they can do better by Texas and the nation.\"</p>",
  "<p>Israel's prime minister and defence minister ordered the country's military to prepare for a strike against Iran's nuclear installations two years ago, according to a television documentary.</p> <p>But the order was not carried out after it met with strong opposition from two key security figures, the military chief of staff and head of the Mossad, claimed Uvda (Fact), broadcast yesterday.</p> <p>It said that at the end of a meeting of selected ministers and officials Binyamin Netanyahu and Ehud Barak ordered the army to raise its level of preparedness to P Plus, a code signifying imminent military action.</p> <p>But the army chief, Gabi Ashkenazi and the Mossad head, Meir Dagan, who were at the meeting, opposed the move. According to the hour-long Channel 2 programme, Dagan told Netanyahu and Barak: \"You are likely to make an illegal decision to go to war. Only the cabinet is authorised to decide this.\" The programme reported Dagan saying after the meeting that the prime minister and defence minister were \"simply trying to steal a war\".</p> <p>Ashkenazi voiced fears that raising the alert level would \"create facts on the ground\", making a military strike inevitable. He was quoted as saying: \"This is not something you do unless you are certain you want to execute at the end.\"</p> <p>Both security chiefs have since left their posts.</p> <p>Barak, who was interviewed for the programme, said the order was not carried out because the military did not have the necessary operational capability. He rejected the notion that security chiefs vetoed the order.</p> <p>\"The things you are describing are the responsibility of the government,\" he said. \"The idea that if the chief of staff does not recommend something that is possible to do, then we cannot decide to carry it out \u2013 this has no basis in fact. The chief of staff must build the operational capacity, he must tell us from a professional point of view whether it is possible to carry out an order, or if it is not possible, and he also can \u2013 and must \u2013 give his recommendation. [But] it can be carried out against his recommendation.\"</p> <p>Barak also said that raising the alert level \"did not necessarily mean war\".</p> <p>The reporter for the programme, Ilana Dayan, said Israeli military censors prevented her from disclosing the date in 2010 for the order.</p> <p>Since leaving office, both former security chiefs have made clear their opposition to premature military action against Iran's nuclear programme. In August, Ashkenazi said \"we're still not there\", urging more time for sanctions and diplomacy.</p> <p>Dagan said bombing Iran was \"<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/9677363\" title=\"\">the stupidest idea I've ever heard</a>\". He told CBS's 60 Minutes: \"An attack on Iran now before exploring all other approaches is not the right way \u2026 to do it.\"</p> <p>The current senior echelon of Israel's military and intelligence establishment in Israel is also believed to have serious reservations about launching unilateral military action. The US has urged restraint, arguing that sanctions need time to take effect.</p> <p>In his speech to the United Nations in September, Netanyahu pulled back from the likelihood of an imminent Israeli strike when he declared that a \"red line\" \u2013 the point at which Iran is close to nuclear capability \u2013 would not be crossed until next spring or summer. The Iranians say their nuclear programme is for domestic use, not to create weapons.</p> <p>Scott Johnson, a senior analyst with IHS Jane's, said that Israel still faces the same capability issues as two years ago. \"The capability issues that prevent them from performing a unilateral strike are the same now as they were in 2010,\" he said, citing the lack of air-to-air refuellers and heavy-duty bombs needed to penetrate underground bunkers. \"They can plan and prepare for a unilateral strike as much as they want, but they can't actually do it without the US.\"</p> <p>The timing of the broadcast, two months before a general election in Israel, could be significant, said Meir Javedanfar, an Iranian-born Israeli analyst. \"If Netanyahu and Barak are shown as too eager to go to war without considering opinion inside the cabinet and security establishment, that makes them look reckless. The fact that the [Israeli] military censors allowed the programme to be aired could mean that they are trying to show it was the military establishment that basically saved Israel from possible disaster.\"</p> <p>Channel 2's disclosures came as a respected Israeli thinktank, the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS), published the outcome of a <a href=\"http://www.inss.org.il/publications.php?cat=21&amp;incat=&amp;read=10461\" title=\"\">war game simulating the 48-hour period after an Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear installations</a>. In the scenario, Israel does not inform the US of its operation until after its launch. Iran reacts by launching around 200 missiles at Israel, and urging its proxies Hezbollah and Hamas to do likewise. However, it is careful to avoid attacking US targets in the immediate aftermath of a strike.</p> <p>According to the INSS, there are two opposing outcomes of an Israeli attack: \"One anticipates the outbreak of world war three, while the other envisions containment and restraint, and presumes that in practice Iran's capabilities to ignite the Middle East are limited.\" Its war game \"developed in the direction of containment and restraint\".</p>",
  "<p>With leading shares weaker after signs of a slowdown in China and ahead of the US election, <strong>Weir</strong> was an exception.</p> <p>The pumps and valves maker has jumped 55p to \u00a318.06, a 3% increase which makes it the biggest riser in a falling FTSE 100, following a positive update. The company said it expected to report full year profits of \u00a3440m to \u00a3450m, in line with market forecasts, despite global uncertainty and mixed markets.</p> <p>Third quarter revenue and profits saw a slowdown because of a lower order book, but were ahead of last year's figures thanks to the benefit of recent acquisitions. The value of orders received in the quarter fell by 15%, mainly due to declines in the US and Canadian oil and gas sector. In its mineral division, whose largest exposures are to copper and gold, it said revenues were likely to be below its guidance in July. Chris Dyett at Investec said:</p> <blockquote> A solid update, slightly ahead of our expectations, with only modest evidence for a bear attack on minerals growth rates which were always going to slow. Oil and gas has upside in the medium term as the US gas price recovers to a level when US horizontal drilling will begin adding back gas rigs after the rapid switch to liquids/shale oil seen in the first half of 2012. We expect to upgrade 2012 pretax profits by around 2% and place our target price under review, but retain our buy. <br> </blockquote> <p>Overall the <strong>FTSE 100</strong> has fallen 35.26 points to 5833.29, with miners among the weaker performers after lower than expected service sector figures from China - a key consumer of commodities. <strong>Vedanta Resources</strong> is down 26p to \u00a311.34 - not helped by a downgrade from Citigroup - while <strong>Antofagasta</strong> has fallen 24p to \u00a312.91.</p> <p><strong>HSBC</strong> has lost 13p to 613.1p following its figures, while <strong>Lloyds Banking Group</strong> is 0.755p lower at 42.67p despite weekend reports it was considering a sale of its 60% stake in wealth manager <strong>St James Place</strong>, down 9.6p to 388.9p. Gary Greenwood at Shore Capital said:</p> <blockquote> At the current share price, Lloyds stake is worth around \u00a31.2bn, albeit we think the shares are currently undervalued by the market, so a sale at this price would not maximise value for Lloyds' shareholders. <br> Instead, we believe the rationale behind a sale is that it would be beneficial to capital as bank investments in other financial institutions will be treated less favourably under the incoming Basel 3 capital framework. Selling the stake would therefore help in closing the 'fully loaded' Basel 3 core tier 1 capital deficit that we estimate will be around circa \u00a37.7bn at the end December 2012.  Such a decision could also revive questions about whether Lloyds will look to sell the rest of its insurance operations, which largely comprise of Scottish Widows and Clerical Medical, both wholly owned subsidiaries. However, a sale or IPO of these operations in the current market environment could prove to be challenging, in our view. </blockquote>",
  "<p>Scientists may be reluctant to link <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/hurricane-sandy\" title=\"\">Hurricane Sandy</a> with climate change, but extreme events could be the tipping point that wakes America up to the seriousness of global warming, according to Tom Steyer, probably the richest climate change champion in the US, and arguably the most effective.</p> <p>\"The connection between extreme weather events and climate change is like that between steroids and home runs: you can't tie any one home run to steroid usage, but the number and distance sure increase,\" he said.</p> <p>Whether Hurricane Sandy is enough to trigger change in public pressure and political action on climate change remains to be seen, but the hedge fund manager has previously compared America's inaction on climate change to those who buried their heads in the sand in 1938 when they knew something awful was happening in Europe.</p> <p>\"I believe that there will be some event that changes the way we think about this,\" he said at a Hamilton Group forum at Stanford University earlier this year.</p> <p>Steyer founded <a href=\"http://www.faralloncapital.com/\" title=\"\">Farallon Capital</a> in 1986, which now has $20 billion under management. Steyer's own personal fortune valued at $1.3bn puts him firmly in the bracket of America's 1% richest people. San Francisco-based Farallon Capital doesn't focus on sustainable investments and like many hedge funds, its asset management strategy is murky. Unlike many hedge fund managers though, Steyer is extremely outspoken and has ploughed a great deal of his own fortune into social and environmental causes.</p> <p>In 2010, Steyer fronted $5m to fund the campaign to defeat <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/nov/03/prop-23-climate-california\" title=\"\">Prop 23</a>, an aggressive ballot measure put forward by California's oil refiners which would have left the state's climate change AB32 legislation in tatters.</p> <p>\"My support for Prop 23 was considered a stupid thing to do and a foolish waste of time and money. In struggles at the polls between oil companies and environmentalists, traditionally the thinking was that environmentalists were poor and stupider, and less ruthless.\"</p> <p>Many investors and business leaders would be reluctant to take a political stand over such a high-octane issue for fear it would hurt their company, but the campaign defeated the measure, also partly thanks to high-profile support from Robert Redford, Bill Gates and Leonardo Di Caprio.</p> <p>In this election, Steyer has spent $21.9m on a ballot initiative when California goes to the polls on 6 November. <a href=\"http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/California_Proposition_39,_Income_Tax_Increase_for_Multistate_Businesses_%282012%29\" title=\"\">Prop 39</a> aims to close a corporate tax loophole worth $1bn a year, money that Steyer believes could be re-appropriated for alternative energy investments.</p> <p>\"I am committed to trying to get stuff done in the areas where I am passionate, one of them is energy,\" he said. \"I don't expect to stop working in energy and I want California to be well governed.\"</p> <p>Steyer added again to his pugnacious reputation by launching an all-out attack on Mitt Romney at the Democratic National Convention. Romney's energy plan, largely dependent on oil sands from Canada, is \"mindblowing\", he said.</p> <p>\"Mitt Romney and I share the same income bracket,\" he told delegates in Charlotte, North Carolina. \"[But] Romney and I don't share the same vision for the future, especially when it comes to energy.</p> <p>\"Romney would do nothing to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and much to increase it. He would gut President Obama's investments in clean energy. He wants to keep giving four billion taxpayer dollars to oil companies every year \u2013 the very same oil companies pouring millions into the outside groups backing his campaign.\"</p> <p>Often described as a bulwark against the corporate carbon heavyweights such as the <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/koch-brothers\" title=\"\">Koch brothers</a> in the US, Steyer has had to increase his political clout since the Supreme Court ruled in 2010 that corporations could give unlimited donations to campaign. Koch-affiliated groups are estimated to have spent $400m on Romney's campaign.</p> <p>\"I disagree with many of the things that the Koch brothers have done,\" he said. \"There's definitely concern in the US about the ability of corporations to effect the policy especially in light of the Supreme Court ruling. That was one which enables purely economic thinking to have a disproportionate impact.\"</p> <p>\"I have gotten myself convinced that this is an area that is important and where there is a vacuum in terms of pushing for what I think are important changes. I've been compelled to fill the vacuum ... I am really intent on making a difference in areas where I think we're off the rails,\" he said.</p> <p>Despite his involvement in politics so far, including fundraising for Barack Obama, Steyer said that he remains \"agnostic\" about taking office himself or the 'climate champion' mantle as former Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger had done.</p> <p>Large chunks of his wealth have also been spent on academic institutes, including the establishment of the <a href=\"http://www.tcng.org/\" title=\"\">Center for the Next Generation</a>, a non-profit dealing with children's issues and the environment run by his brother James. In 2009, he and his wife, Kat Taylor, helped establish the <a href=\"http://tomkat.stanford.edu/\" title=\"\">TomKat Centre for Sustainable Energy</a> at Stanford University.</p> <p>\"I was just trying to help them get the resources to apply their incredible capability to what I think is going to be the biggest problem in the world. The opposite of living in a sustainable world is living in an unsustainable world. That seems to me to be an overwhelming problem.\"</p> <p>In 2010, Steyer and his wife signed the <a href=\"http://givingpledge.org/\" title=\"\">Giving Pledge</a> started by Bill Gates and Warren Buffet to encourage American billionaires to give half their fortune to charity.</p> <p>\"Even the richest Americans have a responsibility to their society and their fellow citizens. We are all tied to each other's success or failure. We are one society that will rise and fall together. It's not an atomised group of people in a Darwinian struggle.

  "<h2>Israel and the Palestinians</h2> <p>Two weeks ago, Randi Mellman Oze, 54, printed off her absentee ballot paper, marked a cross next to Mitt Romney's name, sealed the envelope and took it to the post office to send it back to the US.</p> <p>A lifelong Democrat voter until she came to live in Israel five years ago, changing her political stance had been \"a very big deal\" to her.</p> <p>\"I was always a Democrat, and my family are all Democrats. But I don't feel Obama has Israel's best interests at heart,\" she said. \"Instead of concentrating on sanctions against Iran in the first two years of his presidency, he made nice to them and he put pressure on Israel. If he hadn't followed this policy, we would not now be on the brink of war with Iran.\"</p> <p>She is among up to 250,000 American-Israelis entitled to vote in Tuesday's US presidential election, the majority of whom are believed to be backing the Republican candidate.</p> <p>Polls of all Israelis, not just immigrants from the US, have shown a majority in favour of ousting Obama and installing Romney in the White House.</p> <p>The Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, is widely perceived to be rooting for a Romney victory, against all protocol. Many commentators have accused him of interfering in internal US politics in his eagerness to see an ideological soulmate in the White House.</p> <p>Relations between Obama and Netanyahu have been severely strained by the Israeli leader's insistence on a tougher US stance on the Iranian nuclear programme, which the US has resisted. Romney is seen as more hawkish on this issue. But he is also even less inclined to push Israel towards allowing the Palestinians an independent state \u2013 another factor endearing him to Netanyahu.</p> <p>The opposition leader, Shaul Mofaz, publicly accused the prime minister of trying to influence the outcome of the election. \"Israeli meddling in internal US affairs and turning the US administration from an ally to an enemy has caused us severe damage,\" he told the Israeli parliament.</p> <p>Some commentators have warned that a re-elected Obama could seek a payback for what is regarded as Netanyahu's transparent support for his opponent. Netanyahu rejected accusations of interference, saying they were \"completely groundless\".</p> <p>Israel has figured strongly in the candidates' own campaigns. According to Eytan Gilboa, a specialist in US-Israel elections at Bar-Ilan University, \"never in the history of US presidential elections has Israel occupied such a prominent place\".</p> <p>This, he said, had been largely driven by Republicans, who \"thought if they can move a few percent [of Jewish voters] into their camp it could have a positive result in a very close election\".</p> <p>He added: \"Some in Israel are happy that the candidates are competing over who is the biggest supporter of Israel. But this is a negative development. It would be much better for Israel to enjoy bi-partisan high level support.\"</p> <p>Palestinians are watching the election campaign with cynicism. Many feel badly let down by Obama's failure to force progress towards a Palestinian state, but they also know that Romney is unlikely to be a friend to their cause.</p> <p>\"Obama is not a saviour, and Romney will not be a devil,\" said Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation executive committee. \"Neither one is a free agent; there is a US policy of bias and support for Israel.\" said Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation executive committee.</p> <p>Those who expected a re-elected Obama to \"suddenly develop a backbone and stand up to pressure\" were likely to be disappointed, she said. <br><strong>Harriet Sherwood, Jerusalem</strong></p> <h2>Africa</h2> <p>Obama's election provoked euphoria in his ancestral village in Kenya, as well as among African governments who scented a chance to move up the US's list of priorities.</p> <p>Four years later, there is largely a sense of deflation and, judging by column inches in the press, somewhat less enthusiasm for this year's presidential race. Sub-Saharan Africa has barely been mentioned in the campaign and the feeling of apathy is mostly mutual.</p> <p>Yet residual loyalty to Obama remains deep and, if Africa's billion citizens got to vote, it seems likely he would win by a landslide.</p> <p>\"Four years ago there was so much hope in this country,\" said Boniface Mwangi, a photographer and political activist whose office in Nairobi, Kenya, is decorated with Obama's image in life-size cardboard replica. \"Now we're no longer that hopeful and asking where did we go wrong. I thought Barack Obama would do well for Africa but I'm ashamed to say that George Bush did more. Obama has done nothing for us. People are very mad, especially in Kogelo, his family village: they're still expecting some kind of handout from [him]. I hope his second term plans will include Africa; otherwise he's a hoax.\"</p> <p>Kenya is preoccupied with its own elections. Yet despite everything, Mwangi, who took out a bank loan to be in America for Obama's historic 2008 win, hopes that he will repeat the feat. \"He's more progressive than Romney in every way. Romney will be bad for America and the world. He's shallow and slimy, like a car salesman selling junk.\"</p> <p>Obama, who once hailed the \"blood of Africa within me\", has spent only 20 hours on sub-Saharan African soil since becoming president (it was a stopover in Ghana in between summits elsewhere).</p> <p>By contrast, the president of China, Hu Jintao, has made seven trips to Africa, five as head of state, and visited at least 17 countries, according to the Brookings Institution.</p> <p>But the Democrat remains way ahead of Romney in terms of brand recognition. Shehu Sani, an author and human rights activist in Nigeria, said: \"Not many people in Africa know who Romney is and what he stands for and what he is capable of doing.</p> <p>\"Almost everyone knows who Obama is for the very fact that he is partly an African and there is still hope he will do something for Africa as far as peace, stability and economic development is concerned. There is a saying, 'better the devil you know'. If we haven't seen the actions, we have seen the intentions, so we give him the benefit of the doubt. We hope the second term will be better.\"</p> <p>Commentators note that Obama's principal African focus has been security, for example in combating Islamist militancy in Somalia, with pragmatism based on American self interest.</p> <p>Ousseynou Bissichi, a guide at the African Renaissance Monument, in Dakar, Senegal, who points out to tourists that his workplace is taller than the Statue of Liberty, said: \"A lot of people in Africa thought Obama would be the president of Africa. Go to any centre in Africa four years ago and people were celebrating.</p> <p>\"Later we realised he's an American president, not an African president. Even George Bush did more for Africa and he's a white man. Bill Clinton did, too.\"</p> <p>Yet Bissichi also remains loyal to Obama. \"In Africa, we like the Democrats more than the Republicans. We think they have more humanity than the Republicans. Mitt Romney is a very rich guy. Even in America, people think he knows nothing about poverty and misery.\"</p> <p>Some admit that Africa's hopes for the president were impossibly high. Asked if he had lived up to expectations, Michael Amankwa, an entrepreneur in Accra, Ghana, said: \"I think he has to a large extent, even though some might have been a bit disappointed. He came in with too much star power, which raised the bar very high for him. Some also understand that he inherited a bad situation with the economy and so on.\"</p> <p>South Africa, the continent's \"superpower\", has hosted the US's first lady, Michelle Obama, but still awaits the photo opportunity of America's first black president meeting Nelson Mandela.</p> <p>Karabo Kgoleng, a radio presenter in Johannesburg, said: \"I think it is disingenuous for Africans to expect anything from any American president. He is not African. He is American and his most important priority is the American people not the Africans.</p> <p>\"I think Africans rejoicing at his making it to office came from the need for a psychological boost as well as an indication of Africans buying into the American dream \u2013 that one's roots can be African and one can succeed in life, with those roots. Africans need to hold their own leaders to account before pinning their hopes on anyone else. Obama owes Africa nothing.\" <br><strong>David Smith, Africa correspondent</strong></p> <h2>Europe</h2> <p>The Obama-mania that swept Europe four years ago has faded fast amid transatlantic rows over the euro crisis, the administration's failure to deliver on its promise to close down Guant\u00e1namo Bay, and the waning attention paid to Europe by the US.</p> <p>But despite the fact that the centre-right remains in the ascendancy across most of Europe, disaffection with Barack Obama is not translating into support for Mitt Romney.</p> <p>Quite the opposite. There is strikingly little support for the Republican contender whose gaffe-prone visit to Europe in July won him few friends and who regularly turns European welfarism and \"entitlement societies\" into points of mockery in his campaign speeches.</p> <p>According to the New York Times, European diplomats in Washington have been discreetly lodging complaints with the Romney camp about the candidate's criticism.</p> <p>An opinion poll last month showed widespread dislike of Romney, and residual, if no longer starry-eyed, support for Obama among Europeans.</p> <p>Just 5% of those polled in France, Germany, and Britain had a good opinion of Romney. Only 4% of Germans polled said a President Romney would make them better-disposed towards the US, while 12 times that figure took the opposite view. Two in five French people said a Romney victory would turn them more against the US, while only 5% said they would be happier with him in the White House.</p> <p>By contrast 87% of Germans said they would vote for Obama, while in France 67% described him as their president of choice.</p> <p>The ongoing German love affair with Obama started in July 2008 when the would-be president was famously denied the chance to speak at Berlin's Brandenburg gate by the chancellor, Angela Merkel, and opted instead for the roundabout at the Victory column where thousands gathered to hear him speak, cementing his celebrity status in Berlin at least.</p> <p>Exploring why Obama's popularity had endured despite certain disappointments, Friedrich Mielke, said the president was viewed by Germans as a \"dove of peace\".</p> <p>The publicist and American expert said: \"We love him because we can project our own hopes and desires on to him,\" he said. Most people here see him as a leader of the free world, who combines intelligence and strength of character with charm and rhetorical lustre.\"</p> <p>Romney, by contrast, was viewed as a \"locust capitalist\", he said, who \"spreads social frigidity and egoism\".</p> <p>It appears that Europeans see Romney as a return to the days of George W Bush who was hugely unpopular on this side of the Atlantic.</p> <p>Romney has hardly sought to endear himself with Europeans, holding the EU up as a failed model and implicitly accusing Obama of being a closet \"European\" \u2013 big government, social welfare, and \"entitlement\" culture. <br><strong>Ian Traynor, Europe editor, and Kate Connolly in Berlin</strong></p> <h2>China</h2> <p>China's elite would normally be watching the election more closely. But with its own once-a-decade leadership transition beginning days after the US votes, it has other matters on its mind.</p> <p>For many in China, the election is of relatively limited interest. Some will follow results avidly, but others are only concerned about the impact on China.</p> <p>\"I like Obama's style. He is a very charming guy \u2026 Romney seems quite aggressive,\" said Beijing-based marketing researcher Ming Ming, adding: \"I'm more concerned about who will have better policy towards China.\"</p> <p>Zheng Jihua, an entrepreneur, said: \"I don't think it makes much difference whether it's Obama or Romney.\"</p> <p>Despite the tough-talking on tackling China during debates, he said: \"The economic connections [between the countries] matters more than political things. If they become president they will be more realistic.\"</p> <p>China is used to playing its part in US presidential races. \"It's an old story, China becoming a political card to play in US elections. This year, Romney and Obama seem to be playing it more heavily,\" an editorial in the populist state-run Global Times said last month.</p> <p>But Shi Yinhong, an expert on Sino-US relations at Renmin University, said most people were more concerned by issues such as tensions with Japan over disputed islands.</p> <p>\"For those who are paying attention, I guess they may feel both sides are not so nice towards China,\" he said. \"I think maybe in government and the foreign policy elites they feel the lesser evil is still Barack Obama because they're familiar with him.</p> <p>\"If you look at the campaign statements, Romney has been much more combative in terms of US economic rivalry.\"</p> <p>Shen Dingli, director of the Centre for American Studies at Fudan University, disagreed. He argued that while China did not officially have a preference - due to the country's doctrine of non-interference in other nations' domestic affairs - in reality it leant to Republicans.</p> <p>\"The Republicans are pro-development, pro-foreign trade, pro-efficiency, pro-capitalism,\" he said, and were unlikely to push hard for cuts to China's carbon emissions, while Democrats \"are pro-American poor people and want to protect jobs\".</p> <p>Shen added: \"People claim if Romney is in power, the next day he will tackle China for manipulating the currency. It's a joke. Romney will be China's best friend because he will not honour his threats.\"</p> <p>Experts say tough talk from US candidates is rarely matched by their action once in office. Even so, Shi warned that in general \"Sino-American rivalries have become more profound and sometimes more tense.\"<br><strong> Tania Branigan, Beijing</strong></p> <h2>Iran</h2> <p>\"Which one is better for Iran, Obama or Romney?\" asked Ebrahim Asgharzadeh, a political activist and leader behind the US embassy hostage-taking after the 1979 Islamic revolution.</p> <p>\"The answer is not very difficult,\" he said, during the television debate. He was insinuating that Iran should be worried about the prospect of Romney winning.</p> <p>Asgharzadeh, who is now sympathetic to reformists, suggested Iran should play a role in helping Obama stay in office. \"We influenced American elections back at the time of Reagan [with negotiations over hostage crisis] and we can do it now. Iran can influence with a surprise.\"</p> <p>Iranians are closely following the election. There is concern that a Romney victory will significantly increase the possibility of an Israeli military strike against the regime's nuclear facilities, and weaken the prospect of a possible breakthrough in negotiations between Tehran and the west. The Obama administration, by contrast, is keen to give sanctions more time to bite.</p> <p>\"The US election results can potentially change the fate of my country,\" said an Iranian journalist based in Tehran. \"Many activists and those with access to internet or [illegal] satellite dishes are watching it closely.\"</p> <p>Iranian state agencies are reporting the developments of Obama-Romney campaigns but with little commentary. Iranian officials, however, say that the outcome is immaterial to Iran.</p> <p>Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Iran's president, while speaking among to reporters in New York during a visit to the UN general assembly last month, refused to show support to either candidate.</p> <p>Ali Larijani, Iran's speaker in parliament, said a Romney win would not be a threat. In his view, the governor's support for Israel's possible attack amounted to little more than campaign rhetoric. <br><strong>Saeed Kamali Dehghan</strong></p> <h2>Russia</h2> <p>With anti-Americanism creeping back to the forefront of political rhetoric in Moscow, many in Russia slyly smiled when Romney this year called Russia \"our No 1 geopolitical foe\".</p> <p>Vladimir Putin, Russia's president, said the remark showed Romney was \"open and sincere\". He added: \"That Romney considers us enemy No 1 and apparently has bad feelings about Russia is a minus, but, considering that he expresses himself bluntly, openly and clearly, [this] means he is an open and sincere man, which is a plus</p> <p>\"We will be oriented toward pluses, not minuses. And I am actually very grateful to him for formulating his position in a straightforward manner.\"</p> <p>The statement harked back to Soviet times, when Russia's leaders preferred dealing with Republicans \u2013 who were seen as straight-talking, if tough \u2013 to Democrats, seen here as masking their anti-Russian stance behind talk of human and civil rights, viewed with suspicion inside Russia.</p> <p>Maria Lipman, an expert at the Moscow Carnegie Centre, said: \"Particularly after the expulsion of the USAid, Washington's international aid agency, the Kremlin is now too committed to a path of using its old cold war foe as a bogeyman to consolidate wavering domestic support. Anti-American rhetoric in Russia has gone too far to shift easily now.\"</p> <p>Nor has there been much effort from the US presidential candidates to address policy towards Russia except for cheap point scoring, she added, and the next occupant of the White House was unlikely to seek to introduce any significant changes.</p> <p>Romney even appears in private to be backpedalling on his \"number one geopolitical foe\" comment. He used his son, Matt Romney, to pass a placatory message to Putin last month during a business trip to Moscow, according to a recent report in the New York Times.</p> <p>Many Russians have little interest in the race going on in the US, remaining sceptical that it can influence their lives.</p> <p>In a suburban train heading into Moscow on Friday evening, there was widespread indifference. \"Honestly, I don't care,\" said Sergei Chernenko, a 23-year old barman, adding that the election's outcome was irrelevant.</p> <p>Irina Kaidina, an accountant, concurred. Her son lived in New York, she said, but she couldn't remember the name of Barack Obama's challenger.</p> <p>Assistant engineer Nikolai Kuprianov, 32, however, said he had been following the presidential campaign. \"Obama would, of course, be a better choice in terms of attitudes towards Russia but Americans have never loved Russia and they only want us for our natural resources,\" he said.</p> <p>Obama had made the \"reset\" in relations with Russia an early foreign policy priority, but with recent disagreements over Syria, plus Moscow's accusation that the US stands behind opposition protests against Putin, what was once hailed as a success is now seen as dead.</p> <p>Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, said as much in an interview published this week: \"If we talk about the 'reset', it is clear that, using computer terminology, it cannot last forever. Otherwise it would not be a 'reset' but a program failure\".</p> <p>Among Russia's chief concerns are energy policy \u2013 Putin's ability to govern rests on a high oil price, analysts say \u2013 and US plans for missile defence in Europe, which it opposes but both candidates support. <br><strong>Miriam Elder and Howard Amos</strong></p> <h2>Pakistan</h2> <p>The US elections have serious implications for Pakistan and policy making, but that is not reflected in popular debate or discussion.</p> <p>While government officials complain that there is little chance of key issues, such as efforts to draw the Taliban into a political process, being dealt with before the the election, public interest in the contest is virtually nil.</p> <p>Perhaps that is not surprising with anti-Americanism appearing to be at an all-time high in Pakistan.</p> <p>There has been little media interest in the campaign, with some of the most recent reports about the US president concerning the burning of effigies of him to protest against a blasphemous anti-Islam film posted on YouTube.</p> <p>There is certainly none of the enthusiasm Obama mustered in the Muslim world in 2008, said Munawar Hasan, president of the conservative Islamic party Jamaat-e-Islami.</p> <p>\"After the last four years people now know that Americans are Americans and George Bush and Barack Obama are two sides of the same coin,\" he said, damning US policy on the region, including the sharp increase in drone strikes and the troop surge in Afghanistan. No one is interested in this election because, whoever wins, US foreign policy is not going to change.\"</p> <p>Some suspect the country's military establishment may harbour a stronger desire to see the back of Obama as his administration, in sharp contrast to that of George Bush (and Republican governments in general), was not afraid of playing rough with Pakistan, even at the expense of humiliating its armed forces.</p> <p>The May 2011 raid to kill Osama bin Laden within Pakistani territory still haunts the army and the country has struggled to cope with the massive increase in US drone attacks on its tribal areas.</p> <p>Even worse was the accidental US airstrike on the Afghan border last year which killed 24 troops and prompted months of acrimony between Islamabad and Washington. <br><strong>Jon Boone, Islamabad</strong></p> <h2>Latin America</h2> <p>The US election has been watched with no little self-interest in Latin America, where many politicians and commentators partly define themselves by their admiration or rejection of US values.</p> <p>While most national leaders have remained diplomatically quiet about their preferences, the Venezuelan president, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, who recently won re-election, has bucked the trend by stating his preference for Obama.</p> <p>\"I hope this doesn't harm Obama, but if I was from the US, I'd vote for Obama,\" Chavez said on state TV and indicated that he felt the admiration was mutual. \"Obama is a good guy \u2026 I think that if Obama was from Barlovento or some Caracas neighborhood, he'd vote for Chavez.\"</p> <p>The US president is likely to pick up more Hispanic votes from the endorsement of the Mexican band Man\u00e1, who played a set at an Obama rally in Las Vegas this month. \"We have the conviction that Obama is the best candidate for all Latinos,\" said Man\u00e1 frontman Fher Olvera. \"Vote for the president who has cared most for Latinos and minorities.\"</p> <p>In Brazil, which is in the midst of a municipal election campaign, the president, Dilma Rousseff, does not appear to see any political advantage in allying herself to either US candidate, partly because of differences in foreign policy.</p> <p>Regarding Obama's speech on the handling of the crisis in Syria at the UN late last month, Rousseff said: \"He has his position, I have mine.\"</p> <p>Brazilian media commentators have been underwhelmed by the performance of the two US candidates.</p> <p>\"The speech in which US president Barack Obama, formally accepted the nomination of the Democratic Party to run for a new mandate caused an anticlimax, even for his most excited voters,\" noted Folha de S. Paulo in one of the few Brazilian editorials on the US election. <br><strong>Jonathan Watts, Rio de Janeiro</strong></p> <h2>Arab world</h2> <p>Arabs watching the US presidential race are mainly interested in how the next administration will deal with the Arab spring \u2013 as well as the perennial question of the unresolved Palestinian issue.</p> <p>Barack Obama has, in significant ways, failed to live up to the expectations he created in his long-awaited Cairo speech in June 2009. Many in the region say they see little difference between him and Romney, but Obama is probably still the preferred candidate.</p> <p>Obama was criticised initially for reacting slowly to the revolution in Egypt but has been measured since the Muslim Brotherhood's Mohamed Mursi became president and hopes to encourage a shift toward pragmatism and moderation.</p> <p>Following the murder of the US ambassador to Libya, Washington also signalled continued support for the new government in Tripoli.</p> <p>Syrian and Arab opponents of Bashar al-Assad hope that in a second term Obama would be more openly supportive than he has been so far.</p> <p>Romney's policies reflect a more conservative world view that appeals to Saudis and their Gulf allies, who believe Obama has been too soft on Iran. Saudis hope that a Romney administration, with a neoconservative element, might be more aggressive on Syria. The Republican has expressed \"disappointment\" at the rise of Islamists. </p> <p>He is also likely to give greater weight to Israel's regional views, for example as they pertain to policy towards Egypt. Both candidates would likely remain muted in response to the ongoing protests and crackdown in Bahrain, a key US ally in the Gulf. </p> <p>The novelty for the next president will be that public opinion is now a more significant factor in the Arab world than it was when Obama entered the White House. It did not inspire confidence when Romney referred to the shooting at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin as taking place at a \"sheikh\" temple. <br><strong>Ian Black, Middle East editor</strong></p> <h2>Afghanistan</h2> <p>For a place where US troops are still dying in their hundreds and for which billions of dollars are spent each year, Afghanistan has garnered very little attention over the election.</p> <p>With a strange kind of symmetry Afghanistan might be dependent on US cash to keep its government afloat, and the US military to keep the Taliban at bay, but there is very little focus on the presidential race on the streets or in the TV studios of Kabul.</p> <p>This lack of interest is in large part because most people in Kabul feel the broad outlines of US policy have already been set. The timeline for the departure of US and other foreign forces will not alter, regardless of who wins.</p> <p>\"The Afghan people are not paying a lot of attention to the US election, because as we heard during the campaign, both candidates are agreed about taking their troops home from Afghanistan,\" said Najibullah Hosseini, a 32-year-old 32, a professor at a private university.</p> <p>Newspapers and television channels are running stories about the election, but there is little debate on popular chat shows or in the opinion pages.</p> <p>In one report, the popular newspaper 8am underlined that the US had already made a long-term commitment to supporting Afghanistan.</p> <p>\"Both candidates said there should be no worries about US and international aid to the country,\" the report said, before adding that it was in Washington's interest to ensure the country did not become a haven for terrorists, regardless of who was in the White House.</p> <p>Diplomats are similarly sanguine about the election results. The winner will have to decide exactly how fast they want to bring the rest of US forces home, but neither Romney nor Obama is likely to deviate from a 2014 deadline agreed with Nato allies and the Afghan government.</p> <p>\"A review of policy will take place any way, irrespective of who wins, and the overall mood in the US is very much focused on the honourable exit,\" said one senior diplomat in Kabul. \"If Romney wins, there may be more of a deep dive. He may be more critical in assessing what is under the surface of the positive narrative \u2026 but overall I don't think the election result will have a major impact here.\"</p> <p>Some Afghans, however, are still hopeful the election will bring change, with aspirations not far different from those of US voters weary with the steady flow of young men and women returning home in coffins, and the steep cost of a war amid a struggling economy.</p> <p>\"I want to ask the US voters to select a man who will talk with the Taliban to end the war. We don't want any more people to be killed, we want the economy to be fixed,\" said 50-year-old Shah Agha Nazari, head of a local council in Kabul's Neka Khana area. <br><strong>Emma Graham-Harrison and Mokhtar Amiri</strong></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 6 November 2012.

  "<p>Democrats are increasingly confident of retaining control of the Senate \u2013 achieving a target that looked all but beyond them earlier this year \u2013 with polls suggesting the Republicans will be punished for their conservative views on rape and abortion.</p> <p>The Republicans had been expecting to overturn the Democrats' slim 53-47 majority, adding the Senate to the already Republican-controlled House, providing them with a powerful base to challenge Barack Obama or support a Mitt Romney presidency.</p> <p>But these hopes have receded. One of the biggest blows is in Indiana, a state the Republicans have held since 1976. The latest poll shows the Republican Richard Mourdock trailing 11 points behind Democrat Joe Donnelly. The Tea Party-backed Mourdock is suffering from his comment that pregnancy from rape was \"something God intended\".</p> <p>A senior Republican, former Mississippi governor Haley Barbour, admitted on Sunday that the Grand Old Party was unlikely to take the Senate. Interviewed on CNN, he predicted it would be close. Pushed on what he meant by this, he went further: \"Means no cigar.\"</p> <p>Polls suggest that Congress will emerge from Tuesday's elections almost unchanged. The prospect of status quo means Washington faces at least another two years of deadlock, with the Democratic Senate and Republican House cancelling each other out and the chances of significant new legislation poor.</p> <p>It will also mean that if Obama is re-elected, more standoffs between the White House and the Republican-led House, beginning with the impending deadline for dealing with the deficit and massive spending cuts \u2013 the so-called 'fiscal cliff'.</p> <p>The Democratic leader in the Senate, Harry Reid, warned Romney last week that if he became president, he could expect little in the way of co-operation from the Democrats. He dismissed as \"fantasy\" his claim that he was better placed than Obama to bring back bipartisan co-operation.</p> <p>Thirty-three of the senate's 100 seats are being fought over, with at least 10 of them regarded as toss-ups. All 435 House seats are also being contested.</p> <p>The Republicans hold 241 seats in the House to the Democrats' 194. The Republican majority could be reduced but the chance of the Democrats retaking control remains extremely remote.</p> <p>The races have produced a colourful array of candidates and offer the prospect of a number of firsts, from the first \u2013 at least to be open about it \u2013 lesbian senator, Tammy Baldwin, in Wisconsin, to the first Republican black congresswoman, Mia Love. There are minor historical footnotes, too, such as the almost certain return of a Kennedy to Congress: Joseph P Kennedy, the grandson of Robert Kennedy.</p> <p>The Republican party has been in self-destruct mode in recent months, facing the prospect of failing in states that should have been easy gains, as it did in the 2010 mid-term elections when it fielded a disastrous set of Tea Party candidates.</p> <p>As well as the prospect of losing an Indiana Senate seat, the Republicans have made it difficult for themselves in what was the Democrats' most vulnerable seat, Missouri. Republican Todd Akin's suggestion that some rapes were \"legitimate\" turned a near-certain gain into a toss-up race.</p> <p>The Democrat Claire McCaskill had been struggling in Missouri, trailing Akin up until that remark. According to Real Clear Politics, she now holds a five-point lead. Republicans, after initially distancing themselves from Akin over the rape remark, are pouring money in behind him and polls show him eating into McCaskill's poll lead.</p> <p>With a moderate in place instead of a Tea Party-backed one, the Republicans would have been almost guaranteed victory instead of sweating over the outcome.</p> <p>The Republicans are almost certain to lose Maine, again as a result of the party's move to the right. It was held for the party by Olympia Snowe, an old-fashioned Republican moderate who believed in bipartisanship and became dismayed with polarised politics and the resulting Washington deadlock.</p> <p>An independent, Angus King, is in line to take Maine and is expected to caucus alongside the Democrats. The Republicans ended up in the bizarre position of spending money on ads supporting the Democratic candidate in Maine, hoping to split the Democratic and independent vote, allowing the Republican to slip through.</p> <p>Crossroads GPS, a super-political action committee co-founded by George W Bush's strategist Karl Rove, has spent almost $1m (\u00a3620,000) in attacks on King.</p> <p>The Democrats are hopeful of taking back the normally solidly Democratic state of Massachusetts where Republican Scott Brown is battling to hold on against a strong push from one of the Democratic party's most prominent liberals, Elizabeth Warren. The Real Clear Politics average shows Warren ahead by five points.</p> <p>Even if the Democrats were to lose their majority, they would still be able to block legislation from a Republican-controlled House. The Republicans would need a 60-40 majority in order to overcome any Democratic filibustering.</p> <p>There is a small chance that when all the results are in on Wednesday that the Senate could be tied on 50-50. The casting vote would then rest with whoever is vice-president.</p> <h2>The key House races</h2> <p><strong>Minnesota: </strong>A classic example of how fast political fortunes can change. ln August 2011, Michele Bachmann won the Iowa straw poll of Republican candidates, giving rise to a slew of media stories that she might be the party's presidential candidate. But that proved an illusion for the high-profile congresswoman, who is backed by the Tea Party. She is now battling to hold her seat in the House. A poll for the Minneapolis Star Tribune has her ahead in the polls but not enough for comfort, 51-45.</p> <p><strong>Utah: </strong>Mia Love could become the first Republican black congresswoman. Polls show her with a slight edge over the Democrat Jim Matheson.</p> <p><strong>Illinois: </strong>Tammy Duckworth, who lost two limbs as a helicopter pilot in Iraq, is the Democratic candidate battling to take a House seat from Republican Joe Walsh.</p> <h2>The key Senate races</h2> <p><strong>Connecticut: </strong>One of the biggest-spending races in the country other than the White House. Linda McMahon, the Republican candidate who made a fortune as an executive promoting wrestling, is taking on Democrat Chris Murphy. She has spent more than $42m of her own money. But Connecticut is traditionally Democratic territory even if the previous incumbent Joe Lieberman, who is retiring, was an independent.</p> <p><strong>Missouri: </strong>One of the most widely watched races to see if Republican Todd Akin will be punished for his views on rape and abortion, summed up in his remark about \"legitimate rape\".</p> <p><strong>Massachusetts:</strong> Republican Scott Brown took normally solidly Democratic Massachusetts after the death of Ted Kennedy. The victory was a shock to the Democrats who hope that Elizabeth Warren can take it back.</p> <p><strong>Indiana: </strong>Repubican candidate Richard Mourdock, like Akin in Missouri, is on the defensive after explaining his opposition to abortion. \"And I think even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that it is something that God intended to happen.\"</p> <p><strong>Wisconsin: </strong>Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat, could become the first lesbian \u2013 or at least the first to be open about it \u2013 elected to the Senate.</p>",

It appeared that the learned Lord Justice had decided to light the blue touch paper immediately because his opening comment to Mr Beloff was the the Court took a \"pretty dim view\" of what Apple had done. Further kindling was provided by Sir Robin Jacob, who said that he was \"completely at a loss to understand how a company like Apple could do such a thing and then go on justifying it\" [Katnote: Sir Robin is never at a loss to understand anything, is that he completely understands why Apple did it, but that Apple was at a loss to explain how it thought it could get away with it before a British Court].</p> <p> Michael Beloff manfully attempted to dodge the increasing flames and justify what Apple had done. His primary point was that the earlier order had not prohibited Apple from making additional statements and, indeed, in the course of the earlier hearing Mr Carr had said that Apple could \"say what they like\".
