  "<p>'There are two ways you can interest [the average American] in a campaign, and only two that we have ever found successful,\" wrote <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/09/24/120924fa_fact_lepore?currentPage=1\" title=\"\">Clem Whitaker</a>, the co-founder of America's first political consulting firm. \"He likes a good hot battle, with no punches pulled ...\", or \"he likes the movies; he likes mysteries; he likes fireworks and parades ... So if you can't fight, PUT ON A SHOW! And if you put on a good show, Mr and Mrs America will turn out to see it\".</p> <p>With just a fortnight to go before polling day, the \"show\" has been terrible. Democrats are running the same acts that they did last time, and hoping that nobody will notice. Concluding the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UANbTju765A\" title=\"\">first TV debate</a>, President Barack Obama's closing argument was: \"Four years ago I said that I'm not a perfect man and I wouldn't be a perfect president ... But I also promised that I'd fight every single day on behalf of the American people and the middle class, and all those who are striving to get in the middle class. I've kept that promise and if you'll vote for me, then I promise I'll fight just as hard in a second term.\" I tried my best. I want another go. It's hardly a pitch bursting with vision.</p> <p>His opponent, Mitt Romney, is worse. He has <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/19/opinion/krugman-snow-job-on-jobs.html?_r=1&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1350831834-8/bD5WjKMmB/fFbe5KDbmg\" title=\"\">visions a-plenty</a>. In his crystal ball he sees a land of free-market unicorns galloping under tax-slashing, deficit-reducing rainbows where, if only government would get out of the way, prosperity would fall from the sky. Those are the visions that he will admit to, and insists that he has costed. The ones he won't take ownership of look like a black and white version of Mike Leigh's 2004 film about illegal abortion in 1950s London, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/sep/07/venicefilmfestival2004.londonfilmfestival2004\" title=\"\">Vera Drake</a>, in a land full of ungrateful moochers.</p> <p>It's not a difficult or inspiring choice, particularly for progressives. And it's not much of a show, either. The most sympathetic character has terrible lines;&#xa0;his foil has no character; and there has not been much of a plot to lose. There are serious issues to be dealt&#xa0;with and there are debates about policy, morality and ideology to be had and, contrary to Whitaker's claim, many&#xa0;\"average Americans\" are interested in them. But elections, apparently, aren't the place to have them or to resolve the issues in question.</p> <p>But while the show may be dull, the fight has just got very interesting. What was beginning to look like a foregone conclusion, in which the contest was always close but an Obama victory increasingly likely, is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/17/barack-obama-election-gary-younge\" title=\"\">now wide open</a>. Few now doubt that Romney could win. Indeed it's indicative of just how poor the show has been that Obama's eight-month lead could be eroded with a single poor 90-minute performance. Before then, he was leading by default. Once Romney's Etch a Sketch finally settled upon a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/oct/17/hofstra-presidential-debate-instapolls-obama-romney\" title=\"\">plausible version of himself</a>, the uncommitted and unconvinced were prepared to take a second look.</p> <p>The final two weeks will be volatile. On Saturday alone, three different national <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/latest_polls/\" title=\"\">polls ranged from showing Romney ahead by 6% to him trailing Obama by 3%</a>. Obama maintains a wafer-thin lead in enough swing states to remain the favourite. But that lead is decreasing, and in several places \u2013 <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/20/oct-19-after-romney-gains-should-obama-concede-florida/\" title=\"\">Florida</a>, <a href=\"http://www2.timesdispatch.com/news/2012/oct/21/tdmain01-battle-for-virginia-intensifies-ar-2299505/\" title=\"\">Virginia</a>, Colorado and <a href=\"http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/10/19/3057214/romney-campaign-begins-pulling.html\" title=\"\">North Carolina</a> \u2013 it has disappeared completely. Barring something unforeseen during the last debate, the outcome will be shaped by three related factors: enthusiasm, organisation and cash.</p> <p>Polls suggest that there is no significant enthusiasm gap between the&#xa0;two parties. Democrats still genuinely love their candidate, Republicans have learned to tolerate theirs. Romney's inauthenticity as a conservative was the price they were willing to pay for his electability as a candidate. When he looked like a loser, the base felt they had the worst of both worlds. Now that he's viable, they are engaged. The momentum is definitely with the Republicans. They are cresting late and strong. Conversely, in three short weeks, Democrats have gone from complacency to panic to relief, and are only now regaining confidence.</p> <p>They'll need it. Enthusiasm is important for two main reasons. The first is voters: people need to be energised enough to get to the polls. The second is volunteers: someone has to get them there. This is a much bigger issue for Democrats, whose base of young, black and Latino voters traditionally manage a lower turnout and have fared particularly badly under Obama.</p> <p>That's where organisation comes in and <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/10/19/ground-game-obama-campaign-opens-up-a-big-lead-in-field-offices.html\" title=\"\">the Democrats are more impressive</a>. They have three times as many field offices as the Republicans in Ohio, and more than twice as many in Florida and Nevada. The Republicans insist that this is of little significance. They may be right. Offices don't necessarily mean action. On Saturday morning the Obama office in Ybor City, near Tampa in Florida, was empty, and the county headquarters was closed.</p> <p>Nonetheless, Democrats are clearly doing something right. Considerably more voters in the swing states say they have been contacted by them during the last month than by Republicans. Meanwhile, 3m votes have been cast nationwide. In <a href=\"http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/10/18/polls-obama-has-advantage-in-wisconsin-iowa/\" title=\"\">Iowa</a>, a third of likely voters said they have already voted, and Obama leads among them by&#xa0;some 67% to 32%. In <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-p-mcdonald/early-voting-spinning_b_1989094.html\" title=\"\">Ohio, Florida and North Carolina,</a> the picture is more&#xa0;mixed and inconclusive \u2013 but, broadly speaking, at&#xa0;this early stage Democrats are doing better at the actual polls than in the opinion polls.</p> <p>That's just as well. For gains earned in sweat on one side can be clawed back with cheques by the other \u2013 a fact born out in Wisconsin in June, during the recall vote where grassroots mobilisations could not compete with massive advertising buys. Romney knows this. During the primaries, he and his surrogates would eke out narrow victories from statistical draws with millions of dollars in TV advertising. He doesn't have the <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/19/democratic-money-pours-into-super-pacs/\" title=\"\">cash advantage</a> over Obama that he did against his primary challengers. But with unlimited donations now legal, a major cash infusion at this late stage on either side could make all the difference \u2013 and it's more liable to come Romney's way than Obama's.</p> <p>Like many, I would rather talk about what will change than who will win. But the show is lame, and the fight is on. The question of who will win and how has become urgent, unpredictable and dramatic in a manner few could have imagined. Almost every outcome lies within the margin of error. Those margins are getting narrower. And the error could be great.</p> <p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/garyyounge\" title=\"\"><em>@garyyounge</em></a></p>",
  "<p>If Russia and Iran have been culpable, there has been a catastrophic failure of diplomacy by the west and its allies. UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon's call for a ceasefire and an arms embargo is a welcome challenge to the west's floundering policy. Britain, France and the US, as well as their allies, Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, need to recognise that neither side is going to win the civil war engulfing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/syria\" title=\"\">Syria</a>. Nor will the Turkey's call for western military intervention to halt the humanitarian disaster resolve the crisis. A political solution has to be the priority.</p> <p>The Syrian leader, Bashar al-Assad, is reported to be willing to consider the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/middle-east-live/2012/oct/17/syria-crisis-ceasefire-attempt-live\" title=\"\">proposal by the UN-Arab League envoy, Lakhdar Brahimi, for a ceasefire</a> for the four-day Eid al-Adha holiday on 26&#xa0;October. The western powers and the&#xa0;Arab arms suppliers should urge their friends in the opposition to declare they will reciprocate if Assad makes good on his tentative promise.</p> <p>Western demands for regime change were never going to work because this isn't simply a conflict between a savage regime and the Syrian people. Assad and the ruling Shia-aligned Alawite minority form a tenth of the population and fear being oppressed by the Sunni majority. Christians and other minorities are similarly nervous. Together, those behind Assad constitute nearly a third of Syrians.</p> <p>The war has also become a wider proxy for Sunni versus Shia, and Saudi Arabia versus Iran. There is also bitter suspicion at the west's real intentions from Russia and China and their allies. They insist that they never authorised UN backing for military force to depose <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/muammar-gaddafi\" title=\"\">Muammar Gaddafi</a> last year, and refuse to be \"tricked\" again. The Iraq invasion also poisons trust of the west. Libya today \u2013 its people at the mercy of warring militias and jihadist opportunists, the US ambassador assassinated \u2013 is hardly a good advertisement for repeating that regime-change recipe in more complex Syria.</p> <p>David Cameron's recent high-minded <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/26/david-cameron-un-inaction-syria\" title=\"\">rhetoric at the UN general assembly</a> ignored the presence of al-Qaida fighters among the west's favoured rebels.Assad and the minorities and other popular forces that support him fear becoming victims of genocide, so will fight on. If&#xa0;the&#xa0;Syrian regime was somehow toppled without a settlement being in&#xa0;place, the country would descend into even greater chaos.</p> <p>Russia is determined not to allow that anarchy, mainly because Syria provides its only Mediterranean port in the region. Iran also has key interests, malevolent or otherwise. Syrian refugees have already flooded into Turkey and Lebanon, the latter destabilised, with its police chief assassinated, and now plunged into a political crisis.</p> <p>The only way forward is to broker a political settlement, with Russia using its leverage to ensure that Assad negotiates seriously. Without pandering to Vladimir Putin's ruthless rigidity, engagement with Russia is critical \u2013 as is consultation with Iran. Otherwise a settlement will not happen.The guidelines for a political transition approved by the five permanent members of the UN security council at&#xa0;the Geneva conference in June still provides the best road map \u2013 but only if&#xa0;the US, the UK, Saudi Arabia and their&#xa0;allies drop their current stance and&#xa0;help to implement it.</p> <p>However unpalatable, Assad may have to be granted immunity in order to get him to sign up and stop his barbarity. All state employees, including those in the armed forces, must be allowed to keep their posts, to avoid a repeat of the chaos caused by America's de-Ba'athification in Iraq. A Yemen-type process may even figure. There, a hated president did not resign but did not stand for re-election. A coalition government of national unity could then prepare for Syrian elections, due in 2014.</p> <p>The current British-American policy is failing on a monumental scale. Unless there is a radical change, all the hand-wringing and condemnation is either empty or hypocritical \u2013 or both.</p>",
  "<p>Despite his position as a bastion of the liberal left, both sides of Washington's political divide united to pay tribute to George McGovern on Sunday.</p> <p>President Barack Obama described the former senator as a statesman of \"great conscience and conviction\", adding that McGovern was someone who \"dedicated his life to serving the country he loved\".</p> <p>Meanwhile Mitt Romney added to the tributes, tweeting that he and wife Ann extended their condolences to family of McGovern, who was an \"unwavering standard bearer of his party and a hero of World War II\".</p> <p>Republican senator for South Dakota John Thune was amongst the conservative voices paying tribute.</p> <p>\"Despite our political difference, I was always proud to call Senator McGovern my friend and he will be deeply missed by those he met and those who were fortunate enough to experience his goodwill through the world,\" Thune said in a statement.</p> <p>He noted that throughout his post-political life, McGovern won plaudits for his \"crusade against hunger\" both at home and internationally.</p> <p>McGovern and former Republican senator Bob Dole collaborated to create an international food for education and child nutrition programme, for which they shared the 2008 World Food Prize.</p> <p>Former president Bill Clinton and his wife, serving state secretary Hillary Clinton, said in a statement Sunday that while McGovern was \"a tireless advocate for human rights and dignity\", his greatest passion was helping feed the hungry.</p> <p>They added: \"The programs he created helped feed millions of people, including food stamps in the 1960s and the international school feeding program in the 90s, both of which he co-sponsored with Senator Bob Dole.\"</p> <p>\"We must continue to draw inspiration from his example and build the world he fought for.\"</p> <p>In his statement, Obama also alluded the late politician's stance against the Vietnam war.</p> <p>He said of McGovern: \"He signed up to fight in World War II, and became a decorated bomber over the battlefield of Europe. When the people of South Dakota sent him to Washington, this hero of war became a champion for peace.\"</p>",
  "<p>A new poll of voter intention has president Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney neck-and-neck with just over two weeks to go until election day.</p> <p>Announced on NBC's Meet the Press, the NBC/Wall Street Journal survey has the two candidates in a dead heat at 47% each.</p> <p>A breakdown of the figures shows that Obama still has a lead amongst a women, but even that advantage is now down to 51% to 43% \u2013 the smallest gap in a year of polling, NBC correspondent Chuck Todd said.</p> <p>And in a further worrying development for the White House incumbent, Romney had opened up a \"little bit of a lead\" over his opponent in key battleground states, it was announced on the programme.</p> <p>The poll, conducted after last week's presidential debate, is in line with other recent polls that suggest that the Republicans have narrowed the gap in recent weeks and that the outcome of the election is still very much in the balance.</p> <p>Such a tight race is likely to put emphasis on the importance of two set-piece events due to take place in advance of the national ballot on 6 November: Monday's final presidential debate, and monthly jobs figures slated for release just days before America goes to the polls.</p>",
  "<p>Away from the Middle East, Barack Obama's foreign policy has been largely about turning to Asia, sending mixed signals to Latin America, ignoring sub-Saharan Africa \u2013 and hoping that Europe and its implacable crisis go away.</p> <p>Arguably the single most important strategic decision of his first term was the \"pivot\" to Asia \u2013 the promise this year to deploy 60% of naval assets to the Asia-Pacific region by 2020. Chinese analysts say this is the principal reason why bilateral relations are now at their lowest point since Obama became president.</p> <p>Otherwise, the Obama administration has taken care not to upset the Chinese unduly. Obama himself waited more than two years before privately meeting the Dalai Lama; the secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, made it clear early on that disagreements over human rights should not interfere with co-operation on broader issues between the world's two foremost economic powers.</p> <p>The other rising power of the east, India, usually enjoys better relations with the US when a Republican president is in office. But Obama, who visited India in November 2010, charmed his hosts with flattering references to their country's heritage and booming economy, a stab at speaking Hindi in parliament and a promise of support for a permanent seat on the United Nations security council, a long-cherished ambition that is extremely unlikely to be fulfilled any time soon. If the style was there \u2014 Indians were delighted by the youthful charisma of the president and his wife compared with the stuffy and status-obsessed local politicians \u2014 the substance has been less evident, however. Major defence deals have gone elsewhere, the Indians are deeply concerned by the US rush to exit Afghanistan \u2013 which they fear could benefit hostile neighbour Pakistan \u2013 and nothing as significant as the 2008 US-India nuclear deal that his predecessor pushed through has even been spoken of.</p> <p>On Africa, Obama \u2013 the son of a Kenyan \u2013 has spent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jul/12/barack-obama\" title=\"\">less than 24 hours in sub-Saharan Africa</a> as president \u2013 and failed to produce a signature policy initiative, leaving many with a sense of anti-climax. \"The president's Kenyan heritage inspired unreasonably high hopes for a robust Africa policy, but his administration has failed to meet even the lowest of expectations,\" <a href=\"http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/138158/todd-moss/missing-in-africa?page=show\" title=\"\">wrote Todd Moss recently</a> in Foreign Affairs.</p> <p>\"Even Obama's most vocal supporters quietly admit that he has done much less with Africa than previous presidents have.\"</p> <p>But Clinton has made four trips and notched up 15 African countries. Most recently she was accompanied by executives from some of America's leading companies including Boeing, Walmart and FedEx. This underlines an evolving philosophy of seeing Africa more as investment destination than aid-hungry victim. Militarily, America's backing of African Union peacekeepers in Somalia has been a quiet triumph but al-Qaida's tentacles now stretch to countries such as Mali. Despite the disappointments, Obama still commands popular support \u2013 Conakry, the capital of Guinea, has more than one \"Obama\" cafe and restaurant.</p> <p>Obama has tweaked rather than transformed US policy towards Latin America, despite the increased influence and integration of a region that is growing economically and becoming more dependent on China. Aside from a slight relaxation of the embargo on Cuba in 2009, the White House has largely continued the approach of previous administrations by putting a priority on the (losing) battle against narcotics trafficking. Promises to put more emphasis on reducing US demand as well as Latin American supply have failed to produce results: drug use and murder rates are both rising.</p> <p>Mixed signals on other matters have not helped to impress other nations in the region. The US initially condemned the 2009 coup in Honduras against the leftwing leader Jos\u00e9 Manuel Zelaya but has subsequently supported the administration of Porfirio Lobo. Obama also signed a free trade agreement with Colombia despite opposing such a measure when it was initiated under the previous administration.</p> <p>The rhetorical pitch has, however, softened compared with the era of George W Bush. The Venezuelan president, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, has said he would choose Obama if he could vote in the forthcoming election, which is likely to be a mixed blessing.</p> <p>On Russia, an early move to \"reset\" relations and make progress on nuclear arms reduction has been more than outweighed by a new deterioration in relations, sparked by Vladimir Putin's crackdown on the opposition, and diametrically opposed world views on Syria.</p> <p>This leaves Europe and the spiralling debt and currency crisis. The Obama administration has been exasperated by Europe's response to the crisis and has consistently urged policymakers to take dramatic, once-and-for-all action to signal that the eurozone is safe. Obama knows that a Grexit (Greece leaving the eurozone) or an unravelling of the currency would decimate global growth and hammer the US economy \u2013 and hurt his re-election bid. But the American view of economic crisis management has been totally at odds with that of the Germans, who are minded to respond: where did the global financial crisis start anyway?</p>",
  "<p>Remember four years ago, when no Halloween party was complete without at least four ladies in updos, glasses and red pantsuits, claiming they were Sarah Palin? Or what about three years ago when everyone recycled those Palin wigs and we had more Snookis than a million episodes of Jersey Shore? Yes, such rampant uninspired dressing up is just dreadful.</p> <p>Guys do it too. In the past every gentleman of a certain cultural persuasion with a fake mustache dressed up as Borat. Then there was the year the city was under siege by a sea of Jokers from The Dark Knight (who were made even creepier by the fact that Heath Ledger had just passed). </p> <p>Yes, every year there are certain outfits that you just can't escape and every time you see one you just want to groan. Halloween is one of our more creative holidays, where people can express their individuality by dreaming that they are someone else. That individuality (and creativity) goes by the wayside when you're standing cheek to jowl at the punch bowl with seven people in the same regalia as you. </p> <p>I'm here to help. Here are a handful of costumes based on pop cultural phenomena, internet memes and topical comedy that have the potential to be the hit of the season. If you really want to stand out and wow the crowd, you're going to have to think of something else. (And no, it doesn't matter how well executed your costume is, if it's on the list, the volume of imitators will only detract from your hard work.)</p> <h2>The Ecce Homo Mural </h2> <p>Everyone had a good chuckle this summer where the pictures of a botched restoration of an Ecce Homo mural in Borja, Spain, <a href=\"www.guardian.co.uk/artanddesign/video/2012/aug/23/art-restorer-ecco-homo-mural-video\">surfaced on the internet</a>. That doesn't mean that we should all put on red robes and monkey masks and try to impersonate Cecilia Gimenez's handiwork. And if you think this is such a great idea, well, <a href=\"http://imgur.com/a/KxwHB#1x8wk\">someone already had it</a>, and he did a much better recreation than you can probably pull off. </p> <h2>An Olympian</h2> <p>There is nothing easier than putting on some sports kit, making a few medals out of ribbon and tin foil and calling yourself an Olympian. Since the fever of the London games has not entirely worn off, we're going to see plenty of people sporting Ryan Lochte's grill and McKayla Maroney's scowl on 31 October. Sure, there are plenty of demi-celebrities who ascended the medal stand for you to pick from, but you'll have a hard time sticking out no matter what you choose. However, if you have the body and youth to pull off Tom Daley in his Speedo, then no one will complain if you give it a whirl. </p> <h2>Honey Boo Boo</h2> <p>Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, the latest reality show that everyone thinks is sure to predict the downfall of our great civilization, is ripe for easy Halloween costumes. All it takes is a repurposing of that every-so-popular last minute dress-up idea of going as a \"white trash\" person or redneck and adding a topical spin. You'd be better off finding all the trash you have in your apartment, gluing it to some clothes and going as someone from Hoarders. Even if no one wants to stand next to you, at least you'll get points for originality. </p> <h2>Anything election-related</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398171819\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Politics/Pix/pictures/2012/10/19/1350662464458/Palin-Look-Alikes-Prepare-010.jpg\" alt=\"Palin \"Look-Alikes\" Prepare For Halloween\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Four Sarah Palins, Halloween 2008, San Francisco.

You might as well just wear a fedora, write \"PRESS\" on an index card and call yourself an olde-tyme reporter. What a snooze. I will give allowances for someone who dresses like a dog, straps himself to a car and goes as Mitt Romney's pooch, but finding a red tie and a free weight and going as Paul Ryan doing P90X takes no work at all. </p> <h2>Tan Mom </h2> <p>The charges against Patricia Krentcil for taking her young daughter into a tanning booth have <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/feedarticle/10227797\">long been dropped</a>, so maybe we should forget about this crazy internet personage for good. Some people might need to be reminded of her overly tanned hide even now, so just imagine how it's going to feel walking around a spooky party telling everyone, \"I'm Tan Mom, I'm Tan Mom!\" and trying to make it look like you're not trying to perpetrate some sort of latter-day blackface. You might even get yourself beat up by those who don't know what a Tan Mom is.</p> <h2>A Mormon</h2> <p>Maybe it's thanks to Mitt Romney's place in the election or the general rise of Mormonism in popular culture, but all men out there too lazy to think up a real costume need to know they can't keep dressing as a Mormon. I know it's easy to pull the short-sleeved white shirt out of our closet, put on a black tie, and formulate a little name tag. This is no longer cute. If you want to spend some time and get together a whole Joseph Smith look that's a different story but as Annie Lennox sang, don't mess with a missionary man. </p> <h2>Anything slutty</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-398171820\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Politics/Pix/pictures/2012/10/19/1350664212670/A-sexy-nurse.-Not-good.-010.jpg\" alt=\"A sexy nurse.

  "<p>On 4 June 2009 Barack Obama bounded on to the stage at Cairo University to deliver a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jun/04/barack-obama-keynote-speech-egypt?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">speech </a>which promised to seek&#xa0;\"a new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world\". It was, he said solemnly, a time of great&#xa0;tension.</p> <p>Speaking from a lectern set against a backdrop of plush red curtains, Obama sought to move beyond the toxic legacy of the 9/11 attacks, the US-led invasion of Iraq, the \"war on terror\" and the long and occasionally bloody impasse on the Palestinian issue.</p> <p>Expectations were enormous. Even at the time it was hard to imagine that this young African-American president with Muslim roots could meet them all. Still, Obama had opposed George Bush on Iraq and chided him for not doing enough to promote a just peace for the Palestinians \u2013 the two defining Middle Eastern issues of the preceding, turbulent years.</p> <p>The 55-minute speech was widely praised for its eloquence and ambition, but the reviews were mixed. For <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/jun/04/barack-obama-middleeast\" title=\"\">one commentator</a>, the key was to get beyond the courtesies \u2013 <em>mujamalat</em> in Arabic \u2013 to the beef. Honeyed words were welcome, went a typical response. But would actions follow? Was Obama really any more than \"a Bush in sheep's clothing\"?</p> <p>Now, as the end of his term nears, the answer is clear: Obama was different from his predecessor. Yet his record is as varied as the responses to the Cairo address. An extraordinary chain of unforeseen events \u2013 a hazard for any leader \u2013 has created new circumstances and new dilemmas.</p> <p>On Palestine, always a touchstone for Arabs and Muslims, Obama has been a grave disappointment. Having strikingly called the situation of the Palestinians \"intolerable\", he blinked first in the confrontation with Israel's prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, over whether settlements in the occupied territories would have to stop before peace talks could resume. US domestic politics interceded. Hopes of a two-state solution to the world's most intractable conflict are now fading fast.</p> <p>From the start, Obama reached out to Iran with a friendly message to its people and hints at flexibility in negotiations with its government. But his efforts to engage have failed, leading only to tougher sanctions and a covert war. Unless long-running diplomacy starts to work, a potentially catastrophic confrontation over its nuclear programme still looms.</p> <p>US troops have now left Iraq, but the country is racked by sectarianism and is not a reliable friend, its post-Saddam leaders in thrall to Tehran. On another post-9/11 front, US forces are beginning to wind down the war in Afghanistan. Obama has, though, escalated drone strikes against al-Qaida from Pakistan to Yemen. The killing of Osama bin Laden in his Abbotabad hideout was a national security triumph. Yet the dangers of jihadi violence, spreading to areas such as Somalia and the Maghreb, live on. The Guant\u00e1namo Bay detention centre, which Obama pledged to close, remains open \u2013 a stain on his record.</p> <p>In Cairo, Obama touched on the broad issue of political change in a sclerotic Arab world whose rulers sold themselves as guarantors of stability and western interests. That required an especially delicate balance. Watching as he spoke was Egypt's Hosni Mubarak, a US ally for whom democracy was a dirty word. And Obama had spent the previous night at the desert ranch of the octogenarian King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, the indispensable guardian of cheap western oil supplies.</p> <p>America, the president said, with a humble nod to these ageing Arab autocrats \u2013 and in a lightly coded reference to Bush's controversial \"freedom agenda\" \u2013 did \"not presume to know what is best for everyone\". But there was a bigger nod: \"I do have an unyielding belief that all people yearn for certain things: the ability to speak your mind and have a say in how you are governed; confidence in the rule of law and the equal administration of justice; government that is transparent and doesn't steal from the people; the freedom to live as you choose.\"</p> <p>Eighteen months later, the uprisings of the Arab spring tested that awkward construct. From the short and mostly peaceful revolution in Tunisia to carnage in Syria, Obama's responses have, as one admirer put it, mixed \"pragmatism and values\".</p> <p>Egypt's revolution provided the first hurdle. Obama was criticised for backing stability as the drama of Tahrir Square unfolded. But on 1 February came his call for Mubarak to step down \"now\". <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/25/us/politics/arab-spring-proves-a-harsh-test-for-obamas-diplomatic-skill.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\" title=\"\">As the New York Times wrote</a>: \"Obama upended three decades of American relations with its most stalwart ally in the Arab world, putting the weight of the United States squarely on the side of&#xa0;the Arab street.\"</p> <p>So when Mohamed Morsi, the Muslim Brotherhood leader who succeeded Mubarak to become Egypt's first democratically elected president, visited Washington last month \u2013 after demonstrations in Cairo and far beyond over a crude Islamophobic film \u2014 the tension was as obvious as the change was palpable. The US hope is that engagement, combined with the responsibility of exercising power, will encourage Islamist-led governments toward pragmatism.</p> <p>Libya's revolution illustrated Obama's ambivalent attitude to force and his reluctance to get involved in another war in a Muslim country. Washington \"led from behind,\" providing air power and intelligence but leaving it to Nato's European powers and their Arab allies to help overthrow Muammar Gaddafi. The brutal aftermath \u2013 in which jihadis killed the US ambassador in Benghazi \u2013 painfully underlined the dangers.</p> <p>Syria, the bloodiest front of the Arab spring, has been the biggest challenge. Obama demanded Bashar al-Assad's departure but resisted pressures to arm the opposition or impose a no-fly zone. Now anxiety is growing about the rise of jihadi-type groups and the \"blowback\" on the Gulf and the wider region.</p> <p>Obama has defended his record of supporting democratisation despite chaos and crises. \"It was absolutely the right thing for us to do to align ourselves with democracy, universal rights, a notion that people have to be able to participate in their own governance,\" <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/09/24/transcript-obama-on-60-minutes/\" title=\"\">he said on 60 Minutes</a> in September.</p> <p>Critics say that in trying to balance US national security with the promotion of democratic values and human rights, Obama has ducked hard choices. Shadi Hamid of the Brookings Institution characterises this stance as \"aggressive hedging,\" which has alienated both regimes and their opponents. \"Autocrats, particularly in the Gulf, think Obama naively supports Arab revolutionaries, while Arab protesters and revolutionaries seem to think the opposite,\" Hamid <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-01/hunt-for-obama-s-middle-east-policy-comes-up-empty.html\" title=\"\">said</a>.</p> <p>In Bahrain, on the sectarian divide between the Sunni and Shia worlds, home to the US fifth fleet and a key link in western defences against Iran, strategy and a Saudi veto trumped universal rights.</p> <p>Israel's close links with the US and worries about Iran have acted as a brake: a new tolerance of Islamists does not extend to the armed \"resistance\" movements \u2013 Lebanon's Hezbollah or Hamas in Palestine.</p> <p>\"Obama has successfully moved the US out of the ditch that George W Bush left the country in,\" Fawaz Gerges argued in a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Obama-Middle-East-Americas-Moment/dp/0230113818\" title=\"\">recent book</a>. \"But the test \u2026 will be whether or not he can realign US foreign policy with progressive and democratic voices in the region and translate his words into concrete policies.\"</p> <p>So to look back now to the uplifting rhetoric of June 2009 is to reflect on the gap between ambition and reality. Considering the choice between Obama and Romney, Arab political blog Awsaat offered only the weakest of support for the president who aroused such hopes when he spoke of that \"new beginning\" between America and Muslims. \"Although many of us are feeling disappointed with Obama's first term,\" it said, \"unfortunately we can choose between the bad we know or the worse we don't know.\"</p>",

  "<p>The Obama administration has moved quickly to water down a report that the US and Iran have agreed in principle to meet one-on-one for negotiations on Iran's nuclear programme.</p> <p>The New York Times said secret talks between officials that began early in Barack Obama's term as president had <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/21/world/iran-said-ready-to-talk-to-us-about-nuclear-program.html\">delivered the provisional agreement</a>. Iran had insisted the talks wait until after the November presidential election, the New York Times said, attributing the information to a senior official in the Obama administration.</p> <p>However the National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor said in response that the United States would continue to work with fellow permanent members of the UN security council and Germany. </p> <p>\"It's not true that the United States and Iran have agreed to one-on-one talks or any meeting after the American elections,\" the statement said.</p> <p>\"We continue to work with the P5+1 [five permanent members of the UN security council plus Germany] on a diplomatic solution and have said from the outset that we would be prepared to meet bilaterally.\"</p> <p>Vietor said on Saturday that Obama had made clear that he would do whatever was necessary to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. Vietor said Iran must meet its obligations or it would \"continue to face crippling sanctions and increased pressure\".</p> <p>Obama and the Republican presidential candidate, Mitt Romney, will meet on Monday night in a debate focusing on foreign policy. Iran's nuclear ambitions will likely be a topic.</p> <p>Obama has said he will prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. He hopes sanctions alongside negotiations can get Iran to halt uranium enrichment, but the strategy has not worked yet.</p> <p>Obama has held out the threat of military action as a last resort but Romney has accused Obama of being weak on Iran, saying the US needs to step up the military threat.</p>"
