  "<p>Democrats opened a fresh offensive on Mitt Romney's foreign policy Sunday, painting the Republican White House hopeful as a war-monger looking to take the US into further Middle East conflicts.</p> <p>Campaigning in Pennsylvania, vice president Joe Biden attacked Mr Romney's international agenda as laid out in last week's convention address, suggesting that it put him out of step with the US's priorities overseas.</p> <p>\"He said it was a mistake to end the war in Iraq and bring all of our warriors home. He said it was a mistake to set an end date for our warriors in Afghanistan and bring them home,\" Biden told supporters.</p> <p>He added: \"He implies by the speech that he's ready to go to war in Syria and Iran.\"</p> <p>The charge is a serious one in a country that has become less enthusiastic over foreign intervention as a result of more than a decade of conflict. It also suggests that Democratic strategists believe Obama can bolster his campaign by running on foreign policy, an area in which they believe he has a clear edge over his opponent.</p> <p>In past campaigns, the issue of international affairs has often been seen as a strong area for the Republicans.</p> <p>But Obama supporters point towards the end of conflict in Iraq and troop draw down in Afghanistan, as well as the assassination of terror chief Osama bin Laden, as evidence of the current administration's success overseas.</p> <p>In last week's speech in Tampa, Romney sought primarily to turn the screw on Obama over the issue of the economy.</p> <p>But in the parts of the address dedicated to foreign policy, the Republican presidential candidate struck out at the White House for not coming down hard enough on Iran, stating that \"every American is less secure today\" as a result of a perceived soft line on Tehran.</p> <p>He also criticised Obama directly for distancing America from traditional Middle East ally Israel and for his dealings with Russian president Vladimir Putin.</p> <p>\"Under my presidency, our friends will see more loyalty and Mr Putin will see a little less flexibility and more backbone,\" Romney told the party faithful.</p> <p>On the stump today, Biden hit back saying: \"He wants to move from co-operation to confrontation with Putin's Russia. And these guys say the president's out of touch?\"</p> <p>In a broad attack taking in criticism of Romney's personal tax arrangements, the vice president continued, according to a local ABC affiliate: \"Out of touch? Swiss bank account, untold millions in the Cayman Islands. Who's out of touch, man?\"</p> <p>Painting Romney's agenda as an out-of-date blueprint for America is becoming a theme of the Obama team's attack in the election run-up.</p> <p>Yesterday in the key battleground state of Iowa, a fired-up Obama called on American voters to back his plan to take the country forward.</p> <p>\"We have come too far to turn back now,\" he said at the start of a four-day tour of swing states leading up to a crucial set-piece address at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, North Carolina.</p> <p>He contrasted his platform with that of the Republican White House ticket, which he said was \"better suited for the last century\".</p> <p>Romney didn't offer \"a single new idea\" during Thursday's address in Tampa, the president said, adding: \"It was a rerun. We'd seen it all before, you might as well have watched it on a black-and-white TV.\"</p> <p>For his part, the Republican candidate - who delivered a competent speech in Tampa \u2013 spoke with more passion than is sometimes expected of him while campaigning Saturday in Ohio.</p> <p>To cheers of \"Mitt, Mitt, Mitt\", he promised to deliver a \"winning season\" for America, pledging that under his watch \"America is going to come roaring back\".</p> <p>He also tried to frame himself as a \"unity\" candidate, lambasting his opponent for \"divisiveness and bitterness\" on the campaign trail. \"I will bring us together,\" he told would-be voters in the state.</p> <p>But the Romney camp received a blow of sorts over the weekend with the suggestion that any bump resulting from the party's convention looks to be short lived.</p> <p>Having opened up a poll lead of a couple of points in the immediate aftermath of the Tampa get-together, a Reuters/Ipsos survey of voting intention put Obama back in front on Saturday night by the slenderest of margins \u2013 44% to Romney's 43%.</p> <p>As the run-down to the 6 November national ballot creeps closer, the Republicans are increasingly tying their hopes to focusing the electorate on a sluggish economic and a job market in which some 8.3% remain frozen out. They also have a clear edge when it comes to the money they have at their disposal to spend on attack ads.</p> <p>In contrast, Obama's strategists appear to be opting for a wider attack on the Republican Party's conservative social agenda and Romney's perceived weakness on matters of foreign policy. The addition of Paul Ryan to the White House ticket, as Romney's vice presidential pick, has opened up an additional avenue of attack for Obama along the lines of safeguarding Medicare from the Wisconsin representative's plan to turn the seniors' healthcare safety net into a voucher system.</p> <p>Moreover, at this week's convention, aides to the president will be hoping to counter some of the harm that could be inflicted as a result of their war-chest shortfall, by means of an Obama speech that could re-ignite a base that is seen to be less enthusiastic than it was four years ago.</p>",
  "<p>Barack Obama has a foe more potent than Mitt Romney. It is the younger version of himself. Scaremongering about a Republican candidate who will send America back to the age of black and white television will not be enough. Whining about the economic hand he was dealt will not do it either. George W Bush is history. His legacy \u2013 two wars and an global economic crash \u2013 may indeed have been so toxic that it would have taken all four of his successor's years to overcome, no matter who he was, but as we have charted in these columns, that is not the whole truth either. In important areas \u2013 Afghanistan and the drone war against al-Qaida to name but two \u2013 Obama continued all too consciously in Bush's footsteps.</p> <p>No, Bush is not Obama's problem. His own words and promises are, though. To get re-elected, Obama the president will have to prove how he can still keep faith with Obama the presidential candidate. He will have to make the account of the last four years more than just a<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-did-not-change-washington-for-each-side-its-clear-whos-to-blame/2012/09/01/a15265a0-f45b-11e1-adc6-87dfa8eff430_print.html\" title=\"\"> blame game</a>.</p> <p>The older and wiser man has several advantages over his younger self. He passed a tepid version of healthcare reform, but a reform nonetheless; he pulled out of Iraq; he prevented another great depression; he saved the car industry in Detroit. These are no mean achievements. But how much paler is the reality of power than the promise of it. As candidate, his rhetorical ambition knew no bounds, promising not just to change politics but energise a new generation. These people are now profoundly<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/01/barack-obama-fails-to-inspire-voters\" title=\"\"> de-energised</a>. If they are motivated, the urge is negative. They see, all too clearly, whom they are going to vote against \u2013 a rich man who will undo all the modest social democratic gains of the last four years, who as commander in chief will be drawn into a war with Iran. But they cannot as yet see whom they will be voting for.</p> <p>The candidate in 2008 was a brilliant electoral device. He was all things to all men \u2013 and women. Liberals saw in him a genuine radical. Centrists thought he could break the power of the Washington lobby. Climate change campaigners thought America would lead the search for Kyoto's successor, not block it. Everyone prayed Obama would restore America's tarnished global image, so that it could lead by force of argument rather than force of arms. Of course, this Icarus flew so high he was doomed to crash. But remember, too, the scale of his ambition. He set the bar for his leadership no lower than Abraham Lincoln himself.</p> <p>It has been such a bitter, personalised campaign that no candidate has even thought of making a major policy speech. It has all been attack ads, and there is much more to come. This week Obama will have to do better. He must provide people with a real reason, other than fear, to vote him in again.</p>",
  "<p>Naomi Wolf has been one of the world's most famous feminists for more than 20 years and she herself admits it is a very odd job. When she wrote <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2005/oct/18/classics.shopping\" title=\"\">The Beauty Myth</a> in 1991, she was 27 years old, enrolled on a PhD course and not intending to make her career in the field of feminist criticism. \"It's not a job that anyone had described as a possibility,\" she says and laughs. The success of that book, and the vitriol it attracted, launched her as a figure of some cultural import \u2013 part pop academic (she is just now getting around to finishing the PhD), part pundit and, more recently, part civil rights activist in the Occupy movement \u2013 and if she carries herself with a slight Joan of Arc air it is not without cause; public feminists don't, generally, attract the sanest mailbag. \"Oh, without doubt,\" says Wolf on the question of whether, when she writes about women, she gets a higher ratio of abuse than when she writes about anything else. \"So what?\"</p> <p>We are in New York, where Wolf lives with her two children and works between PhD commitments at Oxford. Her new book, Vagina, is attracting a lot of attention, not least for the title, a canny piece of marketing that she didn't hesitate to use, she says, \"because <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/jun/21/vagina-lisa-brown-michigan\" title=\"\">that word is either so taboo or surrounded with negative connotations or draped in shame or medicalised</a>, it's really important to take it back\". The book is part memoir, part cultural history and part scientific journey around women's sexuality, the best elements of which illuminate how little women generally know about their own anatomy \u2013 a kind of brainy sex manual \u2013 the worst of which founders on the kind of academic jargon Wolf is fond of, and that has to be squeezed hard to elicit much meaning. (Sample: \"... nor does this denial of the paradox of our feminine autonomy co-existing unsettledly with our feminine need for interdependence ...\")</p> <p>There is some discussion about what constitutes the \"female soul\". Looking back on a walk she took with a group of female scientists, Wolf recounts \"that slightly wild, slightly inexplicable moment \u2013 when the wind, the grass and the animals had all seemed a part of what we were learning about ourselves\". It's these kind of moments that have, over the years, contributed to a vague sense that while her heart is undoubtedly in the right place, Wolf is also full of hot air.</p> <p>So it is with Vagina, a generally noble enterprise to unshackle female sexual pleasure from millennia of cultural baggage by locating it in scientific fact \u2013 as she puts it, \"this amazing set of discoveries; this incredible, to me, revelatory science\". It all started with a problem Wolf was having in her own sex life; <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/the-womens-blog-with-jane-martinson/2012/aug/27/naomi-wolf-orgasms-vagina\" title=\"\">the quality of her orgasms suddenly changed</a> from being full of light and colour and what she describes in terms of transcendental experience, to something dull and lifeless. She went to see \"New York's pelvic nerve man\", which required a certain presence of mind. A lot of people in her place would have gone to see a psychotherapist.</p> <p>\"I'm not that crazy,\" she says. \"I knew that there was something physically wrong. It was physical. It was a physical experience.\"</p> <p>Wolf was absolutely right. The doctor diagnosed a mild form of spina bifida and told her that her spine, which was out of alignment, was compressing one branch of the pelvic nerve. He then explained to her the science of orgasm; that impulses from the pelvic nerve travelled up to the \"female brain\", or as she later summarised in the book, \"how the genitals connect to the lower spinal cord, which in turn connects to the brain\". This explained why she was suffering a lack of psychic as well as physical response during sex.</p> <p>\"I almost fell off the edge of the exam table in my astonishment,\" she writes. \"That's what explained vaginal versus clitoral orgasms? Neural wiring? Not culture, not upbringing, not patriarchy, not feminism, not Freud?\"</p> <p>She continues: \"I had never read that how you best reached orgasm, as a woman, was largely due to basic neural wiring.\"</p> <p>Wolf underwent an operation to put a metal plate in her back, after which, thankfully, all is well. But she has a profound new understanding of the way in which the vagina, in its hitherto underpublicised connection with the brain, \"mediates consciousness\".</p> <p>There will be many women (and men) whom this strikes at a less than revelatory level, not because it is common knowledge, but because it seems that every other week these days a book comes out ascribing various human states and behaviours \u2013 love/happiness/anger/addiction \u2013 to brain chemistry or neural wiring, accompanied by data from a scanner and a set of demoralised lab rats. The meaning of life might as well just be: neuroscience. So what?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-395507851\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/8/31/1346435420322/Wolf-is-arrested-in-New-Y-010.jpg\" alt=\"Wolf is arrested in New York during an Occupy Wall Street protest, October 2011.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wolf is arrested in New York during an Occupy Wall Street protest, October 2011. Photograph: Mike Shane </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Shane</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Well, says Wolf, her mission with the book was \"to get rid of that extra layer of shame and ignorance and confusion and blaming of the self for things that evolution or anatomy have constructed\". Since feminists \u2013 and anti-feminists \u2013 of yore spent so much time scrapping over the politics of female orgasm, it is useful to get the basic physiology down. \"Freud was wrong and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2011/may/13/shere-hite-film-feminist-sex\" title=\"\">Shere Hite</a> didn't have the whole picture, and the feminists of the 70s were waging a battle to prioritise the clitoris over the vagina that is actually beside the point, because every woman is wired differently,\" says Wolf. \"Why didn't they tell us in eighth grade? No one let us know. That whole revelation, about the neural system, and how complex it is, and its relationship to the spine and to the brain, was absolutely revelatory to me. It's changed my whole sense of how we're put together.\"</p> <p>All of which is good and sensible. But having taken politics out of the equation, Wolf then reintroduces them. Part of her investigation revolves around the various hormones and neurotransmitters activated in a woman's body during a \"successful\" sexual encounter, eg dopamine, \"which boosts the chemical construct of confidence, motivation, focus, all of these feminist qualities. Goal orientedness. Assertiveness\".</p> <p>In the book, she writes, \"dopamine is the ultimate feminist chemical in the female brain,\" a guffy-sounding PR line that sits awkwardly alongside the scientific language. Oxytocin, meanwhile \"is women's emotional superpower\". The vagina is \"not only coextensive with the female brain but also is part of the female soul\". And, finally, \"if femininity resided anywhere,\" writes Wolf, \"I would say it resides there, in that electric inward network extending from pelvis to brain\". (I'm not sure an abstract noun can reside anywhere. George Bush would be the one to ask).</p> <p>It's the kind of language to make scientists scream. I wonder if she hesitated to use terms such as \"soul\"?</p> <p>\"You're zeroing in on exactly the parts of the book that took the most care and struggle,\" she says. \"I know why it's risky to invoke that dimension or even that discourse. And that's why I was so careful in defining it so narrowly. There's this linear syllogism in the book. I'm not using that language without grounding it very carefully in the physical. <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/james/\" title=\"\">William James</a> said there are these transcendental experiences that many people had, and he got that from a lot of interviews. And then various neuroscientists have been mapping out where transcendence happens in the brain. One of my favourite quotes about the book is from a doctor that I had asked to read the manuscript, who, when I said something like \u2013 you know, we're just talking about states of consciousness \u2013 he said, but the only way we have of experiencing states of consciousness is in the physical, which doesn't make them less real.\"</p> <p>When Wolf was growing up in 70s San Francisco, the daughter of two academics, the kind of states of consciousness she writes about were frowned upon by many women activists as not feminist. Being in love, with its sense, as Wolf puts it, of \"longing, dependency, need\", was considered undermining of female independence. \"The discourse that I inherited,\" says Wolf, \"was like, you keep [these feelings] at a distance, don't acknowledge them, they're shameful, they're weaknesses. I always felt that that was buying into a sexist or traditionally masculinist view of human nature. And I thought, if women feel these things so regularly, it's not enough to say that it's just masochism.\"</p> <p>This was the era of a-woman-needs-a-man-like-a-fish-needs-a-bicycle, since when feminism has moved on. Nonetheless, there will be feminist critics who read her book and are alarmed by its essentialism; who receive her efforts to find a neurological definition of \"femininity\" \u2013 something they spent years arguing was mostly a cultural construct \u2013 as reductive and reactionary.</p> <p>\"I get it. And I know these schools of analysis and they're very very helpful conceptually, and in dealing with literature and philosophy. But they are being challenged all the time by what's going on in the labs. I saw rats \u2013 rats do not theorise their existence \u2013 behaving like female rats. You know? And again, there's space for many, many, many discourses in feminism.\"</p> <p>Which brings us (sort of) to \"cuntini\". One of the interesting things Wolf looks into is the way in which sexualised language is used to demoralise women who achieve power in male-dominated worlds. Most women know this from experience; that sexual insult is the quickest and commonest way to undermine them and that men \u2013 online, on the street \u2013 use it all the time. I'm sure Wolf has come in for a tonne of it. But there is a scene in the book that suggests she has crossed into territory where it is difficult for the rest of us to follow. With her trademark tone of more in sorrow than in anger, Wolf tells the story of a party her friend Alan threw her, in celebration of Vagina finding a publisher. As a joke, Alan said he was going to make vagina-shaped pasta, which he did. When, in front of guests, he referred to it as \"cuntini\", Wolf was so horrified, so traumatised by his language, that, she writes, she suffered six months of writer's block.</p> <p>One understands that \"lighten up, love\" is the stock misogynist response to women protesting male aggression. But this seems an extraordinary reaction to a \u2026</p> <p>\"Party?\" says Wolf.</p> <p>Yeah.</p> <p>\"I mean. You know. I'm not sure what your question is?\"</p> <p>It's hard to understand how she can have had such a reaction to a bit of a shit joke, but not that bad a joke.</p> <p>\"Well, that's a good question.\" She looks very much as if she does not consider this a good question. \"You know, one never understands everything about one's insufficiencies and incapacities, but I know that I was nervous [about the book]. I'm not now, because there are enough readers who've said, wow, this is really valuable to me. But at that time, I hadn't written the book yet and I was scared by the taboo around it. And scared that there would be a very public backlash; that I'd be punished.\"</p> <p>She cites the contagious diseases acts of 19th-century Britain, which allowed the state to round up prostitutes and women judged to be promiscuous for mandatory VD testing and subsequent imprisonment. \"Which, believe it or not, is I think actually a major trauma in western women's psyches \u2013 that oh my God, if I'm sexual or if I own my sexuality in some public way, a terrible thing will happen to me. For a while, thousands of women were rounded up because they were overtly sexual and incarcerated for up to nine months. And I do think there are such things as culturally traumatic moments that get passed down.</p> <p>\"So it was scary to think: I'm going to write this book and put my name on it and send it out there and something terrible will happen. So then when, in my circle, there was this publicly humiliating thing [cuntini], I don't know if there was a cause/effect and that's why I couldn't write, but I know I couldn't write for quite a while after that. Again, these are very intuitive connections, so I can't say this silenced me. But it reinforced the idea that something bad would happen.\"</p> <p>It's not that this isn't credible so much that Wolf can't, apparently, hear how it plays; or how a wry acknowledgment of its absurdity might get her further. It's the same tonal deafness that characterises her description of a man from Chalk Farm, north London, in whom she puts a great deal of store, a \"bodyworker\" who attempts, through massage, to re-engage sexually traumatised women and who, Wolf relates in the book with a straight face, once saw an image of the Virgin Mary in a vagina.</p> <p>Now that she is working on civil liberties, life has become slightly easier. She has a big following, with fewer crazies in the mix. <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/oct/19/naomi-wolf-arrest-occupy-wall-street\" title=\"\">After being arrested in New York last year during an Occupy protest</a>, Wolf found herself in the public eye as a hero. (She was informing protesters of their legal rights to demonstrate peacefully, without being rounded up by police, who arrested her.) It was, she says, a frightening experience. \"They took us from the precinct where our lawyers were waiting, to an undisclosed location across town where no one knew where we were. We were looking at 15 days in Rikers Island if we were found guilty, which is a very violent place. Where all bets are off. I think everyone in Britain and America should be very concerned about protecting due process.\"</p> <p>She is hugely disappointed in Obama on this front. \"Oh my God. He prosecutes whistleblowers, he keeps Guant\u00e1namo open, he allowed the department of homeland security to put military equipment in police stations across the country which they then used against protesters. He has been worse than Bush for civil liberties.\"</p> <p>Can she still vote for him? \"I try not to say who I'm voting for because I try not to endorse.\" But, she says, \"people like Cameron and Obama and Romney to some extent are \u2013 minor differences.\"</p> <p>She will continue campaigning, through her journalism, her advocacy and her \"democracy-building\" website. Meanwhile, Vagina will probably cause a fuss in the kind of places where everything causes a fuss; a few bookstores will refuse to put it in the window, and Wolf will be reassured, as she must, of the power of her taboo-breaking.</p>",
  "<p>Mitt Romney failed to achieve a bounce from the Republican convention, according to a poll published Sunday, lifting Democrats' spirits as they arrived in Charlotte for their own gathering.</p> <p>Although Obama's campaign team played down the chances of Obama securing a poll bounce from the Democratic convention, beginning Tuesday, it is privately hoping he can open up a significant lead after months in which the two have been tied in the polls. The White House election is on 6 November.</p> <p>Television coverage of conventions usually guarantees a poll bump, but the Republican convention was disrupted by hurricane Isaac, and the convention itself was relatively subdued.</p> <p>Polls put Romney ahead by two percentage points on Thursday and, after delivering a competent but uninspired speech on Thursday evening, one point on Friday.</p> <p>By yesterday, a Reuters/Ipsos tracking poll showed Obama with a narrow lead, 44% to 43%.</p> <p>But Obama faces his own problems this week, with his own convention cut down from four days to three because of a cash shortage, unhappiness among the party's main financial backers \u2013 the unions \u2013 and widespread disillusionment with his presidency.</p> <p>Furthermore, like the Republicans last week, he is facing problems with the weather.</p> <p>Six things to watch for this week:</p> <h2>1. Obama's stadium appearance.</h2> <p>Thunderstorms are forecast for Charlotte this week, which shouldn't be a problem Tuesday and Wednesday when the convention is being held indoors. </p> <p>But the weather could be a problem on Thursday, when Obama is scheduled to end with a rally at the 73,000-seat Bank of America stadium.</p> <p>Bank of America itself is an unfortunate name to be associated with, given the unpopularity of bankers, but the Democrats have yet another problem.</p> <p>The big question is whether Obama still has the drawing power that he had in 2008 to fill the stadium. Republicans question whether he is capable of it, suggesting the stadium smacks of delusions of grandeur, just like the Greek columns backdrop he used for his 2008 Denver convention speech, also in a stadium.</p> <p>The Democratic organisers were unequivocal this weekend, insisting that it will be filled to capacity, and that, in the event of rain, they have a contingency plan.</p> <p>\"We're confident we'll be full,\" Jen Psaki, an Obama spokeswoman, told the Hill magazine. \"We have a great ground operation in North Carolina and we've registered more voters than any other state. Our goal is to leave North Carolina better than we came in.\"</p> <h2>2. Bill Clinton's keynote speech.</h2> <p>Other than Obama's speech formally accepting the party's presidential nomination, the main attraction among the speakers will be Bill Clinton's keynote address on Wednesday night.</p> <p>The former president, still one of the best-loved figures in the Democratic party and one of the best orators in US politics, had harsh words for Obama during the 2008 Democratic primaries and caucuses, and he has a tendency to say \u2013 at least sometimes \u2013 what he really thinks when questioned by journalists.</p> <p>But the former president is also a party loyalist, meaning he will almost certainly praise Obama. He also has a personal interest in winning over the convention, preparing the ground for another possible run by wife Hillary Clinton in 2016.</p> <p>He remains one of the best political orators in the world, and could help lift Democrats who feel Obama has not done enough.</p> <h2>3. Other speakers.</h2> <p>Apart from Clinton, speakers who will attract attention during the week include First Lady Michelle Obama, Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel, former presidential candidate John Kerry, San Antonio mayor Julian Castro, and, via a video link, former president Jimmy Carter.</p> <p>There will be a lot of media attention around Charlie Crist, the former Republican governor of Florida who has switched sides to back Obama. There will be a lot of media interest too in Sandra Fluke, the student denounced as \"a slut\" by conservative talk-show host Rush Limbaugh when, in testimony to Congress, she spoke about the availability of contraception. She is to deliver a speech from the platform, a chance to highlight differences between the Democrats and Republicans in their approach to women's rights.</p> <p>There is a slot too for Elizabeth Warren, fighting to win back from Republican Scott Brown the Massachusetts senate seat once held by Ted Kennedy. A victory for her could help the Democrats retain senate control.</p> <h2>4. Unions unhappy with North Carolina.</h2> <p>Tampa turned out to be a bad choice for the Republicans, given it was the middle of the hurricane season. Charlotte too is a gamble for the Democrats and, like Tampa, may turn out to be a mistake. The thinking was that North Carolina, though it went to Obama in 2008, was an extremely close race, and that holding the convention in Charlotte would help buttress Democratic chances in November.</p> <p>Since the decision was made, polls show North Carolina has returned to the Republican fold and is no longer regarded as a toss-up state.</p> <p>Furthermore, Charlotte could be a mistake \u2013 even though it seems to be a more pleasant place to visit than Tampa \u2013 because the decision has angered unions.</p> <p>North Carolina is a 'right-to-work' state, one of those that introduced legislation that severely restricts union rights. The unions have scaled back their involvement in the convention, abandoning most of the rallies, parties, concerts and other events they fund, and only sending small delegations.</p> <p>Richard Trumka, leader of one of the biggest union groups, the AFL-CIO, in a letter to other union officials, wrote: \"We will not be making major monetary contributions to the convention or the host committee for events or activities around the convention.\" The money would be channelled instead to political grassroots activities elsewhere.</p> <h2>5. Disillusionment among party activists.</h2> <p>There is disillusionment too among the party grassroots, where a feeling persists that Obama should have done more during his first term, especially in the first year when the Democrats controlled both the Senate and the House.</p> <p>These activists are disappointed that he has not fulfilled campaign promises such as the closure of the Guantanamo Bay detention center.</p> <p>The question this week is how many people are prepared to go out and work for Obama \u2013 knocking on doors, canvassing, and otherwise getting the vote out.</p> <p>The Republicans are banking on more of their base being fired up than that of the Democrats. They might prove right, but it could also be that Democrats will be sufficiently motivated by the prospect of a Romney presidency to come out anyway.</p> <p>Events in Charlotte may help demonstrate how widespread the disaffection is among the party grassroots.</p> <h2>6. Public disenchantment with Obama's presidency.</h2> <p>Beyond avowed Democrats, there is a wider disenchantment among voters. </p> <p>The biggest issue among the electorate is the sluggish economy, with unemployment stuck at just over 8%.</p> <p>No matter how good a week Obama has in Charlotte, the latest unemployment figures come out the morning after his convention speech, and economists are not expecting any major positive change.</p>",
  "<p>When Republican vice-presidential candidate Paul Ryan <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/80423.html\" title=\"\">closed his speech at the Republican National Convention in Tampa</a> last week with the emphatic incantation \"let's get this done!\", the inner pentagram of the Republican party was on its feet cheering its approval.</p> <p>Cut back to the CNN studio where anchor Wolf Blitzer noted how enthusiastic the delegates seemed, although he also noted there were one or two items the fact-checkers might want to come back on. He had, he said, made a list of \"seven or eight points\" that might be contentious, but didn't mention what they were. Cut to a panel discussion for instant reaction, cut to Ryan and family looking pleased, cut back to the studio. Still no specifics on those pesky facts.</p> <p>Meanwhile Democrats and those with reasonable knowledge of US politics were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/30/paul-ryans-speech-audacious-untruths?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">furiously filling the internet with accusations that the speech was at best disingenuous, at worst deliberately misleading</a>. What about the car plant Ryan referred to \u2013 mocking Obama for talking about it lasting 100 years, yet it was closed within a year of his becoming president \u2013 when the Bush administration had closed it? Or chiding Obama for failing to act on a fiscal report when Ryan himself had sat on the committee which blocked the adoption of its recommendations ? Or his Medicaid calculations?</p> <p>Back in the CNN studio, Blitzer finally felt comfortable listing the points where Ryan had clearly created a misleading impression, noting that \"emails and Twitter\" had raised such questions, rather than producers and correspondents. For the viewer, it was puzzling.</p> <p>A major news network that doesn't say, even as the ovation continues, \"hang on a minute\", is surely falling short. The reluctance of American journalists to tackle the substantive issues raised by politicians, lobbyists, pressure groups and others for fear of being seen as \"biased\" forms part of a culture of \"neutrality\" that is essentially driven by economic forces but which is presented as an ethical touchstone.</p> <p>\"The view from nowhere\" is a phrase coined by philosopher Thomas Nagel, which was applied to American journalism by academics and commentators like Jay Rosen and James Fallows. It describes a flawed process of delivering \"unbiased\" reporting. The \"neutral\" journalist conveys two sides to an argument without forming a judgment. The theory sounds fine until you try it out: \"some scientists believe in the Darwinian theory of evolution, but many other people believe that God created men and monkeys from different pieces of magic clay'. An extreme, and absurd example perhaps, but one which illustrates the fundamental bankruptcy of \"the view from nowhere\".</p> <p>The culture that favours \"neutrality\" over \"truthiness\" was illustrated by Republican Senate candidate Todd Akin's now infamous assertion that \"legitimate rape\" carries almost no risk of pregnancy, when his interviewer Charles Jaco allowed it to slip by unchallenged. Again, this local interview rapidly found an international audience through the hyper-connected web of consumers and commentators, making the journalistic failure to tackle this at source even more egregious.</p> <p>The existence of a \"fact-checking movement\" which runs parallel to, but is not part of, the press shows how disjointed the process of informing the public has become. So much so that a former public editor of the New York Times attracted some ridicule earlier this year when he asked if it was the job of journalists to be \"truth vigilantes\".; given the prevailing conditions, however, one can see why he was asking the question even it if was phrased in a rather unfortunate way.</p> <p>Every one of the 15,000 editors, correspondents, producers, gofers and commentators who packed into the convention last week should be asking themselves the same question. If the job of journalism is to strengthen democracy, and if you can't move in downtown Tampa for accredited press, why did Ryan and his team of speechwriters produce something so wilfully misleading? The ugly truth is, they did it because they could.</p>",
  "<p>A new Socialist president and a freshly appointed leftwing government have not made the French especially happy, according to a poll that found two-thirds are pessimistic about the future.</p> <p>In the latest of a series of surveys carried out three months after Fran\u00e7ois Hollande won office, 68% of those asked said they were worried for themselves and their family.</p> <p>The level of Gallic gloominess comes close to the all-time high \u2013 or low \u2013 recorded in 2005 shortly after Jacques Chirac was elected for a second term in office, when the pessimism was shared by 70% of people. Hollande's predecessor as president, the right-of-centre Nicolas Sarkozy, made only 50% of French people fearful for the future.</p> <p>Dimanche Ouest France, the newspaper that commissioned the survey, said 2005 was a \"historic peak of measured pessimism\" and that those with the most bleak outlook were those over 65 years old, small businessmen and women and the unemployed. The most cheerful, it declared, were labourers. \"It's the first time that concern is so high at the start of a presidential mandate,\" the pollsters Ifop reported.</p> <p>It is not only opposition voters who see dark clouds ahead: 58% of Socialist party supporters said they had found little comfort in having the left in power for the first time in 15 years.</p> <p>A separate survey published a week ago found that Hollande's approval rating had steadily declined since his election victory in May, to 54%. The Socialist government has been hit by a 13-year high in unemployment and the announcement of widespread redundancies at Peugeot and the supermarket chain Carrefour.</p>",
  "<p>It probably didn't make his day, but Barack Obama appears to harbour no grudge against Clint Eastwood for the actor's bizarre attack on him during the Republican National Convention.</p> <p>In an interview with USA Today, the president diplomatically referred to the ageing Hollywood legend as a \"great actor, and an even better director\".</p> <p>As to whether he had been offended by the 12-minute improvised address - during which Eastwood chastised an invisible Obama sat in an empty chair - the White House incumbent seemed to brush the incident aside.</p> <p>\"One thing about being president or running for president \u2013 if you're easily offended, you should probably choose another profession,\" he told the newspaper.</p> <p>The use of Eastwood was intended to inject a bit of Hollywood glamour into the Republican National Convention in Tampa last week.</p> <p>Instead, it left aides to presidential nominee Mitt Romney reportedly pointing fingers at each other as the blame game began over who authorised the shambling performance.</p> <p>The appearance of the star of Dirty Harry had been nodded through by senior staff.<br> But according to an article Sunday in the New York Times, the actor ignored the time limit they set him.</p> <p>The use of a chair as a prop was also reportedly sprung upon them at the last minute, by Eastwood himself.</p> <p>\"The prop person probably thought he was going to sit on it,\" the New York Times quotes a \"baffled\" Romney aide as saying.</p> <p>During the actor's slot, an imaginary Obama was berated by Eastwood over the decision to go into Afghanistan, despite it being his predecessor George W Bush who sent troops into the conflict.</p> <p>The 82-year-old star also alluded to imagined profanities uttered by the silent and invisible president.</p> <p>\"What do you want me to tell Romney?\" he asked the empty chair, adding: \"I can't tell him that. He can't do that to himself.\"</p> <p>The crowd laughed, but behind the scenes, others cringed.</p> <p>Putting on a brave face following the incident, the line coming out of many Republicans was that it was just Clint being Clint.</p> <p>Ann Romney, whose own tribute at the convention to her husband Mitt was well-received, described Eastwood as a \"unique guy\" doing a \"unique thing\".</p> <p>According to his interview with USA Today, it appears that Obama is erring against the idea of inviting a similarly loose cannon to address this week's Democratic National Convention.</p> <p>\"I think we'll be playing this pretty straight,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>Liberal Democrats have warned Nick Clegg he could be ousted as leader before the next general election amid growing concerns over the party's declining support.</p> <p>Lib Dem MP Adrian Sanders, a former aide to Paddy Ashdown, said the deputy prime minister needed to stop \"just bumbling along worrying about the future\" and take action to rebuild support for the party, he told the Sunday Times.</p> <p>His comments were echoed by the Lib Dem peer, Lord Smith of Clifton, who warned Clegg he was not \"indispensable\" and could be replaced by the business secretary, Vince Cable.</p> <p>Smith, a former politics professor, is the second Lib Dem peer in a week to question Clegg's leadership.</p> <p>He told the paper the deputy prime minister was \"just a cork bobbing on the waves\" with \"no strategic vision at all\".</p> <p>\"It's not as if Clegg is indispensable. Vince Cable possesses the appeal and the credibility to lead the Liberal Democrats into the next election,\" he said.</p> <p>Andrew Bridgwater, the vice-chairman of Devon and Cornwall regional party and chairman of the Lib Dem education association, went further, calling on Clegg to depart. \"The sooner Nick resigns and creates a vacancy for Vince, the better,\" he told the Independent on Sunday.</p> <p>\"To put it bluntly, I would encourage Vince Cable to stand for the leadership to take us into the next election.\"</p> <p>Senior activists have accused Clegg of failing to stand up for the party's interests on tax, education, electoral reform, the NHS and Europe.</p> <p>Another activist, Charles West, the chairman of Shrewsbury and Atcham Lib Dems, told the paper Clegg must \"justify\" his decisions in government over the next two years or be at risk from a leadership challenge.</p> <p>The comments come as a YouGov poll showed 47% of Lib Dem voters think the party would fare better if they ditched Clegg before the next general election.</p> <p>Former Liberal Democrat voters, who have abandoned the party since it went into coalition with the Tories in 2010, are most strongly in favour of dropping Clegg, with 63% saying the party would do better without him.</p> <p>Last week, one of Cable's closest allies, Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay, warned the Lib Dems may need to consider a change of \"management and strategy\" because the party had seen its support halve since the election.</p> <p>Oakeshott, a persistent critic of Clegg, advises Cable on an informal but regular basis but his remarks prompted warnings by senior Lib Dems that the business secretary is one of two cabinet ministers making plans to succeed Clegg. Another source said Ed Davey, the energy and climate secretary, is also manoeuvring to oust Clegg, but the MP himself has dismissed the claim.</p>"
