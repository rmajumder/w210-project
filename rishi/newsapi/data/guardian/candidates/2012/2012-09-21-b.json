  "<p>Mitt Romney bowed to sustained pressure from the Democrats on Friday by <a href=\"http://www.mittromney.com/disclosure\">releasing a summary of his tax returns</a> for the last two decades. </p> <p>The summary shows that, contrary to suspicions voiced by the Democrats that he was hiding his returns because he had paid no taxes some years, he and his wife Ann paid federal and state income tax every year since 1990. </p> <p>Their average federal tax rate over that period was 20.2% and at no time dropped below 13.6%, according to the summary prepared by his accountants PriceWaterhouseCoopers.</p> <p>But it will not satisfy the Democrats who will focus on many remaining unanswered questions. They will continue to press him to release his full tax returns going back at least five years, question him over his use of offshore tax havens and investigate further Bain Capital, the investment company where he made his fortune.</p> <p>Brad Woodhouse, a Democratic national committee spokesman, wrote on Twitter: \"Summaries? What is Romney hiding? This isn't just abt rates \u2014 how about Swiss Bank Accts, Bermuda Shell Cos and Caymans Investments?\"</p> <p>Romney, as he promised earlier this year he would do, also released Friday his tax return for 2011 in which he paid $1.9m, a tax rate of 14.1% on an income of $13.7m, mainly from investments. The top rate of income tax is 35% but Romney's income is mainly from investments, which attracts a 15% rate.</p> <p>The couple paid more than $4m, about 30% of their income, to charity. They also, unusually, limited the amount they could claim as a tax deduction on charitable givings.</p> <p>In August, Romney said he had paid at least 13% in taxes in each of the last 10 years. His campaign team said his tax bill for 2011 would have been higher but, in order to comply with the 13% comment, the Romneys limited the amount they could have deducted from the charitable contributions.</p> <p>Earlier this year, he released his tax returns for 2010, mainly as a result of criticism from Republican opponents during the hard-fought primary season that he had not released any. At the time, he promised he would release his 2011 returns too.</p> <p>The rates paid by the Romneys, who have an estimated fortune of more than $200m, are much lower than many low- or middle-income families.</p> <p>He had repeatedly refused to follow the convention set by previous White House challengers in releasing multiple tax returns, including his own father George, who released 12 years' worth during the 1968 Republican presidential campaign. Obama has also released 12 years' worth of tax returns.</p> <p>Publication of some of his tax details comes at the end of a week which has been the candidate's worst period on the campaign trail, dominated by the release of a secret video of a speech behind-closed-doors in Florida in May. </p> <p>In the speech, he portrayed 47% of the American population as freeloaders, dependent on federal government help, who pay no tax and who vote for Barack Obama.</p> <p>The senate majority leader Harry Reid, in an interview in July, said he had heard from a source that the reason Romney refused to release his tax returns was because he had not paid any for a decade. An ad paid for by the Obama campaign also questioned whether he had paid any taxes at all.</p> <p>Discussing his tax returns in January, Romney said: \"I pay all the taxes that are legally required and not a dollar more. I don't think you want someone as the candidate for president who pays more taxes than he owes.\"</p> <p>Romney's running-mate, Paul Ryan, released his 2011 tax return earlier this year, paying $65,000 on $323,416 in income, a 15% rate.</p> <p>A doctor's letter released by the Romney campaign alongside his tax return confirms he is in good health. It records the usual details about his diet, heart rate and tablets to lower his cholesterol and low-dosage aspirin in hopes of reducing the chance of a heart attack. </p> <p>But the doctor goes beyond that to make what almost sounds like a political broadcast.</p> <p>\"He has shown the ability to be engaged in multiple, varied, simultaneous activities requiring complex mental, social, emotional and leadership skills.\"</p> <p>The doctor, Randall Gaz, goes on to say: \"He is a vigorous man who takes excellent care of his physical health. He has reserves of strength, energy and stamina that provide him with the ability to meet unexpected demands. There are no physical impairments that should interfere with his rigorous and demanding political career as the next president of the United States.\"</p> <p>Ryan's doctor, Timothy Kronquist, said the candidate's overall health was excellent. \"You have practised important preventive lifestyle choices to include regular vigorous aerobic and strength-building exercises, a heart healthy diet, smoking abstinence and infrequent alcohol use.\"</p>",
  "<p>\u2712 I feel sorry for Nick Clegg, who is a decent man. People always bang on about how politicians should be straight with us and admit their failings, but as soon as he does, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/shortcuts/2012/sep/20/nick-clegg-apology-video-parodies\" title=\"\">he becomes the subject of yet more ridicule</a>. I fear a tipping point has been reached, as it often does with politicians. John Major was thought hopelessly dull and incompetent, and it's only 15 years later that he has some kind of reputation restored. John Prescott is still locked into the buffoon stage, and may never recover even if he becomes a police commissioner. Now there is nothing Clegg can do. He could produce a dazzling plan that saved the British economy, win Olympic gold, or rescue three children from a blazing building. But he would still be a figure of fun, and remain so for another decade.</p> <p>\u2712 As my colleague Stephen Bates pointed out, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/19/papyrus-jesus-wife-academic-debate?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">the scrap of papyrus scroll with the line \"Jesus said to them, 'my wife'</a>\u2026\" does sound like the beginning of a joke, possibly by Henny Youngman, the British-born American comedian famous for one-liners about wives. \"Jesus said: 'Someone stole my credit cards. I'm not reporting it \u2013 the thief spends less than my wife!'\"</p> <p>Or, \"And Jesus said unto them, 'my wife just spent two hours in the beauty parlour. And that was just for the estimate'.\" Or, \"Verily, brethren, I take my wife everywhere. But she keeps finding her way back!\" It would have perked up Sunday school no end.</p> <p>\u2712 Like any average pervert, I've been pondering the Duchess of Cambridge's breasts this week, and the fact that these days it's rare to see any member of the royal family who's not naked. I was reminded of the old Dennis Pennis gag about Demi Moore: \"If it wasn't gratuitous in any way and it was tastefully done, would you consider keeping your clothes on in a movie?\"</p> <p>I spent long enough on the internet to find the cover of the French magazine that first aired the breasts, and of course they were as blurry as you'd expect from a picture taken half a mile away. And not remotely sexy. If it's pert, colourful, non-pixillated bosoms you want, then page 3 of the Sun is far more rewarding \u2013 though the whole point about their young women is that they look innocent rather than alluring, rather as if they're saying, \"oops, you just caught me sunbathing in the garden; I'll pop inside and put something on.\"</p> <p>Topless Kate isn't about sex at all but about intrusion, a sense of invading the privacy of the rich, famous and powerful, a feeling that you are getting one over those set above us. In the same way no one could find the internet shots of Britney Spears's knickers arousing, just humiliating for her, and unpleasantly, secretly rewarding for us.</p> <p>\u2712 Last week I mentioned how <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2012/sep/15/us-election-obama-romney\" title=\"\">Stephen Pile had identified James William Davison, who edited the magazine Musical World in Victorian times, as the worst ever music critic</a>. He excoriated, among others, Tchaikovsky, Verdi, Wagner, Chopin, Berlioz, Schumann and Schubert, saving his praise only for one man whose fame would be celebrated by posterity: William Sterndale Bennett.</p> <p>Like most people I had never heard of Sterndale Bennett, but Guardian readers are fantastically knowledgeable, and Jeremy Beecham emailed almost immediately to say that he had two Sterndale Bennett CD's in his car and enjoyed listening to them.</p> <p>And not only is he recorded on CD but you can buy them! Which I did, and am listening to his first piano concerto as I write. It's not bad at all and even pleasantly melodic \u2013 he is no musical McGonagall. But like so much derivative music, you do have the feeling, as you listen for the first time, that you have heard it all before.</p> <p>\u2712 I see that someone in Scotland has applied to the EU this week for <a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/quality/schemes/index_en.htm\" title=\"\">protected designation of origin</a> (PDO) for the deep-fried Mars bar, so it would be on a level with champagne and Cornish pasties. A joke, I assume, since Mars bars are not lovingly handmade in Scotland, but that hasn't stopped various Scots from defending the delicacy, largely on the grounds that it is honest working-class fare and only English snobs mock it.</p> <p>I don't myself, having had a classy version in a London restaurant \u2013 the Mars bar was sliced in half lengthwise, then fried in crisp filo pastry and dusted with icing sugar. It was delicious. I think what people south of the border don't comprehend is the \"Mars bar supper\", which includes the battered confectionery served with chips. You can also get the Jaffa cake supper, and the Cadbury's creme egg supper. I'd love a PDO meal served in a Michelin-starred eatery, including foie gras de Strasbourg, poulet de Bresse polished off with a Snickers supper.</p> <p>\u2712I taped an edition of Private Passions for Radio 3 this week (out soon, if you're interested and if they think it's worth broadcasting). No Sterndale Bennett sadly, but I chose an aria by Donizetti. The composer Michael Berkeley, who presents the programme, told me about a distant edition of My Music, which included John Amis and Frank Muir. Amis said that it was believed Donizetti had died of excessive self-abuse. \"Ah,\" said Muir, \"you might say that he died by his own hand.\"</p> <p>The outraged BBC refused to broadcast the whole programme, and only relented much later when they aired it, without the offending lines. I doubt that would happen now.</p> <p>\u2712On my way to Michael Berkeley's home in Notting Hill I passed a street sweeper, for whom I felt sorry \u2013 you just knew his annual wages would barely buy a square foot of floor space in one of those huge houses.</p> <p>He was in an altercation, because I heard him yelling down his phone, \"don't give me that fucking [bad word] you fucking [even worse word], fuck you,\" and so on for two or three minutes as I passed. I looked back and saw on his hi-vis jacket the words: \"Love the streets you live in.\"</p>",
  "<p>Lord Fink, the Tory donor (ennobled 2011) and party treasurer, who succeeded to the post after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/mar/25/tory-cash-access-party-funding\" title=\"\">Peter Cruddas was caught out offering meetings with David Cameron for donations of up to \u00a3250,000</a>, has revealed that he asked <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/20/tory-treasurer-make-uk-tax-haven?newsfeed=true\" title=\"\">George Osborne to make Britain more like a tax haven</a>, so we, er, don't lose jobs to other tax havens, because everyone knows that Guernsey is an economy that dwarfs all others.</p> <p>What Fink means, I suspect, is that Britain should be more like a tax haven so he doesn't lose money to anything as morally perverse as a tax system. This is the neoliberal cure for the problem of tax havens, and it makes sense if you love money and hate people. Make everywhere a tax haven. This, in the government's exhausted social equality jargon, could even be called \"fair\".</p> <p>Not that Osborne agreed with Fink. We know what the chancellor thinks of tax avoidance, because he was moved to comment on it even before the comic <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2012/jun/21/jimmy-carr-apologises-error-tax\" title=\"\">Jimmy Carr was exposed as a tax avoider</a> in June and instantly stopped being funny. In his budget speech Osborne denounced \"tax evasion and indeed aggressive tax avoidance as morally repugnant\". Morally repugnant? Are you sure? I thought it was welfare recipients, with their pesky need for food and healthcare and jobs (see the whispered philosophising of Mitt Romney) who are morally repugnant; you would certainly think so, from the number of briefings from civil servants hitting the tabloids, moaning about immigrants living in mansions and laughing at the \"squeezed middle\".</p> <p>Other ministers sing the anti-tax avoidance song \u2013 Danny Alexander, Vince Cable, even the prime minister, whose <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/apr/20/cameron-family-tax-havens\" title=\"\">private fortune was enhanced by careful investment in tax havens</a>, courtesy of his late father. But while welfare scrounging is morally repugnant enough to act on, tax avoidance, it seems, is not \u2013 you can endorse it, and still be Lord Fink (ennobled 2011) and party treasurer. Nothing changes, which makes me wonder if the only person in government telling the truth is Francis Maude who, when accused of trying to turn Britain into a tax haven by a Labour MP 20 years ago, said: \"Thank you very much, I appreciate the compliment.\" This is an <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9189492/Its-a-compliment-to-be-a-tax-haven-says-Francis-Maude.html\" title=\"\">anecdote he tells journalists</a>, so he must think it makes him sound wonderful.</p> <p>No one is sure quite how much revenue is lost to tax havens and complex avoidance schemes because invisible money is hard to count. You are more likely to see the tax gap wandering down Bond Street than find a note of it in a drawer at HM Revenue and Customs. The Treasury says that almost 14% of the UK tax gap is due to legal tax avoidance. The Times put it at \u00a35bn a year in an investigation this week, with at least \u00a31bn being lost to British citizens living in Monaco, if you can call it living.</p> <p>Of six Monaco-based donors to \u2013 surprise! \u2013 the Tory party, one, David Instance, lent Cameron a helicopter in his leadership campaign, so he could fly to meetings and harm the world, like James Bond in reverse. I have seen Monaco; it is all street signs pointing at Prada, billionaires cruising, as if on spring break, and defibrillators at bus stops for when they actually do break. Only a person who thinks paying capital gains tax is the same thing as being beaten up by a gang of social democrats would actually live there, but they do.</p> <p>In the report <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/jul/21/global-elite-tax-offshore-economy\" title=\"\">The Price of Offshore Revisited</a>, James Henry, formerly the chief economist at McKinsey, puts the amount invested through tax havens between \u00a313 trillion and \u00a320tn, which is more than US and Japanese GDP combined. It enough to write off third world debt, reinstitute Sure Start, even in a property market as inflated as Monaco, and buy the prime minister enough helicopters to fill the skies. He could spell out his name in them.</p> <p>Action is promised, but always snuffed out. The G20 said it would \"close the door on tax havens\" in 2009, after taxpayers bailed out banks and bankers \u2013 the state does have uses, you see, despite its baffling hunger for tax revenue. The G20 showed the robustness of its determination by flexing its giant fists and, er, requesting more transparency from tax havens, which they were, amazingly, reluctant to provide. And why would they when the people asking for transparency are so often the same people languishing offshore? This week the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2012/sep/20/peers-mps-directors-companies-linked-tax-havens\" title=\"\">Guardian reported that 68 peers and MPs</a> work for firms that operate in tax havens.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the amount held in bank accounts in tax havens was \u00a31.7tn in 2011 \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/may/07/tax-evasion-global-action\" title=\"\">the same as in 2007</a>. With insane hubris, the crackdown, a few treaties and a lot of money moving from tax haven to tax haven, was called a success. What would they consider a failure?</p> <p>In November, Angel Gurr\u00eda, general secretary of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, or, as I am calling it, the Organisation for Talk, Wait and Do Nothing, told the G20: \"The era of bank secrecy is over.\" The most amusing result was that Jersey was seriously rattled: in June, Sir Philip Bailhache (knighted 1996) the island's assistant chief minister, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jun/26/jersey-threatens-independence-tax-backlash\" title=\"\">threatened to declare independence</a> from the UK. On that, too, we are still waiting.</p> <p><em>Twitter: </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/TanyaGold1\" title=\"\"><em>@TanyaGold1</em></a></p>",
  "<p>If only the politicians would tell us what they really think, we say. If only they'd drop the soundbites and the focus-group-tested messaging and give it to us straight. Two politicians did just that this week. They granted us an unimpeded look into their true souls \u2013 and it wasn't pretty.</p> <p>Nick Clegg was not one of them. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2012/sep/20/nick-clegg-apology-tuition-fees-video\" title=\"\">His apology</a> over his broken tuition fee promise was meant to look candid and genuine, but it was as much a made-for-video stunt as his <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXw7yqHfxDI\" title=\"\">original pledge</a> \u2013 and, as one observer rightly noted, took the curious form of a husband saying \"<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JuliaHB1/status/248499548178239488\" title=\"\">sorry for my affair; next time I won't vow to be faithful</a>\".</p> <p>The act of unbridled honesty was committed instead by the chief whip Andrew Mitchell who, living up to his \"Thrasher\" nickname, gave a tongue-lashing to the police guarding Downing Street. Whether he called them \"f***ing plebs\" who ought to \"learn your f***ing place\", <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/politics/4549265/Andrew-Mitchell-insults-police-at-Downing-Street-by-calling-them-fing-plebs.html#ixzz277DyayRq\" title=\"\">as the Sun had it</a>, we may never know. But that Mitchell insulted men ready to risk their lives to protect him and his colleagues was confirmed when the chief whip telephoned the officer concerned to apologise.</p> <p>The damage will linger, suggesting this is what the government's most senior enforcer \u2013 a millionaire said to live as expensively as he was educated \u2013 really thinks: that the police are glorified servants who, if regrettably exempt these days from the obligation to bow and touch the forelock, ought at least to do what they're told by their betters. It is an ugly impression, one fast congealing in the public imagination as the defining feature of this government's top echelon: that they are a rich, over-privileged clique, out of touch with everyday life and with a nasty streak they cannot conceal.</p> <p>Luckily for David Cameron, Mitchell has next to no public profile and is in a job that requires even less. Unless more police officers <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/21/andrew-mitchell-police-tirade-labour\" title=\"\">demand his head</a>, he can be quietly disappeared. Across the Atlantic, the Republican party's problem is somewhat graver. The man whose true self was exposed this week is their nominee for president, Mitt Romney.</p> <p>It bears repeating that, as former Reagan speechwriter <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/peggynoonan/2012/09/18/time-for-an-intervention/?mod=e2tw\" title=\"\">Peggy Noonan puts it</a>, this was meant to be the year \"the Republican presidential candidate almost couldn't lose\". Barack Obama has disappointed, his poll rating usually below 50% with unemployment stubbornly above 8%. A halfway decent, generic Republican should win this comfortably. The election is Romney's to lose \u2013 and he is doing his best to make that happen.</p> <p>The killer blow may well prove to be the <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/09/watch-full-secret-video-private-romney-fundraiser\" title=\"\">secret video of his appearance</a> before a closed-door, $50,000-a-plate dinner for donors recorded in May but which surfaced this week. Much has been made of Romney's casual writing off of 47% of the American population as parasites who pay no income tax, see themselves as \"victims\", and believe the government owes them a living \u2013 to paraphrase only slightly \u2013 who will never vote for him anyway. As strategies for winning votes go, condemning half the electorate \u2013 including the millions of pensioners and veterans who receive benefits \u2013 is certainly novel.</p> <p>The candidate's remarks on Middle East peace were not much more politic, attacking the Palestinians as bent on Israel's destruction and admitting that his game plan for the conflict would simply be to \"kick the ball down the field and hope that ultimately, somehow, something will happen\".</p> <p>But while these specifics are gobsmacking, it's the overall tone of Romney unplugged that is so striking. Read the <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/09/full-transcript-mitt-romney-secret-video#nodeal\" title=\"\">full transcript</a> and you realise that you are eavesdropping on a meeting of the 1%, a conclave of the cosseted super-rich of which Romney is so clearly a part.</p> <p>He begins with a quip about inheritance planning, which clearly resonates with his audience. He gets another laugh when he jokes about immigration, chuckling that if \"you have no skill or experience \u2026 you're welcome to cross the border and stay here for the rest of your life\". Romney goes on to voice the perennial, if improbable, complaint of the privileged white male: that life would be so much easier if he were fashionably ethnic. Recalling that his father was born in Mexico to American parents, he muses that \"had he been born of Mexican parents I'd have a better shot at winning this \u2026 it'd be helpful if they'd been Latino\".</p> <p>That's not the only instance of what is said to be a common feature of the extremely wealthy: self-pity. An audience member complains that people don't realise how hard it is for multimillionaires like them: \"We kill ourselves, we don't work a nine to five. We're away from our families five days&#xa0;a&#xa0;week.\" Romney shouldn't apologise for his wealth, they tell him,&#xa0;he should be proud of it. But \"I'm as poor as a church mouse\", the candidate replies \u2013 and, in that company, he might well be.</p> <p>The Romney caught on video could not be less appealing, a Monty Burns caricature of a heartless plutocrat. The persona his aides have worked so hard to construct is left shattered into a thousand glassy pieces. They brag of his devotion as a husband. But at the fundraiser he speaks of his wife in terms that are icily transactional: \"We use Ann sparingly right now, so that people don't get tired of her.\"</p> <p>The word \"gaffe\" doesn't do justice to this. Gaffe is adding an \"e\" to the end of the word \"potato\", <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/frenzy/quayle3.htm\" title=\"\">as Dan Quayle did</a>, or forgetting the third government department you plan to close, which <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-15680178\" title=\"\">undid Romney's Republican rival Rick Perry</a>. This is gaffe as diagnosed by the commentator Michael Kinsley: when the mask slips and a politician accidentally tells the truth about themselves.</p> <p>Something similar happened to Obama four years ago when \u2013 also at a closed-door fundraiser \u2013 he mused on those <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/apr/14/barackobama.uselections2008\" title=\"\">small-town voters who get \"bitter\"</a> at the state of their lives and so \"cling to guns or religion\". He would never have put it like that publicly, but it exposed an Ivy League condescension that was real.</p> <p>Such moments are not trivial but illuminating. The Romney tape, for example, reveals an Ayn Rand, survival-of-the-fittest philosophy, pitting <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/michael-gerson-a-republican-mind-set-without-promise/2012/09/20/798901f8-0344-11e2-91e7-2962c74e7738_story.html\" title=\"\">the \"makers\" against the \"takers\"</a>, that is crucial to understanding today's Republican party. And somehow, for all the complaints of control and artifice, the much-derided modern presidential campaign rarely fails to produce such moments of clarity. Yes, it is flawed \u2013 both too long and too costly. But it provides a priceless service, a scrutiny from which no candidate can hide.</p> <p>Being president \"reveals who you are,\" <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/04/michelle-obama-democratic-convention-live\" title=\"\">Michelle Obama told the Democratic convention</a> earlier this month. Running for president does the same thing. The trouble for Mitt Romney is&#xa0;that not many Americans like what they see.</p> <p><em>Twitter </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/j_freedland?tw_i=244868341578211328&amp;tw_e=screenname&amp;tw_p=tweetembed\" title=\"\"><em>@j_freedland</em></a></p>",

In the highest echelons of power, we've seen Bill Clinton grudgingly throw his weight behind Barack Obama, George Bush formally endorse John McCain, and Sarah Palin praise the Romney/Ryan ticket. While these stamps of approval must inevitably sometimes be seen as proverbial albatrosses, every so often they can be just the boost you need.</p> <p>Now imagine the coup if an entire presidential staff were persuaded to record a video in support of a candidate for Michigan's supreme court. Lucky Bridget Mary McCormack then, for she has managed just that. President Josiah Bartlet (leader of the free world: 1999-2007), and his staff have recorded a message to persuade the great people of Michigan to be aware of the non-partisan candidates on the ballot, and in particular, for McCormack. The video has gone viral, and caught the eye of many a media outlet not previously inclined to cover the local election with such enthusiasm. This shouldn't surprise anyone, given that Jed Bartlet has regularly been voted America's most popular president, with approval ratings that would make even Mitt Romney finally embrace those pesky 47%.</p> <p>Of course, you know that there was no \"real\" President Bartlet. But for those of us who watched the West Wing with an almost religious zeal during the Bush years, it was hard not to wish that there was. The fictional president was a studious and thoughtful man, with a degree of honesty and belief that voters don't usually find in real politicians. His staff were passionate, hard working and often too attractive for Washington (hello, Josh Lyman, Charlie Young et al). </p> <p>Throughout each of the seven seasons, we followed the frustrations of governance and came to understand just how seriously the characters took it. This was often in stark contrast to the famous gaffes of George Bush, which only made the fictitious White House seem that much more competent.</p> <p>Since the West Wing has secured its place in TV history with its enduring popularity, Bridget Mary McCormack may very well have played her trump card. The video is bereft of the opulent White House set, and it's hard to explain non-partisan candidacy in a particularly gripping manner, but despite this, the short film manages to capture the basic essence of the series. The famous \"walk and talk\" is there, as is the Aaron Sorkin-like lofty dialogue that can veer dangerously towards pretension. </p> <p>As the nostalgia for these particularly loved in-jokes builds, fans will be sure to check out McCormack's credentials, and no doubt enjoy her close link to one of the cast (she is Mary McCormack's sister). By any stretch, she will be more recognised today than she ever could have been previously. You cannot buy this kind of spotlight unless you are actually the president.</p> <p>Without wanting to criticize my beloved political dream team, I might offer two criticisms of the short reunion. The first is whether a globally watched video actually can make the desired impact in one specific state. As one YouTube viewer said: \"Good luck on your campaign..wish I lived there to vote for you!\" </p> <p>And therein lies the problem. Whilst I'm prepared to pack up my bags and ship off to Michigan to vote in a West Wing-endorsed race, will it convince the locals? Hollywood has a record of turning off voters when they engage in the electoral process. Will the Michigan electorate really listen to the points made on the video, or will the problem of low voter engagement for non-partisan candidates remain just that?</p> <p>The more obvious problem with this kind of campaign is the realization that we live in a world where a fictional president is more effective at capturing the electorate's attention than the wars, recession and global warming that some of us will actually face in our lives. </p> <p>Does the affection reserved for a TV show that ended six years ago still have the power to make people get out and vote? And what does it say if our real politicians can never muster this kind of loyal turnout? </p> <p>It's unlikely that I'll be watching the state supreme court results, however.

  "<p>Fifteen people were killed and nearly 200 injured in Pakistan on Friday as angry protests that have raged all week against a blasphemous US film mocking the prophet MUhammad continued to engulf the Muslim world.</p> <p>There were violent demonstrations in Pakistan after the government took the questionable decision to declare a national holiday to allow people to rally against the video. Tens of thousands took to the streets in all major cities. Many protests descended into serious unrest. Protesters threw objects at police, who retaliated with teargas canisters and live rounds.</p> <p>The provocative US trailer, Innocence of Muslims, also prompted protests in at least half a dozen other countries on Friday, with demonstrators burning American flags and effigies of Barack Obama. The unrest capped a tumultuous 10 days that has seen the murder of the US ambassador to Libya, Chris Stevens, in what the White House says was a well-plotted terrorist attack, possibly linked to al-Qaida.</p> <p>The film has caused a deep crisis for the US administration. It has also provoked a pained discussion in Europe and the US over the boundaries of free speech. Several of the latest protests were also directed at France after the satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo published fresh Muhammad caricatures.</p> <p>France took a tough line on protests on Friday, with the interior minister, Manuel Valls, saying no demonstrations against the cartoons would be allowed. Paris closed its embassy in Egypt, where a few dozen protesters congregated on Friday. Germany also shut its Egypt mission.</p> <p>But it was Pakistan that saw the most inflammatory scenes. Some 195 people were reportedly wounded in the cities of Peshawar, Karachi and Islamabad \u2013 with nine killed in Karachi and four in Peshawar. One of the Karachi dead was a policeman. He was apparently killed in an exchange of gunfire with protesters. Unknown gunmen also shot and wounded three other policemen.</p> <p>In Peshawar, the frontier city close to the Afghan border, mobs attacked buildings and set fire to cinemas. One victim, Muhammad Amir, was the driver of broadcast truck owned by the television network ARY. He was hit by police fire. He later died of his wounds in hospital but not before the television station broadcast continuous loops of him in obvious pain being attended to in an emergency room.</p> <p>In Karachi rioters torched police vans, looted shops and even attacked the coastal port city's fire brigade. For a second day running in Islamabad, the normally sedate capital, violence was concentrated in front of the five-star Serena hotel,situated on a road that leads to the entrance to the fenced-off diplomatic quarter where the US embassy is located.</p> <p>\"America has challenged the Muslim nation by making this movie,\" said a 19-year-old called Mohammad Fayyaz, who kept his face covered as he joined the violence in the capital. He added: \"We will not go until the man who made the film is hanged.\"</p> <p>The White House has made desperate efforts over the past week to defuse the protests. Speaking on television and radio adverts, the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, has emphasised that the US government had nothing to do with the film's production. The acting US ambassador in Pakistan, Richard Hoagland, met with government officials to once again to reiterate that the US government \"condemned this video's content and its message\".</p> <p>But the US's vigorous campaign of public diplomacy appears not to have worked. In many places in Pakistan, crowds were able to break through barricades placed in their way by police. Images streaming in from all over the country on Pakistan's frenetic cable news channels got steadily grimmer as what the government had billed as \"love of prophet Muhammad day\" wore on and protests descended into battles and looting.</p> <p>Mobile phone networks had been turned off in 15 cities in an effort to frustrate the ability of crowds to organise themselves, but it appeared to have no effect and services were restored well before the originally advertised time of 6pm. In Lahore, the grand colonial era Mall Road was the setting for skirmishes by demonstrators who also attempted to approach the US consulate in the city.</p> <p>In Iraq about 3,000 protesters condemned the film as well as the French caricatures. The protest in the southern city of Basra was organised by Iranian-backed Shia groups. Some protesters raised Iraqi flags and posters of Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, while chanting \"death to America\".</p> <p>In the Sri Lankan capital of Colombo, about 2,000 Muslims burned effigies of Obama and US flags at a protest after Friday prayers. In Bangladesh, over 2,000 people marched through the streets of the capital, Dhaka, to express outrage at the film. Small and mostly orderly protests were also held in Malaysia and Indonesia.</p> <p>Thousands also gathered in Lebanon's Bekaa valley for the latest in a series of protest rallies organised by the militant group Hezbollah. There was also unrest in Indian-administered Kashmir. Police imposed a day-long curfew in the Kashmir valley, and in the main city, Srinagar, police chased away protesters. Authorities in the region also temporarily blocked mobile and internet services.</p> <p>Critics in Pakistan lambasted the decision of the government to make Friday a national holiday. They said hardline religious parties, many of them fronts for banned terrorist organisations, hijacked the day off as a chance to show off their street power.</p> <p>Raza Rumi, a prominent analyst and newspaper columnist, said the government had chosen a policy of appeasement. \"The government is under immense pressure to appear as Islamic and as pious as anyone,\" he said. \"But it could have chosen alternative strategy of engaging with the various religious groups and launched a public campaign to educate people rather than letting them take to the streets.\"</p> <p>Earlier in the day, Pakistan's prime minister, Raja Pervaiz Ashraf, addressed a gathering of politicians and top clerics in Islamabad. While he called for peaceful protests, he also used language likely to inflame the many protests that have claimed the video is part of a plot involving Jewish, Israeli and US interests. \"It is ironical that denial of holocaust is considered a crime but no consideration is paid to the feelings of Muslims,\" he said. \"I hope the international community and Islamic world will be successful in preventing such things.\"</p> <p>If the intention of the government was to burnish its Islamic credentials in the run-up to the election in six months, many protesters were not convinced. \"[President Asif Ali] Zardari is a man with no grace, he should resign,\" said Tabarak Lateef, a 22-year-old protester in Islamabad. \"Our rulers are traitors, they are American slaves and they should be ashamed of themselves.\"</p>",
  "<p>Rudeness is back in the news today. When is it ever absent, you may well ask, when Russell Brand still stalks the airwaves or our courts are obliged to discuss whether a footballer's stream of public abuse of a rival player breaks the law, not because it is foul-mouthed and offensive, but because a racial epithet may be attached? Rudeness about Islam is an inflammatory topic \u2013 literally so \u2013 again this autumn.</p> <p>By comparison with riots over American films and French magazines, today's domestic excitement is mild and not all the news is bad. Andrew Mitchell, the government chief whip, is accused \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/politics/4549265/Andrew-Mitchell-insults-police-at-Downing-Street-by-calling-them-fing-plebs.html\" title=\"\">by the Sun</a>, no less \u2013 of being rude to Downing Street police officers who told him he couldn't ride his bike through the big double gates into Whitehall but would have to use the pedestrian side gate like everyone else in the biking community.</p> <p>I'm slightly torn on this one. I try not to believe what I (rarely) read in the Sun unless it's strictly necessary. Last week's Hillsborough expos\u00e9 has reopened some fading wounds and uncharitable thoughts about its operational habits in the Murdoch era, though I accept Ofcom's verdict that they don't behave that way at BSkyB. Being accused of rudeness by the Sun is like being accused of egotism by Edwina Currie.</p> <p>There again, I know that smoothie, Andrew Mitchell. He can be charming, but also a bit snooty and rude. I can well imagine him saying something along the lines reported by the Sun. Was it just gossip which the paper picked up? Or did annoyed coppers shop the chief whip to teach him good manners, the more so because the incident took place just a day after the double police murder in Manchester?</p> <p>Perhaps. That sort of thing happens in these less than deferential times, but even in the days of steep social hierarchy the better sort of toff was not supposed to abuse their social inferiors in such coarse terms. In what nostalgics call the good old days it wasn't remote like Downton Abbey where most of the Crawley family's time seems to be taken up with worrying about the staff.</p> <p>But putting on a decent show did not include effing and blinding at police officers or (denied) calling them \"plebs\". In the good old days the coppers might have quietly punctured Mitchell's tyres or, worse, breathalysed him biking home. In the Flanders trenches of 1914-18 they might just have shot him.</p> <p>The better overnight news is that Keir Starmer, the director of public prosecutions (DPP), said this week that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/20/dpp-prosecutions-facebook-twitter-abuse\" title=\"\">offensive tweets on social media should not attract prosecution unless</a> they can be shown to be part of \"a sustained campaign of harassment\" \u2013 the kind of nastiness which causes persistent distress and occasionally drives people to suicide.</p> <p>Good for Keir Starmer. In launching a consultation on how best to proceed in our new world of instant and often horribly inaccurate social media here's part of what he said:</p> <blockquote> \"Access to social media is ubiquitous and instantaneous. Banter, jokes and offensive comment are commonplace and often spontaneous. Communications intended for a few may reach millions. <br>\"Against that background, the CPS [Crown Prosecution Service] has the task of balancing the fundamental right of free speech and the need to prosecute serious wrongdoing on a case by case basis. That often involves very difficult judgment calls and, in the largely uncharted territory of social media, the CPS is proceeding on a case by case basis.\" </blockquote> <p>Free speech, eh? What will they think of next? He's right and he's also right that it's not easy when the police, over-stretched in so many ways already, are now dealing with 14,000 such cases a year. Elsewhere in today's papers we learned that the internet troll who abused the diver Tom Daley and his diving partner, Peter Waterfield, after they failed to win Olympic medals. It had been a misguided attempt at humour and a one-off, meant for limited circulation, the CPS decided.</p> <p>Yet the person who set up a Facebook site to celebrate the alleged murderer of the two Manchester police officers was arrested this week under the Communications Act 2003. Putting aside the personal feelings of the arresting officers I think we can follow the logic of that, can't we. A website is a much more positive act that a tweet, its offence calculated and sustained.</p> <p>But it's tricky territory in which all of us are sometimes confused and contradictory.</p> <p>To take one obvious example on my working patch, many voters dislike the slanging match they witness at PMQs \u2013 but some of the same people hate it even more when they see the political class in constructive agreement. That's cosying up, we don't like that. Ditto Nick Clegg's now-famous apology \u2013 at this rate It will be a West End musical by Christmas \u2013 which attracted vituperation out of all proportion to its merit. I thought we wanted our elected leaders to own up to error?</p> <p>Women columnists have long complained about the violent and misogynistic tone of comments made below the line in what is an overwhelmingly male (and safely anonymous) world of tweeting and trolling. But it's far wider than that and hard to escape the suspicion that the liberating possibilities of the internet unleash demons as well as the wholesome decency anyone of us can find if we make a Google search for jam-making, medical advice or beekeeping.</p> <p>It matters because \u2013 so the BBC's Justin Webb was reporting on the Today programme from Florida \u2013 the temper of many Romney-Obama partisans in US presidential elections is getting even uglier and lies circulated online are hard to monitor or expose. I'm making a judgment here about Andrew Mitchell's clash with the coppers and conclude he was indeed probably rude to them. But I could be wrong \u2026</p> <p>Overshadowing most such debates about our wired world is Islam and the hyper-sensitivity of some Muslims to slights, real or imaginary, justified or merely abusive, on their faith and its founder. It's all far worse than it was in 1989 when the Iranian fatwa was issued against Salman Rushdie over his impenetrable novel The Satanic Verses. Hearing him promote his memoirs this week is to be reminded what an irritating fellow Rushdie can be, the Edwina Currie of literature.</p> <p>But the British taxpayer was right to protect him, even though he has been characteristically ungrateful. Would we be so brave today? I hope so but Channel 4's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/sep/11/channel-4-cancels-screening-islam\" title=\"\">recent cancellation</a> of historian Tom Holland's film on the historic \u2013 as distinct from theological \u2013 origins of Islam is one of many straws in the hurricane which suggest otherwise. Holland is not some ignorant American crazy with a grudge.</p> <p>Islam is a religion undergoing the enormous strains of belated modernisation which we must hope will eventually deliver it to a better place. So I have some sympathy. As an American judge once observed no one's free speech gives them the right to shout \"Fire!\" in a crowded theatre. The law exists to protect cinema-goers from such dangerous irresponsibility and Muslims \u2013 or police officers - from incitement.</p> <p>And, as with internet trolls, chief whips too for that matter, manners and taste should also act as restraints. But the argument cuts both ways. The absence of free speech and rigorous intellectual inquiry during the declining centuries of Islam \u2013 the Ottoman empire banned the new-fangled printing press \u2013 contributed to its decline, just as the onslaught by Christian fundamentalists on American science will do there unless it is checked.</p> <p>Free speech under the law is fundamental. Now Keir Starmer, tell us exactly what the law says.</p>",
  "<p>Sometimes, there is a myth that simply won't die. It just gets repeated over and over, without much reason. Meet the <a href=\"http://therightnewz.com/?p=9543\">50% rule</a>: this is the idea that if an incumbent is under 50%, then he could lose because undecideds break towards the challenger.</p> <p>Barack Obama is <a href=\"http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/ 2012-general-election-romney-vs-obama\">polling</a> at about 48% and up by about 3 percentage points right now. The 50% rule says Obama may be leading, but may not win if the election were today. The truth of the matter is that an Obama lead of 3 percentage points, and being at 48%, is a fine position for an incumbent. Here's why:</p> <p><strong>1). The winner of this election is likely only going <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ JoeLenski/status/246333440247595008\">to need 49%</a> of the vote</strong></p> <p>It may get lost in the daily back and forth of the campaign, but there are other candidates besides Obama and Mitt Romney running.</p> <p>Former New Mexico Governor Gary Johnson is running on the Libertarian ticket, and is arguably the most respectable third party campaign since Ralph Nader in 2000. He is already <a href=\"http://www.lp.org/2012-ballot-access\">on the ballot</a> in 48 of the 50 states and is in position to be on the ballot in all 50. Considering that the ideologically similar Ron Paul <a href=\"http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=2012f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=2\">doubled</a> his primary vote from <a href=\"http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=2008&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=2\">2008</a>, don't be surprised if Johnson doubles the <a href=\"http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=2008&amp;minper=0&amp;f=1&amp;off=0&amp;elect=0\">2008 Libertarian party performance</a>. That puts him on track for about 0.8% of the national vote.</p> <p>The Constitution party's Virgil Goode has less ballot access, but is certainly more impressive than his party 2008 candidate, Charles Baldwin. Goode is a former congressman who may play a <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/OTUS/meet-virgil-goode-immgration-hard-liner-sink-romney/story?id=17212388\">spoiler role in Virginia</a>. He could pick up 0.2-0.3% of the national vote.</p> <p>Don't forget the liberal third party candidates. You can probably add in another 0.2-0.3% for the Green party's nominee, <a href=\"http://www.jillstein.org/\">Jill Stein</a>. And who really knows what percentage of the vote comedian and Peace and Freedom party candidate <a href=\"http://politics.heraldtribune.com/2012/09/17/roseanne-barr-to-join-11 other-presidential-candidates-on-florida-ballot/\">Roseanne Barr</a> will get? Plus, there are many other minor parties and write-ins.</p> <p>The bottom line is that it's quite possible that the third party vote may add up to 2%.</p> <p>Obama's certainly at 48%, and a number of polls have him at 49% or higher. Even if you believe that 80% of undecideds go for the challenger, Obama would still collect more than 1 percentage point overall from undecideds to put him over the 49% threshold.</p> <p><strong>2). Historically, undecideds don't break towards the challenger</strong></p> <p>Back in 2004, I remember confidently strutting around thinking that John Kerry would do better than polls had him \u2013 because of this notion that undecideds break towards the challenger. I got a good smack of reality when the results came in. Kerry did not do substantially better than his percentage in the pre-election <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2004/president/us/general_election_bush_vs_kerry-939.html\">polls</a>. In fact, it was George W Bush who slightly over-performed.</p> <p>Studies have found that 2004 was no aberration. Nate Silver <a href=\"http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/22/do-presidential-polls-break-toward-challengers/\">examined</a> September polls and compared them to the November results. He found that while challengers generally do better, it's not by as much as you might think \u2013 nor why you would think.</p> <p>It turns out that whichever candidate is trailing (challenger or incumbent) cuts the leading candidate's edge by about 30% from September polls. That means if an incumbent is leading by 2.5 points, you'd expect him to win by about 1.8 percentage points in November. Because the number of points gained by the challenger is proportional to the incumbent's lead, we often see gains greater than 1 point as challengers are often behind by more than Romney is right now.</p> <p>Once we get to the final polls, both candidates should, on average, do about as well as the polls have them placing.</p> <p><strong>3). 2012 undecided voters do not overwhelmingly look like Romney supporters</strong></p> <p>The pool of undecided voters is likely less than 10% of the electorate at this point. Indeed, with a fairly stark choice between the candidates, it's a wonder how the percentage is that high.</p> <p>The profile of the undecideds turns out to match reasonable assumptions. Undecideds <a href=\"http://argojournal.blogspot.com/2012/07/poll-watch-rasmussen-r-2012.html\">don't approve</a> of Obama's job performance, but they <a href=\"http://www.tnr.com/blog/electionate/105743/romney-undecided-voters\">hate Romney</a>. They <a href=\"http://about.civicscience.com/blog/2012/8/29/the-mystery-of-the-undecided-voter.html\">don't watch</a> the news and tend to be independents. Undecideds don't sit around forming partisan opinions all day, because they tend to have better things to do.</p> <p>They are the type of voters who could be persuaded by a television ad. Obama has <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/09/17/the-ad-wars-obama-has-been-outspending-romney-and-the-superpacs/\">more ads airing</a> in the swing states than Romney does. While Romney and his fellow Republicans may have more ads in the final months than Obama and his allies will, that advantage <a href=\"http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2012/09/17/will_ad_fatigue_among_voters_mute_gops_cash_edge__115468.html\">won't be overwhelming</a>. There is also likely to be a point of saturation, with diminishing returns for the extra airplay.</p> <p>Moreover, ask yourself this question: do you choose the product you don't like but know, or the product you like even less and don't know? We saw this formula play out in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/apr/20/2012-douche-v-turd-election\">many state-wide races</a> in 2010. In at least three elections, the incumbent had negative net approval ratings and the challenger had negative net favorable ratings. In all these races, the incumbent managed to survive.</p> <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p> <p>President Obama is in fine shape given the current polling data, even though he isn't at 50% support. If the polling aggregates continue to show him leading by a 2 percentage-point or greater margin at the end of the week (that is, after the fading of the convention bounces), then he's going to be a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/20/post-convention-polling-obama-consolidates-lead\">clear favorite to win in November</a>.</p>",
  "<p>Mitt Romney faced a fresh setback Friday at the end of his worst week since the presidential campaign when newly released figures showed he has come off second-best to Barack Obama in an area the Republicans had expected to be dominant: fundraising.</p> <p>The Obama campaign team, after a series of frantic appeals for funds from small donors throughout the summer, has $88m on hand to spend on ads and campaign staff in the coming weeks. Romney has $50m but that includes $15m he has to repay on a loan, leaving him with $35m.</p> <p>So far this campaign, Obama has raised $774m, giving him an edge over Romney, whose supporters have raised $736m.</p> <p>The Romney strategy for winning the White House was based largely on a promise that he would outspend Obama by about two to one in the biggest ad blitz America has ever seen in the final months of the campaign. But, in spite of his personal wealth and the support of billionaires, that strategy appears to be going up in smoke.</p> <p>Although the election is still a month and a half away, some senior Republicans are already beginning to write off their hopes of retaking the White House unless there is some major international event, such as a Middle East crisis that pushes up the price of petrol, or some bad economic news or a major gaffe by Obama.</p> <p>Former Republican speechwriter Peggy Noonan, in an comment piece in the Wall Street Journal on Friday, voiced the criticism many Republicans have been making in private and joined calls for a change at the top of the campaign team.</p> <p>It was the second time this week that Noonan has been critical. Referring to her earlier piece about the campaign, she wrote: \"This week I called it incompetent, but only because I was being polite. I really meant rolling calamity.\"</p> <p>Romney's wife, Ann, offered a rare glimpse of the growing sense of frustration inside the camp in the face of such criticism. In an interview with Radio Iowa, she told critics: \"Stop it. This is hard. You want to try it? Get in the ring.\"</p> <p>It was not a helpful intervention, only adding to the sense of disarray.<br>Obama is ahead in the polls both nationally and in almost all the seven swing states that will decide the election: Florida, Ohio, New Hampshire, Virginia, Iowa, Colorado and Nevada. One poll had Obama ahead of Romney by 5% in Colorado and 8% in Iowa.</p> <p>Romney embarked on a new strategy Friday, his second campaign re-launch in the space of five days. The first relaunch on Monday, announced by one of his strategists, Ed Gillespie, promised Romney would become more specific about what policies he would pursue in office rather than the negative approach of concentrating almost solely on attacking Obama's record.</p> <p>That strategy lasted little more than a few hours until Romney, in the biggest setback to his campaign yet, was confronted with a devastating secret video of his speech to a small, $50,000-a-place dinner for Republican donors in Florida in which he characterised 47% of the American population as freeloaders, dependent on federal government help. </p> <p>At a 12,000-strong campaign rally on Friday in Virginia \u2013 a key battleground state \u2013 Obama stepped up his attack on Romney's 47% remark. \"I don't see a lot of victims in this crowd today. I see a lot of hard working Virginians,\" he told the crowd in Woodbridge.</p> <p>As part of the new-look strategy, Romney, who, unusually for a candidate at this stage in the election cycle, has been largely absent from the campaign trail over the last two weeks, is visiting the swing states where his hoping to address large rallies and stick to a scripted speech rather than the off-the-cuff remarks that have landed him in trouble.</p> <p>The Democratic party is warning against complacency, stressing that there are still weeks of campaigning left, including three presidential debates, the first on 3 October. Early voting begins in some states next week.</p> <p>Former president Bill Clinton, who provided the star turn at the Democratic convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, this month, warned that while Romney will have to do a lot of explaining about what he meant about his 47% comment, Democrats should not believe that gaffe amounts to a knock-out punch.</p> <p>He told CNN: \"I still think you have to assume it's going to be a close race, assume it's a hard fight and then fight through it. But I think the president has the advantage now. We did have a very good convention. He got a good boost out of it.\"</p> <p>The Clinton call for caution was reinforced when Obama, in an interview with Latinos, said that \"change\", the slogan on which he campaigned on in 2008, could not come from inside Washington but outside.</p> <p>Romney is to push this line during a tour this weekend of Ohio and Colorado, saying he cannot believe the president who won on a slogan of \"Yes we can\" was now saying he could not implement change from inside Washington.</p> <p>The details of fundraising for August, released on Thursday night as required by law, show that Obama's coffers were boosted mainly by small donors.<br>Obama's campaign team, separate from the Democratic effort, raised $85m compared with Romney's $67m.</p> <p>Obama's campaign, combined with a separate fundraising efforts by the Democratic party, raised $114m to Romney's and the Republican party's $111.6m.</p> <p>The Obama Super Pac Priorities USA also out-raised for the first time this year its conservative counterpart Restore Our Future. Priorities was helped by big individual donors such as billionaire hedge manager Jim Simons who gave $2m.</p> <p>According to the figures submitted to the federal election commission, Obama's campaign spent more than $83m in August and Romney $66m.</p>",
  "<p>Mitt Romney's historic gaffe <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2012/09/17/mitt_romney_47_gaffe_what_was_he_trying_to_say_.html\">caught on video</a> \u2013 published, with great timing, by the left-leaning Mother Jones magazine \u2013 in which he said that his campaign was writing off 47% of American voters since they \"depended on government\" handouts, was committed in an equally significant manner, as he delivered the remarks to a closed group of potential major donors in Florida. GOP stalwart and Wall Street Journal columnist Peggy Noonan is calling for an intervention in the campaign, and even some fellow Republicans are <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/a-mitt-storm-republicans-joining-growing-chorus-romney-incompetent-47-gaffe-campaign-a-spiral-pull-republican-strategist-running-mate-paul-ryan-chimes-romney-inarticulate-article-1.1162783\">scampering</a> to distance themselves from the inflammatory remarks.</p> <p>But I find the remarks fascinating and important to deconstruct because they affirm \u2013 as insider discourse captured for the public often can \u2013 the fact that a new kind of narrative for America has taken over from one of our oldest and most cherished national myths. What Romney's comments reveal is that the American Dream is dead, killed off by skepticism from the bottom up \u2013 by the 99% of lower-income and middle-class people who no longer believe in it \u2013 and by cynicism from the top down \u2013 by the 1%, top-earning people who don't believe in it.</p> <p>What, after all, is the narrative of \"the American Dream\"? It was a discourse formulated between the 1880s and the 1920s in the United States during the great waves of migration and expansion and reforms of the Progressive Era. Slogans, often used by political leaders who wished to court the aspirational, immigrant vote, invoked a promise that America was \"the land of opportunity\", where hard work, gumption and a bit of luck could make any poor kid a millionaire. </p> <p>This mythology, embodied over those decades in the <a href=\"http://nymag.com/news/features/money-brain-2012-7/index5.html\">Horatio Alger</a> stories consumed particularly by upwardly mobile young men and in the phrase \"to pull oneself up by one's bootstraps\", consistently held out that American promise by equating hard work (along with other good Puritan values such as delayed gratification, temperance, saving and self-reliance) with economic success. As new waves of immigrants reached our shores after the second world war, the implicit pledge was elaborated into the idea for immigrants that even if their own hard work did not lift them into a new social class, it would elevate their children into the ever-growing ranks of the middle class.</p> <p>The promise of the American Dream swept many presidents into power. Reagan offered a rightwing verison of it, with Bill Clinton \u2013 departing from leftwing orthodoxy \u2013 offering voters in 1992 a refreshingly-worded progressive version of the same promise: \"<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/09/opinion/sunday/friedman-new-rules.html\">work hard and play by the rules</a>\" and success will follow. Barack Obama, too, reprised the phrase in his 2008 campaign.</p> <p>But now, the injunction to \"work hard and play by the rules\" is more likely to elicit a cynical cough of derision than a rush to the polling station.

And everyone knows it.</p> <p>It is not surprising that the 99% stopped using the language of the American Dream, but what is notable from Romney's remarks is that even the wealthy have abandoned it. Notable because the premise \u2013 that their own hard work and ingenuity is what caused their wealth to aggregate \u2013 is a flattering and self-validating narrative. So, the fact that even the rich don't buy a version of what is now self-delusion is striking.</p> <p>What Romney's remarks show is that the wealthy are handling the corruption of a system that benefits them by assigning blame for the destruction of the American Dream to the have-nots. In the Reagan years, only \"<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/01/23/politics/weflare-queen/index.html\">welfare queens</a>\" and the small percentage of people actually on food stamps were targeted as drains on the system \u2013 needing \"government handouts\" and failing to \"take responsibility for their lives\". Now, as Romney admits, the wealthy deem virtually half the voting public as irredeemably shiftless moochers. Notable, too, is Romney's use of an Occupy-echoing phrase, \"the 47%\", whom he feels free to objectify and dismiss.</p> <p>Not especially shocking, though, is the fact that he is explaining to donors that he does not need that half of America. (Anyone who has worked on presidential campaigns knows that strategists all write off the 47% who will never vote for them; they just don't tend to go on camera to do that disparaging.)</p> <p>I have been noticing, with sadness, that politicians do not even bother invoking the American Dream anymore. They know that we know that everything is rigged against it now, and that the language no longer persuades even the most naive and idealistic; the best you'll get from a politician is a pledge, playing to nostalgia, to restore its lost promise. But what is striking about Romney's remarks is that they have replaced that commitment with a willingness to blame a vast swath of striving, middle-class Americans for their plight.</p> <p>We thus see a turning-point in American conservative philosophy. This was the moment when the wealthy elite stopped believing its own PR, the self-affirming myth of that economic success can always be had for those who want it and are willing to work. Mitt Romney has told us that it's now simply class war: a struggle to stop the other half getting what \"we\" have. Thank you for your candor, Mr Romney.</p>",
  "<p>The battle is on for France's opposition party to find a successor to Nicolas Sarkozy to unite the divided right and return it to power.</p> <p>The centre-right UMP party is looking for a charismatic leader who can rally support after losing its 17-year hold on the presidency to Socialist Fran\u00e7ois Hollande in May.</p> <p>Several former ministers had suggested they would stand as party general secretary, but after weeks of speculation the field was reduced to just two when the deadline for nominations closed last week.</p> <p>Now the former prime minister Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, 58, and his younger rival Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Cop\u00e9, 48, the current party chief, will go head to head for the job.</p> <p>The two men claim to be natural successors to Sarkozy, with whom both had an uneasy, at times hostile, relationship in recent years.</p> <p>Fillon, a discreet and serious character whose wife is Welsh, is seen as an experienced, safe pair of hands. He was appointed PM in 2007 after helping Sarkozy win his presidential election bid.</p> <p>Defying frequent reports that he was to be replaced in a reshuffle, Fillon remained at Matignon (the prime minister's official residence) throughout Sarkozy's five-year term in office.</p> <p>Cop\u00e9, once sidelined by Sarkozy as a potential rival, was brought back to his inner circle as head of the UMP in 2010. Unashamedly ambitious and seen as more charismatic and hyperactive than his rival, he is presenting himself as Sarkozy Mark II, telling supporters he will \"walk in the footsteps\" of the former president.</p> <p>\"France needs someone who is going to jump in and get their hands dirty,\" he said recently. He added he would step down if Sarkozy decided to return to mainline politics.</p> <p>Fillon said he too would remain close to Sarkozy: \"I cannot imagine leading the party he helped to develop without his support,\" Fillon told the daily Le Parisien.</p> <p>In a swipe at Cop\u00e9 he added: \"The truth is that Sarkozyism is a bit like love; there are those who speak a lot about it because they have reason to do so. Their love is fairly recent, while there are others who over the years can prove their love.\"</p> <p>Both are keen to play up links to Sarkozy after an opinion poll by LH2 published on Tuesday found that 43% of rightwing voters think Sarkozy would have the best chance of regaining the presidency for the UMP party in 2017, ahead of Fillon, with 32%, and Cope, with 21%.</p> <p>However, polls give Fillon a considerable lead over Cop\u00e9, which the younger candidate will hope to close in the coming weeks.</p> <p>In policy terms, less divides Fillon and Cop\u00e9, who have similar views on economics and Europe. Both support tighter budget discipline and reforms to lower employment charges.</p> <p>Last week, there was a brief spat between both camps over the number of supporters each had among card-carrying UMP members.</p> <p>On Tuesday, Cop\u00e9 announced with great fanfare that he had amassed 30,000 signatures. Within hours the Fillon camp responded by announcing its candidate had at least 45,000. A member of Cop\u00e9's team said the news had fallen on the candidate like \"a thump on the head\".</p> <p>The only woman who had been seriously in the running, former environment minister Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, who was Sarkozy's spokesperson during his election campaign,was in third position but stood down at the last minute.</p> <p>\"Many of our supporters were hoping for a third way so the election didn't end up being a duel between Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Cop\u00e9 and Fran\u00e7ois Fillon,\" she told French journalists. \"It's not necessarily such a good image for our party,\" she added.</p> <p>NKM, as she is known, refused to say who she would support.</p> <p>The candidates will officially begin their campaigns on 5 October and party members will vote on a new leader on 18 November.</p> <p>Cop\u00e9 will publish his campaign programme on 3 October, entitled Manifesto for an Uninhibited Right. \"Those who read it will see what I have in my heart,\" he said, adding that it contained some \"suggestions to shock\".</p> <p>The highlight of the campaign will be a televised debate. Cop\u00e9 has welcomed the chance to go face-to-face live with his rival, but Fillon's camp has been more cautious.</p> <p>\"A debate in the same political family is always a little complicated,\" said Fillon's campaign director Eric Ciotti.</p>",
  "<!-- Block 1 --> <p>9.15am: Today it's the Ukip annual conference and I was up early to get on a train to Birmingham. I've never been to a Ukip conference before. In fact, only a few years ago, any half-decent political correspondent volunteering to attend would have been dismissed by colleagues as an eccentric. That was in the era (2006) <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/4875026.stm\">when David Cameron dismissed them as \"fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists, mostly\". </a>Now they are still a minor party and they don't have any MPs. But they came second in the European elections in 2009, they are level-pegging with the Lib Dems in the polls and they exercise a potent influence on Conservative party politics. Anyone interested in the British political scene would be foolish to ignore them.</p> <p>My colleague Martin Kettle explored this in detail <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/sep/19/ukip-force-shape-2015-election\">in his Guardian column yesterday.</a> He argued that, as the 2015 election approaches, there are two key reasons why Ukip matters.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The first is the Ukip factor itself. From 2009's 16.5% in the Europeans, Ukip slumped to 3.1% in the 2010 general election. A disastrous fall? Undoubtedly. The party crumpled.<br>But that 3.1% \u2013 still nearly a million votes \u2013 may have made some of the difference between a hung parliament and an outright Tory win. Small though it was, the Ukip vote exceeded the majority in 21 marginals the Tories failed to win in 2010, including Ed Balls's seat in West Yorkshire. If Ukip does as so many expect, and fares even better in the 2014 Europeans than in 2009, the Tory fear of a palpable Ukip effect in the 2015 general election will be even greater than before, even if Ukip's vote tanks again as it did in 2010. Any Conservative with a majority of 1,500 votes or fewer may be at risk.</p> <p>The second reason why Ukip success matters is because of Britain's place in post-eurozone crisis Europe. The competition between the parties on whether to promise an EU referendum \u2013 and, crucially, what question it would ask \u2013 is already intense behind the scenes. Every Ukip success is likely to push that competition further towards an in-out referendum pledge. Even if that does not come about \u2013 and a referendum on a less cut-and-dried choice of the sort that is apparently preferred by David Cameron would certainly cause problems for Ukip \u2013 the momentum of the whole process is towards increased UK marginalisation within whatever remains of the EU.</p> </blockquote> <p>At the Ukip conference in the Birmingham town hall today, the highlight will be the speech by Nigel Farage, Ukip's leader. Farage was on the Today programme at 8.10 this morning talking the possibility of a doing some kind of deal with the Conservatives before the next general election. I'll write a full post about his comments soon. He will be speaking at 11.45am.</p> <p>But I will also be writing about the rest of the conference too. It opens at 9.45am and the full agenda is <a href=\"http://www.ukip.org/page/conference-schedule\">here.</a> Ukip has in the past been vulnerable to charge that it's a one-man band, the Farage party, an outfit whose success is largely dependent on the efforts of one accomplished campaigner in a pin-striped suit. Today I want to see what the rest of them look like close up too.</p> <p>If you want to follow me on Twitter, I'm on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AndrewSparrow\">@Andrew Sparrow.</a> I won't be updating this blog quite as regularly as I normally do when I'm writing my daily Politics Live, but there should be updates at least every hour.</p> <!-- Block 2 --> <p>9.28am: <strong>Nigel Farage</strong> has been talking this morning about the possibility of Ukip doing some kind of deal with the Conservatives before the general election. His message has not been entirely clear.</p> <p>At Euston this morning I picked up a copy of the Daily Express. It's not normally the first paper I turn to in the morning, but it has become the Ukip house journal and, sure enough, there on page two was <a href=\"http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/347306/Ukip-leader-offers-a-poll-pact-with-Tories\">a story about the speech Farage will give today.</a> Here's how it starts.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>UKIP leader Nigel Farage will today make a dramatic offer to David Cameron to form a pact with the Tories at the next General Election.</p> <p>He will use his keynote speech at Ukip's annual conference to raise the prospect of an alliance at the polls.</p> <p>But he will demand in return the promise of an in-or-out referendum on Britain's membership of the EU.</p> </blockquote> <p>But then, when Farage was asked about this in his interview on the Today programme, this is how he started his reply.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><br>I haven't offered a deal at all. What has happened here is in Tory circles they fear that the Lib Dems will move to the Left and will head towards Labour, leaving the Conservative party very exposed. They look at Ukip at 10% in the polls and they say 'we've got to do a deal with Ukip'.</p> </blockquote> <p>Farage then went on the clarify his position, in a way that stands up the Express story. I've taken the quote from <a href=\"http://www.politicshome.com/\">PoliticsHome.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I'm responding to many voices within the Conservative party, and what I've said is we're a different party with a different manifesto, but if we were offered a deal that made it easier to push open a door marked 'independence for the United Kingdom' of course we'd consider it.</p> <p>But I wouldn't even contemplate doing a deal, even if it gave the party an advantage, unless we first had, written in blood I think, an absolute promise that we would have a proper referendum on our relationship with the EU.</p> </blockquote> <p>As Macer Hall says in his Express story, there are some Tories who want their party to form some kind of non-aggression pact with Ukip at the general election.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Tory Euro MP Daniel Hannan said yesterday: \"I'd like to move to a position where people who vote Ukip and people who vote Conservative at the moment can support the same candidates.\"</p> <p>Earlier this week, senior Tory MP Brian Binley wrote on his internet blog: \"Support for Ukip is growing. Conservatives and Ukip share a lot of common ground on Europe and a re-alignment with supporters of Ukip on the issue might also help win back some of the voters who abandoned us for them after the last election.</p> <p>\"We can't keep patronising Ukip as extremists. They represent the strength of feeling on an issue that is so important to the British people.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>But <a href=\"https://twitter.com/theresecoffey/status/248959181774807040\">on Twitter</a> the Tory MP <strong>Therese Coffey</strong> said that Farage seemed to rule out a pact with the Conservatives only five days ago, when he was interviewed<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b01mnqqz/Westminster_Hour_16_09_2012/\"> on the Westminster Hour. </a>She's got a point. I've been listening to the programme and this is what Farage said when he was asked if Ukip would stand down at the next election in seats where Tory candidates were calling for an in/out referendum on Britain's membership of the EU.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>No. Our intention is to fight every seat in the country at the next election. We are not just about Europe. We are about how we re-invigorate Britain once we've left.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 3 --> <p>10.20am: I've arrived. The press room at Birmingham town hall obviously doubles up as a broom cupboard, and so I'm inside the main hall itself, perched near the top of the balcony. According to Ukip, around 900 members are coming to the conference and there must be several hundred in the hall already. I couldn't get a seat downstairs. As I type, <strong>Mike Read</strong>, the former Radio 1 DJ, is speaking. He's already mentioned Churchill, and I've only been here five minutes. And he's winding up now.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It will soon be time to say once more: \"The long night of European darkness is over. Good morning, Great Britain.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>You get the gist ...</p> <!-- Block 4 --> <p>10.52am: Nigel Farage will be speaking in about an hour's time. Before he starts, here's a Farage reading list.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/jul/20/nigel-farage-ukip-leader-interview\">\u2022 Nigel Farage told the Observer in a long interview earlier this year that Ukip could trigger a realignment of British politics.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Can he imagine 20 more years of [campaign for a referendum on EU membership]?</p> <p>\"No. But I would think in the next four to five years we will either win the big question as far as we are concerned, or we will succeed in realigning a segment of the British political scene.\"</p> <p>An alliance with sceptical Conservatives?</p> <p>\"It's not completely impossible there will be some SDP-type moment, a coming together of different people over this one issue. Eventually, this question will have to be resolved.\"</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9543841/UKIP-axes-pounds-sign-logo-saying-it-has-won-the-battle-to-save-sterling.html\">\u2022 Nigel Farage told the Daily Telegraph in an interview last week that he wanted to ditch the pound sign as the party's logo.<br></a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Our pound sign has been a fantastically simple image. But now it is in my opinion represents a battle honour and not a forward looking aspiration for a party that wants to represent an independent UK.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/timstanley/100181226/nigel-farage-has-to-save-ukip-from-its-golf-club-eccentricity/\">\u2022 Tim Stanley at the Telegraph says Nigel Farage is the only person holding Ukip together.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The appearance of coherence is the genius of Nigel Farage. Farage is one of Britain's great everyman conservatives, with an innocent, unblinking expression that suggests a pug being gently squeezed from its middle. Like Boris or Nadine, \"Nige\" is an anti-politician. He visits lap dancing clubs, smokes, drinks and is alleged to have had an affair with a Latvian woman he met in a pub in Biggin Hill. The ordinariness defuses the potential extremism of UKIP's manifesto and injects some real world outrage into politics. There are too few conservatives like him left \u2013 men in camel hair coats who would abolish the income tax and swap the Channel Tunnel for a brick wall. But such is the power of Farage's joyful libertarianism that I wonder if UKIP would survive without him. It could either split into philosophical factions or, as it did under Lord Pearson, simply fail to generate attention.</p> </blockquote> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/19/nigel-farage-tory-donors-ukip?newsfeed=\" true\"\">\u2022 Farage tells Michael White in a Guardian interview that disillusioned Tory voters are turning to Ukip.</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9553120/Pinstripes-plain-views-and-areal-problem-for-Cameron.html\">\u2022 Paul Goodman in the Telegraph says Farage's long-term goal is to split the Conservative party.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The Ukip leader has had testicular cancer, led his party before, stopped leading it, nearly died in a plane clash (while campaigning during the last election to win the Buckingham seat held by the Speaker), and come back to lead Ukip again. In other words, he is a tough old thing who gives his turbulent party momentum by sheer force of character. His contempt for Messrs Cameron and Osborne would curdle low-fat milk but, significantly, doesn't extend to the older generation of senior Conservative politicians, of whom he speaks with guarded respect. His plan is evident: to gain the In/Out EU referendum that would split the Conservatives in half, and to realign British politics, much as the Common Market referendum of 1975 did.</p> <p>After all, a new force eventually emerged from the cross-party alliances formed during that referendum \u2013 the SDP. The Ukip leader evidently hopes that similar co-operation during another referendum would bring a similar outcome \u2013 that a No vote and Tory splits would divide the Cameroon leadership of the party from its base. The latter, joined with Ukip, would then morph to become the full-blooded Thatcherite party that even Lady Thatcher herself never quite led. Hence his recent decision to drop the party's long title and replace its pound-sign symbol. Hence, too, Ukip's support for grammar schools and opposition to gay marriage. Mr Farage is trying to wean his party off the EU issue alone, woo traditional Tory voters and park his guerrilla army on Mr Cameron's lawn.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 5 --> <p>11.16am: And here are some more lines from the various interviews that Nigel Farage has been giving this morning, in addition to the points he was making about the (very, very remote, it sounded to me) possibility of a pact with the Conservatives at the election. (See 9.28am.) I've taken the quotes from <a href=\"http://www.politicshome.com\">PoliticsHome.</a><br><strong><br>\u2022 Farage said he had more respect for Boris Johnson than for any other leading Conservative politician.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I have to say I have a great regard for Boris, he is the only leading Conservative figure who stands up and says things that many UKIP members agree with ... When I hear him talking about the City of London and the fact that it is a rather valuable asset, he is closer to us, but he's not quite UKIP yet.</p> </blockquote> <p><br><strong><br>\u2022 Farage said Ukip were rightwing on some issues and liberal on others.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think on economics, you can put us on the centre-right. But on issues of liberty - we're the party that believe in habeas corpus, we're the party that wants a smaller state. In that sense we're classical liberals.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that most people joining Europe were coming over to the party from the Conservatives.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think we have, since the last general election, got the Conservative party worried. A lot of people have come to us; some from the Lib-Dems, some from Labour, but the bulk that have come to us in the last two years from the Tories. They look at David Cameron and what they see is another brand of social democracy.</p> </blockquote> <p><br><strong><br>\u2022 He said Ukip's politicians had more real-life experience than the government's.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><br>I think people think we're being run by a bunch of college kids. They look at UKIP and think, well they may not be perfect, but at least it's led and full of people who've run businesses and got experience of life.</p> </blockquote> <p><br><strong><br>\u2022 He said Nick Clegg would probably be gone as Lib Dem leader within two years.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He claimed that schools do not teach pupils about British history or Christianity.</strong><br><strong><br>\u2022 He claimed that 75% of British laws originate from Brussels.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said that Ukip wanted to spend more money on defence because the cuts to the armed forces were \"absolutely shameful\".</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said too many 18-year-olds were going to university.</strong></p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said Ukip wanted a 31% flat tax on all incomes over \u00a311,500. National insurance would be abolished under Ukip, he said.</strong></p> <!-- Block 6 --> <p>11.33am: Farage claims that 75% of British laws come from Brussels. (See 11.16am.) But <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/RP10-62\">the House of Commons library has had a look at this issue and published a paper on it.</a> Its conclusion is different.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><br>All measurements have their problems. To exclude EU regulations from the calculation is likely to be an under-estimation of the proportion of EU-based national laws, while to include all EU regulations in the calculation is probably an over-estimation. The answer in numerical terms lies somewhere in between the two approaches, and it is possible to justify any measure between 15% and 50% or thereabouts. Other EU 'soft law' measures under the Open Method of Coordination are difficult to quantify as they often take the form of objectives and common targets. Analyses rarely look into EU soft law, the role of EU standard setting or self-regulatory measures.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 7 --> <p>11.38am: Back in the hall, <strong>Lord Hesketh</strong> is giving the warm up speech for Farage. Hesketh is one of Ukip's prize defectors; he was a minister in the Thatcher government and chief whip in the Lords under John Major, but left the Conservatives for Ukip last year. He mentions Neville Chamberlain (his grandfather was Chamberlain's PPS, he says) and he says Chamberlain deserves credit for keeping Britain out a slump in the 1930s because he spent money on rearmament. He says the whole of Europe is becoming disenchanted with a political class that cannot be trusted to tell the truth, and he suggests that Europe needs an 1848-style revolution.</p> <!-- Block 8 --> <p>11.53am: <strong>Nigel Farage</strong> is on the stage now. He starts by welcoming to the stage three councillors who have defected to Ukip from the Conservatives. And he welcomes to the stage <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19627027\">Lord Stevens of Ludgate, the former chair of United Newspapers, who joined the party this week.</a></p> <!-- Block 9 --> <p>12.00pm: <strong>Lord Stevens</strong> is speaking now. He cites David Cameron's quote about Ukip being full of \"fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists\". (See 9.15am.) It's a pleasure to join you, he says.</p> <p>He says he finally decided to join Ukip<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/9411876/David-Cameron-says-Britain-should-not-leave-EU.html\"> when Cameron told the Telegraph in an interview earlier this summer that he would never campaign for Britain to leave the EU.</a></p> <p>He says Britain could have a perfectly good free-trade agreement with the European Union. There should be an in/out referendum, he says.</p> <!-- Block 10 --> <p>12.07pm: <strong>Nigel Farage</strong> is speaking now.</p> <p>Something has changed, he says. At the general election Ukip got 3% of the vote. But now they are up to 12% in some polls, he says.</p> <p>What has changed? They have been lucky with their enemies, he says.</p> <p>But it is not about individuals. People look at the three parties. \"They look the same, they sound the same.\" And they look like college kids, he says.</p> <p>Ukip is run by people with some understanding of the real world.</p> <p>Ukip has also got better, he says. In the 1990s \"it was a bit shambolic\". But now it is more organised. It came second in the Barnsley byelection.</p> <p>The Human Rights Act has turned justice on its head. People want a debate on that, he says.</p> <p>People support Ukip because they see it as the voice of opposition on a whole range of issues, he goes on.</p> <!-- Block 11 --> <p>12.10pm: Farage says Ukip is \"not a one-trick pony\".</p> <p>It is reaching out to people concerned about things like windfarms.</p> <p>But Europe is the key issue, and it is rising to the top of the agenda.</p> <p>This week Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, the president of the European Commission, gave a speech that let the cat out of the bag. He used the f-word (federation) for the first time.</p> <p>The EU wants a constitutional change that would rule out the need for further referenda, he says.</p> <p>Farage says Barroso called him \"an extreme populist\". And he said Ukip was irrelevant to the main debate.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Well, Mr Barroso, it is Ukip's intention to make you eat those words.</p> </blockquote> <p>That gets the biggest round of applause so far.</p> <p>He says the new treaty proposed by Barroso is so extreme that no UK party would back it. Even the Lib Dems would not support it, he says.</p> <p>So a referendum on this question is inevitable, he says.</p> <p>People might argue that that is good news.</p> <p>But Farage says he is \"very worried\" by what he sees.</p> <p>From David Owen to Liam Fox, we now see the political class uniting behind a political position.</p> <p>There is growing support for allowing Britain to be part of a customs union with the rest of the EU.</p> <p>He says Cameron will propose a referendum on whether Britain should be part of the full federal EU, or whether it should just be part of a customs union.</p> <p>But this would stop Britain negotiating its own customs agreements with the rest of the EU, he says.</p> <p>Farage says he wants Britain to be able to have a free trade deal with the Commonwealth. (This gets a very big round of applause too.)</p> <!-- Block 12 --> <p>12.17pm: Farage says the EU wants Britain to have an \"open door\" to the whole of eastern Europe.</p> <p>That would be irresponsible with unemployment as high as it is.</p> <p>And Britain should not be subject to the European court, he says.</p> <p>That's why there needs to be a full in/out referendum.</p> <!-- Block 13 --> <p>12.19pm: Farage turns to the issue of a deal with other political parties.</p> <p>Some of the press reporting is wrong, he says. Ukip is a full, independent party.</p> <p>But Ukip would be \"silly\" not to consider something that might bring closer the chance of an in/out referendum.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><br>All this talk of a deal with the Conservatives has not come from me. It has come from the Conservatives.</p> </blockquote> <p>Clegg will go to Brussels before the 2015 election to replace Lady Ashton, he says. Under Vince Cable, the Lib Dems will float the idea of a deal with Labour. In those circumstances, if Ukip are 10% in the polls, the Tories will want to do a deal, he says.</p> <p>Farage says he has worked to build up Ukip. He would not do anything to jeopardise its identity, he says.</p> <p>Even if the Tories were to promise a referendum, that might not be enough. Some politicians do not keep their promises, he says. Any deal would have to be \"written in blood\".</p> <!-- Block 14 --> <p>12.23pm: Farage says Ukip has not yet made a breakthrough in local elections. But next year it will fight more seats than ever. And it will use those as a springboard for the European elections, he says.</p> <p>Ukip's goal will be to win those elections. He will work night and day to achieve that, he says.</p> <!-- Block 15 --> <p>12.26pm: The Farage speech is over. I will post a summary shortly.</p> <!-- Block 16 --> <p>12.58pm: The conference theme music seems to be XTC's \"Making Plans for Nigel\". They played it at the end of Nigel Farage's speech, and it has been blasting intermittently through the main hall ever since. It's almost as catchy and annoying as the Clegg \"sorry\" song.</p> <!-- Block 17 --> <p>1.20pm: Here are the main points from Nigel Farage's speech.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 Farage said that Ukip's priority now was to ensure that Britain had a full in/out referendum on membership of the EU, not just a referendum on Britain having a looser relationship with the EU.</strong> None of the main political parties is yet fully committed to an EU referendum, but David Cameron has strongly signalled that the Tories would call one after the next election and it is widely assumed that the plans to renegotiate the EU treaties in the light of the Eurozone crisis will eventually lead to British voters being given a say on any new arrangements. Farage said a referendum was inevitable. But it was not the referendum Ukip wanted, he said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I'm very, very worried about what I see. From David Owen to Liam Fox, what we're now seeing is the political class uniting around a position. The position is that we don't want to be part of this new federal superstate, but we do want to be part of the customs union, and we do want to be part of the single market and that there's nothing to fear from all those things because we won't be trapped inside a political union with Europe.</p> <p>Well, I've decided to take that on and I've launched a booklet called A Referendum Stitch-up. Because what is happening is remarkably similar to what happened back in 1975 \u2026 when you were told it was a common market. They are trying to do the same thing again.</p> <p>I think what Cameron will do, next week or the week after, is to say we can have a referendum on whether we join that full federal union, or whether we stay with the single market and a customs union. And that is a battle for us. We have got to go out there as a party and make the arguments. We don't want to be stuck inside a customs union that prevents us from making our own trade deals with the rest of the world, the growing parts of the world ... We in Ukip demand that this country is given a full, free and fair choice in a referendum, so that we can decide who governs Britain.</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>\u2022 He played down the prospects of Ukip entering into some form of electoral pact with the Conservatives before the general election. </strong>Ukip was an independent party, with its own agenda and its own candidates at elections, he said.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>But if an opportunity came which meant we could get this country closer to walking through a door marked 'UK independence,' if we had the opportunity to do something that was in our national interest, we would be silly not to even consider it.</p> </blockquote> <p>Farage said that talk of an electoral pact was coming from the Conservatives and that he personally would do nothing to \"sell this party short\".</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>The only way we would even consider a negotiation of any kind at all would be if first an absolute promise was made to give this country a full, free and fair referendum so that we could decide whether we remain members of the EU or not. That would have to be on the table before we even considered any proposal.</p> <p>And we would possibly have a problem even then. Some of you may have noticed that there are one or two people in politics who make promises and then break them. So I don't think a cast-iron guarantee would satisfy Ukip. At the minimum, it would have to be written in blood.</p> </blockquote> <p>What does \"written in blood\" actually mean? The only plausible interpretation must be \"written in statute\" - ie, the government would have to pass legislation before the 2015 election for a referendum afterwards. The chances of that are minuscule.</p> <p><strong>\u2022 He said Ukip's aim was to win the European elections in 2014.</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><br>By then we may well have the bones of a new treaty. We will have a political class doing their best to ignore the issue, doing their best to give us a fudged, stitched-up referendum. I think we will be in the driving seat for those European elections. I believe it must be Ukip's aim and goal to win those European elections in 2014, to cause an earthquake in British politics and to change the future of this country forever.</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 18 --> <p>1.58pm: In the past Ukip never used to receive much media attention, but this year it's rather different. There's a respectable media contingent, including the Today programme's Evan Davis and Channel 4 News' Michael Crick. Crick has been commenting <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MichaelLCrick/status/249101854796042240\">on Twitter.</a></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>One of great things about UKIP conference is how it glories in its eccentricity - Union flag ties, colourful waist-coats, great moustaches</p> </blockquote> <!-- Block 19 --> <p>2.22pm:<strong> Tim Congdon</strong>, the economist, has just finished addressing the conference. He has recently produced a 56-page report called How much does the European Union cost Britain? and it claims that EU membership costs Britain around 10% of GDP, or \u00a3150bn. It is the latest version of a report that Ukip has been producing annually and Congdon said that he wanted it to become \"the best document produced by a political party in the country\".</p> <p>So it's a shame that I can't find a link. There's <a href=\"http://www.betteroffout.net/the-uk-could-be-150-billion-a-year-better-off-out-of-the-eu/\">a brief summary at the Better Off Out website,</a> but I can't find a link to the whole thing.</p> <p>Congdon attributes half the cost - 5% of GDP - to regulation. I haven't had time to read the whole document, but his methodology seems open to challenge, to put it politely. In the chapter on the costs of regulation, he quotes an EU commissioner in October 2006 putting out a statement \"which invited the interpretation that the annual cost of EU regulation was 600 billion euros, or 5% of GDP\". Perhaps it invited other interpretations too, but I don't know because I have not had time to check. And the report also says that Peter Mandelson told the CBI in 2004 that EU red tape cost 4% of GDP. After a quick search, I've been unable to find the quote to back it up. Does anyone have the link? I used to cover CBI conferences regularly during that period and, if Mandelson did say that, I think I would have remembered.</p> <!-- Block 20 --> <p>2.49pm: <strong>Timo Soini</strong>, the leader of the True Finns party (a Ukip sister party in the European Parliament) has just finished speaking now. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/apr/21/true-finns-nationalist-populists-european-parties\">Their electoral success last year generated the kind of political earthquake, apparently, that Farage wants to achieve here. </a>His speech included references to at least two Tory heroes. Describing the Eurocrats as \"pillocks\", he praised Margaret Thatcher and inverted one of her best known sayings.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think they [the Eurocrats] hated your prime minister so much that they decided to do exactly the opposite in every single detail ... Where there is harmony, they will bring discord. Where there is truth, they will bring error. Where there is faith, they will bring doubt. And where there is hope, they will bring despair.</p> </blockquote> <p>He also ended by quoting Churchill: \"We will never surrender.\"</p> <!-- Block 21 --> <p>3.08pm: The economist <strong>Roger Bootle</strong> is addressing the conference now. He says that the creation of the euro was a mistake and that the best solution would be for Germany to leave. What's more likely to happen is that another country beginning with G (Greece) will leave, he says.<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18721155\"> Bootle, of course, won the Wolfson Economics prize for working out a method as to how this could happen.</a></p> <!-- Block 22 --> <p>4.05pm: So, what have we learnt? In news terms, I think I have already summarised the main points. (See 1.20pm.) But the attraction of coming to a party conference is to see what a party looks like close up and, in that respect, coming to Birmingham has been worthwhile. It is refreshing to come to a party conference that is not swamped by corporate lobbyists and PR executives in smart suits. There are none of those here, just hundreds of (mostly quite elderly) party activists. And, even if Ukip isn't your cup of tea, it is generally invigorating to spend time in an environment full of people with a passion for their politics and strong views. It's not always like that at the main party conferences.</p> <p>As for my conclusions, here are four things I've learnt.</p> <p><strong>1. Speculating about a Ukip/Conservative electoral pact is a waste of time because it is not going to happen. </strong>That is not to say I can promise not to write about the prospect. There are <a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/goldlist/2010/05/did-ukip-cost-the-tories-a-commons-majority.html\">a significant number of seats where the Ukip vote in 2010 was higher than the amount by which the Conservative candidate lost</a> and, as the election approaches, there is bound to be some kind of pressure for a deal \u2013 either seat-by-seat, or nationally \u2013 that would prevent a split in the Eurosceptic vote. But exactly the same kind of discussions took place before the 2010 general election, and they got nowhere. Even David Heathcoat-Amory, who was so Eurosceptic that he resigned as a minister from John Major's government over the issue, could not persuade Ukip to give him a free run. As he recalls bitterly <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Confessions-Eurosceptic-David-Heathcoat-Amory/dp/1781590486\">in his memoirs,</a> he thinks this led to him being defeated by the much more pro-European Lib Dem, Tessa Munt. Ukip seems too established as a party to want to contemplate these deals. Nigel Farage made this point in his speech and, if you read what he said about the possibility of a deal, it is fairly clear that he does not expect it to happen.</p> <p><strong>2. Ukip is not confident about winning an EU referendum. </strong>If, like me, you have not spent much time thinking about the difference between a free trade agreement and a customs union, you might think that Ukip (who want Britain outside the EU, but with a free trade agreement) would welcome the fact that the Conservatives want a looser relationship with the EU. But Farage clearly sees this as a threat and the most interesting part of his speech was the passage that dealt with this. (See 1.20pm.) He seems to think Cameron would find it relatively easy to win a referendum about whether Britain should remain in the EU as a member of a customs union.</p> <p><strong>3. The Conservative split has already happened.</strong> Earlier I quoted from an article by Paul Goodman, the former Conservative MP, saying that Farage seeks a fundamental realignment of British politics. But, after a day here, I sense that it has already happened. Ukip activists (with a few exceptions) are members of the broad Conservative tribe. They look like old-school Tories, talk like them and sound like them. Anyone who went to a Conservative party conference before they started to become anodyne in the mid-1990s would feel perfectly at home here.<br><strong><br>4. Ukip are not just a single issue party.</strong> I've heard plenty of Euro-bashing from the platform, but they have got strong views on other topics too. After Farage, the most interesting speaker in the morning was <a href=\"http://www.godfreybloommep.co.uk/policecommisioner.html\">Godfrey Bloom, the MEP who is standing against John Prescott in the elections for police commissioner in Humberside on what could safely be described as a Daily Mail platform:</a> anti-political correctness (there is a post on his blog entitled <a href=\"http://www.godfreybloommep.co.uk/news.htm\">\"Hate crime is not a crime\"), </a>pro-motorists (speed cameras would only be allowed near accident blackspots or schools) and pro shooting burglars (Bloom said he would take disciplinary action against any officer who arrested a householder for protecting his family). This is a party with a distinct libertarian agenda. Alexandra Swann, who defected to Ukip from Conservative Future, put it like this in her speech to the conference: \"I believe in more than independence from Europe. I believe in independence for the individual.\"</p> <p>That's it for today. I'm off for the train. Tomorrow I will be blogging from the Lib Dem conference, starting at around lunchtime.</p>",
  "<p>Violent anti-US demonstrations have erupted across Pakistan after a week of rising anger and the fateful decision by the government to declare a national day of protest against the US film that mocks Islam's prophet.</p> <p>Tens of thousands of people took to the streets of all major cities, with many protests descending into serious unrest that killed at least 15 people, injured around 120 and did significant damage to businesses.</p> <p>In street battles across the country, protesters threw objects at police, who retaliated with teargas canisters and live rounds, mostly shot into the air.</p> <p>Three people were killed in Peshawar, close to the Afghan border, as mobs attacked buildings, including a number of cinemas that were set on fire.</p> <p>One victim was the driver of a broadcast truck owned by the television network ARY who was caught in police fire. He later died of his wounds in hospital but not before the television station broadcast continuous loops of him in obvious pain being attended to in an emergency room.</p> <p>In many places crowds were able to break through barricades erected by police, who struggled to control mobs enraged by the blasphemous video Innocence of Muslims that sparked the crisis.</p> <p>Images streaming in from all over the country on Pakistan's cable news channels got steadily grimmer as what the government had billed as \"Love of Prophet Muhammad Day\" wore on and protests descended into street battles and looting.</p> <p>Mobile phone networks had been turned off in 15 cities in an effort to frustrate the ability of crowds to organise themselves, but it appeared to have no effect and services were restored well before the originally advertised time of 6pm.</p> <p>In Lahore the grand colonial-era Mall Road was the setting for skirmishes by demonstrators who also attempted to approach the US consulate in the city.</p> <p>In Karachi, where two people were killed, including a police officer, rioters torched police vans, looted shops and even attacked the port city's fire brigade.</p> <p>And for a second day running in the normally sedate capital of Islamabad violence was concentrated in front of the five-star Serena hotel, which is on a road that leads to the fenced entrance of the diplomatic quarter where the US embassy is located.</p> <p>While police succeeded in holding back the several thousand strong crowd they also battled to prevent more protesters entering the city from the south.</p> <p>\"America has challenged the Muslim nation by making this movie,\" said a 19-year-old called Mohammad Fayyaz, who kept his face covered as he joined the violence in the capital. \"We will not go until the man who made the film is hanged.\"</p> <p>The US embassy continued a vigorous campaign of public diplomacy, which in recent days has included television and radio adverts featuring the secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, emphasising that the US government had nothing to do with the production of the film.</p> <p>Yesterday the acting ambassador, Richard Hoagland, met government officials to once again reiterate that Washington \"condemned this video's content and its message\".</p> <p>Critics have lambasted the Pakistani government's decision to make Friday a national holiday, saying it was hijacked by hardline religious parties, many of them fronts for banned terrorist organisations, who used the national strike as a chance to demonstrate their street power.</p> <p>Raza Rumi, a prominent analyst and newspaper columnist, said the government had chosen a policy of appeasement.</p> <p>\"The government is under immense pressure to appear as Islamic and as pious as anyone,\" he said. \"But it could have chosen an alternative strategy of engaging with the various religious groups and launched a public campaign to educate people rather than letting them take to the streets.\"</p> <p>Earlier in the day the prime minister addressed a gathering of politicians and top clerics in Islamabad. He called for peaceful protests, but also used language likely to inflame the many protesters who have claimed the video is part of a plot involving Jewish, Israeli and US interest.</p> <p>\"It is ironical that denial of Holocaust is considered a crime but no consideration is paid to the feelings of Muslims,\" he said. \"I hope the international community and Islamic world will be successful in preventing such things.\"</p> <p>If the intention of the government was to burnish its Islamic credentials in the runup to an election in the next six months, many protesters were not convinced.</p> <p>\"[President Asif Ali] Zardari is a man with no grace, he should resign,\" said Tabarak Lateef, a 22-year-old protester in Islamabad. \"Our rulers are traitors, they are American slaves and they should be ashamed of themselves.\"</p>",
  "<p>Not too long ago, Chris Christie, the obstreperous governor of New Jersey, liked to tout something he called a \"Jersey Comeback\". But that phrase somehow didn't make it into his keynote speech at last month's GOP convention. And no wonder: <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-08-16/new-jersey-jobless-rate-increases-to-35-year-high-of-9-dot-8-percent\">unemployment in the Garden State is at a 35-year high</a> of 9.8% \u2013 the <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/web/laus/laumstrk.htm\">fourth-worst in the nation</a> \u2013 and unlike in the Rust Belt states or other hard-hit regions, in Jersey <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-pn-is-chris-christie-the-right-messenger-for-the-gop-on-the-economy-20120817,0,5660988.story\">unemployment is still climbing</a>. Poverty rates are also at their highest in years, <a href=\"http://www.northjersey.com/news/bergen/Census_figures_show_NJ_is_hurting_.html\">according to new census figures</a>. And this week, all three of the <a href=\"http://articles.philly.com/2012-09-19/news/33953413_1_economic-forecast-revenue-growth-budget\">big credit rating agencies lashed</a> the state's economic performance, with S&amp;P cutting its rating to negative and warning that Christie's budget was a thing of make-believe.</p> <p>New Jersey, in fairness, is a tricky state for jobs. Many Garden State folks work in New York or Philadelphia; the state government can only do so much. But if the jobs picture is complex, the fiscal disaster is made to order in Trenton (seat of the Christie administration).</p> <p>Christie's ludicrous budget, which he touted at the convention as a model of good governance, relied on an annual growth projection of 7.2%, higher than anywhere in the nation save California. Some might call that optimistic, others downright fantastical. </p> <p>Not only is projected growth coming in below that figure, by nearly a point, but even if growth had met Christie's target, that <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-09-19/n-dot-j-dot-needs-8-dot-2-percent-growth-to-meet-revenue-goals-rosen-says\">would still leave the state short</a> $258m, thanks to across-the-board corporate tax cuts. There was never anything balanced about Christie's \"three balanced budgets with lower taxes\", as he called them at the convention. And Jersey, it's now clear, is not coming back from anywhere.</p> <p>The Christie juggernaut is finally facing a backlash. And so the governor's trademark petty insults are now directed not only at his political opponents, but at anyone who even mentions that things are going south. Both the media and <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuA-2bJEtfQ\">Democrats are \"rooting for failure\"</a> if they point up that unemployment is up and revenues are down. And when the head of the state's nonpartisan office for budget analysis identified the massive revenue shortfall, <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-05-24/christie-turns-to-name-calling-on-n-dot-j-dot-revenue-report-shortfall\">Christie responded</a> in typically furious fashion. \"Why would anyone with a functioning brain believe this guy?\" he yowled, before comparing him to Dr Kevorkian.</p> <p>To anyone surprised by Christie's absurd governance and indifference to economics, all I can say is that this is nothing new. Christie first trumpeted his arrival on the national scene by cancelling, at the height of Tea Party anti-government fervor, the largest public works project anywhere in the United States: a vital new tunnel under the Hudson River 20 years in the making. The project had already broken ground when the governor unilaterally shut it down, fearing that basic, sorely-needed infrastructure would put state taxpayers on \"a never-ending hook\". (What does a never-ending hook look like?)</p> <p>Yet, according to a report this April by the Government Accountability Office, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/10/nyregion/report-disputes-christies-reason-for-halting-tunnel-project-in-2010.html\">Christie had grossly exaggerated</a> New Jersey's liability for the tunnel. He said the state would have to foot 70% of the bill; it was really under 15%. The governor had railed that costs were spiraling out of control; actually, they were unchanged for several years. Naturally, though, the <a href=\"http://nation.foxnews.com/gov-chris-christie/2012/04/13/watch-full-christie-speech-gw-bush-institute\">governor was unmoved</a> by this nonpartisan budget analysis. When it comes to public works, whatever the figures say, \"no matter how much the administration yells and screams, you have to say no.\"</p> <p>It was classic Christie to couch his ruthlessness on the tunnel project in the language of \"tough calls\" and \"hard choices\" \u2013 a theme he returned to in his recent convention speech, where he laughably opined that politicians have \"become paralyzed by our desire to be loved\". To every self-serving dismissal you can trust Christie to impute the highest degree of righteousness. (In this, he has a friend in Paul Ryan, <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2011/POLITICS/04/05/ryan.budget.proposal/index.html\">who likes to insist</a> that his oligarchical deception of massive tax cuts and the gutting of every public sector program outside the military is a \"moral imperative\" for \"our children and our grandchildren\".)</p> <p>But what tough call did Christie make with the Jersey cash earmarked for the tunnel? He put it into a transportation fund so he could <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/04/11/chris_christies_gas_tax_foolishness/\">keep the state gas tax</a> at an absurdly low rate \u2013 the third-lowest rate in the nation, less than half that of New York, and unchanged since 1988. Critically important infrastructure or a couple of pennies less on a tank of unleaded? As he says, it's a tough call.</p> <p>Enough, you might think, to make a New Jersey voter miss <a href=\"heaven_can_wait_rzIVCJVENUl8mgCezXBUCJ\">Jim McGreevey</a> and <a href=\"http://articles.cnn.com/2002-09-30/politics/elec02.nj.s.torricelli.race_1_robert-torricelli-bradley-and-frank-lautenberg-republican-doug-forrester?_s=PM:ALLPOLITICS\">Bob Toricelli</a>, the state's former champions of political malfeasance. And yet, such is the condition of American politics that this man \u2013 who, in case you forgot, also has trailing behind him the voluminous baggage of <a href=\"http://2012.talkingpointsmemo.com/2011/10/chris-christies-presidential-baggage.php\">abuse of power scandals</a> that would spell doom for most politicians \u2013 remains the presumed standard-bearer for the Republican party in 2016.</p> <p>He is a smart enough political operator to know that the Romney campaign is capsizing. He denies reports that he turned down the VP slot out of fear of failure, but during his impressively self-serving keynote address at the GOP convention, he failed to mention Romney until 16 minutes into a 24-minute speech. <a href=\"http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2012/09/gov_christies_approval_rating.html\">His approval ratings remain high</a> in reliably blue territory, and more than half of New Jerseyans say their traumatized state is heading in the right direction.</p> <p>So what Christie, and we, are learning is that he doesn't need Romney or anyone else to succeed. He doesn't need to be a successful governor, or even a minimally competent one. Fill the role demanded by central casting \u2013 the hard-driving tax-slasher with no time for niceties \u2013 and there will be enough insulation, in the party and in the media, to withstand even the most dismal economic performance. He may be a bully rather than a leader, but Christie is savvy enough to know which gets to you to the top.</p>",

The ad was produced by Secure America Now, a hawkish non-profit organisation, without the consent of the Israeli prime minister's office.</p> <p>Ayalon told the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organisations that he wanted to set the record straight in case there was any \"misreading\" of Israel's intentions. The current \"noise\" over US-Israel relations was a result of \"not very well judiciously planned remarks from both sides\" being misconstrued. On the issue of Iran, Israel and the US \"see eye to eye\", Ayalon said.</p> <p>Relations between the US and Israel have been severely strained in recent weeks over the issue of how to deal with Iran's nuclear programme. Netanyahu has publicly demanded that the US sets clear \"red lines\" beyond which it would take military action to destroy Iran's nuclear facilities. The US has declined to do so.</p> <p>After a press conference at which Netanyahu said that without red lines there could be no \"red light\" to unilateral military action by Israel, he and Obama spent an hour on the phone in an attempt to repair the breach. But officials in Jerusalem subsequently claimed that the White House had rejected a request for a face-to-face meeting when Netanyahu visits the US next week. US officials denied this version of events.</p> <p>Obama's opponent in the election, Mitt Romney, has adopted a significantly more hawkish stance on Iran. Netanyahu's warm relationship with Romney contrasts with the froideur between him and Obama.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Israeli foreign ministry said he could not confirm the veracity of Ayalon's remarks.</p>",
  "<p>The UK Independence party (Ukip) would only be prepared to make a pact with the Conservatives at the next general election if David Cameron's party made a promise \"written in blood\" to hold a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU, Nigel Farage has said.</p> <p>Speaking ahead of his <a href=\"http://www.ukip.org/\" title=\"\">party's annual conference in Birmingham</a>, the Ukip leader said that, while he hadn't offered a deal to any other party, he would be willing to consider one if either the Tories or Labour came to him with a \"sensible\" proposal.</p> <p>He said many Conservatives were uneasy at Ukip's rise in the polls and feared they would be left \"very exposed\" at the next election. But any agreement would only be reached if there was \"an absolute promise\" that an in/out referendum would be held. Polls suggest that in the event of such a vote, Britain could leave the EU.</p> <p>Farage <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_9753000/9753664.stm\" title=\"\">told BBC Radio 4's Today programme</a>: \"I'm not offering a deal to anybody; all I'm saying is if the Conservative party or the Labour party came to me with a sensible deal that worked in the national interest we would sit down and talk about it.\"</p> <p>Recent polls have given Ukip around 10% of the national vote \u2013 about the same as the Liberal Democrats. While its performance at first-past-the-post Westminister elections is not strong, observers say Ukip could potentially come second or even top in the 2014 European parliamentary elections, which use a proportional representation voting system.</p> <p>Asked if Ukip would agree not to field candidates against Tory eurosceptics as part of any hypothetical deal, Farage refused to be drawn on the \"specifics\". But he said any agreement would be expected to get the party its first MP in the House of Commons.</p> <p>He added: \"They [the Tories] look at Ukip at 10% in the polls and they say: 'We've got to do a deal with Ukip.' So I'm responding to many voices in the Conservative party and what I'm saying is, we're a different party with a different manifesto but if we were offered a deal that made it easier to push open a door marked \"independence\" for the United Kingdom, of course we'd consider it.</p> <p>\"But I wouldn't even contemplate doing a deal, even if it gave the party advantage, unless we first had written in blood, I think, rather than a cast-iron guarantee, an absolute promise that we would have a proper referendum on our relationship with the EU.\"</p> <p>He acknowledged that many in Ukip would find it hard to trust the Tories on the issue after Cameron \"reneged\" on an earlier vow to hold a referendum on the Lisbon treaty changes.</p> <p>The prime minister is facing internal divisions over the EU as many of his own MPs push for a referendum on membership during the next parliament.</p>",

  "<p>It is often said,and usually true, that by the time the world becomes fascinated with a particular trend, then those at the cutting edge have already invented the next big thing.</p> <p>The hot device on the stands for the 50,000 television executives at this month's IBC broadcasting technology get-together in Amsterdam was the connected TV, but the true trendsetters were discussing connecting everything. That is, not just syncing your laptop or your mobile to your favourite TV programme, but how to create a new eco-system of connectivity that will involve most of the electronic devices in the home, including the fridge.</p> <p>Among those thinking this was the new executive vice-president of global media for Samsung Electronics, David Eun, who gave his first official appearance in his new role at IBC where he fleshed out an all-embracing vision with, of course, Samsung devices at its heart.</p> <p>As the head of the new global media group and an adviser to the president of Samsung's mobile group, Eun is a leader in the concept of creating a new means of electronic distribution that encompasses more than just the obvious communication devices. Currently, the hype is about all the entertainment screens (such smartphones and laptops and, increasingly, televisions) being connected to the internet, but Eun sees a bigger picture \u2013 all of those devices and more being connected to the internet and to each other.</p> <p>Samsung is not the only consumer electronics firm to be thinking beyond hardware \u2013 LG and Sony have also launched smart TVs loaded with apps as well. But Eun is well-placed to have this kind of a strategic vision because Samsung sells a lot of screens: it has been the leading seller of TVs for seven years now, which is more than Sony, and in the US Samsung sells more each year than its next three competitors combined. The company has also more recently become a powerhouse in mobile phones, outselling Apple's iPhone for several quarters, which has only added to the acrimony between the two companies over patent disputes, especially since the recent US court decision this summer that went against Samsung, awarding Apple $1bn in damages. Samsung's latest smartphone, the Galaxy 3S, shipped 20m in its first 100 days, while Apple's new iPhone 5 sold out online two days after its 12 September launch.</p> <p>Eun won't discuss the patent suit, saying that he sees his job to build on Samsung's device distribution prowess. \"All these screens are connected to the internet but they are not yet all connected to each other,\" he said. \"Once we connect all these devices to each other we will effectively have one of the world's largest platforms for distribution content, services and advertising.\"</p> <p>The question is can Samsung create an \"ecosystem\" of software, hardware, services and customer support with the same kind of success as Apple? According to David Mercer, vice-president of digital consumer practice at Strategy Analytics, Samsung has not yet proven that purchasers of its TVs will also remain loyal to the brand enough to also purchase a Samsung tablet and mobile phone. \"The different branches of the company need to work better together in consumers' minds,\" said Mercer.</p> <p>Eun, a 45-year-old Korean-American and a former executive at AOL, Google and NBC, was employed by Samsung only in January, but has since begun to set out his stall to help take the South Korean electronics giant in a new strategic direction in terms of its future focus. Of course, Samsung will continue to manufacture and innovate its hardware products \u2013 it spent $9bn on R&amp;D last year alone \u2013 but he is also thinking about the company's software developments and he's been meeting with companies and creatives around the world to match up relevant content and services that can be tapped into via the company's own device network. He is also talking about making some strategic investments in companies with services or software that will help build up the appeal of Samsung devices. He said he spends as much time in New York and Silicon Valley as we does in Korea and clearly with the trip to Amsterdam he is looking at Europe as well for both partnerships and acquisitions to build on the approximately 2,000 apps that Samsung already has on its \"Smart Hub\" on its connected TVs. \"Samsung hasn't had to do lots of acquisitions historically because of its scale and share of talent,\" Eun said. \"But acquiring other companies is a way for us to accelerate our entry into the content services space.\"</p> <p>Eun talks a lot about the \"power of the distribution network\", ie the ability to sell lots of devices quickly. One reason for this is that Samsung has embraced a more \"open\" ecosystem than Apple in terms of its approach to payment and content, using both Google's Android and Microsoft's Windows 8 as well as a new alliance with Intel called Tizen, which is an HTML 5-based platform for apps. \"At Samsung I have understood the importance of distribution and the importance of proximity to the user,\" said Eun. \"One the things that has blown me away about the opportunity is that Samsung creates more devices \u2013 and so we have more touch points with consumers \u2013 than virtually any other company on the planet.\"</p> <p>And for Eun it's not just the usual TV and phone suspects he is talking about, but other white goods products like refrigerators and windows, which Samsung also makes. \"We already have windows that are also displays and they have virtual shades,\" explained Eun. \"There is a world, and it is not far away, where the mirror above the sink in the bathroom is a display and is connected to all the other devices that we make.\" Eun says that he already can see the day when his young kids say to him: \"Daddy do you really mean you used paper and magnets on the refrigerator to communicate with Mom? Why didn't you just put a screen there?\"</p> <p>With his background in Silicon Valley, Eun is also keen to see the TV set evolve into a more easily updateable device and he spoke at IBC about Samsung's development of an \"evolution kit\" for that will be used to upgrade TVs already in the market to move them more to the kind of replacement cycle more typical of smart phones, laptops and tablets. \"Our TV sets are increasingly modular,\" said Eun.</p> <p>Samsung may be thinking outside of the box about connectivity ideas for the near future, but the company is certainly not alone. The demand for smart technology devices is increasing almost exponentially \u2013 the demand for connected devices is booming, while second-screen app providers like Shazam and Zeebox are causing a stir in terms of pushing the current boundaries of connected and socialized content. \"Regardless of where you start now \u2013 on the content or on the hardware side \u2013 you need to understand both,\" said Eun. \"There is no silver bullet but there are important paths to pursue and that's what we are doing.\"</p> <p><em>Kate Bulkley is a journalist and media commentator.

  "<p>Elizabeth Warren and Scott Brown showed why the US Senate race in Massachusetts is one of the most closely watched in the nation, as the two candidates skilfully sparred and jabbed throughout their <a href=\"http://www.boston.com/politicalintelligence/2012/09/20/scott-brown-elizabeth-warren-use-face-face-debate-amplify-themes-from-senate-trail/xbHOMMgcjrxdkQFYkM3r0J/story.html\">first debate</a> in what was a toe-to-toe contest.</p> <p>Both candidates displayed considerable ability as debaters, although Brown, the Republican incumbent, was willing to mix charm with mud-slinging, quickly ridiculing Warren's disputed claims to Native American heritage: \"Professor Warren claimed that she was a Native American, a person of colour and as you can see, she's not.\"</p> <p>Brown's remark was a reference to a controversy over Warren having represented her heritage without evidence, which Warren blames on \"family stories\" and denies any professional gain.</p> <p>Warren remained unflappable in the face of Brown's provocations, and at each point in the fast-moving debate hammered away at Brown's voting record in the US Senate, nailing him to extreme Republican positions on the economy, energy, climate change and women's rights. \"Senator Brown can say all he wants. But he has voted,\" Warren said.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Brown strained to paint Warren as \"obsessed\" with raising taxes while trying to show her career in an unflattering light.</p> <p>On women's issues, Warren pointed to evidence of Brown's voting record as exposing the gap between his words and deeds. But Brown defended himself by saying: \"I've been fighting for women's rights when I was six years old when my mother was being abused by one of my stepfathers.\"</p> <p>Choosing to address his opponent as \"Professor Warren\" throughout, Brown's most outrageous remark came towards the end of the debate, when the candidates were asked about graduate unemployment. Brown launched into a rehearsed reply about the high cost of university tuition, which he turned into a reference to Warren's $300,000 salary from Harvard \u2013 suggesting that Warren's own pay was the cause of the rising cost of college tuition.</p> <p>Throughout the debate Brown bristled aggressively while managing to maintain an air of good humour and faint praise, while carefully blending in his support for positions popular in Massachusetts that are opposed by the Republican party nationally, such as abortion.</p> <p>Brown was eager to damage Warren's resum\u00e9, expansively attacking her for her part in asbestos claims settlements that Warren derided as wrong. When Warren voiced support for her former Harvard colleague Elena Kagan as US supreme court justice, and noted that Brown opposed her nomination, Brown sniped: \"I'm sorry I didn't vote for your boss.\"</p> <p>Warren's response was to yoke Brown to the Republican party of Mitt Romney and climate change deniers such as Senator James Inhofe, pointing out that GOP control of the Senate would put Inhofe at the head of the Senate's environmental committee. \"You're not running against James Inhofe, you're running against me, professor\" was Brown's riposte.</p> <p>Neither side could credibly claim victory from the debate. Brown launched a few skyrockets and displayed his everyman image, even mentioning the pickup truck he drove to the debate. Warren, less well-known than the incumbent, gained visibility and showed she had nothing to fear from Brown's attacks. If anything, her earnest demeanour contradicted Brown's efforts to label her a \"radical\", as he did seven times in the hour.</p> <p>The pair have three more debates still to come, and on the evidence of this they should be just as entertaining.</p>"
