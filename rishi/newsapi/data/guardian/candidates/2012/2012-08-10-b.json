  "<p>Thomas Bernard McFeely could not have been more indignant. The Irish woman who has become the bane of his life, Theresa McGuinness, had challenged <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/31/tom-mcfeely-declared-bankrupt-ireland\" title=\"\">his UK bankruptcy</a>. \"As a&#xa0;British citizen I have always objected to being forced into bankruptcy in a&#xa0;foreign jurisdiction,\" he informed the high court in London in June. \"I maintain this is a&#xa0;breach of my human rights.\"</p> <p>The foreign jurisdiction in question is Ireland, where hollow laughter greeted McFeely's sudden declaration of Britishness. After all, this is a man who once believed so fiercely in his Irishness that he fought in the IRA. He refused to recognise the British court that sentenced him in Northern Ireland in the 1970s, went on hunger strike and was prepared to die in the notorious H blocks in 1980. He later broke from Sinn F\u00e9in to join the League of Communist Republicans. Then he became a&#xa0;multimillionaire property developer.</p> <p>McFeely is bankrupt in Ireland now and will be&#xa0;out of business for 12 years. He is embroiled in&#xa0;numerous other court proceedings. His Victorian mansion on one of Dublin's most expensive avenues has been repossessed by the&#xa0;state. He says it's because he's a \"Nordie\"; that he is a victim of southern Irish prejudice against northerners, exacerbated by the global economic crisis. Few, however, see him as a&#xa0;victim. McFeely&#xa0;needn't worry about a roof over his head. His creditors, on the other hand, include&#xa0;several hundred people who bought apartments from him in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/oct/26/priory-hall-ireland-raises-safety-fears-about-boom-developers\" title=\"\">Priory Hall</a>, a&#xa0;development deemed so dangerous it was evacuated with fire crews standing by.</p> <p>One Irish newspaper editorial recently said of McFeely that he lives on a \"different moral planet to the rest of us\". However, McFeely's planet is entirely recognisable as contemporary Ireland. His dramatic rise to wealth was encouraged and facilitated by successive governments of a&#xa0;Republic that each year commemorates the egalitarian ideals of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/from-the-archive-blog/2011/may/21/easter-rising-dublin-1916\" title=\"\">1916 Easter Rising</a>. A&#xa0;Republic that is, according to the findings of the&#xa0;recent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/feedarticle/10156832\" title=\"\">Mahon tribunal</a>, endemically corrupt.</p> <p>McFeely's spectacular fall is mirrored by those of dozens of other developers and bankers, many of whom are queueing up to take advantage of more lenient bankruptcy laws in the UK and the US. Some have hidden billions abroad. Those paying for the excesses of the Celtic Tiger are ordinary Irish people, such as the former residents of Priory Hall, who took out inflated 20- or 30-year mortgages just before the bubble burst.</p> <p>Ireland, puffed up for a decade on the success of its peace process and the booming of its economy, is now bust, a land of zombie banks, ghost estates and empty monster hotels. Irish sovereignty, fought for by generations, has largely been forfeited to the so-called troika of the International Monetary Fund, the European Central Bank and the European Commission.</p> <p>McFeely regards journalists as \"scum\". We meet at the headquarters of his main Irish company, Coalport. The building is on the edge of one of Dublin's grandest Georgian squares, but its large boardroom is as sparse as a prison cell. Grubby white walls, a basic table and chairs, a&#xa0;single poster of the Manhattan skyline. He takes the seat at the head of the table. He tells me he used to have antiques in the boardroom, but the sheriff took them. He fields calls. One, he says, is from a bank manager in Portugal, where he also has property problems.</p> <p>He was born in 1949, the eldest son in a&#xa0;Catholic family of 13, in Farkland, County Derry. His grandfather joined the British army and was injured in the first world war. His uncle was in the British marines and was killed in action. \"My&#xa0;grandmother never forgave the British army for taking her son. She was one hell of a lady. She&#xa0;had presence. Her daughter, my mother, was fairly militant.\" His father was a cattle dealer and more of a nationalist than a republican.</p> <p>McFeely says he will never forget the family home being wrecked during a raid by \"the B men\", members of the notorious unionist Special Constabulary. \"You'd have thought a bomb had hit the place.\" The \"B Specials\" were usually local&#xa0;men; the poet Seamus Heaney, also from Co&#xa0;Derry, called them \"<a href=\"http://www.cstone.net/~poems/twopohea.htm\" title=\"\">neighbours with guns</a>\".</p> <p>McFeely went to school in Derry. \"There were&#xa0;houses that were semi-derelict. It was primitive to say the least. I remember seeing roofs&#xa0;with the slates in a big hollow in the middle.\" He left school at 14 and worked with a farmer until he was old enough to get on to a building site. When he was 15, there was an election. He was sent out to vote for the nationalist candidate, but voted instead for the republican: \"I had a mind of my own.\" He served his time as a bricklayer, working from 7am till 9pm. \"Everything I've done, I was diligent at it. I&#xa0;was 'on the grip', paid by the brick.\"</p> <p>He went to England in 1968 and got work straight away. \"The 5th of October brought me back. It was typical of what I had learned all my life \u2013 we were a people to be put down in our own country,\" he says. He is referring to the violent attack by the police on a civil rights march through Derry. Discrimination was institutionalised in Northern Ireland but was particularly acute in Derry, shortly to be dubbed \"the capital city of injustice\" by Bernadette Devlin (then a leading civil rights campaigner and soon to become Britain's youngest ever woman MP). Housing was at the heart of it, with&#xa0;disenfranchised and unemployed nationalists living in poverty in desperately overcrowded slums.</p> <p>The Troubles had started, and McFeely pitched in: \"I would always have been up at the front of the riots where the hand-to-hand fighting went on.\" Though he has boasted of wielding a&#xa0;hatchet, he says he also listened to the speeches and particularly admired Devlin and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eamonn_McCann\" title=\"\">Eamonn McCann</a>. \"I was taken by the socialism. We were all downtrodden, even a lot of the Protestants, though they thought they were aristocracy.\" He&#xa0;stopped practising Catholicism in 1971. \"As&#xa0;Lenin said, it is the opium of the people.\"</p> <p>His activism quickly \"morphed into\" IRA involvement. \"It was a way of getting back at the state.\" Facing six months in jail, he went on the run in the Republic, but missed the action and his fiancee: \"I couldn't stay away.\" He got married and had two daughters. He set out to bomb the new dole office in Antrim, where he had bought a house. There was a chase, he was cornered, punched a policeman in the face, escaped, went on the run in the Republic, got caught, was jailed, escaped again. \"I went back to the north,\" he says, \"which was hot and heavy.\"</p> <p>He knew <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/martin-mcguinness\" title=\"\">Martin McGuinness</a>, who admits he led the IRA in Derry at the time of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/bloodysunday\" title=\"\">Bloody Sunday</a> in 1972, but claims to have left by 1974. \"Martin was game. Martin was all right. It's not like him to leave in the middle of a good row,\" McFeely says with heavy sarcasm.</p> <p>McFeely was not, he says, involved in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/blog/2010/aug/24/claudy-bombing-report-priest-northern-ireland\" title=\"\">1972 bombing of Claudy</a>, a few miles from his childhood home. Nine people were killed, with no warnings given. \"But if I'd been there I would have planted the bombs. It is the reality of war. I&#xa0;only regret I wasn't able to do more.\"</p> <p>After carrying out an armed robbery on a post office, he and another IRA man took over a rural house, which was put under siege by the security forces. \"It was a bit wild west, to be honest. The idea was to go out and take as many of them out as possible.\" He shot a policeman (who survived) and when he eventually gave himself up, he expected to be shot dead. He got away with \"a&#xa0;fair decent beating\" but was sentenced to 26 years in 1977 by a judge who called him \"an extremely dangerous, intelligent and vicious young man\".</p> <p>McFeely puts his head in his hands when asked about his prison years. \"What do you tell? You got booted around, the screws would come in with drink on them and raid the cells, they'd spit on your food, you'd to walk naked, they'd set the dogs on you\u2026 There was fear, humiliation. I was in for the fight \u2013 I'd give the screws a damn good kicking.\"</p> <p>Screws were prison officers, mostly Protestants. He names one, \"the only evil man I ever met\", and says he is still glad he \"died a horrible death, a bomb under his car \u2013 he was mangled\". McFeely's violence meant he spent a lot of time \"on the boards\" (in solitary confinement).</p> <p>After the British ceased to recognise IRA members as political prisoners, McFeely was the OC (officer in command) of those who refused to wear the prison uniform and went \"on the blanket\". This escalated into the \"dirty protest\". The prisoners stopped washing; they urinated in their cells and smeared excrement on the walls. Soon the cells were crawling with maggots and prison officers wore gas masks against the stink.</p> <p>McFeely, described by another IRA prison leader as \"a very, very strong character\", was one of seven chosen to go on hunger strike, and was regarded as probably the most determined of them all. His face, gaunt, young, rakishly handsome back then, was on the posters that were carried on demonstrations in Belfast, Dublin and London. Halfway through, another prisoner described seeing McFeely: \"It was frightening. He looked like a skeleton with skin pulled over him.\" After 53 days, with one man about to die and rumours of a deal with the British, the hunger strike was called off. McFeely was blind, and furious. He vehemently opposed the decision.</p> <p>He is still full of rage about what happened. The deal was useless \u2013 the hunger strike had failed. When a new one began, the leadership refused his offer to go on it. \"I had no role after that.\" The demoralisation was \"absolutely terrible\". Violence inside the prison and out on the streets continued. Ten men died on the hunger strike. Along with another ex-hunger striker, Tommy McKearney, McFeely split with Sinn F\u00e9in to set up&#xa0;the League of Communist Republicans.</p> <p>Essie Kealing was a working-class hero. She lived in a flat in a complex that had been built for Dublin's poor by one of the 1916 revolutionaries. The flats were sold in the 1970s and Kealing led an eight-year rent strike to stop the landlord from evicting the tenants. In 1999, when she was 76 and had lived in her flat for 40 years, she received several visits from the new landlord, who attempted to persuade her to move out in terms that can be guessed at from her description of him as a \"rough merchant\". This was Tom McFeely, 10&#xa0;years after his release from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_%28HM_Prison%29\" title=\"\">Long Kesh</a> prison.</p> <p>Though he had not recognised the court, McFeely had appealed against his sentence and was released in 1989. His marriage had broken up. He moved to Dublin. He likes to tell the story of his first night, sleeping in his small car, almost penniless. Hired initially by other former IRA prisoners, he went back \"on the grip\", intent upon building up his fortune brick by brick.</p> <p>He was just in time to avail himself of minister <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%A1draig_Flynn\" title=\"\">Padraig Flynn</a>'s new light-touch regulatory regime which allowed \"self-certification\" of compliance with the law by architects, engineers and builders. Local authorities were empowered to carry out inspections, but in reality the pace of building was soon such that they lacked the resources to do so in more than a token number of cases.</p> <p>Successive <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fianna_F%C3%A1il\" title=\"\">Fianna F\u00e1il</a> governments laid out a&#xa0;range of tax breaks and schemes which, along with low interest rates and a striking absence of regulation, were designed to encourage speculators. A government minister praised the Irish \"frontiersmen\" mentality. The New York Times said Dublin had become known as \"<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/01/business/worldbusiness/01irish.html\" title=\"\">something of the Wild West of European finance</a>\". Many of those who profited bankrolled the party. McFeely says he did not. \"But if I'd been asked, would I have done it? Yes. I don't know anybody with a halo.\"</p> <p>Within a couple of years, McFeely had enough money to buy a pub back home in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungiven\" title=\"\">Dungiven</a>. He&#xa0;had no fear of authority. His modus operandi, if there was a finding against him in one court, was to appeal to a higher one. There were long-running legal battles with other major developers. \"I pushed it all in front of me. I&#xa0;never&#xa0;kept money,\" he says.</p> <p>He didn't part with it readily, either. Following a&#xa0;Criminal Assets Bureau investigation in 2006, he had to pay out more than \u20ac8m in unpaid taxes, dating back to his arrival in the Republic. The following year, Coalport was the subject of no fewer than eight high court proceedings. He took out a&#xa0;loan of \u20ac10m for his house, the former German embassy, but stopped paying the mortgage. In 2009 he was ordered to repay \u20ac6.2m to a bank, as well as a&#xa0;further revenue payment of \u20ac580,000.</p> <p>McFeely's companies built houses, apartments and commercial units all over Ireland, as well as in England. He maintained the tradition of employing ex-prisoners. An absence of building experience was not a barrier. During the boom, he freely admits, \"Everything was done in a rush. The attitude was get it up, get it off, get on to the next job. Come back and finish it later.\"</p> <p>In 2002, Theresa McGuinness liked what she saw of McFeely's plans for a small development in County Dublin and paid a cash deposit of \u20ac35,000 on a house. It was a decision that would come to dominate her life for at least the following decade. Within two years she was suing McFeely. \"You could see the house was a disaster by its roof,\" she said. \"It was literally sagging in the middle. Inside, you'd have thought someone had taken a&#xa0;hammer to the place.\"</p> <p>The signs were bad for Priory Hall right from the start. The development was part of the much-vaunted new Northern Fringe. \"The idea was to develop an extension to the city of Dublin with high-density housing and good public services and transport,\" says local TD <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Broughan\" title=\"\">Tommy Broughan</a>. Many of the top developers obtained sites. McFeely's was at the southern end of what was to have been the main boulevard through the new towns of Clongriffin and Belmayne. \"They call it the boulevard of broken dreams now,\" Broughan says.</p> <p>In 2004, a woman had just dropped her children at school and was driving home along the edge of McFeely's building site when her car was crushed by steel mesh grids weighing over a tonne. She was described as having narrowly escaped death. Two years later, another woman had a narrow escape when her car was hit by a section of scaffolding falling from the same site. A health and safety inspector said this was \"one of the most unsafe\" sites he had ever inspected. The high court ordered the site to be temporarily closed because of \"systemic\" breaches of regulations.</p> <p>In the years that followed, there were complaints about estates left in an \"appalling state\", roads unfinished, \"wires sticking out of the showers\", fire hazards. After Dublin city council brought McFeely to court over problems in an estate in west Dublin, the president of the high court said there had been \"clear unwillingness\" and \"foot dragging\" by the developer.</p> <p>Clongriffin today is a sorry sight. There's a&#xa0;forlorn railway station, but most of the promised facilities were never developed. Some estates are half-empty, while others have been half-built, then abandoned. Roads end in hoardings. One&#xa0;has \"Drug dealers out\" scrawled on it.</p> <p>One public housing tenant at Priory Hall was taken to hospital because of the damp soon after it opened. Just before Christmas in 2009, the council moved its tenants out after fire inspectors deemed the buildings dangerous. Broughan demanded a debate in the Irish parliament about the \"outrageous situation\", pointing out that \"key planning and building regulations\" had obviously been ignored. McFeely undertook to do works.</p> <p>One owner agrees to take me round and talk about what happened on condition that I do not use his name. McFeely's reputation as a \"rough merchant\" has not diminished. (In May, a London high court judge found there was a \"strong suggestion\" that, based on a sham lease he had helped to devise, McFeely had received almost \u20ac4m in rents for a building near the Olympic Village in Stratford, and that he and others had intimidated the directors of the leasing company.)</p> <p>\"My wife and I bought off plans in 2005,\" the apartment owner says. \"It was our first home together. The apartments were expensive but this was the peak of the boom and the banks were throwing money at people. We brought in a&#xa0;surveyor but he was refused access.\"</p> <p>The security man on the locked-up site lets us in and we climb stained, carpeted stairs to the apartment. The living room window looks out over the abrupt end of the road and a mound of grassed-over rubble at the edge of waste ground where the boulevard was meant to be. \"We kind of knew from the start the place was blighted,\" the man says. \"The car park was always flooded. The place was damp. One morning we were woken by a&#xa0;knock on the door and it was the young couple downstairs. Their ceiling had fallen in. Sewage pipes went nowhere \u2013 just ended. We were paying a management fee but nothing was getting done.\"</p> <p>Then, one morning in October 2011, the man was driving to work when he heard on the news that the city council had gone to court to get an order for the apartments to be evacuated. Insurance companies ceased cover. Fire crews stood by as residents packed cars and vans, and moved to hotels, spare rooms and rented apartments. The high court ordered the council to pay for their accommodation \u2013 it has since appealed against this.</p> <p>\"Self-regulation is outrageous,\" the man says. \"It turns out McFeely declared the complex to be 'in substantial compliance' with all the rules and regulations, and the council just accepted that. It was crazy \u2013 we first set eyes on McFeely in court. He called us begrudgers and 'jumped-up little Hitlers'.\" One resident shouted back at the builder that he \"couldn't build a snowman\".</p> <p>At first, it was agreed that setting things right would take five weeks. Then a dispute blew up between McFeely and Dublin city council, which led to McFeely being arrested and briefly jailed, before he appealed to the supreme court, which found in his favour. When the council made public its enforcement order, the owners knew the place was doomed. \"There were 18 pages of items, most of them very serious. Basically, nothing was right.\"</p> <p>\"They crucified me,\" McFeely says of the massive tax settlement he had to make with the Criminal Assets Bureau. Having paid, he went straight out and bought a Bentley for nearly \u20ac50,000. \"I stuck my two fingers up at them. They thought they could destroy me. I'm getting hammered because I had the audacity to come down here and live on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ailesbury_Road\" title=\"\">Ailesbury Road</a>. It's the Free State mentality \u2013 I'm&#xa0;a Nordie with a republican reputation.\"</p> <p>It is certainly true that the wealthy of Dublin&#xa0;tend to be snobbish and that the huge made-in-the-H-blocks Celtic cross in McFeely's drawing room window looks incongruous. He is far from being the only local resident to be familiar with the inside of a courtroom, but is one of the few who has been in jail. His fleet of vehicles is normal for the area \u2013 though the Bentley has gone.&#xa0;\"I&#xa0;paid a lawyer with it.\" In fact, the McFeelys have been ordered to leave the house after his second wife failed to persuade the high court to let her remain there in her own right.</p> <p>McFeely says his building practices and standards are normal, and that he has co-operated with attending to any \"snags\" as required, though he disputes others' assessments of these.</p> <p>There is mounting evidence that he is right about standards \u2013 one large apartment block built by another developer has recently been evacuated as unsafe and it is likely that more will follow. \"A lot of the other developers are bad-mouthing me because they think I'm bringing the heat on them,\" McFeely says. \"But I'm no tout.\"</p> <p>He makes no apology for his British passport. \"I&#xa0;am still a republican, but I was born a British subject and I'm smarter than the rest of them. I&#xa0;fought for a socialist republic and I still believe in that. Blame the peace processers for copper-fastening the border. And by the way, you get better justice in the British courts.\"</p> <p>There is still a framed poster on the staircase of Sinn F\u00e9in's offices in Dungiven, near McFeely's old home, showing him among the 1980 hunger strikers. The museum upstairs is full of Troubles memorabilia, including a glass case containing a&#xa0;couple of AK47s and a 1977 poster demanding \"Break the connection with England \u2013 the source of all our evils\". But all has changed. Downstairs, at the front desk, there's the order of business for the Assembly at Stormont, where Martin McGuinness is now deputy first minister. The day I visit, the front pages have photos of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/jun/27/queen-martin-mcguinness-shake-hands\" title=\"\">McGuinness and the Queen shaking hands</a>.</p> <p>McFeely's old IRA comrades are loyal. They speak of the \"rare bond\" that exists between ex-prisoners. They say they don't know much about what he is accused of in the Republic. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-13593097\" title=\"\">Sean McGlinchey</a>, now Sinn F\u00e9in mayor of Limavady, says McFeely, still a good friend despite their political differences, \"never got over\" the end of the hunger strike. \"He is no angel, but we all have our faults, we all make mistakes.\" He admits McFeely was always aggressive. \"He wouldn't go around a thing \u2013 he'd go through it. He's a bull.\"</p> <p>Down the road in Derry, Eamonn McCann, who inspired McFeely all those years ago, is still a&#xa0;campaigning socialist. \"McFeely represents something almost stereotypical,\" he says. \"A&#xa0;republican who is a property developer and a&#xa0;landlord. There is a great deal of resentment against the political establishment in the Republic. Men like McFeely feel they have done intense things 'for Ireland' and they are entitled to some return. Of course, you have Fianna F\u00e1il ministers who have also acted as if the state is something to be treated with contempt.\"</p> <p>Theresa McGuinness has no interest in any of this. She has spent the past decade fighting through the courts, representing herself, to get McFeely to pay her back the money he owes her for the house she never got. She has been more assiduous than any state agency in her pursuit of him. \"This man has put me through a pure nightmare,\" she says. \"Why should I let him get away with it?\"</p> <p>McFeely is much debated on political websites. One contributor recently said of him, it's like \"all&#xa0;that's been wrong with this land for the last 40 years\" in one man.</p>",
  "<p>Throughout the week, news junkies like yourself are weighted with information the way the women of the US Olympic team are weighted with medals. But what is any of that worth? An Olympic medal can fetch up to $15,000 (US swimmer and eccentric hottie Anthony Ervin gave the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/29/sports/olympics/anthony-ervin-olympic-medalist-in-2000-comes-back-in-swimming.html?pagewanted=all\">proceeds of that sale</a> to victims of the Indian Ocean tsunami), but, as with political stories, most of the value invested in a medal is purely <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/story?id=100405&amp;page=1#.UCVKH2MsjGI\">sentimental</a>. This week, a brief look at a couple of stories you know about \u2013 and what they really mean. (PS Romney show horse Rafalca came in 30th. <em>Fact</em>.)</p> <p><strong>When did you stop killing that man's wife?</strong> By now, if you're the kind of person who's reading this article, you're probably one of the <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/10/already-viewed-by-scores-criticized-super-pac-ad-has-yet-to-air-as-paid-commercial/\">half-million</a> people who've seen the controversial Priorities USA ad featuring a man laid-off from his job after Bain Capital took over the company. The Obama Super Pac has yet to pay anyone to air the ad, but it is by far the most-talked about piece of campaign propaganda this season.</p> <p>You probably also know why that is: building upon the Obama campaign's most successful lines of attack \u2013 linking Romney to Bain to people losing their jobs \u2013 the spot adds at least one other loop of logic to the chain, joining Romney to Bain to job loss to cancer to death. </p> <p>The Romney team has been trying to point out that the trail of facts that connect Mitt Romney and steelworker Joe Soptic's tragic story are more complex and less concrete than the Obama ad implies. They're not wrong. In 993, Bain bought a steel mill in Kansas (adds Romney: he wasn't running Bain at the time!). Soptic became unemployed (Romney: he was offered a buy-out!). Soptic lost his health insurance; his wife lost her health insurance (years after Soptic lost his job!). She was diagnosed with cancer (far into the disease's progress); and then, yes, she died. The Romney camp has a point, but the Obama ad is ingeniously devious beyond a mere twist of facts \u2013 indeed, it's downright Rovian. Romney may be running a repeat of McCain's 2008 campaign, but the Obama team is channelling Bush's in 2004.</p> <p>There's the obvious: as far as political knife-fights go, once you start arguing about whether or not your candidate killed a man's wife, <em>you're already losing</em>. Then there's the way that debating the details of Soptic's story has kept Romney and his surrogates from hammering Obama on the economy.</p> <p>The sheer audacity of the ad has also forced the Republicans to resort to one of the least attractive tactics available: whining about what's fair. Americans don't like dirty politics and negative ads, it's true, but it can hardly sit well with the Republican base that Romney now wants to hand over control of the debate to the mainstream media, complaining to one <a href=\"http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/243029-team-romney-pressures-obama-to-denounce-controversial-cancer-ad\">interviewer</a> that \"the various fact-checkers look at some of these charges in the Obama ads and they say that they're wrong, and inaccurate, and yet he just keeps on running them.\"</p> <p>Yes, by all means, let's make campaigns pull every ad deemed inaccurate by journalists! Neither side would have many left. </p> <p>What's more, Romney campaign helped the Obama cause along by at first underscoring their point: given <a href=\"http://www.factcheck.org/2009/09/dying-from-lack-of-insurance/\">how many Americans die every year because they don't have cover (45,000)</a>, it's important to have health insurance! So important, in fact, that some states <em>mandate</em> it. The inappropriateness of Romney spokeswoman Andrea Saul reminding reporters that Mrs Soptic <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/79482.html#.UCKQfD_Xpmg.twitter\">would have had insurance</a> if she'd lived in Massachusetts made some analysts wonder if the whole ad was some kind of trap wandered into by an increasingly rudderless campaign.</p> <p>No less than noted authority on <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2010/12/07/halperin_elizabeth_edwards_hardball/\">bedside manner</a> Mark Halperin has said that the \"cancer ad\" oversteps some invisible line in <a href=\"http://thepage.time.com/2012/08/08/why-the-obama-super-pac-ad-is-different/\">political etiquette</a>, though I have no doubt that should Obama win (ads are only in bad taste if the candidate loses), the line will simply move. Should journalists take a stand on whether an ad \"goes too far\"? Is \"who will kill more people\" a useful metric for deciding one's vote? Should how they die matter? (Uninsured getting sick versus execution by armed drone?) I have no answers to these questions, which is apparently just fine because that's not the debate we're having.</p> <p><strong>These are not the vice-presidential candidates you're looking for.</strong> A further question: stopping the media from speculating on veep selections \u2013 is there an app for that? The only good thing about reporters tossing out names of possible vice-presidential candidates is that you can't accuse them of needing to do more reporting on it. It is functionally impossible to report on who Romney will pick to fill out the ballot because VP choices are one of the few modern political decisions that are truly personal. Polling data and focus groups play a role, but in the end, the nominee has to go with the person who feels right. As much as analysts say that carrying a home state matters, \"regional balance\" hasn't been a factor since the last civil war veterans died off. Thus, I've been arguing that the most important thing Romney's pick will tell us is what Romney thinks about himself. Call it an X-ray of the soul, though I suspect Romney's might be more an X-ray for a soul. </p> <p>If anything, the most chattered-about names \u2013 Paul Ryan, Tim Pawlenty, and Rob Portman \u2013 probably have less of a chance than they did before we started talking about them. Having a high public profile is pretty much a negative. On Friday, Romney spokesperson Eric Fernstrom told reporters asking about the process to \"download the app\". My gut feeling is that in Romney's perfect world, the VP would <em>be</em> the app.</p> <p><strong>And now for something completely different.</strong> American Conservative senior editor Rod Dreher, author of Crunchy Cons: How Birkenstocked Burkeans [\u2026], drew my attention to a <a href=\"http://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/i-miss-the-old-left-at-prayer/\">story</a> that's gotten very little attention outside Catholic circles, but is an interesting counterweight to the <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2012/08/10/672391/catholic-nuns-send-letter-to-romney-challenging-his-woeful-lack-of-knowledge-about-the-poor/\">media coverage of the band of nuns protesting</a> Romney's policy regarding the poor \u2013 and speaks to the future of the Catholic political tradition in the US.</p> <blockquote> <p>\"For the first time since the Vatican announced a crackdown on the organization, the Leadership Conference of Women Religious \u2013 the umbrella group that represents 80% of America's Roman Catholic nuns \u2013 met for its annual conference. For an organization under fire from Rome for its alleged theological heterodoxy, LCWR's choice of a keynote speaker was unusual: Barbara Marx Hubbard, an elderly New Age guru whose vacuous nostrums bring to mind a nitrous oxide aficionado who just rollerbladed in from the Venice boardwalk. Hubbard called the nuns 'the best seedbed I know for evolving the Church and the world in the 21st century'. Good luck with that.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Dreher contrasts the \"narcissism\" of the nuns' religiosity with the religious liberalism from generations past. Reflecting on LCWR's decline, he writes:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"The problem with today's religious liberalism is that it privileges individual desire and individual experience so radically that it gives away any solid ground from which it might stand to move the world and to change it. For that matter, how in the world are these nuns going to be the seedbed for any kind of change when they can't even convince anyone to join their own ranks?</p> <p>\"US membership in Catholic women's religious orders continues to <a href=\"http://ncronline.org/news/women-religious/studies-chart-diminishment-us-sisters-numbers\">plummet</a>: 90% of American nuns are aged 60 or older, and only 5% are under the age of 50. Perhaps Marx Hubbard expects that desiccated seedbed to grow magic beanstalks. In any case, the LCWR conference at least somewhat gainsays the popular narrative that the American nuns are innocent victims of a Vatican Inquisition seeking to impose rigid doctrinal orthodoxy on kindly old ladies who only want to serve the poor.\"</p> </blockquote>",
  "<p>Mitt Romney's campaign team mounted a counter-attack Friday over a controversial pro-Obama ad linking the Republican presidential challenger with a woman's death from cancer.</p> <p>The cancer ad is the most negative piece of campaigning yet, and has dominated the political agenda for three days. It overshadowed other issues at the daily White House press conference on Friday.</p> <p>The Romney camp put out an ad of its own, accusing Barack Obama of seeking to exploit the tragedy of the woman's death for political gain.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/z-EEETo3Sqo?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/z-EEETo3Sqo\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p></p> <p>Eric Fehrnstrom, a Romney campaign adviser, denounced the cancer ad, released on Tuesday. \"When you start running ads accusing your opponent of killing people, then you have lost credibility and I think that's where the Obama campaign finds itself,\" Fehrnstrom said. \"I don't think a world champion limbo dancer could get any lower than the Obama campaign right now.\"</p> <p>In the ad, paid for by one of the main Super Pacs backing Obama, Priorities USA Action, a former steelworker Joe Soptic recounts how when Bain Capital, which Romney headed, shut down his steel plant in 2001, he lost his family health benefits. His wife died of cancer five years later.</p> <p>Although Priorities USA Action insists it is not accusing Romney of being to blame for the woman's death, that is the implication: that the cancer might have been caught at an early stage if the plant had not closed and the Soptic family still had insurance coverage.</p> <p>The Romney campaign counters that the ad is inaccurate on several counts, not least that the woman had health coverage of her own.</p> <p>The White House is refusing either to endorse the ad or denounce it. Obama spokesman, Jay Carney, insisted that his campaign had no control over the actions of Priorities USA Action. \"We have no control over third-party ads,\" he said. Asked about whether the cancer link was appropriate in a political campaign, he said: \"It's not for me to do.\"</p> <p>Although Priorities USA Action insists it is planning to go ahead with airing the ad in swing states at a cost of $20m, it will have to decide whether the row is causing more damage to the Obama campaign than Romney's. It could make it harder for Obama to claim the moral high ground if, as expected, pro-Romney Super Pacs launch similar negative ads.</p> <p>One positive for the Obama campaign is that negative campaigning, while frequently deplored, usually works, and that Romney will be smeared by the ad anyway. The row is distracting voters from Romney's attempts to focus the election on economic issues.</p> <p>Carney claimed that there is no co-ordination between the Obama campaign and Priorities USA Action. But the founder of the Super Pac, Bill Burton, is a former White House spokesman, while David Plouffe, a senior White House adviser, was raising funds for the group earlier this year.</p> <p>An Obama campaign spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, while briefing reporters alongside Carney on an Obama campaign flight this week, initially denied the campaign knew anything about Soptic. It later turned out that he had appeared in an earlier campaign ad.</p> <p>The Romney ad issued on Friday says: \"What does it say about a president's character when his campaign tries to use the tragedy of a woman's death for political gain? What does it say about a president's character when he had his campaign raise money for the ad then stood by as his top aides were caught lying about it?</p> <p>\"Doesn't America deserve better than a president who will say or do anything to stay in power?\"</p>",
  "<p>Americans don't do self-deprecation. Whether it's the world's biggest ball of string or the grandest canyon or the fastest swimmer or the bounciest gymnasts, when we do something great we want everyone to know about it. Which doesn't always make us popular. Or trustworthy. In Texas, where hyperbole is second nature, they talk about a person being \"all hat and no cattle\".</p> <p>But as Londoners have discovered, being all cattle and no hat is no picnic either. Grumbling is the British national pastime, so it was hardly surprising that the months before the Olympic opening ceremony saw commentators loudly complaining about the impending nightmare as the much-abused London transport system struggled to cope with the hordes of spectators. Not to mention the queues at Heathrow.</p> <p>The brace position even applied to your sporting expectations. Yes, British athletes had done very well in Athens and Beijing. Some of them were even coming back for a third helping \u2013 and this time you would have a home field advantage. Still, curbing your enthusiasm seemed to come naturally. So for the first few days, when Britain's medal haul was still looking a bit spare, and the weather looked like it might revert to type, Londoners seemed almost happy preparing for the worst.</p> <p>Of course you didn't mean it. I've lived in Britain long enough to learn that \"muddling through\" is Brit-speak for what any other culture would describe as cheerful, efficient competence. But when it turned out lots of other people did believe you \u2013 with the Daily Mail revelling in photos of <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2181313/Deserted-London-2012-Shops-theatres-businesses-visitor-levels-fall-THIRD-fears-Games-travel-chaos.html\" title=\"\">empty streets and shops</a> \u2013 the nation became briefly caught up in the comfortable, inevitable process of distributing blame. But what happens now that British athletes have done the country proud, the games are set for a stunning success \u2013 and Danny Boyle may have single-handedly saved the NHS?</p> <p>First of all, try to enjoy what remains of these games. Visitor numbers may have been below expectations, but after the last two weeks the whole world knows that while the weather may be unpredictable, London has the kettle on, the welcome mat out, the vacancy sign lit up and a fridge full of cold beer (for those of us who like it that way) ready for guests.</p> <p>No matter what Mitt Romney may think, the global audience has also been reminded of why London won the Olympics in the first place: it's one of the most diverse cities on the planet with more different kinds of people eating more different kinds of food and wearing more different kinds of clothes and playing more different kinds of music than just about anywhere else.</p> <p>No matter where you come from, you can be sure that someone in London speaks your language. If that sounds like hyperbole, you can sue me. The fact that London is nothing like Salt Lake City is all to the good.</p> <p>While we're at it, perhaps it's time to give the whole self-deprecation thing a rest. Sure it's funny to fool us foreigners. And clearly some people find the shy-bumbling-stammering-incompetent act charming. But it seems like the days when the superiority of everything British went without saying have gone \u2013 and with them the assumption that constant complaints about life in what is after all one of the most prosperous, most pleasant, most civilised of cities couldn't possibly be meant to be taken seriously.</p> <p>My kids' friends have a set of hand signals for socially problematic occasions, ranging from the \"awkward turtle\" \u2013 when the subject of gossip suddenly enters a room \u2013 to the \"casual racism swan\" for remarks too obnoxious to just let pass but not worth a major confrontation. Maybe someone should invent a self-deprecating duck? Or an ironically insincere elephant? Until then, you'll just have to say you didn't really mean it.</p>",
  "<p>The shock of losing a precious job in a town afflicted by high unemployment is always hard. A foundation for a stable family life and secure home instantly disappears, replaced with a future filled with fears over health insurance, missed mortgage payments and the potential for a slip below the breadline.</p> <p>But for Bonnie Borman \u2013 and 170 other men and women in Freeport, Illinois \u2013 there is a brutal twist to the torture. Borman, 52, and the other workers of a soon-to-be-shuttered car parts plant are personally training the Chinese workers who will replace them.</p> <p>It's a surreal experience, they say. For months they have watched their plant being dismantled and shipped to China, piece by piece, as they show teams of Chinese workers how to do the jobs they have dedicated their lives to.</p> <p>\"It's not easy to get up in the morning, training them to do your job so that you can be made unemployed,\" said Borman, pictured, a mother of three who has worked for 23 years at the Sensata auto sensors plant.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394528205\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/8/10/1344608047322/Bonnie-Borman-at-Sensata--004.jpg\" alt=\"Bonnie Borman at Sensata in Freeport\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bonnie Borman at Sensata in Freeport. Photograph: Carlos Ortiz/Polaris</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlos Ortiz/Polaris</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Borman knows her eventual fate in the stricken economy that surrounds Freeport. \"I am going to be competing for minimum wage jobs with my own daughter,\" she said.</p> <p>Such scenes have been common in America as manufacturing has fled abroad in search of cheaper wages.</p> <p>But, in the midst of the 2012 presidential election, Freeport is different. For Sensata is majority-owned by Bain Capital, the private equity firm once led by Mitt Romney, that has become a hugely controversial symbol of how the modern globalised American economy works. Indeed, Romney still owns millions of dollars of shares in the Bain funds that own Sensata.</p> <p>So as Sensata strips out costs by sacking American workers in favour of Chinese ones, the value of Romney's own investments could rise, putting money into the pockets of a Republican challenger who has placed job creation in America at the heart of his bid for the White House.</p> <p>The story of how Bain became involved in a car factory in a small town amid the rolling farmland of northern Illinois is emblematic of modern financial wheeling and dealing.</p> <p>Bain bought the firm that was to become Sensata in 2006, when it was the Texan arm of a Dutch company. It then floated it on the stock exchange in 2010, but kept a majority stake. Sensata came to own the Freeport plant at the beginning of 2011 as part of a wider purchase of a car parts business from Honeywell.</p> <p>Sensata spokesman Jacob Sayer said closing the Freeport plant to cut costs was a key element of the Honeywell deal. \"If that had not been part of the strategy, then the deal would not have been so attractive,\" he said.</p> <p>Bain has declined to comment. But it has made a lot of money from owning Sensata, quadrupling its initial 2006 investment. In business circles that focus on the bottom line is all that matters. But, not surprisingly, it cuts less ice in Illinois.</p> <p>Workers insist their operation is profitable and makes top quality auto sensors.</p> <p>\"I understand business needs to make a profit. But this product has always made a ton of money. It's just that they think it is not enough money. They are greedy,\" said Tom Gaulraupp, who has put in 33 years at the plant and is facing the prospect of becoming jobless at the age of 54.</p> <p>Mark Shreck, a 36-year-old father-of-three, confessed he was one of the few workers not surprised at the layoffs, as this is the second time his job has moved to China. \"I feel this is what companies do nowadays,\" he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-394528206\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2012/8/10/1344605889495/Freeport-mayor-George-Gau-004.jpg\" alt=\"Freeport mayor George Gaulrapp\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Freeport mayor George Gaulrapp. Photograph: Carlos Ortiz/Polaris</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carlos Ortiz/Polaris</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Freeport workers have appealed to Bain and Romney to save their plant. The local town council, several Illinois politicians and the state's Democratic governor have all rallied to their cause. \"This company is competitive globally. They make a profit here. But Bain Capital decided to squeeze it a little further. That is not what capitalism is meant to be about,\" said Freeport mayor George Gaulrapp, 52, pictured.</p> <p>The anger towards Bain and Romney is palpable. Romney has become the target for the emotions of a community who built lives based on the idea of a steady manufacturing job: a concept out of place in the sort of fluid buy-and-sell world from which Bain prospers. \"I didn't have a clue what Bain was before this happened,\" said Cheryl Randecker, 52. \"Now when I hear Romney speak it makes me sick to my stomach.\"</p> <p>President Barack Obama's campaign has sought to make Bain's record of buying and selling companies \u2013 often involving job losses \u2013 a key part of its strategy of painting Romney as an out-of-touch super-rich financier. In turn, Romney, who left Bain in 1999, has defended his long career there, saying Bain ends up generating economic growth and spurring job creation. Far from profiting from layoffs, Romney has portrayed Bain as a model for the American future.</p> <p>That argument stuns Illinois governor Pat Quinn. \"If he thinks that is the model for American economic growth then he is barking up the wrong tree,\" Quinn told The Guardian.</p> <p>Of course, no one at the Romney campaign wants to be linked with the Freeport plant closure. \"Governor Romney is not familiar with this issue and has not been involved in the management of Bain since 1999,\" said campaign spokeswoman Amanda Henneberg.</p> <p>Nor does anyone at Sensata want to discuss the social costs of their decision. \"We don't have any statement on the impact it has on Freeport,\" said Sayer. Bain did not return a request for comment.</p> <p>But the impact is enormous on individuals and city alike. Freeport, a city of 26,000, is struggling. Its downtown features empty store fronts and businesses barely getting by.</p> <p>The loss of 170 solid well-paying jobs will ripple out into this economy, further straining city resources, hurting businesses and eventually adding to Freeport's foreclosure problem. \"There is a sense of fright. People don't know what this means for their families, their health insurance and whether they will keep their homes,\" said mayor Gaulrapp.</p> <p>It is already happening.</p> <p>Tom Gaulrapp \u2013 no relation to the mayor \u2013 worries he will be homeless. \"It is a real possibility,\" he said. Randecker's daughter has already quit nursing college in Iowa to save money. Joanne Penniston, 35, is wondering if she will have to leave town. \"I would have to uproot my whole family,\" she said.</p> <p>Dot Turner, who joined the firm when she was 18 and freshly married and then put in 43 years on the factory floor, has suddenly found long cherished retirement plans thrown into disarray. She is 62 and knows finding another job will be tough. \"I should not be standing in an unemployment line at this stage of my life,\" she said.</p> <p>Turner too finds it hard to hear Romney talk of creating jobs when the post she has worked at for four decades \u2013 and which paid for three children to go to college \u2013 has just been sent overseas by a firm majority-controlled by Bain. \"When Romney talks about creating jobs, it is just a big fairy tale,\" she said.</p> <p>There is little chance of a happy ending for Freeport. The workers collect petitions and hold demonstrations. But they know they are likely doomed. \"We are not stupid. We know we are unlikely to save our jobs. But if we get the next company that tries it to think twice, then maybe we save our neighbour's job. Or our children's,\" said Tom Gaulrapp.</p> <p>Meanwhile, bit by bit, the machines inside the Freeport plant are being packed up, beginning their long journey to China. By the end of the year it will be over. \"It is kind of like part of your family being shipped out - I worked with that stuff for years. Now there's nothing left but a discoloration on the floor where the equipment used to sit,\" Gaulrapp said.</p>",
  "<p>In a recent <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/harry-belafonte-locarno-mitt-romney-359192\" title=\"\">interview with the Hollywood Reporter</a>, the legendary entertainer and long-time political activist Harry Belafonte spoke frankly and courageously about the current state of injustice and inequality in the world. His comments included a lament that has sparked some debate:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"I think that one of the great abuses of this modern time is that we should have had such high-profile artists, powerful celebrities. But they have turned their back on social responsibility. That goes for Jay-Z and Beyonc\u00e9 for example. Give me Bruce Springsteen and now you're talking. I really think he is black.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Is this a fair assessment of the current state of black celebrity? It is undeniable that today's top black artists and celebrities have the greatest leverage, power, visibility and global influence of any period. It is also true that few speak openly, regularly and publicly on behalf of social justice. Most remain remarkably quiet about the conditions that the majority of black people face.</p> <p>This is not to discount their philanthropic efforts. Often, celebrities take on non-controversial issues and or simply use their celebrity indirectly as a fundraising tool. But the kind of actions for which Belafonte, James Baldwin and others were known \u2013 marching with civil rights protesters under threat of death by citizen or police violence \u2013 is rare among modern superstars. Doing fundraisers is important, but unless it's a very controversial issue, that kind of giving is not terribly sacrificial; it's a feel-good decision for some and for others it's a cost of doing business. The current state of affairs calls for more visible courage than this.</p> <p>Black unemployment has recently been at what some call depression-era levels of around 18%. The drop-out rates for young black people are staggering and have lifelong effects. Although black people make up around 12% of the population, they make up over 40% of those incarcerated in prisons. Poverty levels have risen across the board, but in the black community it is catastrophic: 40% of black children are born into poverty today, a number that rivals the poverty rate of the pre-civil rights victories of the 1960s.</p> <p>How can so many high-profile artists have so little to say about all this?</p> <p>Belafonte's lament illuminates a fundamental shift in black popular culture. As black artists have gone mainstream, their traditional role has shifted. No longer the presumed cultural voice of the black collective social justice, it is now heavily embedded in mass cultural products controlled by the biggest conglomerates in the world.</p> <p>Even relatively tepid statements have to be managed and walked back. In the aftermath of Katrina, Kanye West said on national television during a fundraising telathon that <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pVTrnxCZaQ\" title=\"\">George W Bush didn't care about black people</a>. Any close examination of the government's post-Katrina response to black New Orleans or the impact of Bush policies and alliances on black America generally would give credence to this view. But West was challenged to and then compelled <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/nov/11/kanye-west-apologises-george-bush\" title=\"\">to apologise</a>. Why, and to what end?</p> <p>Some blame the artists for being sell-outs, while others blame the corporations for leaving artists little choice but to ply their trade in this terrain and keep quiet. It's the price of the ticket to be successful at the highest levels. So, perhaps in exchange for not talking openly about the danger of what Belafonte called \"unbridled capitalism\", highly rewarded artists are given prime access to corporate-controlled culture markets. Either way, the balance of power has shifted toward artistic success being determined by market success. And, many artists and fans have internalised the frightening collapse of the two.</p> <p>There are important exceptions to this trend. Rapper <a href=\"http://newsone.com/2027865/lupe-fiasco-barack-obama/\" title=\"\">Lupe Fiasco calling Obama a baby killer and terrorist</a> for ordering drone attacks that kill innocent people is a rare and risky one. It would be exhilarating to see the likes of Will Smith, Tyler Perry, Oprah Winfrey and others at that level of celebrity power marching against police <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/07/nypd-stop-frisk-justice-department1\" title=\"\">stop and frisk</a> policies and the high levels of incarceration of black youth in the prison industrial complex.</p> <p>In the history of black culture, popular music and art has played an extraordinary role in keeping the spirit alive under duress, challenging discrimination and writing the soundtrack to freedom movements. Visionary artists such as Harry Belafonte, Paul Robeson, <a href=\"http://womenshistory.about.com/od/aframerwriters/p/hansberry.htm\" title=\"\">Lorraine Hansberry</a> and Nina Simone were shaped by, and contributed to this tradition, not least because much of their celebrity derived from community support not challenged through corporate marketing strategy.</p> <p>The current expansion of the cultural arm of predatory capitalism threatens the power and vitality of this tradition by limiting visible spaces, audience appetite and celebrity influence of those who speak truth to power and sing the songs of justice.</p>",

  "<p>In Washington, conventional wisdom is everything. It's the driver of perceptions, and often of self-fulfilling political prophecies. That's why you might notice a guarded confidence amongst the Obama campaign these past few weeks: generally speaking, most realistic experts predict a victory for the president in this November's election.</p> <p>This perception is reinforced by current polling, some of the most recent being published by Quinnipiac University, the New York Times and CBS News, <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/8334-250_162-57483964/quinnipiac-university-cbs-news-new-york-times-poll-8-1-12/\">giving President Obama an edge</a> over Romney in key states like Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida. Certainly, it will be a tight race, but by any realistic standard, the money is on Obama to pull out a victory, even narrowly.</p> <p>But it's exactly the likely closeness of the race that may turn Washington's conventional wisdom on its head on election day. That's because, until relatively recently, political experts and journalists have been oblivious to a widespread and pernicious phenomenon occurring in many critical swing states \u2013 one that, unless checked, could erase Obama's electoral edge.</p> <p>This phenomenon takes the form of a <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/blogs/burns-haberman/2012/07/how-voter-id-laws-could-affect-the-outcome-in-november-130443.html\">spate of new voter laws</a>: efforts by Republican governors and Republican-controlled state legislatures to pass restrictive new voting rules just in time for election day. As a result, at least 5 million Americans <a href=\"http://www.brennancenter.org/content/resource/study_new_voting_restrictions_may_affect_more_than_five_million\">could essentially lose their right to vote</a>, according to the non-partisan Brennan Center in New York. </p> <p>It's no surprise that these laws are almost uniformly designed to disenfranchise young people and minorities \u2013 the very demographics that make up part of Obama's base. And 5 million votes flagrantly stolen from the Democrats, especially in the swing states where Obama currently has the edge, could easily spell a Romney victory.</p> <p>The Republican strategy here is simply too blatant to be believed, hence the relatively muted press coverage on the issue. Indeed, while Republican lawmakers have been busy undermining the basic rights of Americans for months now, it was not until recent weeks that <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/20/us/politics/tougher-voter-id-laws-set-off-court-battles.html?pagewanted=all\">the New York Times</a> and Washington Post started paying attention.</p> <p>As well they should, because it's no exaggeration to say that the results of these partisan tactics could make the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/36-Days-Complete-Chronicle-Presidential/dp/B000HWYV4W/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1344539931&amp;sr=1-4&amp;keywords=36+days\">Floridian recount of 2000</a> look like a minor political spat. We're looking at an election doomsday scenario that could eclipse any political scandal in American history.</p> <p>Hyperbole? Not when you examine the new laws more closely. The legislation being passed by Republicans across the country takes various forms, all designed to stop likely Obama voters casting ballots.</p> <p>The most common tactic is to heavily restrict the types of identification required at polling stations. In Pennsylvania, for example, that means requiring all voters to present <a href=\"http://www.philly.com/philly/news/20120809_Philly_city_commissioners_chief_denounces_voter_ID_law_with_data.html\">very limited types of ID</a> only available from the state's department of transportation. Since many inner-city voters don't drive, or many young voters have out-of-state driver's licenses, these likely Obama voters will all be stopped dead in their tracks before they reach the polling booth. The problem is so severe that the state of Pennsylvania itself has admitted that nearly 10% of voters do not have the required identification. In Philadelphia, an Obama stronghold, that figure is closer to 20%. <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/10/eric-holder-voter-id-poll-tax_n_1662847.html\">Attorney General Eric Holder summed it up</a> perfectly when he called these voter ID measures the equivalent of a \"poll tax\", at the NAACP summit in July.</p> <p>In Florida, where history proves that less than 1,000 votes can swing a national election, the efforts to stop minorities and the poor from voting are not just limited to new voter identification laws. In fact, voter registration drives have been banned, and early voting, thought to favor Democrats, has been significantly curtailed. Even more worrying is Governor Rick Scott's attempt simply to remove Obama voters from the election rolls. In May, Scott ordered a purge of his state's voter lists, based on drivers' license records, which he acknowledged to be deeply flawed.</p> <p>As a result, the state's division of elections initially found a mind-boggling 180,000 \"ineligible voters\" by performing a search of a computer database with inaccurate information. Yet, the purge goes on: the Miami Herald found that 58% of the people in a sample of 2,700 \"ineligible\" voters were Hispanic, and 14% were black. Whites and Republicans were least likely to be barred from voting. Even a second world war veteran was told he was not a citizen and <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/06/01/1096521/-Florida-tells-another-91-year-old-WWII-veteran-he-s-not-a-nbsp-citizen\">so to stay away from the voting booth</a>.</p> <p>Of course, Republicans justify their efforts to suppress the vote by arguing that they're simply preventing illegal voting. That sounds entirely fair \u2013 until you consider that the proven occurrence of voter fraud is almost non-existent. In fact, not a single person has ever been prosecuted for voting illegally. Yet, the public seems ambivalent about voter ID laws, which is why similar dirty tricks continue, taking various forms in other competitive states such as Virginia, New Hampshire, Ohio, Wisconsin and North Carolina.</p> <p>Luckily, progressive groups and the federal government are pushing back. <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/07/25/us-usa-voterid-pennsylvania-idUSBRE86O1L120120725\">In Pennsylvania</a>, groups like the <a href=\"http://www.advancementproject.org/\">Advancement Project</a> and the ACLU have filed suit on behalf of 38 plaintiffs, challenging the constitutionality of the new laws in state courts. The Advancement Project is also intervening in Wisconsin, fighting the fact that 78% of young African-American men lack the appropriate ID to vote, for example. The <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/justice-department-probes-pennsylvania-voter-id-law-225602771.html\">US department of justice is also intervening</a> in Pennsylvania and other states, questioning whether new laws disproportionately discriminate against minorities. And the Obama campaign is acutely aware of the danger, with dozens of staffers in the campaign headquarters and out in the field monitoring daily developments in every critical state.</p> <p>These counter-efforts are critical, yet the fear among Democrats is that they may not be sufficient to stop the new laws taking effect before the election. That is a significant danger, not only to the legitimacy of the results of the presidential race, but for the very core of America's democratic process. And, of course, it highlights the need for uniform standards across the country that guarantee free and fair elections.</p> <p>That's a battle for a later date. For now, we can only hope that voters will get wise to the Republican tactics and make every effort to <a href=\"http://www.866ourvote.org/\">make their voices heard on 6 November</a>.</p>",
  "<p>A power-crazed leader known as \"Rocky\" does pelvic floor exercises with his personal trainer on the \u00c9lys\u00e9e lawn. He shadow boxes in front of a mirror in his presidential office and in one especially caustic passage, minutes before a public appearance, demands a sexual favour from a provincial mayor in return for subsidising a medieval history museum.</p> <p>This controversial, thinly veiled fable of political love and war in Nicolas Sarkozy's fiefdom in the rich western suburbs of Paris is the surprise bestseller of the summer in France after it cost its author her job, infuriated Sarkozy's son Jean, and stoked tensions in the already fractured rightwing UMP party.</p> <p>Le Monarque, Son Fils, Son Fief (The monarch, his son, his fief) by Marie-C\u00e9lie Guillaume has topped the French bestseller charts for seven weeks, surprising critics and embarrassing the French right. Its presence in summer suitcases has shown not just readers' continued appetite for the bizarre character plots that defined Sarkozy's presidency, but also that truth can sometimes be stranger than fiction.</p> <p>Guillaume was head of staff for Patrick Devedjian, a one-time Sarkozy ally and minister for economic recovery, when she decided to tell all in a barely disguised <em>roman \u00e0 clef </em>about the infighting in the Hauts-de-Seine, the richest department in France.</p> <p>Jean, the former president's young student son, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/oct/16/jean-sarkozy-la-defense-politics\" title=\"\">whose rise in local politics sparked allegations of nepotism</a>, appears as \"Le Dauphin\" \u2013 an heir apparent desperate for attention from his absent father.</p> <p>Sarkozy's easily recognisable political friends appear as self-interested, cigar-chomping, bling-obsessed and permatanned a shade of \"deep caramel orange\". But the worst is reserved for Rocky, the Sarkozy character, who is so excited by power that he demands a sex act from a female politician who has an appointment at his office, telling her: \"Look at the state I'm in, you can't leave me like this \u2026 \"</p> <p>The book sparked such outrage from the Sarkozy camp in the Hauts-de-Seine that Devedjian sacked Guillaume as his head of cabinet. Jean Sarkozy accused Devedjian of being behind the book himself and lashed out at Guillaume for what he called a \"vile and sordid tissue of lies\".</p> <p>She in turn argued that the writing had been an outlet after the horrors of political infighting in the Hauts-de-Seine. She wanted to show politics in its most \"crude and brutal form\". Asked about the Sarkozy sex scene, which his allies dismissed as unlikely, she said she'd wanted to give an idea of power and sex that was \"universal\".</p> <p>This mix of the political and the literary on the summer bestseller lists is a taste of what's to come in the annual French publishing drive at the end of August. The main event of the publishing season is the first novelist-penned account of the new Socialist president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande.</p> <p>After Sarkozy's 2007 invitation to the playwright Yasmina Reza to document his election campaign, Hollande followed suit this year and was trailed by a young, award-winning Parisian novelist, Laurent Binet, a favourite of his partner Valerie Trierweiler.</p> <p>Her book, Rien Ne Se Passe Comme Prevu, (Nothing Goes According to Plan) is due out later this month. Binet has already taken to Twitter to bat off claims that he was asked by publishers to add more spice to the manuscript and more passages on Trierweiler.</p> <p>Trierweiler's own book on the campaign \u2013 in which she wrote captions for photos by Hollande's official photographer \u2013 has sold only 1,000 copies since June, the weekly L'Express reported.</p> <p>The disgraced, pariah-figure Dominique Strauss-Kahn has also inspired a books boom.</p> <p>Les Strauss-Kahn, an investigation by Le Monde journalists into his political life and behaviour, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jun/07/dominique-strass-kahn-new-book\" title=\"\">is at number two in the non-fiction bestsellers</a>.</p> <p>In the autumn, the writer Stephane Zagdanski will publish a novel, Chaos Br\u00falant (Burning Chaos), depicting the alleged New York Sofitel attack through the eyes of people in a Manhattan psychiatric centre.</p>",
  "<p>Japan and South Korea were heading for a diplomatic showdown on Friday, after Lee Myung-bak became the first sitting South Korean president to visit <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/aug/18/japan-south-korea-disputed-islands\" title=\"\">a group of islands</a> at the centre of a decades-old territorial dispute.</p> <p>Lee, who will step down as president later this year, ignored calls from Japanese leaders to cancel the trip to one of the islands that make up the Takeshima chain, known as Dokdo among Koreans.</p> <p>After arriving by helicopter from the nearby island of Ulleungdo, Lee said that South Korea \"must continue to protect its territory\". He left the island later in the afternoon and was due to speak to reporters on his return to Seoul.</p> <p>Lee's visit drew an angry response from Japan, which insists the islands, which lie roughly equidistant between the two countries in the Japan Sea \u2013 or the East Sea according to Koreans \u2013 are an integral part of its territory. In Tokyo, the government's chief spokesman, Osamu Fujimura, described Lee's visit as \"extremely regrettable\". Later, the government said it was ordering its ambassador in Seoul, Masatoshi Muto, to return to Tokyo to discuss the dispute.</p> <p>Japan's foreign minister, Koichiro Gemba, said the visit would have a big impact on bilateral ties, but did not specify what, if any, countermeasures were being considered.</p> <p>Officials in Seoul said Lee's visit was not designed to provoke Japan, with which South Korea enjoys close tourism and economic ties, albeit against a backdrop of resentment over Japan's 1910-1945 colonial rule of the Korean peninsula. An unnamed official said the trip was intended only to highlight the island's importance as a natural reserve. \"There shouldn't be anything unusual in a national leader visiting a place that is our territory,\" the official told Reuters.</p> <p>A freshwater lagoon helps sustain about 80 species of plants, and dozens of birds and insects. The meeting of cold and warm water currents has led to a profusion of fish and other marine life. The islands sit amid rich fishing grounds and, according to some reports, near frozen natural gas deposits that could be worth billions of dollars.</p> <p>A coastguard garrison has been stationed on Takeshima since 1954, and their only known civilian residents are Kim Seong-do, an elderly fisherman, and his wife, Shin-yeol.</p> <p>Lee's visit comes soon after Japan renewed its claim over Takeshima in its annual defence paper, and days before South Korea marks the anniversary of its liberation from Japanese rule at the end of the second world war.</p> <p>Some interpreted the move as an attempt by Lee to appeal to nationalist sentiment in the south and improve the chances of his party's candidate, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/10/park-geun-hye-korean-president\" title=\"\">Park Geun-hye</a>, in December's presidential election. South Korea's constitution bans sitting presidents from seeking a second term.</p> <p>Lee's ruling New Frontier party said Lee had demonstrated South Korea's \"determination to protect our territory\". But the main opposition Democratic United party said Lee should have used his final months in office to resolve longstanding disagreements over Japan's sexual enslavement of Korean women before and during the war, and the use of school textbooks glorifying Japanese militarism.</p> <p>The visit has also raised the stakes at the Olympics, where Japan and South Korea are due to play for the bronze medal in the men's football tournament in Cardiff on Friday.</p> <p>The Takeshima islands, comprising two small islands and more than 90 rocks and reefs, were made part of Japan's Shimane prefecture in 1905. The countries' competing claims are mired in historical ambiguity, and complicated by several name changes and cartographical evidence from myriad Korean, Japanese and western sources stretching back centuries.</p> <p>In 2010, South Korea's media reported the discovery of a 1949 US military map that, according to the Chosun Ilbo newspaper, \"clearly states that Dokdo belongs to Korea\".</p>",
  "<p>Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, the Venezuelan president, is claiming a US citizen has been arrested and interrogated on suspicions he is a mercenary involved in a conspiracy against the government.</p> <p>Ch\u00e1vez, who faces an election on 7 October, suggested the man is part of a plot to destabilise the country if he is re-elected. </p> <p>Ch\u00e1vez said the Hispanic man was detained on 4 August while crossing into Venezuela from Colombia. The president said the man was carrying a US passport with entrance and exit stamps from countries including Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya as well as a notebook containing geographical co-ordinates.</p> <p>The man's identity was not released. Ch\u00e1vez did not say where he was being interrogated.</p> <p>An official from the US embassy in Caracas did not answer repeated telephone calls seeking comment on Ch\u00e1vez's announcement.</p> <p>\"He has all the appearance of a mercenary,\" Ch\u00e1vez said, speaking during a campaign rally in the coastal state of Vargas. \"We are interrogating him.\"</p> <p>The man tore up part of the notebook in his possession when he was detained, Ch\u00e1vez said.</p> <p>Ch\u00e1vez, who often makes sweeping and bellicose denouncements of his opponents, suggested \u2013 without offering evidence \u2013 that the American might have been recruited by government opponents to instigate violent protests if opposition presidential candidate Henrique Capriles loses the election. Ch\u00e1vez has repeatedly vowed to win re-election and continue trying to steer Venezuela toward socialism.</p> <p>The president has repeatedly claimed the opposition plans to accuse election officials of rigging the vote and refuse to accept the results if he is victorious, an allegation that Capriles and fellow opposition leaders deny.</p> <p>\"A group of the bourgeoisie is preparing to reject the people's triumph, that's very clear,\" Ch\u00e1vez told the crowd of cheering supporters.</p> <p>Anti-Ch\u00e1vez politicians also reject the president's allegations they are trying to stir up trouble by campaigning in areas that have been bastions of support for Ch\u00e1vez or conspiring with US officials to provoke upheaval if Capriles fails to defeat the incumbent who is trying to win a fresh six-year term.</p> <p>So far campaigning ahead of the presidential vote has mostly been peaceful, but observers say there is a danger that Venezuela's deep political polarisation and rising tensions between allies and adversaries of Ch\u00e1vez could boil over.</p>"
