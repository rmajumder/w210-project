  "<p>How sweetly reasonable are the terms in which war is waged on the poor. We're all in this together, says George Osborne, and with workers' wages lagging inflation, it is only fair that those who don't have to toil for a living should share in the squeeze. Pegged automatically to the cost of living, benefits zipped up by 5.2% last year. The two-year freeze the Treasury now <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-19629997\" title=\"\">whispers it wants</a> is thus presented as a commonsensical move to restore some balance. What's more, as this week's <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/17/public-spending-higher-taxes-survey\" title=\"\">British Social Attitudes report confirmed</a>, the public is concerned about the welfare state's costs.</p> <p>Framed this way, the argument for holding benefits down is not merely appealing to the Conservative party, but seductive to many Labour and Liberal Democrat politicians too. No matter that the BSA is out of date, and that very many cuts are still to come. There is a very real danger that the Lib Dems in particular \u2013 who fought one of their <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2011/nov/18/liberal-democrats-benefits-fuel-duty\" title=\"\">bravest battles</a> to protect benefits from inflation last year \u2013 will now decide to save their energies for more popular fights. It will take courage to do otherwise, but there are reasons of expediency as well as principle for again mustering some of that.</p> <p>Indexation is not an increase: all it does is stop the poor getting poorer, by preventing inflation from eating up benefits. The Treasury offers a freeze as a way for the workless to take their fair share of pain, and perhaps that would be persuasive if they were not already being punished more savagely than everyone else. Housing benefit caps, cancelled council tax rebates and shredded tax credits: these are only a few of the means by which this government <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/oct/21/ifs-spending-review-cuts-poor-hit-hardest\" title=\"\">has placed the heaviest burden on the shoulders least able to bear them</a>. All told, Mr Osborne's agenda \u2013 which has already rewritten the indexation rules once \u2013 has set in train an annual \u00a318bn in cuts, lopping away nearly a fifth of the support available to children and adults below pensionable age. As he returns to demand an additional \u00a310bn a year, the prospect is of snatching away a quarter or more of total income from the neediest families.</p> <p>Put that way, the proposition does not sound quite so balanced. The wider context reveals it as extreme. Over a generation, the main benefits have lagged behind wages \u2013 which, in more ordinary times, outpace inflation. The dole has thus steadily dwindled from 17% of average male earnings in 1979 to barely 10% today, and yet Mr Osborne now wants to cut it still more. This week's 44% rise <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/sep/17/homeless-families-bed-and-breakfast\" title=\"\">in the number of families in emergency B&amp;B accommodation</a> is an early warning of where this is heading. Warm waffle about social mobility will count for nought while children are being shunted into cramped spaces that deny children all stability, let alone somewhere to study.</p> <p>If this were a question of necessity that would be one thing, but the Osborne freeze incorporates choices which betray cold indifference to hardship. Pensioners consume half the welfare budget and many are not poor, and yet \u2013 because of the grey vote \u2013 the government has more or less exempted them from the first \u00a318bn in cuts. And, instead of freezing their money, it has written special rules to provide for more generous annual pension increases. <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/33acb8ca-00b3-11e2-9dfc-00144feabdc0.html#axzz26pBkU4tj\" title=\"\">Writing in the FT</a>, Mr Osborne's biographer attributed political statecraft to his subject \u2013 his calculation that, by rolling back the reach of public provision, he can use austerity to change \"the makeup of the electorate itself\" and entrench support for his cuts. It is close to the reasoning that <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-19631430\" title=\"\">Mitt Romney has just been caught airing on mic</a>, but writing off voters who rely on the state did the Republican pretender no good. The chancellor's logic may have been meticulously forged from focus-group findings, but it might just turn out to blow up in his face as well.</p> <p>After all, it was this supposed arch-strategist's brazen budget that did the coalition such damage. Uniquely among today's big political beasts, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/14/boris-johnson-most-respected-politician\" title=\"\">YouGov polling last week</a> found him to be less respected than Nick Clegg. Mr Clegg ought to reflect upon that, and then take a punt on the decency of the British people, by rejecting this nasty benefit freeze.</p>",

Those who are dependent on government, and those who think government's job is to redistribute \u2026 I'm not going to get them.\"</p> <p>He acknowledged that some people do not pay income tax \u2013 the figure is actually 46% \u2013 for good reason: \"There are a number of retirees, members of the military who aren't paying taxes and that's as it should be.</p> <p>\"I think people would like to be paying taxes. The problem is that so many people have fallen into poverty that they're not paying taxes, [and] they're relying on government.\"</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ukhFBJgrZxM?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ukhFBJgrZxM\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p></p> <p>The revelations, which have forced the Romney campaign on to the defensive for the second week in succession, were met with dismay from conservative commentators and strategists, with one influential editor describing Romney's views as \"stupid\".</p> <p>His campaign team, with their candidate already trailing Barack Obama after a long list of self-inflicted gaffes over the summer, is anxiously awaiting the next batch of polls to see the extent of the fallout.</p> <p>The video was shot during an hour-long appearance by Romney in May at a $50,000-a-head fund-raising dinner at the Florida home of investment banker Marc Leder. More excerpts are being lined up for release, making it impossible for his campaign to dampen the firestorm and return to its core focus, the economy.</p> <p>The latest clip shows Romney dismissing the chances of peace in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, not an unusual view, but he then goes on to firmly put the blame solely on the Palestinians.</p> <p>He contentiously described the the Palestinians as \"committed to the destruction and elimination\" of Israel and indicated he was unlikely to pursue, as president, the creation of a Palestinian state, warning that Iran would use it as a base for attacks on Israel.</p> <p>The Israeli-Palestinian excerpt can be easily brushed aside by the Romney campaign but the 47% excerpt which was released on Monday is harder to handle.</p> <p>Within the space of a few minutes, Romney managed to potentially offend the elderly, veterans, students, Latinos and other demographic groups, most of whom do, in fact, pay some taxes and have earned their entitlements. </p> <p>In a remark that sounded especially callous from someone who claims that as president he would represent all Americans, he said: \"My job is not to worry about those people.\"</p> <p>One of the most destructive aspects of the video is the contrast between what he says in public and in private, opening him up to accusations of hypocrisy.</p> <p>The release of the video came only hours after the Romney team, struggling in the polls and repeatedly forced on the defensive by the Obama campaign team, had announced it was rebooting its campaign. </p> <p>The new-look strategy, in which Romney was to set out specific policies rather than focusing on attacking Obama, barely lasted 12 hours before the video emerged and the Romney campaign team was again engaged in damage-control.</p> <p>The media coverage was almost entirely negative. The New York Daily News on its front page had the headline \"Mitt Hits The Fan\".</p> <p>The Obama campaign was quick to jump on Romney's 47% remarks, with White House press secretary Jay Carney telling reporters on Tuesday that Obama was the president of all the people, not just those who voted for him. That was followed up with <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUQ-j2sOA7c&amp;feature=player_embedded\">a new Obama campaign video</a> in which footage from the 47% video was intercut with members of the public responding to it. \"I actually felt sick to my stomach,\" said one woman. </p> <p>But it is the reaction of conservatives that will cause the Romney campaign the most concern. Some are labelling his election run as the most inept they have seen in half a century.</p> <p>The influential editor of the conservative Weekly Standard William Kristol described Romney's comments about the 47% as \"arrogant and stupid\" and hinted he should stand down in favour of his a ticket headed by his running mate Paul Ryan, with senator Marco Rubio as his vice-presidential candidate.</p> <p>Mark McKinnon, who was one of John McCain's campaign advisers in the 2008 campaign and one of the few Republican strategists to go on the record yesterday, told the Hill magazine: \"It's a kidney shot because it reveals a very cynical view. He's pushing independent voters out the door.\"</p> <p>He added that it could help motivate disgruntled Democrats into turning out in large numbers for the election.</p> <p>With seven weeks left, there is still time for Romney to turn it around, with the support of tens of millions of dollars in advertising and a good performance in the debates with Obama, the first scheduled for 3 October in Denver, Colorado.</p> <p>Romney, who was scheduled to hold fundraising events in Salt Lake City and Dallas on Tuesday, looked uncharacteristically haggard when he held an impromptu press conference on Monday night to deal with the 47% video and offered up a rambling defence. He said he had been speaking \"off the cuff\" and describing his comments as not \"elegantly stated\".</p> <p>While Romney's views expressed in the new excerpt about the Palestinians are not a major surprise given his strong expression of support for the Israeli prime minister Binyanmin Netanyahu, US presidents like to portray themselves as neutral referees in the conflict, even if in fact they lean towards Israel. Romney has blown any lingering prospect of being seen as a neutral arbiter.</p> <p>\"I look at the Palestinians not wanting to see peace anyway, for political purposes, committed to the destruction and elimination of Israel,\" he said. He suggested he would not actively engage in the promotion of a peace process, as his predecessors have done. </p> <p>One of the reasons he said that it is difficult to allow the creation of a Palestinian state on the West Bank is that it could then become a base to which Iran and other Arab nations channel rockets and other weapons to threaten the Israeli financial capital Tel Aviv.</p> <p>Indicating he would not be pushing for a two-state solution, the creation of Palestine to stand alongside Israel, he said: \"All right, we have a potentially volatile situation but we sort of live with it, and we kick the ball down the field and hope that ultimately, somehow, something will happen and resolve it.\"</p> <p>The Obama administration, apart from a few tentative attempts at the start of his presidency, has made no serious effort to resolve the conflict. The Obama administration has hinted that, free from the constraints of fighting another election, it might take a more robust approach to the issue in a second term.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 20 September 2012. The original said \"He [Mitt Romney] described Tel Aviv as being only seven miles from the West Bank, though in fact it is over 40 miles away.\" In fact Tel Aviv is about 11 miles away from the nearest point of the West Bank.</p>",
  "<p>While the 47% of Americans who don't pay federal income tax got most of the flak in Mitt Romney's remarks to a wealthy clique of his supporters \u2013 now captured for posterity thanks to a hidden video camera \u2013 let's not overlook the remaining 53%, many of whom also received flesh wounds and collateral damage from Romney's gaffe-operated machine-gun.</p> <p>Once the initial shock from Romney's comments passes, Latinos, women and Jewish voters will join senior citizens, members of the US military, compassionate conservatives and the less well-off as among those wounded by the Republican presidential candidate's potshots. At least Dick Cheney only ever hit one person while out hunting. Romney, while on the chase for donations, managed to wing much of the US electorate, in one way or another.</p> <p>Here's a gaffe-by-gaffe guide to Romney's self-immolation.</p> <h2>The 47%-plus</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There are 47% who are \u2026 dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims \u2026 These are people who pay no income tax \u2026 So my job is is not to worry about those people. I'll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.</p> </blockquote> <p>The media's fact-checking machines have roared into life and churned out the many obvious flaws in Romney's statement: that the 47% he alludes to includes senior citizens depending on social security and Medicare, the working poor, members of the US military, and the out-of-work, as well as those who do pay taxes in the form of federal payroll taxes, state and municipal taxes, not to mention the national and local sales taxes that are impossible for most individuals to evade.</p> <p>Perhaps the oddest part of Romney's formulation is that these people somehow form an inevitable voting bloc for Obama. In the case of older retired voters \u2013 who don't pay income tax on social security and receive generous healthcare benefits from the state \u2013 that seems unlikely, given that national polls have the over-65s as one of Mitt Romney's strongest bases of support.</p> <p>What of the other parts of the 47% could Mitt Romney have cut off to spite his face-time with fundraisers?</p> <p>\u2022 Those unemployed or in difficulties in the course of this devastating recession, who Romney has been trying to woo with his promises of jobs, find themselves labelled as spineless.</p> <p>\u2022 Students, both because they typically don't pay federal income tax on account of low earnings and because many of them are also recipients of low-cost government grants or loans.</p> <p>\u2022 The working poor, such as a family of four earning a household total of $40,000. They may not have to pay federal income tax, thanks to earned income tax credits, but they can hardly be accused of either believing they are victims or of not taking responsibility for their lives.</p> <p>\u2022 Members of the US military serving in war zones, who are not required to pay federal income tax on their pay and benefits, and are directly employed by the US government, may not be happy at the thought they have a victim mentality.</p> <h2>Israel and Jewish voters</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We have a potentially volatile situation but we sort of live with it, and we kick the ball down the field and hope that ultimately, somehow, something will happen and resolve it. We don't go to war to try and resolve it imminently.</p> </blockquote> <p>Another group of voters that Mitt Romney has had trouble reaching \u2013 in spite of repeated attempts \u2013 is Jewish voters. Poll after poll shows Obama with a wide margin in support, as Democrats have traditionally enjoyed. <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/USPresidentialrace/Article.aspx?id=285336\">But a recent Gallup poll published by Buzzfeed Politics</a> put it at 70% for Obama and just 25% for Romney.</p> <p>The relationship of American Jews to Israel is a complex and multi-faceted one, but it's hard to imagine many shades of Jewish opinion finding something to celebrate in Romney's remarks on the Israel-Palestine issue: in essence, shrugging it off. </p> <p>The hawks \u2013 who would approve of Romney sabre-rattling remarks regarding Iran \u2013 would prefer more full-throated support from a American presidential candidate. But the majority, especially those who favour a two-state solution, would be unhappy with Romney's remarks that \"the pathway to peace is almost unthinkable to accomplish,\" having rattled off a weak series of objections, and appearing to think that the West Bank borders on Syria.</p> <p>The idea that a US president would merely punt on the most difficult issue in modern geopolitics \u2013 which is what kicking the ball down the field means \u2013 is among the most extraordinary remarks to come out of these tapes.</p> <h2>Women voters</h2> <p>Romney's failure to win more support from women voters is the over-riding reason for his failure to overtake Barack Obama in the opinion polls since becoming the GOP nominee. The Florida tapes suggest why: when prompted by a discussion with the wealthy donors, Romney offers only his wife Ann as evidence of his appeal to women voters.</p> <p>And even then, Romney makes what sound like cynical remarks about his wife's role in the political process: \"We use her sparingly now, in case people get tired or attack,\" he says, although he assures the room that she will be on the campaign trail frequently.</p> <p>Mitt's other meta-analysis again suggests a cold sense of calculation when speaking about his wife: \"We had a person named Hillary Rosen who attacked her and that made Ann more visible to the American people, which I think was helpful and gave her a platform she wouldn't have had otherwise.\" How gallant.</p> <p>The only other issue that women voters might be interested in, it would appear from this tape, is The View, the ABC daytime talkshow. Although Romney counsels The View, aside from one conservative \u2013 Elizabeth Hasselbeck \u2013 the other hosts are described as \"women who are sharp-tongued\".</p> <h2>Latino voters</h2> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Had [my father] been born of Mexican parents, I'd have a better shot of winning this. But he was unfortunately born to Americans living in Mexico. He lived there for a number of years. I mean, I say that jokingly, but it would be helpful to be Latino.</p> </blockquote> <p>A joke it may have been but Romney's remarks can't have helped him gain ground with yet another group he is struggling to win over: Latinos. \"The insult of all insults, Mitt Romney says if he was Latino he would win the presidential election, as if being Latino would have given him any advantage to win the White House,\" was one of many sharp responses, that one coming from Democratic congressman Xavier Becerra.</p> <p>Romney's joke came on the same day his campaign was boasting of a new and high-profile attempt to target Hispanic votes, including an appearance before the US Hispanic chamber of commerce. </p> <p>As with his remarks about women voters, Romney's comments suggest that identity rather than policies are what win elections, which may explain his personal shape-shifting. What he fails to understand is that his policies, especially on immigration and his risible \"self-deportation\" idea, are what is holding him back with Latinos, rather than his ethnic identity.</p> <h2>Compassionate conservatives</h2> <p>Compassionate conservatives do exist and many of them have been up in arms about the thrust of Romney's 47% remark \u2013 an \"imperious canard\", <a href=\"http://www.theamericanconservative.com/the-53-percent-are-at-the-trough-too/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=the-53-percent-are-at-the-trough-too\">as the American Conservative described it</a>.</p> <p>These are otherwise reliable Republican voters, including some Christians and evangelicals, who may find themselves less likely to support or even vote for a GOP presidential ticket headed by Romney.</p> <p>What defence there has been of Romney's remarks has claimed, without evidence, that those in the 47% don't necessarily define themselves as such. That has to be true to a point \u2013 who wants to agree that they are pathetic victims? \u2013 but here Mitt Romney has done the job for them: he has told them that they are victims, that they are feckless, and furthermore that he does not care for them. Romney has, in short, labelled them with a badge of shame.</p> <p>Rusty Reno, editor of First Things \u2013 the conservative religious journal founded by Richard John Neuhaus \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.firstthings.com/blogs/firstthoughts/2012/09/18/absurd-republican-rhetoric/\">dismantled Romney's \"absurd\" remarks with a quiet ferocity</a>. Sketching out the life of a family of a man earning $12 an hour in Omaha, Nebraska, Reno numbered the entitlements a family of modest means required \"for their survival, to say nothing of any opportunity to advance\".</p> <p>The modern welfare and entitlement state is a mess, he concluded: \"But it's historically, intellectually, and morally stultifying to imagine that this mess is somehow unnecessary, that it is the result of the laziness or irresponsibility of working people and the wicked plots of collectivist liberals.\"</p> <p>Writing in the American Conservative, Rod Dreher commented on Reno's criticism: \"I thought I was the only theocon Romney had lost, or just about lost, with his 47% talk. Guess not.\" <a href=\"http://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/romney-conservatism-of-the-heartless/\">Dreher described Romney's remarks as \"conservatism of the heartless,\"</a> and that they may have revived economics \"as a pressing moral concern for religious conservatives\".</p>",
  "<p>Russia has ordered a key US agency to shut down operations as Vladimir Putin continues to crackdown on a protest movement that he maintains was orchestrated by the US state department.</p> <p>The government has given the US agency for international development (USAid) until 1 October to shut its office in Moscow. \"While USAid's physical presence in Russia will come to an end, we remain committed to supporting democracy, human rights, and the development of a more robust civil society in Russia,\" state department spokesperson Victoria Nuland said in a statement.</p> <p>The move appeared to be the latest salvo in the Kremlin's efforts to squeeze a protest movement largely borne of civil society efforts to highlight growing government abuses. In addition to funding health and environment projects, USAid mainly focuses on supporting groups that promote democracy and human rights in Russia.</p> <p>\"We regret this decision by the Russian government,\" a senior Obama administration official said. \"We lament the fact that we will not be able to do the work that we've been proud to do. It's a difficult day.\"</p> <p>Putin, who returned to the presidency in May amid an unprecedented protest movement against him, has reserved particular scorn for Golos, an election monitoring organisation that receives the bulk of its budget from USAid. The group highlighted voting violations during a contested parliamentary election in December, helping bring tens of thousands into the streets as reports and videos of fraud went viral on YouTube and social networks.</p> <p>The administration official remained defiant about US funding of civil society in Russia, saying the order to close the agency \"doesn't mean we've changed our policy of supporting the kinds of actors USAid has supported\".</p> <p>\"Over the coming weeks and months, the Obama administration will look at ways to advance our old policy objectives with new means,\" the official said.</p> <p>The situation could become reminiscent of the drawn out struggle experienced by the British Council, which was forced to shut all its offices outside Moscow in 2007 as relations plunged in the wake of the murder in London of dissident Alexander Litvinenko.</p> <p>About 60% of USAid's $50m budget for 2012 went to groups that promote democracy and human rights \u2013 a sharp increase from the Bush era. The agency first opened in Moscow in the wake of the Soviet Union's collapse.</p> <p>Among the nearly 57 organisations that receive USAid funding in Russia are human rights NGO Memorial and anti-corruption group Transparency International.</p> <p>Those groups have already been squeezed. The Russian parliament passed a new law this summer that required all non-governmental organisations that receive foreign funding to brand themselves \"foreign agents\" on all publications and websites and to undergo extra financial checks.</p> <p>Although rumours that the Kremlin was pressuring USAid had long swirled, the government's means of informing Washington appeared sudden. Sergei Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, first informed Hillary Clinton, the US secretary of state, of the planned move during a meeting at an economic summit in Vladivostok earlier this month. The foreign ministry sent official notice on 12 September.</p> <p>USAid's 13 diplomats will likely have to leave the country. The fate of the 60 locals that work for the office remains unclear.</p> <p>Officials in Washington see the Russian move as part of the continuing war of attrition by Moscow against groups clamouring for greater democracy. They say it has been clear for some time that the Russian government has been irritated by USAid's support for an array of pro-democracy organisations, civic society groups and human rights activists.</p> <p>Putin has drawn on Cold War stereotypes and conspiracy theories on US involvement in the Arab Spring uprisings to blame the US for encouraging Russia's own opposition movement. Relations have plunged to further lows over Moscow's defiant stance against pressuring the regime of Syrian president Bashar al-Assad.</p>",

  "<p>Many mainstream Republican commentators have cringed at Mitt Romney's secretly video-taped comments in which he suggested 47% of Americans are government-dependent \"victims\" \u2013 but a powerful group of conservative agitators have welcomed the remarks.</p> <p>They have fervently embraced Romney's private attack on those who receive benefits from the state as a chance to put forward a more hardline anti-government philosophy, and urged Romney not to back away from his comments.</p> <p>Chief among those backing Romney is conservative talk radio host Rush Limbaugh, whose show attracts millions of conservative listeners across America and has brought him immense political influence.</p> <p>\"This is such a golden opportunity,\" <a href=\"http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/\">Limbaugh said during his afternoon radio show</a>. \"This could be the opportunity for Romney and for that campaign to finally take the gloves off and take the fear off and just start explaining conservatism. Start explaining liberty to people and what it means, and explain that they don't have to be in that 47%.\"</p> <p>Limbaugh went on to say that he often attended big Republican fundraisers, like the one in Florida at which Romney was recorded, and that many politicians were often more bluntly conservative in private than in public.</p> <p>\"They are as conservative as you and I are. I've spoken to them privately. The candidates I see on the campaign trail versus the ones that tell me what they really think are two different people. He [Romney] was basically telling these people that we have reached a crossroads in this country. You and I talk about it all the time,\" Limbaugh said.</p> <p>Conservative blogger Erick Erickson, founder of the influential Republican website Red State, said Romney should take the remarks and press forward with them.</p> <p>\"Team Romney should force this debate onto the national stage. They should not walk it back. The American people are with him,\" <a href=\"http://www.redstate.com/2012/09/18/conservatives-agree-romneys-right/\">Erickson wrote in a blogpost</a> addressing the fallout from the political controversy.</p> <p>\"Romney's point about government dependency ties perfectly to the dreadful economic news of late,\" he wrote.</p> <p>Others agreed. Michael Walsh, writing for the National Review, said this was a big political opportunity for Romney. \"Romney sounded remarkably like \u2026 a real conservative. He ought to own it,\" he said in a piece that labelled the crisis <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/322409/mitts-gettysburg-moment-michael-walsh#\">'Mitt's Gettysburg moment'</a> after the famous civil war battle of 1863.</p> <p>Romney's team has so far appeared to have heeded the advice of the conservative base over more establishment conservatives, some of whom \u2013 like the New York Times' David Brooks and the Weekly Standard's Bill Kristol \u2013 have been withering in their criticism of Romney.</p> <p>While accepting that his language was not \"elegantly stated\", Romney has not backtracked from his comments. Indeed, some of his conservative supporters have have now attacked those criticising Romney.</p> <p>Walsh singled out Brooks' as deploying \"faulty logic\" and that his column read as if \"wicked Republicans want to rend the safety net and turn it into tying rope for their yachts\".</p> <p>Limbaugh summed up much of the conservative reaction to the spat with the final words on his segment about the issue.</p> <p>\"Romney has to get out there, take this by the horns, turn it into a positive, and go right for those people since they're now listening. Especially if they think they've been insulted \u2013 even better! This is the time to go talk to them,\" he said.</p>",
  "<p>The Maldives stand on a knife edge. At stake is its <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-12651486\" title=\"\">hard-won liberal democracy</a>, forged from the ruins of a brutal, 30-year dictatorship \u2013 a period that was synonymous with serious human rights abuses, including extrajudicial killings and torture.</p> <p><a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/7658672.stm\" title=\"\">President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom</a>'s rule was eventually ended in 2008, by a democratic vote in which I was elected. But it is important that the outside world clearly understands that Gayoom, his allies and his henchmen are back. It was they who established, late last year, the \"December coalition\" of Islamic extremists who accused my government of being controlled by \"Jews\" and \"Christians\" and used incitement to religious hatred and violence as political tools. It was they who orchestrated February's overthrow of the Maldives' first democratically elected government. And it is they who control the current administration as well as the police and armed forces. From this position of strength, they are slowly squeezing the life out of the democratic fabric of my country.</p> <p>Despite this, the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (Cmag), which met last week, is considering removing the Maldives situation from its agenda. A decision is expected in late Septemberlater this month. The choice before the group, comprising the foreign ministers of Australia, Bangladesh, Canada, Jamaica, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Trinidad &amp; Tobago and Vanuatu, could hardly be more important.</p> <p>Thousands of pro-democracy protesters in the Maldives have been brutalised by the police, arrested and imprisoned. Many of them have been tortured, or charged with terrorism \u2013 the favoured means, post 9/11, for repressive states to dispose of opponents. Journalists have been beaten and arrested and media outlets threatened with legal action and closure. Freedom of speech is being strictly curtailed \u2013 people can now be arrested for calling members of the current government \"traitors\". And the country's independent oversight bodies are being staffed with friends and relatives.</p> <p>Moreover, a growing sense of impunity is taking hold. Key agents of February's coup d'etat, and the police officers responsible for the violence that followed, know they cannot be touched. A grotesquely one-sided report into the coup, by the Commission of National Inquiry, was co-chaired by Gayoom's former defence minister. Despite gross and systematic human rights violations since February \u2013 all catalogued by NGOs such as <a href=\"http://www.amnesty.org/en/region/maldives\" title=\"\">Amnesty International</a> and the <a href=\"http://minivannews.com/politics/maldives-backtracking-on-democracy-international-federation-for-human-rights-43715\" title=\"\">International Federation of Human Rights</a> \u2013 not one police officer or state representative has been prosecuted. Indeed, many of those responsible have been promoted.</p> <p>The government has said it will not do anything to ensure accountability for these crimes. And yet, without even a hint of irony, it is ruthlessly pursuing legal action against many of the pro-democracy campaigners elected to government in 2008, including myself. Numerous members of parliament from my party, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maldivian_Democratic_Party\" title=\"\">Maldives Democratic party</a>, have been taken before pliant judges and stripped of their seats. Many more await trial. The government has also made clear that I and members of my former cabinet will stand trial very soon, with the home minister promising that I will be imprisoned for the rest of my life.</p> <p>Their goal, in addition to revenge for their electoral defeat, is to prevent me standing in next year's election. Gayoom and his allies made the mistake once of losing power through a free and fair election: they will not make the same mistake twice.</p> <p>If Cmag were to remove the Maldives from its agenda the chances of securing justice for the victims of human rights violations, and of ever again having free and fair elections in the country, would disappear. The Maldives would once again become a police state, and our cherished democracy relegated to a footnote in the history books \u2013 a one-off experiment that failed.</p> <p>So I urge the group members to keep the spotlight on my country until all violations have been dealt with, all victims have received redress, and conditions are in place for fresh elections.</p>",

But they also highlight a point of view that is gaining traction on both sides of the conflict: that the \"two-state solution\" is dead and that alternative scenarios must be considered and even embraced.</p> <p>According to Romney, the Palestinians are committed to the destruction and elimination of Israel and have no interest in peace; if they had a state, the Iranians in no time would be shipping arms into the West Bank for use against Israel; and the world had better learn to live with this unsolved problem.</p> <p>His characterisation of the Palestinians is wrong. The Palestinian Liberation Organisation, acknowledged as the \"sole legitimate representative\" of the Palestinian people, recognises the right of Israel \"to exist in peace and security\". The Palestinian leadership is committed to a negotiated solution and opposes armed struggle. Talks have been in abeyance for the past two years, but many diplomats and observers say Israel's continued settlement growth is the main obstacle rather than Palestinian intransigence.</p> <p>The official founding charter of Hamas, the Islamist faction that rules the tiny Gaza Strip, still calls for historic (ie pre-1948) Palestine to be liberated. However, its leaders have repeatedly indicated, albeit sometimes opaquely, that they can live with a Palestinian state within 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital.</p> <p>Romney's second point is that \"the other side of what would be this new Palestinian state would either be Syria at one point, or Jordan\", through which Iran could channel weapons. Wrong again. The West Bank has no border with Syria. There is a boundary between the Golan Heights, which is Syrian territory occupied by Israel since 1967, and Syria proper, but the West Bank's boundaries are with Jordan \u2013 not an ally of Iran \u2013 and Israel. Gaza's borders are with Israel and Egypt.</p> <p>Romney's third point cannot be simply dismissed. Looking to the future, he says: \"You hope for some degree of stability, but you recognise that this is going to remain an unsolved problem \u2026 We sort of live with it.\" This contradicts official US policy, which is that a two-state solution is still possible and desirable. But it reflects a growing debate on both sides of the conflict, which is that the entrenched and growing Jewish presence in the West Bank has rendered two separate states impossible.</p> <p>On the Palestinian side, some argue that one democratic state, in which everyone had equal rights, would soon lead to a Palestinian demographic majority and therefore political dominance. Of course, it would spell the end of the Jewish homeland, which is why Israel and most of the world cannot countenance it. On the Israeli side, some also argue for one state, but one in which Palestinians are denied full democratic rights, thus ensuring the Israeli hold on the biblical land of Judea and Samaria (aka the West Bank) and Jewish dominance. Critics say this would be a new form of apartheid.</p> <p>In the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/11/opinion/seven-lean-years-of-peacemaking.html\" title=\"\">New York Times last week</a>, the respected commentator and former Israeli negotiator Daniel Levy wrote: \"New dividing lines have emerged within Israel's ruling elites.\" There were, he said, \"three competing tendencies within Israel's ruling coalition: annexationists (who want to formally take over the West Bank), status quo merchants (who wink at the notion of two states while expanding settlements), and Bantustan two-staters (who want the Palestinians to accept 50% of the West Bank as constituting a state).\"</p> <p>Finally, there is Romney's jaw-dropping payoff. He relates being called by a former secretary of state who said there was indeed a prospect of settlement of an issue that would surely be near the top of any US president's in-tray. Romney's response? \"I didn't delve into it.\"</p>",
  "<p>If the Republican primaries and presidential campaign have taught us anything, it is that Mitt Romney is not very good at politics. Incessant gaffes, strategic missteps, a paucity of policy prescriptions and a plethora of head-scratching tactical decisions have come to define his run for the White House. Quite simply, Mitt Romney is a bad politician.</p> <p>But on Monday night, we learned something new \u2013 and profoundly unsettling \u2013 about him: he may very well also be a bad person.</p> <p>I don't use those words lightly, but I'm not sure how else to interpret the comments he made at a closed-door fundraiser that were <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/09/secret-video-romney-private-fundraiser\">posted online by Mother Jones</a>. They are devastating. They suggest a level of meanness and divisiveness in Romney's personal character that is disturbing \u2013 even disqualifying for the nation's highest office.</p> <p>Look at <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/09/secret-video-romney-private-fundraiser\">how Romney classifies the 47% of Americans</a> who don't pay federal income taxes:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"[They] will vote for the president no matter what. All right, there are 47% who are with him, who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to healthcare, to food, to housing, to you-name-it. That that's an entitlement. And the government should give it to them. And they will vote for this president no matter what \u2026 These are people who pay no income tax \u2026</p> <p>\"[M]y job is is not to worry about those people. I'll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>This is a breathtaking statement: a fundamental misunderstanding of the American social contract. Romney proposes here that the senior citizen living on a fixed income believes government has a responsibility to care for them \u2013 rather than that government has a responsibility to fulfil its obligation to them after they spent years paying into social security and Medicare. He is saying that workers laid-off from their jobs, who rely on food stamps to feed their children and unemployment insurance to pay their rent, believe government owes them food and shelter, rather than getting some support at a time of dire financial need which their payroll taxes had paid for when they were in work.</p> <p>Romney's message to these voters, these 47% of Americans, is not only \"I am not going to seek your vote\"; it's \"I don't respect you.\"</p> <p>Worse than the crudeness of Romney's argument is its remarkable lack of social empathy. The United States provides healthcare, food, housing and \"you-name-it\" to our fellow citizens not as a means of capturing their vote, but because this is fundamental to the basic social compact. That fact seems to elude Romney.</p> <p>So what does this mean for Romney's presidential prospects? Some conservatives <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/rosiegray/conservatives-embrace-romneys-47-remarks\">seem overjoyed by the revelations</a> \u2013 believing, it seems, that a \"makers v takers\" dividing line is a key to political success. Certainly, there is a cross-section of Americans who buy into Romney's Ayn Randian views. There is also plenty of evidence from the world of political science that gaffes might get everyone ginned up on Twitter, but <a href=\"http://themonkeycage.org/blog/2012/09/17/mitt-romney-and-that-47/\">they don't necessarily move voters</a>.</p> <p>This gaffe, though, has the potential to be different \u2013 because it insults so many individual Americans. Romney's Republican presidential forebears had the shrewd good sense to demonise easily stereotyped minorities: Richard Nixon took on the \"shouters\" and \"demonstrators\" in the 1960s, while Ronald Reagan attacked \"welfare queens\" in the 1980s. In his clumsy caricature, Romney has savaged just under half the electorate.</p> <p>But the damage, once again, is self-inflicted: Romney has succeeded in highlighting the very things voters already don't like about him: that he is not genuine, saying one thing in public and another behind closed doors; that he is so cosseted in wealth he does not understand and cannot relate to the challenges of ordinary Americans; that a callous streak runs through the private equity guy's empathy deficit \u2013 the outsourcer who \"likes firing people\". The fact that these remarks were given at a private fundraiser to a group of fat cats only endorses these negative perceptions.</p> <p>The biggest problem, though, may be the cumulative narrative: that it provides one more hit on Romney in a week in which he has done nothing right. First, there was his disastrous appearance on <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/09/mitt-romney-meet-the-press-david-gregory_n_1868546.html\">NBC's Meet the Press</a>, in which he flip-flopped on repealing Obamacare and bizarrely attacked his own vice-presidential candidate for supporting defense cuts last summer. Then came his crass intervention in the political debate that followed the violence in Libya and Egypt, in which he falsely accused the president \u2013 on 11 September, of all days \u2013 of sympathizing with anti-American protesters. And even when that line of attack was comprehensively discredited, Romney doubled down on it the next morning. Finally, there was <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0912/81280.html\">Sunday's night Politico report</a> chronicling the in-fighting and mismanagement threatening to cripple his campaign. </p> <p>It was a terrible week for Romney and the Republican party \u2013 one that suggested his campaign had acquired the hard-to-shake odor of loserdom. When that sense takes hold, every mistake, even minor ones, are magnified \u2013 feeding into the notion that the Romney team is the proverbial gang that can't shoot straight. We've seen this before, with George HW Bush in 1992; with Al Gore in 2000; with Sarah Palin in 2008. A meme of smelly failure develops around a candidate and every story is fitted to that emerging narrative. For Romney, the narrative now is that he is running, as <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/18/opinion/brooks-thurston-howell-romney.html?_r=1&amp;smid=tw-share\">David Brooks put it in the New York Times</a>, a \"depressingly inept presidential campaign\".</p> <p>It is hard to imagine how a presidential candidate could articulate such contempt towards virtually half the country that has not been as blessed with the advantages of being born into wealth and making more, as he has, and still hope to lead them. Whether or not Mitt Romney really is a bad person is perhaps irrelevant: he is clearly a bad politician \u2013 and this last week has made it highly unlikely that he will get the chance to be a bad president.</p>",

  "<p>Kenyan troops are about to advance on Somalia's rebel-held southern port of Kismayo in a final assault against the Islamist militants of al-Shabaab, according to a military spokesman in Nairobi.</p> <p>Kismayo's capture would mark a major breakthrough for the <a href=\"http://amisom-au.org/\" title=\"\">African Union forces</a> fighting the rebels, but rights groups are concerned a protracted battle could lead to many civilian deaths.</p> <p>A victory would probably reinforce the optimism that greeted <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/10/somalia-chooses-new-president-elections\" title=\"\">last week's election</a> as president of activist and professor Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, the first leader to be chosen in Somalia since the military dictator Mohamed Siad Barre was overthrown in 1991.</p> <p>Al-Shabaab, which has been forced to relinquish control of a number of cities and towns in Somalia this year, is heavily dependent on revenue from charcoal exports through Kismayo's port, and taxes levied on businesses.</p> <p>However, some analysts warn that defeat would not signal the end of the al-Qaida-linked group, which could melt into the countryside and continue attacking the African Union's Amisom troops and their Somali allies. It is also unclear who would then control Kismayo, a lucrative source of income that has been fought over by Somali clans in the past.</p> <p>Military spokesman Colonel Cyrus Oguna said Kenyan troops were stockpiling supplies of fuel and ammunition around the town of Jan Abdala, about 25 miles (40km) from Kismayo, before moving forward.</p> <p>\"The final advance to Kismayo may be in the next one or two days. I cannot tell you with any certainty when [the city] may fall,\" he said, adding it might take a week or two to secure victory.</p> <p>Al-Shabaab said on Tuesday on its Twitter page that \"rumours of Mujahideen withdrawing from Kismayo are blatant lies being peddled by the Kuffar [unbeliever] to further their agenda\".</p> <p>Oguna said al-Shabaab fighters and vehicles from Kismayo were reportedly moving into towns north-west of the city, including Jamaame and Jilib.</p> <p>\"I think they have sensed defeat and the amount of casualties they have incurred \u2026 has been so enormous,\" he said, adding that he believed the rebels were heading to strongholds further north.</p> <p>Kenyan troops crossed the border into Somalia in October last year to pursue the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/oct/17/somali-islamists-threaten-kenya-attack\" title=\"\">al-Shabaab</a> militants blamed by officials for a series of cross-border raids and kidnappings.</p> <p>The troops were integrated into the 17,000-strong African Union Amisom peacekeeping force in June, and are advancing with Somali troops and fighters from the Ras Kamboni militia in the south.</p> <p>Oguna said around 30 al-Shabaab fighters had been killed in the last few days. One Somali soldier also died and one or two Kenyan soldiers were injured, he added.</p> <p>The Kenyan navy has shelled Kismayo in recent weeks, with <a href=\"[http://www.hrw.org/news/2012/08/23/somalia-protect-civilians-kismayo]\" title=\"\">Human Rights Watch</a> saying two teenage boys and a pregnant woman were killed on 11 August.

  "<p>Mitt Romney's lumbering, stumbling presidential campaign looks a lot more fun when viewed through the prism of O Brother, Where Art Thou? \u2013 reputedly the candidate's <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/281471/candidates-favorite-flicks-tevi-troy\" title=\"\">all-time favourite film</a>.</p> <p>Simply hit the fast-forward button and add a bluegrass score, and hey presto \u2013 that dreary round of stage-managed photo ops and exhausted stump speeches is transformed into a freewheeling picaresque in which the eye-waggling billionaire bounds merrily through the swing states, up to his necktie in all manner of mischief. Tremble as Mighty Mitt finds himself seduced by a trio of sexy sirens. Marvel as he foils the Ku Klux Klan and tumbles ass-backwards into pop stardom as the lead singer of the Soggy Bottom Boys. Thrill, finally, to his new campaign slogan, lifted from George Clooney's movie catchphrase and perfectly capturing the mood of the Republican faithful this election year: <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Dg6DpEAscU\" title=\"\">\"Damn! We're in a tight spot!\"</a></p> <p>Now obviously, when a man like Mitt Romney owns up to his favourite anything (film, book, sexual position), the revelation tends to say more about the perceived taste of the electorate than it does about the candidate himself. In this case, the message is charmingly transparent. You thought Romney was a dull, cold-blooded technocrat? Perish the thought. There's nothing he likes better than the goof-ball antics of those wacky Coen dudes. (Incidentally, the US comic Rob Delaney has tweeted that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/sep/17/rob-delaney-twitter-standup-interview\" title=\"\">Romney says \"Ha ha ha! Terrific!\"</a> every time Jar Jar Binks appears on screen. It's not hard to imagine him delivering a similar verdict each time George Clooney starts fussing with his hairnet.)</p> <p>That aside, Romney deserves credit for at least naming a film and sticking by it. His opponent, by contrast, segments his vote between Casablanca, The Godfather, Lawrence of Arabia and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. Pound for pound, every one is a better movie than O Brother (a flurry of jubilant set-pieces as opposed to a joined-up story). And yet there's something curiously dispiriting about seeing Obama's favoured titles listed for the masses like a series of leather-bound classics displayed on a shelf. On balance I like Romney's choice better. It's the perfect comic template for the perfect comic candidate, a man bouncing through the new American Depression, blithely <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/18/romney-secret-video-government-dependent\" title=\"\">writing off 47% of the electorate</a> and seemingly pointed towards disaster. \"Ha ha ha! Terrific!\" barks Romney as his tight spot turns tighter still.</p>",
  "<p>What defines a woman? Over the past few weeks the defining feature has been the new celebrity in town, a source of fascination to <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-19319240\" title=\"\">deluded politicians</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/02/naomi-wolf-women-orgasm-neural-wiring\" title=\"\"><em>soi-disant</em> feminists</a> alike: the vagina, a magical creature that can distinguish between consensual sex and rape and, according to Naomi Wolf's now <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2012/09/10/120910crbo_books_levy\" title=\"\">much-</a><a href=\"http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2012/sep/27/pride-and-prejudice/?pagination=false book\" title=\"\">mocked</a> <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/laurie-penny/2012/09/problem-naomi-wolfs-vagina\" title=\"\">book</a>, can hear when it is being insulted and will rebel in kind, turning the carrier person into \"a bitch\". This is the problem with essentialism: no matter how varied its uses, the ultimate point is always the same and always reductive.</p> <p>But femaleness doesn't stop at the vagina. No, no, no! Many things happen via the magical vagina and it is one of these in particular that certain US politicians see as defining a woman. No, not cystitis, or vajazzling, although I'd love to hear Mitt Romney's thoughts on those pressing issues. No, it is motherhood.</p> <p>This was most obvious at the Republican and Democrat national conventions, in which the current and aspiring first ladies did the traditional schtick of attempting to appeal to women voters by telling Americans what great husbands they have. Whether being even a halfway decent president is in any way connected with being a great husband is a question I reckon Hillary Clinton and the late Jackie Kennedy Onassis could answer with more authority than me but that was not the point these women were hammering home. Rather, it was their role as mothers.</p> <p>Ann Romney announced at the beginning of her <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0NraMG2zImE\" title=\"\">sappy speech</a> that she would be talking \"not about politics, not about party\" \u2013 which raised the question why she was talking at the RNC at all \u2013 \"but love \u2026 that love so deep only a mother can fathom it\". It is mothers, according to Romney, \"who really hold this country together\" and while she was open-minded enough to include \"single, married, widowed\" in the varieties, the ultimate flavour was still the same: Mom. \"It's the moms who always have to work a little harder to make it right.\"</p> <p>Michelle Obama also played the mom card in her otherwise <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZTPdKUA9Ipg\" title=\"\">perfectly judged speech</a>, saying \"at the end of the day, my most important role is still 'mom-in-chief'\". Writer Tami Winfrey Harris <a href=\"http://www.clutchmagonline.com/2012/09/a-black-mom-in-chief-is-revolutionary-what-white-feminist-get-wrong-about-michelle-obama/\" title=\"\">wrote</a> recently in response to the disapproval Obama received for this, saying that critics are missing the point here: Obama is overturning old stereotypes about black women by presenting herself as \"nurturing, beautiful and stylish as well as whip smart, athletic and strong\". But in this instance, the line between \"overturning racial stereotypes\" and \"kowtowing to a gender status quo\" seems an awfully fine one.</p> <p>The Republicans have a problem with women, on various levels. They have a problem with getting women votes; Obama currently has a <a href=\"http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/14/poll-obama-holds-narrow-edge-over-romney/\" title=\"\">12-point advantage</a> over Romney among women and <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-11/obama-tops-romney-in-poll-with-2-1-backing-from-single-women.html\" title=\"\">a poll</a> in July said twice as many single women favour Obama over Romney. The Democrats, encouraged by this and by the Republican's move to the intractable right in regards to birth control, have been <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/09/05/dems_to_ladies_you_are_important/\" title=\"\">talking </a>about abortion and contraception with increasing boldness.</p> <p>The Republicans, by contrast, have become hysterically conservative and retrograde about birth control and abortion. Simultaneously, they venerate the concept of motherhood yet don't want to deal with the messy realities of it, which is why they can <a href=\"http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/09/07/1129098/-Mitt-Romney-s-women-s-ambassador-says-birth-control-is-off-message\" title=\"\">claim</a> that birth control is not an economic issue when it clearly is precisely that.</p> <p>Paul Ryan can <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/18/paul-ryan-mother-medicare-florida\" title=\"\">wax sentimental</a> about his dear mother while simultaneously proposing <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/08/13/how-would-a-vice-president-paul-ryan-affect-women.html\" title=\"\">cuts</a> to women's healthcare, <a href=\"http://www.cbpp.org/cms/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=3717\" title=\"\">cuts</a> to what was once known as the food stamp programme by $133.5bn (\u00a382bn) and removing exemptions in abortions, even for rape and incest victims. This is because the mothers they want to think about are rich mothers. (They also like thin ones: when Romney was <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/compost/post/romney-hearts-snooki-among-other-interview-highlights/2012/09/14/ed11e80c-fe8e-11e1-8adc-499661afe377_blog.html\" title=\"\">asked</a> recently who his favourite reality TV star was he replied that it is Snooki from Jersey Shore, who recently had a baby: \"Look how thin she's gotten! She's lost weight,\" he replied, like a magazine that applauds women who lose the \"baby weight\".) Thus, when Ann Romney was <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/election-2012/post/ann-romney-responds-to-democratic-pundit-saying-she-never-worked-a-day-in-her-life/2012/04/12/gIQApstpBT_blog.html\" title=\"\">accused</a> back in April of not being representative of most American women due to her $250m bank account, the Romney campaign insisted that her status as a mother somehow outweighed her financial situation, meaning she really is an everywoman, such is the mythical power of motherhood.</p> <p>Now, I'd like to state for the record that I love mothers. Hell, I even have one myself. But it should surely go without saying that, just as not all parents are women, not all women are mothers. This somewhat undermines the idea that emphasising Obama and Romney's maternal roles makes them \u2013 and by extension, their husbands \u2013 universally relatable. A woman's role as a mother is of undoubtedly central importance within her home but, at the risk of undermining this Norman Rockwell mentality in US politics, it's not really all that relevant to those outside it.</p> <p>Moreover, this conflation of women and mothers and valuing motherhood itself over women plays into the mentality of anti-choice advocates who believe that the woman herself doesn't matter: it's the baby who is important here, who defines her \u2013 she's just the carrier pod. Contrary to what too many politicians think, not all mothers are the same and not all women are mothers. Just as the vagina doth not make the woman, nor does the uterus.</p>",
  "<p>In May, something extremely rare happened: a federal court applied the US constitution to impose some limits on the powers of the president. That happened when federal district court judge Katherine Forrest of the southern district of New York, an Obama appointee, <a href=\"http://sdnyblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/12-Civ.-00331-2012.05.16-Opinion-Granting-PI.pdf\">preliminarily barred enforcement</a> of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), the statute enacted by Congress in December 2011 with broad bipartisan support and signed into law by President Obama (after he had threatened to veto it).</p> <p>That 2011 law expressly grants the president the power to indefinitely detain in military custody not only <em>accused</em> terrorists, but also <em>their supporters</em>, all without charges or trial. It does so by empowering the president to indefinitely detain not only al-Qaida members, but also members of so-called \"associated forces\", as well as anyone found to \"substantially support\" such forces \u2013 whatever those terms might mean. I <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2012/05/16/federal_court_enjoins_ndaa/\">wrote about that decision and the background to this case</a> when it was issued. </p> <p>What made Judge Forrest's ruling particularly remarkable is that the lawsuit was brought by eight journalists and activists, such as former New York Times reporter Chris Hedges, Daniel Ellsberg, Noam Chomsky, and Birgitta J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir, who argued that their work, which involves interactions with accused terrorists, could subject them to indefinite detention under the law's broad and vague authority,<em> even for US citizens on US soil</em>. The court agreed, noting that the plaintiffs presented \"evidence of concrete \u2013 non-hypothetical \u2013 ways in which the presence of the legislation has already impacted those expressive and associational activities\". The court was particularly disturbed by the Obama DOJ's adamant refusal to say, in response to being asked multiple times, that the law could not be used to indefinitely detain the plaintiffs due to their journalistic and political activities.</p> <p>Last week, Judge Forrest made her preliminary ruling permanent, issuing <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/432859-hedges-v-obama-injunction-2.html\">a 112-page decision</a> explaining it. Noting that the plaintiffs \"testified credibly to having an actual and reasonable fear that their activities will subject them to indefinite military detention\", she emphasized how dangerous this new law is given the extremely broad discretion it vests in the president to order people detained in military custody with no charges:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396332453\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/18/1347968278683/forest.png\" alt=\"forest ruling\" width=\"460\" height=\"320\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The court also brushed aside the Obama DOJ's prime argument, echoing the <a href=\"http://glenngreenwald.blogspot.com.br/2006/01/ideology-of-lawlessness.html\">theories of John Yoo</a>: namely, that courts have no business \"interfering\" in the president's conduct of war. After acknowledging that the president is entitled to deference in the national security realm, Judge Forrest dispensed with the Obama DOJ's claim with this vital observation: one that should be unnecessary but, in the 9/11 era, is all too commonly ignored:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396332454\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/18/1347968762065/forest2.png\" alt=\"forest ruling 2\" width=\"460\" height=\"378\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>In other words: while the president is entitled to deference in his conduct of war, he's not entitled to wield the power to order people, including American citizens, indefinitely imprisoned in military detention. Regardless of how he claims he intends to exercise this power, the mere act of vesting it in him so chills the exercise of first amendment and other protected rights that the constitution can have no meaning if courts permit it to stand.</p> <p>In response to this ruling, the Obama administration not only filed an immediate appeal, but they filed an emergency motion asking the appeals court to lift the injunction pending the appeal. Obama lawyers <a href=\"http://www.documentcloud.org/documents/433357-hedges-motion-to-stay-2nd-circuit.html\">wrote a breathless attack</a> on the court's ruling, denouncing it as \"vastly troubling\" and claiming that it \"threatens tangible and dangerous consequences in the conduct of an active military conflict\" and \"threatens irreparable harm to national security\".</p> <p>The Obama DOJ also objected that the decision \"was entered against the president as commander-in-chief in his conduct of ongoing military operations, is unprecedented and exceeded the court's authority\": how irreverent. And they argued that the broad detention power claimed by President Obama \"has been endorsed by two presidents [meaning him and George W Bush], by the [rightwing] DC circuit in habeas litigation brought by Guant\u00e1namo detainees, and by the Congress in Section 1021(b)(2).\"</p> <p>I've <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2011/12/16/three_myths_about_the_detention_bill/\">written at length before</a> about why indefinite detention is so dangerous, and why a statute such as the NDAA \u2013 which purposely (as the court here found) leaves open the question of whether it applies to US citizens \u2013 is one of the most pernicious laws enacted in some time. I won't rehash that here, but I do want to make two points about the Obama administration's new fight in defense of this law.</p> <p><em>First</em>, the Obama administration's unhinged claim that Judge Forrest's ruling imperils national security gives the lie to the <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2011/12/16/three_myths_about_the_detention_bill/\">central excuse for the NDAA</a>: namely, that it does not expand the president's detention powers beyond what is already vested by the <a href=\"http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-107publ40/html/PLAW-107publ40.htm\">2001 Authorization to Use Military Force</a> (AUMF). Judge Forrest's ruling leaves the 2001 AUMF in place and did not purport to nullify any prior decisions applying it. Therefore, if the NDAA does nothing that the 2001 AUMF did not already do \u2013 as Obama defenders relentlessly claimed to justify his signing of this odious bill \u2013 then it cannot possibly be the case that Judge Forrest's ruling harms national security, since Obama already has all the detention power he claims he needs under the 2001 AUMF.</p> <p>The reality is that the NDAA did indeed wildly expand the president's detention powers beyond what the 2001 AUMF provided. In contrast to the 2001 AUMF \u2013 which empowered the president to act against a relatively narrow category: those \"he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on 11 September 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons\" \u2013 the NDAA empowers him to act against a much broader range of people: not only those who perpetrated 9/11, but also \"associated forces\", and not only those who are members of such groups, but those who \"substantially support\" them.</p> <p>While the Bush and Obama DOJs have long absurdly interpreted the 2001 AUMF to apply to this broader range, and while some courts have accepted that interpretation, the law itself vested no such power. The NDAA <em>did</em>. That is why civil liberties groups such as the ACLU <a href=\"http://www.aclu.org/national-security/president-obama-signs-indefinite-detention-bill-law\">denounced Obama's signing of it so vociferously</a>, and it is why the Obama DOJ is so horrified, obviously, by the prospect that it will be invalidated: precisely because it so drastically expands their detention power. Both the court's ruling and the Obama DOJ's reaction to that ruling prove that the NDAA does indeed provide the president with significantly enhanced authority of indefinite detention.</p> <p><em>Second</em>, to see the sorry and wretched state of liberties in the US under President Obama, let us look to Afghanistan. The US is currently attempting to turn over to the Afghan government control of the lawless prison system the US has long maintained in Bagram and other parts of that country. But that effort is running into a serious problem: namely, the US wants the prisoners to remain there in cages without charges, but the Afghans are insisting that indefinite detention violates their belief in due process. From an <a href=\"http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ggpHowv0PAy_skdOC1tSR9g1Gx6A?docId=d81b0861a5424214a83b225f63ca647e\">Associated Press article Monday</a> headlined \"Afghans reject US-favored administrative detention\":</p> <blockquote> <p>\"An Afghan judicial panel ruled Monday that administrative detention violates Afghan law, potentially thwarting a US plan to hand over Afghan detainees that American officials believe should continue to be held without a trial.</p> <p>\"President Hamid Karzai's office announced in a statement that a top-level judicial panel met earlier in the day and decided that the detention of Afghan citizens without a court trial 'has not been foreseen in Afghan laws' and therefore could not be used.</p> <p>\"The US government has long held Afghans captured in operations inside the country without trial, arguing that they are enemy combatants and therefore can be detained for as long as their release might pose a danger to the international coalition \u2026</p> <p>\"A US official confirmed that the transfer of detainees had paused because of the dispute.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>Is that not amazing? On the very same day that the Obama DOJ fights vigorously in US courts for the right to imprison people without charges, the Afghan government fights just as vigorously for basic due process.</p> <p>Remember: the US, we're frequently told, is in Afghanistan to bring democracy to the Afghan people and to teach them about freedom. But the Afghan government is refusing the US demand to imprison people without charges on the ground that such lawless detention violates their conceptions of basic freedom. Maybe Afghanistan should invade the US in order to teach Americans about freedom.</p> <p>This is not the first time this has happened. In 2009, <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/23/AR2009102303709.html\">the Obama administration decided</a> that it wanted to target certain Afghan citizens for due process-free assassinations on the ground that the targets to be executed were drug \"kingpins\". They were to be killed based solely on US accusations, with no trial, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/07/world/middleeast/07yemen.html?hp\">just as the Obama administration does with its own citizens</a>. But again, that plan ran into a roadblock: Afghan leaders were horrified by the notion that their citizens would be extrajudicially executed based on unproven suspicions [my emphasis]:</p> <blockquote> <p>\"A US military hit list of about 50 suspected drug kingpins is drawing fierce opposition from Afghan officials, who say it could undermine their fragile justice system and trigger a backlash against foreign troops. </p> <p>\"The US military and Nato officials have authorized their forces to kill or capture individuals on the list, which was drafted within the past year as part of Nato's new strategy to combat drug operations that finance the Taliban \u2026</p> <p>\"General Mohammad Daud Daud, Afghanistan's deputy interior minister for counternarcotics efforts, praised US and British special forces for their help recently in destroying drug labs and stashes of opium. But he said he worried that foreign troops would now act on their own to kill suspected drug lords,<em> based on secret evidence, instead of handing them over for trial.</em></p> <p><em>\"'They should respect our law, our constitution and our legal codes,' Daud said. 'We have a commitment to arrest these people on our own'</em> \u2026</p> <p>\"There is a constitutional problem here. A person is innocent unless proven guilty,\" [former Afghan interior minister Ali Ahmad Jalali] said. \"If you go off to kill or capture them, how do you prove that they are really guilty in terms of legal process?\"</p> </blockquote> <p>In other words, the Obama administration has received far more resistance to its due process-free imprisonments and assassinations from Afghans than it has from its own citizens in the US. If only more Americans, including progressives, were willing to point out the most basic truths in response to these Obama power seizures, such as: \"If you go off to kill or capture them, how do you prove that they are really guilty in terms of legal process?\" </p> <p>Instead, many Americans, particularly in the age of Obama, are content to assume that anyone whom the US government accuses of being a terrorist should, for that reason alone, be assumed to be guilty, and as a result, any punishment the president decides to dole out \u2013 indefinite imprisonment, summary execution \u2013 is warranted and just; no bothersome, obsolete procedures such as \"trials\" or \"indictments\" are necessary. </p> <p>It is that mindset that will ensure that Obama's vigorous fight to preserve the power of indefinite detention will provoke so little objection: among Americans, that is \u2013 though obviously not among Afghans, who seem to have an actual understanding of, and appreciation for, the value of due process.</p>",

When the polio-stricken Franklin D Roosevelt was elected president of the US in 1932, no photos were ever printed (and few taken) that revealed the scale of his disability to voters. When Hitler did a jig by the Eiffel Tower the footage wasn't shown on French TV. It was not what conquerers were supposed to do. The infant industry of PR knew that.<br>But today the image-shaping PR men are in a constant battle with YouTube, iPhones and Twitter. When Vince Cable was caught in a Daily Telegraph honeytrap, taped making abusive remarks about coalition Tories, older MPs on all sides were offended on his behalf. But the younger ones I consulted at the time said \"Silly old Vince, nowadays you have to assume you are being recorded at all times.\"</p> <p>A popular figure can still get away with it. Richard Nixon's snarling and profane self-revelation in the Watergate tapes contradicted his public Quaker piety, whereas Ronald Reagan's joke about declaring war on Russia (he didn't realise the mic was live) reinforced his sunny image. John Major complaining about the cabinet's Eurosceptic \"<a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/1993/jul/25/politicalnews.uk\" title=\"\">bastards</a>\" \u2013 a private remark picked up by a still-live mic \u2013 reinforced an air of helpless victimhood.

When Jeremy Hunt assured TV viewers that the Olympic team was ready for all eventualities none of his minders could anticipate that the bell the minister was about to ring would have a wonky handle. The bell shot off the handle and nearly brained a voter.

If Romney wins, his slagging off of 47% of the voters was a mere bump in the road to the White House. \"Hey, 53% didn't mind at all.\" But retrospective insight can be ominous. Did no one warn tiny Michael Dukakis, George Bush's Democratic opponent in 1988, that he'd look silly in a helmet inside a tank? Was Neil Kinnock's nine-year campaign for No 10 doomed on that first fateful afternoon when the newly-elected Labour leader and his wife, Glenys, did a photo-op on Brighton beach and were caught by a wave? Come to think of it did no one ask if David Miliband should grip that suggestive banana? Or was the choice of fruit Ed's idea?</p>",
  "<p>There are three inducements of support that Americans are powerless against: the promise of whiter teeth, the suggestion of no-diet weight loss and the cause of justice.</p> <p>Political campaigns tend to couch their appeals in terms of the last, though parts of the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/17/paul-ryan-tax-loopholes_n_1890790.html\">Romney-Ryan economic pitch</a> could be described as the second. In today's truly divisive debates, both parties have usually engineered a rhetorical claim to the side of fairness: gay rights advocates propelled themselves forward when they began to argue for \"marriage equality\" against the outdated complaint of \"special rights\".</p> <p>Americans rankle at unearned privileges as much as they rally, in the main, to equality. Hence the widespread, enthusiastic support of voter ID laws (they <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/poll-concerns-about-voter-fraud-spur-broad-support-for-voter-id-laws/2012/08/11/40db3aba-e2fb-11e1-ae7f-d2a13e249eb2_story.html\">poll</a> with about 75% in favor) makes total sense if you see the laws exactly the way their authors and promoters talk about them \u2013 as barriers to voter fraud. After all, voter fraud is when criminals unfairly manipulate voting, the most basic expression of fairness available in a democracy.</p> <p>Asking Americans if they support measures against voter fraud is like asking if they support measures against adults suiting up for Little League baseball. The problem is that there are probably more cheaters in baseball than voting: a recent analysis found cases of alleged voter fraud running about one for every 16,000 voters. What's more, voter ID laws work in such a way that a no-adults-in-Little-League equivalent would ban not just grownups from playing, but also anyone who looked adult-<em>ish</em> and didn't show up for practice with documentary evidence of minor status.</p> <p>The metaphor breaks down pretty quickly, however, and not just because a tall-person-free Little League might wind up still being a decent pastime for those involved (the tall people could play elsewhere). In real-life democracy, there is no farm team. You either get to play or you don't. What's more \u2013 as American as playing baseball is \u2013 it's not <a href=\"http://www.aclu.org/timelines/timeline-voting-rights-act\">a legal right</a>.</p> <p>The pre-eminence of voting as a right, and not a privilege, is where the facile arguments that make voter ID laws sound so commonsensical falter as well: </p> <blockquote> <p>\"You have to show a picture ID to buy Sudafed \u2026 you have to show a picture ID to set foot on an airplane.\"</p> </blockquote> <p>So went South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley's argument at the <a href=\"http://m.npr.org/news/U.S./160884806\">Republican convention</a>. So why not to vote? Somehow, this is not a line of reasoning conservatives favor when it comes to buying a gun, but no matter! Let's agree that the risks of someone with bad intentions buying Sudafed, or getting on a plane are bad enough that it makes sense to err on the side of caution. The ID-less people who want to buy Sudafed just to treat a head cold, or who are badly organized travelers, do not suffer overmuch \u2013 and have other options.</p> <p>By contrast, those with good intentions and blameless records who are barred from legally casting a ballot because they lack ID are not just being inconvenienced; they are being denied the right that defines democracy. Voting is so important to democracy's functioning as an equalizing force that it is the first thing those in power deny the minority and the last thing they grant. Campaigns for voter ID laws may have multiplied dramatically in recent years, but they are far from new. They are simply an innovation in a decades-long campaign to deny those <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/12/voter-id-laws minorities_n_1878893.html\">at the margins</a> \u2013 blacks, the poor, the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rebecca-schleifer/disabled-voting rights_b_1853234.html\">disabled</a> \u2013 the right to representation.</p> <p>As Republicans' economic agenda pushes us further toward a winner-take-all society, their state-level legislative voter ID agenda shows an impulse to eliminate other players entirely.</p> <p>As personal and private as voting is, the forces at work to deny the franchise have been subsumed by larger, technocratic forces. The biggest threat to voting rights posed by activists such as \"<a href=\"http://www.truethevote.org/\">True the Vote</a>\" \u2013 a conservative outfit claiming to ferret out voter fraud \u2013 is not intimidation at the polls <em>or</em> requiring voter ID: it's computer-driven, human-assisted purges of voter rolls, often brought about by private citizens \"alerting\" local governments to possible fraud, but also instigated by Republican officials.</p> <p>Called \"caging\", this technique often relies on using returned mail as proof that the voter has registered illegally (under a false address) \u2013 no matter if the voter has moved but retains residency in the state. This method produces very favorable results in areas with high foreclosure rates, like \u2026 well, everywhere, really. The best-known example of caging is from 2000 in Florida, with an attempt to clear the voter rolls of felons using a computerized list that wound up <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/blogs/national-affairs/florida-gop-takes-voter-supression-to-a-brazen-new-extreme-20120530\">striking</a> 12,000 eligible citizens. </p> <p>There are no witnesses to these purges, no ugly footage to brandish on the evening news. What's more, there is not an equal and opposing force: no computer program that can create a list of people who <em>should</em> be allowed to vote. The <a href=\"http://www.demos.org/press-release/strong-enforcement-voter-protections-needed-colorado-stop-%E2%80%9Cbullies-ballot-box%E2%80%9D\">Common Cause/Demos paper last week</a> that spurred some the current coverage of voter ID makes suggestions for leveling the playing field, such as making challenges to voter registration as individuated as possible (requiring a signed affidavit for each challenge, for instance). </p> <p>In the end, though, once challenged, the only way for a would-be voter to push back is by a literal act of personal integrity: showing up at the county registrar's office or hearing, usually. While I can imagine the satisfaction of telling a conservative activist who has challenged my rights to \"say that to my face\", the fact is that if someone has been challenged because he or she has no driver's license or is struggling with permanent housing, they may not even find out they've been challenged.</p> <p>Many of the arguments for voter ID laws and other anti-fraud measures make sense in the abstract: yes, voter fraud is bad! But nothing about voting is abstract. It is an inherently physical act; it is about what country one chooses to call home. In theoretical terms, psychologists still puzzle over why people vote at all. It would be more logical, more immediately self-serving to not vote. Voting takes time and effort and, in the grand scheme of things, one vote doesn't matter. Unless it's yours. </p> <p>Ultimately, people vote so that they can continue to do so.</p>",
  "<p>In the leaked video <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/09/secret-video-romney-private-fundraiser\" title=\"\">published by Mother Jones</a>, Mitt Romney claimed that 47% of Americans \"pay no income tax\", people who he could \"never convince \u2026 to take personal responsibility and care for their lives\".</p> <p>He described such people as those \"who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to healthcare, to food, to housing, to you-name-it\".</p> <p>At a press conference designed to limit the damage to his election campaign, he did not disavow the claim but said Obama's policies are \"attractive to people who do not pay taxes\".</p> <p>Romney's headline assertion that 47% of Americans pay no income tax is almost correct, assuming he was referring to federal income tax. <a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/numbers/displayatab.cfm?DocID=3054\" title=\"\">The Tax Policy Centre said that in 2011 46.4% of people paid no federal income tax</a>. But his suggestion that such people do not \"take personal responsibility and care for their lives\" warrants further investigation.</p> <p>Firstly, some of those people who did not pay income tax still paid payroll taxes, for social security and Medicare, so that it was only 18.1% of households that did not pay any income or payroll taxes. Given that there are sales taxes, state property taxes and state income taxes these people are still paying some tax \u2013 at what point you are deemed to be taking personal responsibility is subjective.</p> <p>Of the 18.1% paying no income or payroll taxes, <a href=\"http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxtopics/federal-taxes-households.cfm\" title=\"\">more than half (10.3% of all households) were elderly</a>, so retired people who may well have paid income and payroll taxes, as well as others, during their working lives. Of the remainder, 6.9% of all households did not pay income or payroll taxes, essentially because they were poor, leaving 1% of \"others\" who did not pay either of these two types of taxes. Presumably, within the \"others\" category would fall the likes of <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/janetnovack/2012/09/17/memo-to-mitt-romney-the-47-pay-taxes-too/\" title=\"\">six of the 400 US tax filers in 2009 with the highest adjusted gross income (at least $77m), who, according to Internal Revenue Service studies, paid no US income tax, and the 19,551 US households with income above $200,000 who owed no US or foreign income tax.</a></p> <p>The percentage of people paying no federal income tax was even higher in 2008 and 2009 (50.8% in each of those years) but it is no coincidence that such figures have gone up during a recession (the figure was 39.9% in 2007).</p> <p><a href=\"http://taxvox.taxpolicycenter.org/2010/04/15/about-those-47-percent-who-pay-%E2%80%9Cno-taxes-%E2%80%9D/\" title=\"\">Howard Gleckman wrote for Tax Policy Centre about the situation in 2009</a>: \"You may have noticed that we've had a recession lately. And here is a powerful insight: When people's incomes decline so too does their income tax (at least most of the time) ... there is, however, another reason why some people don't pay. For decades, both Democratic and Republican governments have made conscious policy decisions to remove low-income working families from the income tax rolls. And, guess what, sometimes government policy works exactly as intended. That's what happened this time.\"</p> <p><a href=\"http://theagenda.nytimes.com/post/31758381202/a-closer-look-at-the-47-percent\" title=\"\">Michael Cooper for the New York Times writes</a>: \"A major reason that many poor people no longer pay federal income taxes is the Earned Income Tax Credit, which has long been supported by Republicans. The credit was added to the tax code when Gerald Ford was president, and was expanded by President Reagan in 1986 and by George Bush Sr.\"</p> <p>So would Romney like to see higher taxes? Or perhaps just for the poor?</p>",

  "<p>A nice chap and a decent one, Ed Miliband. I hope the Labour leader savours the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2012/sep/18/hague-afghanistan-politics-live-blog\" title=\"\">15% lead over the divided and demoralised Tories</a> \u2013 it's 12%, according to YouGov in the Sun - which today's Times/Populus poll reports that his party now commands. All I would otherwise advise him to do is not believe a word of it. More than is usually the case, no one can be confident of winning the next election. As in 2010 they may all lose.</p> <p>These are tough times for major party leaders, reflecting voter dismay that goes beyond the travails of protracted recession to general disappointment with politics and politicians. That can be seen in the 15% share of voter preferences going to that underrated party, \"others\" - which can include everyone from the BNP and Greens to Ukip, SNP and the Probably Will Not Vote party.</p> <p>Why should Miliband Junior not feel confident that he's making progress towards obtaining the keys of No 10? The coalition's policies are widely felt to be both unfair and not working \u2013 especially in the central sphere of economic retrenchment as the key to recovery. Several polls have been reporting that more voters share the Labour line \u2013 pay off the debt more slowly \u2013 than the coalition's austerity priority. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/video/2012/sep/04/george-osborne-booed-paralympics-video?INTCMP=SRCH\" title=\"\">George Osborne is booed at the Olympic Stadium</a>.</p> <p>There is also talk of revolts within the Tory ranks, of ever-deeper splits between the coalition partners, plots against David Cameron, \"Boris for King\" chatter. As John Major - and he should know \u2013 warned on the Sunday TV sofa, the Tories should have learned from his tottering status after 1992 that regicide is usually a bad policy. Even kamikazes like the Mail's <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2204755/David-Cameron-Ive-fiercest-critic-I-agree-itd-madness-Tories-dump-him.html\" title=\"\">Simon (\" I am no admirer, but\") Heffer now grasp that</a>.</p> <p>The party has never quite recovered from killing off Lady Thatcher in 1990. Legitimacy, once lost, is hard to recover, that's one lesson we were supposed to have learned from the Wars of the Roses. That Bolingbroke, eh? William Hague once quipped that the Tories work on the principle of \"autocracy tempered by regicide\" - yet Hague and all leaders since have suffered the recurring plots.</p> <p>But, but, but. Young Ed probably knows as well as you and I do that his poll lead is partly down to mid-term blues, a routine cyclical event. Remember that Labour's 24% over the Thatcher-led Tories in 1990 failed to deliver victory in 1992, though in fairness both Thatcher and her poll tax had been thrown overboard in the meantime.</p> <p>Opposition parties that go on to win the next election are usually further ahead than Labour's usual 8% to 10% since 2010 \u2013 15% is, I think, the highest recorded since the election. But Tony Blair was up to 40% ahead before his 1997 landslide. Today's polling puts Cameron well ahead of Miliband as the leader voters prefer for No 10 - by 60% to 31% with more than half that 60% saying they are not pleased with Dave, but see him as the lesser evil.</p> <p>It's true that the Tories usually run their affairs on the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F%C3%BChrerprinzip\" title=\"\">F\u00fchrerprinzip \u2013 the \"leader principle\"</a>, which grants sweeping powers on condition of success, whereas Labour's history and temper is more collectivist and cautious (it NEVER sacks its elected leader). But TV politics has focused attention on the leader and everywhere he/she is now more crucial than ever.</p> <p>So a perception that still favours Cameron \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/video/2012/sep/12/hillsborough-disaster-david-cameron-video\" title=\"\">he did well on the Hillsborough statement</a>, didn't he? - matters a lot. There has also been reporting this week that all sections of society will see a modest rise in incomes next year. If true that may help keep the coalition partners afloat, as will the gentle collapse in the weeks ahead of the Boris Bubble and the Lib Dems' own Vince Vapours.</p> <p>Clegg is going to soldier on too, battered and bloodied, but still standing. He fought Michael Gove to a respectable draw over GCSE reform this month \u2013 how respectable only time will tell, but he's learning.</p> <p>And when Newsnight's Allegra Stratton \u2013 my old Guardian colleague \u2013 reports (as she did last night) that ministers are considering linking next year's increases in benefits (not pensions) to wage increases, not inflation, to save money, I doubt if it will make them more unpopular among most voters, however unfair it sounds. If they actually do it, of course. We have been here before.</p> <p>It is the f\u00fchrerprinzip that is slowly undoing Mitt Romney's campaign for the White House. As you will have heard overnight he was caught out <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/18/romney-secret-video-government-dependent\" title=\"\">dismissing Democrat voters \u2013 all of them \u2013 as victims dependent on entitlements from the state</a>, a shockingly stupid as well as immoral thing to say, especially at a time when the label can more plausibly be hung round Wall Street's neck.</p> <p>I was listening to a clever banker only the other day who said that bankers are like alcoholics: there will be no cure until they admit there's a problem. At least Cameron and Osborne know this which may be why \u2013 as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/sep/17/conservatives-expect-barack-obama-reelection\" title=\"\">Patrick Wintour reports today</a> \u2013 they are already preparing for a second Obama term. Whether or not the president deserves it is discussed by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/17/barack-obama-election-gary-younge\" title=\"\">Gary Young here in G2</a>.</p> <p>Can Miliband win in 2015? Perhaps, though plenty of old Labour hands, not all of them admirers of brother David, privately doubt it. In today's Telegraph, doughty columnist, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/labour/9548336/The-Tories-keep-swiping-but-Ed-Miliband-is-an-elusive-target.html\" title=\"\">Mary Riddell, argues that Red Ed is an elusive target for the Tories</a> and that Gove's reforms are essentially Blairite. On <a href=\"http://conservativehome.blogs.com/majority_conservatism/2012/09/if-george-osborne-could-have-designed-an-ideal-labour-opposition-he-would-have-chosen-the-ed-miliban.html\" title=\"\">ConservativeHome Tim Montgomerie argues that both Eds \u2013 especially Ed Balls \u2013 are sitting targets</a> for Tory election planners, who are simply keeping their powder dry.</p> <p>In that context opinion polls which suggest the coalition is hopelessly unpopular and that Labour only has to sit back and reap its reward do Miliband and Balls no favours. The \"Age of Ed\" \u2013 as over-excited Cameron-bashers are already calling it \u2013 is not upon us. Labour remains vulnerable on tax-and-spend, more Kinnockite than Blairite, on welfare reform and immigration to name three high voter priorities.</p> <p>I suspect Miliband knows all this, but he did volunteer for the job. Oddly enough the complacent view that \"this time it's different\" may be right but with uncertain consequences. The YouGov pollster, Peter Kellner, is reminding audiences that 59% of voters now fear for their children's future against 23% who think it will be OK.</p> <p>Given that the economy has usually been growing at 2% to 2.5% for decades \u2013 it isn't doing that now \u2013 this underlying trend points to a doubling of national wealth ever generation or so. If voters fear that won't happen in the future, that's a scary disconnect for any political leader \u2013 here or elsewhere \u2013 a headwind that may lead to another hung parliament and some sort of coalition after 2015.</p> <p>But even in uncertainty optimism is the best note to adopt. Cameron shows he knows that. Does Ed?</p>",
  "<p>Mitt Romney's presidential campaign is in turmoil after he was secretly recorded suggesting that 47% of Americans were <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/18/romney-secret-video-government-dependent\" title=\"\">government-dependent \"victims\"</a> who did not pay taxes. The video, recorded a few months ago at a behind-closed-doors fundraising event, has been <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/09/secret-video-romney-private-fundraiser\" title=\"\">published by Mother Jones</a> with election day seven weeks away. Some of the other figures associated with the story are:</p> <h2>Marc Leder</h2> <p>The private equity fund boss organised the fundraiser in Boca Raton, Florida, at which Mitt Romney made the comments. Leder was <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/business/in-a-romney-believer-private-equitys-risks-and-rewards.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">reportedly inspired to get into private equity</a> after a visit, years ago, to Romney's investment firm. Romney was an early investor in Leder's business, Sun Capital, which has grown to oversee about $8bn (\u00a35bn) in equity. Since 2008, 25 of its companies \u2013 about one in every five it owns \u2013 have filed for bankruptcy, according to the New York Times. Leder and his defenders say many of the businesses in which Sun Capital invests are already in trouble when purchased, and that he has saved many companies and jobs. He is <a href=\"http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/nude_frolic_in_tycoon_pool_S8t8KXKG1IeGFSDtN6Xm9M\" title=\"\">alleged to have hosted debauched parties</a> including one at which a couple performed sex acts in front of other guests. Leder says the media portrayal of him as a party animal is \"absolutely incorrect\". He says: \"I spend a small percentage throwing some parties, attending some parties. I like music. I like to dance.\"</p> <h2>James Carter</h2> <p>The grandson of the former president Jimmy Carter is credited as a \"research assistant\" on the story published by Mother Jones about Romney's gaffe. On his <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JECarter4\" title=\"\">Twitter profile</a>, Carter describes himself as \"looking for work\". He <a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2012/09/james-carter-iv-helped-spread-secret-romney-video.html\" title=\"\">told New York magazine</a>: \"I've been searching for clips on Republicans for a long time, almost every day. I just do it for fun.\" He said he spotted the clip on YouTube and tracked down the person who claimed to have secretly taped and uploaded the video. Carter could be forgiven for enjoying a sense of schadenfreude given that Romney has tried to hurt Obama by comparing him to Carter's grandfather. Romney has accused both men of being weak <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/Big-Peace/2012/09/13/Team-Romney-on-Obama-s-Foreign-Policy-It-s-Amateur-Hour?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter\" title=\"\">on foreign policy</a>, in the wake of the killing of the US ambassador to Libya, Chris Stevens, and <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/03/us-usa-campaign-idUSBRE83Q1DF20120503\" title=\"\">on the economy</a>.</p> <h2>David Corn</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-image-396317039\"> <img src=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2012/9/18/1347967708146/David-Corn-004.jpg\" alt=\"David Corn\" width=\"220\" height=\"132\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Corn.

He said only that the case was not \"elegantly stated\" and that he had \"spoken off the cuff\".</p> <p>He was speaking after a secret video recording was posted on a website in which he was caught denigrating people who receive benefits from the government. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XnB0NZzl5HA?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"276\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/XnB0NZzl5HA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>He went on suggest they could expect little help from him if he became president.</p> <p>\"My job is not to worry about those people,\" he said. </p> <p>He added that all these government-dependent people would support Barack Obama.</p> <p>The video was recorded a few months ago at a fund-raising event behind-closed-doors.</p> <p>The release of the video is the most damaging episode yet in a campaign filled with Romney mishaps. His campaign is in danger of turning into one of the most ineptly-run in recent US political history, though there are still seven weeks left to turn it round.</p> <p>The Obama campaign described the video as \"shocking\".</p> <p>In his press conference, in California, Romney basically repeated the case he made in the video that the 47% dependent on the government would vote for Obama, though couched in slightly less inflammatory language. Obama's policies are \"attractive to people who do not pay taxes\", Romney said.</p> <p>Romney tends to avoid the press as much as possible and it is a sign of the seriousness of the situation that he had to make an impromptu statement. He attempted to pose his comments as part of a broader philosophical debate about the future of America. \"Do you believe in a government-centered society that provides more and more benefits? Or do you believe instead in a free enterprise society where people are able to pursue their dreams?\"</p> <p>He insisted he wanted to help all Americans.</p> <p>While his views about people dependent on the government will be applauded by parts of the right, he risks alienating independents who do not share his view of American society and also motivating disgruntled Democrats who may have otherwise have abstained in the 6 November election to get out and vote.</p> <p>It also plays into the portrait that the Democrats have been gradually building of Romney as an extremely wealthly individual who is out of touch with working-class and middle-class Americans.</p> <p>At a bare minimum, the controversy ensures it will be the dominant theme of the week, with Romney forced on the defensive again, with detailed discussion of who precisely constitutes the 47%. </p> <p>It also means that the issue of how much he himself paid in taxes will resurface, with calls for him to release his tax returns beyond the two years he has volunteered.</p> <p>The video, was posted on the website of the liberal Mother Jones magazine. It came only hours after the Romney campaign acknowledged it is struggling when it announced it was to change strategy. Romney is trailing Obama in the polls by about three percentage points.</p> <p>In the video, Romney said: \"All right, there are 47% who are with him (Obama), who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to healthcare, to food, to housing, to you-name-it.\"</p> <p>He added: \"These are people who pay no income tax.\"</p> <p>Apart from offending a large part of the population, the comment is also inaccurate. Many of those he includes in the 47% do pay tax.

The 47% are not people who pay no income tax and encompasses sections of the population who have earned their entitlements.</p> <p>Earlier in the day, the Romney campaign said it would attempt to give a clearer, more positive picture of their candidate as it seeks to regain the initiative with just 50 days to go until the election.</p> <p>The new strategy will not abandon negative campaigning, but will focus on positive ads as well as speeches to spell out the Romney would pursue in office, in particular his five-point economic plan.</p> <p>The latest polls show Obama's large post-convention poll bounce beginning to narrow. A Gallup poll recorded a drop from 7% last week to 3%, with the president on 48% to Romney's 45%.</p> <p>But the problem for the Romney campaign is less Obama's post-convention bounce and more the fact that the Republican failed to secure any bounce at all.</p> <p>Romney began his campaign early in the summer intent on making the election about Obama's economic record and making himself as small a target as possible by disclosing little about his own policies.</p> <p>But since then there has barely been a clear week in which Romney has been able to get his message across, either because of a barrage of ads on his record as chief executive of Bain Capital and his unwillingness to release more than two years' worth of tax records, or because of gaffes on his own side.</p> <p>Romney's trip to Britain, Israel and Poland, which was intended to showcase him as a figure of some standing in the international community, quickly went askew.</p> <p>His position on abortion became a week-long issue after Todd Akin, a Republican congressman in Missouri running for the Senate, talked about \"legitimate rape\". Hurricane Isaac disrupted the Republican convention.</p> <p>Then, last week, Romney issued a hasty response to the evolving Middle East crisis, essentially accusing Obama of appeasement.</p> <p>His rash comment, from which many senior Republicans distanced themselves, dominated the news in the US for days after the killing of US ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans, and the spotlight is only now beginning to turn to Obama's policy on the Middle East and North Africa.</p>",
  "<p>Downing Street officials are preparing for what they expect will be victory for Barack Obama in the US presidential election in November and defeat for Mitt Romney, the Republican challenger, who is a natural Tory ally.</p> <p>Conservatives made strenuous efforts in the spring to build up their Republican links, including a meeting between the chancellor, George Osborne, and Paul Ryan, now Romney's vice-presidential candidate. But they believe there is a strong personal relationship between Obama and David Cameron that dwarfs any political differences.</p> <p>Conservatives feel that the Democrats realise the Tories are not on the Tea Party right and that striking similarities exist between their respective deficit-reduction programmes.</p> <p>Cameron and Obama are entering a critical phase in their relationship, with the UK presidency of the G8 world leaders in 2013 and troop withdrawals from Afghanistan on the horizon.</p> <p>Obama appears to have gained some political momentum since the party conventions, taking small leads in many swing states, which has prompted some Republican infighting before three critical televised presidential debates.</p> <p>Conservatives have been taken by the central message of Obama's convention speech, calling on voters to be patient and recognise that the hard path he has chosen is the only one that leads to a better future.</p> <p>\"The truth is it will take more than a few years for us to solve challenges that have built up over decades. It will require common effort, shared responsibility, and bold, persistent experimentation,\" Obama said.</p> <p>Conservative strategists believe the British public are receptive to a hard long-term message from government incumbents, and believe Ed Miliband has left himself vulnerable for failing to take tough decisions. Cameron is still beating Miliband in many polls asking who would make a good prime minister.</p> <p>The strategists take comfort from the fact that although they are often trailing Labour by 10 points, the bulk of Labour's lead has been amassed by Tory voters switching to Ukip, or by former Liberal Democrat voters deserting Nick Clegg's party. They believe few former Tory voters have switched directly to Miliband because of his actions or leadership.</p> <p>Conservatives believe that voters recognise the UK economy is locked into an ever more competitive global contest for jobs, and will portray Labour's deficit-cutting plans as superficially attractive comfort food that is ultimately damaging. Cameron and Osborne expect the new Conservative chairman, Grant Shapps, to mount an increasingly pointed attack on Ed Balls' spending plans.</p> <p>Officials expect that the two most challenging political reports facing the government this autumn will be that of the Leveson inquiry into media ethics, and the Office of Budget Responsibility's verdict on the feasibility of the government meeting its long-term debt-reduction plans. Both are expected in November.</p> <p>Some government officials are taking soundings with newspaper owners about whether they would accept any form of independent regulation with statutory underpinning.</p> <p>Resistance continues among many proprietors.</p> <p>One proposal regarded favourably within parts of Downing Street is the regulatory oversight provided by the Advertising Standards Authority \u2013 a system described as self-regulation within a co-regulatory framework. The ASA system is underpinned by an enabling statutory instrument, &#xa0;and a formal memorandum of understanding between Ofcom&#xa0;and the ASA.</p> <p>Cameron, currently on better terms with the right-of-centre press, will have to make a political judgment on how far to press the media. Many in the party believe Leveson has made his task more difficult by allowing the inquiry to roam so widely, including exploring the circumstances of News Corp's bid for BSkyB. Labour has opened a 15-point lead over the Conservatives, according to a Times/Populus poll last night. There was some comfort for the prime minister, however, as the poll showed 60% of respondents wanted Cameron to remain in his post. The poll put Labour on 45%, the Tories on 30%, and the Lib Dems on 10%.</p>"
